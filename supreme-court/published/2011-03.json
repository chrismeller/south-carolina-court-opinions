Basso were the only signatories to the annexation petition.[1]Â \r\n  The State, which is the presumptive owner of the annexed marshlands, did not\r\n  sign the petition.Â  Notwithstanding the absence of the State's consent to the\r\n  annexation, the annexation ordinance recites that the Town received a petition\r\n  signed &quot;by all persons owning real estate&quot; in the annexed area.\r\nThe annexation petition was\r\n  expressly contingent on the Town's approval of a development agreement.Â  This\r\n  agreement permitted the annexed property to be developed with single and\r\n  multiple family homes, parks, equestrian facilities, golf courses, and\r\n  commercial, office, and retail buildings.\r\nAppellants Campbell, Kinsey, Yisrael, and\r\n  Coastal Conservation League (hereinafter, the &quot;Private Party\r\n  Appellants&quot;) filed a complaint challenging the annexation.Â  Appellants\r\n  Campbell and Kinsey are the co-owners of approximately 1000 acres of land in Beaufort County abutting Binden Plantation.Â  Their property shares a border with Binden for\r\n  approximately one mile.Â  Appellant Yisrael is a freeholder[2] and resident of the Town.Â  Campbell, Kinsey, and Yisrael are also members of\r\n  the Coastal Conservation League, a non-profit environmental organization.\r\nRespondents moved for summary\r\n  judgment, asserting the Private Party Appellants lacked standing.Â  Before the\r\n  circuit court ruled on the motion for summary judgment, the Stateâ€”through the\r\n  Attorney Generalâ€”moved on July 16, 2007 to intervene.Â  The State then filed an\r\n  alternative motion on October 1, 2007 to be substituted as the real party in interest.\r\nThe circuit court granted Respondents'\r\n  motion for summary judgment and declined to reach the merits of the annexation\r\n  challenge.Â  The court denied the State's motions.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nThe construction of\r\n  a statute is a question of law, which this Court may resolve without deference\r\n  to the circuit court.Â  Catawba Indian Tribe of S.C. v. State, 372 S.C.\r\n  519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007) (&quot;The issue of interpretation of a\r\n  statute is a question of law for the court.Â  We are free to decide a question\r\n  of law with no particular deference to the circuit court.&quot; (internal\r\n  citation omitted)).\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Code Title Five, Chapter Three, sets forth various methods that a\r\n  municipality may use to extend its corporate limits.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-10\r\n  (2004).Â  Two methods of annexation are at issue here.Â  First, the &quot;100%\r\n  petition method&quot; allows a municipality to annex property upon the\r\n  signature of all persons who own real estate in the annexed area.Â  The\r\n  requirements of this method are set forth at South Carolina Code section\r\n  5-3-150(3) (2004):\r\n\r\n\tNotwithstanding\r\n  the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, any area or property\r\n  which is contiguous to a municipality may be annexed to the municipality by\r\n  filing with the municipal governing body a petition signed by all persons\r\n  owning real estate in the area requesting annexation. Â Upon the agreement of\r\n  the governing body to accept the petition and annex the area, and the enactment\r\n  of an ordinance declaring the area annexed to the municipality, the annexation\r\n  is complete. . . . This method of annexation is in addition to any other\r\n  methods authorized by law.\r\n\r\nSecond,\r\n  the &quot;75% petition method&quot; permits a municipality to proceed with\r\n  annexation with the consent of less than all of the property owners.Â  The\r\n  requirements of this method are set forth at South Carolina Code section\r\n  5-3-150(1):\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAny area\r\n  or property which is contiguous to a municipality may be annexed to the\r\n  municipality by filing with the municipal governing body a petition signed by\r\n  seventy-five percent or more of the freeholders, as defined in Section 5-3-240,\r\n  owning at least seventy-five percent of the assessed valuation of the real\r\n  property in the area requesting annexation. Â Upon the agreement of the\r\n  governing body to accept the petition and annex the area, and the enactment of\r\n  an ordinance declaring the area annexed to the municipality, the annexation is\r\n  complete. . . . This method of annexation is in addition to any other methods\r\n  authorized by law; however, this property may not be annexed unless the\r\n  following has been complied with: . . . (5) the municipality or any resident of\r\n  it and any person residing in the area to be annexed or owning real property of\r\n  it may institute and maintain a suit in the court of common pleas, and in that\r\n  suit the person may challenge and have adjudicated any issue raised in\r\n  connection with the proposed or completed annexation; (6) not less than thirty\r\n  days before acting on an annexation petition, the annexing municipality must\r\n  give notice of a public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general\r\n  circulation in the community, by posting the notice of the public hearing on\r\n  the municipal bulletin board, and by written notification to the taxpayer of\r\n  record of all properties within the area proposed to be annexed, to the chief\r\n  administrative officer of the county, to all public service or special purpose\r\n  districts, and all fire departments, whether volunteer or full time.Â  This\r\n  public hearing must include a map of the proposed annexation area, a complete\r\n  legal description of the proposed annexation area, a statement as to what\r\n  public services are to be assumed or provided by the municipality, and the\r\n  taxes and fees required for these services.Â  The notice must include a\r\n  projected timetable for the provision or assumption of these services.\r\n\r\nThe 75% petition\r\n  method provides greater notice and opportunity to challenge than the 100%\r\n  petition method.Â  The 100% petition method provides neither an express notice\r\n  provision nor an authorization for third parties to challenge the annexation.Â \r\n  The absence of such provisions in the 100% petition method is readily\r\n  understood in light of the requirement that all property owners in the\r\n  annexed area consent by signing the annexation petition.Â  Notably, residents of\r\n  the annexing municipality are not permitted to challenge a 100% petition\r\n  annexation.Â  Rather, &quot;[i]n order to challenge a 100% annexation, the\r\n  challenger must assert an infringement of its own proprietary interests or\r\n  statutory rights.&quot;Â  St. Andrews Public Service District v. City Council\r\n    of Charleston, 349 S.C. 602, 604, 564 S.E.2d 647, 648 (2002) (citing State\r\n      by State Budget and Control Bd. v. City of Columbia, 308 S.C. 487, 489, 419\r\n  S.E.2d 229, 230 (1992)).Â  In sum, the 100% petition method is a &quot;fast\r\n  track&quot; for annexation that may be used only when all of the property\r\n  owners consent.\r\nThe\r\n  State holds presumptive title to all land below the high water mark, including\r\n  marshland, in trust for the benefit of the citizens of this State.Â  McQueen\r\n    v. S.C. Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142, 149-50, 580 S.E.2d 116, 119-20\r\n  (2003); see State v. Holston Land Co., 272 S.C. 65, 67-68, 248 S.E.2d\r\n  922, 923-24 (1978) (finding the term &quot;marsh land&quot; in a conveyance\r\n  from the King sufficient to overcome the State's presumptive title to land\r\n  below the high water mark).Â  Thus, the State is the presumptive owner of the\r\n  marshlands that were annexed in this case.\r\nIII.\r\nA. Private Party\r\n  Appellants\r\nThe Private Party Appellants advanced several theories\r\n  in support of their standing to challenge this annexation.Â  We hold the circuit\r\n  court properly rejected each theory.Â  In doing so, we adhere to our existing\r\n  precedent regarding standing to challenge 100% petition annexations.Â  See St. Andrews Public Service District, 349 S.C. at 604, 564 S.E.2d at 648.\r\n\r\n1. Standing as a Resident\r\n  of Yemassee\r\nThe\r\n  annexation ordinance at issue recites that annexation was achieved pursuant to section\r\n  5-3-150(3), the 100% petition method.Â  The Private Party Appellants argue that,\r\n  because the State is the presumptive owner of the annexed marshlands and the\r\n  State did not sign the petition, the annexation was not proper under the 100%\r\n  petition method.Â  On this premise, Appellants contend the annexation was\r\n  actually achieved by 75% petition.Â  If the annexation was by 75% petition,\r\n  Appellant Yisrael had standing to bring his challenge.[3]Â \r\n  Â§ 5-3-150(1)(5) (&quot;[T]he municipality or any resident of it . . . may\r\n  institute and maintain a suit in the court of common pleas, and in that suit\r\n  the person may challenge and have adjudicated any issue raised in connection\r\n  with the proposed or completed annexation.&quot;).\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found the State's signature was not required for the 100% petition annexation,\r\n  and therefore, Mr. Yisrael did not have standing under the 75% petition\r\n  method.Â  While we disagree with the circuit court's interpretation of the statute,\r\n  we can only reach that question if presented by a party with standing.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., ATC South, Inc. v. Charleston County, 380 S.C. 191, 194-95,\r\n  669 S.E.2d 337, 339 (2008) (&quot;We are obligated before reaching the merits\r\n  of the rezoning question to determine whether ATC has standing to press its\r\n  complaint.&quot;); Joytime Distribs. and Amusement Co. v. State, 338\r\n  S.C. 634, 639, 528 S.E.2d 647, 649 (1999) (&quot;Standing to sue is a\r\n  fundamental requirement in instituting an action.&quot;).Â  We reject the\r\n  suggestion that the perceived merits of the underlying claim may influence the\r\n  standing determination.Â  This basic principle defeats the Private Party\r\n  Appellants' claim.\r\nThe\r\n  ordinance recites that the annexation was achieved using the 100% petition\r\n  method.Â  If we went behind that assertion without a proper plaintiff, we would\r\n  be inviting a sliding scale for standing: the more meritorious a claim appears,\r\n  the more relaxed the standing requirement would be.Â  We rejected such reasoning\r\n  when we overruled Quinn v. City of Columbia.[4]Â  See St. Andrews Public Service District, 349 S.C. at 605, 564 S.E.2d at\r\n  648 (overruling the Quinn rule that a stranger to an annexation may\r\n  challenge the annexation if the ordinance is &quot;absolutely void&quot;).Â \r\n  Adhering to our precedent, we must determine standing without regard to the\r\n  merits of the underlying claim.Â  Accordingly, we cannot use the alleged flaws\r\n  in the 100% petition to find standing pursuant to the 75% petition method.\r\n2. Public Trust Doctrine\r\nThe\r\n  Private Party Appellants assert that, because the State holds title to the\r\n  annexed marshlands in trust for the benefit of the residents and citizens of\r\n  South Carolina, Appellants (as citizens) are equitable owners of these\r\n  properties.Â  Appellants argue this equitable ownership is a proprietary\r\n  interest sufficient to create standing to challenge an annexation by 100%\r\n  petition.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellants'\r\n  position in this regard is at odds with our holding in St. Andrews Public\r\n    Service District.Â  Under Appellants' position, every member of the public\r\n  would have standing, even though our precedent states that standing to\r\n  challenge annexations by 100% petition is limited.Â  We adhere to our precedent\r\n  and reject this argument.\r\n3. Other Theories for\r\n  Standing\r\nThe Private Party\r\n  Appellants have advanced several additional theories in support of their\r\n  standing.Â  First, they argue Appellants Campbell and Kinsey have standing to\r\n  challenge the annexation pursuant to a statuteâ€”South Carolina Code section\r\n  6-29-760(C) (2004)â€”that grants the owners of adjoining land standing to\r\n  challenge zoning changes.Â  This statute is inapplicable because this lawsuit\r\n  challenges annexation, not zoning.\r\nSecond,\r\n  the Private Party Appellants argue they will suffer an individualized injury\r\n  sufficient to support standing because they personally enjoy &quot;the nature\r\n  views and wildlife&quot; on the annexed property and their enjoyment would be\r\n  harmed by the development of the property into commercial and residential\r\n  units.Â  This alleged harm is shared by all, and like Appellants' public trust\r\n  claim, this argument, if accepted, would effectively overrule our decision in St.\r\n    Andrews Public Service District.\r\nFinally, the\r\n  Private Party Appellants argue that if they do not have standing under section\r\n  5-3-150(3), this denial of standing violates their due process and equal\r\n  protection rights under the South Carolina Constitution.Â  We have carefully\r\n  reviewed these claims and find them to be manifestly without merit.Â  We affirm\r\n  the circuit court's decision on these issues pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR\r\n  and the following authorities: Lee v. S.C. Dep't of Natural Res., 339\r\n  S.C. 463, 467, 470 n.4, 530 S.E.2d 112, 114-15 (2000) (setting forth the test\r\n  for rational basis review of an equal protection claim and explaining that\r\n  &quot;[a] legislative enactment will be sustained against constitutional attack\r\n  if there is 'any reasonable hypothesis' to support it,&quot; even if the hypothesis\r\n  does not represent the &quot;actual motivations of the enacting governmental\r\n  body&quot;); Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (requiring every issue raised in an\r\n  appellant's brief to be &quot;followed by discussion and citations of\r\n  authority&quot;).\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we hold the circuit court properly rejected each of the Private Party\r\n  Appellants' arguments in support of standing.Â  An annexation by 100% petition\r\n  may be challenged only by a person who &quot;assert[s] an infringement of [his\r\n  or her] own proprietary interests or statutory rights.&quot; St. Andrews Public\r\n    Service District, 349 S.C. at 604, 564 S.E.2d at 648.\r\n\r\nB. State's Motions to\r\n  Intervene or be Substituted\r\nas the Real Party in\r\n  Interest\r\nFifteen\r\n  months after the annexation ordinance was adopted, and while Respondents'\r\n  motion for summary judgment was pending, the State moved to intervene in the\r\n  annexation challenge.Â  The State then filed an alternative motion to be\r\n  substituted as the real party in interest in the Private Party Appellants'\r\n  case.Â  The circuit court found both motions were untimely.Â  While we disagree\r\n  with the circuit court's reasoning as it pertains to the interpretation of\r\n  section 5-3-150(3), we affirm the circuit court's determination that the\r\n  State's effort to intervene was barred by the statute of limitations.\r\n1. The State as an Owner of Real Estate within the Meaning\r\n  of Section 5-3-150(3)\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found the phrase &quot;persons owning real estate,&quot; as used\r\n  in the 100% petition method, is synonymous with the word &quot;freeholder&quot;\r\n  in the 75% petition method.Â  &quot;Freeholder&quot; is defined as:\r\n\r\n\t[A]ny\r\n  person eighteen years of age, or older, and any firm or corporation, who or\r\n  which owns legal title to a present possessory interest in real estate equal to\r\n  a life estate or greater . . . and who owns, at the date of the petition or of\r\n  the referendum, at least an undivided one-tenth interest in a single tract and\r\n  whose name appears on the county tax records as an owner of real estate.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 5-3-240. Â Because the State\r\n  was not listed on the county tax rolls as an owner of the annexed property, the\r\n  circuit court found the State was not a freeholder.Â  Accordingly, the circuit\r\n  court found the State's signature was not required for the 100% petition\r\n  annexation.Â  We reject this position.\r\nWhere\r\n  the State holds title to real property in the area to be annexed, it is a &quot;person[]\r\n  owning real estate&quot; within the meaning of section 5-3-150(3) and its\r\n  signature is required to accomplish an annexation by 100% petition.\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  5-3-150(3) provides in relevant part:\r\n\t[A]ny\r\n  area or property which is contiguous to a municipality may be annexed to the\r\n  municipality by filing with the municipal governing body a petition signed\r\n    by all persons owning real estate in the area requesting annexation.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  By its plain\r\n  language, section 5-3-150(3) requires the signatures of &quot;all persons\r\n  owning real estate in the area requesting annexation.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  term &quot;freeholder&quot; is not included in subsection (3), and we decline\r\n  Respondents' invitation to read it in.Â  The phrase &quot;all persons owning\r\n  real estate,&quot; as it is commonly understood, does not carry with it the\r\n  various requirements of &quot;freeholder&quot; status.Â  See Bryant v.\r\n    City of Charleston, 295 S.C. 408, 411, 368 S.E.2d 899, 900-01 (1988)\r\n  (&quot;[I]n construing a statute its words must be given their plain and\r\n  ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or\r\n  expand the statute's operation.&quot;).Â  We must respect the General Assembly's\r\n  use of distinct terms to describe the signatories required for 100% petition\r\n  versus 75% petition method annexations.Â  See U.S. v. Barial, 31 F.3d\r\n  216, 218 (4th Cir. 1994) (&quot;Where Congress has chosen different language in\r\n  proximate subsections of the same statute, courts are obligated to give that\r\n  choice effect.&quot;).Â  For these reasons, we find the circuit court's\r\n  interpretation of section 5-3-150(3) was an error of law.[5]\r\nFurther,\r\n  while section 5-3-150(3) does not explicitly require notice to each property\r\n  owner, it is self-evident that each property owner who signs the\r\n  petition has notice of the petition.Â  See Kiriakides v. United\r\n    Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)\r\n  (&quot;All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the\r\n  legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the\r\n  language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended\r\n  purpose of the statute.&quot;).Â  The petition itself provides notice.Â  Thus,\r\n  the Town was required to present the petition to the State for signature.\r\nThis\r\n  annexation did not comply with the requirements of the 100% petition method.Â \r\n  The State was the presumptive owner of the annexed marshlands and the Town did\r\n  not provide the State with prior notice of the annexation or obtain the State's\r\n  signature on the petition.[6]Â  Nevertheless, the\r\n  State's challenge to the annexation is time-barred.\r\n\r\n2. State's Motions were\r\n  Untimely\r\n\r\n\tSouth\r\n  Carolina Code section 5-3-270 (2004) provides:\r\n\tWhen the\r\n  limits of a municipality are ordered extended, no contest thereabout shall be\r\n  allowed unless the person interested therein files, within sixty days after the\r\n  result has been published or declared, with both the clerk of the municipality\r\n  and the clerk of court of the county in which the municipality is located, a\r\n  notice of his intention to contest the extension, nor unless, within ninety\r\n  days from the time the result has been published or declared an action is begun\r\n  and the original summons and complaint filed with the clerk of court of the\r\n  county in which the municipality is located.\r\n\r\nHere, the ordinance\r\n  was adopted on April 25, 2006, after two readings by the Town Council.Â  Section\r\n  5-3-270 clearly provides that the limitation period runs from the publication\r\n  or declaration of the result of the annexation.Â  Thus, though the Attorney\r\n  General asserts the State did not learn of the annexation until July 2, 2007,\r\n  the State's motionsâ€”which were filed on July 16, 2007 and October 1, 2007â€”were\r\n  untimely.Â  In essence, the State requests that the Court create a\r\n  &quot;discovery rule&quot; for purposes of the section 5-3-270 limitations\r\n  period.Â  We decline to do so under the facts presented.[7]Â \r\n  On balance, while we recognize the State's lack of actual notice of the\r\n  annexation, we assign greater importance to the policy of finality of an\r\n  annexation, with its attendant consequences.Â  We believe this policy is\r\n  reflected in the abbreviated statute of limitations in section 5-3-270.Â  See State ex rel. Condon v. City of Columbia, 339 S.C. 8, 16-21, 528 S.E.2d\r\n  408, 412-14 (2000) (holding the State is subject to the statute of limitations\r\n  when bringing a quo warranto action to challenge an annexation); Hite\r\n    v. Town of West Columbia, 220 S.C. 59, 64-66, 66 S.E.2d 427, 429-30 (1951)\r\n  (holding the sixty-day limit on notice of intent to contest an annexation and\r\n  ninety-day limit on filing a challenge are not &quot;unreasonable and\r\n  arbitrary&quot; and are not a denial of due process).\r\nThe\r\n  State argues, however, that its motions should &quot;relate back&quot; to the\r\n  timely action by the Private Party Appellants.Â  We have carefully reviewed the\r\n  record and find that, under the circumstances of this case, the circuit court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion in denying the State's motions.Â  See Intown\r\n    Properties Mgmt., Inc. v. Wheaton Van Lines, Inc., 271 F.3d 164, 168 (4th\r\n  Cir. 2001) (&quot;Thus, assuming that Intown is the real party in interest in\r\n  the Transcontinental action, with standing and claims that have not been\r\n  waived, we consider whether the district court abused its discretion in\r\n  refusing to permit Intown to join its insurer's suit as a party plaintiff, not\r\n  by intervening under Rule 24, but by a combination of Rules 15 and 17[, Fed. R.\r\n  Civ. P.]&quot;); Berkeley Electric Coop., Inc. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,\r\n  302 S.C. 186, 189, 394 S.E.2d 712, 714 (1990) (&quot;In reviewing the granting\r\n  or denial of a Rule 24(a)(2) motion, we must determine whether the trial judge\r\n  abused his discretion.&quot;).\r\nIV.\r\nIn conclusion, we hold the circuit court properly\r\n  rejected the Private Party Appellants' attempts to establish standing.Â  We made\r\n  clear in St. Andrews Public Service District that a party seeking to\r\n  challenge a 100% petition annexation &quot;must assert an infringement of its\r\n  own proprietary interests or statutory rights.&quot;Â  The Private Party\r\n  Appellants lacked standing, and the circuit court properly dismissed their\r\n  challenge.\r\nWe further hold the circuit court properly determined\r\n  that the State's annexation challenge was untimely.Â  We conclude, however, that\r\n  the circuit court erred in finding the State's signature was not required for\r\n  an annexation by 100% petition.Â  As a property owner, the State's signature was\r\n  required on the 100% petition.Â  A town or municipality may not undertake a\r\n  &quot;fast track&quot; annexation without a petition signed by &quot;all\r\n  persons owning real estate in the area requesting annexation.&quot;\r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  \r\nI\r\n  agree with the majority's finding that the circuit court properly rejected the\r\n  Private Party Appellants' theories in support of their standing to challenge\r\n  the annexation.Â  I also agree with the majority's finding that the Town was\r\n  required to obtain the State's signature on the petition.Â  I respectfully\r\n  disagree, however, with the majority's finding that the State's motion to\r\n  intervene was untimely.\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the granting or denial of a Rule 24, SCRCP, motion, the Supreme Court\r\n  must determine whether the trial judge abused his or her discretion.Â  Berkeley\r\n    Electric Coop., Inc. v. Mt. Pleasant, 302 S.C. 186, 394 S.E.2d 712 (1990).\r\nPursuant\r\n  to Rule 24, SCRCP, a party may intervene only upon timely application.Â  Our\r\n  courts have adopted a four-part test for determining timeliness:Â  (1) the time\r\n  that has passed since the applicant knew or should have known of his or her\r\n  interest in the suit; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the stage to which the\r\n  litigation has progressed; (4) the prejudice the original parties would suffer\r\n  from granting intervention and the applicant would suffer from denial.Â  Ex parte\r\n    Reichlyn, 310 S.C. 495, 500, 427 S.E.2d 661, 664 (1993); see also Davis v. Jennings, 304 S.C. 502, 505, 405 S.E.2d 601, 603 (1991).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found the State's action could not relate back to the date of the\r\n  Private Party Appellants' filing because the Private Party Appellants lacked\r\n  standing.Â  Specifically, the circuit court found it &quot;had no jurisdiction\r\n  to begin with,&quot; and that the State could not create jurisdiction after the\r\n  statute of limitations had run.Â  I would find the circuit court erred in\r\n  making this finding because a party's lack of standing as a real party in\r\n  interest does not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See Bardoon Props., NV v. Eidolon, 326 S.C. 166, 485 S.E.2d 371 (1997).\r\nFurther,\r\n  the circuit court failed to exercise its discretion by not applying the\r\n  four-part test to determine whether the motion was timely.Â  See Callen\r\n    v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 627, 620 S.E.2d 59, 64 (2005) (&quot;When the\r\n  trial judge is vested with discretion, but his ruling reveals no discretion\r\n  was, in fact, exercised, an error of law has occurred.&quot;) (quoting Fontaine\r\n    v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987)).Â  I would thus\r\n  remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to apply the four-part\r\n  test.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Binden Plantation consists of approximately 1300 acres of property\r\n  located in Beaufort County, directly across the intersection of U.S. Highways\r\n  17 and 21 from Castle Hill Farms.Â  Respondent Raymond P. Basso is the president\r\n  of Castle Hill Farms.\r\n[2]&nbsp; &quot;Freeholder&quot; is a term of art defined by South Carolina Code\r\n  section 5-3-240 (2004).Â  This definition is set forth below in Section III.B.1.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The Private Party Appellants challenge the annexation on the grounds\r\n  that (1) the Town failed to obtain the consent of the Department of\r\n  Transportation prior to annexing the portion of U.S. Highway 17 that lies\r\n  between Castle Hill Farms and Binden Plantation; and (2) the annexation is not\r\n  contiguous.Â  Because we find Appellants lack standing, we do not reach the merits\r\n  of these challenges.\r\n[4]&nbsp; 303 S.C. 405, 401\r\n  S.E.2d 165 (1991).\r\n[5]&nbsp; The circuit court asserted that an\r\n  interpretation giving meaning to the difference in terms would have an absurd\r\n  result.Â  It reasoned that section 5-3-150(4) defines the lessee in a fee in\r\n  lieu of taxes agreement as a freeholder, and therefore, a construction that\r\n  gave effect to the difference in terms would mean the lessee could sign an\r\n  annexation petition under the 75% petition method but not under the 100%\r\n  petition method.Â  We decline to speculate about the General Assembly's reasons\r\n  for choosing to define the lessee as a freeholder.Â  The truly absurd result\r\n  would be to construe the statute to allow a landowner's property to be annexed\r\n  without his consent where the annexation purports to have been achieved by a\r\n  petition of 100% of the landowners.\r\n[6]&nbsp; We reject Respondents' argument that the notice provided to the\r\n  Secretary of State, Department of Transportation, and Department of Public\r\n  Safety pursuant to South Carolina Code section 5-3-90 (2004) satisfied the\r\n  requirements of the 100% petition method.Â  This notice is given after the\r\n  annexation is complete and serves to advise the agencies of the &quot;new\r\n  boundaries&quot; of the municipality.Â  It gives the agencies notice of a\r\n  completed act; it does not satisfy the requirement that an annexing\r\n  municipality receive consent from all property owners before proceeding\r\n  under the 100% petition method.\r\n[7]&nbsp; There is no evidence of a nefarious motive on the part of the Town in\r\n  not seeking the State's consent to the annexation.Â  This is a novel issue, and\r\n  it is clear that the Town, like the circuit court, believed the State's\r\n  signature was not required for an annexation pursuant to section 5-3-150(3).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26939","title":"In the Matter of William Gary White, III","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26939","description":"In this attorney disciplinary matter, we impose a definite suspension of ninety days on attorney William Gary White III for his lack of civility and professionalism while handling a zoning dispute with the Town of Atlantic Beach.","date":"2011-03-07","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of William Gary White, III, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26939\r\nHeard February 1, 2011 - Filed March 7,\r\n  2011\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M.\r\n  Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam Gary White, III, of Columbia, South Carolina, pro\r\n\t\t\t\tse Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this attorney\r\n  disciplinary matter, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (&quot;Commission&quot;)\r\n  investigated allegations of misconduct involving the Respondent, William Gary\r\n  White, III, for his lack of civility and professionalism while handling a\r\n  zoning dispute with the Town of Atlantic Beach (&quot;Town&quot;).Â  The Office\r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) filed formal charges against Respondent,\r\n  and a Hearing Panel of the Commission recommended a definite suspension.Â  We find\r\n  Respondent has committed misconduct that warrants imposition of a definite\r\n  suspension of ninety days and order Respondent to complete the Legal Ethics and\r\n  Practice Program administered by the South Carolina Bar within six months of reinstatement.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nIn 2004, Respondent\r\n  represented the Atlantic Beach Christian Methodist Episcopal Church[1] (&quot;Church&quot;) in a legal action it filed against the Town regarding a\r\n  zoning dispute.Â  The Town Attorney was Charles Boykin.Â  The parties settled the\r\n  action in 2007.Â  As part of the settlement, the Church's action was dismissed,\r\n  the Town paid damages to the Church, and the Church promised future compliance\r\n  with all of the Town's building, permitting, and zoning requirements.Â  \r\nOn April 30, 2009,\r\n  Kenneth McIver, the new Town Manager, sent a notice about the need for zoning\r\n  compliance to the owners of the Church property, Vonetta M. Nimocks and Eboni\r\n  A. McClary (&quot;Church's Landlords&quot;).Â  In his notice, McIver stated that\r\n  as part of the prior settlement, &quot;the judge ordered that the Church must\r\n  comply with the Town's Zoning Ordinances and that a request for compliance must\r\n  come from you, the owner[s].&quot;Â  McIver copied the notice to the Church's\r\n  pastor, who gave it to Respondent.Â  Â Â \r\nOn May 6, 2009,\r\n  Respondent sent a letter about McIver's notice to the Church's Landlords.Â  Respondent\r\n  sent copies of his letter to McIver and Boykin.Â  The remarks made by Respondent\r\n  in his May 6th letter are the subject of this disciplinary proceeding.Â  The\r\n  letter reads in full as follows:\r\n\r\n\tYou\r\n  have been sent a letter by purported Town Manager Kenneth McIver.Â  The letter\r\n  is false.Â  You notice McIver has no Order.Â  He also has no brains and it is\r\n  questionable if he has a soul.Â  Christ was crucified some 2000 years ago.Â  The\r\n  church is His body on earth.Â  The pagans at Atlantic Beach want to crucify His\r\n  body here on earth yet again.\r\n\tWe\r\n  will continue to defend you against the Town's insane [sic].Â  As they continue\r\n  to have to pay for damages they pigheadedly cause the church.Â  You will also be\r\n  entitled to damages if you want to pursue them.\r\n\tFirst\r\n  graders know about freedom of religion.Â  The pagans of Atlantic Beach think\r\n  they are above God and the Federal law.Â  They do not seem to be able to learn.Â \r\n  People like them in S.C. tried to defy Federal law before with similar lack of\r\n  success.\r\n\r\nMcIver delivered\r\n  the letter to the Town Council, and three council members thereafter filed a\r\n  disciplinary complaint against Respondent.Â  ODC instituted formal charges\r\n  against Respondent as a result of his conduct.\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing on June 8, 2010, counsel for ODC stated:Â  &quot;ODC alleges that\r\n  [Respondent's] statements questioning whether Mr. McIver has a soul, saying\r\n  that he has no brain, calling the leadership of the Town pagans and insane and\r\n  pigheaded violates his professional obligations, which include his obligation\r\n  to provide competent representation to his clients; his obligation under Rule\r\n  4.4 to treat third parties in a way that doesn't embarrass them; Rule 8.4 to\r\n  behave in a way that doesn't prejudice the administration of justice; and also []\r\n  the letter was not in conformity with his obligations under his oath of office,\r\n  Rule 402(k).&quot;[2]Â \r\n  Counsel for ODC further alleged that Respondent had failed to cooperate with\r\n  disciplinary authority by refusing to answer the allegations against him, threatening\r\n  to sue the complainants for filing the grievance, and questioning ODC's authority.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Hearing Panel found that Respondent was subject to discipline under Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, for violating the following Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) of Rule\r\n  407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (competence), Rule 4.4 (respect for the rights of third\r\n  persons), Rule 8.1 (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand from a\r\n  disciplinary authority), and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to\r\n  the administration of justice).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Hearing Panel further found Respondent is subject to discipline for violating\r\n  the following provisions of the RLDE contained in Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule\r\n  7(a)(3), RLDE (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand from a\r\n  disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5), RLDE (engaging in conduct tending to\r\n  pollute the administration of justice, tending to bring the legal profession\r\n  into disrepute, and demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule\r\n  7(a)(6), RLDE (violating the Lawyer's Oath taken upon the admission to practice\r\n  law in South Carolina).Â  \r\nThe Hearing Panel found three aggravating\r\n  circumstances:Â  Respondent's lack of remorse and unwillingness to acknowledge\r\n  his wrongdoing, his extensive disciplinary history, and his &quot;disregard and\r\n  disrespect for these proceedings.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  Hearing Panel stated &quot;Respondent offered no evidence in mitigation,&quot;\r\n  but noted he did call his wife as a witness, who testified that she suffers\r\n  from cancer.Â  The Hearing Panel stated Respondent offered no evidence that his\r\n  wife's condition impacted his conduct in any way and, further, Respondent's\r\n  wife was not diagnosed until after he sent the May 6, 2009 letter, so the\r\n  Hearing Panel did &quot;not consider Respondent's wife's medical condition as a\r\n  mitigating factor.&quot;Â  \r\nThe Hearing Panel recommended that Respondent be\r\n  suspended from the practice of law.Â  Three members of the Hearing Panel\r\n  recommended a one-year suspension; one member recommended a two-year suspension.Â \r\n  The Hearing Panel recommended that Respondent be required to pay a fine and the\r\n  costs of these proceedings.Â  It also recommended that Respondent be ordered to\r\n  complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program administered by the South\r\n  Carolina Bar as a condition of reinstatement.\r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRespondent has filed a brief opposing the Hearing\r\n  Panel's recommended discipline, and ODC has filed a brief in support of the\r\n  recommendations.\r\n&quot;The authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in\r\n  which the discipline is given rests entirely with this\r\n  Court.&quot;Â  In re Tullis, 375 S.C. 190, 191, 652 S.E.2d 395,\r\n  395&nbsp;(2007).Â  The Court &quot;has the sole authority . . . to decide the\r\n  appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record.&quot;Â  In re\r\n    Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  &quot;The Court is\r\n  not bound by the panel's recommendation and may make its own findings of fact\r\n  and conclusions of law.&quot;Â  In re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661\r\n  S.E.2d 102, 106&nbsp;(2008).Â  \r\nA\r\n  disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  In\r\n    re Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see also Rule 8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall\r\n  be established by clear and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the\r\n  charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.&quot;).\r\nA.&nbsp; Rule 4.4(a), Respect for Rights of Third Persons\r\nRule\r\n  4.4(a) of the RPC provides in relevant part:Â  &quot;In representing a client, a\r\n  lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to\r\n  embarrass, delay, or burden a third person . . . .&quot;Â  Rule 4.4(a), Rule\r\n  407, SCACR.\r\nRespondent\r\n  argues his letter served numerous purposes other than embarrassing others, such\r\n  as serving as a &quot;warning&quot; that he would sue the Town &quot;a fourth\r\n  time,&quot; protecting his and his client's religious beliefs, and protecting\r\n  the integrity of the courts.Â  We agree with ODC and the Hearing Panel that it\r\n  is clear Respondent's &quot;substantial purpose&quot; in making the remarks and\r\n  copying the letter to the Town Manager and the Town Attorney was to intimidate\r\n  and embarrass those he perceived as being contrary to his client's legal\r\n  position.\r\nRespondent\r\n  argues the rule contains its own &quot;safe harbor&quot; that protects\r\n  &quot;uncivil&quot; remarks when they serve other purposes.Â  However, the fact\r\n  that the letter could have served other purposes does not prevent his conduct\r\n  from being in violation of Rule 4.4(a).Â  See, e.g., In re Norfleet,\r\n  358 S.C. 39, 595 S.E.2d 243&nbsp;(2004) (finding an attorney who became angry\r\n  and spoke in a threatening manner to a school principal who refused to turn\r\n  over a student's file had violated Rule 4.4; the attorney was attempting to\r\n  obtain the file for the otherwise legitimate purpose of using it in\r\n  litigation).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  an attorney may not, as a means of gaining a strategic advantage, engage in\r\n  degrading and insulting conduct that departs from the standards of civility and\r\n  professionalism required of all attorneys.Â  See In re Golden, 329\r\n  S.C. 335, 341, 496 S.E.2d 619, 622&nbsp;(1998) (determining the attorney's\r\n  conduct in questioning a witness by using sarcasm, unnecessary combativeness,\r\n  threatening words, and intimidation served no legitimate purpose other than to\r\n  embarrass, delay, or burden another person and, even if the witness was being uncooperative,\r\n  it would not justify the attorney's insulting conduct, which was found to have &quot;completely\r\n  departed from the standards of our profession&quot; as well as &quot;basic\r\n  notions of decency and civility&quot;).\r\nIt\r\n  is clear from the record in this matter that Respondent sent the letter as a\r\n  calculated tactic to intimidate and insult his opponents.Â  Although Respondent\r\n  maintains he used many of the words at the request of his client, the Church,\r\n  Respondent cannot discharge his responsibility for his use of disparaging\r\n  name-calling and epithets by simply stating he was asked to behave in this\r\n  unprofessional manner by his client.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  has also justified his conduct by arguing that he has a duty to provide zealous\r\n  representation.Â  We agree that an attorney has an obligation to provide zealous\r\n  representation to a client.Â  However, an attorney also has a corresponding\r\n  obligation to opposing parties, the public, his profession, the courts, and\r\n  others to behave in a civilized and professional manner in discharging his\r\n  obligations to his client.Â  Legal disputes are often emotional and heated, and\r\n  it is precisely for this reason that attorneys must maintain a professional\r\n  demeanor while providing the necessary legal expertise to help resolve, not\r\n  escalate, such disputes.Â  Insulting and intimidating tactics serve only to\r\n  undermine the administration of justice and respect for the rule of law, which\r\n  ultimately does not serve the goals of the client or aid the resolution of\r\n  disputes.\r\nB.&nbsp; Constitutional Arguments \r\nTo\r\n  the extent Respondent argues the contents of his letter are protected by the\r\n  United States Constitution by the First Amendment provisions for freedom of\r\n  speech and freedom of religion, we conclude these rights do not prevent\r\n  disciplinary action for an attorney's misconduct that is violative of the\r\n  professional standards set by the courts.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  the United States, the courts have historically regulated admission to the\r\n  practice of law before them and exercised the authority to discipline and\r\n  ultimately to disbar lawyers whose conduct departed from prescribed\r\n  standards.&quot;Â  Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 1066\r\n  (1991). \r\n&quot;'Membership\r\n  in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions,' to use the oft-repeated\r\n  statement of Cardozo, J., in In re Rouss, 221 N.Y. 81, 84, 116 N.E. 782,\r\n  783 (1917), quoted in Theard v. United States, 354 U.S. 278, 281, 77\r\n  S.Ct. 1274, 1276, 1 L.Ed.2d 1342 (1957).&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;It is\r\n  unquestionable that in the courtroom itself, during a judicial proceeding,\r\n  whatever right to 'free speech' an attorney has is extremely\r\n  circumscribed.&quot;Â  Id. at 1071.Â  Limitations on the free speech\r\n  rights of attorneys are also recognized as to extrajudicial statements.Â  See id. at 1075-77.\r\n&quot;States\r\n  have a compelling interest in the practice of professions within their\r\n  boundaries, and . . . as part of their power to protect the public health,\r\n  safety, and other valid interests they have broad power to establish standards\r\n  for licensing practitioners and regulating the practice of professions.&quot;Â  Florida\r\n    Bar v. Went For It, Inc.,&nbsp;515 U.S. 618, 625 (1995) (quoting Goldfarb\r\n      v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 792 (1975) (alteration in original)). \r\n&quot;Although\r\n  a lawyer does not surrender her freedom of expression upon admission to the\r\n  bar, once admitted, a lawyer must temper her criticisms in accordance with\r\n  professional standards of conduct.&quot;Â  Burton v. Statewide Grievance\r\n    Committee, 830 A.2d 1205, 1211&nbsp;(Conn. Super. Ct. 2002) (citing United\r\n      States Dist. Court for the E. Dist. of Washington v. Sandlin, 12 F.3d 861,\r\n  866 (9th Cir. 1993)).Â  &quot;[T]here is a balancing of an attorney's right of\r\n  free speech and the state's interest in preserving the integrity of the\r\n  judicial system.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\nThe Hearing Panel's\r\n  determination that Respondent's conduct is not protected by the First Amendment\r\n  is supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Respondent could have zealously\r\n  protected his client's rights by means other than using derogatory and demeaning\r\n  comments.Â  The legal profession is one of advocacy; however, Respondent's role\r\n  as an advocate would have been better served by zealously arguing his client's legal\r\n  position, not making personal attacks.Â  His statement that the RPC are always\r\n  trumped by the First Amendment is not a correct statement of the law, and we\r\n  hold the Hearing Panel properly found his actions amounted to sanctionable\r\n  misconduct.\r\nC.&nbsp; Rule 8.1, Failure to Cooperate\r\nAs\r\n  to the Hearing Panel's finding that he violated the RPC by failing to cooperate\r\n  with lawful demands from a disciplinary authority, Respondent argues\r\n  &quot;[t]here is nothing in the record indicating any lack of cooperation,\r\n  simply that the Respondent was adamant about his client's rights and that they\r\n  were being violated.&quot;Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  filed answers when requested, essentially justifying his conduct as being protected\r\n  by the First Amendment, and he did file a witness list and an exhibit list and\r\n  respond to all other inquiries from ODC and participate in the hearing in this\r\n  matter.Â  Thus, although we find Respondent clearly committed misconduct in\r\n  other respects, we decline to find that he violated Rule 8.1 by failing to\r\n  cooperate.\r\nD.&nbsp; Mitigation\r\nAs\r\n  to Respondent's arguments regarding the failure of the Hearing Panel to find\r\n  his wife's health was a factor in mitigation, we find the record clearly\r\n  supports the Hearing Panel's finding.Â  Although his wife's diagnosis is\r\n  certainly unfortunate, the evidence indicates Respondent's letter of May 6,\r\n  2009 predates her diagnosis. Â Moreover, even if she had been diagnosed sooner, Respondent\r\n  failed to elicit any testimony on point as to how this affected his state of\r\n  mind or affected his ability to conform his conduct to the rules concerning\r\n  professional conduct.Â  \r\nIII.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nAfter\r\n  considering the record in this matter, we conclude Respondent has committed\r\n  misconduct in the respects identified by the Hearing Panel, except for the\r\n  allegation regarding the failure to cooperate.Â  We further find the Hearing\r\n  Panel's suggestion of a definite suspension is appropriate under the\r\n  circumstances.\r\nBased\r\n  on Respondent's blatant incivility and lack of decorum in this instance and the\r\n  aggravating factors found by the Hearing Panel, including his disciplinary\r\n  history, we impose a definite suspension of ninety days.Â  We further order\r\n  Respondent to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program administered by\r\n  the South Carolina Bar within six months of reinstatement.[3]Â \r\n  Respondent's conduct in this matter reflects poorly on himself as a member of\r\n  the legal profession and reflects negatively upon the profession as a whole.Â \r\n  He represented to this Court at oral argument that in the future he will\r\n  conduct himself in accordance with the RPC and treat all persons in a civil,\r\n  dignified, and professional manner as is expected of all members of the South\r\n  Carolina Bar.Â  We expect nothing less.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  It also appears in the record as the Christian\r\n  Methodist Episcopal Mission Church. \r\n[2]Â  Rule 402(k)(3), SCACR provides every applicant for\r\n  admission to practice law in this state must take and subscribe to the\r\n  &quot;Lawyer's Oath,&quot; by which the applicant pledges to act with &quot;fairness,\r\n  integrity, and civility, not only in court, but also in all written and oral\r\n  communications.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n[3]Â  We decline the recommendation of the Hearing Panel\r\n  to impose a fine or costs.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26940","title":"State v.

Parker, 381 S.C. 539, 673 S.E.2d\r\n  833&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) affirming the trial court's decision to deny a motion\r\n  to dismiss based on double jeopardy.Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIt is undisputed that\r\n  Petitioner shot and killed his sister's boyfriend, Robert Lee Stewart\r\n  (Victim).Â  In October 2003, Petitioner stood trial for murder.Â  At trial,\r\n  Petitioner claimed self-defense.Â  The first trial ended when the judge granted\r\n  Petitioner's motion for a mistrial.Â  When Petitioner was tried again in 2005,\r\n  he moved to dismiss based on double jeopardy.Â  The circuit court judge at the\r\n  second trial denied the motion and the jury convicted Petitioner of murder.\r\nDuring the first trial, there\r\n  was a great deal of animosity between the solicitor and defense counsel.Â  Prior\r\n  to questioning the first police witness, the solicitor explained that there was\r\n  a videotape made of the crime scene that included graphic images of Victim's\r\n  body.Â  The solicitor redacted the original videotape to erase the graphic\r\n  images and presented defense counsel a redacted copy on the day of trial.Â \r\n  However, the original videotape, including the graphic images of Victim's body,\r\n  was shown to the jury.Â  Petitioner's counsel moved for a mistrial and dismissal\r\n  with prejudice based on prosecutorial misconduct.Â  Counsel for defense argued\r\n  the solicitor's case was not going well and the State was now privy to his\r\n  defense tactics.Â  The solicitor claimed the tapes were switched unintentionally\r\n  and inadvertently.Â  The court found the explanation offered by the State\r\n  &quot;shocking&quot; as to why &quot;such a huge, substantial, material piece\r\n  of evidence would be handled in such carefree fashion . . . .&quot;Â  The\r\n  circuit court judge admonished the solicitor, but denied the motion for a\r\n  mistrial issuing a curative instruction that the jury was to disregard the fact\r\n  that they viewed the body of Victim. \r\nDuring the solicitor's\r\n  closing argument, she accused defense counsel of unethical conduct in coaching\r\n  witnesses and implied to the jury that it was their community duty to convict\r\n  Petitioner of murder.Â  After the solicitor concluded her closing argument,\r\n  defense counsel again made a motion for a mistrial.Â  Defense counsel contended\r\n  a mistrial should be granted based on prosecutorial misconduct in closing\r\n  argument in that the prosecution accused defense counsel of coaching witnesses,\r\n  and argued facts not in evidence.Â  Defense counsel ultimately argued that the\r\n  cumulative effect of the prosecutorial misconduct warranted a mistrial.Â  The\r\n  circuit court judge charged the jury and then heard arguments on the mistrial\r\n  motion.Â  The solicitor contended her closing argument was justified by the\r\n  evidence and was responsive to the defense's closing argument, thus, the\r\n  mistrial motion should be denied.Â  The jury then sent a note to the judge that\r\n  it was deadlocked.Â  The judge gave an Allen charge and the jury resumed\r\n  deliberating.Â  After further deliberation, the jury again reported that it was\r\n  deadlocked.Â  The judge received the note that the jury remained deadlocked as\r\n  he was about to rule on the mistrial motion.Â  \r\nThe circuit court judge noted\r\n  he had reviewed the motion for a mistrial, the solicitor's closing argument,\r\n  and his notes from the testimony.Â  The judge found the statements made about\r\n  Petitioner's counsel, the exhortation to the jury to convict in order to\r\n  protect the community, and the introduction of the original videotape warranted\r\n  a mistrial.Â  \r\nThe circuit court judge\r\n  stated, &quot;In my readings of those opinions it's almost as if . . . this\r\n  court can infer that the defendant was almost goaded into the position of\r\n  asking for a mistrial.Â  So based on the totality of the circumstances that\r\n  [have] occurred in this trial . . . I will declare a mistrial . . . .&quot;Â \r\n  The solicitor asked if the mistrial was based specifically on prosecutorial\r\n  misconduct or the comments in her closing argument.Â  The judge responded,\r\n  &quot;The comments made in closing arguments, I would consider to be\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct as well as . . . the video tape. . . . It's the\r\n  cumulative nature of everything.&quot;Â  The State appealed the grant of a\r\n  mistrial and the court of appeals dismissed the case as not immediately\r\n  appealable.\r\nAlmost two years later, the\r\n  State retried Petitioner.Â  Petitioner moved to dismiss based on double jeopardy\r\n  arguing the solicitor at the first trial intentionally goaded him into moving\r\n  for a mistrial.Â  The circuit court judge at the second trial denied the motion\r\n  to dismiss.Â  In denying the motion to dismiss that judge made two seemingly\r\n  inconsistent findings.Â  That judge stated:\r\n\r\n  I am\r\n    resolving this motion completely independent of whether or not the prosecutor\r\n    intentionally goated [sic] the defense into making a motion for a mistrial. . .\r\n    . \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n    . . . Even if there had been prosecutorial misconduct, it was the fact that the\r\n    jury was deadlocked that caused the mistrial.Â  \r\n  . . . . So regardless of my analysis of what happened\r\n    in the first trial, this motion to dismiss is denied because it was the jury's\r\n    being deadlocked that lead to the manifest necessity that lead [sic] to the\r\n    mistrial. \r\n\r\nShortly\r\n  after making the above finding, the circuit court judge also found the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n  I do not\r\n    find that the prosecutor specifically committed misconduct that was designed to\r\n    elicit a motion for mistrial from Defendant so that the prosecutor would have\r\n    another bite at the apple, another time to try the Defendant.Â  I believe that\r\n    the prosecutor was vigorously trying to win the case and not trying to throw\r\n    the case in the way of a mistrial.Â  So I am for those reasons, denying the\r\n    motions [sic] to dismiss based on double jeopardy.\r\n  The second trial proceeded\r\n    and the jury convicted Petitioner of murder.Â  Petitioner appealed to the court\r\n    of appeals.Â  The court of appeals affirmed the denial of Petitioner's motion to\r\n    dismiss based on double jeopardy.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    court of appeals err in affirming the circuit court judge's denial of defense\r\n    counsel's motion to dismiss pursuant to the Double Jeopardy Clauses?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate\r\n  court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1,\r\n  5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;This Court does not\r\n  re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence but simply determines whether the trial judge's ruling is supported by\r\n  any evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829. \r\nLAW/ANAYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues the\r\n  solicitor who initially prosecuted Petitioner intentionally provoked defense\r\n  counsel into moving for a mistrial.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clauses of the\r\n  United States and South Carolina Constitutions protect\r\n  citizens from being twice placed in jeopardy of life or liberty.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. V; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12; Harden v. State, 360\r\n  S.C. 405, 410, 602 S.E.2d 48, 50&nbsp;(2004) (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Under\r\n  the law of double jeopardy, a defendant may not be prosecuted for the same\r\n  offense after an acquittal, a conviction, or an improvidently granted\r\n  mistrial.&quot;Â  State v. Coleman,&nbsp;365 S.C. 258, 263, 616 S.E.2d\r\n  444, 446&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted).\r\n&quot;Prosecutorial conduct\r\n  that might be viewed as harassment or overreaching, even if sufficient to\r\n  justify a mistrial on defendant's motion . .\r\n  . does not bar retrial absent intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert\r\n  the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.&quot;Â  Oregon v.\r\n    Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 675-76, 102 S. Ct. 2083, 2089&nbsp;(1982).[1]Â \r\n  Hence, a properly granted mistrial poses no double jeopardy bar to a subsequent\r\n  prosecution.Â  &quot;Only where the governmental conduct in question is intended\r\n  to 'goad' the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the\r\n  bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the\r\n  first on his own motion.&quot;Â  Id. at 676, 102 S. Ct. at 2089; see also State v. Mathis, 359 S.C. 450, 460, 597 S.E.2d 872,\r\n  877&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (noting that a defendant who has moved for and been\r\n  granted a mistrial may invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent a second\r\n  prosecution when the prosecutor's conduct giving rise to the mistrial was\r\n  intended to provoke him into moving for the mistrial). Â Hence, the\r\n  determination of whether double jeopardy attaches depends upon whether the\r\n  prosecutorial conduct was undertaken with the intent to subvert the Double\r\n  Jeopardy Clause.Â  State v. Coleman,&nbsp;365 S.C. 258, 263, 616 S.E.2d\r\n  444, 447&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted).Â  &quot;The trial court's\r\n  finding concerning the prosecutor's intent is a factual one and will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals held:\r\n\r\n  At the\r\n    second trial, Judge Few first denied the motion to dismiss based on the jury\r\n    deadlock. Â We need not address this issue as we are restricted in our review of\r\n    his further factual finding that the solicitor had not intentionally goaded the\r\n    defense into moving for a mistrial. Â We find support in the record to affirm\r\n    the finding that the solicitor did not intentionally goad Parker into moving\r\n    for a mistrial. Â Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the motion\r\n    to dismiss based on double jeopardy.\r\n\r\nParker, 381 S.C. at 544, 673 S.E.2d at 836.Â  This holding is\r\n  erroneous because it relies upon a letter not in the record and upon the second\r\n  judge's incorrect conclusions.Â  \r\n&quot;Case law . . . has\r\n  consistently emphasized that application of the double jeopardy bar is\r\n  dependent on a showing of the prosecutor's subjective intent to cause a\r\n  mistrial in order to retry the case.&quot;Â  U.S. v. Williams,&nbsp;472\r\n  F.3d 81, 85-86&nbsp;(3rd Cir. 2007).Â  The intent necessary is not that &quot;a\r\n  person intends the natural and probable consequences of his or her acts if\r\n  those acts are knowingly done.&quot;Â  Id. at 88.Â  If a court focuses on\r\n  the natural and probable consequences of prosecutorial conduct, rather than the\r\n  intent underlying that conduct, then any prosecutorial misconduct could bar\r\n  retrial.Â  Id.Â  Hence, courts have to determine whether the subjective\r\n  intent of the solicitor was to cause a mistrial.Â  This is not an easy task to\r\n  undertake, because it is almost unimaginable that a solicitor would admit that\r\n  he or she took certain actions in an effort to cause the defendant to move for\r\n  a mistrial.Â  In our opinion, it will be rare that the solicitor actually\r\n  intends to cause the defendant to move for a mistrial.Â  However, in this case,\r\n  if we do not hold the solicitor intentionally caused the defense to move for a\r\n  mistrial, then it would seem the only possible way to find that a solicitor\r\n  intentionally goaded the defense would be for a solicitor to admit he or she\r\n  took certain actions in an effort to goad the defense. \r\nThe judge in the first trial\r\n  found, &quot;[I]t's almost as if . . . this court can infer that the defendant\r\n  was almost goaded into the position of asking for a mistrial.&quot;Â  We\r\n  construe this as a holding by the first trial judge that the solicitor\r\n  intentionally goaded defense counsel into moving for a mistrial.Â  Regarding\r\n  double jeopardy, the judge at the second trial held, &quot;So I do not find\r\n  that the prosecutor specifically committed misconduct that was designed to\r\n  elicit a motion for mistrial from Defendant so that the prosecutor would have\r\n  another bite at the apple . . . .&quot;Â  It was clearly erroneous for the\r\n  second judge to find that the solicitor's conduct was not designed to elicit a\r\n  motion for a mistrial in light of the first judge's finding that Petitioner was\r\n  goaded into asking for a mistrial.[2]Â \r\n  In cases of this type, the second trial judge makes a double jeopardy\r\n  determination based on what the previous court actually held.Â  The second trial\r\n  judge should have determined what the first trial judge held and then\r\n  determined whether that finding was supported by the facts.Â  Thus, it was error\r\n  for the second trial judge to find that the solicitor did not intentionally\r\n  goad defense counsel.Â  Â Â \r\nThe court of appeals merely\r\n  mentions that it finds support in the record to affirm the second judge's\r\n  finding regarding intentionally goading defense counsel, without listing any\r\n  such evidence.Â Â Â  We hold there is no evidence in the record to support the\r\n  second judge's finding that the solicitor did not intend to elicit a motion for\r\n  a mistrial.Â  However, there is evidence in the record to support the first\r\n  trial judge's finding that Petitioner was goaded into seeking a mistrial.Â  The\r\n  solicitor's statements about Petitioner's counsel,[3] encouraging the jury to convict in order to protect the community, and the\r\n  introduction of the original videotape show that it was the solicitor's intent\r\n  to cause a mistrial.Â  Standing alone, any one of these actions might not show\r\n  subjective intent on the part of the solicitor to goad the defense into seeking\r\n  a mistrial.Â  Rather, similar to what the first trial judge held, the totality\r\n  of what occurred in the first trial leads to the conclusion that it was the\r\n  intent of the solicitor to goad defense counsel to move for a mistrial. \r\nThe court of appeals relied\r\n  in part on a letter from Judge Hayes, the judge in the first trial, to\r\n  Solicitor Robert Ariail.Â  The court of appeals noted, &quot;We first must pay\r\n  deference to Judge Hayes' [sic] letter indicating he did not rule on the\r\n  jeopardy issue in granting the motion for a mistrial at the end of the first\r\n  trial.&quot;Â  Parker, 381 S.C. at 544, 673 S.E.2d at 836.Â  &quot;Except\r\n  as provided by Rule 212 and Rule 208(b)(1)(C) and (2), the appellate court will\r\n  not consider any fact which does not appear in the Record on Appeal.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 210(h), SCACR.Â  The letter from Judge Hayes to Solicitor Ariail is not in\r\n  the Record.Â  Hence, it was error for the court of appeals to rely on that\r\n  letter in their opinion.\r\nAdditionally, the second\r\n  trial judge made the legal finding that it was the jury deadlock that caused\r\n  the mistrial.Â  The first judge, however, never made a ruling that jury deadlock\r\n  caused the mistrial.Â  Rather, the first judge specifically granted a mistrial\r\n  based on prosecutorial misconduct.Â  Because the first judge granted a mistrial\r\n  based on prosecutorial misconduct, the second judge's finding that &quot;it was\r\n  the fact that the jury was deadlocked that caused the mistrial&quot; was a\r\n  legal error. We hold the finding that the solicitor did not intentionally goad\r\n  the defense into moving for a mistrial was clearly erroneous. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the solicitor\r\n  intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial, the court of appeals\r\n  opinion is reversed and further prosecution barred under the Double Jeopardy\r\n  Clauses.Â  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  and Acting Justice John H.

Factual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nAt approximately 6:15 p.m. on\r\n  August 10, 2001, Amy Westbury left her Lexington County home to go to work.Â \r\n  When she returned home the next morning around 11:00 a.m., Westbury discovered\r\n  that someone had broken into her home through a bedroom window. Â Westbury's\r\n  review of the home revealed that only items belonging to her and not her\r\n  husband had been taken.Â  Specifically, Westbury noticed the following items\r\n  were missing:Â  several dresses, a sequined gown, a taffeta gown, several pairs\r\n  of shoes, workout leotards, undergarments, a couple of children's dresses, a\r\n  bottle of perfume, makeup, jewelry, and a pillowcase from the master bedroom.Â  \r\nShortly after discovering the\r\n  break-in, the Westburys contacted the Lexington County Sheriff's Department. During\r\n  the course of the investigation, Captain Joe Quig followed up on &quot;a lead\r\n  out of Calhoun County.&quot;Â  According to Captain Quig, he received\r\n  information that some of the stolen items may have been deposited in an\r\n  abandoned house located off &quot;a frontage road on I-26 right inside of\r\n  Calhoun County, right outside of Lexington County.&quot; \r\nOn August 24, 2001, Captain\r\n  Quig decided to investigate the abandoned house.Â  Prior to entering Calhoun\r\n  County, Quig contacted the Calhoun County Sheriff's Department and spoke with\r\n  Sheriff Summers regarding the alleged stolen property.Â  According to Quig,\r\n  &quot;the Sheriff said help myself, go ahead and take a look at the house; and\r\n  that if I found anything that didn't belong to us, he wanted me to catalog it\r\n  and turn it into the Calhoun County Sheriff's Department for processing for\r\n  possibly being a stolen item out of their area or their jurisdiction.&quot;\r\nWhen Captain Quig and other Lexington\r\n  County officers investigated the outside of the house and looked through the\r\n  windows, they saw &quot;female clothes&quot; and &quot;pornographic magazines\r\n  on the floor and things like that.&quot;Â Â Â  Because he believed some of the\r\n  items may have belonged to Amy Westbury, Captain Quig procured a search warrant\r\n  for the house. \r\nAs a result of their\r\n  discovery, Captain Quig and other Lexington County officers, including\r\n  Lieutenant Henry Dukes, set up surveillance of the abandoned house on August 24\r\n  and 25, 2001.Â  Captain Quig claimed he had &quot;cleared&quot; the surveillance\r\n  operation with Sheriff Summers.Â  Quig testified that &quot;[t]heir edict to us\r\n  was 'Fine, have at it.Â  We can't help you with it.Â  If you find anything or\r\n  anything comes up, call us.'&quot; \r\nOn the second night of the\r\n  surveillance operation, Lieutenant Dukes made radio contact with the Calhoun\r\n  County Sheriff's Department.Â  In response to the call, Sheriff Summers and\r\n  several of his deputies came to the surveillance location.Â  Lieutenant Dukes\r\n  then discussed the operation with Sheriff Summers and requested that a Calhoun\r\n  County officer remain at the location.Â  According to Lieutenant Dukes, Sheriff\r\n  Summers stated, &quot;It looks like you are doing a fine job.Â  You have got\r\n  everything under control as far as I'm concerned.&quot;Â  Sheriff Summers also\r\n  did not believe it was necessary for a Calhoun County officer to remain with\r\n  Lieutenant Dukes but assured him that he would return if assistance was needed.Â  \r\nAt approximately 10:30 p.m.\r\n  on August 25, 2001, a man drove up to the abandoned house.Â  Lieutenant Dukes\r\n  observed the man, who was later identified as Boswell, stop the vehicle and\r\n  turn off all the lights except for the interior light.Â  As Lieutenant Dukes\r\n  approached the vehicle, he saw Boswell &quot;bringing different items out of\r\n  the vehicle and chunking them into the woods.&quot;Â  When he turned his\r\n  flashlight on Boswell, Lieutenant Dukes observed Boswell &quot;with his pants down\r\n  around his ankles.Â  He had something in his hand wrapped around his penis, and\r\n  he was masturbating as he was throwing things out of the vehicle into the\r\n  hedgerow and also onto the ground.&quot;Â  After Lieutenant Dukes identified\r\n  himself, he directed Boswell to stop what he was doing and put his hands where\r\n  the officer could see them. Â Boswell ignored the command and continued to reach\r\n  into the vehicle and throw out items, including a knife and a crowbar.Â  As a\r\n  result, the officers threw Boswell to the ground, handcuffed him, and placed\r\n  him in investigative detention.Â  Lieutenant Dukes then ascertained Boswell's\r\n  identity, read him his Miranda[2] rights, and placed him in a Lexington County patrol car to await the arrival of\r\n  Captain Quig.Â  Lieutenant Dukes explained that Boswell was detained for\r\n  &quot;[b]eing at the location nude, masturbating, also throwing weapons, and\r\n  not following law enforcement that was fully identified.&quot;\r\nShortly thereafter, Lieutenant\r\n  Dukes contacted Sheriff Summers and Captain Quig.Â  When Captain Quig arrived, he\r\n  spoke to the Lexington County officers as well as Sheriff Summers and two\r\n  Calhoun County deputies.Â  \r\nThe officers' subsequent\r\n  search of Boswell's vehicle revealed what one officer described as burglary\r\n  tools, which included a pair of gloves, a hammer, a screwdriver, and a\r\n  flashlight.Â  The vehicle also contained &quot;gym bags&quot; that had\r\n  &quot;various clothing items.&quot;\r\nAfter speaking with Sheriff\r\n  Summers, Captain Quig &quot;determined that we had more [than] probable cause\r\n  to arrest [Boswell] with the burglary tools and the things that were in that\r\n  field that he had thrown out on the ground.&quot;Â  He then transported Boswell\r\n  to the Lexington County Sheriff's Department.Â  Â Â \r\nOn August 26, 2001, Boswell\r\n  gave a recorded statement in which he confessed to the burglary.Â  On August 28,\r\n  2001, Captain Quig had Boswell review the transcribed statement and check it\r\n  for accuracy.Â  That same day, Boswell agreed to give another statement.Â  This\r\n  statement, however, was given while Boswell rode with Captain Quig in a patrol\r\n  vehicle.Â  According to the text of the statement, Boswell directed Captain Quig\r\n  to drive to the Westburys' home. When they arrived, Boswell again confessed to\r\n  burglarizing the Westburys' home.Â  \r\nSubsequently, a Lexington\r\n  County grand jury indicted Boswell for first-degree burglary on the ground that\r\n  the entry into the Westbury home occurred in the nighttime.Â  \r\nPrior to trial and throughout\r\n  the trial, Boswell's counsel sought to suppress Boswell's confessions to\r\n  Captain Quig on the ground that they were the products of an unlawful arrest\r\n  made without legal authority by Lexington County law enforcement officers\r\n  acting outside their territorial jurisdiction.Â  Â Â In response, the State\r\n  offered evidence of a 1999 &quot;multi-jurisdictional agreement&quot; entered\r\n  into between the Calhoun County and Lexington County Sheriffs' Departments that\r\n  purported to confer the authority of officers to arrest in the other county's\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Â Â \r\nIn a pre-trial ruling, the\r\n  trial judge denied Boswell's counsel's motion.Â  Specifically, he found that\r\n  &quot;the Lexington County deputies did act consistently with the standard required\r\n  by the statute.&quot; Â Throughout the trial, the judge reiterated this ruling\r\n  each time Boswell's counsel interjected an objection.Â  \r\nFollowing the denial of its\r\n  motion for a directed verdict, the defense presented Boswell as its sole\r\n  witness.Â  Although Boswell admitted to committing the burglary, he testified it\r\n  occurred during the daytime and not the nighttime as stated in his confessions.\r\n  Â In explaining this discrepancy, Boswell testified that he was\r\n  &quot;confused&quot; because he was not taking his medication for bipolar\r\n  disorder and he was &quot;coming off&quot; the Valium that he had taken prior\r\n  to his arrest.Â  Boswell also believed he committed the burglary because he was\r\n  not taking his medication for bipolar disorder.Â  He claimed he had not taken\r\n  the medication for approximately one year before the August 2001 burglary.Â  Â Â \r\nUltimately, the jury\r\n  convicted Boswell of first-degree burglary.Â  The trial judge sentenced Boswell\r\n  to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.Â  In a post-trial\r\n  motion, Boswell's counsel moved for a new trial on the ground that Boswell's\r\n  arrest was unlawful and any evidence obtained as the result of the arrest was\r\n  inadmissible.Â  Additionally, counsel requested the trial judge reconsider the\r\n  life sentence. \r\nBy order dated May 12, 2008, Circuit\r\n  Court Judge James Johnson[3] denied Boswell's motions for a new trial and reconsideration of his sentence. Â Subsequently,\r\n  Boswell appealed his conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeals.Â  This\r\n  Court certified the appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nII. Discussion\r\nA.\r\nBoswell contends the trial\r\n  judge erred in declining to suppress his confessions to Captain Quig as\r\n  they were the product of an unlawful arrest by the Lexington County officers\r\n  acting outside their territorial jurisdiction.Â  In support of this contention,\r\n  Boswell asserts that neither the 1999 multi-jurisdictional agreement nor any\r\n  provision of South Carolina law authorized the Lexington County deputies to\r\n  arrest him in Calhoun County.Â  Because his arrest was unlawful, Boswell argues\r\n  that his confessions were inadmissible as they were the &quot;fruit of the\r\n  poisonous tree.&quot;[4]Â  \r\nB.\r\nAs a threshold matter, the\r\n  State claims that Boswell failed to properly preserve this issue for appellate\r\n  review.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBased on our review of the\r\n  record, Boswell's counsel clearly argued that Boswell's statements should have been\r\n  suppressed as they were the product of Lexington County officers acting outside\r\n  their territorial jurisdiction.Â  Because counsel and the judge simply used the\r\n  term &quot;jurisdiction,&quot; the judge at times seemed to interpret this term\r\n  as &quot;subject matter jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Given that territorial\r\n  jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction are separate and distinct\r\n  concepts, there was some confusion amongst counsel and the judge as to the use\r\n  of the term &quot;jurisdiction.&quot;Â Â  See Smith v. Commonwealth,\r\n  693 S.E.2d 765, 769 (Va. Ct. App. 2010) (parsing the term &quot;jurisdiction&quot;\r\n  and recognizing that subject matter jurisdiction is the authority granted\r\n  through the constitution or statute to adjudicate a class of cases or\r\n  controversies and that territorial jurisdiction is the authority over persons,\r\n  things or occurrences located in a defined geographical area); see also State v. Dudley, 364 S.C. 578, 614 S.E.2d 623 (2005) (recognizing that the\r\n  State's extra-territorial jurisdiction is not a component of subject matter jurisdiction).Â  \r\nDespite the specific\r\n  terminology error, the judge understood that Boswell's counsel was moving to\r\n  suppress the confessions as the fruit of an unlawful arrest.[5]Â \r\n  Moreover, in denying this motion, the judge stated that &quot;the Lexington\r\n  County deputies did act consistently with the standard required by the statute\r\n  and [I] deny the motion to dismiss on lack of jurisdiction.&quot;Â  As we\r\n  interpret this ruling, the judge clearly considered and ruled on the\r\n  territorial arrest powers of the Lexington County deputies in Calhoun County. Additionally,\r\n  Boswell's counsel repeatedly raised this argument and interjected an objection\r\n  to the admission of Boswell's statements throughout the trial.Â  \r\nFinally, we reject any\r\n  assertion that Boswell's confessions were cumulative to Boswell's trial\r\n  testimony.Â  Because the judge had ruled against the defense motion, counsel\r\n  called Boswell as a witness to explain these confessions.Â  Thus, Boswell should\r\n  not now be precluded from raising this properly preserved issue on appeal.\r\nC.\r\nFinding the issue preserved, the\r\n  question becomes whether the Lexington County officers were authorized to\r\n  arrest Boswell in Calhoun County. \r\nAs an initial matter, it is\r\n  undisputed that the Lexington County officers were not &quot;in pursuit&quot;\r\n  of Boswell from Lexington County into Calhoun County; thus, section 17-13-40 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code is not relevant to our determination of this issue.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-40(B) (2003) (&quot;When the police authorities of a\r\n  county are in pursuit of an offender for a violation of a county ordinance or\r\n  statute of this State committed within the county, the authorities may arrest\r\n  the offender, with or without a warrant, at a place within the county, or at a\r\n  place within an adjacent county.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, there is no\r\n  substantiated evidence that the Lexington County officers had a warrant for\r\n  Boswell's arrest.[6]\r\nTherefore, the only two grounds\r\n  by which the Lexington County officers could have been authorized to arrest\r\n  Boswell in Calhoun County are the 1999 multi-jurisdictional agreement or via a private\r\n  citizen's arrest. Â In order for the 1999 agreement to confer arrest authority, we\r\n  must find that the agreement was valid and that its terms covered the factual\r\n  scenario presented in the instant case.Â  Alternatively, if we find that the\r\n  1999 agreement did not authorize the arrest, we must determine whether the\r\n  Lexington County officers effectuated a proper citizen's arrest.\r\nOn April 16, 1999, Lexington\r\n  County Sheriff James Metts and Calhoun County Sheriff Dennis Jones signed a\r\n  written agreement &quot;for the purpose of securing to each other the benefits\r\n  of mutual aid in the event of natural disaster, disorder, or other emergency\r\n  situations . . . .&quot;Â  The terms of the agreement incorporate the text of\r\n  sections 23-1-210 and 17-13-45 of the South Carolina Code, which govern\r\n  agreements involving the temporary transfer of law enforcement officers.[7]\r\nIn\r\n  2000, the Legislature promulgated section 23-20-50 to require County approval\r\n  of multi-jurisdictional agreements.Â  This section states:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp; An agreement entered into pursuant\r\n    to this chapter on behalf of a law enforcement authority must be approved by\r\n    the appropriate state, county, or local law enforcement authority's chief\r\n    executive officer.Â  A state law enforcement authority must provide a copy of\r\n    the agreement to the Governor and the Executive Director of the State Budget\r\n    and Control Board no later than one business day after executing the\r\n    agreement.Â  An agreement entered into with a local law enforcement authority\r\n    pursuant to this chapter must be approved by the governing body of each\r\n    jurisdiction.Â  For agreements entered into prior to June 1, 2000, the\r\n      agreement may be ratified by the governing body of each jurisdiction.\r\n  (B)&nbsp; The officers of the law\r\n    enforcement provider have the same legal rights, powers, and duties to enforce\r\n    the laws of South Carolina as the law enforcement agency contracting for the services.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-20-50(A),\r\n  (B) (2007) (emphasis added).\r\nGiven this statute was in\r\n  effect at the time of Boswell's arrest, we must assess the validity of the 1999\r\n  agreement.Â  The last sentence of subsection A states that &quot;the agreement\r\n  may be ratified by the governing bodies of each jurisdiction.&quot;Â  The State\r\n  construes the phrase &quot;may be ratified&quot; to mean that the governing\r\n  bodies of Calhoun and Lexington counties did not have to formally approve the 1999\r\n  agreement after the 2000 amendment.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn contrast to the State's\r\n  interpretation, we construe subsection A as requiring governing bodies to\r\n  formally approve a pre-existing agreement if it is to retain its validity.[8]Â \r\n  Taking into account the significance of territorial jurisdiction, we believe a\r\n  more stringent approach needs to be followed in order to confer this type of\r\n  authority.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the\r\n  General Counsel for the Lexington County Sheriff's Department admitted that the\r\n  1999 agreement had been &quot;sent to&quot; but not voted on by the county\r\n  council.Â  Based on the failure to satisfy the requisite statutory provisions,\r\n  we find the 1999 agreement was invalid.Â  Thus, it could not have operated to authorize\r\n  the Lexington County officers to arrest Boswell in Calhoun County.Â  Cf. Commonwealth\r\n    v. Novick, 438 A.2d 974 (Pa. Super Ct. 1981), appeal dismissed as\r\n      improvidently granted, 458 A.2d 1350 (Pa. 1983) (concluding that, absent a\r\n  proven joint municipal contract for police protection between the jurisdictions\r\n  involved, an extra-jurisdictional arrest for burglary by local police officer\r\n  without a warrant was invalid, even though made on &quot;probable cause&quot;\r\n  to suspect the arrestee of burglary; reversing trial court's decision refusing\r\n  to suppress an overwhelming quantity of evidence resulting from oral and\r\n  written inculpatory statements by the arrestee following the arrest in\r\n  question).\r\nEven assuming the 1999\r\n  agreement was valid, the terms of the agreement did not cover the actions of\r\n  the Lexington County officers as the employment of officers from the adjacent\r\n  jurisdiction was to occur only in the event of emergency situations or when one\r\n  jurisdiction specifically requested the assistance of officers from the\r\n  adjacent jurisdiction.[9]Â \r\n  Moreover, the agreement clearly intended for the Lexington County and Calhoun\r\n  County officers to work simultaneously.\r\nNone of the above-outlined\r\n  requirements were present in the instant case. Â Here, Lexington County officers\r\n  &quot;cleared&quot; their surveillance operation with the Sheriff of Calhoun\r\n  County.Â  Although Sheriff Summers and several officers were present at the\r\n  beginning of the surveillance operation, Sheriff Summers did not feel that it\r\n  was necessary for his county officers to remain at the surveillance site.Â \r\n  Furthermore, no Calhoun County officers were present at the time of Boswell's\r\n  arrest.Â  In view of the specific facts of instant case, we conclude the 1999\r\n  agreement did not authorize the Lexington County officers to arrest Boswell in\r\n  Calhoun County. \r\nIn view of our finding that\r\n  the 1999 agreement did not authorize the Lexington County officers to arrest\r\n  Boswell outside of their territorial jurisdiction, the question becomes whether\r\n  the officers acting as &quot;private citizens&quot; could have effectuated the\r\n  arrest.\r\nThe key case in this\r\n  determination is State v. McAteer, 340 S.C. 644, 532 S.E.2d 865 (2000).Â \r\n  In McActeer, an off-duty (but still uniformed) municipal officer\r\n  observed McAteer drive his automobile approximately 250 yards on a dirt road\r\n  outside the municipality's city limits. Â The officer approached the car, and\r\n  McAteer rolled down the window.Â  Id. at 646, 532 S.E.2d at 865.Â  The\r\n  officer smelled alcohol and observed open alcoholic beverage containers in the\r\n  car, and detained McAteer until a Highway patrolman arrived.Â  Id.Â  The patrolman\r\n  administered several field sobriety tests to McAteer, then formally arrested\r\n  him and transported him to the York County Detention Center where McAteer blew\r\n  a .18 on the breathalyzer.Â  Id.\r\nBecause the officer was\r\n  outside the municipality's city limits when he first observed McAteer, this\r\n  Court found that he had no police authority to detain McAteer.Â  Id. at\r\n  646, 532 S.E.2d at 866.Â  We, however, considered the question of whether the\r\n  officer was authorized to arrest McAteer as a private citizen.Â  Id.Â \r\n  After conducting a thorough survey of statutory and common law, this Court\r\n  ultimately held that &quot;there is no common law right to make warrantless\r\n  citizen's arrests of any kind and that such rights as exist are created by\r\n  statute in South Carolina.&quot;Â  Id. at 650, 532 S.E.2d at 868.Â Â  Â \r\nOur decision in McAteer clearly limited a citizen's power to arrest only in those instances involving a\r\n  felony.Â  McAteer, 340 S.C. at 646-47, 532 S.E.2d at 866 (citing section\r\n  17-13-10, which provides that a citizen may arrest upon view of felony\r\n  committed, and finding inapplicable section 17-13-20, which permits other\r\n  warrantless citizen's arrests for events occurring in the nighttime given\r\n  McAteer's arrest occurred in the daytime and involved a misdemeanor and not a\r\n  felony).Â  \r\nHere, Boswell's actions may\r\n  have supported an arrest for indecent exposure; however, this offense is a\r\n  misdemeanor.[10]Â \r\n  Because the Lexington County officers did not witness Boswell commit a felony,\r\n  they could not have effectuated a citizen's arrest of Boswell under McAteer. \r\nThus, the question becomes\r\n  whether there is any other ground to support a citizen's arrest.Â  The only\r\n  conceivable avenue would be pursuant to section 17-13-20(d) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, which provides for a citizen's arrest if the citizen witnesses\r\n  another disposing of stolen items in the nighttime.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  17-13-20(d) (2003) (&quot;A citizen may arrest a person in the nighttime by\r\n  efficient means as the darkness and the probability of escape render necessary,\r\n  even if the life of the person should be taken, when the person . . . has in\r\n  his possession stolen property.&quot;).\r\nWe find the facts do not\r\n  support a citizen's arrest under section 17-13-20(d).Â  When Boswell arrived at\r\n  the abandoned house, Lieutenant Dukes observed him throw several items out of\r\n  the vehicle, including a crowbar and a knife.Â  Although these items could have\r\n  been legitimately construed as burglary tools, it would have been purely\r\n  speculative for Lieutenant Dukes to identify these items as stolen.Â  Lieutenant\r\n  Dukes essentially admitted this fact when he conceded that he had no way of\r\n  knowing whether any of the items came from Lexington County. Â Based on his\r\n  observations, he could only discern that the items &quot;were consistent with\r\n  items that we were looking for from the burglary that happened in Lexington\r\n  County.&quot;Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude\r\n  Boswell's arrest was unlawful as there was no specific statutory authorization\r\n  or valid agreement between Lexington County and Calhoun County to authorize the\r\n  warrantless arrest.Â  See Russell G. Donaldson, Annotation, Validity,\r\n    In State Criminal Trial, of Arrest Without Warrant By Identified Peace Officers\r\n    Outside of Jurisdiction, When Not in Fresh Pursuit, 34 A.L.R.4th 328, Â§ 4\r\n  at 337 (1984 &amp; Supp. 2011) (&quot;There is authority to the effect that,\r\n  absent specific statutory authorization such as a 'fresh pursuit' law, or valid\r\n  agreements between adjoining or neighboring governmental entities creating\r\n  specific authority for extrajurisdictional, warrantless arrests by police\r\n  officers, there can be no validity in such an arrest, the assertion of\r\n  purported official authority therein negating any theory that the arresting\r\n  officer or officers could have been acting as 'private citizens' at the\r\n  time.&quot;).[11]Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, we hold the\r\n  Lexington County officers were not authorized to arrest Boswell in Calhoun\r\n  County as the 1999 agreement did not confer this power and there is no South\r\n  Carolina statute that would support a citizen's arrest.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  trial judge erred in refusing to suppress Boswell's confessions as the product\r\n  of the unlawful arrest.[12]\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[13]\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See S.C.

Todd, Assistant Disciplinary\r\n          Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        David Hart\r\n          Breen, of Myrtle Beach, pro se respondent.Â Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and\r\n  respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to\r\n  Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to the imposition of an admonition or a public reprimand, along with\r\n  law office management requirements. Â We accept the agreement, and issue a\r\n  public reprimand and impose law office management requirements as detailed\r\n  later in this opinion.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as\r\n  follows.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\n\r\nMatter I\r\nIn 2002 and 2003, respondent filed several bankruptcy\r\n  petitions well after his clients had completed payment for his services and, in\r\n  some cases, well after they had completed their paperwork.Â  In June of 2003,\r\n  the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of South Carolina ordered\r\n  respondent to refund the fees paid by four of his clients.Â  After the Assistant\r\n  United States Trustee filed a second complaint, respondent and the United\r\n  States Trustee's Office entered into consent orders which addressed the\r\n  concerns of the Trustee's Office and in which respondent agreed to return the\r\n  fees paid by four additional clients.Â  These consent orders were approved by\r\n  the Bankruptcy Court in October of 2003.\r\nRespondent represents he has resolved the issues giving rise\r\n  to these complaints.Â  He states he now ensures bankruptcy petitions are filed\r\n  in a timely manner.Â  In addition to changes in his office practices, respondent\r\n  represents he has resolved staff supervision issues that resulted in some of\r\n  the delays.Â Â  Â Â \r\nMatter II\r\nComplainant retained respondent in October 2002 to represent\r\n  her in a worker's compensation claim against a federal agency.Â  Respondent\r\n  represents he informed the client he was not experienced in handling matters\r\n  governed by the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, but would review her\r\n  records and seek experienced co-counsel.Â  \r\nIn August of 2003, respondent wrote Complainant indicating\r\n  he had not succeeded in finding co-counsel.Â  In the letter, respondent informed\r\n  Complainant she would need to find counsel and file a claim within twenty-five\r\n  (25) days.Â  Respondent asserts he did communicate with Complainant after being\r\n  retained and before the August 2003 letter.Â Â  \r\nAfter receipt of the complaint from ODC, respondent learned\r\n  Complainant had previously preserved her claim against a defense that it was\r\n  not timely filed and he was in error \r\nin advising her she only had twenty-five (25) days to file\r\n  her claim.\r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent acknowledges he failed to properly maintain his\r\n  trust account and maintain the records required by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  In\r\n  particular, he admits that:Â  1) on some occasions he failed to record credits\r\n  and debits on his check stubs, 2) on numerous occasions he failed to record the\r\n  client or file associated with the credits and debits, 3) he made cash\r\n  withdrawals from his trust account, and 4) failed to reconcile his trust\r\n  account.Â  Respondent represents he relied on his memory to keep track of whose\r\n  money he held in his trust account at any given time.Â  \r\nRespondent admits that, on two occasions in 2005,\r\n  respondent's law office telephone bill was paid from his trust account.Â Â \r\n  Respondent does not know whether the funds from the trust account were ever\r\n  replaced.Â  \r\nIn November 2006, respondent deposited $12,822.21 into his\r\n  law office trust account.Â  These funds were loaned to him from a trust fund\r\n  belonging to his wife.Â  Â Respondent submits he deposited these funds to cover a\r\n  shortfall he caused in his trust account by withdrawing accumulated costs\r\n  payable to his office.Â  He explains that he accidently withdrew too much money from\r\n  the trust account because he was relying on his memory.Â  Respondent cannot\r\n  identify the withdrawal or withdrawals that triggered his November 2006\r\n  deposit.Â  Additionally, upon learning that he had deposited more funds than\r\n  were necessary to cover the excess withdrawal(s), respondent then left the\r\n  funds in his account and paid the funds back to his wife on a piecemeal basis.Â \r\n  Respondent concedes that failing to timely withdraw costs, depositing the funds\r\n  from his wife's trust, and failing to return the excess funds all constituted\r\n  impermissible comingling of funds.Â  Â \r\nIn 2008, respondent began working with a bookkeeper to\r\n  reconcile his trust account.Â  He represents he provides the bookkeeper with his\r\n  check stubs and bank statements so that she can reconcile the account.Â \r\n  Although respondent is not providing the bookkeeper with client ledgers, he\r\n  asserts he has been reviewing the bookkeeper's reconciliations line by line.Â  \r\nAdditionally, during 2008, respondent made a series of\r\n  electronic transfers from his law office trust account to his operating account\r\n  to remove funds he asserts belonged to him rather than to his clients.Â \r\n  Respondent explains these transfers were made as part of his efforts to ensure\r\n  that the funds he held in trust were those of his clients alone and that he\r\n  relied on his memory to determineÂ  the sums that needed to be removed.Â  \r\nRespondent asserts that none of his clients lost any money\r\n  as a result of his failure to properly maintain his trust account.Â  ODC has no\r\n  information to dispute this assertion.Â  \r\nIn addition to trust account irregularities, respondent\r\n  collected fees in workers' compensation matters before the fee petitions were\r\n  approved by the Workers' Compensation Commission.Â  \r\nIn remediation, respondent completed the South Carolina\r\n  Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School on October 15, 2009,\r\n  which included two hours of trust account instruction.Â  Since completing the\r\n  program, respondent believes he has a better understanding of his\r\n  responsibilities for managing his trust account and maintaining his financial\r\n  records.Â  For example, respondent is now insuring his disbursement sheets,\r\n  which he uses as client ledgers, are compared with his bank statements during\r\n  the monthly reconciliations of his accounts.Â  \r\nRespondent has been fully cooperative throughout ODC's\r\n  investigation.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nÂ Respondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule\r\n  1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\n  with reasonable diligence and competence in representing client); Rule 1.4\r\n  (lawyer shall provide reasonable communication to client); Rule 1.15 (lawyer\r\n  shall hold funds of client separately from lawyer's own funds); Rule 3.2\r\n  (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with\r\n  interests of client); Rule 3.4(c) (lawyer shall not knowingly disobey\r\n  obligation under rules of tribunal); and Rule 5.3 (lawyer having supervisory\r\n  authority over non-lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to insure that person's\r\n  conduct is compatible with professional obligations of lawyer).Â  Further,\r\n  respondent admits that he has violated the financial recordkeeping provisions\r\n  of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes\r\n  grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for a\r\n  lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public\r\n  reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and\r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  \r\nÂ Within forty-five (45) days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall retain a law office management advisor acceptable to the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission).Â  Within sixty (60) days of the\r\n  date of this opinion, respondent shall meet with the advisor to conduct a\r\n  thorough review of respondent's law office management practices, including, but\r\n  not limited to, respondent's law office accounting.Â  Within ninety (90) days of\r\n  this opinion, the law office management advisor shall file a complete report of\r\n  respondent's office management practices with the Commission.Â  The report shall\r\n  also include the advisor's review, analysis, and recommendations concerning respondent's\r\n  law office management practices.Â Â  \r\nIn addition, for two (2) years from the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall meet with his law office management advisor at least\r\n  once every six (6) months and the advisor shall submit a complete report to the\r\n  Commission within thirty (30) days of the end of each six (6) month period.Â \r\n  The law office management advisor's final report shall include a complete\r\n  assessment of respondent's law office management practices, specifically\r\n  addressing respondent's compliance with his advisor's recommendations.Â  Respondent\r\n  shall be responsible for payment of the advisor and timely submission of the\r\n  advisor's reports.Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, respondent's failure to comply with the provisions\r\n  regarding the retention of a law office management advisor, submission of the\r\n  advisor's reports, and compliance with the advisor's recommendations, shall\r\n  constitute misconduct under Rule 8.4(e), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, and shall be\r\n  grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Â \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26943","title":"In the Matter of Nancy Holland

Â We accept\r\n  the Agreement, suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for nine\r\n  months, not retroactive, and impose other requirements.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement,\r\n  are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent, along with Clyde\r\n  Pennington, agreed to represent a client on a number of bad check charges.Â  Mr.\r\n  Pennington was subsequently suspended from the practice of law.Â  The attorney\r\n  appointed to protect the interests of Mr. Pennington's clients was informed\r\n  respondent had received $693 on the client's behalf and placed it in Mr.\r\n  Pennington's trust account; however, at the time of Mr. Pennington's\r\n  suspension, those funds were no longer in the trust account and were\r\n  unaccounted for.Â  Moreover, the client executed a power of attorney allowing\r\n  respondent to obtain the client's social security payments for the purposes of\r\n  paying attorney's fees and paying off the bad checks.Â  The client alleges\r\n  respondent negotiated several of the client's social security checks.Â \r\n  Respondent admits she negotiated at least one of the client's checks, but\r\n  cannot remember whether she handled any other funds for the client.Â  However,\r\n  respondent and Mr. Pennington have no record of the receipt and disbursement of\r\n  funds on behalf of the client, and they made no payments on the bad checks on\r\n  behalf of the client nor did they represent the client at trial. Â \r\nMatter II\r\nOn June 3, 2008, respondent\r\n  deposited $2,050 in settlement funds into her trust account on behalf of a\r\n  client.Â  Respondent issued a check to herself in the amount of $734.54 for fees\r\n  and costs, and issued a check to the client for $432.06, leaving a balance of\r\n  $883.40 in the account.Â  Between September 2008 and March 2009, respondent\r\n  issued three checks payable to herself, totaling $6,350, and two checks payable\r\n  to her husband, totaling $12,000.Â  Neither respondent nor her husband was\r\n  entitled to the funds.Â  The misappropriation of these funds left a balance of\r\n  $42.60 in respondent's trust account, which was not sufficient to cover the\r\n  amount that should have been in trust for the client on whose behalf the\r\n  settlement funds were received.\r\nMatter III\r\nOn August 15, 2008,\r\n  respondent deposited $23,000 in settlement funds into her trust account on behalf\r\n  of a client.Â  Over the next couple of weeks, respondent issued two checks\r\n  payable to herself, totaling $5,500, for fees.Â  She also issued three checks to\r\n  the client totaling $4,500.Â  Respondent retained the balance of the funds for\r\n  the purpose of negotiating and paying medical liens, which she failed to do.Â \r\n  When the client learned his bills had not been paid, he attempted to contact\r\n  respondent; however, she did not respond.Â  When respondent misappropriated the\r\n  funds in Matter II, the balance of $42.60 remaining in her trust account was\r\n  not sufficient to cover the amount that should have been in trust for the\r\n  client in Matter III.\r\nFailure to Cooperate\r\nRespondent did not respond to\r\n  the notice of full investigation issued in Matter I.Â  Although she self-reported\r\n  Matters II and III, she failed to respond to the notice of full investigation\r\n  issued in those matters.Â  While respondent did appear for a Rule 19, RLDE,\r\n  interview in May 2009, she failed to comply with a subpoena for her client\r\n  files and her financial records.Â  When the interview was reconvened in December\r\n  2010, following a determination that respondent was capable of participating in\r\n  the defense of the pending grievances, respondent failed to appear.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by her conduct she has\r\n  violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a\r\n  client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the\r\n  objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by\r\n  which they are to be pursued; a lawyer may take such action on behalf of the\r\n  client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation); Rule 1.3 (a\r\n  lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a\r\n  client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall reasonably consult with the client about the\r\n  means by which the client's objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client\r\n  reasonably informed about the status of the matter and promptly comply with\r\n  reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.5 (placing limitations on when a\r\n  fee may be divided between lawyers); Rule 1.15(a) (a lawyer shall hold property\r\n  of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer's possession in connection with\r\n  a representation separate from the lawyer's own property; funds shall be kept\r\n  in a separate account;&nbsp;complete records of such account funds and other\r\n  property shall be kept by the lawyer and the lawyer shall comply with the\r\n  financial recordkeeping requirements of Rule 417, SCACR); Rule 1.15(d) (upon\r\n  receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an\r\n  interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person, except as\r\n  stated in Rule 1.15 or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the\r\n  client, promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other\r\n  property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon\r\n  request by the client or third person, promptly render a full accounting\r\n  regarding such property); Rule 8.1(b) (a lawyer in connection with a\r\n  disciplinary matter shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for\r\n  information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\r\n  deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct\r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice).Â  Respondent also admits she failed to comply with the recordkeeping\r\n  requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  She concedes these violations constitute\r\n  grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (It shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer\r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this\r\n  jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers.).\r\nMitigation\r\nIn 2008, respondent was diagnosed with\r\n  chemical dependency, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and adult\r\n  residual attention deficit disorder, resulting in problems with concentration,\r\n  alertness, memory loss, and impaired judgment.Â  Respondent commenced treatment\r\n  for her conditions in November 2008 and continues in treatment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of\r\n  law in this state for nine months from the date of this opinion.Â  We deny respondentâ€™s request that the suspension\r\n  be made retroactive to the date of her interim suspension.Â  In addition, within\r\n  thirty days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall (1) enter into a payment\r\n  plan with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct for reimbursement of the costs\r\n  incurred in the investigation of these matters; and (2) enter into a restitution\r\n  agreement with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct pursuant to which she will pay\r\n  $693 to Lena Harris, $883.40 to Bryson Teal, and $13,000 to Jerry Springfield.[2]Â  Finally, prior to applying for\r\n  reinstatement, respondent\r\n  shall complete the South Carolina Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program\r\n  Ethics School and Trust Accounting School.Â  As another condition of\r\n  reinstatement, respondent shall enter into a monitoring contract with the South\r\n  Carolina Bar's Lawyers Helping Lawyers Program which includes, at a minimum,\r\n  the requirements that respondent abstain from the use of alcohol or illegal\r\n  drugs and continue with psychiatric and/or psychological counseling for a\r\n  period of two years.Â  Following reinstatement, respondent shall report her\r\n  treatment and compliance status to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct no less\r\n  than quarterly for two years.\r\nWithin fifteen\r\n  days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the\r\n  Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension on April\r\n  30, 2009.Â  In re Mayer, 382 S.C. 276, 676 S.E.2d 690 (2009).\r\n[2] If the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection has paid\r\n  any money to any of these clients, respondent shall repay the Fund the total\r\n  amount paid on her behalf.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26944","title":"In the Matter of Michael Moore","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26944","description":"In this opinion, the Court suspended Michael Davis Moore from the practice of law for six months from the date of the opinion and imposed other requirements.","date":"2011-03-21","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter\r\n          of Michael &nbsp;Davis\r\n          Moore, Respondent.\r\n        \r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26944Â Â Â  \r\n  Submitted February 17, 2011 - Filed March\r\n21, 2011\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Erika M. Williams, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for\r\n        Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nMichael Davis Moore, of Ridgeville, pro se, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits\r\n  misconduct and consents to a confidential admonition, a public reprimand, or a definite suspension not to exceed six\r\n  months.Â  Respondent also requests that any suspension be made retroactive to\r\n  the date of his interim suspension.[1]Â \r\n  ODC does not oppose that request.Â  However, the Agreement is not conditioned\r\n  upon any suspension being retroactive to the date of interim suspension. Â We accept\r\n  the Agreement, suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for six\r\n  months, not retroactive, and impose other requirements.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement,\r\n  are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nA client retained respondent\r\n  to assist with the probate of her deceased husband's estate.Â  The employment\r\n  contract signed by respondent and the client on November 9, 2009, provided that\r\n  fees would not be less than $25,000 as a retainer.Â  The contract also provided\r\n  that respondent's time would be billed at $250 per hour, but the total fees\r\n  connected with the representation would be capped at $30,000.Â  Shortly after\r\n  the estate was opened, the client terminated the representation and retained\r\n  new counsel.Â  By letter to respondent dated January 29, 2010, new counsel\r\n  requested a full accounting and that a refund of the unearned portion of the\r\n  retainer paid by the client be issued no later than February 15, 2010.Â  The client\r\n  also requested a refund on two separate occasions.Â  Respondent failed to return\r\n  that portion of the fee not earned by respondent, failed to provide a full and\r\n  complete accounting, and failed to safely keep the client's funds in escrow\r\n  until the funds were earned by respondent.\r\nIn addition, respondent\r\n  failed to respond to a Notice of Investigation or a Treacy letter from\r\n  ODC,[2] failed to appear to respond to questions under oath as directed by ODC in a\r\n  Notice to Appear, and failed to comply with a subpoena for documents.\r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent was retained by a\r\n  client in February 2007 to file an action on the client's behalf as a result of\r\n  a land dispute.Â  Respondent was not diligent in filing the suit and failed to\r\n  keep the client reasonably informed of the status of the case.[3]Â \r\n  The case was ultimately settled.Â  On April 22, 2010, the client sent respondent\r\n  a written request for his files and related documents; however, respondent\r\n  failed to deliver the files as requested.Â  The client was able to retrieve the\r\n  files from the Attorney to Protect Clients' Interests after respondent was\r\n  placed on interim suspension.\r\nMatter III\r\nOn August 18, 2010,\r\n  respondent served a subpoena on a party in a case.Â  The subpoena was signed by\r\n  respondent as plaintiff, pro se.Â  Respondent served the subpoena\r\n  without the assistance of the clerk.Â  See Rule 45(a)(3), SCRCP (&quot;The clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise\r\n  in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall complete it before service.&nbsp;\r\n  An attorney as officer of the court may also issue and sign a subpoena on\r\n  behalf of a court in which the attorney is authorized to practice.&quot;).Â \r\n  However, at the time respondent served the subpoena, he was on interim\r\n  suspension and not allowed to practice law.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his\r\n  conduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable\r\n  diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall keep\r\n  the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter and promptly\r\n  comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer shall\r\n  deposit into a client trust account unearned legal fees and expenses that have\r\n  been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or\r\n  expenses incurred; a lawyer shall promptly deliver to a client any funds or\r\n  other property the client is entitled to receive and, upon request by the\r\n  client, promptly render a full accounting); Rule 1.16(d) (upon termination of\r\n  representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable\r\n  to protect a client's interests, including surrendering papers and property to\r\n  which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense\r\n  that has not been earned or incurred); Rule 8.1(b) (a lawyer, in connection\r\n  with a disciplinary matter, shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful\r\n  demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage\r\n  in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  \r\nRespondent also admits he has\r\n  violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR (It shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\n  professional conduct of lawyers.).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of\r\n  law in this state for six months from the date of this opinion.Â  We deny respondentâ€™s request that the suspension\r\n  be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  In addition, within\r\n  thirty days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall (1) enter into a\r\n  restitution agreement with ODC which provides for respondent's payment of\r\n  restitution in the amount of $22,500 to the client in Matter I above and (2)\r\n  enter into an agreement to pay the costs incurred in the investigation and\r\n  prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.Â  Finally,\r\n  respondent shall complete the\r\n  South Carolina Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust\r\n  Accounting School within one year of the date of this opinion.Â  Within fifteen\r\n  days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the\r\n  Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension on July\r\n  16, 2010.Â  In re Moore, 388 S.C. 278, 695 S.E.2d 853 (2010).\r\n[2] In re Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240\r\n  (1982)(A Treacy letter points out that the failure to respond to ODC\r\n  constitutes sanctionable conduct.)\r\n[3] The suit was not filed until April 2008.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26945","title":"In the Matter of Sheryl Schelin","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26945","description":"In this opinion, the Court disbars Sheryl Sisk Schelin.","date":"2011-03-21","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          In the Matter\r\n          of Sheryl Sisk Schelin, Respondent.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26945Â Â  \r\n  Submitted February 22, 2011 - Filed March\r\n21, 2011\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.

Rule 1.2\r\n  (a lawyer shall abide by a\r\n  client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and shall\r\n  consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall reasonably\r\n  consult with the client about the means by which the client's objectives are to\r\n  be accomplished, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the\r\n  matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold client funds in the lawyerâ€™s\r\n  possession in connection with a representation in a separate trust account to\r\n  be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred); Rule\r\n  1.16 (upon termination of\r\n  representation, a lawyer shall surrender papers and property to which the\r\n  client is entitled and refund any advance payment of fees or expenses that has\r\n  not been earned or incurred; the lawyer may retain papers relating to the\r\n  client to the extent permitted by other law and may retain a reasonable\r\n  nonrefundable retainer); Rule 8.1(b) (a lawyer, in\r\n  connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not knowingly fail to respond to a\r\n  lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority);

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and \r\n          Barbara M. Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia,\r\n        for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nS. Jahue Moore,Â  of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement)\r\n  pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents\r\n  to a definite suspension of up\r\n  to two years, an indefinite suspension, or disbarment, with conditions.Â  We accept\r\n  the Agreement and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for\r\n  one year, order restitution, and place conditions on his resumption of the\r\n  practice of law.Â  The facts,\r\n  as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent operated a solo\r\n  practice with an emphasis on real estate closings.Â  He contracted with Alan and\r\n  Teren Pruitt, of North American Title Company (NATC), as agent for First\r\n  American Title Insurance Company, to write title insurance for his closings and\r\n  do clerical work.Â  Neither of the Pruitts was licensed to practice law.Â  NATC\r\n  leased office space adjoining respondent's office and its administrative staff\r\n  prepared settlement statements and other closing documents for respondent's\r\n  clients under respondent's supervision.Â  \r\nRespondent also delegated to NATC\r\n  the responsibility of disbursing funds from his trust account.Â  The trust\r\n  account checks were prepared by NATC employees, who were given authority to\r\n  sign them with respondent's signature stamp.Â  Although it was the practice that\r\n  only respondent's signature would be used on trust account checks, the Pruitts\r\n  were both given signatory authority on respondent's trust account.Â  In\r\n  addition, Mr. Pruitt served as bookkeeper for respondent's law practice.Â \r\n  Respondent did not personally conduct monthly reconciliations, nor did he\r\n  adequately review monthly bank statements and reconciliations of his trust\r\n  account.\r\nIn November 2007, respondent\r\n  closed his law office as a result of the impact of the failing economy on the\r\n  real estate industry.Â  At the time, there was approximately $121,000 in one\r\n  client trust account (BB&amp;T account) and approximately $8,000 in another\r\n  (Wachovia account).Â  Respondent had an accounting of the funds in the Wachovia\r\n  account, but did not have an accurate accounting of the funds in the BB&amp;T\r\n  account.Â  In 2008, respondent changed his South Carolina Bar membership status\r\n  to inactive and moved out of state to obtain his LLM degree.\r\nWhen respondent closed his\r\n  law office, he left his client files, trust account records, blank checks, and\r\n  signature stamp with NATC.Â  He delegated to the Pruitts the responsibility of\r\n  disbursing the funds remaining in the trust accounts and issuing the remaining\r\n  title insurance policies.Â  Although respondent was in frequent telephone\r\n  contact with Mr. Pruitt, he did not review disbursement checks, trust account\r\n  records, or financial reports.\r\nIn November 2007, over 1,000\r\n  checks were written from the BB&amp;T account payable to respondent's law firm\r\n  and marked in the memo line as excess recording fees.Â  The checks totaled\r\n  approximately $21,500, which represented the positive balances on most of\r\n  respondent's client ledgers at the time; however, there is no documentation to\r\n  show respondent was entitled to those funds as excess recording fees or for any\r\n  other purposes.Â  After deposit of those funds into respondent's law firm\r\n  operating account, three checks totaling that same amount were issued from the\r\n  account to NATC.Â  This was done with respondent's signature stamp, but not with\r\n  his permission.\r\nIn April 2008, someone on\r\n  behalf of NATC used respondent's signature stamp to withdraw $110,000 from the\r\n  BB&amp;T account and deposit into an account outside respondent's control or\r\n  access.Â  At the time the funds were removed from the BB&amp;T account,\r\n  respondent had approximately $59,000 in outstanding checks dated between\r\n  January 24, 2005, and April 10, 2008.Â  As a result of the removal of the\r\n  $110,000 from the BB&amp;T account and the subsequent presentment of several\r\n  outstanding checks, the account was overdrawn and an insufficient balance\r\n  remained to cover the other outstanding checks.\r\nBecause respondent failed to\r\n  conduct monthly reconciliations or adequately review monthly bank statements\r\n  and reconciliations of the BB&amp;T account, he did not discover the removal of\r\n  the $21,500 in November 2007 or the removal of the $110,000 in April 2008.Â \r\n  Likewise, respondent did not discover the shortfall that these transactions\r\n  left in the account until notice of overdraft was sent to the Commission on\r\n  Lawyer Conduct by BB&amp;T.\r\nRespondent has taken legal\r\n  action and other steps to obtain documentation from Mr. Pruitt regarding\r\n  disbursement of the funds removed from the account and the identity of the\r\n  remaining funds.Â  However, Mr. Pruitt has not provided sufficient documentation\r\n  to verify that disbursed funds have been delivered to the appropriate payees or\r\n  to account for undisbursed funds.[1]Â \r\n  At the time of the execution of the Agreement, there remained outstanding\r\n  checks written on the BB&amp;T account, with insufficient funds on deposit to\r\n  cover them.Â  Respondent lacks the financial resources to make his account\r\n  whole, but acknowledges it is his responsibility to do so, regardless of\r\n  whether he can secure those funds from NATC or Mr. Pruitt.\r\nAt the time of the execution\r\n  of the Agreement, respondent also remained unable to account for the portion of\r\n  the funds removed from the BB&amp;T account that are not associated with\r\n  outstanding checks.Â  Respondent acknowledges it is his responsibility to\r\n  identify the clients and/or third parties to whom those funds belong and to\r\n  ensure those funds are paid, regardless of whether he can secure those funds\r\n  from NATC or Mr. Pruitt.\r\nRespondent further acknowledges\r\n  it is his responsibility to account for the $21,500 removed from the BB&amp;T\r\n  account in November 2007 as excess recording fees and that he is required to\r\n  reconcile the account, including a complete review of his settlement statements\r\n  and disbursement records, to determine what portion of those funds, if any,\r\n  must be reimbursed to clients.\r\nFinally, respondent\r\n  acknowledges it is his responsibility to locate or reconstruct the accounting\r\n  of the approximately $80,000 remaining in the Wachovia account and that he is\r\n  required to secure those funds or replace them and ensure they are\r\n  appropriately disbursed.Â  If, after due diligence, respondent is unable to\r\n  locate the payees for identified funds, he understands he must deliver those\r\n  funds in accordance with the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  27-18-10, et seq (2007 &amp; Supp. 2010).Â  If, after due\r\n  diligence, respondent is unable to identify the proper payee of funds, he\r\n  understands he must deliver those funds to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection. \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his\r\n  conduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable\r\n  diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer shall\r\n  hold property of clients that is in a lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a\r\n  representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property, in a separate account\r\n  maintained in the state where the lawyerâ€™s office is situated, and the property\r\n  shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded; complete records of\r\n  such account funds and other property shall be kept by the lawyer; a lawyer\r\n  shall comply with Rule 417, SCACR; a lawyer shall deposit into a client trust\r\n  account unearned legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be\r\n  withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred); Rule\r\n  1.16 (a lawyer may withdraw from representation of a client in certain\r\n  situations, but must take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect\r\n  a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing\r\n  time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which\r\n  the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that\r\n  has not been earned or incurred); and Rule 5.3 (a lawyer who possesses\r\n  managerial authority in a law firm must take reasonable efforts to ensure the\r\n  firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance a non-lawyer's conduct\r\n  is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer, must make\r\n  reasonable efforts to ensure the non-lawyer's conduct is compatible with the\r\n  professional obligations of the lawyer, and shall be responsible for conduct of\r\n  the non-lawyer in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if the lawyer\r\n  orders or, with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct or\r\n  knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or\r\n  mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action).Â  \r\nRespondent also admits he has\r\n  violated Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this\r\n  jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) of the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Finally, respondent acknowledges he\r\n  failed to comply with the financial recordkeeping requirements of Rule 417,\r\n  SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of\r\n  law in this state for one year from the date of this opinion.Â  Within sixty days of the date\r\n  of this opinion, respondent shall enter into a restitution plan with the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct to repay the $131,500 removed from the BB&amp;T\r\n  account.[2]Â \r\n  If, by the date of this opinion, respondent has not been able to identify the\r\n  clients for whom funds were held in trust, he will make his payments to the\r\n  Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection.Â  Should respondent return to the active\r\n  practice of law, he must notify the Commission on Lawyer Conduct in writing and\r\n  begin quarterly reporting of his trust account(s) with the Commission for a\r\n  period of two years.[3]\r\nWithin fifteen\r\n  days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the\r\n  Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  \r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent has resolved his civil lawsuit against Mr.\r\n  Pruitt with an agreement that Mr. Pruitt will provide a complete and accurate\r\n  accounting of funds.\r\n[2] The parties agree that some portion of these funds\r\n  may have been properly paid by North American Title Company or Mr. Pruitt.Â  Any\r\n  such funds may be deducted from the restitution amount upon respondent's\r\n  delivery of complete and adequate documentation to the Commission on Lawyer\r\n  Conduct.\r\n[3] Respondent has completed the Legal Ethics and\r\n  Practice Program Ethics School, which, at the time he attended, included two\r\n  hours of training on trust account management.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26947","title":"State v.

Dudek, of South\r\n  Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General DonaldÂ  J. Zelenka,\r\n  Assistant Attorney General J. Anthony Mabry, of Columbia, Solicitor Robert\r\n  Mills Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  In this capital case, a jury convicted Jeffrey Brian\r\n  Motts of murdering his cell-mate at Perry Correctional Institution.Â  Shortly\r\n  after his appellate counsel filed a notice of appeal, Motts wrote to this Court\r\n  indicating his desire to abandon his direct appeal and to waive all appellate\r\n  review of his conviction and death sentence.Â  In response, this Court remanded\r\n  the case to the circuit court to conduct a competency hearing.Â  Following a\r\n  hearing, the circuit court found Motts competent to waive his appeals.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter conducting an extensive\r\n  review of the record in this case and thoroughly questioning Motts during oral\r\n  arguments before this Court, we conclude Motts is competent to waive his right\r\n  to a direct appeal and that his waiver is knowing and voluntary.Â  Additionally,\r\n  we find that Motts's sentence of death is neither excessive nor\r\n  disproportionate with his crime.Â  Finally, we hold that neither the circuit\r\n  court nor this Court is required to issue an order for a court-appointed\r\n  psychiatrist to interview Motts, in the absence of some indicia of\r\n  incompetency, immediately prior to his execution to assure that he has remained\r\n  competent.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nIn 1997, a Spartanburg County\r\n  jury convicted Motts of the armed robbery and murder of his great-aunt and great-uncle.Â \r\n  The trial judge sentenced Motts to life imprisonment for each murder conviction\r\n  and twenty-five years' imprisonment for the armed robbery conviction.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nWhile Motts was serving his\r\n  sentences at Perry Correctional Institution in Greenville County, his\r\n  cell-mate, Charles Martin, was found dead on December 8, 2005.Â  Motts confessed\r\n  to the killing.Â  Subsequently, a Greenville County grand jury indicted Motts for\r\n  Martin's murder.Â  Based on Motts's prior murder convictions, the State sought\r\n  the death penalty.\r\nSeveral witnesses at trial,\r\n  including Motts, testified regarding the events surrounding Martin's murder.Â \r\n  Angered that Martin had lied to another inmate about Motts's involvement in\r\n  &quot;planting&quot; a knife in the inmate's cell, Motts confronted Martin\r\n  during the early morning hours of December 8, 2005.Â  According to Motts, the\r\n  verbal exchange escalated to a physical altercation with Motts hitting Martin\r\n  in the head.Â  Martin fell against the wall and started shaking.Â  Motts then picked\r\n  up Martin and bound his hands and feet using strips of cloth from his bed\r\n  sheets.Â  When Martin regained consciousness, he begged Motts not to hurt him.Â \r\n  Motts responded by choking Martin to death.Â  Because Martin continued to make\r\n  what Motts described as a &quot;death rattle,&quot; Motts proceeded to tie some\r\n  sheets around Martin's neck to stop this noise. Â Martin died as the result of\r\n  asphyxia due to strangulation.Â  Motts then pushed the body under his bed in the\r\n  cell.Â  \r\nAfter killing Martin, Motts\r\n  smoked a cigarette, ate breakfast, smoked another cigarette, and watched\r\n  television.Â  Motts then dragged Martin's body to a common area known as\r\n  &quot;the rock.&quot;Â  Before placing Martin's body on &quot;the rock,&quot; he\r\n  kicked Martin and stated &quot;this is what snitches get.&quot; \r\nMotts then reported to prison\r\n  guards that he had killed Martin.Â  After the guards found Martin's lifeless\r\n  body, officers with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division initiated an\r\n  investigation by questioning Motts.Â  During the questioning, Motts waived his Miranda[1] rights and then confessed to the murder. \r\nAfter the jury found Motts\r\n  guilty of murder, the State sought to establish the statutory aggravating\r\n  circumstance that &quot;[t]he murder was committed by a person with a prior\r\n  conviction for murder.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(2) (2003).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the State presented evidence regarding Motts's 1997 convictions for the murder\r\n  of his great-aunt and great-uncle.Â  \r\nUltimately, the jury found\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder of Martin was committed by a person\r\n  with a prior conviction for murder.Â  As a result, the jury recommended that Motts\r\n  be put to death. Â The trial judge denied all of Motts's post-trial motions and\r\n  ordered on June 4, 2008 that Motts be put to death as a result of the\r\n  conviction. \r\nThe day after sentencing,\r\n  Motts's trial counsel filed a notice of intent to appeal Motts's conviction and\r\n  sentence. Â Before any briefs were filed, Motts personally wrote to this Court\r\n  requesting that his execution proceed as scheduled.Â  Specifically, Motts\r\n  expressed his desire to relieve his appellate defender, represent himself, and\r\n  waive his direct appeal. \r\nSubsequently, this Court\r\n  issued an order remanding the matter to the trial judge, Circuit Court Judge Larry\r\n  R. Patterson, and directing him to conduct a full hearing to determine whether\r\n  Motts was competent to waive his direct appeal and whether his decision to\r\n  waive his right to direct appeal was knowing and voluntary.Â  \r\nJudge Patterson ordered that\r\n  Motts be examined by two qualified examiners designated by the South Carolina Department\r\n  of Mental Health.Â  Pursuant to the order, the examiners were to determine\r\n  whether Motts was competent under the standard enunciated in Singleton v.\r\n    State, 313 S.C. 75, 437 S.E.2d 53 (1993),[2] and followed in State v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 451 S.E.2d 883 (1994).[3]Â  \r\nThe court-appointed examiners\r\n  included:Â  Dr. Richard Frierson, a Professor of Clinical Psychiatry for the\r\n  University of South Carolina School of Medicine (USCSM); Dr. Amanda (Gowans)\r\n  Salas, Fellow in Forensic Psychiatry for the USCSM; and Dr. Michael Gassen,\r\n  Chief Psychologist for the Department of Mental Health.Â  The examiners\r\n  evaluated thirty-four-year old Motts on October 8, 2009, November 12, 2009, and\r\n  December 16, 2009.\r\nOn January 5, 2010, the\r\n  court-appointed examiners submitted a joint, fifteen-page report explaining\r\n  their ultimate conclusion that Motts was competent to waive his direct appeal\r\n  under the standard set forth in Singleton and followed in Torrence.Â  \r\nOn April 29, 2010, Circuit\r\n  Court Judge D. Garrison Hill[4] held an evidentiary hearing.Â  During the hearing, Judge Hill heard testimony\r\n  from two court-appointed psychiatrists,[5] the two trial attorneys who represented Motts in his 2007 capital trial, and\r\n  Motts. \r\nAccording to Dr. Frierson,\r\n  the examiners reviewed the following documents:Â  Motts's medical records dating\r\n  from his childhood, transcripts from Motts's criminal trials, Motts's\r\n  employment records, and Motts's records from the South Carolina Department of Corrections.Â \r\n  In addition, the examiners compiled a &quot;social history&quot; by\r\n  interviewing Motts, his mother, and an individual with a prison ministry who\r\n  had visited Motts on death row.Â  The examiners definitively concluded that\r\n  Motts was competent to waive his right to appeal and to be executed as required\r\n  under Singleton.Â  \r\nMotts's counsel called the\r\n  two attorneys who represented Motts in his 2007 capital trial.Â  Christopher\r\n  Scalzo testified that Motts expressed &quot;early on&quot; that he did not wish\r\n  for the jury to return a life sentence.Â  In fact, Scalzo had Motts evaluated to\r\n  determine whether he was competent to stand trial &quot;because of [Motts's]\r\n  initial desire to get the death penalty.&quot;Â  However, Scalzo acknowledged\r\n  that there were times when Motts was &quot;supportive of the idea of a life\r\n  sentence.&quot;Â  Scalzo recounted Motts's closing statement to the jury in\r\n  which Motts asked &quot;the jury to give him life for his family.&quot;\r\nStephen Henry, the lead\r\n  counsel appointed to Motts, testified Motts was cooperative &quot;to the point\r\n  where he thought that we might have a chance of getting a life sentence.&quot;Â \r\n  Henry stated that Motts's &quot;decision to die was made early and never\r\n  waivered.&quot;Â  As to Motts's closing statement to the jury, Henry claimed\r\n  Motts was &quot;asking for his life to be spared for his parents['] sake, not\r\n  for his own.&quot;Â  According to Henry, Motts expressed that &quot;he deserved\r\n  the death penalty for what he did.&quot;\r\nFinally, Judge Hill\r\n  personally questioned Motts.Â  During this colloquy, Motts answered questions\r\n  regarding his understanding of the competency proceedings, the appellate\r\n  proceedings, post-conviction relief proceedings, and the death sentence.Â  Motts\r\n  also stated that he deserved the death penalty and did not want to remain\r\n  incarcerated for another thirty to forty years.Â  Motts explained that he was\r\n  &quot;100 percent&quot; firm in his commitment to waive his appeals and that no\r\n  one had threatened or coerced him to reach this decision.\r\nOn June 8, 2010, Judge Hill\r\n  issued a lengthy written order in which he concluded that Motts's\r\n  &quot;decision to waive his rights to direct appeal meets the standards set forth\r\n  in Singleton v. State and that his decision is one that has been\r\n  knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made after careful and thoughtful\r\n  consideration.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\nUpon receipt of Judge Hill's\r\n  order, this Court directed Motts's appellate counsel to file a brief addressing\r\n  the issue of whether Motts is competent to waive his right to direct appeal and\r\n  whether his waiver is knowing and intelligent.Â  After the parties filed their\r\n  briefs, Motts wrote to this Court again expressing his &quot;desire to waive\r\n  all of [his] appeals, and sentence review, and not delay this any\r\n  further.&quot;Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nOur review of this case involves a three-part\r\n  analysis.Â  Initially, we must assess whether Motts is competent to waive his\r\n  direct appeal and whether this decision is knowing and voluntary.Â  If these\r\n  questions are answered in the affirmative, the question becomes whether Motts's\r\n  waiver includes this Court's proportionality review of his sentence of death.Â \r\n  Finally, we must determine whether the circuit court or this Court has a\r\n  continuing duty to assure that Motts is competent to be executed.Â \r\n  Specifically, we must consider whether Motts should be evaluated by a\r\n  court-appointed psychiatrist immediately prior to his execution.\r\nB.\r\n&quot;This Court is charged\r\n  with the responsibility of issuing a notice authorizing the execution of a\r\n  person who has been duly convicted in a court of law and sentenced to\r\n  death.&quot;Â  Hill v. State, 377 S.C. 462, 467, 661 S.E.2d 92, 95\r\n  (2008).Â  &quot;We will issue an execution notice after the defendant has\r\n  exhausted all appeals and other avenues of PCR in state and federal courts, or\r\n  after that person, who is determined by this Court to be mentally competent,\r\n  knowingly and voluntarily waives such appeals.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;When considering a\r\n  request by an appellant who has been sentenced to death to waive the right to\r\n  appeal or pursue PCR, and to be executed forthwith, it has been our practice to\r\n  remand the matter to circuit court for a hearing and ruling on whether the\r\n  appellant is mentally competent to make such a waiver, and whether any waiver\r\n  of appellate or PCR rights is knowing and voluntary.&quot;Â  Hughes v. State,\r\n  367 S.C. 389, 395, 626 S.E.2d 805, 808Â  (2006).Â  &quot;We remand such a matter\r\n  when we deem it necessary to further develop or explore the facts of a\r\n  case.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Following that competency hearing, the parties\r\n  are required by this Court to file briefs and an appendix containing the\r\n  testimony and evidence considered by the circuit court.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;The appellant is required, when directed by the Court, to appear at oral\r\n  argument and personally respond to questions regarding the waiver of his\r\n  appellate or PCR rights.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;In making a\r\n  determination on the competency of a convicted defendant to waive his appellate\r\n  or PCR rights, we are not bound by the circuit court's findings or rulings,\r\n  although we recognize the circuit court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses,\r\n  is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative\r\n  weight to their testimony.&quot;Â  State v. Downs, 369 S.C. 55, 66, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 79, 84 (2006).Â  \r\nIn deciding the issue of a\r\n  capital defendant's competency, this Court carefully and thoroughly reviews the\r\n  following: Â the defendant's history of mental competency; the existence and\r\n  present status of mental illness or disease suffered by the defendant, if any,\r\n  as shown in the record of previous proceedings and in the competency hearing;\r\n  the testimony and opinions of mental health experts who have examined the\r\n  defendant; the findings of the circuit court that conducted a competency\r\n  hearing; the arguments of counsel; and the capital defendant's demeanor and\r\n  personal responses to the Court's questions at oral argument regarding the\r\n  waiver of appellate or PCR rights.Â  Reed v. Ozmint, 374 S.C. 19, 24, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 209, 211-12 (2007).Â  &quot;We necessarily decide each case on an\r\n  individual basis, and it is within our discretion whether to allow an appellant\r\n  to waive his appellate or PCR rights.&quot;Â  Hughes, 367 S.C. at 397,\r\n  626 S.E.2d at 809.\r\nThe standard for determining\r\n  whether an appellant or PCR applicant is mentally competent to waive the right\r\n  to a direct appeal or PCR is set forth in Singleton v. State, 313 S.C.\r\n  75, 437 S.E.2d 53 (1993).Â  Singleton provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    first prong is the cognitive prong which can be defined as:Â  whether a\r\n    convicted defendant can understand the nature of the proceedings, what he or\r\n    she was tried for, the reason for the punishment, or the nature of the\r\n    punishment.Â  The second prong is the assistance prong which can be defined as:Â \r\n    whether the convicted defendant possesses sufficient capacity or ability to\r\n    rationally communicate with counsel.\r\n\r\nId. at 84, 437 S.E.2d at 58.Â  &quot;This standard of\r\n  competency is the same standard required before a convicted defendant may be\r\n  executed.&quot;Â  Hughes, 367 S.C. at 397-98, 626 S.E.2d at 809.Â \r\n  &quot;The failure of either prong is sufficient to warrant a stay of execution\r\n  and a denial of the convicted defendant's motion to waive his right to appeal\r\n  or pursue PCR.&quot;Â  Id. at 398, 626 S.E.2d at 809.\r\nApplying the foregoing to the\r\n  facts of the instant case, we conclude the evidence in the record fully\r\n  supports Judge Hill's decision finding that Motts is competent to waive his\r\n  right to direct appeal and this waiver has been made knowingly and voluntarily.\r\n  Â Â \r\nNotably, the three\r\n  court-appointed examiners unanimously agreed that Motts met the Singleton standard.Â  In their written report, the experts found Motts understood that a\r\n  jury had convicted him for the death of Martin and that a judge had sentenced\r\n  him to death.Â  According to the experts, Motts also &quot;verbalized a basic\r\n  understanding&quot; of the appellate process and PCR.Â  The experts further opined\r\n  that Motts &quot;possesses sufficient capacity or ability to rationally\r\n  communicate with counsel.&quot; \r\nDespite Motts's lifelong\r\n  mental health issues, the experts concluded that &quot;Motts is not evidencing\r\n  current symptoms of mental illness or other deficits that would significantly\r\n  compromise his present capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings,\r\n  the reason or nature of the punishment, or his ability to rationally\r\n  communicate with counsel.&quot;Â  Although Motts experienced bouts of major\r\n  depression, Dr. Frierson found that he was currently in &quot;full\r\n  remission.&quot;Â  Neither Dr. Frierson nor Dr. Salas believed that Motts's\r\n  decision to waive his direct appeal was a product of depression or that it\r\n  constituted a desire to commit suicide.\r\nAt the competency hearing,\r\n  Drs. Frierson and Salas testified that their opinion regarding Motts's\r\n  competency had not changed even after interviewing Motts the day of the\r\n  hearing.Â  Drs. Frierson and Salas also informed Judge Hill that the medications\r\n  Motts was currently taking did not affect his cognitive abilities.\r\nJudge Hill and this Court also\r\n  thoroughly questioned Motts.Â  In response to these questions, Motts was able to\r\n  articulate his understanding of his murder conviction and death sentence, the\r\n  competency proceedings, the appellate proceedings, and the PCR proceedings.Â \r\n  Motts also stated that he deserved the death penalty and explained that he did\r\n  not want to remain incarcerated for the next thirty to forty years.Â  Finally,\r\n  Motts explained that he was firm in his commitment to waive his appeals and\r\n  that no one had threatened or coerced him to reach this decision.\r\nC.\r\nHaving affirmed Judge Hill's\r\n  ruling, the next step in our analysis is to review Motts's sentence of death.\r\nBecause there is a conflict\r\n  in our jurisprudence as to whether a capital defendant may waive this Court's\r\n  review of his sentence, we take this opportunity to definitively resolve this\r\n  issue. \r\nIn State v. Torrence,\r\n  322 S.C. 475, 473 S.E.2d 703 (1996) (Torrence III), this Court found\r\n  Torrence was competent and his decision to waive his direct appeal of a capital\r\n  re-sentencing was knowing and voluntary.[6]Â \r\n  The Court then considered the question of &quot;whether the [sentence] review\r\n  provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985)&quot; could also be waived by Torrence.Â  Id. at 479, 473 S.E.2d at 706.Â  Recognizing that both constitutional and\r\n  statutory rights may be waived, the Court concluded that Torrence could waive\r\n  the review provisions of section 16-3-25.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nSix years after Torrence III, this Court reached a different conclusion.Â  In State v. Passaro,\r\n  350 S.C. 499, 567 S.E.2d 862 (2002), the defendant pleaded guilty to capital\r\n  murder and was sentenced to death.Â  Subsequently, Passaro sought to waive his\r\n  appeal.Â  After concluding that Passaro could waive his right to general\r\n  appellate review, this Court proceeded to review his sentence under section\r\n  16-3-25(C).Â  In a footnote, the Court stated &quot;[w]e have never directly\r\n  addressed whether a defendant may waive sentence review under section 16-3-25(C)\r\n  (1976).&quot;Â  Id. at 508 n.11, 567 S.E.2d at 867 n.11.Â  The Court,\r\n  however, declined to address this issue as it was neither raised nor briefed by\r\n  either party.Â  Id.\r\nSection 16-3-25, the\r\n  provision that addresses capital-sentencing proceedings, provides in pertinent\r\n  part: Â &quot;The sentence review shall be in addition to direct appeal, if taken, and the review and appeal\r\n  shall be consolidated for consideration. Â The court shall render its decision\r\n  on all legal errors, the factual substantiation of the verdict, and the\r\n  validity of the sentence.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(F) (2003)\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nAs we interpret section\r\n  16-3-25, the General Assembly contemplated a defendant's waiver of a direct\r\n  appeal; however, it made no such provision as to this Court's mandatory\r\n  sentence review.Â  Although Motts is entitled to waive his personal right to a\r\n  direct appeal, we hold that he cannot waive this Court's statutorily-imposed\r\n  duty to review his capital sentence.Â  See State v. Shaw, 273 S.C.\r\n  194, 209, 255 S.E.2d 799, 806 (1979) (holding South Carolina's statutory\r\n  death-penalty procedure is constitutional and recognizing that &quot;[t]he duty\r\n  falls to this Court&quot; to ensure that a sentence of death must conform to\r\n  the statutory requirements), overruled on other grounds by State v.\r\n    Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nBased on our conclusion that\r\n  it is this Court's statutorily-imposed duty to conduct a proportionality review\r\n  of a capital sentence, we turn now to a review of Motts's sentence.[7]Â  \r\n&quot;The United States\r\n  Constitution prohibits the imposition of the death penalty when it is either\r\n  excessive or disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 28, 596 S.E.2d 475, 482 (2004).Â  In conducting a\r\n  proportionality review, we search for similar cases in which the sentence of\r\n  death has been upheld.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E) (2003) (providing\r\n  that in conducting a sentence review the Supreme Court &quot;shall include in\r\n  its decision a reference to those similar cases which it took into\r\n  consideration&quot;).\r\nAfter reviewing the entire\r\n  record, we find the sentence of death was not the result of passion, prejudice,\r\n  or any other arbitrary factor, and the jury's finding of a statutory\r\n  aggravating circumstance for the murder is supported by the evidence.Â  As\r\n  evidenced by Motts's own testimony and confession, Motts violently murdered\r\n  Martin and appeared to have little remorse for his actions.Â  Despite Martin's\r\n  pleas for his life, Motts strangled Martin to death.Â  Seemingly unaffected by\r\n  the heinousness of his actions, Motts smoked cigarettes, ate breakfast, and\r\n  watched television after he killed Martin.Â  Motts then callously displayed\r\n  Martin's lifeless body in a common area in order to send a message to the other\r\n  inmates. Â \r\nFurthermore, a review of\r\n  prior cases establishes that the death sentence in this case is proportionate\r\n  to that in similar cases and is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the\r\n  crime.Â  See State v. Lindsey, 372 S.C. 185, 642 S.E.2d 557 (2007)\r\n  (holding death sentence based on single aggravating circumstance and single\r\n  victim was not disproportionate to penalty imposed in other death penalty\r\n  cases); State v. Atkins, 303 S.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d 760 (1990) (affirming\r\n  defendant's murder convictions and sentence of death where jury found sole\r\n  statutory aggravating circumstance that victim's murder was committed by a\r\n  person with a prior conviction of murder).\r\nD.\r\nFinally, we consider the\r\n  issues raised by Motts's appellate counsel.Â  In his brief, Motts's counsel\r\n  argues that the circuit court and this Court have a continuing duty to assure\r\n  that Motts remains competent once Motts is served with a notice of execution.Â  Because\r\n  Motts has suffered from major depression, counsel contends that Motts's\r\n  competency is not static.Â  If Motts's mental health issues return, counsel is\r\n  concerned that Motts will no longer maintain an attorney-client relationship.Â \r\n  In the event that scenario occurs, counsel asserts he will not be able to assess\r\n  whether Motts has remained competent prior to execution.Â  Given the claimed fluidity\r\n  of Motts's competency, counsel argues that Judge Hill erred in ruling he did\r\n  not have authority to order that a court-appointed psychiatrist examine Motts\r\n  prior to his execution.Â  In the alternative, counsel claims this Court should\r\n  order the evaluation. \r\nAt the competency hearing,\r\n  Motts's counsel raised this issue through his arguments to the court and\r\n  questioning of Drs. Frierson and Salas. Â During cross-examination, Dr. Frierson\r\n  acknowledged that &quot;competency can change over time.&quot;Â  He explained\r\n  that he could not guarantee that Motts's depressive symptoms would not return\r\n  within a few months and believed that such a change was &quot;always\r\n  possible.&quot;Â  Dr. Frierson admitted that Motts should be evaluated by a\r\n  psychiatrist prior to his execution in order to ensure that Motts remained\r\n  competent.\r\nDr. Salas agreed with Dr.\r\n  Frierson's opinion.Â  She also believed it would be a &quot;good idea&quot; for\r\n  a psychiatrist to evaluate Motts after the notice of execution because\r\n  &quot;competency can change and there are some factors that we know have an\r\n  impact over competency such as a mood component where . . . major depressive\r\n  disorder . . . can come back in time.&quot; Â She further stated that &quot;it\r\n  would be important for competency to be [evaluated] as close to the time&quot;\r\n  of execution. \r\nÂ In his\r\n  order, Judge Hill denied Motts's counsel's request to have Motts re-evaluated\r\n  immediately prior to his execution.Â  Judge Hill explained that the request was\r\n  &quot;beyond the scope of the matter this court was directed to address by the\r\n  Supreme Court in the remand order.&quot;Â  However, he noted that counsel could\r\n  present this request to this Court.Â  \r\nAfter careful consideration,\r\n  we find that neither the circuit court nor this Court is required to issue an\r\n  order for a court-appointed psychiatrist to interview Motts, in the absence of\r\n  some indicia of incompetency, immediately prior to his execution to assure that\r\n  he has remained competent.Â  \r\nInitially, we find that Judge\r\n  Hill did not err in declining to order the requested evaluation as this was\r\n  clearly outside the parameters of our remand order.Â  As will be discussed, we\r\n  find this Court's competency proceedings and the general procedural avenue of\r\n  section 17-27-20 of the South Carolina Code should effectively alleviate\r\n  Motts's counsel's concern that an incompetent inmate will be executed.\r\nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits the State from executing\r\n  an incompetent individual.Â  Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986); Council\r\n    v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 597 S.E.2d 782 (2004); Singleton, 313 S.C.\r\n  at 79, 437 S.E.2d at 56.Â  In Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930 (2007),\r\n  the United States Supreme Court reiterated the holding in Ford and explained:\r\n\r\n  The prohibition applies despite a prisoner's earlier competency to\r\n    be held responsible for committing a crime and to be tried for it. Prior findings of\r\n    competency do not foreclose a prisoner from proving he is incompetent to be\r\n    executed because of his present mental condition. Â Under Ford, once a\r\n    prisoner makes the requisite preliminary showing that his current mental state\r\n    would bar his execution, the Eighth Amendment, applicable to the States\r\n    under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, entitles him to an\r\n    adjudication to determine his condition. Â These determinations are governed by\r\n    the substantive federal baseline for competency set down in Ford. \r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  934-35.\r\nIn assessing a defendant's competency, this Court has\r\n  recognized that there is a presumption of continued competency once a judicial\r\n  determination of a defendant's competency has been established.Â  See State\r\n    v. Drayton, 270 S.C. 582, 243 S.E.2d 458 (1978) (holding failure of trial\r\n  judge to order further examination and a hearing to determine defendant's\r\n  competency to stand trial did not violate statute authorizing trial judge to\r\n  order such examinations nor deprive defendant of due process where previous\r\n  presiding judge had found, about two and a half months prior, that defendant\r\n  was fit to stand trial and there were no additional facts to warrant further\r\n  examination or hearing).[8]\r\nAlthough Drayton involved a determination of a\r\n  defendant's competency to stand trial, we believe it provides guidance in the\r\n  instant case regarding Motts's competency to be executed. Â Cf. State\r\n    v. Finklea, 388 S.C. 379, 384 n.2, 697 S.E.2d 543, 546 n.2 (2010)\r\n  (distinguishing Singleton standard for competency from standard required\r\n  to stand trial; stating Singleton standard &quot;requires only that a party understand they have been sentenced to death for murder and be\r\n  able to communicate rationally with counsel&quot; (emphasis added) (citation omitted)); Lonchar v. Thomas, 58 F.3d 588, 589 (11th Cir. 1995) (concluding\r\n  &quot;next friend&quot; lacked standing to bring petition for habeas corpus on\r\n  behalf of prisoner facing execution and recognizing that &quot;a presumption of\r\n  continued competency arises from a prior finding of competency&quot;).\r\nBecause this Court is responsible for the final\r\n  determination of an inmate's competency to be executed, it has consistently\r\n  questioned each inmate personally with respect to their continued competency\r\n  and decision to waive any further appellate proceedings regarding their\r\n  conviction and capital sentence.Â  Hill v. State, 377 S.C. 462, 661\r\n  S.E.2d 92 (2008); Reed v. Ozmint, 374 S.C. 19, 647 S.E.2d 209 (2007); Hughes\r\n    v. State, 367 S.C. 389, 626 S.E.2d 805 (2006); State v. Passaro, 350\r\n  S.C. 499, 567 S.E.2d 862 (2002); State v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 451\r\n  S.E.2d 883 (1994).Â Â  \r\nIf the Court determines that the inmate is competent,\r\n  it can affirm the circuit court's ruling and order that the inmate's execution\r\n  be carried out in accordance with section 17-25-370 of the South Carolina Code,\r\n  which provides that a death sentence be carried out on the fourth Friday after\r\n  the Commissioner of the prison system is notified of the final disposition.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-370 (2003). Â Thus, there is a relatively short delay\r\n  between the Court's determination that an inmate is competent to be executed\r\n  and the actual date of execution.\r\nIn the event an inmate\r\n  alleges he is incompetent after an order of execution is issued by this Court,\r\n  the inmate may apply for PCR on the basis of competency, pursuant to section\r\n  17-27-20(a)(6) of the South Carolina Code.[9]Â \r\n  Subsequently, an evidentiary hearing would be held at which the inmate would be\r\n  required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he lacks the requisite\r\n  competency for execution.Â  If the PCR court finds the applicant incompetent,\r\n  and this Court agrees, a stay of execution would be issued.Â  If the inmate\r\n  becomes competent, then the State would have to move for a hearing before the\r\n  PCR judge in order to lift the stay of execution.\r\nAdditionally, if the Court has reason to believe that\r\n  the inmate is incompetent, it can then issue a stay of execution pursuant to a\r\n  &quot;Singleton writ.&quot;Â  See Singleton, 313 S.C. at 84,\r\n  437 S.E.2d at 58 (finding failure of either prong of the two-part competency\r\n  test is sufficient to warrant a stay of execution).\r\nAs a final note, if Motts's counsel's argument is\r\n  taken to its logical extreme, it would mean that a defendant's competency must\r\n  continue to be evaluated up to the moment of execution.Â  Not only is an\r\n  application of this interpretation impractical, it has been rejected by a few\r\n  jurisdictions.Â  See John E. Theuman, Annotation, Propriety of Carrying\r\n    Out Death Sentences Against Mentally Ill Individuals, 111 A.L.R.5th 491, Â§\r\n  5 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2010) (discussing cases that have adjudicated whether the\r\n  Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment rule prohibiting execution of the\r\n  insane requires a determination of sanity at the exact time of execution). Â \r\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has provided a\r\n  well-reasoned explanation for rejecting this interpretation.Â  In Coe v. Bell,\r\n  209 F.3d 815 (6th Cir. 2000), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals assessed whether\r\n  the procedures followed by Tennessee state courts in determining whether a\r\n  capital defendant's competency to be executed satisfied due process. Â In that\r\n  case, Coe's murder conviction and sentence of death were affirmed on direct\r\n  appeal.Â  Subsequently, the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld a determination that\r\n  Coe was competent to be executed.Â  In his habeas corpus petition, Coe argued\r\n  that &quot;the Tennessee courts erred in deciding his competency to be executed\r\n  because they evaluated his present competency rather than determining his\r\n  future competency at the moment of execution.&quot;Â  Id. at 824.Â \r\n  Because Coe suffered from Dissociative Identity Disorder, which caused him to\r\n  dissociate under stress, he claimed he would dissociate as his execution approached\r\n  and would not have the requisite competency at the time of his execution.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n  In rejecting Coe's argument, the Sixth Circuit\r\n    reiterated the United States Supreme Court's holding in Ford and stated:\r\n    \r\n    We do not believe that the Supreme Court in Ford meant to\r\n    require a state to determine a prisoner's competency at the exact time of his\r\n    execution. Â It would be impossible to follow the procedural protections\r\n    identified in the opinions of Justice Marshall and Justice Powell in a\r\n    meaningful way in the moments before execution; a state could not make a sound\r\n    decision in accordance with due process regarding a prisoner's competency to be\r\n    executed at this time. Â Nevertheless, a state must make its determination when\r\n    execution is imminent. See Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637,\r\n    644-45, 118 S. Ct. 1618, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998). Â Whether the competency\r\n    determination is made in the week or the month before the prisoner's scheduled\r\n    execution, the state is entitled to exercise discretion in creating its own\r\n    procedures &quot;[a]s long as basic fairness is\r\n    observed.&quot;Â  Ford, 477 U.S. at 427, 106 S. Ct. 2595 (Powell, J.,\r\n    concurring).\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  824-25.\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we believe this Court's procedures concerning an inmate's competency\r\n  to be executed comply with the intent of Ford.Â  By remanding to the\r\n  circuit court for a competency hearing, this Court acquires an extensive\r\n  evidentiary record regarding an inmate's mental health history as well as a\r\n  judicial determination as to an inmate's competency.Â  If the Court then\r\n  personally questions an inmate, it is able to evaluate an inmate's competency\r\n  shortly before the execution date.Â  In the event an inmate becomes incompetent\r\n  prior to execution, there is a PCR avenue available that could potentially\r\n  result in a stay of execution.\r\nIII. CONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, we\r\n  affirm the circuit court's decision finding Motts competent to waive his direct\r\n  appeal and that this waiver is knowing and voluntary.Â  After conducting our\r\n  statutorily-imposed duty to review Motts's capital sentence, we also affirm the\r\n  sentence of death.Â  Finally, given this Court's procedures and the PCR avenues\r\n  available to Motts, we conclude that neither the circuit court nor this Court\r\n  is required to order that a court-appointed psychiatrist interview Motts\r\n  immediately prior to his execution in the\r\n  absence of some indicia of incompetency.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Miranda v.

Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 451\r\n  S.E.2d 883 (1994) (recognizing that the Singleton test was to be applied\r\n  to a determination of whether a capital defendant was competent to waive\r\n  appellate proceedings).\r\n[4] Â While the examination was being conducted, Judge\r\n  Patterson retired from the bench.Â  Pursuant to the State's request, this Court\r\n  issued an order naming Circuit Court Judge D. Garrison Hill as the replacement\r\n  judge and granted him the authority to perform those duties specified in the\r\n  original remand order.\r\n[5] Â Neither the State nor Motts's counsel called Dr.\r\n  Michael Gassen.Â  The written report and the testimony, however, established\r\n  that Dr. Gassen concurred with the opinions of the two testifying examiners.\r\n[6]Â  Torrence was the third opinion in a series of\r\n  appeals.Â  In State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (Torrence I), this Court affirmed Torrence's convictions but reversed his sentence of\r\n  death and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding. Â After Torrence was\r\n  re-sentenced to death, he sought to waive his appeal.Â  Subsequently, this Court\r\n  remanded to the circuit court for a competency hearing and development of a\r\n  full record.Â  State v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 451 S.E.2d 883 (1994) (Torrence II).Â Â  Torrence then moved to dismiss the appeal of the circuit court's\r\n  decision finding him competent to waive his appeal.\r\n[7]Â  See S.C. Code Ann.

Robinson, 383 U.S. 375\r\n  (1966), for the proposition that the circuit court &quot;had the inherent authority\r\n  to order any steps it found necessary to assure [Motts] was competent prior to\r\n  his execution.&quot;Â  The Court in Drayton found Drope and Pate were inapposite given the defendants in those cases had never received a mental\r\n  examination to determine competency.Â  Drayton, 270 S.C. at 585, 243\r\n  S.E.2d at 459.Â  Here, as in Drayton, Motts has received a judicial\r\n  determination of competency.Â  Thus, we find that neither Drope nor Pate support counsel's argument.\r\n[9]Â  S.C.

Blackwell-Selim, 385 S.C. 394, 684 S.E.2d\r\n  208 (Ct. App. 2009). Â We\r\n  grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, dispense with further briefing,\r\n  vacate the opinion of the Court of Appeals, and remand to the circuit court to\r\n  make specific findings of fact.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\nPetitioner pled\r\n  guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the stabbing death of her live-in\r\n  boyfriend.Â  She was sentenced to twenty yearsâ€™ imprisonment. During sentencing,\r\n  petitioner presented evidence seeking to show a history of criminal domestic\r\n  violence suffered by her at the hands of the decedent, entitling her to early\r\n  parole eligibility pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-90 (Supp. 2010).Â  After\r\n  sentencing petitioner to twenty yearsâ€™ imprisonment, the plea judge stated, â€œThere\r\n  is no finding of parole eligibility pursuant to Â§ 16-25-90;â€ however, he made\r\n  no specific findings of fact as to why petitioner was ineligible for early\r\n  parole.Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed the plea judgeâ€™s finding as to early parole eligibility.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals concluded the record supported a determination that petitioner\r\n  failed to produce credible evidence of a history of criminal domestic violence at\r\n  the hands of the decedent and failed to satisfy the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence standard.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of\r\n  Appeals err in affirming the plea judgeâ€™s finding that petitioner was\r\n  ineligible for early parole?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn criminal\r\n  cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by\r\n  factual findings of the trial court unless an abuse of discretion is shown. Â State\r\n    v. Laney, 367 S.C. 639, 643, 627 S.E.2d 726, 729 (2006).Â  The appellate court\r\n  does not reevaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by\r\n  any evidence.Â  State v. Winkler, 388 S.C. 574, 583, 698 S.E.2d 596, 601\r\n  (2010).\r\nPursuant to Â§ 16-25-90,\r\n  a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense against a household\r\n  member is eligible for parole after serving one-fourth of his or her prison\r\n  term if the person presents credible evidence of a history of criminal domestic\r\n  violence, as defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-20 (2003), suffered at the hands\r\n  of the household member.Â  Such\r\n  a history must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  State v.\r\n    Grooms, 343 S.C. 248, 254, 540 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2000). Â Therefore, mere\r\n  production of evidence does not automatically result in earlier parole\r\n  eligibility; instead, the defendant must persuade the judge by presenting proof which leads the trier of fact to\r\n  find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its\r\n  nonexistence.Â  Id. at 253-54, 540 S.E.2d at 101-02 (citing 2 McCormick on Evidence Â§ 339 (5th ed. 1999)).Â  Moreover, use of the term â€œcredible\r\n  evidenceâ€ indicates the legislature intended the defendantâ€™s evidence to be, in\r\n  fact, trustworthy, not simply plausible.Â  Id. at 253, 540 S.E.2d at\r\n  101.Â  The defendant must persuade the judge her evidence is reliable.Â  Id.\r\nWe find the Court\r\n  of Appeals erred in reviewing the plea judgeâ€™s finding petitioner was not eligible\r\n  for early parole under Â§ 16-25-90 because the plea judge failed to make\r\n  specific findings of fact to support his ruling.Â  Thus, there was nothing for\r\n  the Court of Appeals to review.Â  Winkler, 388 S.C. at 583, 698 S.E.2d at 601; Laney, 367 S.C. at 643, 627 S.E.2d at 729.Â  The circuit court must make specific findings in ruling on parole\r\n  eligibility or ineligibility under\r\n  Â§ 16-25-90.Â  See e.g. Grooms, 343 S.C. 248, 540 S.E.2d 99.Â  Therefore, we vacate the opinion of the\r\n  Court of Appeals and remand the matter to the circuit court to make specific findings\r\n  of fact regarding the ruling that petitioner was not entitled to early parole\r\n  eligibility pursuant to Â§ 16-25-90. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the plea\r\n  judge failed to make specific findings of fact with regard to his ruling that\r\n  petitioner was not entitled to early parole eligibility pursuant to Â§ 16-25-90,\r\n  we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, dispense with further briefing,\r\n  vacate the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion, and remand the case to circuit court to\r\n  make such findings. \r\nVACATED and\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, and KITTREDGE JJ., concur.\r\nHEARN, J., not\r\n  participating.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26949","title":"Evening Post v.

Â In 1997, Dr. J. Chester Floyd was hired by the Board as Superintendent\r\n  for School District.Â  Pursuant to a Professional Employment Agreement executed\r\n  in 2005 between Floyd and School District, Floyd was hired through June 2010.Â \r\n  A provision of this contract required the Board to evaluate Floyd at least once\r\n  a year. This evaluation was the basis for determining, among other things,\r\n  whether Floyd received a 5% increase in his compensation.\r\nIn 2006, the composition of\r\n  the Board changed after an election resulting in the defeat of three longtime\r\n  incumbents.Â  After this election, the Board became more critical of the Superintendent,\r\n  with most decisions being rendered 5 to 4.Â  It was in the midst of this contentious\r\n  environment that the present action was filed by Evening Post to obtain\r\n  information about the Board.\r\nDuring Floyd's evaluation for\r\n  the 2006-2007 school year, the law firm of Childs and Halligan, PA, became\r\n  involved at the request of Frank Wright, Chairman of the Board. Childs and\r\n  Halligan prepared a summary of each individual Board member's answers to both a\r\n  written questionnaire and a telephone interview concerning Floydâ€™s performance.\r\n  Â The Board met in executive session to discuss Floyd's performance under the\r\n  agreement, and after the session, Wright publicly announced the Board found\r\n  Floyd's performance to be satisfactory, entitling Floyd to the 5% pay increase.\r\nEvening Post, after\r\n  discovering information regarding the written questionnaire and telephone interview,\r\n  wrote to Floyd on two separate occasions requesting access to certain documents\r\n  pursuant to FOIA.Â  Floyd denied both requests, stating the evaluations were\r\n  exempt from disclosure under FOIA pursuant to the attorney-client privilege.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, Evening Post requested access to these items a third time, but\r\n  directed its request to the Board. Â Wright responded to this third request,\r\n  denying it on the same grounds as Floyd, but adding that the personal privacy\r\n  exemption under FOIA also applied to the evaluations. \r\nEvening Post filed a lawsuit\r\n  pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, alleging that the evaluations\r\n  were public records, the School District's denial of access to the public\r\n  records violated FOIA, and School District should be enjoined from violating\r\n  FOIA.Â  Evening Post asked, in the alternative, that the circuit court review\r\n  the evaluations in camera to determine if they were public records and\r\n  whether the exemptions claimed by School District were applicable.Â  School District\r\n  filed a timely answer, asserting as an affirmative defense that the records\r\n  sought were exempt from disclosure under FOIA, specifically Section\r\n  30-4-40(a)(7) of the South Carolina Code (2007) and attaching the affidavits of\r\n  Wright and Kathryn Long Mahoney, a Childs and Halligan attorney.Â  In\r\n  conjunction with its answer, School District filed a motion for judgment on the\r\n  pleadings. \r\nDuring the pendency of School\r\n  District's motion, Evening Post submitted interrogatories and document\r\n  production requests to School District. Â While School District responded to the\r\n  interrogatories, School District objected to the production request for a blank\r\n  copy of the questionnaire referenced in Wright's affidavit on the ground of\r\n  attorney-client privilege. Evening Post filed a motion to compel pursuant to\r\n  Rule 37, SCRCP, in order to gain access to the questionnaire. Both Evening\r\n  Post's Rule 37 motion and School District's Rule 12(c) motion were scheduled to\r\n  be heard the same day. \r\nPrior to the hearing, School\r\n  District submitted a set of sealed documents to the circuit court for an in\r\n    camera review, which the circuit court accepted.Â  The documents submitted\r\n  were:Â  (1) Correspondence from Daryl T.\r\n  Hawkins (Floyd's lawyer) to Wright; (2) a memorandum from Childs and Halligan\r\n  to Board Members; (3) a blank copy of the written questionnaire attached to the\r\n  above memorandum; and (4) a compilation prepared by Childs and Halligan of\r\n  information from questionnaires and telephone interviews.Â  School District did\r\n  not submit the completed questionnaires to the circuit court. Â Because the circuit court considered matters outside\r\n  the pleadings in conjunction with School District's Rule 12(c) motion, the\r\n  circuit court treated the matter as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56,\r\n  SCRCP. Â After taking the matter under advisement, the circuit court granted\r\n  summary judgment to School District and denied Evening Post's motion to compel.\r\n  Â Evening Post appealed to the court of appeals and the case was certified to\r\n  this Court pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.\r\nÂ Â  ISSUES\r\nEvening Post raises two\r\n  issues on appeal:\r\n1.Did the circuit court err in\r\n  granting summary judgment to School District on the FOIA claim?\r\n2. Did the circuit court err in\r\n  denying Evening Post's motion to compel production of the blank questionnaire? \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Summary Judgment Motion\r\nEvening Post contends summary\r\n  judgment was erroneously granted because the attorneys were only hired as a\r\n  means to insulate the Board from FOIA compliance, and the circuit court should\r\n  have allowed Evening Post an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery.Â  School\r\n  District argues in response that it met its burden to prove the exemption\r\n  applies.Â  We hold the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor\r\n  of School District. \r\nWhen reviewing the trial\r\n  court's decision to grant summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard applied by the circuit court.Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue\r\n    Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).&nbsp;\r\n  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact\r\n  such that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.&nbsp;\r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP;see also Hancock v.\r\n    Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C.\r\n  326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009) (&quot;[I]n cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion\r\n  for summary judgment.&quot;). Â &quot;In determining whether any triable issues\r\n  of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party.&quot;Â  David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242,\r\n  247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006). Â Because summary judgment is a drastic remedy, it\r\n  must not be granted until the opposing party has had a &quot;full and fair opportunity\r\n  to complete discovery.&quot; Â Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580\r\n  S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003).Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate where further\r\n  inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of\r\n  the law.Â  Lanham, 349 S.C. at 362, 563 S.E.2d at 333.\r\nFOIA is remedial in nature\r\n  and should be liberally construed to carry out its purpose.

City of Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 156, 161, 547 S.E.2d 862, 864-65\r\n  (2001).Â  As the General Assembly stated, \r\n\r\n  [I]t is\r\n    vital in a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and\r\n    public manner so that citizens shall be advised of the performance of public\r\n    officials and of the decisions that are reached in public activity and in the\r\n    formulation of public policy.Â  Toward this end, provisions of this chapter must\r\n    be construed so as to make it possible for citizens, or their representatives, to\r\n    learn and report fully the activities of their public officials at a minimum\r\n    cost or delay to the persons seeking access to public documents or meetings.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Â§ 30-4-30(a).Â  This right is not without some exceptions,\r\n  enumerated under section 30-4-40, the following being the one at issue in this\r\n  case: &quot;Correspondence or work products of legal counsel for a public body\r\n  and any other material that would violate attorney-client relationships.&quot; Â Id. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(7).Â  The determination of whether documents or portions thereof\r\n  are exempt from FOIA must be made on a case-by-case basis, and the exempt and\r\n  non-exempt material shall be separated and the nonexempt material disclosed.Â  City\r\n    of Columbia v. ACLU, 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1996); see\r\n      also Beattie v. Aiken County Depâ€™t of Social Servs., 319 S.C. 449, 453, 462\r\n  S.E.2d 276, 279 (1995); Newberry Publ'g Co., Inc. v. Newberry County Commâ€™n\r\n    on Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse, 308 S.C. 352, 354, 417 S.E.2d 870, 872\r\n  (1992).Â  However, the exemptions should be narrowly construed to not provide a\r\n  blanket prohibition of disclosure in order to &quot;guarantee the public\r\n  reasonable access to certain activities of the government.&quot;Â  See Fowler v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 463, 468, 472 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1996); see\r\n    also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-15 (2007). The\r\n  burden of proving that an exemption exists lies with the government.Â  Evening\r\n    Post Publ'g Co. v. City of North Charleston, 363 S.C. 452, 457, 611 S.E.2d\r\n  496, 499 (2005). \r\nThe circuit court stated in\r\n  its order that an in camera review was held, but for only three out of\r\n  the five items the circuit court claimed Evening Post requested.[1]Â \r\n  No indication is given in the order or the record why only three of the items\r\n  were reviewed by the circuit court.Â  In addition, the circuit court did not\r\n  even see the documents ultimately sought by Evening Post in the lawsuitâ€”the Board\r\n  Members' completed questionnaires.Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate where\r\n  further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the\r\n  application of the law.Â  Lanham, 349 S.C. at 362, 563 S.E.2d at 333. Â We\r\n  find it troublesome that the circuit court did not look at the documents\r\n  ultimately sought by Evening Post before granting School District's summary\r\n  judgment motion. \r\nAdditionally, School District's\r\n  attorney admitted at the motions hearing that the evaluations were within the\r\n  normal course of events, and that attorney involvement was not necessary to the\r\n  process.Â  During oral argument before this Court, School District's attorney\r\n  clarified his statement by noting that while attorney involvement normally is\r\n  not required, it was necessary in this particular instance.Â  Thus, two reasonable\r\n  inferences regarding the necessity of attorney involvement can be drawn: (1) The\r\n  Board's annual review of the superintendent, required by Floyd's contract was\r\n  within the normal course of events, or (2) attorney involvement was required\r\n  because of the contentious environment surrounding the Board.Â  &quot;Summary judgment\r\n  should not be granted . . . if there is dispute as to the conclusion to be\r\n  drawn from those facts.&quot; Â Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C.\r\n  318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997) (citing Gilliland v. Elmwood Props.,\r\n  301 S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990)).\r\nFinally, we note the policy considerations involved in this case support\r\n  our decision that summary judgment was improper at this early stage in the\r\n  proceedings.Â  The General Assembly, by the clear language of the statute,\r\n  believes FOIA should be broadly construed to allow the public to gain access to\r\n  public records.Â  The interest in confidentiality expressed through the\r\n  attorney-client privilege should not trump the public's right to know at this\r\n  juncture.Â  More development of the facts surrounding the hiring of Childs and Halligan\r\n  as well as court review of the actual completed questionnaire is necessary to\r\n  explore these competing interests before rendering judgment as a matter of law. \r\nII. Motion to Compel\r\nEvening Post contends the\r\n  blank questionnaire's production is important to the development of its theory\r\n  regarding applicability of the attorney-client privilege.Â  School District argues that the discovery sought by\r\n  Evening Post is the relief and subject matter of the lawsuit itself, and its\r\n  production is controlled by City of Columbia.Â  We disagree with School\r\n  District. \r\nIn City of Columbia,\r\n  the ACLU brought an action under FOIA, seeking access to an internal police\r\n  report. 323 S.C. at 384, 475 S.E.2d at 747.Â  The City of Columbia denied the\r\n  initial FOIA request, arguing that the report was subject to an exemption. Â Id. at 386, 475 S.E.2d at 748.Â  The ACLU brought a motion to compel seeking the\r\n  report itself, which the circuit court denied.Â  Id.Â  This Court upheld\r\n  the circuit court's order denying the motion because the document requested in the\r\n  ACLU's motion to compel was the subject matter of the case itself. Â Id. at\r\n  388, 475 S.E.2d at 759.\r\nThe holding in City of\r\n  Columbia is inapposite to this case.Â  Here, Evening Post's motion to compel\r\n  seeks only the blank questionnaire, which is different from what Evening Post\r\n  seeks in the lawsuit itselfâ€”the Board Membersâ€™ completed questionnaires.Â \r\n  Further, there is no evidence to show the attorney-client privilege applies to\r\n  the blank questionnaire.Â  Moreover, there appears to be no reason why the\r\n  circuit court could not have separated the blank questionnaire from the\r\n  attorney memorandum to which it was attached.Â  See Beattie, 319\r\n  S.C. at 453, 462 S.E.2d at 279 (finding that exempt and nonexempt material\r\n  shall be separated and nonexempt material disclosed).Â  School District, in the motions hearing, conceded that\r\n  the evaluation questions were not secret, but were routine evaluation\r\n  questions.Â  &quot;The rulings of a trial\r\n  judge in matters involving discovery will not be disturbed on appeal absent a\r\n  clear showing of an abuse of discretion. . . . An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when there is no evidence to support the trial judge's factual conclusion or\r\n  when the ruling is based upon an error of law.&quot; Bayle v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal citations\r\n  omitted). Therefore, we find the circuit\r\n  court erred in denying Evening Post's motion to compel.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the circuit court\r\n  erred in granting School District's motion for summary judgment and in denying\r\n  Evening Post's motion to compel.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand for\r\n  further proceedings consistent with this decision.Â Â Â  \r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result\r\n  only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In its order, the circuit court stated that Evening\r\n  Post requested five different documents: (1) A memorandum from Childs and\r\n  Halligan to Board members regarding telephone interviews and written\r\n  questionnaires; (2) Board member interview questions attached to the above\r\n  memorandum; (3) confidential questionnaires completed by Board members; (4)\r\n  Mahoney's notes from telephone interviews conducted with Board members; and (5)\r\n  a memorandum from Childs and Halligan containing a summary of the completed\r\n  questionnaires.Â  However, our reading of the record indicates Evening Post's\r\n  complaint and attachments only sought access to the individual Board members'\r\n  completed questionnaires and a summary of the completed evaluations.Â Â  Although\r\n  the circuit court examined the letter from Hawkins to Wright, we note the\r\n  record contains no indication that Evening Post ever requested this specific\r\n  document. Regardless, this apparent ambiguity in the circuit court order does\r\n  not change our analysis.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26950","title":"State v.

Hatcher,\r\n  384 S.C. 372, 681 S.E.2d 925 (Ct. App. 2009), in which the Court of Appeals\r\n  reversed the conviction and sentence of Ricky L. Hatcher on drug charges on the\r\n  ground the State failed to establish a sufficient chain of custody for the drug\r\n  evidence.&nbsp; We reverse.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nHatcher was\r\n  indicted for distribution of crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine\r\n  within one-half mile of a public park for selling crack to an undercover\r\n  informant (&quot;Buyer&quot;) working with the Marlboro County Sheriff's Office\r\n  on October 6, 2006.Â  \r\nAt trial, the\r\n  Buyer testified that he met with two officers on October 6, 2006 in downtown McColl.Â \r\n  They searched the Buyer before providing him with $40.00 to make a drug\r\n  purchase and fitting him with a concealed wire.Â  The Buyer went to Hatcher's\r\n  residence and purchased two pieces of crack cocaine from Hatcher.Â  The two\r\n  pieces were individually wrapped inside small pieces of plastic cut from the\r\n  corners of a sandwich bag.Â  The ends of the plastic were tied into knots.Â  The Buyer\r\n  estimated he was in Hatcher's residence for about three to five minutes before\r\n  he left and delivered the crack to the officers, who were waiting nearby.Â  The\r\n  Buyer identified State's Exhibit 1, which included the crack and two baggies,\r\n  as being the items that he received from Hatcher.Â  \r\nSergeant Jeffrey\r\n  Locklear of the Marlboro County Sheriff's Office testified that he and another\r\n  officer, investigator Brittany English, met the Buyer at 12:25 p.m. on October\r\n  6, 2006.Â  Locklear confirmed all of the details testified to by the Buyer.\r\nRegarding the\r\n  receipt of the drug evidence, Sergeant Locklear testified that the Buyer gave him\r\n  the crack, which was contained in &quot;two tiny plastic corners&quot; cut from\r\n  sandwich bags and tied into knots.Â  Locklear placed the crack (still tied in\r\n  their original packages) inside a plastic evidence bag and &quot;sealed [it]\r\n  with a glue-type seal.&quot;Â  He stated the only way the bag could be opened is\r\n  by cutting it open.Â  Locklear put identifying information on the bag, including\r\n  the case number, the date of 10/06/06, the time of 12:39 p.m. when he retrieved\r\n  the drugs from the Buyer, the approximate weight of the drugs, and that the\r\n  purchase was made at Second Street in McColl from Ricky Hatcher.Â  Locklear\r\n  sealed this package inside a second bag produced by the South Carolina Law\r\n  Enforcement Division (SLED) specifically for the transportation of items to the\r\n  SLED laboratory for testing.Â  Locklear stated he personally transported the\r\n  sealed evidence to SLED.Â  \r\nLocklear\r\n  testified that after the drugs were tested, the SLED agent processing the case\r\n  repackaged the drugs in a heat-sealed bag (that must be cut open) and marked\r\n  the bag with blue writing.Â  SLED returned the heat-sealed bag to the sheriff's\r\n  office.Â  Locklear identified the heat-sealed bag presented at trial as the same\r\n  one that he had personally transported to the court that day.Â  \r\nA forensic\r\n  scientist with SLED, Marjorie Wilson, testified as an expert in the analysis of\r\n  controlled substances and stated that she was the person responsible for\r\n  processing and testing the drug evidence in this case at SLED.Â  Wilson stated she\r\n  retrieved the evidence from the Log-In Department at SLED and that it was still\r\n  sealed in a Best Evidence Kit (or bag).[1]Â \r\n  Wilson testified she broke the seal on the evidence bag and inside she found a second\r\n  bag from the Marlboro County Sheriff's Department that contained &quot;two\r\n  clear plastic corner bags.&quot;Â  Both of the plastic corner bags were still\r\n  knotted, with a rock-like substance inside them.\r\nWilson removed\r\n  the substances from the corner bags and analyzed them before re-packaging the\r\n  contents into two Ziploc bags.Â  She placed the repackaged evidence into a\r\n  heat-sealed pouch and wrote her initials on it and the date it was sealed of\r\n  &quot;5/04/07.&quot;Â  She returned the pouch to SLED's Log-In Department, which\r\n  then gave the evidence back to the Marlboro County Sheriff's Department.Â \r\n  Wilson identified the SLED heat-sealed bag, which was still sealed and bore her\r\n  initials, as the one she had returned to the SLED Log-In Department.Â  She\r\n  confirmed that it was in the same condition as when she had sealed it.Â Â  \r\nThe State moved\r\n  for the admission of State's Exhibit 1, and defense counsel objected on the\r\n  basis the chain of custody had not been sufficiently established.Â  The trial\r\n  judge overruled the objection and admitted the drug evidence.Â  Wilson then further\r\n  testified that she had performed preliminary and confirmatory testing on the\r\n  rock-like substances in State's Exhibit 1 and concluded that crack cocaine was\r\n  in each of the two packages.Â  Wilson confirmed that she performed her testing\r\n  on May 4, 2007, and that she sealed the evidence with the notation, &quot;MW, L0706559, Seal Intact,&quot; and the\r\n  date, &quot;05/04/07.&quot; Â She\r\n  also placed identifying marking on the individual corner bags and on the Ziploc\r\n  bags with the repackaged evidence.Â  \r\nA jury found\r\n  Hatcher guilty as charged, and the trial judge sentenced him to concurrent\r\n  terms of fifteen years in prison.Â  Hatcher appealed his conviction and\r\n  sentence, and the Court of Appeals reversed on the basis the State failed to\r\n  establish a sufficient chain of custody for the drug evidence.Â  State v.\r\n    Hatcher, 384 S.C. 372, 681 S.E.2d 925 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  This Court granted\r\n  the State's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nII.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan,&nbsp;369\r\n  S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265&nbsp;(2006).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support\r\n  or are controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n&quot;[T]his\r\n  Court has long held that a party offering into evidence fungible items such as\r\n  drugs or blood samples must establish a complete chain of custody as far as practicable.&quot;Â  State v. Sweet,\r\n  374 S.C. 1, 6, 647 S.E.2d 202, 205 (2007); see also Benton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. 26, 33, 100 S.E.2d\r\n  534, 537 (1957) (stating &quot;it is generally held that the party offering\r\n  such specimen is required to establish, at least as far as practicable, a\r\n  complete chain of evidence&quot;).Â  \r\n&quot;Where the substance\r\n  analyzed has passed through several hands the evidence must not leave it to conjecture as to who had it\r\n  and what was done with it between the taking and the analysis.&quot;Â  Benton,\r\n  232 S.C. at 33-34, 100 S.E.2d at 537 (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Testimony from each custodian of fungible evidence,\r\n  however, is not a prerequisite to establishing a chain of custody sufficient for admissibility.&quot;Â  Sweet,\r\n  374 S.C. at 7, 647 S.E.2d at 206 (citing State v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18, 27,\r\n  598 S.E.2d 735, 739 (Ct. App. 2004)). &quot;Where other evidence establishes\r\n  the identity of those who have handled the evidence and reasonably demonstrates\r\n  the manner of handling of the evidence, our courts have been willing to fill\r\n  gaps in the chain of custody due to\r\n  an absent witness.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;Proof of\r\n  chain of custody need not negate all possibility of tampering so long as the\r\n  chain of possession is complete.&quot;Â  State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419,\r\n  424, 544 S.E.2d 835, 837&nbsp;(2001).Â  &quot;In applying this rule, we have\r\n  found evidence inadmissible only where there is a missing link in the chain of\r\n  possession because the identity of those who handled the [substance] was not\r\n    established at least as far as practicable.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis\r\n  added). \r\nIn finding the\r\n  chain of custody insufficient in Hatcher's case, the Court of Appeals stated\r\n  that &quot;Officer Locklear and [SLED] Agent Wilson both acted as custodians of\r\n  the evidence,&quot; but &quot;neither is directly linked to the other by\r\n  testimony or documentary evidence.&quot;Â  Hatcher, 384 S.C. at 376, 681\r\n  S.E.2d at 927-28.Â  Specifically, the court stated that the person who received\r\n  the evidence at SLED is not personally identified and there were no details\r\n  presented about how the evidence was handled while in Officer Locklear's\r\n  possession or once it was surrendered at SLED.Â  Id. at 376-77, 681\r\n  S.E.2d at 928.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals acknowledged that South Carolina case law provides that the chain of\r\n  custody need be established only &quot;as far as is reasonably\r\n  practicable&quot; and that each person who handled the evidence is not required\r\n  to testify, but nevertheless stated that &quot;South Carolina courts have\r\n  consistently held that all persons in the chain of custody must be\r\n  identified and the manner of handling the evidence must be demonstrated.&quot;Â  Id. at 377, 681 S.E.2d at 928 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals relied in large part upon its opinion in State v. Chisolm, 355\r\n  S.C. 175, 584 S.E.2d 401 (Ct. App. 2003), in which it effectively held South\r\n  Carolina law requires every individual who handled the evidence to be specifically\r\n  identified, either by providing testimony under oath or producing sworn\r\n  statements pursuant to Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP.Â  The Court of Appeals, sitting en\r\n  banc, subsequently overruled Chisolm in State v. Taylor, 360 S.C.\r\n  18, 27, 598 S.E.2d 735, 739 (Ct. App. 2004), stating that, &quot;[t]o the\r\n  extent [Chisolm] can be read to require the testimony of each person in\r\n  the chain of custody under all circumstances, it is inconsistent with the\r\n  precedent established by our supreme court, and is hereby overruled.&quot;Â  \r\nAlthough Hatcher\r\n  asserts our cases hold all individuals must be identified without exception,\r\n  this appears to be an extrapolation of the general observation that where all\r\n  individuals in the chain are, in fact, identified and the manner of handling is\r\n  reasonably demonstrated, it is not an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to\r\n  admit the evidence in the absence of proof of tampering, bad faith, or\r\n  ill-motive. Â See, e.g., Sweet, 374 S.C. at 6, 647 S.E.2d at\r\n  205-06; Taylor, 360 S.C. at 25, 598 S.E.2d at 738. \r\nIn a case\r\n  involving the chain of custody of a blood sample in a paternity case, we\r\n  reiterated the standard set forth in Benton v. Pellum that the chain of\r\n  custody must be established as far as practicable, and we specifically stated\r\n  that &quot;we have never held the chain of custody rule requires every person\r\n  associated with the procedure be available to testify or identified personally,\r\n  depending on the facts of the case.&quot;Â  South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 629, 614 S.E.2d 642, 646&nbsp;(2005).\r\nÂ In Cochran,\r\n  this Court found the chain of custody was sufficient even though the courier\r\n  who transported the samples from the collection site to the testing facility was\r\n  never identified, where &quot;the samples arrived at the testing facility sealed\r\n  and intact&quot;:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    testimony presented by DSS indicates the blood samples were secure when Kejales\r\n    took the samples at the collection site. The testimony also indicates the\r\n    samples arrived at the testing facility sealed and intact. Additionally, each person\r\n    involved in the actual testing procedure once the samples arrived at the\r\n    facility, testified as to their handling of each respective sample and the\r\n    chain of custody. Generally, we will uphold the chain of custody if the\r\n      safeguards instituted ensure the integrity of the evidence, even if every\r\n      person associated with the procedure is not personally identified.Â  Other courts are in accord.\r\n\r\nId. at 629, 614 S.E.2d at 646 (emphasis added) (footnote\r\n  omitted); see also State v. Kahan, 268 S.C. 240, 244-45, 233\r\n  S.E.2d 293, 294&nbsp;(1977) (holding the standard stated in Benton v. Pellum had been met where the evidence was transported in accordance with normal\r\n  protocol, even though every person who may have handled it was not personally\r\n  identified and there was no testimony regarding the care and handling of the\r\n  item for an interval when it was being stored).\r\nIn Cochran, this Court\r\n  noted that &quot;[w]hether the chain of custody has been established as far as\r\n  practicable clearly depends on the unique factual circumstances of each\r\n  case.&quot;Â  Cochran, 364 S.C. at 629 n.1, 614 S.E.2d at 646 n.1.Â  In\r\n  examining issues regarding the chain of custody, a mere suggestion that\r\n  substitution could possibly have occurred is not enough to establish a break in\r\n  the chain of custody.Â  Turner v. State, 3 So. 3d 742 (Miss. 2009); see\r\n    also State v. Tester, 968 A.2d 895 (Vt. 2009) (finding the State\r\n  provided a sufficient chain of custody for DNA swab samples, even though the nurse\r\n  failed to keep records of each step in collecting and storing the evidence, where\r\n  the nurse testified that she took the samples according to rape kit\r\n  instructions and established protocols and sealed and labeled them).\r\n&quot;It is\r\n  unnecessary . . . that the police account for 'every hand-to-hand transfer' of\r\n  the item; it is sufficient if the evidence demonstrates a reasonable assurance\r\n  the condition of the item remains the same from the time it was obtained until\r\n  its introduction at trial.&quot;Â  State v. Price, 731 S.W.2d 287, 290\r\n  (Mo. Ct. App. 1987) (citation omitted); accord Commonwealth v.\r\n    Kaufman, 452 A.2d 1039, 1042&nbsp;(Pa. Super. Ct. 1982).Â  &quot;To expect the [prosecuting authority] to produce\r\n  every possible individual who may have had fleeting contact with the evidence\r\n  would cause unnecessary logistical problems concerning chain of custody.&quot;Â  Commonwealth v. Herman, 431 A.2d 1016, 1019 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1981) (holding\r\n  the absence of testimony from a crime lab custodian who merely logged in the\r\n  seized marijuana was not fatal to the chain of custody where the officers who\r\n  seized the drugs and the chemist who tested them did testify at trial).\r\nCourts have\r\n  abandoned inflexible rules regarding the chain of custody and the admissibility\r\n  of evidence in favor of a rule granting discretion to the trial courts.Â  United\r\n    States v. De Larosa, 450 F.2d 1057, 1068 (3d Cir. 1971).Â  &quot;The trial\r\n  judge's exercise of discretion must be reviewed in the light of the following\r\n  factors:Â  '. . . the nature of the article, the circumstances surrounding the\r\n  preservation and custody of it, and the likelihood of intermeddlers tampering\r\n  with it.' &quot; Id. (citation omitted).Â  &quot;If upon the consideration of such factors the trial judge is\r\n  satisfied that in reasonable probability the article has not been changed in\r\n  important respects, he may permit its introduction in evidence.&quot;Â  Gallego\r\n    v. United States,&nbsp;276 F.2d 914, 917&nbsp;(9th Cir. 1960).\r\nConsidering those\r\n  factors here, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge's admission of\r\n  the drug evidence in Hatcher's case.Â  We agree with the Court of Appeals that the\r\n  mere fact that evidence is sealed upon presentation for testing does not, in\r\n  itself, establish a sufficient chain of custody.Â  Evidence is still required as\r\n  to how the item was obtained and how it was handled to ensure that it is, in\r\n  fact, what it is purported to be.Â  However, we have consistently held that the\r\n  chain of custody need be established only as far as practicable, and we\r\n  reiterate that every person handling the evidence need not be identified in all\r\n  cases. \r\nIn this case, the\r\n  Buyer who purchased the drugs from Hatcher, the police officer who received the\r\n  drugs from the Buyer and transported them to SLED in two sealed, tamper-evident\r\n  bags (one inside the other), and the SLED agent who retrieved the drugs from\r\n  the Log-In Department at SLED (still double-sealed) and tested them, all\r\n  testified about the chain of custody and their handling of the drugs and the\r\n  fact that there was no evidence of tampering.Â  The ultimate goal of chain of\r\n  custody requirements is simply to ensure that the item is what it is purported\r\n  to be.Â  The record here indicates the drugs received for testing were in fact,\r\n  those taken from Hatcher without any alteration, tampering, or substitution.Â  \r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nThe State need\r\n  not establish the identity of every person handling fungible items in all\r\n  circumstances; rather, the standard is whether, in the discretion of the trial\r\n  judge, the State has established the chain of custody as far as practicable.Â  This\r\n  determination will necessarily depend on the unique factual circumstances of\r\n  each case.Â  We conclude the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding\r\n  a sufficient chain of custody existed to allow admission of the drug evidence.Â \r\n  Consequently, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. \r\nREVERSED.[2]\r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  and Acting Justices James E.

Â Â While under suspension, on August 25, 2008,\r\n  Respondent accepted $2,000 from Client's mother to do additional work on\r\n  Client's case, and signed a receipt acknowledging this fee on that same day.Â  \r\nAccording to the mother's\r\n  testimony, she filed a complaint against Respondent because once Respondent\r\n  began experiencing personal problems, he ceased communicating with her and\r\n  Client, would not return phone calls, and to her knowledge, did not work on the\r\n  case.Â  She stated there was a lack of communication while Respondent was\r\n  suspended, but then Respondent informed her $2,000 was needed to pay an\r\n  informant.Â  Client's mother testified Respondent informed her he was suspended,\r\n  but she nevertheless paid him the money, and he issued her a receipt.Â  Client's\r\n  mother was able to recover the $12,000 she paid Respondent through the South\r\n  Carolina Bar Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (Lawyers' Fund).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nUltimately, the Panel found\r\n  Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\nSCACR:\r\n\r\n    Rule 1.4 (Communication)\r\n  Rule 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice of\r\n    Law)\r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (Violation of RPC)\r\n  Rule 8.4(e) (Conduct Prejudicial\r\n    to the Administration of Justice)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Panel found\r\n  Respondent violated Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and Rule 7(a)(5),\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nThe Panel considered as an aggravating circumstance\r\n  Respondent's disciplinary history.Â  On two occasions, in February 2004 and\r\n  April 2008, Respondent was briefly suspended by the South Carolina Commission\r\n  on Continuing Legal Education and Specialization for failure to acquire the\r\n  requisite Continuing Legal Education (CLE) hours.Â  On June 24, 2008, Respondent\r\n  was placed on interim suspension.Â  Braghirol, 378 S.C. at 592, 663\r\n  S.E.2d at 480.Â  On January 16, 2009, Respondent received a confidential\r\n  Admonition citing Rules of Professional Conduct 1.4 (Communication), 8.1 (Bar\r\n  Admission Matter), and 8.4 (Misconduct) of Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, on April 2, 2009, Respondent was again suspended by the CLE\r\n  Commission, which resulted in a suspension by this Court on June 11, 2009 for\r\n  failure to comply with CLE requirements.Â  Then on July 13, 2009, this Court\r\n  suspended Respondent for a period of nine months, with conditions.Â  Braghirol,\r\n  383 S.C. at 379, 680 S.E.2d at 284.Â  That proceeding involved five separate\r\n  instances of misconduct, for the most part involving failures to communicate\r\n  with clients or to work diligently on those clients' cases.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Respondent did not comply with the conditions of the Court's order in that\r\n  matter, and this Court directed Respondent to personally appear before the\r\n  Court on September 1, 2010, to show cause why he should not be held in criminal\r\n  or civil contempt of court.Â  Respondent appeared at that hearing and admitted\r\n  his failure to comply with the order.Â  This Court issued an order finding Respondent\r\n  in civil contempt, but stating he could purge himself of incarceration by\r\n  taking certain specified actions.Â  Respondent complied with this order.\r\nAfter considering the facts of the case and\r\n  Respondent's disciplinary history, the Panel recommended his suspension from\r\n  the practice of law for a period of fifteen months, retroactive to the end of\r\n  the nine month suspension that was imposed by this Court on July 13, 2009.Â \r\n  Additionally, the Panel recommended Respondent pay a fine, to be determined by this\r\n  Court, within thirty days of the Court's order, Respondent pay the costs of\r\n  these proceedings, and Respondent be required to complete the South Carolina\r\n  Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School as a condition for\r\n  reinstatement. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe sole authority to\r\n  discipline attorneys and decide appropriate sanctions after a thorough review\r\n  of the record rests with this Court.Â  In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10-11,\r\n  539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  In such matters, this Court may draw its own\r\n  conclusions and make its own findings of fact. Â Id.Â  Nonetheless, the\r\n  findings and conclusions of the Panel are entitled much respect and\r\n  consideration.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe parties, by not filing\r\n  briefs, have accepted the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\n  recommendations of the Hearing Panel.Â  Respondent admits that he knowingly\r\n  accepted a $2,000 fee for legal services while his license to practice law was\r\n  under suspension.Â  Rule 5.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, found under\r\n  Rule 407 of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules, prohibits a lawyer who is\r\n  not admitted to practice in a jurisdiction from representing that he is\r\n  admitted to practice law.Â  Although Client's mother testified Respondent\r\n  informed her that his license to practice law was suspended, he nevertheless\r\n  requested and then accepted $2,000 on behalf of Client for legal services.Â Â  His\r\n  flagrant disregard of this Court's suspension is reprehensible.Â  However, in\r\n  mitigation, this Court considers that the majority of Respondent's disciplinary\r\n  history stems from events occurring in 2008, a time when Respondent candidly\r\n  admits he experienced a series of personal crises and ultimately had a mental\r\n  breakdown.Â  The recommendation of a fifteen month suspension, retroactive to\r\n  the expiration of the previously imposed nine month suspension, cumulatively\r\n  results in a two year suspension from the practice of law.Â  In hopes this\r\n  extended period will allow Respondent to order his life and law practice to\r\n  better align with the high standards expected of a practicing attorney, we\r\n  follow the Panel's recommendation.Â  The Panel additionally recommended this\r\n  Court impose a fine to be paid within thirty days of this opinion.Â  Because\r\n  Respondent accepted $2,000 in legal fees, which was refunded to Client's mother\r\n  through the Lawyers' Fund, we require Respondent reimburse the Lawyers' Fund\r\n  that amount within thirty days of the date of this opinion, if he has not\r\n  already done so. Â Lastly, we follow the Panel's recommendation that Respondent\r\n  pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings and complete ethics training before\r\n  petitioning this Court for reinstatement to the practice of law.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  this Court accepts the recommendations of the Panel, and additionally requires\r\n  Respondent reimburse the Lawyers' Fund in the amount of $2,000 within thirty\r\n  days of the date of this opinion.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In re Braghirol, 383 S.C. 379, 680 S.E.2d 284 (2009).\r\n[2] Neither party filed briefs with this Court.Â \r\n  Therefore, the parties are deemed to have accepted the Panel's findings of\r\n  fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations.Â  See Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR (&quot;The failure of a party to file a brief taking exceptions to\r\n  the report constitutes acceptance of the findings of fact, conclusions of law,\r\n  and recommendations.&quot;).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26952","title":"Utilities Services v.

(&quot;Utility&quot;) was established in 2002 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Utilities, Inc.\r\n(&quot;UI&quot;).&nbsp; Utility supplies water to over 6,800 customers in eighty-one South Carolina neighborhoods and wastewater services to over 370 customers\r\nin four neighborhoods.&nbsp; In some of these neighborhoods, Utility supplies water that it purchases in bulk from other water systems.&nbsp; Customers in these\r\nneighborhoods are known as &quot;distribution-only&quot; customers.\r\nIn January 2006, the PSC approved an increase to Utility's rates.&nbsp; This rate schedule distinguished between regular residential customers and\r\ndistribution-only customers.&nbsp; Distribution-only customers were charged a basic facilities charge, a &quot;commodity charge&quot; that varied based on\r\nusage, and a pro rata portion of the cost to Utility for its purchase of bulk water.&nbsp; The regular residential customers were charged a basic facilities\r\ncharge and a higher commodity charge.\r\nIn August 2007, Utility again applied for a rate increase. Utility requested the PSC use the &quot;rate of return on rate base&quot;[2] method to determine the reasonableness of its proposed rates.&nbsp; Utility claimed it had invested three million dollars in\r\n&quot;plant additions&quot;[3] since its previous rate case, resulting in a rate base of approximately 9.7 million\r\ndollars.[4]&nbsp; To achieve its desired rate of return on rate base, Utility requested an increase to the basic\r\nfacilities charge and to the commodity charge for both regular residential and distribution-only customers.\r\nThe PSC held public hearings regarding the 2007 application in York, Anderson, and Richland Counties.&nbsp; At the public hearings, Utility customers from\r\nseven neighborhoods testified to various problems with the quality of their water.&nbsp; The main complaints were that Utility's water tasted and/or smelled\r\nbad, caused damage to fixtures and appliances, and did not adequately clean clothes.&nbsp; One customer testified she had received notice from Utility that the\r\nwater system in her neighborhood contained elevated levels of lead.&nbsp; Several customers testified that, because of the poor quality of Utility's water, they\r\ninvested in water softeners and water filters or drank bottled water.\r\nIn light of these concerns, one customer questioned the fairness of Utility's request for an increase to its basic facilities charge.&nbsp; She noted that,\r\nbecause the basic facilities charge was a flat rate charge, Utility's revenues would increase even if its customers avoided using its water.\r\nIn addition, customers from eleven neighborhoods testified they had not seen any capital improvements and/or improvements in water quality since the last\r\nrate increase.&nbsp; In fact, one customer testified the quality of Utility's water service had declined.\r\nBruce T. Haas, regional director of operations for UI, testified that Utility has a &quot;capital improvements program&quot; and &quot;ongoing operational\r\nprograms such as routine testing and periodic water main flushing to improve water quality.&quot;&nbsp; Haas listed the types of capital improvements Utility\r\nhad made since it acquired its water systems in 2002, but he did not specify which of these improvements had occurred since the last rate increase.\r\nThe PSC asked Haas whether Utility planned any capital improvements in the neighborhoods the customers complained about.&nbsp; Haas was able to name some\r\nprograms in one neighborhood, but he did not provide specific information about any other neighborhood.&nbsp; Rather, he reiterated the general types of\r\nupgrades Utility had implemented &quot;since [it] took over,&quot; and stated Utility upgraded &quot;nearly every single facility that [it] had.&quot;[5]\r\nIn addition to its questions regarding capital improvements, the PSC asked Utility about the reasonableness of payments Utility made to its affiliate,\r\nBio-Tech.&nbsp; Bio-Tech is a wholly owned subsidiary of UI that provides sludge hauling services, wastewater plant maintenance, and construction\r\nservices.&nbsp; A Utility witness testified that Bio-Tech charged the same price to all of its customers, regardless of whether they were affiliates.&nbsp;\r\nThus, she contended, Bio-Tech's prices were market rates.&nbsp; However, she was unable to provide the PSC with information about whether Utility had compared\r\nBio-Tech's prices to the prices of Bio-Tech's competitors.\r\nRepresentatives of ORS then testified, and they verified that Utility had made at least some capital improvements following its last rate case.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, ORS also suggested several adjustments to Utility's figures.&nbsp; Thus, ORS recommended the PSC find Utility had a rate base of 9.14 million dollars.[6]\r\nThe PSC denied Utility's application for a rate increase.&nbsp; It found the customer complaints &quot;raise[d] questions as to where the capital\r\nimprovements and on-going operations programs testified to by the Company witness were implemented, and whether they were effective.&quot;&nbsp; It concluded\r\nthat &quot;[w]ithout more specificity on the part of the Company,&quot; it could not &quot;credit the Company with the capital improvements and on-going\r\noperations that it purports to have made.&quot;&nbsp; Moreover, it found that because Utility &quot;failed to identify for the most part where the [claimed]\r\nexpenditures were made, or how such expenditures contributed to improved service[,]&quot; it could not determine whether those expenditures &quot;were\r\nappropriate and whether [they] justified the imposition of a rate increase.&quot;&nbsp; In addition, the PSC found Utility &quot;failed to provide required\r\ninformation regarding affiliate transactions with . . . Bio-Tech.&quot;&nbsp; Utility appeals.\r\nII.\r\nThe PSC's ratemaking decisions are entitled to deference, and will be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; S.C. Energy Users Comm. v. S.C.\r\nPublic Service Comm'n, 388 S.C. 486, 490, 697 S.E.2d 587, 589 (2010). &nbsp;&quot;Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that, considering the\r\nrecord as a whole, a reasonable mind would accept to support an administrative agency's action.&quot;&nbsp; Porter v. S.C. Public Service Comm'n, 333\r\nS.C. 12, 20, 507 S.E.2d 328, 332 (1998).&nbsp; &quot;We will not substitute our judgment for that of the PSC where there is room for a difference of intelligent\r\nopinion.&quot;&nbsp; Kiawah Property Owners Group v. Public Service Comm'n of S.C., 357 S.C. 232, 237, 593 S.E.2d 148, 151 (2004). &nbsp;However,\r\nwe &quot;may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the [PSC's] findings, inferences, conclusions,\r\nor decisions are: . . . (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; [or] (d) affected by other error of\r\nlaw.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (2005 &amp; Supp. 2010).\r\nIII.\r\nA fundamental question presented by both Utility and ORS is this: can the PSC determine that a regulated utility has failed to meet its burden to prove\r\nexpenditures when ORS has not challenged the expenditures?&nbsp; The answer to this question requires us to examine the nature of the PSC.\r\nPrior to 2004, the PSC was empowered to&nbsp; &quot;supervise and regulate the rates and service of every public utility . . . and to fix just and reasonable\r\nstandards, classifications, regulations, practices and measurements of service to be furnished, imposed or observed and followed by every public utility in this\r\nState.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-140 (1976).&nbsp; In addition, the PSC was empowered to &quot;upon its own motion, institute an inquiry into any\r\nsubject matter within its jurisdiction.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-280 (1976).&nbsp; The PSC could request detailed reports from any public utility\r\nregarding its &quot;business affairs or any matter pertaining thereto&quot; and conduct &quot;examination[s] of the books, papers, accounts and records&quot; of\r\nutilities if &quot;necessary to procure the information required.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-190 (1976); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-210 (1976).&nbsp; When a\r\nutility sought to change its rates, the PSC could &quot;make such investigations as in its opinion the public interest require[d].&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n58-5-250 (1976).&nbsp; The PSC could &quot;employ . . . technical, administrative or clerical staff or other aid&quot; to assist in carrying out these\r\nduties.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-60 (1976).&nbsp; In short, the PSC performed both investigative and adjudicative functions.\r\nIn 2004, the General Assembly eliminated the PSC from the roles of investigator and auditor, and it reassigned these roles to a newly-created agency,\r\nORS.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-60(D) (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010) (&quot;The commission shall not inspect, audit, or examine public utilities.&nbsp; The\r\ninspection, auditing, and examination of public utilities is solely the responsibility of the Office of Regulatory Staff.&quot;).&nbsp; ORS now has the power to\r\nreview and investigate rate applications, and to make recommendations to the PSC.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-4-50(A)(1) (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; ORS also\r\nhas the duty to &quot;represent the public interest in commission proceedings . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Id. Â§ 58-4-50(A)(4).\r\nThe PSC's powers with regard to ratemaking were not eliminated, however.&nbsp; The PSC retained its powers &quot;to supervise and regulate&quot; rates and\r\nservice and &quot;to fix just and reasonable standards, classifications, regulations, practices, and measurements of service.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n58-3-140(A) (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010).&nbsp; Pursuant to these powers, the PSC is entitled to create incentives for utilities to improve their business\r\npractices.&nbsp; Accordingly, the PSC may determine that some portion of an expense actually incurred by a utility should not be passed on to consumers.&nbsp; Patton\r\nv. S.C. Public Service Comm'n, 280 S.C. 288, 292, 312 S.E.2d 257, 259-60 (1984); see Southern Bell Telephone, 270 S.C. at 599, 244 S.E.2d at\r\n283 (finding it was not improper for the PSC to consider whether a utility could undertake measures to cut costs and improve efficiency).\r\nWhen presiding over a ratemaking proceeding, the PSC takes on a quasi-judicial role.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-30(B) (1976 &amp; Supp.\r\n2010) (&quot;The commissioners . . . are bound by the Code of Judicial Conduct . . . .&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-260 (Supp. 2010) (limiting ex parte communications\r\nbetween the PSC and any party to a &quot;matter to be adjudicated, decided, or arbitrated&quot; by the PSC).&nbsp; &nbsp;Nevertheless, it may request ORS\r\nconduct an investigation of a rate application:\r\n\r\n  The commission has the authority to initiate inspections, audits, and examinations of all persons and entities subject to its jurisdiction. . . .\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission must not conduct such inspections, audits, and examinations itself, but must request that\r\n  they be conducted by the Office of Regulatory Staff pursuant to Section 58-4-50(A)(2).\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-200 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).&nbsp; South Carolina Code section 58-4-50(A)(2) provides:\r\n\r\n  [W]hen considered necessary by the Executive Director of [ORS] and in the public interest, [ORS has the duty and responsibility to] make inspections,\r\n  audits, and examinations of public utilities regarding matters within the jurisdiction of the commission.&nbsp; The regulatory staff has sole\r\n  responsibility for this duty but shall also make such inspections, audits, or examinations of public utilities as requested by the commission.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).&nbsp; See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-4-50(B) (providing, in relevant part, that &quot;upon request, the Executive Director of [ORS]\r\nmust employ the resources of the regulatory staff to furnish to the commission . . . such information and reports . . . and provide other assistance as\r\nmay reasonably be required in order to supervise and control the public utilities of the State . . . .&quot;).\r\nThus, the PSC's new role in ratemaking proceedings conforms to the general principle that the roles of investigator and adjudicator should be performed by\r\nseparate persons.&nbsp; Cf. S.C. Const. art I, Â§ 22 (&quot;[N]or shall [a person] be subject to the same person for both prosecution and\r\nadjudication . . . .&quot;); Ross v. Medical University of S.C., 328 S.C. 51, 69-70, 492 S.E.2d 62, 72 (1997) (explaining that article 1, section 22 aims\r\nto prevent an adjudicator from becoming impartial by gathering &quot;ex parte information as a result of prior investigation&quot;).\r\nConsidering these authorities together, we hold the PSC is the ultimate fact-finder in a ratemaking application.&nbsp; It has the power to independently\r\ndetermine whether an applicant has met its burden of proof.&nbsp; The PSC is not bound by ORS's determination that an expenditure was reasonable and proper for\r\ninclusion in a rate application.&nbsp; The PSC may determineâ€”independent of any partyâ€”that an expenditure is suspect and requires further scrutiny.&nbsp; To\r\naccept the contention that the PSC is bound by the recommendations of ORS would place ORS in the same untenable dual investigative-adjudicative role that\r\nchallenged the PSC prior to the 2004 amendments.\r\nHaving established that the PSC was entitled to make an independent determination about whether Utility met its burden of proof, we turn now to a discussion\r\nof the contours of that burden.\r\nIV.\r\nUtility has argued the PSC acted arbitrarily and in conflict with its prior practice when it required neighborhood-by-neighborhood data in response to\r\ncustomer complaints.&nbsp; In addition, Utility argues the PSC erred in requiring additional data to support its payments to Bio-Tech.&nbsp; As explained above,\r\nthe PSC was entitled to request more information about Utility's expenditures before ruling on whether those expenditures were properly included in the rate\r\napplication.[7]\r\nNevertheless, we hold the PSC committed three errors of law in determining Utility failed to meet its burden of proof.&nbsp; First, we hold the PSC was\r\nrequired to provide Utility with a meaningful opportunity to supplement its application with the information the PSC requested.&nbsp; Second, we hold the PSC\r\nerred in failing to accord Utility the presumption of reasonableness applicable to its expenses.&nbsp; Finally, we hold the PSC erred in denying the rate\r\napplication as a whole where only some of Utility's expenditures were brought into question.\r\nA. Meaningful Opportunity to Respond\r\nConsistent with its obligation to provide Utility an opportunity to achieve a reasonable return,[8] the PSC was\r\nobligated to accord Utility a meaningful opportunity to rebut the evidence presented in opposition to its proposed rates.&nbsp; Cf. 26 S.C. Code Ann.\r\nRegs. 103-845(C) (Supp. 2010) (&quot;[T]he Commission shall require any party and the Office of Regulatory Staff to file copies of testimony and exhibits and\r\nserve them on all other parties of record within a specified time in advance of the hearing.&quot;).&nbsp; Here, the PSC denied Utility's application for a rate\r\nincrease on the ground that Utility failed to meet its burden of proof.&nbsp; However, Utility supplied the information expressly required by the PSC's\r\nregulations, and the PSC did not give Utility a meaningful opportunity to provide the additional information the PSC determined was necessary.&nbsp; This was an\r\nerror of law.\r\nThe information an applicant must provide in support of its proposed rate increase is set forth by regulation.&nbsp; These regulations do not explicitly\r\nrequire neighborhood-by-neighborhood data, nor do they require any particular type of data regarding the reasonableness of payments to an affiliated\r\nentity.&nbsp; See 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 103-512.4(A) (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010) (requirements for wastewater utilities seeking an increase in\r\nexisting rate); 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 103-712(4)(A) (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010) (requirements for water utilities seeking an increase in existing rates); 26 S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Regs. 103-823 (Supp. 2010) (applications in general).\r\nConsequently, Utility had no notice the PSC would require additional information about specific neighborhoods until the PSC requested that information at a\r\npublic hearing.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, Utility was able to give only generalized answers and answers from memory, rather than the targeted and\r\nspecific data the PSC seems to have desired.&nbsp; Similarly, while Utility could expect the PSC to examine the reasonableness of its transactions with an\r\naffiliate,[9] it had no notice prior to its hearing that the PSC would require information about the prices charged\r\nby Bio-Tech's competitors.\r\nThe PSC was entitled to request this information pursuant to its role as fact-finder and pursuant to regulation.&nbsp; See 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n103-512.4(A)(16) (requiring an applicant for a rate increase to include with its application &quot;[a]ny other pertinent or relevant information determined\r\nnecessary by the commission.&quot;); 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 103-712(4)(A)(16) (same).&nbsp; Nevertheless, where the PSC seeks additional information beyond\r\nthat which its regulations explicitly require, it must give an applicant an appropriate opportunity to gather data in response.\r\nBecause the PSC did not give Utility a fair opportunity to respond in this case, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.&nbsp; Cf. Hilton\r\nHead Plantation Utilities, Inc. v. Public Service Comm'n of S.C., 312 S.C. 448, 449-52, 441 S.E.2d 321, 322-23 (1994) (after finding the PSC did not err in\r\ndenying a rate increase based on the lack of evidence before it, remanding to provide the utility &quot;an ample opportunity to explain its expenditures and\r\njustify them&quot;).\r\nB. Presumption of Reasonableness\r\nUtility contends that it could satisfy its burden of proof simply by comparing its current test year[10]\r\nexpenses with the expenses from the test year for its previous rate case.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nUtility is correct that it was entitled to a presumption that its expenditures were reasonable and incurred in good faith, and therefore, a showing that its\r\nexpenses had increased since its last rate case could satisfy its burden of proof.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the presumption in a utility's favor clearly does\r\nnot foreclose scrutiny and a challenge.&nbsp; In those circumstances, the burden remains on the utility to demonstrate the reasonableness of its costs.&nbsp; It\r\nseems to us that Utility wants the presumption of reasonableness to be dispositive. In Hamm, 309 S.C. at 286-87, 422 S.E.2d at 112-13, we stated:\r\n\r\n  Although the burden of proof of the reasonableness of all costs incurred which enter into a rate increase request rests with the utility, the utility's\r\n  expenses are presumed to be reasonable and incurred in good faith.&nbsp; This presumption does not shift the burden of persuasion but shifts the burden of\r\n  production on to the Commission or other contesting party to demonstrate a tenable basis for raising the specter of imprudence.&nbsp; This evidence may\r\n  be provided . . . through the Commission's broad investigatory powers.&nbsp; The ultimate burden of showing every reasonable effort to minimize . . . costs\r\n  remains on the utility.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added) (citations omitted).&nbsp; Hamm was decided prior to the creation of ORS and the accompanying change in the role of the PSC.&nbsp; It\r\nholds true, however, that an investigation by ORS might &quot;rais[e] the specter of imprudence.&quot;&nbsp; And, as we have discussed, the PSC may initiate an\r\nORS investigation.&nbsp; Thus, if an investigation initiated by ORS or by the PSC yields evidence that overcomes the presumption of\r\nreasonableness, a utility must further substantiate its claimed expenditures.\r\nUtility next argues, based on Hamm, that testimony by non-party customers cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness.[11]&nbsp; Non-party members of the public (also known as &quot;protestants&quot;) are entitled to voice an objection to proposed\r\nrates by providing sworn testimony at a public hearing, and this sworn testimony becomes part of the formal record before the PSC.&nbsp; 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n103-804(E), (R) (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010); 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 103-827 (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; Protestants are permitted to object &quot;on the ground of private\r\nor public interest.&quot;&nbsp; 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 103-804(R).\r\nIn Hilton Head, 312 S.C. at 449-51, 441 S.E.2d at 322-23, we upheld the PSC's decision to deny a rate increase on the ground that a non-party\r\nprotestant had questioned whether the utility's transactions with its corporate parent were conducted at arm's length, and the utility had failed to provide an\r\nadequate response.&nbsp; Though Hilton Head concerned affiliate expenses, and therefore, no presumption of reasonableness applied,[12] our opinion did not so limit the PSC's ability to consider non-party testimony.&nbsp; Rather, we held the PSC\r\n&quot;had the duty to believe or disbelieve [the] evidence submitted.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 451, 441 S.E.2d at 323.\r\nBecause the PSC is both entitled and required to consider the evidence presented to it on the formal record, we hold the PSC is entitled to rely on sworn\r\ntestimony presented by non-party protestants to overcome the presumption of reasonableness.&nbsp; Accordingly, we hold the PSC could consider customer testimony\r\nthat Utility's water quality had not improved and that capital improvements had not been made when determining whether to credit Utility with the expenditures\r\nfor capital improvement that it claimed.[13]\r\nNevertheless, the customer testimony in this case could only have &quot;rais[ed] the specter of imprudence&quot; as to expenditures that Utility claimed to\r\nhave incurred in neighborhoods where customers alleged no improvements were made.&nbsp; These customers could offer no insight into whether Utility made capital\r\nimprovements in other neighborhoods.&nbsp; Thus, as discussed below, we hold the PSC erred in failing to accord Utility the presumption of reasonableness as to\r\nexpenditures that were not called into question by customer testimony or by any other source.\r\nC. Unchallenged Expenditures\r\nWhile we recognize the PSC was entitled to determine Utility should not be credited with some of the expenditures it claimed, Utility argues, and we\r\nagree, that the concerns raised at the public hearings were not sufficient to overcome the presumption of reasonableness as to all of Utility's claimed\r\nexpenditures.&nbsp; Thus, rather than denying Utility's rate application in its entirety, the PSC should have adjusted Utility's application to reflect only\r\nthose expenditures the PSC determined should be passed on to consumers.&nbsp; See Patton, 280 S.C. at 292, 312 S.E.2d at 259-60 (finding the PSC\r\ncould refuse to pass a portion of an expense on to ratepayers, in the interest of promoting good business practices).\r\nORS investigated Utility's expenditures and made adjustments where it found they were necessary, thereby reducing Utility's claimed rate base by more than\r\n$550,000.&nbsp; Customer testimony regarding water quality and the lack of capital improvements brought the prudence of certain other expenditures into\r\nquestion. &nbsp;However, the customers who testified represented only a small portion of the eighty-one neighborhoods in which Utility provides water\r\nservice.&nbsp; Utility, on the other hand, testified it made improvements to almost every water system it owned.&nbsp; The PSC was required to consider whether,\r\neven putting aside the expenditures it found questionable, Utility was entitled to some increase in its rates.\r\nLikewise, because Utility's payments to its affiliate accounted for only a small portion of Utility's budget, a decision to exclude those expenses from\r\nUtility's rate application could not justify an outright denial of the rate increase.\r\nIn sum, we find the PSC could rely on non-party testimony, or on any other relevant evidence, to determine that the presumption of reasonableness had been\r\novercome as to a particular expense.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the PSC should have credited Utility with the expenses that were not challenged.&nbsp; Accordingly, on\r\nremand, and after giving Utility the opportunity to meaningfully respond to the evidence challenging the rate increase recommended by ORS, the PSC must\r\ndetermine whether, even excluding any expenses it finds imprudent, Utility's expenses have increased since its last rate application such that it might be\r\nentitled to an increase in its rates.\r\nV.\r\nUtility has raised two other ways in which it contends the PSC erred as a matter of law.&nbsp; First, Utility argues the PSC may not consider notions of\r\nfairness when evaluating a rate application.&nbsp; Second, Utility argues the PSC may not consider the fact that Utility received a rate increase in the recent\r\npast.&nbsp; We address these arguments in turn.\r\nA. Fairness of a Rate Increase\r\nDistribution-only customers from nine subdivisions testified the price of Utility's service was unreasonable by comparison to the prices charged by the water\r\nsystems from which Utility purchased its water.&nbsp; In addition, distribution-only customers testified that, because they are charged a pro rata portion of\r\nthe total water purchased by Utility from its suppliers, they are made to pay for water that leaks when Utility equipment fails.&nbsp; This concern was\r\ncorroborated by ORS.&nbsp; Accordingly, ORS recommended a change to Utility's rate structure: it recommended the PSC place a &quot;cap&quot; on the amount of\r\nunaccounted for water that may be charged to Utility's distribution-only customers.\r\nThe PSC found customer testimony about the rates charged by Utility versus by its suppliers raised &quot;questions of fairness with regard to [Utility's]\r\nprice.&quot;&nbsp; The PSC stated that &quot;[i]f the difference in rates is justifiable, the customers deserve to know why.&quot;&nbsp; Moreover, the PSC\r\nstated it could not find evidence in the record supporting an increase in the distribution-only customers' rates.\r\nUtility now argues the concept of fairness, unaccompanied by objective criteria, is an arbitrary standard improper for consideration by the PSC in ratemaking\r\nproceedings.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nWe have held the PSC's duty to fix &quot;just and reasonable&quot; rates includes a duty to &quot;distribute fairly the revenue requirements [of the\r\nutility], considering the price at which the company's service is rendered and the quality of that service.&quot;&nbsp; Seabrook Island Property Owners Ass'n\r\nv. S.C. Public Service Comm'n, 303 S.C. 493, 499, 401 S.E.2d 672, 675 (1991) (emphasis added).&nbsp; The PSC retained its duty to fix &quot;just and\r\nreasonable&quot; rates following the 2004 amendments to its role in ratemaking.&nbsp; Accordingly, the PSC is not precluded from considering fairness, provided\r\nit does so in the context of an objective and measurable framework.\r\nNevertheless, to the extent the PSC questioned the fairness of Utility's distribution-only rates solely because those rates were higher than the rates\r\ncharged by neighboring entities, the PSC erred as a matter of law.&nbsp; We have held on several occasions that it is improper for the PSC to draw comparisons\r\nwith other entities without stating its basis for finding the entities sufficiently similar for comparison purposes. &nbsp;E.g., Heater of Seabrook II,\r\n332 S.C. at 26, 503 S.E.2d at 742 (&quot;[T]he order refers to Carolina Water Service . . . as the comparison standard.&nbsp; However, there is no evidence\r\nwhatsoever in the record giving any information about Carolina Water Service. . . . [I]t would be impossible for an appellate court to afford meaningful review\r\nto any comparison findings regarding this utility.&quot;).\r\nOn remand, the PSC may consider whether the structure of the requested rate increase is unfair, such that a different method of raising the necessary\r\nrevenues might be preferable.&nbsp; See Seabrook Island Property Owners, 303 S.C. at 499, 401 S.E.2d at 675 (stating the PSC had a duty to\r\n&quot;distribute fairly the revenue requirements [of the utility]&quot;).&nbsp; It may not, however, require Utility to explain as a general matter why its\r\nrates are higher than the rates charged by other entities, absent a showing that those entities are sufficiently similar to the applicant to allow a meaningful\r\ncomparison.\r\nB. Recent Rate Increase\r\nA utility may file an application for a rate increase no more than once per year.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-240(F) (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010).&nbsp; Our case\r\nlaw suggests that a previous rate increase may provide a baseline for the PSC to use in determining whether a utility has incurred additional expenses requiring\r\nadditional revenue.&nbsp; Cf. Heater of Seabrook, Inc. v. Public Service Comm'n of S.C. (Heater of Seabrook I), 324 S.C. 56, 61, 478 S.E.2d\r\n826, 828 (1996) (&quot;To show that its expenses have increased, Heater need only introduce data comparing the expenses from the test year used in the previous\r\nrate case with those from the test year in this case . . . .&quot;).\r\nUtility argues, however, that the PSC used Utility's recent rate increase as part of its justification for denying the current rate application.&nbsp; To the\r\nextent the PSC did so, this was error.&nbsp; Cf. Heater of Seabrook II, 332 S.C. at 29, 503 S.E.2d at 743 (finding it was\r\n&quot;inappropriate&quot; for the PSC to rely in a 1997 order on its reasoning in a 1992 order granting an increase to the same company because &quot;this order\r\n. . . was based on evidence, and a prior test year, completely different from [the utility's] financial condition at the time of the current\r\napplication.&quot;).&nbsp; The PSC must not use the simple fact of a recent rate increase as a reason to deny a utility's rate application.&nbsp; An application\r\nfor a rate increase must stand or fall on its own merits.&nbsp; A recent rate increase provides only a starting point for determining whether a utility's rate\r\nbase or expenses have increased, such that additional revenues are required.\r\nVI.\r\nUtility and ORS have presented us with a dispute about the fundamental role of the PSC in ratemaking decisions post-2004.&nbsp; We hold the PSC has retained\r\nits role as the ultimate fact-finder.&nbsp; As such, it may consider all evidence before it and it does not serve as a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; for ORS's\r\nrecommendations.&nbsp; The PSC's powers are tempered, however, by its obligation to give a utility a meaningful opportunity to present additional evidence in\r\nsupport of its application.&nbsp; Moreover, the PSC must not deny an application in its entirety when only a small portion of the expenditures claimed by the\r\nutility have been called into question.&nbsp; Rather, the PSC must determine whether, even excluding the questioned expenditures, the utility is entitled to a\r\nrate increase.\r\nBecause we find the PSC's evaluation of Utility's rate application was affected by several errors of law, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nPLEICONES, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; ORS is nominally the Respondent, but it joins Appellant in seeking a reversal.&nbsp; The actions of the\r\nPSC have not been defended on appeal.\r\n[2]&nbsp; &quot;The 'rate base' is the amount of investment on which a regulated public utility is entitled to an\r\nopportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return.&quot;&nbsp; Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v.

(Heater of Seabrook II), 332 S.C. 20, 24 n.2, 503\r\nS.E.2d 739, 741 n.2 (1998).\r\n[3]&nbsp; In the context of water services, the term &quot;plant&quot; means &quot;[a]ll facilities owned by the\r\nutility for the collection, production, purification, storage, transmission, metering, and distribution of potable water.&quot;&nbsp; 26 S.C. Code Ann.

Code\r\nAnn. Regs. 103-502.13 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010).\r\n[4]&nbsp; Utility presented testimony that its current rate of return on rate base is 1.59%.&nbsp; The rate of\r\nreturn on rate base approved in Utility's 2006 rate case was 8.37%.\r\n[5]&nbsp; Haas also commented that customers might not be aware of the improvements Utility made in their\r\nneighborhoods.&nbsp; We note, however, that Haas testified Utility had &quot;an automatic message delivery system&quot; that provided &quot;specific information\r\nto customers in a particular geographic area or subdivision, advising them of upgrades or repairs being done to their system.&quot;\r\n[6]&nbsp; ORS calculated Utility's current rate of return on rate base as 2.85%.\r\n[7]&nbsp; In addition, we reject Utility's argument that a request for neighborhood-by-neighborhood data was\r\nunprecedented.

Milliman (Milliman), Consumer Benefits of America (CBA),\r\nNIA Corporation, MidAmerica Life Insurance Co. (MidAmerica), World Service Life Insurance Co., Provident American Life and Health Insurance Co. (Provident\r\nAmerican), Provident Indemnity Life Insurance Co. (Provident Indemnity), and Central Reserve Life Insurance Co. (Central Reserve) (collectively, Respondents)[1] for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA).\r\n&nbsp;This Court granted Petitioners' request for a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision in Turner v. Milliman,&nbsp;381 S.C. 101,\r\n671 S.E.2d 636&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) that affirmed as modified the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondents.\r\nFacts/Procedural History\r\nIn November 1996, John Turner (Turner) was employed at his family's radiator service business and was in need of health insurance coverage for himself and\r\nhis son.&nbsp; Petitioners contacted Milliman, a local insurance agent, to inquire about purchasing health insurance coverage.&nbsp; Petitioners and Milliman\r\ndiscussed Turner's health insurance options.&nbsp;\r\nTurner alleged Milliman represented to him that a group policy with CBA would be a good option because the future premiums would not increase as dramatically\r\nas the premiums with individual insurance plans.&nbsp; Turner also contended Milliman represented to him that group health insurance would be beneficial because\r\nof the following: (1) Turner was at an age when he could start developing medical problems and group coverage would allow him to keep his coverage; (2)\r\ncompanies writing individual insurance policies were going out of business and the prices of those policies were skyrocketing; (3) group health insurance\r\npremiums would not drastically change or dramatically increase; and (4) the only way people could afford insurance was to get group health insurance\r\ncoverage.&nbsp; Turner stated he was also told CBA would monitor the insurance industry and offer its members better coverage when better coverage was\r\navailable.&nbsp; Based on these alleged representations, Turner purchased health insurance through CBA.\r\nMidAmerica issued the coverage to Turner, and the coverage was concurrently assumed and reinsured by Provident Indemnity.[2]&nbsp; The following represents the increases in Turner's monthly premium:\r\n\r\n  November 1996:&nbsp;&nbsp; $101.70[3]\r\n  June 1997:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $109.70\r\n  June 1998:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $143.38\r\n  December 1998:&nbsp; $194.50\r\n  June 1999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $230.90\r\n  December 1999&nbsp;&nbsp; $271.95\r\n  June 2000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $331.81\r\n  December 2000&nbsp;&nbsp; $456.21\r\n  June 2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $646.19[4]\r\n  July 2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $799.61[5]\r\n\r\nTurner attested he anticipated increasing premiums, but by the end of 1999 he thought the increases were getting out of hand.\r\nIn June 2001, Provident American notified Turner his policy would be terminated on September 30, 2001.&nbsp; Turner was offered a different policy for the\r\nsame premium, $799.61, but with fewer benefits.&nbsp; Also in June 2001, the South Carolina Department of Insurance responded to an inquiry made by\r\nPetitioners.&nbsp; The Department of Insurance informed Petitioners that Turner purchased a group association policy which was not subject to rate approval by\r\nthe Department.&nbsp; Turner testified he attempted to find alternate healthcare coverage, but due to the onset of diabetes, no insurance company would insure\r\nhim.[6]&nbsp; Despite not obtaining other coverage, Turner declined the replacement coverage and has been without\r\nhealth insurance since September 2001.&nbsp;\r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment to Respondents, finding that (1) Petitioners' claims were barred by the three year statute of limitations, (2)\r\nMilliman's statements as to future events were not actionable, (3) allegations of unfair and deceptive practices in the context of insurance are not actionable\r\npursuant to SCUTPA, and (4) Charlotte Turner was not a proper party plaintiff.&nbsp; The court of appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment in relation to\r\nthe three year statute of limitations, finding it was a jury issue as to when Petitioners should have known of any potential claims.&nbsp; Turner, 381\r\nS.C. at 111, 671 S.E.2d at 642.&nbsp; However, the court of appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment regarding Milliman's alleged representations, finding\r\nthey were not actionable as mere statements of unfulfilled promises or statements as to future events and no evidence was presented to show Milliman made the\r\nstatements only to induce Petitioners to procure the policy.&nbsp; Id. at 113, 671 S.E.2d at 643.[7]&nbsp;\r\nIssue\r\nDid the court of appeals err in holding that summary judgment was properly based upon the finding that Milliman's statements regarding the insurance were\r\nmere unfulfilled promises or statements as to future events?\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen reviewing a grant of summary judgment, appellate courts apply the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; Fleming\r\nv. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860&nbsp;(2002) (citation omitted).&nbsp; Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions,\r\naffidavits, and discovery on file show there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.&nbsp; Id.;\r\nRule 56(c), SCRCP. &quot;When determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most\r\nfavorable to the non-moving party.&quot;&nbsp; Fleming, 350 S.C. at 493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860 (citation omitted).&nbsp; In order to withstand a motion\r\nfor summary judgment in cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of\r\nevidence.&nbsp; Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803&nbsp;(2009).&nbsp; In cases requiring a heightened burden of\r\nproof, the non-moving party must submit more than a mere scintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; Id. at 330-31, 673\r\nS.E.2d at 803.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioners argue the court of appeals erred in affirming the circuit court's grant of summary judgment because Milliman's statements were false statements\r\nof fact, which would support their fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims.&nbsp; Specifically, Petitioners contend the representation by Milliman that the\r\npolicy was a group policy presents a genuine issue of material fact such that the grant of summary judgment by the circuit court was improper.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nIn order to establish a claim for fraud in the inducement to enter a contract, a party must establish the following by clear and convincing evidence: (1) a\r\nrepresentation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the\r\nrepresentation be acted upon; (6) the hearer's ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearer's reliance on its truth; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon; and (9)\r\nthe hearer's consequent and proximate injury.&nbsp; M.B. Kahn Constr. Co. v. S.C. Nat'l Bank of Charleston, 275 S.C. 381, 384, 271 S.E.2d 414,\r\n415&nbsp;(1980).\r\nTo establish liability for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) the defendant made a false\r\nrepresentation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the representation; (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he\r\ncommunicated truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied\r\non the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance on the representation.&nbsp; Quail Hill, LLC\r\nv. County of Richland, 387 S.C. 223, 240, 692 S.E.2d 499, 508&nbsp;(2010); McLaughlin v. Williams, 379 S.C. 451, 456, 665 S.E.2d 667, 670&nbsp;(Ct.\r\nApp. 2008) (noting the elements of negligent misrepresentation must be established by a preponderance of the evidence).&nbsp; &quot;'Evidence of a mere broken\r\npromise is not sufficient to prove negligent misrepresentation.'&quot;&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 407, 581 S.E.2d 161,\r\n166&nbsp;(2003) (quoting Winburn v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 287 S.C. 435, 443, 339 S.E.2d 142, 147 (Ct. App. 1985)).\r\nOrdinarily, to be actionable, a statement must relate to a present or pre-existing fact, and cannot be predicated on unfulfilled promises or statements as to\r\nfuture events.&nbsp; Davis v. Upton,&nbsp;250 S.C. 288, 291, 157 S.E.2d 567, 568&nbsp;(1967).[8]&nbsp;\r\n&quot;However, where one promises to do a certain thing, having at the time no intention of keeping his agreement, it is a fraudulent misrepresentation of a\r\nfact, and actionable as such.&quot;&nbsp; Id. (citation omitted).&nbsp; &quot;[E]ntering into an agreement, with no intention of keeping such agreement,\r\nconstitutes fraudulent misrepresentation; however, mere breach of contract does not constitute fraud.&quot;&nbsp; Adams v. G.J. Creel and Sons, Inc., 320\r\nS.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85&nbsp;(1995).&nbsp; A future promise is not fraudulent unless such promise was part of a general design or plan, existing at the\r\ntime, to induce a party to enter into a contract or act as he or she otherwise would not have acted, to his or her injury.&nbsp; Bishop Logging Co. v. John\r\nDeere Indus. Equip. Co., 317 S.C. 520, 527, 455 S.E.2d 183, 187&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995) (quoting Coleman v. Stevens,&nbsp;124 S.C. 8, 16, 117\r\nS.E. 305, 307&nbsp;(1923)).&nbsp; &quot;Evidence of mere nonperformance of a promise is not sufficient to establish either fraud or a lack of intent to\r\nperform.&quot;&nbsp; Woods v. State, 314 S.C. 501, 506, 431 S.E.2d 260, 263&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993) (citation omitted).&nbsp; An inference of a lack of\r\nintent to perform a promise can only be made when nonobservance of a promise is coupled with other evidence.&nbsp; Id. (citation omitted).\r\nUnder the elements for both fraud and negligent misrepresentation, the representation at issue must be false.&nbsp; See Fields v. Melrose Ltd. P'ship,\r\n312 S.C. 102, 105, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) (&quot;To be actionable, the representation must relate to a present or pre-existing fact and be false\r\nwhen made.&quot;).&nbsp; Respondents argue the health insurance policy sold to Turner was a group health insurance policy.&nbsp; The Certificate of Insurance of\r\nboth the MidAmerica and Provident American insurance policies states, &quot;This certificate summarizes the provisions of the Group Policy that are important to\r\nyou . . . . The Group Policy, alone, constitutes the entire contract under which rights and benefits are provided.&quot;&nbsp; Moreover, Dr. Tim Ryles, an\r\nexpert in insurance regulation, testified the insurance coverage purchased by Petitioners was a group insurance policy.&nbsp; Respondents also contend\r\nPetitioners' belief that the policy was not a group policy is based on a misunderstanding about how coverage is issued under the policy.&nbsp; At all times when\r\nTurner's health insurance was in effect, CBA was identified as the policyholder to which the master group policy of insurance was issued.&nbsp; Within that\r\nframework, Turner completed an individual application, a term specifically defined within the group policy, to obtain coverage under the group policy.&nbsp;\r\nPetitioners point to a certificate issued November 6, 2001 by Provident Indemnity which states the coverage issued was individual coverage.&nbsp; Petitioners\r\nnote this correspondence stands in sharp contrast to other correspondence from the same company stating the product was group coverage.&nbsp; Petitioners also\r\npoint to a letter from Continental General Insurance Company dated July 18, 2001 stating Turner was not eligible for insurance coverage because he was trying to\r\nreplace an individual policy.&nbsp; We find this evidence meets the scintilla of evidence standard such that a grant of summary judgment as to the negligent\r\nmisrepresentation claim was inappropriate.&nbsp; However, the fraud claim requires proof by clear and convincing evidence; thus, more than a mere scintilla of\r\nevidence must be presented to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; See Hancock, 381 S.C. at 330-31, 673 S.E.2d at 803.&nbsp; Due to\r\nthe heightened standard of review applied to fraud claims, we find the grant of summary judgment on the fraud claim appropriate.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nConclusion\r\nPetitioners have presented at least a scintilla of evidence that the policy issued was an individual policy, not a group policy.&nbsp; Hence, the grant of\r\nsummary judgment on the negligent misrepresentation claim is reversed.&nbsp; However, due to the heightened standard of review regarding fraud, the grant of\r\nsummary judgment on the fraud claim is affirmed.&nbsp;\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Of these, Milliman, CBA, MidAmerica, Provident American, Provident Indemnity, and Central Reserve are the\r\nRespondents.&nbsp;\r\n[2] In May 1997, this policy was terminated and assumed by Provident American.\r\n[3] This is the original monthly premium paid by Turner.\r\n[4] CBA informed Turner that this increase was due to increased research and development healthcare costs.\r\n[5] CBA informed Turner that this increase was due to rising healthcare costs as well as substantial losses\r\nsustained by Provident American.&nbsp;\r\n[6] Turner developed diabetes in June 1997.\r\n[7] The court of appeals did not address the remaining issues on appeal because disposition of this issue was\r\ndispositive of the appeal.&nbsp; See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598&nbsp;(1999) (citation\r\nomitted) (finding appellate court need not review remaining issues when determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n[8] See Sauner, 354 S.C. at 408, 581 S.E.2d at 167&nbsp;(2003) (applying the same rule to negligent\r\nmisrepresentation cases).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
