Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Benjamin Aplin, of S.C. Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant contends the circuit court erred in revoking six months of his probation because the revocation was not predicated on appellantâ€™s violation of a condition of probation imposed by the sentencing judge.Â  We agree and reverse the partial revocation.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was on probation following 2002 convictions for stalking and domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature.Â  In 2005, appellant was alleged to have violated certain of his probationary conditions. Furthermore, a woman with whom he had been cohabiting complained to respondent Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services (DPPPS) that while she had ended a romantic relationship with appellant, he â€œrefused to leave her alone.â€Â  In lieu of issuing a probation revocation warrant based upon the alleged violations, DPPPS entered an agreement with appellant in June 2005 whereby appellant consented to participate in DPPPSâ€™ Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Program.Â  Under this agreement, appellant agreed not only to be electronically monitored, but also to avoid certain â€œexclusion zonesâ€ areas near the former girlfriendâ€™s home and work.Â \r\n \r\nIn August 2005, DPPPS issued a probation revocation warrant alleging appellant had violated his probation by â€œentering a known exclusion zoneâ€ established by the June 2005 agreement.Â  At the circuit court hearing, appellant argued that the violation of a non-judicially mandated term could not be the basis for a probation revocation.Â  Specifically, appellant argued that such a revocation would violate the separation of powers doctrine as enunciated in State v. Archie, 322 S.C. 135, 470 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The judge revoked six months for appellantâ€™s violation of an exclusion zone.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether the circuit court erred in revoking appellantâ€™s probation where he did not violate a judicially imposed condition?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends his violation of an exclusion zone established by his GPS agreement with DPPPS cannot be the basis for a probation violation.Â  Under the facts of this case, we agree.\r\nDPPPS acknowledges that revoking appellantâ€™s probation for his violation of a non-judicially imposed term would have violated the separation of powers doctrine under the version of Â§ 24-21-430 in effect when State v. Archie was decided.Â  DPPPS contends, however, that any such constitutional problem was eliminated by a 1996 amendment to the statute.Â  The current version of Â§ 24-21-430 retains the language affirming the sentencing courtâ€™s authority to â€œimposeâ€¦andâ€¦at any time modify the conditions of probationâ€¦â€ but adds these sentences:\r\n\r\n\tTo effectively supervise probationers, the [DPPPS] director shall develop policies and procedures for imposing conditions of supervision on probationers.Â  These conditions may enhance but must not diminish court imposed conditions.\r\n\r\nWe agree with DPPPS that the statutory change authorizes it to create policies and procedures which implement and support â€œconditions of supervision on probationers.â€ Â (emphasis added).Â  To read the statute as DPPPS urges, however, as authorizing it to add conditions of probation, would render the statute violative of the constitutional requirement of separation of powers.Â  It is well-settled that the determination of those conditions is a judicial function which cannot, consonant with S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 8, be delegated to an executive agency such as DPPPS.Â  State v. Archie, supra.Â  \r\n \r\nThe statute permits DPPPS to impose â€œconditions of supervisionâ€ which â€œenhanceâ€¦court imposed conditionsâ€ of probation.Â  Under the statute, one requirement which a court may impose as a condition of probation is that the probationer â€œsubmit to intensive surveillance which may include surveillance by electronic means.â€Â  Section 24-21-430(11).Â  Where condition 11 is imposed by the court, DPPPS may require the probationer to participate in the GPS program as a condition of supervision under Â§ 24-21-430 because this program would â€œenhanceâ€¦court-imposed conditionsâ€Â  Under these circumstances, a violation of GPS monitoring would be a violation of the â€œenhanced court imposed conditionsâ€ and therefore grounds for a revocation.Â  In this case, however, the sentencing court chose not to require appellant to â€œsubmit to intensive surveillance;â€ DPPPS therefore could not unilaterally impose GPS monitoring on appellant as this method of supervision did not enhance a judicially-ordered condition of probation.Â  Nothing prevented DPPPS and appellant from reaching an agreement whereby appellant would participate in the program.Â  While appellantâ€™s failure to abide by the â€œexclusion zoneâ€ was a breach of his agreement with DPPPS, it was not a violation of the conditions of his probation.Â  Under these circumstances, the circuit court erred in revoking a portion of appellantâ€™s probation.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order revoking six months of appellantâ€™s probationary sentence is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J.

Bunch, Op. No. 2004-UP-550 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 27, 2004), in which the court ordered a new trial due to the trial courtâ€™s failure to exclude evidence of plaintiffâ€™s pre-accident alcohol consumption.Â  We reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the original jury verdicts in favor of Bunch.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arises out of a 1997 traffic accident involving John David Lee (Lee) and Robert Allen Bunch (Bunch).Â  The motorcycle driven by Lee hit the driverâ€™s side of Bunchâ€™s automobile, as Bunch was moving perpendicularly across Old Dunbar Road, a two-lane highway in Lexington County.Â  \r\n \r\nThe parties presented conflicting accounts of how the accident happened.Â  Lee claimed that Bunch negligently attempted a U-turn or three-point turn from the right shoulder of the road where his car had been parked, while Bunch testified he was trying to make a left turn from the roadway into the parking lot of his fiancÃ©â€™s place of employment, Johnny Bâ€™s Bar and Grill.Â  The parties also disputed the time of the accident, with Bunch claiming the collision occurred at â€œdusk-darkâ€[1] and Lee contending it occurred around 10:30 p.m.Â  \r\n \r\nLee suffered numerous broken bones, a head injury, and a severe groin injury as a result of the accident.Â  Trooper P.A. Nelson of the South Carolina Highway Patrol was the investigating officer and met with Lee later that night in the emergency room.Â  During their conversation, Trooper Nelson smelled alcohol on Lee and requested a blood sample be drawn.Â  The test conducted by SLED indicated Lee had a blood alcohol level of 0.036%.\r\nAt a pre-trial hearing, Lee moved to exclude any evidence of his alcohol consumption.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption would be probative as to the determination of liability.[2]Â   \r\nLee later testified that he left a family birthday party at Murrayâ€™s Bar and Grill shortly before the accident occurred.Â  He recalled having two liquor drinks along with dinner.Â  Lee stated he was on his way to the Skyline Club, a bar and dance hall, when he collided with Bunch.Â  After Leeâ€™s testimony, Bunch moved to amend his answer to include the affirmative defense of comparative negligence.Â  The trial court later granted the motion.Â  \r\n \r\nThe jury returned a defense verdict, assigning 70% of the fault to Lee and 30% to Bunch.Â  The jury also returned a verdict in favor of Bunch on Mrs. Leeâ€™s loss of consortium claim.Â  The trial court ruled that the verdicts were inconsistent because Mrs. Lee was entitled to recover damages due to the juryâ€™s finding that Bunch was partially negligent.[3]Â  The trial judge then instructed the jury to determine some amount of damages for Mrs. Lee.Â  After deliberating again, the jury awarded a total of $9,000.00 to Mrs. Lee.Â  \r\n \r\nEach party appealed to the Court of Appeals.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow evidence of Leeâ€™s pre-accident alcohol consumption and remanded for a new trial.Â  The Court of Appeals did not address the other issues raised by Bunch or Mrs. Lee.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow evidence of Leeâ€™s pre-accident alcohol consumption?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe trial court analyzed the admissibility of the alcohol evidence under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  An appellate court reviews Rule 403 rulings pursuant to an abuse of discretion standard and gives great deference to the trial court.Â  State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 48, 596 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2004).Â  See also State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œA trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.â€).\r\nThe Court of Appeals found that the probative value of Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption was at best, slight.Â  The court focused on the fact that Leeâ€™s blood alcohol level was under the legal limit pursuant to the driving under the influence (DUI) statute.[4]Â  Furthermore, the Court of Appeals emphasized that no specific evidence was presented to show Leeâ€™s impairment.Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough Leeâ€™s blood alcohol level did not implicate a criminal DUI offense, testimony of Bunchâ€™s experts constituted probative evidence of Leeâ€™s impairment that arguably contributed to the accident.Â  Bunchâ€™s experts, relying on the blood alcohol level of 0.036% taken several hours after the accident occurred, estimated that Leeâ€™s blood alcohol level at the time of the collision was closer to 0.066%-0.096%. Â At that level, according to Bunchâ€™s experts, Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption would have negatively affected Leeâ€™s judgment and his ability to multi-task, thus impairing his motorcycle driving skills.Â \r\n \r\nOther evidence tended to show Lee was carelessly operating his motorcycle when the accident occurred.Â  An eyewitness to the accident, Chong Abernathy, estimated Leeâ€™s speed at 40-45 miles per hour, which was five to ten miles per hours over the posted limit on that road.Â  In addition, Trooper Nelson concluded that the impact occurred left of the center line.Â \r\n \r\nBecause there is evidence that supports Bunchâ€™s argument that alcohol affected Leeâ€™s ability to safely operate his motorcycle, this case differs from Kennedy v. Griffin, 358 S.C. 122, 595 S.E.2d 248 (Ct. App. 2004), which was relied upon by the Court of Appeals.Â  In Kennedy, the Court of Appeals held that evidence of the mere presence of marijuana in the plaintiffâ€™s system, without further indication of impairment, could mislead the jury and should have been excluded under Rule 403.Â  In this case, however, Lee admitted drinking shortly before the accident and there was additional proof of impairment, albeit by inference.Â  See Gulledge v. McLaughlin, 328 S.C. 504, 492 S.E.2d 816 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding blood alcohol level relevant and thus admissible because corroborating evidence, including circumstances of accident, supported claim that driver was impaired).Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe expert evidence concerning Leeâ€™s potential impairment, coupled with evidence of speeding and a point of impact left of the center line, supports the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny Leeâ€™s motion to exclude alcohol evidence under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The circumstances surrounding Bunchâ€™s version of the accident, i.e. that Lee inexplicably ran into Bunchâ€™s automobile, would be more probable if Lee was impaired.Â  Even though the admission of alcohol evidence was prejudicial to Lee, the prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the alcohol evidence in determining fault.Â \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to deny Leeâ€™s motion under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court and ordering a new trial.Â  Because the parties raised additional issues which were not addressed by the Court of Appeals, we briefly address those issues.\r\nAmendment of Bunchâ€™s Answer\r\nLee argues the trial court erred in allowing Bunch to amend his answer to include the affirmative defense of comparative negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt a pre-trial hearing, the trial court ruled that Bunch would be permitted to introduce evidence of Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption.Â  On the second day of trial and after Leeâ€™s testimony, Bunch moved to amend his answer to assert the affirmative defense of comparative negligence.Â  The trial court later heard arguments on the motion and then granted the motion to amend, citing a lack of prejudice to the plaintiffs.\r\nThe failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a waiver of the right to assert it.Â  Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 220, 574 S.E.2d 200, 202 (2002).Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP, provides an exception to the waiver rule by permitting a party to amend his pleadings to conform to the evidence.Â  The rule provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadingsâ€¦If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the meritsâ€¦\r\n\r\nRule 15(b), SCRCP.Â  The circuit court is to freely grant leave to amend when justice requires, and there is no prejudice to any other party.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 313, 566 S.E.2d 529, 535 (2002).Â  A motion to amend is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.Â  Id. Â Amendments to conform to the proof should be liberally allowed when no prejudice to the opposing party will result.Â  Id.\r\nAt trial, the degree of Leeâ€™s fault clearly became an issue in this case.Â  Although Lee did not consent to the introduction of alcohol into the case, Lee never objected to the evidence of his speeding nor his driving left of center.Â  Thus, comparative negligence was tried by implied consent because the parties addressed an issue not raised in the pleadings that later entered the case.Â  See Sunvillas Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Square D. Co., 301 S.C. 330, 335, 391 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1990); Fraternal Order of Police v. S.C. Dept. of Revenue, 352 S.C. 420, 435, 574 S.E.2d 717, 725 (2002) (â€œIn order to be tried by implied consent, the issue must have been discussed extensively at trial.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nThe question then becomes whether Lee suffered any prejudice by allowing Bunch to amend his answer to include comparative negligence.Â  Lee argues that even if we find he consented to a trial on comparative negligence, he was still prejudiced by the amendment.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe prejudice that would warrant denial of a motion to amend the pleadings is a lack of notice that a new issue is to be tried and a lack of opportunity to refute it.Â  Collins Entertainment, Inc. v. White,Â  363 S.C. 546, 562, 611 S.E.2d 262, 270 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Prejudice occurs when the amendment states a new defense which would require the opposing party to introduce additional or different evidence to prevail in the amended action.Â  Ball v. Canadian Am. Exp. Co., 314 S.C. 272, 275, 442 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nAlthough the issue of comparative negligence was not specifically part of the case until after Lee presented his case, there is no indication that Lee would have presented additional or different evidence especially geared towards comparative negligence.Â  First, Lee was well aware that alcohol would be an issue in the case by virtue of the trial courtâ€™s pre-trial hearing, and he undoubtedly attempted to present a case that minimized the effect his alcohol consumption might have in assigning fault.Â  Secondly, Lee claims that he was not allowed to question two eyewitnesses, Greg Jones and Chong Abernathy, concerning excessive speed and driving left of the center line because they had been released from their subpoenas before Bunch amended his answer.Â  However, both Jones and Abernathy testified extensively as to where Bunch and Lee were situated at the time of the accident, and Abernathy was the first witness to mention Leeâ€™s speeding.Â  Finally, Lee presented his own expert witness in rebuttal to counter Bunchâ€™s expert witnesses.Â  Accordingly, Lee has failed to prove prejudice by the amendment of Bunchâ€™s answer to include the defense of comparative negligence.\r\nInconsistent Verdicts\r\nOn Leeâ€™s claim, the jury returned a verdict of comparative negligence, assigning 70% of the fault to Lee and 30% to Bunch.Â  On a separate verdict form, the jury returned a defense verdict in favor of Bunch on Mrs. Leeâ€™s loss of consortium claim.Â  The trial court, over Bunchâ€™s objection, found the verdicts to be inconsistent because the jury found Bunch to be 30% negligent, which would require an award of some amount to Mrs. Lee due to her lack of fault.Â  The trial judge sent Mrs. Leeâ€™s case back to the jury with an instruction that the jury must award some amount other than zero.Â \r\n \r\nBunch contends that the trial court erred in finding inconsistent verdicts and instructing the jury to award some amount of damages to Mrs. Lee.Â  He argues that the original defense verdict on Mrs. Leeâ€™s loss of consortium claim should be reinstated.Â  We agree.\r\nThe original verdicts were consistent.Â  In South Carolina, claims for personal injuries and for loss of consortium are separate and distinct.Â  Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 231, 584 S.E.2d 423, 430 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 397, 321 S.E.2d 40, 43 (1984)). Â Â Moreover, it is not inconsistent for the jury to return a verdict for the injured spouse on the primary claim and a verdict for the defendant on the loss of consortium claim.Â  See Craven v. Cunningham, 292 S.C. 441, 443, 357 S.E.2d 23, 25 (1987) (juryâ€™s award to injured spouse while denying wifeâ€™s consortium claim was consistent because wifeâ€™s claim was contested throughout trial); Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 574 S.E.2d 215 (S.C. App. 2002) (â€œ[W]e find this is not sufficient to say that a plaintiffâ€™s verdict on wrongful death and a defense verdict on loss of consortium are inconsistent.â€); Daves, supra (after finding for injured husband on medical malpractice claim, it was not inconsistent for jury to find for defendant on wifeâ€™s consortium claim because â€œthe jury obviously rejected her testimony, as was their prerogative.â€). \r\n \r\nIf it is proper for the jury to deny a loss of consortium claim when it has found the defendant liable on the primary claim, the jury could consistently return a defense verdict on Mrs. Leeâ€™s consortium claim when it found in favor of the defendant on the primary claim.Â  However, two prior cases have found that a spouse claiming loss of consortium should have been awarded damages by virtue of a verdict in favor of the injured spouse.Â  See Page v. Crisp, 303 S.C. 117, 399 S.E.2d 161 (Ct. App. 1990); Sullivan v. Davis, 317 S.C. 462, 454 S.E.2d 907 (Ct. App. 1995).Â Â  These cases differ from the present case.\r\nIn Page and Sullivan, the defendant was liable on the primary claim.Â  Here, the jury determined Bunch was not liable on Leeâ€™s primary negligence claim.Â  As such, Bunch should not be forced to pay all of Mrs. Leeâ€™s damages if he only contributed 30% to the accident.Â  â€œGenerally, a plaintiff spouseâ€™s claim for loss of consortium fails if the impaired spouseâ€™s claim fails, whether the claim is considered separate and independent from the impaired spouseâ€™s claim or derivative in nature.â€Â  41 Am.Jur.2d Husband and Wife Â§ 227 (2007) (citing Smith v. Ridgeway Chem., Inc., 302 S.C. 303, 395 S.E.2d 742 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding husband could not recover on loss of consortium because the jury found that the wife was not entitled to recover on her strict liability claim)).Â  Bunch also contested some of Mrs. Leeâ€™s testimony in regards to her lost wages.Â  See Craven, supra.Â  Accordingly, because the original verdicts were not inconsistent, the trial court erred in re-submitting Mrs. Leeâ€™s consortium claim to the jury.\r\nWe address Leeâ€™s remaining issues and affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Issue 1 (directed verdict/JNOV): Strange v. S.C. Dept. of Hwy. and Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 445 S.E.2d 439 (1994) (motions for directed verdict and JNOV should be denied where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt); and Issue 2 (jury charge on negligence per se): Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999) (a jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law).Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that the trial court properly allowed evidence of Leeâ€™s pre-accident alcohol consumption.Â  We also affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow Bunch to amend his answer.Â  Finally, we reverse the trial court and hold that the original defense verdicts in favor of Bunch on both the primary negligence claim and the loss of consortium claim are not inconsistent.Â  Accordingly, we reinstate both verdicts, including the loss of consortium defense verdict in favor of Bunch.\r\nREVERSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On cross-examination, Bunch admitted that in his deposition, he recalled the accident occurring in the â€œdaytime.â€Â  However, both in his deposition and at trial, Bunch stated that he was not exactly sure what time the accident happened.\r\n[2] The trial judge stated, â€œI think itâ€™s probative as to the fact as to whether or not [Leeâ€™s] version of the facts is true, because a jury would be wondering, well, why would this guy just run into the side of this car, and if [Bunchâ€™s] version is true, and one possible explanation is, well, heâ€™d been drinking.â€Â  \r\n \r\n[3] On Mr. Leeâ€™s verdict form the jury answered â€œyesâ€ to the question, â€œDo you find that the defendant was negligent and that his negligence proximately caused the plaintiffâ€™s injuries?â€ \r\n \r\n[4] S.C.

Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1995).Â  A 12(b)(6) motion should not be granted if â€œfacts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case.â€ Id. Â The question is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for relief. Â Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987).Â  Further, the complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the action. Â Id. \r\n\r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Common Law Judicial Immunity\r\nPlyler contends the trial court erred in granting HCPCâ€™s motion to dismiss on the basis of the common law doctrine of judicial immunity.Â  We disagree.\r\nJudicial immunity serves as a bar to litigation against a judicial officer in certain circumstances.Â  Oâ€™Laughlin v. Windham, 330 S.C. 379, 385, 498 S.E.2d 689, 692 (Ct. App. 1998). Â This immunity, however, is not absolute. Â â€œ[J]udges and other officials are not entitled to judicial immunity if: (1) they did not have jurisdiction to act; (2) the act did not serve a judicial function; or (3) the suit is for prospective, injunctive relief only.â€Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 541 (2002) (internal citations omitted). \r\n \r\nThe majority of Plylerâ€™s argument against the application of common law judicial immunity is based on whether HCPC was performing a judicial act when supervising Plylerâ€™s conservatorship estate.Â  Plyler does not dispute the jurisdiction of the probate court.Â  Plyler does, however, contend that her claims against HCPC involve prospective, injunctive relief because she requests an accounting and relief from HCPCâ€™s orders.Â \r\n \r\nFirst, assuming the requested accounting qualifies as injunctive relief, Plyler has made no allegation that HCPC ever possessed any property or money on her behalf.Â  Therefore, the request for an accounting has no application to HCPC.Â  Second, Plylerâ€™s requested relief from HCPCâ€™s orders does not require any injunctive action against HCPC, but instead implies injunctive relief against any of the other defendants seeking to utilize those orders in their defense.Â  Accordingly, the prospective, injunction relief exception to judicial immunity has no application to HCPC.Â \r\n \r\nFor these reasons, we focus our analysis on the determination of whether HCPC performed a judicial act in supervising the management ofÂ  Plylerâ€™s conservatorship.\r\nIn determining whether an act serves a judicial function, the Court must look to the nature and function of the act as opposed to the title of the person committing the act.Â  Id. at 325, 566 S.E.2d at 541.Â  The line must be drawn between acts which are truly judicial and those acts which simply happen to have been performed by a judge.Â  Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 227 (1988).Â  \r\n \r\nIn Forrester, the United States Supreme Court discussed the difference between â€œjudicial acts and the administrative, legislative, or executive functions that judges may on occasion be assigned by law to perform.â€Â  Id.Â Â  When a court undertakes any adjudicative act within its jurisdiction, regardless of allegations of malicious or corrupt motive, the act is considered a judicial function for which the court will have absolute immunity.Â  Id.Â  However, â€œ[a]dministrative decisions, even though they may be essential to the very functioning of the courts, have not similarly been regarded as judicial acts.â€Â  Id. at 228.Â  Furthermore, judicial immunity has not been applied to a judgeâ€™s action pursuant to rulemaking authority.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nIn South Carolina, the probate court has jurisdiction to determine the need for the protection of the minorâ€™s assets.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-402 (2005).Â  Section 62-5-402 provides:\r\n\r\n\tAfter the service of notice in a proceeding seeking the appointment of a conservator or other protective order and until termination of the proceeding, the probate court in which the petition is filed has:\r\n\t(1) exclusive jurisdiction to determine the need for a conservator or other protective order until the proceedings are terminated;\r\n\t(2) exclusive jurisdiction to determine how the estate of the protected person which is subject to the laws of this State must be managed, expended, or distributed to or for the use of the protected person or any of his dependents; and\r\n\t(3) concurrent jurisdiction to determine the validity of claims for or against the person or estate of the protected person except as limited by Section 62-5-433.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, Plyler alleges that HCPC negligently supervised the management of her conservatorship estate.Â  Plyler contends that the courtâ€™s act of supervising a conservator is fundamentally an administrative act because it requires only the handling of paperwork and other clerical actions.Â  In support of this contention, Plyler relies on the deposition testimony of Burns stating that he rarely discussed the handling of the conservatorship with the judge, he never appeared in the actual courtroom, and he conducted most of his interaction with the staff of the probate court over the phone.\r\n \r\nDespite Plyerâ€™s contention, the informality of Burnsâ€™ interaction with the probate court is not determinative of the character of the courtâ€™s acts.Â  Although a cursory examination of the relationship between a conservator and the probate court may appear to require only the handling of paperwork, the probate courtâ€™s role is actually much more involved.Â  In accordance with the statutory jurisdiction in Â§ 62-4-502, the probate court has the responsibility to determine whether the conservatorship estate of the minor is effectively â€œmanaged, expended, or distributed to or for the use of the protected person or any of his dependents.â€Â  These determinations involve an adjudication of whether the conservator is acting within the confines of the law with respect to the management of the conservatorship.Â  Such determinations are precisely the type of judicial acts to which immunity applies.Â \r\n \r\nBecause Plylerâ€™s allegations involving HCPC concern only those acts which would be considered judicial in nature, we find that the trial court did not err in granting HCPCâ€™s motion to dismiss based on common law judicial immunity.\r\nII.&nbsp; Waiver\r\nPlyler argues the trial court erred in considering HCPCâ€™s motion to dismiss because HCPC waived its right to assert common law judicial immunity.Â  Particularly, Plyler contends that HCPC did not satisfy the pleading requirements for affirmative defenses in accordance with Rule 8(c), SCRCP, because HCPC included the defense of judicial immunity in its memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss, but not in the motion to dismiss itself.Â  We disagree.\r\nImmunity is an affirmative defense which must be pled.Â  Rayfield v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 297 S.C. 95, 105, 374 S.E.2d 910, 915 (Ct. App. 1988); see Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  Generally, â€œa failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a waiver of the right to assert it.â€Â  Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 220, 574 S.E.2d 200, 202 (2002).Â  However, because the aim of this pleading requirement is to avoid surprise defenses, see Rule 8(c), SCRCP note, many courts allow the assertion of affirmative defenses despite a technical failure to comply with the initial pleading requirements where the defense is timely raised to the trial court without resulting in unfair surprise to the opposing party.Â  See Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, 180 F.3d 598, 612 (4th Cir. 1999), abrogated on other grounds by Dessert Palace Inc. v. Costai, 539 U.S. 90 (2003); and Floyd v. Ohio Gen. Ins. Co., 701 F.Supp. 1177, 1187 (D.S.C. 1988).Â  See also Gardner v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, Inc., 304 S.C. 328, 404 S.E.2d 200 (1991) (providing that where there are no South Carolina cases directly on point, the Court may look to the construction placed on the corresponding federal rules of civil procedure).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nThis Court has not addressed the issue presented in the instant case, however, the court of appeals decided a similar issue in the case of Wright v. Sparrow, 298 S.C. 469, 470, 381 S.E.2d 503, 504 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  In Wright, the plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant because the notice of the motion failed to specify the particular grounds for the motion.Â  Id.Â  The notice indicated that the motion would be â€œbased on the attached affidavits and memorandum in support of the motion.â€Â  The memorandum in support of the motion set forth the exact bases for the motion.Â  Id. at 471, 381 S.E.2d at 505.Â  The court of appeals found that the trial court properly considered the arguments presented in the summary judgment motion and supporting memorandum despite the defendantâ€™s failure to include the specific grounds in the notice.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn the instant case, HCPC timely filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The motion outlined HCPCâ€™s position that Plylerâ€™s claim was barred by the exceptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in the Tort Claims Act, including the judicial acts exception.Â  The motion did not include the affirmative defense of common law judicial immunity. Â However, HCPC indicated that the grounds for the motion would be more fully discussed in the supporting memorandum.Â  The supporting memorandum detailed the grounds for dismissal included in the motion, and also included the defense of common law judicial immunity.Â  Plyler received the supporting memorandum several days before the hearing.Â \r\n \r\nAs a practical matter, the analysis of judicial immunity pursuant to both the Tort Claims Act and the common law is substantially similar.Â  See Faile v. South Carolina Dept. of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 566 S.E.2d 536 (2002) (discussing â€œjudicial actâ€ under the common law and the Tort Claims Act).Â Â  Plyler concedes that she received timely notice of HCPCâ€™s assertion of judicial immunity pursuant to the Tort Claims Act.Â  In light of these circumstances, Plyler has not demonstrated that she suffered prejudice or unfair surprise in any way.\r\nTherefore, we find that although HCPC failed to include the affirmative defense of common law judicial immunity in its motion to dismiss, HCPCâ€™s inclusion of the defense in the supporting memorandum was sufficient to comply with the intent of Rule 8(c), SCRCP, in this case.Â Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in considering the issue of common law judicial immunity in the hearing on HCPCâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â \r\n \r\nAlternatively, Plyler argues that the court erred in failing to grant her a continuance in order to prepare her argument in opposition to HCPC claim of common law judicial immunity.Â  Plyler contends that HCPCâ€™s failure to comply with the time requirements of Rule 6(d), SCRCP, and its failure to comply with the specificity requirements of Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP, caused her to suffer prejudice and deprived her of due process.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe grant or denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and is reviewable on appeal only when an abuse of discretion appears from the record. Â Bridwell v. Bridwell, 279 S.C. 111, 112, 302 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1983). Moreover, the denial of a motion for a continuance on the ground that counsel has not had time to prepare is rarely disturbed on appeal. Â See State v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451, 385 S.E.2d 827 (1989).\r\nRule 6(d), SCRCP, provides in part that â€œa written motion . . . and notice of the hearing thereof, shall be served not later than ten days before the time specified for the hearing, unless a different period is fixed by these rules or by an order of the court.â€Â  Additionally, Rule 7(d)(1), SCRCP states that â€œan application to the court for an order shall be by motion which . . . shall state with particularity the grounds therefor.â€Â  However, where noncompliance with the technical requirements of the rules causes no prejudicial effect, failure by the trial court to grant a continuance on that basis is harmless error. McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\n \r\nPlyler correctly asserts that HCPC did not comply with the technical requirements of Rules 6(d) and 7(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  However, Plylerâ€™s claims that she had insufficient time to prepare for the hearing are misleading.Â  Because the defenses of judicial immunity pursuant to the Tort Claims Act and the common law require similar analysis, and because Plyler received adequate notice of HCPCâ€™s assertion of judicial immunity under the Tort Claims Act, we find that Plyler cannot make the requisite showing of prejudice necessary to reverse the trial courtâ€™s denial of her motion for a continuance.Â Â \r\n \r\nBecause Plyler suffered no prejudice from HCPCâ€™s assertion of common law judicial immunity in its memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss, the trial court did not err in denying Plylerâ€™s request for a continuance.\r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; Tort Claims Act\r\nPlyler argues that the trial court erred in declining to apply a gross negligence standard in its review of HCPCâ€™s entitlement to immunity under the Tort Claims Act.Â  Specifically, Plyler alleges that the trial court should have applied the gross negligence standard contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-60(12) and (25) to all exceptions asserted by HCPC.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Tort Claims Act provides that â€œthe State, an agency, a political subdivision, and a governmental entity are liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations upon liability and damages, and exemptions from liability and damages contained herein.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-78-40 (2005).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe burden of establishing a limitation upon liability or an exception to the waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act is upon the governmental entity asserting it as an affirmative defense. Â Provisions establishing limitations upon and exemptions from liability of a governmental entity must be liberally construed in favor of limiting liability.\r\n\r\nSteinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 393, 520 S.E.2d 142, 152 (1999).\r\nWhen a governmental entity asserts an exception to the waiver of immunity and any other applicable exception contains a gross negligence standard, the Court must read the gross negligence standard into all of the exceptions under which the entity seeks immunity.Â  Â See id. at 394, 520 S.E.2d at 153.Â  Gross negligence is defined as â€œthe failure to exercise slight care.â€ Â Id. at 395, 520 S.E.2d at 153.Â  It has also been defined as â€œthe intentional, conscious failure to do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.â€ Gross negligence â€œis a relative term, and means the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.â€ Â Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nHCPC asserted several exceptions to the waiver of immunity contained in the Tort Claims Act, includingÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-60(1), (2), and (3) (2005) as a bar to Plylerâ€™s claims.Â  These sections provide that a â€œgovernmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from: (1) legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction; (2) administrative action or inaction of a legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial nature; [or] (3) execution, enforcement, or implementation of the orders of any court or execution, enforcement, or lawful implementation of any process.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe trial court granted HCPCâ€™s motion to dismiss based in part on these exceptions.Â  Plyer, however, asked the court to consider the additional exceptions contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-60(12) and (25).Â  Plyler contends that these sections applied to HCPC and also required the court to apply the gross negligence standard to all other exceptions asserted by HCPC.Â \r\n \r\nSection 15-78-60(12) provides an exception to the waiver of immunity where the â€œlicensing powers or functions including, but not limited to, the issuance, denial, suspension, renewal, or revocation of or failure or refusal to issue, deny, suspend, renew, or revoke any permit, license, certificate, approval, registration, order, or similar authority except when the power or function is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.â€Â  Generally, this exception is applied where a governmental agency actually engages in licensing functions.Â  See Steinke, 336 S.C. at 373, 520 S.E.2d at 152 (holding that the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation was grossly negligent in failing to revoke a permit at an amusement park).Â  \r\n \r\nSection 15-78-60(25) provides an exemption to the waiver of immunity where the â€œresponsibility or duty including but not limited to supervision, protection, control, confinement, or custody of any student, patient, prisoner, inmate, or client of any governmental entity, except when the responsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.â€Â  The section is usually applied in situations where a governmental entity is responsible for the actual physical accountability for the person and not merely the personâ€™s interest in property.Â  See Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003) (holding the county detention center responsible for the conduct of correctional officers acting in a grossly negligent manner in monitoring an arrestee). \r\n \r\nIn the instant case, Plyler contends that Â§15-78-60(12) is applicable to the actions of HCPC because the court issued a â€œCertificate of Appointmentâ€ to Burns.Â  Plyler misconstrues the probate courtâ€™s role in issuing the certificate and also erroneously stretches the intention of the statute.Â  The probate court issues a certificate of appointment only after a petition for appointment is filed. Â This petition commences an action where the probate court makes a judicial determination and orders appointment of a conservator.Â  The certificate of appointment is merely the method by which the court effects its order, and is not an issuance of a license or similar instrument.Â  Accordingly, this exception has no applicability to Plylerâ€™s case and should not be utilized as a means to interject a gross negligence standard into the analysis of the issues presented in this case.Â \r\n \r\nSection 15-78-60(25), regarding the custody and control of clients, is similarly inapplicable in this situation.Â  The unambiguous language of the statute clearly refers to the protection of the physical person.Â  Plyler makes no claim that the probate court breached any duty to protect her from physical harm.Â  Accordingly, Plyler does not qualify as a â€œclientâ€ pursuant to this provision and therefore may not use it to extend the gross negligence standard to the other provisions of the Tort Claims Act asserted by HCPC.\r\nTherefore, we find that the trial court did not err in declining to apply a gross negligence standard in its review of the exemptions to the waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We have re-framed the issues presented by Plyler to more concisely conform to the arguments presented in the appellate briefs.Â Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26336","title":"State v.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P. Turner, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tR. Davis Howser, of Howser, Newman, and Besley, LLC, ofÂ  Columbia, for Respondent.Â \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to disbarment pursuant to Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent requests the disbarment be made retroactive to the date of her interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Wilmeth, 368 S.C. 173, 628 S.E.2d 884 (2006).Â  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The disbarment shall not be made retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts set forth below are as reported by the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and are fully sufficient to support respondentâ€™s disbarment from the practice of law in this state.Â  We express no judgment about other pending matters not reflected herein.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent served as attorney for and, later, as personal representative of two related estates.Â  In connection therewith, the probate judge for Darlington County issued a February 3, 2006 order finding, in effect, that respondent failed to provide competent legal services to the personal representative of those estates, was not diligent in performing her professional services in connection with the estates, overcharged both estates for attorneyâ€™s fees and the personal representativeâ€™s statutory fees, and mishandled the estatesâ€™ tax returns, resulting in the imposition of unnecessary penalties and interest.Â  The probate judge further found that respondent should be required to repay the excessive fees and to reimburse the estates for the tax penalties and interest.Â  \r\n \r\nMore specifically, respondent drafted the wills for two individuals and named herself as alternate and/or substitute personal representative in each of the wills without complying with the provisions of Rule 1.8, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  After the death of the two individuals, respondent undertook to serve as attorney for each of the estates.Â  When vacancies became available for the position of personal representative, respondent applied for appointment and was appointed as alternate and/or substitute personal representative for both of the estates.Â  Respondent continued to prepare legal documents for the estates.Â  She did not obtain a court order relieving her as counsel for either estate.\r\nRespondent misappropriated $861,367.52 from either one or both of the estates and deposited these funds into an account of one or more entities owned, managed, and controlled by herself or some other bank account chosen by herself, but not in her trust account, and not in a bank account for either estate.Â  On February 17, 2006, the probate court held a hearing to determine the whereabouts of these funds.Â  At the hearing, the probate judge placed respondent under oath and three times asked her to report the location of the funds.Â  Each time, respondent refused to divulge the location of the funds.Â  Thereafter, the judge held respondent in contempt â€œfor removal of the monies from the estate account in question without court approval and failure of [respondent] to provide the court with any information on where the monies are now located.â€Â  The judge sentenced respondent to six months of confinement in the Darlington County Detention Center with a proviso that the contempt could be purged by payment in full to the estate(s).\r\nRespondent was incarcerated.Â  The following day, respondent caused the sum of $861,583.22 to be delivered to the probate court in the form of a check from Mutual Savings Bank, and the judge released respondent from confinement.Â  These funds were not obtained from respondentâ€™s trust account or from the estatesâ€™ bank accounts.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent borrowed $4,950,000 from four clients without complying with the requirements of Rule 1.8, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The money owed on these four obligations is now past due and owing.Â  Respondent admits that she abused the trust of these clients by borrowing money from them without complying with the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â \r\n \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent closed a real estate transaction and received approximately $160,000 to be disbursed in connection therewith.Â  Respondent failed to make disbursement of the funds as required by the closing documents and, instead, used all or a portion of the funds for her own purposes.Â  The sum of $160,000 had not been disbursed by respondent at the time she was placed on interim suspension and, at that time, her trust account had a balance of only $16,000.Â  The deed related to the transaction had not been signed or recorded in the public records at the time respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â \r\n \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent served as the closing attorney for a real estate transaction and received approximately $228,000 in funds to be held in trust until disbursed by respondent according to the agreement of the parties to the transaction.Â  Respondent failed to promptly satisfy the first and second mortgages of the sellers of the subject property or to promptly distribute the balance of the sellersâ€™ funds to the persons and entities entitled thereto.Â Â  Approximately six weeks after the closing, respondent paid off the second mortgage on the subject real property.Â  Respondent did not disburse the closing costs of the transaction until approximately three weeks after the closing.Â  As of the date of the execution of the Agreement for Discipline by Consent, respondent had failed to satisfy the first mortgage but had confessed judgment in the matter.Â \r\n \r\nOn the date on which she was placed on interim suspension, there was a balance of approximately $16,000 in respondentâ€™s trust account.Â  Since the first mortgage had not been paid off, the balance should have been at least $158,000.Â  Instead, the funds had been misappropriated by respondent and used for her own benefit or purpose.Â \r\n \r\nOn several occasions, parties to this transaction contacted respondent about unpaid items connected with the closing and, when so contacted, respondent gave inaccurate or, at least incomplete, information in an attempt to conceal the fact that she did not have the funds in her trust account from which to make the disbursements provided by the settlement documents.Â  In addition, respondent failed to maintain ledgers or disbursement schedules in connection with this transaction.Â \r\n \r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent served as the closing attorney in numerous real estate transactions.Â  She retained monies in these closings to pay the related premiums on the title insurance policies to the title insurance company.Â  The title insurance company discovered 28 missing policy jackets that had been transmitted to respondent but for which she could not account.Â  As a result, the title company revoked its agency agreement with respondent and required her to write a check for the known outstanding premiums due to the title insurance company.Â  Respondent issued a check for $4,100 made payable to the order of the title insurance company.Â  The check was dishonored upon presentment to the bank.Â  The premiums remain due and owing to the title insurance company.Â \r\n \r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent maintained funds in her trust account which belonged to her domestic employee.Â  On numerous occasions, the employee made withdrawals from and deposits into respondentâ€™s trust account.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent admits that it was improper to allow her domestic employee access to her trust account. Â In addition, respondent admits that she commingled client funds with non-client funds by maintaining funds which belonged to her employee in her trust account.Â  She further admits that, because of other shortages in her trust account, it is impossible to determine what part of the balance on hand in the trust account belongs to the employee and what part belongs to others who might have a claim against the balance, and that there is a distinct possibility that other persons and entities might have or claim to have an interest in the balance of funds in the trust account that would cause the employee to receive only a small pro-rata amount, if any, of the balance remaining in respondentâ€™s trust account.Â  Â Â Â \r\nMatter VII\r\nOver a period of time, respondent has repeatedly failed to comply with the money handling and recordkeeping requirements of Rule 1.15, RPC, and Rule 417, SCACR.Â  These failures include not making monthly reconciliations of her trust account and not keeping separate ledgers or records showing funds received and disbursed for each respective client.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by her misconduct, she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not charge or collect unreasonable fee); Rule 1.7 (lawyer shall not represent a client if representation involves current conflict of interest); Rule 1.8 (lawyer shall not knowingly acquire a pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless the client consents in writing); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold funds belonging to client or third party separate from the lawyerâ€™s own funds; lawyer shall promptly deliver funds to third parties); Rule 5.3 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that a non-lawyer employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  In addition, respondent admits she failed to comply with the recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR .\r\n \r\nRespondent further admits her misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute administration of justice, bring courts or legal profession into disrepute, or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate oath of office), and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate a court order).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  The disbarment shall not be made retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension. Â Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender her Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â \r\n \r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent and ODC shall agree to a restitution plan.Â  In the plan, respondent shall agree to pay restitution to all presently known and/or subsequently identified clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of her misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Moreover, respondent shall agree to reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection for any claims paid as a result of her misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  The restitution plan shall require respondent to begin paying restitution immediately. Â Respondent shall not be eligible to apply for reinstatement to the practice of law until and unless she demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Court by clear and convincing evidence that she has made full and appropriate restitution.Â \r\n \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26338","title":"In the Matter of Harold L.

Hamilton, of Chester, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Christopher Pittman was arrested and charged with double homicide in connection with the deaths of his paternal grandparents.Â  Pittman was twelve years old at the time of the incident. After a hearing, the family court waived jurisdiction allowing Pittman to be tried as an adult.Â  The jury convicted Pittman of both murders and the trial judge sentenced Pittman to two concurrent terms of thirty years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nIn November of 2001, Christopher Pittman (Appellant) shot and killed his paternal grandparents, Joe Frank and Joy Pittman, at close range with a .410 shotgun.Â  At the time of the incident, Appellant was twelve years old and had recently come from Florida, where he lived with his father, to live with his grandparents in Chester, South Carolina.Â \r\n \r\nShortly before moving to Chester with his grandparents, Appellantâ€™s relationship with his father became strained.Â  Specifically, Appellant had attempted to run away from home, and also had threatened to harm himself with a knife.Â  In response to this behavior, Appellantâ€™s father committed him to an inpatient facility.Â  While at the facility, Appellant began taking the antidepressant Paxil.Â  Soon after a short period of commitment, Appellantâ€™s father had him released from the facility and agreed to allow Appellant to live with his grandparents in Chester.\r\n \r\nUpon moving to Chester, Appellant enrolled in school and began to actively participate in church with his grandparents.Â  His grandmother also continued Appellantâ€™s treatment for depression by taking him to a local physician to refill his Paxil prescription.Â  The physician did not refill the Paxil prescription, but instead offered free samples and a prescription of Zoloft.[1]Â   \r\nOn the day of the murders, the assistant principal of Appellantâ€™s school called Appellantâ€™s grandparents to the school in response to an incident which occurred the previous day on the school bus.Â  During the incident in question, Appellant allegedly choked a second grade student.Â  After leaving the school, Appellant and his grandparents attended choir practice.Â  The church musician testified that she admonished Appellant for kicking her chair, at which time his grandfather took him outside to talk to him.Â  Upon their return, the musician noted that Appellant had an angry expression.\r\nAccording to Appellant, when they returned home, his grandparents locked him in his room and his grandfather warned him that he would paddle Appellant if he came out of the room.Â  Later that night, Appellant came out of his room and his grandfather paddled him.Â  After his grandparents went to bed, Appellant waited for ten minutes, loaded a shotgun, entered their bedroom, and shot his grandparents to death in their bed.Â  Appellant then lit several candles and positioned them so that the house would catch on fire after he left. Appellant collected some money, weapons, and his dog, took the keys to his grandparents SUV, and drove away.Â \r\n \r\nEarly the next morning, two hunters found Appellant wandering around in the woods with a shotgun.Â  Appellant told the hunters that he had been kidnapped by a black man who had shot his grandparents and set their home on fire.Â  Appellant further told the hunters that he was able to escape when the kidnapper got the SUV stuck in the woods.Â  He further stated that the kidnapper had shot at him before throwing the vehicleâ€™s keys and running into the woods.Â  Upon hearing this story, the hunters, who were also firemen with the Corinth Fire Department, took Appellant to the fire station where they alerted the police.\r\nA search ensued for the black man who allegedly committed the crimes as Appellant suggested.Â  During this time, Chester deputy Lucinda McKellar (McKellar) arrived to speak with Appellant.Â  Under the impression that Appellant was a victim and possible witness to the crimes, McKellar took an oral and written statement from Appellant.Â  In the statements, Appellant related the story that he had told the hunters.Â \r\n \r\nAs the search for the alleged kidnapper continued, the Chester police were also conducting an investigation of the crime scene.Â  At some point in the afternoon, McKellarâ€™s supervisor notified her that the information from the crime scene and the search of the vehicle indicated that Appellant was a possible suspect in the crimes.Â  At that time, McKellar took Appellant to the police station.Â \r\n \r\nWhen they arrived at the police station, McKellar took Appellant to a conference room and told him that they needed to have an â€œadult conversation.â€Â  Pittman sat down at the table and McKellar explained the Miranda rights.Â  At that time, Appellant gave the officers a third statement in which he confessed to the murders and detailed the events of the night.Â  McKellar wrote the statement and Appellant read and signed it.\r\nAfter his confession, the police arrested Appellant for double homicide and arson.Â  The prosecution filed a motion with the family court to waive its jurisdiction, which the family court granted.Â  After several pretrial motions, various continuances, and delays, Appellantâ€™s trial was held from January 31, 2005 to February 15, 2005.Â  The jury convicted Appellant on both counts of murder.Â  The trial judge sentenced Appellant to the shortest sentence possible under the mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines - two concurrent terms of thirty years imprisonment.Â \r\n \r\nAfter unsuccessfully arguing several post-trial motions for a new trial, Appellant filed this notice of appeal.Â  This Court certified the appeal for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and issued an order expediting the appeal.Â  Appellant raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tfailing to direct a verdict in favor of Appellant because the \r\n\t\t\tprosecution failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut the \r\n\t\t\tpresumption of incapacity?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWas Appellant deprived of his \r\n\t\t\tconstitutional right to a speedy trial?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tdenying Appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial based on two jurorsâ€™ \r\n\t\t\tpost-trial comments that they did not think Appellant was guilty?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tdenying Appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial based on juror \r\n\t\t\tmisconduct?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in \r\n\t\t\twaiving jurisdiction over Appellantâ€™s case?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVI.\r\n\t\t\tShould this Court overrule its \r\n\t\t\tprevious decision in State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000)?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDoes it violate the Eighth \r\n\t\t\tAmendment to the United States Constitution to sentence a \r\n\t\t\ttwelve-year-old to a thirty-year prison term without the possibility \r\n\t\t\tof parole?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tfailing to suppress Appellantâ€™s confession?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIX. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tfailing to charge the jury on the offenses of voluntary and \r\n\t\t\tinvoluntary manslaughter?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tX.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court properly \r\n\t\t\tcharge the jury regarding involuntary intoxication?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tXI.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\texcluding certain anecdotal information regarding the effects of \r\n\t\t\tZoloft?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Presumption of Incapacity\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for directed verdict because the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence during its case in chief to rebut the presumption of incapacity.Â  Specifically, Appellant argues that lay testimony is insufficient to rebut the presumption, and suggests that expert testimony is required.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tWhen a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal is made in a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  The accused is entitled to a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion of guilt. \r\n\tÂ The accused also is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to present evidence on a material element of the offense charged.Â  \r\n\tHowever, if the State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to prove the defendants[sic] guilt, or from which the defendants[sic] guilt can be fairly and logically deduced, the case must go to the jury. On appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the State.\r\n\r\nState v. Brown, 360 S.C. 581, 586-87, 602 S.E.2d 392, 395 (2004) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\r\nGenerally, a criminal defendant is presumed to have the requisite capacity to be held responsible for the commission of a crime.Â  State v. Smith, 298 S.C. 205, 208, 379 S.E.2d 287, 288 (1989) (stating that a criminal defendant is presumed sane).Â  However, â€œ[w]here a person is between seven and fourteen years of age, he is presumed not to have the mental capacity of committing a crime, but that is a rebuttable presumption, and it may be shown that he was mentally capable of committing a crime, although he was between the age of seven and fourteen years.â€Â  State v. Blanden, 177 S.C. 1, 21, 180 S.E. 681, 689-90 (1935) (citing the trial courtâ€™s jury charge on presumption of incapacity with approval).Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough this Court has not previously addressed whether expert testimony is required to rebut the presumption of incapacity regarding children under age fourteen, the Court has addressed similar issues relating to the capacity of adults.Â  In State v. Smith, this Court held that the State could use lay testimony to rebut a criminal defendantâ€™s insanity defense.Â  298 S.C. at 208, 379 S.E.2d at 288 (finding expert testimony unnecessary to show sanity where the State presents sufficient lay testimony from which the jury may infer sanity).Â  Additionally in State v. Poindexter, we found that the â€œjury was free to rely on circumstantial evidence to find [the defendant] sane even though expert testimony favored a finding that he was insane.â€ 314 S.C. 490, 494, 431 S.E.2d 254, 256 (1993).\r\nDuring its case in chief, the State presented several witnesses who testified about Appellantâ€™s behavior and demeanor the day after the murders.Â  Both of the hunters who encountered Appellant in the woods testified regarding the detail and clarity of Appellantâ€™s kidnapper story.Â  They also testified that although Appellant seemed a little scared because he was lost, Appellant was quiet and calm, and they could understand everything that he said to them.Â \r\n \r\nThe State also presented the testimony of several investigators.Â  Darryl Duncan, the initial law enforcement officer to whom Appellant spoke, testified that Appellant relayed the story about the kidnapper to him and that Appellant seemed calm and was very understandable.Â  Additionally, Lucinda McKellar, the investigator who spent the most time with Appellant, testified that Appellant told her the kidnapper story and gave her a very detailed statement about the events that occurred the previous day.Â  During McKellarâ€™s trial testimony, the State also admitted Appellantâ€™s confession.Â  The confession describes the murders and the arson executed to cover up the murders.Â \r\n \r\nThe State did not present any expert testimony as to Appellantâ€™s capacity until its case in reply.Â  During reply, the State offered the testimony of Dr. Pamela Crawford, a court appointed examiner.Â  Dr. Crawford testified that, in her opinion, Appellant was competent and capable of understanding the difference between right and wrong.Â  She further testified that Appellant admitted that what he did was wrong, but maintained that his grandparents deserved it.Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nThe State also presented the testimony of Dr. Julian Sharman, a Department of Juvenile Justice psychiatrist.Â  Dr. Sharman testified that Appellant admitted he sat in his room and thought of a plan to get rid of his grandfather.Â Â Â  Dr. Sharman also testified that Appellant showed no remorse for his actions, and although upset about the murders, he felt his grandparents â€œasked for it.â€\r\nThrough the testimony presented in its case in chief, the State presented evidence which demonstrated that Appellant was able to think of a story to cover up his involvement in the crime and relate the story, with little deviation, to several different people. The State also presented evidence to show that Appellant was calm and articulate as he repeatedly retold the story. This testimony regarding the cover-up story alone was sufficient to at least create a reasonable inference that Appellant knew right from wrong and that he had done something wrong.Â \r\n \r\nAlthough no expert testimony was presented in the prosecutionâ€™s case in chief, we hold that the lay testimony of the hunters and investigators was sufficient to at least present a question for the jury as to Appellantâ€™s capacity.Â  Given that the Stateâ€™s case in chief contained such voluminous testimony about Appellantâ€™s demeanor and behavior, the trial judge correctly made the finding that there was enough evidence to rebut the presumption of incapacity and send the case to the jury.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, if we consider the evidence presented in the Stateâ€™s reply case, the record contains sufficient expert testimony regarding Appellantâ€™s capacity to warrant a denial of a directed verdict on this ground.Â  Both experts examined Appellant shortly after he was arrested for the murders and were able to observe his behavior.Â  Both experts testified that Appellant understood that his actions were wrong, but showed no remorse for his actions because he felt justified.Â  We find this evidence more than adequate to rebut the presumption of incapacity and allow the jury to determine whether Appellant had the capacity to be held accountable for the murders of his grandparents.Â \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Appellantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  The State is not required to present expert testimony to rebut the presumption of incapacity.Â \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp; Right to a Speedy Trial\r\nAppellant contends that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nA criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to a speedy trial.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.Â  This right â€œis designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.â€ United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 8 (1982).Â  In determining whether a defendant has been deprived of the right to a speedy trial, the court must consider four factors:Â  1) length of the delay; 2) reason for the delay; 3) the defendantâ€™s assertion of the right; and 4) prejudice to the defendant.Â  Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972).Â Â  Accordingly, the determination that a defendant has been deprived of this right is not based on the passage of a specific period of time, but instead is analyzed in terms of the circumstances of each case, balancing the conduct of the prosecution and the defense.Â  Id; State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 71, 480 S.E.2d 64, 68 (1997).Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe inquiry into the length of the delay functions as a trigger mechanism for the analysis of the three other factors.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 530.Â  Although there is no fixed time in which a defendant must be tried, the right to a speedy trial may be violated where the delay is arbitrary or unreasonable. Â State v. Waites, 270 S.C. 104, 108, 240 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1978).Â Â  Additionally, a delay may be so lengthy as to require a finding of presumptive prejudice, and thus trigger the analysis of the other factors.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nOnce the defendant has established that the delay is sufficient to warrant analysis of the other factors, the court must consider the reason for the delay.Â  The ultimate responsibility for the trial of a criminal defendant rests with the State.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531.Â  Therefore, the court should weigh heavily against the State any intentional delays to impede the defense.Â  Id.Â  Where the reason for the delay is more neutral, the court should weigh it less heavily against the State.Â  Id.Â  A valid reason presented by the State may justify an appropriate delay.Â  Id.Â  However, the Court must also consider and weigh the defendantâ€™s contribution to the delay in determining whether the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment rights have been violated.Â  Waites, 270 S.C. at 108, 240 S.E.2d at 653 (holding defendantâ€™s contribution to the delay of the trial militated against a finding of a violation of the right to a speedy trial).\r\nNext, the Court must consider the actions of the defendant in asserting the right to a speedy trial.Â Â  â€œThe defendantâ€™s assertion of his speedy trial right . . . is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.â€Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531.Â Â  However, the defendantâ€™s failure to assert the right, although not conclusive, makes it more difficult to show that the right was violated.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nFinally, the Court must determine whether the defendant has suffered any prejudice as a result of the delay.Â  The United States Supreme Court has said that the most serious interest to be protected by the guarantee to a speedy trial is the possibility of impairment of the defense.Â  â€œ[C]onsideration of prejudice is not limited to the specifically demonstrable . . . and affirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim.â€ Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 654 (1992).Â Â  In fact, an unduly excessive delay can be presumptively prejudicial.Â  Id. at 655.Â  However, regardless of whether the defense is able to show particularized prejudice or the delay warrants a finding of presumptive prejudice, prejudice remains only one of the four factors to be considered in a speedy trial analysis.Â  Id. at 656.\r\nAppellant was arrested and charged in November of 2001, and Appellantâ€™s trial began on January 31, 2005.Â  In the three years between Appellantâ€™s arrest and trial, several pre-trial matters arose.Â  The original defense counsel requested that Appellant be evaluated for competency in December of 2001.Â  The month after the State served its intent to transfer Appellantâ€™s trial to General Sessions, defense counsel filed a motion for a continuance because the competency evaluations had not been completed, counsel had not seen all discovery, and counsel had not retained an independent expert.Â  The competency evaluation was completed in February of 2002.Â \r\n \r\nIn February of 2003, the family court judge contacted the parties because the pre-waiver hearing process was taking too long.Â  Both the State and the defense indicated that neither the DJJ evaluation nor the defenseâ€™s independent expert evaluation were complete and more time was needed.Â  After the completion of the DJJ evaluation, the family court held the waiver hearing, and in June of 2003 the court issued an order waiving jurisdiction.Â \r\n \r\nIn January and February of 2004, the defense served notices of their intention to pursue an insanity defense and an involuntary intoxication defense. The defense made another motion for a continuance in April of 2004, and subsequently filed a discovery request for the pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, to produce documents in May of 2004.Â  After the hearing on the discovery motion, the trial judge recused himself because his wife owned Pfizer stock.Â  This Court appointed a new trial judge in June of 2004.\r\nIn September of 2004, the defense first asserted that Appellant had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment rights.Â  The trial court heard pretrial motions in December of 2004.Â Â  Appellantâ€™s trial began on January 31, 2005.\r\nIn his brief, Appellant suggests that the delay of his trial was so lengthy that it not only meets the requisite finding of delay, but also that the delay is presumptively prejudicial.Â Â  We find the delay of three years and two months between Appellantâ€™s arrest and trial is sufficient to trigger an analysis of the other factors. Â See Waites, 270 S.C. at 108, 240 S.E.2d at 653 (finding a delay of two years and four months sufficient to trigger a balancing of the other factors).Â  However, we decline to find the delay of Appellantâ€™s trial presumptively prejudicial.Â  See State v. Foster, 260 S.C. 511, 515, 197 S.E.2d 280, 281 (1973) (finding a delay of more than five years was sufficient to require analysis of the other factors without finding presumptive prejudice).Â Â  \r\n \r\nAs to the reasons for the delay, Appellant argues that the State has â€œoffered no plausible explanation whatsoeverâ€ for the delay.Â  Appellant further argues that the Stateâ€™s responsibility for ensuring a speedy trial is somehow heightened by the parens patriae jurisdiction of the family court.Â  This argument is misleading in light of the record before the Court.Â  While the ultimate responsibility for timely completion of the trial rests with the State, the defenseâ€™s contributions to the delay cannot be ignored.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant was represented by counsel at all times during the trial process.Â  In fact, Appellant contributed to the delay, at least to some degree, by requesting independent competency evaluations and continuances.Â  Furthermore, Appellant contributed to the delay because of the necessary preparation involved in the complex defenses asserted at trial.\r\nThe record does not reflect any intentional or malicious delays by the prosecution, nor does the record reflect any negligent prosecutorial behavior in connection with this case.Â  Additionally, the delays attributable to the defense were also reasonable in light of the circumstances of this case.Â  Although it took a long time for the case to come to trial, any delay was the result of the complexities of this case.Â  The justifications for the delay offered by both parties in this case weigh in favor of a finding that Appellant was not deprived of his right to a speedy trial.\r\nAs to the third factor in the analysis, Appellant strongly encourages this Court to consider the family courtâ€™s parens patriae status in weighing how and when he asserted his right to a speedy trial.Â  Recognizing the role of the family court, we also note that Appellant was continuously represented by counsel, yet did not assert his rights until September of 2004.Â  Up to that point, the defense was, at least to some degree, still preparing for the case.Â  Although we find that Appellant did not waive his right to a speedy trial simply by not asserting it promptly, we also find that the responsibility for raising his speedy trial concerns do not rest solely with the family court because of its parens patriae status, especially where Appellant was continuously represented by counsel. \r\n \r\nFinally, Appellant fails to meet the requirement of prejudice.Â  Appellant relies primarily on the fact that he grew from â€œa 5â€™2â€™â€™ boy to a 6â€™1â€™â€™ young manâ€ to make a showing of actual prejudice, analogizing the situation to the use of shackles on a defendant in a death penalty case.Â  Appellant mischaracterizes any prejudice caused by his appearance.Â  Recognizing that Appellantâ€™s appearance may have presented an obstacle for the defense, the trial court allowed the defense to display a full size cutout of Appellant depicting his actual appearance at the time of the murders.Â  Defendants often experience changes in their appearance between arrest and trial.Â  Sometimes those appearance differences are the result of things beyond the defendantâ€™s control, while other times defendants purposefully change their appearance.Â  Given the quantity of evidence presented in this case, we find that Appellant did not suffer any prejudicial effect as a result of his appearance.\r\nAdditionally, Appellant received some benefits as a result of the delay.Â  Appellant was able to fully develop his Zoloft defense, which would not have been possible had his trial occurred soon after his arrest.Â  Appellant was also able to secure several witnesses to attest to his behavioral improvement while at DJJ.Â  Accordingly, we find that Appellant was not prejudiced by the delay simply because his appearance changed during the time between his arrest and trial.\r\nAlthough Appellantâ€™s trial delay was very lengthy, we find the trial court did not err in finding no violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Unanimous Verdict\r\nAppellant argues that the verdict returned by the jury was not unanimous based on the post-trial comments of two jurors, and therefore the verdict violates his rights to due process and trial by jury.Â  Specifically, Appellant argues that the verdict returned by the jury was not the juryâ€™s true verdict because the two jurors voted guilty as a result of a misunderstanding of the law.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court has broad discretion in assessing allegations of juror misconduct.Â  State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 142, 502 S.E.2d 99, 104 (1998).Â  Â If the juror misconduct does not affect the impartiality of the jury, it is not the type of misconduct which will affect the verdict.Â  Id.Â  The decision to grant or deny a motion based on juror misconduct is within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion which amounts to an error of law.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nGenerally, juror testimony is not allowed regarding the deliberations of the jury or internal influences.Â  State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. 85, 88, 463 S.E.2d 314, 316 (1995).Â  â€œ[C]ourts should not intrude into the privacy of the jury room to scrutinize how jurors reached their verdict.â€Â  Id. Â However, where the allegation of improper internal influence potentially affects fundamental fairness, the court may accept juror testimony to ensure due process.Â  State v. Galbreath, 359 S.C. 398, 406, 597 S.E.2d 845, 849 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIn Galbreath, the court of appeals held that a misunderstanding of the law does not warrant a new trial absent a denial of fundamental fairness.Â  Id.Â  Galbreath alleged that his due process rights were violated because two jurors testified they found the defendant guilty of ABHAN based on another jurorâ€™s statement that the defendant would not serve jail time if convicted.Â  Id.Â  The court found that the misinformation regarding sentencing did not cause a violation of due process and did not warrant a new trial.Â Â  Id. at 407, 597 S.E.2d at 849.\r\nAfter the conclusion of Appellantâ€™s trial, the defense notified the trial court of the alleged juror misconduct.Â  The defense alleged that one of the jurors had inappropriate conversations with both his wife and a bartender during the jury deliberations.Â  As a result of this allegation, the trial court conducted a hearing.Â  During the hearing, additional information was elicited from the jurors.Â  Specifically, two jurors stated that they did not think the Appellant was guilty and that they only voted guilty as a result of information garnered from other jurors.Â  Both jurors testified that they felt pressured to vote guilty.Â  One juror stated that she voted guilty because another juror told her that the majority rules, and therefore everyone had to vote together to return a unanimous verdictÂ Â  The other stated that she voted guilty because the other jurors told her that she had to vote one way or the other.Â \r\n \r\nCiting Rule 606(b), SCRE, the trial court found that the allegations concerned internal influences and that juror testimony concerning such influence was incompetent to impeach the verdict.Â  The trial court also found that any of the offered misunderstandings of the law did not implicate due process or fundamental fairness.Â \r\n \r\nWe find that these misunderstandings of the law regarding the unanimity of the verdict were insufficient to warrant a new trial.Â  The trial court was correct in its order that such instances of internal influence do not implicate fundamental fairness.Â  Although Appellant cites several cases concerning internal influence where courts have held that fundamental fairness required the granting of a new trial, the instant case does not present similar circumstances.Â  Most of the cases upon which Appellant relies contain an internal influence of a coercive nature (i.e. racial prejudice, gender bias).Â Â Â  In contrast, while the jurors in this case expressed that they felt coerced into voting guilty, no testimony was presented to actually show coercive behavior.Â  As other courts have held, a juryâ€™s misapprehension of the law is not enough to impeach a verdict.Â  See Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific R.R. v. Speth, 404 F.2d 291, 295 (8th Cir.1968). \r\n \r\nAdditionally, even if the jurors mistakenly believed the incorrect information from another juror, they were given ample opportunity to voice those concerns before the trial court accepted the verdict.Â  Before the deliberations, the trial court explicitly charged that a unanimous verdict was not the same as a majority verdict.Â  Moreover, upon receiving the jury verdict, the foreman was asked if the verdict was actually what the jury decided.Â  The trial court also polled each juror, confirming that each agreed with the verdict.Â  See State v. Green, 351 S.C. 184, 196, 569 S.E.2d 318, 324 (2002) (noting that the trial court conducts a poll of the jury for the specific purpose of ensuring a unanimous verdict).Â  The jurorsâ€™ post-verdict testimonies are representative of many jury deliberations where individuals are persuaded, for whatever reason, to change their vote.Â  As long as the reason prompting the change was not coercive or oppressive, the court should not disturb the finality of the verdict.Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial based on the two jurorsâ€™ post-verdict testimonies.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Juror MisconductÂ Â Â  \r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct.Â  Appellant alleges that one of the jurors had inappropriate conversations with the jurorâ€™s wife and a bartender, and that these communications prejudiced the verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, juror testimony may not be the basis for impeaching a jury verdict.Â  Hunter, 320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316.Â  However, this rule is relaxed where there are allegations of external influence.Â  Id.Â  Jury misconduct that does not affect the juryâ€™s impartiality will not undermine the verdict.Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 S.E.2d 626, 628 (2000).\r\nThe trial court may exercise broad discretion in assessing the prejudicial effect of an allegation of juror misconduct due to an external influence.Â  Id.Â  The trial court should consider three factors when making this determination:Â  (1) the number of jurors exposed, (2) the weight of the evidence properly before the jury, and (3) the likelihood that curative measures were effective in reducing the prejudice.Â  Id. Â The trial courtâ€™s finding will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.\r\nAppellant alleges that there are two instances of juror misconduct involving external sources.Â  First, Appellant alleges that one of the jurors (Juror A) inappropriately discussed the case with his wife.Â  Additionally, Appellant alleges that Juror A participated in an inappropriate conversation with a bartender.Â \r\n \r\nThe trial court held a hearing regarding these allegations.Â  During the hearing, Juror A admitted that his wife shared her point of view on the case with him, but testified that he did not express his views to her.Â Â  Juror A also admitted that he had mentioned to a bartender that he was on the jury, but alleges that was the extent of the conversation.Â \r\n \r\nSeveral jurors testified that Juror A told them his wife did not agree with him.Â  Although one juror said that she assumed his wife felt a not guilty verdict was appropriate, none of the jurors testified that he told them his wifeâ€™s point of view.Â Â  Additionally, none of the jurors testified that Juror A shared his views with his wife.Â \r\n \r\nDuring the bartenderâ€™s testimony at the hearing, he testified that Juror A told him he was on the jury.Â  The bartender also said that Juror A told him that he thought Appellant was guilty.Â  Although there is some debate about when the conversation took place, both Juror A and the reporter who ignited the inquiry into jury misconduct stated that the conversation took place on the Monday night after deliberations had begun.Â  The bartender, however, was less sure and unable to definitively say whether the conversation happened on Sunday or Monday.Â Â Â \r\n \r\nAfter the hearing, the trial court found that, although juror misconduct occurred, Appellant could not make the required showing of prejudice.Â  Therefore, the trial court upheld the verdict.\r\nFirst, we find the trial court correctly found that Appellant experienced no prejudicial effect from any comments from Juror Aâ€™s wife.Â  The record reflects that approximately four jurors, including Juror A, were exposed to knowledge of the wifeâ€™s comment.Â  Only one, Juror A, actually knew what the wife said.Â  There is no evidence that the comment prejudicially affected Juror Aâ€™s verdict, even if Juror Aâ€™s wife did say she thought Appellant was not guilty.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nIn this case, the more critical inquiry is whether Juror A engaged in premature deliberations.Â  Premature deliberations may affect the fundamental fairness of a trial.Â  State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 312, 509 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1999).\r\n\r\n\t[Therefore], a jury should not begin discussing a case, nor deciding the issues, until all of the evidence, the argument of counsel, and the charge of the law is completed.Â  . . .Â  The human mind is constituted such that when a juror declares himself, touching any controversy, he is apt to stand by his utterances to the other jurors in defiance of evidence. A fair trial is more likely if each juror keeps his own counsel until the appropriate time for deliberation.\r\n\r\nId. at 311, 509 S.E.2d at 813.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nJuror A clearly remembers the conversation with the bartender as occurring on the Monday night that jury deliberation began.Â  The reporterâ€™s testimony supports Juror Aâ€™s claim.Â  The only person who testified differently was the bartender who was completely unsure of the day the conversation happened, but confidently testified that the conversation happened two days prior to the end of the trial.Â  The trial ended on a Wednesday.Â  Therefore, the record supports the trial judgeâ€™s finding that the conversation, although inappropriate, did not occur prior to the beginning of deliberations.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in finding that Appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the conversation.\r\nFor these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct.\r\n \r\nV.&nbsp; Family Court Waiver of Jurisdiction\r\nAppellant argues that the family court erred in waiving jurisdiction to the court of general sessions because an analysis of the Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541 (1966), factors does not justify waiver in Appellantâ€™s case.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court has exclusive jurisdiction over children[2] who are accused of criminal activity.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-400(A)(1)(d) (2003).Â  However, jurisdiction over a criminal matter may be transferred to the court of general sessions as provided under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605 (Supp. 2005) (transfer statute).Â  Subsection (6) of the transfer statute provides:\r\n\r\n\tWithin thirty days after the filing of a petition in the family court alleging the child has committed the offense of murder or criminal sexual conduct, the person executing the petition may request in writing that the case be transferred to the court of general sessions with a view to proceeding against the child as a criminal rather than as a child coming within the purview of this article. The judge of the family court is authorized to determine this request. If the request is denied, the Appellant may appeal within five days to the circuit court. Upon the hearing of the appeal, the judge of the circuit court is vested with the discretion of exercising and asserting the jurisdiction of the court of general sessions or of relinquishing jurisdiction to the family court. If the circuit judge elects to exercise the jurisdiction of the general sessions court for trial of the case, he shall issue an order to that effect, and then the family court has no further jurisdiction in the matter.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605(6).\r\nUpon a motion to transfer jurisdiction, the family court must determine if it is in the best interest of both the child and the community before granting the transfer request.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 64, 502 S.E.2d 63, 70 (1998).Â Â  The family court must consider eight factors, as approved by the United States Supreme Court in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541 (1966), in making this determination.Â  The factors are:\r\n\r\n\t(1) The seriousness of the alleged offense. \r\n\t\r\n\t(2) Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful manner.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t(3) Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons especially if personal injury resulted.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t(4) The prosecutive merit of the complaint. \r\n\t\r\n\t(5) The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense in one court. \r\n\t\r\n\t(6) The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined by consideration of his home, environmental situation, emotional attitude and pattern of living.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t(7) The record and previous history of the juvenile, including previous contacts with law enforcement agencies, juvenile courts and other jurisdictions, prior periods of probation, or prior commitments to juvenile institutions.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t(8) The prospects for adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is found to have committed the alleged offense) by the use of procedures, services and facilities currently available. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId.\r\nThe family court must provide a sufficient statement of the reasons for the transfer in its order.Â  State v. Avery, 333 S.C. 284, 293, 509 S.E.2d 476, 481 (1998).Â Â  â€œThe order should be sufficient to demonstrate that the statutory requirement of full investigation has been met and that the question has received full and careful consideration by the family court.â€Â  Id.Â  The decision to transfer jurisdiction lies within the discretion of the family court.Â  Id. at 292, 509 S.E.2d at 481.Â  The appellate court will affirm the family courtâ€™s decision absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.\r\nDuring the waiver hearing, the family court heard testimony regarding the murders.Â  Further, the court heard testimony regarding Appellantâ€™s life and intelligence.Â  The court also received testimony about Appellantâ€™s behavior at the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) as related to the potentially rehabilitative benefits Appellant could receive from DJJ programs.Â  After considering this testimony, the family court found that it was appropriate to waive jurisdiction of Appellantâ€™s case.Â \r\n \r\nWe find that the family court properly granted the Stateâ€™s request to waive its jurisdiction and allow Appellant to be tried as an adult.Â  Although the family courtâ€™s order is not extremely detailed, the order sufficiently demonstrates that a full investigation occurred.Â  Additionally, the record supports the family courtâ€™s decision.Â \r\n \r\nFurther, Appellantâ€™s argument that the court erred in finding that he would not benefit from the rehabilitation program at DJJ is not convincing.Â  Because we review the lower courtâ€™s decision only for anÂ  abuse of discretion, this Court would have to find the family courtâ€™s order wholly unsupported by the record in this regard to find error.Â  Instead, we find that this record contains a great deal of evidence supporting the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  Looking at events occurring both before the waiver hearing and after, while there is evidence in the pre-trial motions hearings which suggests that Appellant was cooperative and capable of rehabilitation, the record also reflects that Appellant engaged in escape plans, made shanks, and caused other disruptions while in the custody of DJJ.\r\nAccordingly, regardless of whether the Court considers just the facts in existence at the time of the waiver hearing or the additional facts which occurred after the waiver hearing, we find that sufficient evidence exists to support the satisfaction of the eight Kent factors.Â  Therefore, the family court did not err in waiving its jurisdiction to the circuit court.Â  \r\n \r\nVI.&nbsp; Corey D.\r\nAppellant asks this Court to overrule its decision in State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000), and find that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605(6) only allows the family court to waive jurisdiction over a juvenile if the juvenile is over the age of fourteen.Â Â  Appellant offers three reasons why this Court should overrule its decision in Corey D.: 1) the Court misinterpreted the legislative intent of the statute; 2) recent scientific data suggests twelve-year-olds lack the capacity to be subject to the statute; and 3) the Court may avoid any conflict between the statute and the Constitution. We decline to overrule Corey D.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (citations omitted).Â  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the maxim that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used. McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â  A statuteâ€™s language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  Id. Whenever possible, legislative intent should be found in the plain language of the statute itself.Â  Whitner v. State, 328 S.C 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997).Â Â  â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges, 341 S.C. at 85, 533 S.E.2d at 581.Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn Corey D., this Court held that Â§ 20-7-7605(6) permitted the family court to waive jurisdiction over a murder charge against a twelve-year-old to the court of general sessions.Â  Id.Â  Applying the rules of statutory construction in conjunction with prior case law, the Court found â€œsection 20-7-7605(6) authorizes transfer on the basis of the offense (murder) without regard to age, while other subsections of 20-7-7605 authorize transfer on the basis of age and the classification of the offense.â€ Â Id. at 113, 529 S.E.2d at 23 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\r\nAppellant argues that subsection (6)â€™s reference to â€œthe childâ€ as opposed to â€œa childâ€ indicates the legislatureâ€™s intention to confine the definition of â€œchildâ€ to the preceding subsection and not the definition of â€œchildâ€ as provided in the definition section of the Childrenâ€™s Code.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-6605(1).Â  Assuming the Legislature intended any meaning to be attributed to the use of the article â€œthe,â€ we believe it would refer to the language in the beginning of the statute - â€œjurisdiction over a case involving a child must be transferred or retained as followsâ€ - and not subsection (5) as Appellant suggests.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605.Â  The use of â€œchildâ€ in the beginning of the statute clearly refers to the definition contained in Â§ 20-7-6605 of the Childrenâ€™s Code, which defines â€œchildâ€ as a person less than seventeen years of age. \r\n \r\nAppellantâ€™s second argument regarding scientific data is not relevant to this Courtâ€™s interpretation of the statute.Â  The rules of statutory construction do not allow the Court to determine legislative intent based on scientific data.Â \r\n \r\nFinally, Appellant urges this Court to overrule Corey D. to avoid conflict with constitutional issues.[3]Â  This Court has held that where a statute is susceptible to more than one construction, the court should interpret the statute so as to avoid constitutional questions,Â  Brown v. County of Horry, 308 S.C. 180, 183, 417 S.E.2d 565, 567 (1992).Â Â  However, Â§ 20-7-7605(6) has only one construction as analyzed by this Court in Corey D.Â  Because we find that the statute has only one meaning, we cannot apply an alternate interpretation.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, we decline to overrule our decision in Corey D.\r\nVII.&nbsp; Eighth Amendment Claim\r\nAppellant argues that it violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution to sentence a twelve-year-old to a thirty-year prison term without the possibility of parole.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, â€œExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.â€Â  As this Court has recognized, what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, and thus, what violates the Eighth Amendment, is determined by â€œevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.â€Â  State v. Standard, 351 S.C. 199, 204, 569 S.E.2d 325, 328 (2002).[4]Â  \r\n \r\nThe United States Supreme Court has instructed that â€œthe â€˜clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the countryâ€™s legislatures.â€™â€Â  Atkins, 536 U.S. at 313 (quoting Penry v. Lynaugh, 493 U.S. 302, 331 (1989)).Â  The court has additionally stated that the Constitution requires the courtâ€™s own judgment to be brought to bear on the issue by â€œasking whether there is reason to disagree with the judgment reached by the citizenry and its legislators.â€Â  Id. at 313.\r\nAppellant presents several arguments to support his position.Â  First, Appellant argues that the portion of the brain that gives one the cognitive capacity to satisfactorily perform acts such as forming malice and waiving constitutional rights is underdeveloped in a twelve-year-old.Â  Thus, Appellant argues that he should be given a lesser sentence than if he were an adult.\r\nThis argument is unconvincing given the nature of the criminal acts of which Appellant was convicted.Â  Based on the evidence in the record, Appellant planned a double murder, executed an escape plan, and concocted a false story of the previous eveningâ€™s events.Â  Appellantâ€™s story was so detailed that it led law enforcement on an extensive rouse for most of the morning following his discovery.Â  The specific factual evidence in this case stands in stark contrast to the general nature of the scientific evidence submitted by Appellant.\r\nIn Standard, this Court stated â€œ[b]ased upon sentences imposed in other cases, we find lengthy sentences or sentences of life without parole imposed upon juveniles do not violate contemporary standards of decency so as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.â€Â  351 S.C. at 205, 569 S.E.2d at 329.Â  Although Appellant argues that he is the second youngest person in American history to be prosecuted in an adult court, that argument is not instructive for several reasons.Â  \r\n \r\nPrimarily, the argument does not address the Eighth Amendmentâ€™s concern, which is punishment; not forum of trial.Â  Second, we note that other courts have sentenced juveniles convicted of similarly violent crimes to lengthy sentences.Â  See State v. Ira, 43 P.3d 359, 361 (N.M. Ct. App. 2002) (sentence of ninety-nine and one half years imposed where defendant, at ages fourteen to fifteen, committed ten counts of criminal sexual assault against his step-sister);Â  Hawkins v. Hargett, 200 F.3d 1279, 1285 (10th Cir. 1999) (sentences totaling one hundred years (with possibility of parole) for a thirteen-year-old defendant convicted of burglary, forcible sodomy, rape, and robbery with a dangerous weapon); State v. Green, 502 S.E.2d 819, 828-33 (N.C. 1998) (mandatory life sentence imposed on thirteen-year-old convicted of a first-degree sexual offense);Â  Avery, 333 S.C. at 287, 509 S.E.2d at 478 (fourteen-year-old convicted of murder, armed robbery, and possession of a weapon while in commission of a violent crime given concurrent prison sentences of life, twenty-five years, and five years.); Harris v. Wright, 93 F.3d 581, 584 (9th Cir. 1996) (fifteen-year-old defendant sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for murder); State v. Sanders, 281 S.C. 53, 55, 314 S.E.2d 319, 320 (1984) (thirteen-year-old who pled guilty to two counts of voluntary manslaughter received two consecutive thirty-year prison sentences).[5]Â  Given this authority, we do not believe that evolving standards of decency in our society dictate that it is cruel and unusual to sentence a twelve-year-old convicted of double murder to a thirty-year prison term.\r\nFinally, Appellant overlooks the â€œproportionalityâ€ bedrock of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, which is equally important a principle as â€œevolving standards of decency.â€Â  This case involved a brutal double murder.Â  As the United States Supreme Court stated in Atkins: â€œit is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.â€Â  536 U.S. at 311 (quoting Weems, 317 U.S. at 367).Â  To paraphrase what the Tenth Circuit stated in Hawkins, â€œ[a]lthough [Appellantâ€™s] culpability may be diminished somewhat due to his age at the time of the crimes, it is arguably more than counterbalanced by the harm [Appellant] caused to his victim[s].â€Â  200 F.3d at 1284.\r\nâ€œTo establish that evolving standards of decency preclude his punishment, [Appellant] bears the â€˜heavy burden,â€™ of showing that our culture and laws emphatically and well nigh universally reject it.â€Â  Harris, 93 F.3d at 583 (citing Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361, 373 (1989)).Â  Appellant has not made such a showing.Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, we hold that Appellantâ€™s sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\r\nVIII.&nbsp; Admissibility of Appellantâ€™s Confession\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in refusing to suppress his confession.Â  We disagree.\r\nA criminal defendant is deprived of due process if his conviction is founded, in whole or in part, upon an involuntary confession.Â  Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 377 (1964).Â  This principle is best justified when viewed as part and parcel of â€œfundamental notions of fairness and justice in the determination of guilt or innocence which lie embedded in the feelings of the American people and are enshrined in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.â€Â  Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 607 (1948) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).[6]Â   \r\nIn determining whether a confession was given â€œvoluntarily,â€ this Court must consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendantâ€™s giving the confession.Â  Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 226 (1973).Â  As the United States Supreme Court has instructed, the totality of the circumstances includes â€œthe youth of the accused, his lack of education or his low intelligence, the lack of any advice to the accused of his constitutional rights, the length of detention, the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning, and the use of physical punishment such as the deprivation of food or sleep.â€Â  Id. (internal citations omitted).Â  Furthermore, no one factor is determinative, but each case requires careful scrutiny of all the surrounding circumstances.Â  Id.\r\nIn Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, and again in Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U.S. 49 (1962), the United States Supreme Court reversed juvenilesâ€™ convictions on the grounds that the confessions were involuntarily gathered.Â  Though the court addressed the scrutiny applied to juvenilesâ€™ confessions with quite broad language in each opinion,[7] it is firmly established that â€œa minor has the capacity to make a voluntary confession . . . without the presence or consent of counsel or other responsible adult, and the admissibility of such a confession depends not on his age alone but on a combination of that factor with such other circumstances as his intelligence, education, experience, and ability to comprehend the meaning and effect of his statement.â€Â  Jenkins v. State, 265 S.C. 295, 300, 217 S.E.2d 719, 722 (1975); see also Vance, 692 F.2d at 980 (quoting Williams v. Peyton, 404 F.2d 528, 530 (4th Cir. 1968) (â€œYouth by itself is not a ground for holding a confession inadmissible.â€); Miller v. Maryland, 577 F.2d 1158, 1159 (4th Cir. 1978); and United States v. Miller, 453 F.2d 634, 636 (4th Cir. 1972).\r\nWhen the hunters took Appellant to the fire department, the Corinth Police were the first to respond and begin a search for the kidnapper.Â  Around 11 a.m., Lucinda McKellar, an investigator with the Chester County Sheriffâ€™s Department, arrived at the fire department.Â  She had previous experience as a law enforcement victimâ€™s advocate.Â  While at the fire department, McKellar took two statements from Appellant.Â  The first statement was an oral recitation of the kidnapper story Appellant had earlier told the hunters.Â  The second statement was a written version of the same story.Â  Both of these statements were non-custodial because, at the time these statements were taken, Appellant was considered a victim and witness to the crime, not a suspect.Â \r\n \r\nMcKellar remained with Appellant after she took the statements, essentially acting as a babysitter. They had lunch together and played â€œgo fish.â€Â  Appellant also took several naps during the day.Â  Occasionally, Appellant would initiate a conversation with McKellar.Â  In one of the conversations, Appellant voluntarily recited a Bible verse about â€œburning in the fires of Hell.â€\r\nLater in the afternoon, McKellar received instructions from her superior to take Appellant to the sheriffâ€™s department because the investigations indicated that Appellant was a suspect and not a victim.Â Â  They arrived at the sheriffâ€™s department about 3 p.m., where McKellar took Appellant to a conference room.\r\nAt this point, McKellar told Appellant that they needed to have an â€œadult conversationâ€ and Appellant sat down at the table as McKellar began explaining Appellantâ€™s Miranda rights.Â  In the middle of McKellarâ€™s explanation of these rights, another officer, Detective Scott Williams (Williams), walked into the room.Â  McKellar then re-explained Appellantâ€™s Miranda rights to him while in Williamsâ€™ presence.Â  Williams then told Appellant that things were not adding up.Â  McKellar asked Appellant about the Bible verse he mentioned earlier, however, Appellant did not respond.Â  Williams next asked Appellant what his grandparents would think about him not being truthful.Â  At that point, Appellant gave the officers a third statement in which he confessed to the murders and detailed the events of the night.Â  McKellar wrote the statement and Appellant read and signed it.\r\nAfter a Jackson v. Denno hearing, the trial court found that Appellant made a valid waiver of his rights and that the statement was voluntarily given to the investigators.Â  The court determined that Appellant was not coerced, under duress, or influence.Â  At the trial, the court admitted the confession and charged the jury regarding the legal standard relevant for determining the voluntariness of the confession.Â  \r\n \r\nWe find that the instant case stands in stark contrast to the cases in federal and other state courts where courts have â€œset aside convictions . . . because they were based on confessions admitted under circumstances that offended the requirements of â€˜due process.â€™â€Â  Haley, 332 U.S. at 305.Â  Although courts have given confessions by juveniles special scrutiny, courts generally do not find a juvenileâ€™s confession involuntary where there is no evidence of extended, intimidating questioning or some other form of coercion.[8]Â  Appellant in effect asks this Court to adopt a rule that the United States Supreme Court and other courts have strictly declined to adopt: that confessions of juveniles are per se involuntary if they are obtained without the presence of counsel, a parent, or other interested adult.[9]\r\nIn this case, Appellant has presented no evidence, other than his age, supporting his claim that his confession was involuntary.Â  Appellant instead relies exclusively on abstract scientific data and rhetorical questions for his argument.Â  This evidence is not probative of coercion. \r\n \r\nAdditionally, we reject the dissentâ€™s assertion that Appellantâ€™s confession cannot be said to be voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.Â  While the dissent emphasizes Appellantâ€™s age and behavioral issues to determine that the confession was involuntary under a totality of the circumstances analysis, the dissent ignores Appellantâ€™s actions in planning a scheme and developing an elaborate story to conceal his involvement in the crime.Â  Neither the dissent nor Appellant has shown any evidence that Appellant did not understand his rights or was of such low intelligence that he could not have understood his rights.Â  In fact, scrutinizing all of the surrounding circumstances, including Appellantâ€™s behavior and actions both before and after the killings, the record indicates that Appellant was capable of voluntarily giving the statement to the authorities.Â  The record contains no evidence that Appellant was not advised of his constitutional rights.Â  Furthermore, the record contains no indication that Appellant was subjected to prolonged detention as a suspect, required to withstand repeated and lengthy questioning sessions, or deprived in any way of sleep or food.Â  In fact, Appellant has presented no evidence whatsoever of coercive or improper police conduct in this investigation.Â  The record on appeal is simply void of the type of coercive action under which courts have previously found a juvenileâ€™s statement involuntary.Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in finding that Appellantâ€™s confession was voluntarily given or in submitting the confession to the jury.\r\nIX.&nbsp; Manslaughter Charge\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on the lesser included offenses of involuntary and voluntary manslaughter.Â  We disagree.\r\nA court may eliminate the offense of manslaughter where it clearly appears that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 264, 513 S.E.2d 104, 109 (1991).Â  An appellate court will not reverse the trial judge's decision absent an abuse of discretion. Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.&nbsp;&nbsp;Id. The refusal to grant a requested jury charge that states a sound principle of law applicable to the case at hand is an error of law. Â Id. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539.Â  The law to be charged must be determined&nbsp;from the evidence presented at trial.\r\nA.Â  Involuntary ManslaughterÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is (1) the unintentional killing of another without malice, but while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety of others.Â  State v. Tyler, 348 S.C. 526, 529, 560 S.E.2d 888, 889 (2002).Â Â  Recklessness is a state of mind in which the actor is aware of his or her conduct, yet consciously disregards a risk which his or her conduct is creating. See William Shepard McAninch &amp; W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina 12-15 (2d ed. 1989).Â  Recklessness has also been defined as â€œsomething more than mere negligence or carelessness . . . a conscious failure to exercise due care or ordinary care or a conscious indifference to the rights and safety of others or a reckless disregard thereof.â€Â  State v. Tucker, 273 S.C. 736, 739, 259 S.E.2d 414, 415 (1979).Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant argues that he was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge because the killing of his grandparents was unintentional and reckless.Â  In support of this argument, Appellant alleges that taking Zoloft was a â€œlawful activityâ€ because he was taking medicine prescribed to him by his doctor, and while under the influence of the legally ingested Zoloft, Appellant killed his grandparents â€œunintentionally.â€Â  Additionally, Appellant argues that, assuming he had the requisite capacity, Appellant was engaged in reckless conduct as evidenced by the fact that he pointed and shot a loaded shotgun at his grandparents. \r\n \r\nAt trial, the trial court and Appellantâ€™s attorneys discussed the logistics of an involuntary manslaughter charge extensively.Â  After considering all the arguments and the facts of the case, the court explained its reasons for not charging involuntary manslaughter.Â  Specifically, the trial court expressed reservation in accepting defense counselâ€™s argument that the ingestion of Zoloft satisfied the lawful act component required for an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  The trial court also found there was â€œno evidence under the law that this conduct was reckless conduct.â€Â  \r\n \r\nWe find that Appellantâ€™s conduct extends far beyond recklessness. Â The record reflects that after a confrontation with his grandfather, Appellant deliberately waited until his grandparents retired to bed, retrieved his shotgun, loaded the shotgun, entered their bedroom, and intentionally shot his grandparents. Although Appellant argues that the shootings were unintentional and reckless, he submitted no evidence to support that finding.Â  Like the trial court, we find the defenseâ€™s argument that the ingestion of Zoloft qualifies as a lawful act in the context of an involuntary manslaughter charge to be unconvincing.Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that the record contains no evidence upon which a jury could find that these killings were unintentional and a result of recklessness.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury regarding involuntary manslaughter.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; Voluntary Manslaughter\r\n\r\n\tVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation. Â Heat of passion alone will not suffice to reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter. Both heat of passion and sufficient legal provocation must be present at the time of the killing. Â The sudden heat of passion, upon sufficient legal provocation, which mitigates a felonious killing to manslaughter, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out knowledge and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nState v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 99, 525 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2000) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œTo warrant the court in eliminating the offense of manslaughter it should very clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.â€Â  Burriss, 334 S.C. at 264, 513 S.E.2d at 109.Â  In determining whether the evidence&nbsp;requires a charge of voluntary manslaughter, the Court views the facts in a light most favorable to the defendant.Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).\r\nBefore the case was submitted to the jury, the defense requested that if the court declined their request for an involuntary manslaughter charge, the court should charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter for a lesser included offense.Â  Although less preferable to involuntary manslaughter, the defense pursued this claim as a result of the Stateâ€™s assertion that Appellant murdered his grandparents because his grandfather beat him.\r\n1.Â  Sufficient Legal Provocation\r\nThe defense argued that, assuming the confession was accurate, Appellant killed his grandparents as a result of his grandfather beating him with a paddle.Â  Appellantâ€™s statement in the confession provides:\r\n\r\n\tI was going to get something to drink.Â  My granddad got the paddle.Â  I tried to get my shotgun.Â  He hit me on my back and my butt.Â  Then he said if I came out anymore he said he would hit me across the head with it.Â  He had beat me back into my room. He hit me 5 or 6 times.Â  Thatâ€™s what my dad used to hit me with.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe defense contends that this is sufficient legal provocation.Â Â  Contrarily, the State argues that the grandfather, as Appellantâ€™s guardian, was legally entitled to paddle him and therefore there was not sufficient legal provocation.Â  See State v. Norris, 253 S.C. 31, 39, 168 S.E.2d 564, 567 (1969) (â€œThe exercise of a legal right, no matter how offensive to another, is never in law deemed a provocation sufficient to justify or mitigate an act of violence.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nThis Court has previously held that an overt, threatening act or a physical encounter may constitute sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Gardner, 219 S.C. 97, 105, 64 S.E.2d 130, 134 (1951). Â Notwithstanding this proposition, we decline to hold that a child has sufficient legal provocation to use deadly force against a guardian who disciplines through corporal punishment.Â  \r\n \r\nHowever, even assuming that Appellant is entitled to a finding of sufficient legal provocation as related to the death of Appellantâ€™s grandfather, Appellant has not shown any sufficient legal provocation which would entitle him to the voluntary manslaughter charge as applied to the death of his grandmother.Â  Although Appellant claimed â€œthey beat me,â€ there is no evidence to show that his grandmother used the paddle on him.Â  Therefore, there could be no adequate provocation on her part.Â  Thus, under no circumstances could the trial court have erred in not charging the jury regarding voluntary manslaughter as it relates to the death of Appellantâ€™s grandmother.[10]\r\n2.Â  Sudden Heat of Passion\r\nThe defense contends that voluntary manslaughter is an appropriate charge because the killings were the result of a â€œspur of the moment thing in the wake of this spanking or beating.â€Â  Appellant also alleges in his brief that he was subjected to repeated beatings on the evening of the killings and was in constant fear of when the next beating might occur.[11] Â Conversely, the State contends that Appellantâ€™s actions signify â€œcool reflection,â€ and therefore a voluntary manslaughter charge was not warranted.Â Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œThe sudden heat of passion, upon sufficient legal provocation, which mitigates a felonious killing to manslaughter, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out knowledge and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the&nbsp;sway of reason, and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.â€Â  Knoten, 347 S.C. at 303, 555 S.E. 2d at 395.Â  Even when a personâ€™s passion has been sufficiently aroused by a legally adequate provocation, if at the time of the killing those passions had cooled or a sufficiently reasonable time had elapsed so that the passions of the ordinary reasonable person would have cooled, the killing would be murder and not manslaughter.Â  Id.Â  At the same time, â€œ[i]n determining whether an act which caused death was impelled by heat of passion or by malice, all the surrounding circumstances and conditions are to be taken into consideration, including previous relations and conditions connected with the tragedy, as well as those existing at the time of the killing.â€Â  Norris, 253 S.C. at 35, 168 S.E.2d at 566.Â  \r\n \r\nIn State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 525 S.E.2d 511, this Court found that a period of three to five minutes constituted a sufficient cooling off period. Â In Cole, a fight occurred between the victim and the defendant at the victimâ€™s home.Â  Id. Â Focusing on the actions of the defendant in the intervening time between the provocation and killing (as distinguished from the quantity of time that passed), the Court found that the actions taken by the defendant to go out to his car, get a knife and return to fatally stab the victim indicated â€œcool reflection.â€ Â Id.Â  \r\n\r\nThe dissent argues that the Court should not determine, as a matter of law, whether Appellant had a sufficient time in which to â€œcool off.â€Â  Instead, the dissent would find that whether a reasonable cooling time had elapsed is a question of fact for the jury.Â  While the law has not defined a bright-line rule for what constitutes a sufficient time for cooling off, this Court has determined that whether the defendantâ€™s actions during the intervening time between the provocation and the killing indicates the absence of sudden heat of passion is an appropriate question for the court.Â  See State v. Walker, 324 S.C. 257, 261, 478 S.E.2d 280, 281-82 (1996) (finding that the defendant demonstrated cool reflection through his actions between the alleged provocation and the killing); and State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 322-23, 474 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1996) (holding that the defendantâ€™s actions between the alleged provocation and killing did not support a finding of sudden heat of passion).\r\nAccording to Appellantâ€™s confession , Appellantâ€™s grandfather beat him with the paddle and sent him to his room.Â  Appellantâ€™s grandparents then went to bed for the night.Â  After they went to their room, Appellant waited for ten minutes, retrieved his shotgun, went back to his room to load it, and went to his grandparentsâ€™ bedroom where he shot them to death. According to Appellantâ€™s confession, the period between the â€œbeatingâ€ and the killings lasted more than ten minutes.Â  The methodical execution of the shootings, combined with the lapse of time between the beating and shootings, clearly indicates that Appellant did not kill his grandparents in a sudden heat of passion.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough it is possible that Appellant felt threatened at some point during the evening of the murders, there is no evidence to support the theory that Appellantâ€™s grandparents actually posed a threat to him when he fatally shot them.Â  At the time of the murders, Appellantâ€™s grandfather was no longer beating him with the paddle.Â  Furthermore, his grandparents were not even in the same room with Appellant when he retrieved the shotgun to shoot them; they had gone to bed for the night when the shooting occurred.Â  Taking into consideration all the surrounding circumstances and conditions, including previous relations and conditions connected with the tragedy, as well as those in existence at the time of the killing, the evidence did not warrant a voluntary manslaughter charge. \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury on the lesser included offenses of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Although sufficient legal provocation arguably existed as to one victim, these killings could not have occurred in the â€œheat of passion.â€\r\nX.&nbsp; Involuntary Intoxication\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court failed to properly charge the jury regarding involuntary intoxication.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina has adopted the Mâ€™Naughten test as the standard for determining whether a defendantâ€™s mental condition at the time of the offense rendered him criminally responsible. State v. South, 310 S.C. 504, 508, 427 S.E.2d 666, 669 (1993). Under this test, a defendant is considered legally insane if, at the time of the offense, he lacked the capacity to distinguish moral or legal right from wrong.Â  Id.Â  This Court has continuously utilized the Mâ€™Naughten test in criminal cases where issues of mental capacity are implicated.Â  See Id. at 504, 427 S.E.2d at 666; State v. Davenport, 301 S.C. 39, 389 S.E.2d 649 (1990); State v. Law, 270 S.C. 664, 244 S.E.2d 302 (1978); State v. Cannon, 260 S.C. 537, 197 S.E.2d 678 (1978).\r\nAt trial, Appellantâ€™s counsel expressed concerns about the charge to be given to the jury regarding involuntary intoxication.Â  The defense felt that the Mâ€™Naughten test did not accurately reflect the standard which should be used for involuntary intoxication defenses.Â  Instead, the defense suggested that the trial court charge the jury based on the Model Penal Code standard of inability to conform oneâ€™s conduct to the requirements of the law.Â  After much discussion, the trial court ultimately charged the Mâ€™Naughten standard as required under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-30 (2003).Â  However, the trial court also instructed the jury to find Appellant not guilty if they found involuntary intoxication in this case.Â Â  \r\n \r\nWe retain the Mâ€™Naughten test as the correct standard for determining whether a defendantâ€™s mental condition at the time of the offense rendered him criminally responsible.Â  The fact that other courts apply a different standard for the defense of involuntary intoxication is not dispositive. Further, Appellant has offered no other reason why this Court should adopt the Model Penal Code standard.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly charged the jury on this issue.\r\nXI.&nbsp; Excluded Evidence\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in excluding certain information regarding the effects of Zoloft.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nThe admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002). An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law. State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nGenerally, all relevant evidence is admissible. Rule 402, SCRE; State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001). Â Relevant evidence is â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€ Rule 401, SCRE. Relevant evidence may be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court allowed Appellant to present a copious amount of scientific evidence regarding Zoloft and other SSRIâ€™s.Â  The defense called prosecution expert Dr. James Ballenger.Â  During his testimony, he conceded that SSRIâ€™s can cause hypomania or mania in some people.Â  Additionally, Dr. David Healy testified that SSRIâ€™s could cause akathisia, emotional blunting, and mania.Â  Dr. Ronald Maris testified that the same mechanisms that could trigger a child taking Zoloft to commit suicide could also trigger one to harm another person.Â  Further, the defense presented testimony from a data specialist regarding adverse reaction data for SSRI manufacturers.Â  During his testimony, the specialist discussed various reports of depression, agitation, hallucinations, and akathisia.Â  The trial court also allowed the defense to present the anecdotal testimony of Bruce Orr regarding his negative experience with Paxil.Â  He testified that, as a result of taking Paxil, he became irritable, impulsive, and suicidal.Â  He further testified that the drug caused him to impulsively slam his own vehicle into his ex-wifeâ€™s vehicle and house.Â \r\n \r\nThe trial court did not allow Appellant to submit other anecdotal evidence regarding incidents which occurred in connection with the use of Zoloft.Â  Among other things, the court was concerned about the reliability of the anecdotal reports compared with the reliability of reports from clinical studies done in a controlled environment.Â  The court was also concerned with the trustworthiness of the sources of the anecdotal testimony, as well as the ability of experts to establish the causal link between the Zoloft and the incidents.Â  Despite these concerns, the trial court permitted the above expert testimony regarding Zoloft obtained from reliable methods, consistent with the South Carolina Rules of Evidence. \r\n \r\nThe record shows a conscientious decision on the part of the trial court to not admit evidence with questionable reliability where there was an abundance of other admissible evidence found to be reliable.Â Â  Additionally, the trial court correctly found that the prejudicial effects outweighed the probative value of the anecdotal evidence.Â  \r\n \r\nTherefore, we find the trial court did not err in excluding the anecdotal evidence regarding Zoloft.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s rulings as to all issues on appeal.Â Â  \r\n \r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nPLEICONES, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â Â Â  First, I cannot agree with the majority that the infliction of corporal punishment upon a child by his parent or guardian can never constitute legal provocation so as to entitle the child who kills his abuser to a voluntary manslaughter charge, nor do I agree that evidence in this case demonstrates the dissipation of the sudden heat of passion as a matter of law.Â  I would therefore hold the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter.Â  Second, I would adopt a prophylactic rule requiring that before police may conduct custodial interrogation of a child under the age of fourteen, he must first be permitted to consult with an interested adult. If he thereafter decides to waive his privilege against self-incrimination, I would require that the interested adult be present during the custodial interrogation.\r\nA. Voluntary Manslaughter\r\nWhen reviewing the trial courtâ€™s denial of a defendantâ€™s request for a voluntary manslaughter charge, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, and affirm that denial only where â€œthere is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.â€Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001) citing State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2000).Â  I simply cannot accept the majorityâ€™s rule, a rule unsupported by citation of authority, that the child-victim of a beating or other abuse at the hands of a parent or guardian, who retaliates against his tormentor and kills him, is ipso facto guilty of murder.Â  In this case, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, I would hold that a jury could find evidence of legal provocation giving rise to the heat of passion in the beating administered to appellant by his grandfather.\r\nÂ I agree with the majority that the facts in Cole demonstrated cooling off as a matter of law, especially since the defendant himself admitted that â€œhe had enough time to get his head together.â€Â  I am unable, however, to agree that this angry, emotionally ill child â€œcooled offâ€ as a matter of law in the ten minutes or so following the beating administered by his grandfather. In my opinion, it is for a jury and not this Court to determine whether appellantâ€™s actions in retrieving the gun, returning with it to his room, loading it, and proceeding to his grandparentsâ€™ bedroom are actions demonstrating â€œcool reflectionâ€ and â€œmethodical execution,â€ or whether, perhaps, these acts are consistent with a person acting under the â€œsudden heat of passion.â€Â  \r\n\r\nIn State v. Goodson, 140 S.C. 357, 138 S.E. 816 (1927) this Court surveyed the law related to â€œcooling offâ€ in reversing a murder conviction because the trial court refused to charge voluntary manslaughter.Â  In Goodson, the defendantâ€™s passion was incited on Tuesday afternoon and the victim shot and killed the next afternoon.Â  The Goodson court cited these passages from prior decisions, with approval:\r\n\r\n\tIn 13 R. C. L., 790, we find:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tâ€œWhat constitutes â€˜cooling time,â€™ as it ordinarily is termed, depends on the nature of man and the laws of the human mind, as well as on the nature and circumstances of the provocation, the extent to which the passions have been aroused, and the nature of the act causing the provocation, and therefore no precise time can be laid down by the Court as a rule of law, within which the passions must be held to have subsided and reason to have resumed its control.Â  The question is one of reasonable time, depending on all the circumstances of the particular case; and the law has not defined, and cannot, without gross injustice, define the precise time which shall be deemed reasonable, as it has with respect to notice of the dishonor of commercial paper.Â  What constitutes reasonable time in a particular case is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury; and the court cannot take it from the jury by assuming to decide it as a question of law.â€\r\n\t\tIn State v. McCants, 1 Speers, 390, the Court, in speaking of what is reasonable time for cooling, said:\r\n\t\tâ€œThe standard of what is reasonable, is ordinary human nature; to be applied by the Court, if all the facts and circumstances be found by a special verdict, or to be applied by the jury in giving a general verdict.Â  As to the reasonable time in which cooling should ensue after provocation, no precise rule can be given.â€\r\n\t\r\n\tIn the same case, at page 391, we find:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tâ€œIn all cases where the time of cooling may be considered, whether the time be regarded as evidence of the fact of cooling, or as constituting, of itself, when reasonable, legal deliberation, the whole circumstances are to be taken into the estimate in determining whether the time be reasonable.Â  The nature of the provocation, the prisonerâ€™s physical and mental constitution, his condition in life and peculiar situation at the time of the affair, his education and habits (not of themselves voluntary preparations for crime), his conduct, manner and conversation throughout the transaction; in a word, all pertinent circumstances may be considered, and the time in which an ordinary man, in like circumstances, would have cooled, is a reasonable time.â€\r\n\t\r\n\tState v. Goodson, 140 S.C. at 361-2, 138 S.E. at 817-8.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the trial court erred in declining to charge voluntary manslaughter.Â  State v. Goodson, supra.Â  I would therefore reverse appellantâ€™s convictions[12] and remand for a new trial.Â  Since the issue of the admissibility of his statement will most likely arise on retrial, I address the merits of that issue as well.\r\nB.Â  Admission of Appellantâ€™s Custodial Statement\r\nThe majority declines to adopt a per se rule that a juvenileâ€™s confession is inadmissible unless obtained in â€œthe presence of counsel, a parent, or other interested adult,â€ choosing instead to adhere to the â€œtotality of the circumstancesâ€ test for evaluating the voluntariness of a juvenileâ€™s confession.Â  In my opinion, appellantâ€™s confession does not pass the totality test.Â  Moreover, I would adopt the following prophylactic rule:\r\n\r\n\tBefore a child under the age of fourteen may waive his privilege against self-incrimination and submit to custodial interrogation, he must have the opportunity to consult with an interested adult and, if the child waives the privilege, to have that adult present throughout the interrogation.Â  An interested adult means a parent or guardian whose interests are not adverse to that of the childâ€™s, or an attorney.\r\n\r\nWhile such a rule is not required verbatimet litteration by the Constitution, in my opinion it will best serve to protect the interests of society, law enforcement, and the minor.[13]\r\n\r\n\tAs the Supreme Court explained in 1967,\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe privilege against self-incrimination is, of course, related to the question of the safeguards necessary to assure that admissions or confessions are reasonably trustworthy, that they are not mere fruits of fear or coercion, but are reliable expressions of the truth.Â  The roots of the privilege are, however, far deeper.Â  They tap the basic stream of religious and political principle because the privilege reflects the limits of the individualâ€™s atonement to the state and - in a philosophical sense - insists upon the equality of the individual and the state.Â  In other words, the privilege has a broader and deeper thrust than the rule which prevents the use of confessions which are the product of coercion because coercion is thought to carry with it the danger of unreliability.Â  One of its purposes is to prevent the state, whether by force or by psychological domination, from overcoming the mind and will of the person under investigation and depriving him of the freedom to decide whether to assist the state in securing his conviction.\r\n\t\tIn re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 47 (1967).\r\n\t\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Gault Court, while not requiring the â€œinterested adultâ€ rule in the context of juvenile adjudication[14] went on to hold:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWe conclude that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is applicable in the case of juveniles as it is with respect to adults.Â  We appreciate that special problems may arise with respect to waiver of the privilege by or on behalf of children, and that there may well be some differences in technique - but not in principle - depending upon the age of the child and the presence and competence of parents.Â  The participation of counsel will, of course, assist the police, Juvenile Courts and appellate tribunals in administering the privilege.Â  If counsel was not present for some permissible reason when an admission was obtained, the greatest care must be taken to assure that the admission was voluntary, in the sense not only that it was not coerced or suggested, but also that it was not the product of ignorance of rights or of adolescent fantasy, fright or despair.\r\n\t\tId. at 55.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nI would apply the â€œinterested adultâ€ rule only to children under fourteen years of age.Â  At common law, a child under fourteen is prima facie doli incapax.Â  State v. Toney, 15 S.C. 409 (1881).Â  The presumption that these children are incapable of committing a crime is founded â€œ[o]ut of tenderness to infants - the ease with which they may be misled - their want of foresight and their wayward dispositionâ€¦.â€Â  Id. at 414.Â  Even at fifteen, such â€œa mere child [is] an easy victim of the lawâ€¦15 is a tender and difficult age for a boyâ€¦[who] cannot be judged by the more exacting standards of maturity.Â  That which would leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a lad in his early teens.â€Â  Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 599 (1948).\r\nI do not doubt that a child of between the ages of seven and fourteen may be capable of understanding the difference between right and wrong, and thus capable of committing a criminal offense.Â  The ability to distinguish right from wrong is not, in my opinion, determinative whether the child is capable of a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his constitutional rights.Â  South Carolina statutes, as well as court rules, are replete with examples where a distinction is drawn between children under fourteen and those fourteen or older.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-140 et seq. (minors fourteen or over may petition for custodial payments or an accounting, or designate a successor custodian under the â€œSouth Carolina Uniform Gifts to Minors Actâ€); Â§Â§ 62-5-410; -407 (minors aged fourteen years old and above may be considered for certain probate court appointments); Â§ 20-7-1690(A)(1) (children aged fourteen and up must consent to their adoption); Â§ 23-35-120(1) (legally purchase fireworks without a parent); Rule 4(d)(2), SCRCP (child under fourteen cannot be directly served with process); Rule 17(d)(3), (5) (child under fourteen, like an incompetent person, cannot petition for the appointment of his own guardian ad litem); cf. S.C.Const. art. III, Â§ 34 (unmarried woman under fourteen cannot consent to sexual intercourse).\r\n \r\nThe law presumes that minors are incapable of making certain decisions which carry with them serious legal consequences.Â  See statutes and rule cited above; see also Â§ 20-1-100 (persons under sixteen â€œnot capable of entering into a valid marriageâ€); Â§ 20-7-250 (in general, contracts made during infancy must be ratified in unity after â€œfull ageâ€ to be enforceable).Â  At issue here is the minorâ€™s decision whether to â€œassist the state in securing his convictions,â€ the consequences of which are at least as far reaching as the decision to marry or to enter a contract.Â  In my opinion, it best serves the interests of society to require that minors, under the age of fourteen, whom the law in all other respects treats as it does incompetent adults, consult with an interested adult before waiving their privilege against self-incrimination.\r\nEven if we do not adopt this rule today, it is my opinion that appellantâ€™s confession cannot be said to be voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.Â  The undisputed facts demonstrate that appellant, aged twelve, had received inpatient treatment for depression before coming to live with his grandparents.Â  His prescription medicine had been changed, and there was evidence that his condition was deteriorating.Â  On the day before the killings, appellant assaulted a young child, and on the day itself, appellant had been taken from school by his grandparents.Â  An individual observed appellant that evening demonstrating bad behavior and an angry attitude.Â  Later that evening appellant was â€œpaddledâ€ by his grandfather: ten minutes later appellant shot and killed both his grandparents.\r\nAppellant then set a fire, took money, weapons, and his dog and left in his grandparentsâ€™ vehicle.Â  The next morning appellant was found in the woods.Â  During the day, appellant was befriended by Deputy McKellar and they spent the next four hours talking, eating and playing cards.Â  Later that afternoon, about 3 p.m., McKellar took appellant to the police station after his status was changed from victim to suspect.Â  At the station McKellar told appellant it was time for an adult conversation and explained to appellant his Miranda rights.Â  Another officer entered the room, apparently assuming the role of the â€œbad cop.â€Â  McKellar asked appellant about a bible verse he had mentioned earlier, and the other officer asked appellant what his grandparents would think about his lack of truthfulness. Â At this point, appellant confessed.\r\nMyriad factors are to be considered when reviewing the totality of circumstances attendant upon a minorâ€™s waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination.Â  While age is certainly an important factor, it alone is not determinative.Â  In re Williams, 265 S.C. 295, 217 S.E.2d 719 (1975).Â  However, according to one commentator, â€œInvariably, the cases that hold that age alone is not determinative of the effectiveness of the waiver [in the absence of an interested adult] have involved minors who were fourteen years of age or older, and most often sixteen or seventeen.â€Â  Davis, Rights of Juveniles 2d 175 (2006).Â  Other factors which must be considered in determining the validity of a minorâ€™s waiver include â€œintelligence, education, experience, and ability to comprehend the meaning and effect of his statement.â€Â  In re Williams, 265 S.C. at 300, 217 S.E.2d at 722(internal citations omitted). \r\n \r\nHere, a twelve year old emotionally disturbed child with no prior experience with the justice system waived his rights approximately eighteen hours after killing his grandparents, having spent the night in the woods, the midday in the company of a sympathetic officer,[15] napping occasionally, playing cards, eating, and talking before being taken to the police station where the atmosphere changed from compassionate care to interrogation.Â  Viewing the totality of these circumstances â€œwith the greatest care,â€[16] I am unconvinced that appellantâ€™s decision to waive his privilege was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.Â  Upon retrial, I would hold the statement inadmissible because it was obtained without the advice and consent of an interested adult, and because under the totality of the circumstances appellantâ€™s waiver does not pass constitutional muster.\r\nI would reverse appellantâ€™s convictions and sentences, and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\r\n[1] Both Paxil and Zoloft are part of the antidepressant classification of drugs called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs.Â Â \r\n \r\n[2] The statute defines child as â€œa person less than seventeen years of age.â€Â  However, the definition is further limited for instances involving certain felony charges.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-6605(1) (2003).\r\n[3] Whether this statute suffers from a constitutional deficiency is a matter wholly separate from determining its clear intent.Â  Although Appellant makes veiled allegations regarding the constitutionality of the statute at issue in Corey D., he does not ask this Court to review either the constitutionality of Corey D. or the statute.\r\n[4] This proposition actually appears as a quotation in Standard, and is drawn from the United States Supreme Court case Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 821 (1988) (citing Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)).Â  In both Thompson and Trop, the court relied on Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910) for this proposition.Â  See Thompson, 356 U.S. at 821, Trop, 356 U.S. at 100.Â  In Weems, the court stated:\r\n\r\n\tTime works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes. Therefore a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gives it birth.\r\n\t***\r\n\tThe [cruel and unusual punishments clause] in the opinion of the learned commentators may be therefore progressive, and is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.\r\n\r\nId. at 373-78.Â  This has become the touchstone of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.Â  See Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 560 (2005); see also Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 311-312 (2002).Â Â  \r\n \r\n[5] This entire list, excluding Avery and Sanders, was set forth in Standard, 351 S.C. at 205, 569 S.E.2d at 329.Â  \r\n \r\n[6] Stated differently, a firmly anchored principle of our society is that â€œimportant human values are sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a conviction, wrings a confession out of an accused against his will.â€Â  Jackson, 378 U.S. at 386 (quoting Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 206-07 (1960)).\r\n[7] For example, the court stated:  \r\n\r\n\tThat which would leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe a lad in his early teens . . . we cannot believe that a lad of tender years is a match for the police in such a contest.Â  He needs counsel and support if he is not to become the victim first of fear, then of panic.Â  He needs someone on whom to lean lest the overpowering presence of the law, as he knows it, may not crush him.\r\n\r\nHaley, 332 U.S. at 599-600.Â  Similarly:\r\n\r\n\t[A juvenile] cannot be compared with an adult in full possession of his senses and knowledgeable of the consequences of his admissions. He would have no way of knowing what the consequences of his confession were without advice as to his rights-from someone concerned with securing him those rights-and without the aid of more mature judgment as to the steps he should take in the predicament in which he found himself. A lawyer or an adult relative or friend could have given the Appellant the protection which his own immaturity could not. Adult advice would have put him on a less unequal footing with his interrogators. Without some adult protection against this inequality, a 14-year-old boy would not be able to know, let alone assert, such constitutional rights as he had. To allow this conviction to stand would, in effect, be to treat him as if he had no constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nGallegos, 370 U.S. at 54-55.\r\n[8] See State v. Thomas, 447 F.2d 1320, 1321-22 (4th Cir. 1971) (fifteen-year-old who dropped out of school before finishing the fifth grade was taken into custody around midnight, questioned until approximately 4:30 a.m., and then again beginning at 7:30 a.m. and lasting until approximately 5:00 p.m.Â  During this time, a team of officers rotated interrogations and also drove the defendant to various crime scenes while inquiring about his involvement in the offences.); Gallegos, 370 U.S. at 52 (fourteen-year-old defendant held in police custody with no visitation for five days and questioned by a team of prosecutors for a continuous 36-hour period without sleep); Haley, 332 U.S. at 597-98 (fifteen-year-old defendant questioned for about five hours beginning around midnight and not informed of his right to counsel).\r\n[9] Appellant only presents this argument â€œin effect.â€Â  Instead of articulating this position, Appellant posits only that this confession was involuntary.Â  This Court rejected a per se rule in Jenkins, 265 S.C. at 300, 217 S.E.2d at 721-22, and because we are not asked to revisit that holding today, we do not do so.Â  For this reason the dissentâ€™s adoption of a prophylactic rule proceeds beyond the scope of the case Appellant has presented for our review.Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, even had the Appellant requested such relief, such a rule is not required by the Constitution.Â  Furthermore, the dissentâ€™s reliance on In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967), to support the adoption of the prophylactic rule is misplaced.Â  In In re Gault, the United States Supreme Court held that certain juvenile proceedings required the same due process protections afforded to adults in criminal proceedings.Â  Id.Â  While the Court noted that great care should be taken to assure the voluntariness of an admission by a child, the Court did not find that the standards of voluntariness or waiver for juveniles differs from the standard used for adults.Â  See id. at 55. Â It is for this reason that we analyze this confession under the totality of the circumstances.Â  To safeguard Constitutional rights, the Constitutional standard ought to suffice.Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly, we adhere to our previous decisions requiring only that a confession or admission of a juvenile be found voluntary under a totality of the circumstances analysis.Â  As the dissent points out, the legislature has determined that under some circumstances a minorâ€™s rights should be restricted or that a minor should be afforded protections not extended to adults.Â  Similarly, we think the decision of whether an interested adult need be present for a juvenile to give a voluntary confession is best left to the discretion of the legislature.Â Â \r\n \r\n[10] The dissent argues that, in the absence of Appellantâ€™s confession, Appellant would be entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge for the killing of his grandmother under the theory of transferred intent.Â  However, the dissent fails to recognize that Appellantâ€™s entire argument for the voluntary manslaughter charge rests on the allegation that Appellantâ€™s grandfather beat him with a paddle; an allegation which is only found in the confession.Â  Therefore, if the confession is excluded, Appellant has no basis for asserting that he had sufficient legal provocation and would not be entitled to the voluntary manslaughter charge in either case.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n[11] Appellant refers to the confession to support the allegation of repeated beatings.Â  The confession states, â€œ[h]e hit me 5 or 6 times.â€Â  This statement implies that the hits occurred in one incident and not multiple incidents as Appellantâ€™s brief implies.\r\n[12] While the grandfatherâ€™s actions supplied the legal provocation, it is unclear from the record, in the absence of appellantâ€™s confession, whether he intended to shoot his grandmother or whether she was the unintended victim of appellantâ€™s â€œmanslaughter intentâ€ state of mind directed at his grandfather.Â  Since intent is unclear, I would reverse and remand appellantâ€™s conviction for the murder of his grandmother as well as his conviction for the killing of his grandfather.Â  E.g., State v. Gandy, 283 S.C. 571, 324 S.E.2d 65 (1984) overruled on other grounds Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 (1991). \r\n \r\n[13] I believe such a prophylactic rule, much like that established by Miranda v. Arizona, 384Â  U.S. 436 (1966), will ensure that waivers by children under the age of fourteen are voluntary within the meaning of the 5th Amendment.\r\n[14] The present case, of course, involves the trial of a juvenile as an adult.\r\n[15] I do not suggest that Deputy McKellar did anything improper.\r\n[16] In re Gault, supra at 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26340","title":"In the Matter of Eduardo Curry","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26340","description":"This is an attorney discipline matter in which the Court imposed a definite suspension.","date":"2007-06-11","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Eduardo Curry, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26340\r\nHeard April 3, 2007 - Filed June 11, 2007Â Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHenry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tComing B. Gibbs, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an attorney discipline case involving two separate instances of misconduct by respondent. Â The Commission on Lawyer Conduct Full Panel (Panel) adopted the report of the sub-panel, which recommended the following sanctions: (1) 30 day suspension; (2) respondent be required to obtain the services of a certified public accountant and an attorney to review compliance with Rule 417, SCACR; (3) respondent must submit affidavits from the CPA and attorney every six months for a period of three years to show compliance with Rule 417, SCACR; and (4) respondent be ordered to pay costs of proceedings.Â  Â  \r\n \r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) appeals and asks for a harsher sanction, contending the Panel erred in its findings on respondentâ€™s alleged Rule 403, SCACR, violations and in its consideration of certain mitigating circumstances.Â  We agree with ODC and impose a six month suspension and the other conditions recommended by the Panel.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis proceeding involves two separate matters arising out of a complaint filed with the Commission in 2002.Â  An investigative panel authorized formal charges in November 2004.Â  The hearing before the sub-panel was held in April 2005, and due to delay in receiving the transcript, the report of the sub-panel was not issued until July 2006.Â  In September 2006, the Panel adopted the report.Â  \r\n \r\nMatter A\r\nThis matter arises from a prior disciplinary action that ended in 2001 with a deferred disciplinary agreement (DDA).Â  The DDA concerned respondentâ€™s failure to obtain Rule 403 certification.Â  A complaint had been filed against respondent for appearing in court without Rule 403 certification, but respondent asserted in 2001 that he had complied with the rule.Â  However, no certification could be found in the Courtâ€™s files.\r\nThe DDA prevented respondent from appearing in court without meeting the requirements of Rule 403.Â  It did not order respondent to obtain the trial experiences and certification required by Rule 403, but if he did, respondent was required to file an affidavit and a copy of his compliance certificate with ODC.Â  This agreement was accepted by the Commission on July 20, 2001.\r\nWe must now determine whether respondentâ€™s conduct after 2001 violated the terms of his DDA and Rule 403.Â  In an attorney disciplinary proceeding, this Court gives great deference to the recommendation of the Panel.Â  In re Myers, 355 S.C. 1, 584 S.E.2d 357 (2003). Â However, we exercise de novo review of the Panelâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n\tRule 403(a), SCACR, provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[A]n attorney shall not appear as counsel in any hearing, trial, or deposition in a caseâ€¦until the attorneyâ€™s trial experiences required by this rule have been approved by the Supreme Court.Â  An attorney whose trial experiences have not been approved may appear as counsel if the attorney is accompanied by an attorney whose trial experiences have been approved by this ruleâ€¦and the other attorney is present throughout the hearing, trial, or deposition.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have previously disciplined an attorney for, among other ethical violations, appearing in court without proper certification under Rule 403.Â  In re Moore, 345 S.C. 144, 546 S.E.2d 651 (2001).Â  We noted in Moore that, absent Rule 403 certification, a lawyer is not entitled to â€œappear alone in courts of record in South Carolina.â€Â  Id. at 149, 653.\r\nAfter the complaint was filed in 2002, ODC reviewed respondentâ€™s file and found no affidavit or certificate of compliance with Rule 403.Â  Upon written inquiry by ODC, respondent responded that he had not completed his Rule 403 requirements and that he had not appeared alone in a trial.Â  Respondent did inform ODC that he was in the process of obtaining certification.Â  However, respondent later admitted that he appeared alone at depositions.\r\nUpon investigation, ODC alleged ethical violations in respondentâ€™s efforts to obtain Rule 403 certification.Â  Several attorneys testified at the sub-panel hearing in regards to this matter.Â \r\n \r\nAttorney A testified that he worked as co-counsel with respondent in two cases.Â  However, Attorney A was not aware that respondent lacked Rule 403 certification, that respondent considered his presence to be for the purpose of Rule 403 compliance, nor did respondent ever ask Attorney A to appear specifically as Rule 403 counsel.\r\nAttorney B testified that he appeared with respondent at one or two hearings, two or three guilty pleas, and one deposition.Â  Attorney B was not aware that respondent lacked Rule 403 certification and did not consider his presence to be for respondentâ€™s compliance with Rule 403.Â \r\n \r\nAttorney C, respondentâ€™s law partner, testified that he attended numerous hearings, trials, and depositions with respondent for the purpose of acting as respondentâ€™s Rule 403-certified co-counsel.Â  However, Attorney C testified that he sat in the audience and did not participate in the proceedings.Â  He also acknowledged that there were occasions where respondent asked him to go to court and he was not available.\r\nThe Panel then identified four different circumstances involving respondent that potentially violated Rule 403 and respondentâ€™s DDA.\r\nThe first circumstance identified by the Panel was respondentâ€™s appearance at depositions without a Rule 403-certified attorney.Â  Respondent admitted to appearing alone at depositions but indicated he relied upon the DDA language which only prohibited solo appearances â€œin court.â€Â  The Panel noted that respondent was required to comply with Rule 403, and his failure to insure strict compliance violated the rule.Â  This finding is not in dispute.\r\nThe second circumstance was respondentâ€™s appearance alone at status and pre-trial conferences, roll calls, and roster meetings.Â  The Panel concluded that respondentâ€™s conduct did not violate Rule 403 and the DDA.Â  Citing the ambiguity between pre-2000 Rule 403 (â€œactual conduct and trial of a caseâ€), post-2000 Rule 403 (â€œhearing, trial, or depositionâ€), DDA (â€œwill not appear in courtâ€), and In re Moore (â€œcourts of recordâ€), the Panel found that Rule 403 did not specifically prohibit appearances at these types of hearings.\r\nODC objects to this finding of the Panel.Â  ODC posits that no ambiguity exists because appearances at pretrial and status conferences are appearances in court, which are prohibited by the DDA, Moore, and Rule 403.[1]Â  In addition, ODC contends that even if the rule were unclear, the DDA clearly prohibited appearances in court.Â  We agree with ODC.\r\nRule 403 (â€œhearingsâ€) and the DDA (â€œwill not appear in courtâ€) clearly encompass respondentâ€™s appearance at pretrial and status conferences.Â  The appearances at these official court proceedings were prohibited by the language of the DDA and Rule 403, and respondent violated the rule and the DDA by appearing in these situations.\r\nThe third questionable action identified by the Panel was respondentâ€™s appearances with Rule 403-certified co-counsel.Â  ODC asserted that attendance by co-counsel does not satisfy Rule 403 if the certified counsel is unaware that he is present for purposes of Rule 403.Â  The Panel decided that neither Rule 403 nor prior case law require knowledge by the certified co-counsel of the uncertified attorneyâ€™s lack of Rule 403 certification.Â  The Panel found that it could not rewrite the rule or the DDA to require knowledge by the accompanying attorney, and it concluded that the mere appearance of a certified attorney met respondentâ€™s requirements.\r\nODC objects to this finding, arguing that the purpose of Rule 403 is defeated if certified co-counsel is unaware that he is considered present pursuant to Rule 403. Â We agree.\r\n \r\nRespondent admitted he did not inform the attorneys who accompanied him that their presence was needed for compliance with Rule 403.Â  This defeats the purpose of Rule 403.Â  The rule allows an attorney to gain trial experiences by actively participating in court proceedings while in the presence of a certified attorney who is available to assist when necessary.Â  A certified attorneyâ€™s â€œpresenceâ€ means more than mere physical presence; he must be aware of his reason for being present so that he is prepared to aid the uncertified attorney.Â  We find the Panel erred in failing to find respondent in violation of Rule 403 for these appearances when certified counsel was not made aware of the reason for their presence.\r\nThe final circumstance involved respondentâ€™s appearances with Attorney C, who knew his presence was for respondentâ€™s compliance with Rule 403.Â  Attorney C admitted that on several occasions he had occupied himself with his own clientsâ€™ business while respondent was in court.Â  The Panel found that Attorney Câ€™s presence and ability to provide guidance if needed, along with his knowledge that he was respondentâ€™s certified co-counsel, complied with the rule and the DDA.\r\nODC objects to this finding, arguing that the requirement of a Rule 403-certified counsel to be present throughout the proceeding means more than physical presence.Â  ODC argues that if Attorney C occupied himself with his own business, respondent did not have a certified attorney â€œpresentâ€ in the mental sense.Â  We agree.\r\nMuch like the certified attorney who is less prepared to assist because he is unaware the attorney is attempting to acquire Rule 403 certification, a certified attorney who tends to his own business is not â€œpresentâ€ for purposes of Rule 403.Â \r\n \r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s actions in these four situations constituted a willful violation of his prior DDA and Rule 403.\r\nMatter B\r\nThis matter arises from a complaint filed by Doctor A, a chiropractor, who treated several of respondentâ€™s clients for injuries related to personal injury claims.Â  Doctor A alleged that respondent failed to pay medical bills on behalf of clients following successful resolution of their cases.Â \r\n \r\nUpon receiving notice of Doctor Aâ€™s grievance, respondent issued checks from his trust account for the amounts claimed by Doctor A for each client.Â  Respondent did not review his client files or trust account records before writing the checks.Â  In two cases, respondent issued checks on behalf of clients, yet no funds were held in his trust account for those clients.Â  \r\n \r\nIn two other instances, respondent had not sent checks to Doctor A even though his client ledgers and settlement statements showed that the checks had been written.Â  Additionally, in the nine to ten months between the time respondent allegedly wrote the checks and the time he actually sent the checks to Doctor A, respondentâ€™s trust account balance dropped numerous times below the amount he was holding on behalf of these clients.Â  Respondent claimed he paid Doctor A out of fees earned for other clients but not yet withdrawn from his trust account.Â  After investigation, ODC found numerous violations involving respondentâ€™s trust account and recordkeeping.Â  The findings by the Panel in regards to Matter B are not in dispute.\r\nUpon the commencement of formal proceedings against respondent, he admitted the following: (a) he failed to reconcile his trust account on a monthly basis; (b) he failed to withdraw fees from his trust account when earned; (c) he failed to keep records of earned fees remaining in his trust account; (d) he routinely paid law firm expenses, including payroll, from his trust account; (e) he routinely paid personal expenses, including credit card and phone bills, from his trust account; (f) he failed to maintain an accurate and current accounting journal; and (g) he routinely advanced litigation costs for clients from his trust account when no funds were deposited for that purpose.\r\n \r\nRespondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR, with regard to Matter B: Rule 1.15(a) (lawyers must hold client funds separately and maintain a complete record of those funds); Rule 1.15(b) (possession of funds in which a third party has an interest); Rule 1.3 (diligence); Rule 4.4 (respect for rights of third persons); Rule 5.1 (responsibilities of partner or supervisory lawyer);Â  Rule 5.3 (responsibilities regarding nonlawyer assistants); and Rule 8.1 (misrepresentation in disciplinary matter).Â  The Panel also found violations of Rule 417, SCACR, for respondentâ€™s financial recordkeeping deficiencies.\r\nMitigating Circumstances\r\nIn 2002, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) improperly levied on just over $5,000 from respondentâ€™s trust account for failure to pay quarterly payroll taxes.Â  The IRS should have levied respondentâ€™s operating account.Â  Respondent could not recall when the money was returned.\r\nThe Panel noted that respondent had no control over an IRS levy against his trust account, and the Panel viewed the IRS levy as mitigating evidence.Â  ODC objects to this finding, arguing that the negative client balances in the trust account for two of respondentâ€™s clients occurred before the IRS levy and continued after the money was returned.Â  In addition, the IRS levy resulted from respondentâ€™s own failure to pay taxes, and ODC alleges that respondent failed to discover the levy because he did not reconcile his trust account.Â  Finally, ODC contends that respondent should have immediately replenished the missing funds from his trust account with his personal funds.\r\nWe believe the erroneous levy by the IRS on respondentâ€™s trust account was unexpected and unpreventable.Â  We keep it in mind when determining a proper sanction.\r\nThe Panel also noted the substantial delay in the disciplinary proceedings as evidence of mitigation.Â  The grievance was filed and investigation began in 2002, formal proceedings began in 2004, and the hearing was held in 2005.Â  Due to delays in obtaining the transcript, the sub-panel report was not issued until July 2006.Â  \r\n \r\nODC objects to the finding of a substantial delay in the proceedings and challenges the use of such a factor in mitigation.Â  ODC cites the fact that problems concerning respondentâ€™s trust account did not appear until after the investigation had begun into Doctor Aâ€™s complaint.Â  ODC also noted that respondentâ€™s assurances that he was still in compliance with the DDA prevented investigation of Matter A until 2004.Â  Furthermore, ODC contends that much of the delay was due to respondentâ€™s failure to supply adequate financial records and ODCâ€™s difficulty in reconstructing trust account transactions.Â  ODC acknowledges the delay in obtaining the transcript of the hearing and in drafting the sub-panel report but maintains such delay is not attributable to either party.\r\nWe agree with ODC that the substantial delay in the proceedings is not attributable to respondent or to ODC.Â  We do not consider the delay to be an aggravating or a mitigating circumstance.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nODC objects to the Panelâ€™s recommendation of a thirty day suspension.Â  Citing past cases, ODC seeks a harsher sanction for respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  We are not bound by the Panelâ€™s recommendation but rather administer the sanction we deem appropriate after a thorough review of the record.Â  In re Strickland, 354 S.C. 169, 580 S.E.2d 126 (2003).Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough we are aware of respondentâ€™s good reputation and positive achievements, we cannot overlook the serious violations that have occurred.Â  Accordingly, we adopt all sanctions recommended by the Panel and increase respondentâ€™s suspension from the practice of law to six months.Â  Within sixty (60) days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall pay costs associated with this proceeding in the amount of $2645.11.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We agree with ODC that the pre-2000 version of Rule 403 that was in effect prior to the DDA and prior to the appearances that are at issue in this action is not relevant to our analysis.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Â See In the Matter of Craven, 371 S.C. 393, 639 S.E.2d 150 (2006).Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 2001.Â  His practice primarily involved trademark and copyright law.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent asserts that he began using cocaine in an attempt to deal with the death of a loved one and other personal problems.Â  Respondentâ€™s use of cocaine increased until it became a severely debilitating condition which contributed to his divorce, the dissolution of his law firm, the eviction from his law office building, the inability to properly represent his clients, and a virtual abandonment of his law practice for a short period of time.Â  Respondent now recognizes that, at least for a short period of time during the later stages of his addiction, he was unable to provide competent, diligent representation to several of his clients and he did not adequately communicate with some of his clients about matters he had undertaken to handle for them.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent sought help from Lawyers Helping Lawyers and voluntarily entered a detoxification facility.Â  The director of Lawyers Helping Lawyers advises that respondent has been fully compliant with his recommendations, appears to be free from the use of cocaine, and that he expects respondent to abstain from the use of cocaine indefinitely.Â \r\n \r\nDuring the period of his addiction, respondent made numerous deposits to and withdrawals from his trust account which should have been deposited into and drawn out of his operating account.Â  On numerous occasions respondent negotiated checks on his trust account which should have been negotiated out of his operating account or his personal bank account.Â  These checks included, but are not necessarily limited to, a refund of a retainer to a client which respondent had already expended as an earned fee, payment to a restaurant for a meal, payment of a credit card statement, payments directly to himself, and five checks payable to a liquor store for cash.Â  On several occasions in March 2006, there were overdrafts and/or negative balances in respondentâ€™s trust account.Â Â  Â Â \r\nRespondent did not reconcile his trust account in accordance with the requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  He did not maintain ledger records so as to be able to readily determine the amount held in the trust account for each client and did not keep other records required by the rule.[1] Â Â Â \r\nRespondent received $275 for filing fees from a client related to a trademark application.Â  Respondent represents he completed the initial portion of the work for the client but should have been holding the sum for other filing fees for additional work that was contemplated between respondent and the client.Â  When respondentâ€™s trust account obtained a negative balance as a result of checks written on the account for respondentâ€™s personal purposes, respondent effectively used the $275 for purposes other than intended.Â  Respondent represents he has subsequently repaid this client.Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent represents that, with the exception of the $275, the money spent from the trust account actually belonged to himself.Â  Â However, he agrees that in withdrawing the funds in the manner stated, respondent could not readily identify the source of the monies withdrawn.Â  Respondent acknowledges it constituted misconduct to use the $275 for purposes other than intended, to commingle his personal monies with the monies of others in his trust account, to use his trust account as a personal checking account, to write checks to himself and/or for cash, and to fail to comply with the recordkeeping and money handling provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct and Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\n \r\nOn at least one occasion after being placed on interim suspension, respondent contacted a client, gave the client a closed file to demonstrate he had in fact completed his legal services to that client prior to his suspension and to support his request to the client for the payment of a $500 fee (computed by respondent to be the balance due for an earned fee on the matter).Â  Respondent now recognizes that, once placed on interim suspension, his client files and earned fees became the responsibility of the attorney appointed by the Court to protect the interests of respondentâ€™s clients.Â  See Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nIn accordance with the terms of the Agreement, respondent agreed as follows:Â  1) to make arrangements for random drug tests by Lab Corp (or some other facility the parties would agree upon in writing) [2] no less frequently than every 90 days;[3] 2) to continue to submit to random drug testing during the period of suspension imposed by the Court and, should he be reinstated to the practice of law, for a period of one year after his reinstatement; 3) to pay all costs associated with the drug tests when due; and 4) to cause all test reports to be sent directly from the testing facility to ODC, if the drug testing facility will do so and, if not, to forward the original of all reports within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the reports by respondent.Â \r\n \r\nIn addition, respondent agreed that his failure to strictly comply with the testing provisions in the Agreement or the indication of the use of illegal drugs in any report shall be grounds for additional disciplinary proceedings.Â  Further, respondent agreed that, if he is reinstated to the practice of law and, thereafter, fails to strictly comply with the testing provisions in the Agreement or should any report indicate the use of illegal drugs, he would be subject to interim suspension from the practice of law upon presentment of any report, copies thereof, or an affidavit of lack of receipt of the reports by ODC as required by the Agreement.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent and ODC stipulated and agreed that the drug testing reports or copies thereof shall be presumed admissible in any and all proceeding before the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, the Committee on Character and Fitness, and the Court without the necessity of ODC having such reports identified and/or authenticated by any personnel of the testing facility.Â  While respondent shall be entitled to challenge any test results he deems inaccurate, the reported results shall be presumed accurate and the burden of proof shall be on respondent to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any report by the clear and convincing standard.Â \r\n \r\nFinally, prior to filing a Petition for Reinstatement, respondent agrees to pay $182 to the court reporter who transcribed his on-the-record, under oath interview.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent has no prior disciplinary history.Â  To the best knowledge and belief of ODC, respondent has fully cooperated with inquiries into this matter, including voluntarily submitting to an on-the-record, under oath interview, waiving the formalities of time and notice and doing so without requiring prior notice of matters to be addressed in the interview. The director of Lawyers Helping Lawyers advises respondent continues to work closely with the program and to follow his recommendations.Â  Respondent recognizes that the use of or addiction to mind altering substances is not a defense to disciplinary proceedings and offers information related thereto only as an admission of that misconduct and in mitigation of other misconduct.Â \r\n \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office), and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to willfully violate a valid court order issued by a court of this state).Â  In addition, respondent admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: \r\nÂ Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safekeep client Â property); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (lawyer shall not commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); and Rule 8.4(c) (it shall be professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude).Â  Further, respondent admits he has violated the financial recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose a two year definite suspension from the practice of law.Â  Respondentâ€™s request that the suspension be applied retroactively to the date of his interim suspension is denied.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent represents that, due to the nature of his practice, there were rarely any large sums of money in his trust account.Â  ODC has no basis to dispute this representation.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\n[2] The random drug tests shall be for standard reportable percentages of cocaine, marijuana, opiates, and other common illegal drugs routinely included in such a test.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] Respondent agreed to make the arrangements with a drug testing facility within fifteen (15) days of the date of the Agreement.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26342","title":"State v.

Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We now affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe body of the victim, Jason Ward, was found about 8:30 a.m. on January 28, 2001, behind the Boozer Shopping Center.Â  Richland County police investigated Wardâ€™s death initially by tracing his activities in the days leading up to his death.Â  The police determined Ward was with petitioner from approximately midnight on January 28 until his death.\r\nAround midnight, petitioner, Jeremiah Page, and several friends, most of whom had been drinking, met at Michael Glennâ€™s home.&nbsp; Shortly after arriving at Glennâ€™s home, petitioner left and brought Ward back to the party.&nbsp; Subsequently, petitioner and Ward left the party and drove to the apartment of one of Wardâ€™s co-workers.\r\nAfter petitioner and Ward left the party, Page acted violently and was forcefully removed from the house.&nbsp; Once he calmed down outside, Page asked if he could reenter the residence and use the phone to secure a ride home.&nbsp; Once inside, Page telephoned petitioner and informed him of the previous altercation.&nbsp; Petitioner and Ward returned to the party at the Glenn residence approximately ten minutes after petitioner spoke with Page.\r\nUpon arriving at the Glenn residence, petitioner physically attacked at least four people, including breaking one personâ€™s nose by head-butting him.Â  Petitioner demanded to see the two men who had thrown Page out of Glennâ€™s house.&nbsp; He asked the men why they attacked Page and threatened to beat them up for attacking Page.&nbsp; After questioning them, petitioner turned his anger upon Page for misleading him.Â  Petitioner beat Page, who was crying and trying to cover his face.\r\nAt this point, Ward, who had been sitting quietly at the kitchen table, confronted petitioner about his behavior.&nbsp; A guest at the party testified Ward stated: Â â€œWhy are you messing with these kids, man? Â They are scared of you.&nbsp; They donâ€™t want to fight you.â€&nbsp; Petitioner then directed his anger toward Ward, who calmly refused to fight petitioner despite several minutes of attempted instigation and taunting.&nbsp; Ward eventually responded to petitionerâ€™s threats by quickly punching him a few times and pinning him to the floor.&nbsp; After petitioner agreed to calm down, Ward allowed him to stand up, but the threats continued.\r\nAround 5:30 a.m., Ward agreed to leave the party with petitioner, despite another party guest warning Ward not to leave with petitioner.Â  Before leaving, petitioner stated, â€œYou will see this in the newspaper tomorrow.â€\r\nAround 6:30 a.m., residents of an area close to the Boozer Shopping Center heard gunshots.Â  Wardâ€™s body was later found behind the shopping center, with four bullet wounds to the head and one to the neck.Â  The wounds were caused by .38 caliber copper-jacketed bullets.Â  Markings on the recovered bullets were consistent with bullets fired from a .38 caliber handgun manufactured by the Taurus Company, as well as seven other manufacturers.Â  The murder weapon was never recovered.\r\nPetitioner arrived at his parentsâ€™ home around 8:30 a.m. on Sunday morning and entered his brotherâ€™s bedroom.Â  Petitioner confessed to his brother that he had shot Ward several times and that he did not feel remorse.Â  He told his brother to watch the news because the murder would be on the news.\r\nAround 9:00 a.m., petitioner walked over to his cousinâ€™s house.Â  The cousin testified petitioner, who was drunk, told him he had gone to a party and beat up several people.Â  Petitioner also told him he killed someone, explaining that he lured the victim behind the jewelry store he had once robbed under the guise of showing the victim how he broke into the store.Â  He told his cousin he might see it in the newspaper.\r\nDems Jewelry Store, in the Boozer Shopping Center, reported a break-in and a resulting loss of 34 womenâ€™s Tag Heuer watches in July of 2000.Â  Steven Livingston, the owner and manager of the jewelry store, testified as to the details of the break-in.Â  Page and petitionerâ€™s cousin stated that petitioner had previously told them that he had robbed a jewelry store and had taken several watches.Â  Another witness, Dustin Johnson, testified that upon petitionerâ€™s directions he had pawned twelve Tag Heuer watches.\r\nThe weapon that killed Ward was never found.Â  However, in investigating petitionerâ€™s connection to Wardâ€™s death, officers linked petitioner and five men to a residential burglary in Lexington County.Â  All five of the men testified at trial as to the details of the burglary, and the testimonies of all five men were essentially in accordance with one another.Â  The solicitor also presented testimony from Kevin Collins, the detective with the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department who investigated the robbery, and from the resident, Ronnie Muller.Â  The purpose of the testimony was to place the alleged murder weapon in the hands of petitioner around the time of the murder.\r\nTestimony revealed petitioner planned the burglary which took place on January 26, 2001.Â  Petitioner obtained a map of the inside of the home and copied keys that allowed entry to the home.[1]Â  Petitioner recruited the five men to actually enter the house for him.Â  While the five men entered the home, petitioner waited at a nearby gas station.Â  A five shot Taurus .38 caliber revolver was one of the items taken from the home.\r\nThe men met petitioner following the burglary.Â  Petitioner was furious at the groupâ€™s failure to steal any items of value.Â  However, Page testified petitioner was enthusiastic about the theft of the gun, which he placed in his car, stating he intended to use it to â€œdo some dirt.â€Â  One participant, Jessie Boot, testified the gun was a black revolver with a brown handle.Â  Another participant, David Grice, testified the gun was a brown-handled, black metal .38 that said Taurus on it.Â  Petitioner, along with a few of the men, then returned to the home to steal additional items, some of which were taken to a wooded area near petitionerâ€™s parentsâ€™ home.Â  Several of the men testified they saw petitioner place the gun in a brown paper bag and place it inside his car.\r\n \r\nThe following day, petitioner contacted an associate in the music industry to purchase bullets for the gun, but the man refused.Â  Thereafter, Dustin Johnson reluctantly agreed to purchase the bullets from a local Wal-Mart.Â  Both Johnson and petitioner were identified on store security video purchasing the bullets on January 27.\r\nPrior to the start of the trial, defense counsel moved to have evidence of the two burglaries excluded under Rules 403 and 404(b), SCRE, and under State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  The trial judge ruled evidence of the burglaries was admissible.Â  Before the residential burglary testimony began, the trial judge issued a limiting instruction to the jury that they could consider the evidence for intent and identity, but not as a comment on petitionerâ€™s character.Â  At the close of the Stateâ€™s evidence, defense counselâ€™s motion for a mistrial based on the prior bad act evidence regarding the residential burglary was denied.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err by \r\n\t\t\tupholding the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit evidence of two prior \r\n\t\t\tburglaries committed by petitioner?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err by \r\n\t\t\tupholding the trial courtâ€™s decision not to admit evidence of a \r\n\t\t\tpolice ruse designed to coerce petitioner into confessing?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Evidence of Prior Burglaries\r\nRegarding both burglaries, the Court of Appeals held that evidence of the Dems jewelry store burglary and the residential burglary was admissible under the res gestae theory.\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals erred because neither burglary furnishes part of the context of the crime nor are they necessary for a full presentation of the case.Â  See State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) (one of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence of other crimes arises when such evidence furnishes part of the context of the crime or is necessary to a full presentation of the case).Â  Neither burglary is needed to complete the story of the crime of murder.Â  See id. (evidence of other crimes is admissible where that evidence is needed to complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context or the res gestae).Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by finding the evidence of both burglaries was admissible as part of the res gestae of Wardâ€™s murder.Â  See, e.g., State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000) (evidence of an escortâ€™s assault and robbery is not admissible as part of the res gestae of the murder of another escort because the murder occurred nearly two days after the assault and robbery; further, the crimes were not so intertwined that one cannot be proven without mention of the other).\r\nThe Court of Appeals also found the State presented clear and convincing evidence that petitioner committed the burglaries.Â  The Court of Appeals further found the evidence was admissible as tending to establish petitionerâ€™s identity as Wardâ€™s murderer pursuant to Rule 404(b), SCRE.\r\nEvidence of other crimes is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  The evidence may, however, be admissible to show identity.Â  Id.Â  If the defendant was not convicted of the prior crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear and convincing.Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 631 S.E.2d 262 (2006).\r\nA. Evidence of Dems jewelry store burglary\r\nThe Dems burglary evidence is clear and convincing and falls into the identity exception.Â  The evidence served to show the identity of the murderer given petitionerâ€™s confession to his cousin that he lured the victim behind the jewelry store he had once robbed and given that Wardâ€™s body was found in the vicinity of the Dems store. Â Consequently, evidence regarding the Dems burglary was relevant and probative on the issue of identity.Â  See, e.g., State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364 (1990) (by his own actions, Bell linked the two murders together and consequently the evidence of the taped telephone conversations between Bell and the victimâ€™s family was probative of his conduct).Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough the evidence is admissible to show identity, it must also be determined whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE (although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice). Â The determination of the prejudicial effect of the evidence must be based on the entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case. Â State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881 (1990).\r\nThe amount of evidence regarding the specifics of the Dems burglary was unnecessary.Â  We find, however, that the admission of the evidence was harmless given that petitionerâ€™s guilt has been proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  See State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989) (insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached); see also State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991) (appellate courts will generally not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result).\r\nOther competent evidence established petitionerâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  There was ample testimony regarding petitionerâ€™s altercation with Ward and his veiled threat towards Ward only hours before the murder.Â  The evidence also showed that petitioner was the last one seen with Ward immediately prior to the murder and that he confessed the murder to his brother and cousin.Â  Therefore, although the quantity of testimony about the Dems burglary was inappropriate, any error in allowing the evidence was harmless.\r\nB. Evidence of the residential burglary\r\nEvidence that petitioner was involved in the residential burglary was clear and convincing.Â  Several witnesses were able to testify to his involvement.Â  Further, petitioner conceded the evidence was clear and convincing.\r\nThe burglary evidence was presented in an effort to show the identity of the perpetrator by showing that petitioner was in possession of a stolen gun that was consistent with the type of weapon used to kill the victim.Â  The evidence showed petitioner placed the stolen .38 caliber Taurus five-shot revolver in his car and later purchased .38 caliber bullets.Â  Other evidence showed that the victim had been shot five times and that the recovered bullets were consistent with those fired by a Taurus revolver.Â  Accordingly, the evidence was properly admissible to show identity.Â  See State v. Southerland, 316 S.C. 377, 447 S.E.2d 862 (1994)[2] (evidence that Southerland stole the shotgun used to kill the victim from a trailer two weeks before the murder and that he traded the shotgun for drugs the day after the murder was admissible to prove identity).\r\nHowever, even if prior bad act evidence is clear and convincing and falls within an exception, it must be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Pagan, supra.Â  Proving the identity of petitioner as the perpetrator was an important issue in the trial.Â  Allowing the State to present evidence of the burglary in an effort to show the alleged murder weapon was in petitionerâ€™s hands immediately prior to the murder was highly probative.\r\nWe find, however, that the trial court should have limited the quantity of the evidence presented about the burglary.Â  Not all of the evidence was necessary.Â  For example, one of the Stateâ€™s witnesses, Dustin Johnson, testified about the burglary but did not testify that he saw a gun stolen from the house or that petitioner had the gun around the time of the burglary.Â  Another witness, Brandon Cannon, did not give a description of the gun.Â  Accordingly, the State did not need Cannonâ€™s or Johnsonâ€™s testimony about the burglary in their effort to show petitioner was in possession of the type of gun that was used in the murder.\r\nFurther, there was an extensive amount of evidence presented about the burglary that was unrelated to the gun; for instance:Â  what other items were stolen, where other stolen items were discarded, the fact petitioner led the others in committing the burglary, and the fact petitioner ransacked the house after learning the others did not find money on their first visit.Â  Considering the volume of the testimony about the residential burglary, petitioner was prejudiced by the admission of that amount of extraneous testimony.\r\nHowever, we conclude the admission of the extraneous evidence was harmless given that petitionerâ€™s guilt has been proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  See State v. Bailey, supra.Â  Although the trial court erroneously allowed the State to provide extraneous testimony about the burglary, other competent evidence, as previously discussed, established petitionerâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Therefore, the courtâ€™s error in allowing the extraneous burglary evidence was harmless.Â  See State v. Bailey, supra; State v. Sherard, supra.\r\nII. Evidence of the police ruse\r\nAt trial, defense counsel was not allowed to elicit testimony from Lieutenant Smith about a ruse the police used in an attempt to convince petitioner to confess to the crime.Â  In testimony proffered outside the juryâ€™s presence, Smith admitted police falsified aerial photographs to show petitionerâ€™s vehicle at the rear of the Boozer Shopping Center around the time of the shooting.Â  The ruse was used in an interview with petitioner to obtain a confession; however, petitioner did not confess.\r\nDefense counsel also attempted to show during the proffered testimony that Smith omitted details of the ruse from his report on the investigation.Â  Defense counsel argued this information should have been presented to the jury both to show the lack of confidence the police had in their case and the possible lack of integrity in the investigation based on lack of documentation of the ruse.Â  The trial judge ruled evidence of the ruse was not relevant because there was no other indication the State had manufactured other evidence or done anything else improper.Â  The judge further ruled that the admission of the evidence would confuse the jury because there were no â€œfruitsâ€ obtained from the ruse.Â  The Court of Appeals found the trial judge did not err by refusing to admit the evidence.\r\nEvidence is relevant if it tends to make more or less probable a fact in issue.Â  Rule 401, SCRE; State v. Huggins, 336 S.C. 200, 519 S.E.2d 574 (1999).[3]Â  Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The relevancy of evidence is an issue within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion.Â  State v. Huggins, supra.\r\nThere is no abuse of discretion here.Â  Evidence that the ruse failed to elicit a confession is not relevant to the circumstances of Wardâ€™s death.Â  It is also not relevant because there is no suggestion by petitioner that the State manufactured any evidence or engaged in any other improprieties in investigating the case.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the trial judge properly excluded the evidence.\r\nPetitioner argues that, pursuant to Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731 (1969), and State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 972 (1996), evidence of the ruse should have been admitted so that the jury could have considered how it reflected on the strength of the Stateâ€™s case.Â  The Court of Appeals properly found that these cases are inapplicable because they involve determining whether a confession was voluntarily given after examining all the circumstances surrounding the confession.Â  Here, there is no confession and no statements for the jury to determine how they were given and if they were voluntary.\r\nAccordingly, the trial judge properly excluded testimony regarding the ruse.Â  See State v. Douglas,&nbsp;369 S.C. 424, 632 S.E.2d 845 (2006) (the admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals erred by holding evidence of the burglaries was admissible as res gestae evidence.Â  Regarding both burglaries, we find the evidence was probative to the issue of identity; however, the amount of evidence should have been limited by the trial judge.Â  Given the overwhelming evidence of guilt, however, the admission of the extraneous evidence regarding the burglaries was harmless error.Â  We further hold the trial judge properly excluded testimony regarding the ruse the police used in an effort to obtain petitionerâ€™s confession.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]There is a Walmart video showing petitioner and Page having the keys copied.\r\n[2]Cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1166 (1995).\r\n[3]Cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1172 (2000).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26344","title":"State v.

[a]t a minimal.[1]â€Â \r\n  The court denied Appellantâ€™s subsequent motion for a mistrial based on this\r\n  remark.\r\nA\r\n  jury convicted Appellant of distribution of crack cocaine, distribution of\r\n  crack cocaine within the proximity of a school,[2] possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, and possession of crack\r\n  cocaine with intent to distribute with in the proximity of a school.Â  The trial\r\n  court sentenced Appellant to consecutive sentences of fifteen years and five\r\n  years for the distribution charges, and concurrent sentences of fifteen years\r\n  and ten years on the possession charges.Â Â This appeal followed.\r\nThis\r\n  case was certified to this Court from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule\r\n  204(b), SCACR.Â  Appellant raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court err in\r\n  admitting drug evidence obtained from the informant because the chain of\r\n  custody was defective?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in failing\r\n  to direct a mistrial after commenting in the presence of the jury that the\r\n  State had established by &ldquo;circumstantial evidence at a minimum&rdquo; that Appellant\r\n  sold the drugs being offered into evidence?\r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nDecisions\r\n  regarding the admissibility of evidence and whether to grant or deny a mistrial\r\n  are within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006); State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33, 615 S.E.2d\r\n  455, 460 (2005).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the\r\n  trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of\r\n  law.Â  Pagan, 369 S.C. at 208, 631 S.E.2d at 265.\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chain of custody\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of drugs purchased by\r\n  an unknown confidential informant because the chain of custody was defective.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nAs a\r\n  preliminary matter, the State argues that this issue is not preserved for\r\n  appeal because Appellant did not renew his objection to this evidence at the\r\n  time the evidence was introduced.Â  To properly preserve an issue for review there\r\n  must be a contemporaneous\r\n  objection that is ruled upon by the trial courtÂ  State v.\r\n    Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the State sought to admit two pieces of drug evidence at trial:Â  the\r\n  drugs that the informant allegedly purchased from Appellant and turned over to\r\n  the police upon arriving back at the station (Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 2); and the\r\n  drugs which police seized from Appellant incident to his arrest in the motel parking\r\n  lot (Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 1).Â  The Stateâ€™s first attempt to admit drug evidence\r\n  came during the testimony of the officer who received the drugs from the\r\n  informant back at the police station.Â  When the State moved to admit these\r\n  drugs, i.e., Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 2, defense counsel objected on the grounds\r\n  that the State had not revealed an adequate chain of custody to satisfy\r\n  admissibility requirements.Â  Based on the defective chain of custody, the trial\r\n  court declined to admit the drugs at that time.Â  \r\nLater\r\n  in the trial, the State attempted to simultaneously admit both Stateâ€™s Exhibit\r\n  No. 1 (the drugs found on Appellant after his arrest) and Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 2\r\n  (the drugs received from the confidential informant) during the testimony of the\r\n  forensic chemist.Â  At this point, defense counsel objected to the admissibility\r\n  of Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 1 on the grounds that the State failed to establish an\r\n  adequate chain of custody.Â  Specifically, defense counsel stated, â€œ[T]here is\r\n  no evidence that this is attributed to the defendant or came in from any\r\n  source.Â  The officer claims, you know, he got it from somewhere.Â  And that\r\n  thereâ€™s no connection between the defendant and this substance.â€Â  The State now\r\n  argues that defense counselâ€™s failure to specifically object to Stateâ€™s Exhibit\r\n  No. 2 prevents Appellant from raising the issue to this Court.\r\nWe\r\n  find that Appellantâ€™s failure to renew his objection to Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 2\r\n  does not amount to a failure to preserve the issue.Â  The grounds for defense\r\n  counselâ€™s objection to Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 1 clearly refer to the absence of\r\n  testimony from the informant with respect to Stateâ€™s Exhibit No. 2, the drugs\r\n  received from the informant.Â  Conversely, the drugs marked as Stateâ€™s Exhibit\r\n  No. 1 were retrieved directly from Appellantâ€™s front pocket incident to arrest\r\n  and an objection to their admissibility based on a gap in the chain of custody would\r\n  have been nonsensical.Â  Because Appellantâ€™s objection clearly refers to the\r\n  drugs received from the confidential informant, Appellant should not be\r\n  penalized for an apparent misstatement in referring to the exhibit number of\r\n  the objectionable evidence.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76,\r\n  497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œ[A]n objection must be sufficiently specific to\r\n  inform the trial court of the point being urged by the objector.â€).Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find that the issue has been properly preserved for appeal.\r\nTurning\r\n  to the merits, this Court has long held that a party offering into evidence\r\n  fungible items such as drugs or blood samples must establish a complete chain\r\n  of custody as far as practicable.Â  Benton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. 26,\r\n  33, 100 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1957).Â  Where an analyzed substance that has passed\r\n  through several hands, the identity of individuals who acquired the evidence\r\n  and what was done with the evidence between the taking and the analysis must\r\n  not be left to conjecture.Â  Id. at 33-34, 100 S.E.2d at 537.Â \r\n  Accordingly, if the identity of each person handling the evidence is\r\n  established, and the manner of handling is reasonably demonstrated, no abuse of\r\n  discretion by the trial court is shown in admitting the evidence absent proof\r\n  of tampering, bad faith, or ill-motive.Â  State v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18,\r\n  25, 598 S.E.2d 735, 738 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nTestimony\r\n  from each custodian of fungible evidence, however, is not a prerequisite to\r\n  establishing a chain of custody sufficient for admissibility.Â  Id. at 27, 598 S.E.2d at 739. Â Where other evidence establishes the\r\n  identity of those who have handled the evidence and reasonably demonstrates the\r\n  manner of handling of the evidence, our courts have been willing to fill gaps\r\n  in the chain of custody due to an absent witness.Â  See State v. Williams, 297 S.C. 290, 376 S.E.2d 773 (1989) (upholding the admissibility\r\n  of a blood test even though a nurse who drew the blood from the defendant did\r\n  not testify at trial; hospital forms completed by the absent nurse and\r\n  testimony from the other evidence custodians sufficiently established a chain\r\n  of custody).\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, we find that without the testimony of the confidential\r\n  informant, the Stateâ€™s proof fails to establish a complete chain of custody.Â  None\r\n  of the chain of custody witnesses testified to seeing inside the motel room in\r\n  order to establish who was in the room making the alleged transaction.Â  Additionally,\r\n  none of the witnesses who heard only â€œone other voiceâ€ over the informantâ€™s\r\n  body wire could affirmatively identify this voice as being that of Appellant.Â \r\n  Although Greenville police officers testified to a brief search of the informant\r\n  both before and after the incident, and that they observed no other individuals\r\n  enter or exit the room during their surveillance, this circumstantial evidence\r\n  does not show how the informant came into possession of the drug evidence and\r\n  in what condition he received it.Â  See State v. Chisolm, 355 S.C.\r\n  175, 584 S.E.2d 401 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding that the names and signatures of\r\n  two evidence technicians on the evidence bag did not sufficiently prove chain\r\n  of custody where the two technicians were not present at trial to testify to\r\n  receiving the evidence).Â  Because the officersâ€™ testimony does not fill the gap\r\n  in the chain of custody left by the unavailable informant, the trial court\r\n  erred in admitting the drug evidence received by the confidential informant.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the officersâ€™ knowledge of the confidential informantâ€™s name\r\n  establishes his identity and therefore, the issue in this case is merely a\r\n  question of the credibility of the drug evidence rather than its admissibility.Â \r\n  This argument is based on the longstanding rule that proof of the chain of\r\n  custody need not negate all possibility of tampering so long as the party\r\n  seeking to admit the evidence has established a complete chain of custody at\r\n  least as far as practicable.Â  Benton, 232 S.C. at 33, 100 S.E.2d at\r\n  537.Â Â  In applying this rule, this Court has held that where a party has\r\n  established the identity of each person in the chain of custody, issues\r\n  regarding the care of the evidence only go to the weight of the specimen as credible\r\n  evidence, and not its admissibility.Â  State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419,\r\n  424, 544 S.E.2d 835, 837 (2001).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find that the Stateâ€™s argument is misapplied in the instant case.Â  The rules\r\n  upon which the State relies require the State in the first instance to have\r\n  established a complete chain of custody at least as far a practicable.Â  As\r\n  discussed above, in the absence of testimony from the confidential informant,\r\n  the Stateâ€™s proof of chain of custody is incomplete because it fails to establish\r\n  the identity of each custodian and the manner of handling of the evidence.Â  Cf.\r\n    id. (holding that where all custodians of a blood sample testified, the\r\n  chain of custody was complete and therefore, evidence regarding a discrepancy\r\n  in the handling of the blood sample went to the weight of the sample as\r\n  credible evidence and not its admissibility).Â  Furthermore, although the\r\n  unavailability of the confidential informant made it impracticable to produce\r\n  him as a witness at trial, the State could have taken a sworn statement from\r\n  the informant before he left the station and produced the statement at trial\r\n  under the procedures of Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP.[3]Â  See Chisolm, 355 S.C. at 180, 584 S.E.2d at 404 (finding drug evidence\r\n  inadmissible where â€œit would not have been impracticable for the State to have\r\n  called each custodian to testify or for the State to have submitted sworn\r\n  statements from the custodians under . . . Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP.â€).Â  In other\r\n  words, the State simply did not present proof of the chain of custody as far as\r\n  practicable.Â  For these reasons, the informantâ€™s possession of the drug\r\n  evidence may not be reduced to an issue of mere credibility based solely on the\r\n  officersâ€™ knowledge of the informantâ€™s name.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  our courts have been willing to fill in gaps in the chain of custody where\r\n  other evidence reasonably demonstrates the identity of each individual in the\r\n  chain of custody and the manner of handling of the evidence, such circumstances\r\n  are not present here.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting\r\n  evidence of drugs allegedly purchased from Appellant by the informant.\r\n  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remark by the trial court\r\n  in the presence of the jury.\r\nBecause\r\n  our decision regarding the chain of custody is dispositive in this case, we\r\n  decline to address Appellantâ€™s argument that the trial court erred in refusing\r\n  to grant a mistrial based on the courtâ€™s remark that the State had established by\r\n  â€œcircumstantial evidence at a minimumâ€ that the drugs came from Appellant.Â  See\r\n    Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (providing that an appellate court need not address additional\r\n  issues if the resolution of another issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  reverse Appellantâ€™s distribution convictions and remand the case for a new\r\n  trial on these charges.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] Neither party disputes that from the context of this remark, the word â€œminimumâ€\r\n  was the appropriate/intended usage.\r\n[2] The drug transaction took place at a motel that was within one-half mile of Bob Jones University.\r\n[3] Rule 6(b), SCRCrimP, allows for the admission of sworn statements to prove\r\n  chain of custody in lieu of the appearance of a chain of custody witness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of John Plyler Mann, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2007-06-06-01","description":"","date":"2007-06-12","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of \r\n  John Plyler Mann, Jr., \tPetitioner.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On October 24, 2003, petitioner was placed on interim suspension.

In addition, the Court held dismissal of the charge was a proper remedy pursuant to the statute.","date":"2007-06-18","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        The City of Rock Hill, Appellant,\r\n        v.\r\n        Cynthia A.

McDow, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE\r\n  MANNING:Â  This is an appeal from the Rock Hill municipal court.Â  Cynthia Suchenski (respondent) was found guilty of driving\r\n  with an unlawful alcohol concentration (DUAC), and the circuit court reversed\r\n  her conviction based on the City of Rock Hillâ€™s (Cityâ€™s) failure to comply with\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953 (2006), which requires the arresting officer to\r\n  provide videotaping of the incident site.Â  We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) and was later charged with\r\n  DUAC.Â  At the incident site, the arresting officer did not videotape the entire\r\n  arrest as required by Â§ 56-5-2953 because the officerâ€™s camera ran out of\r\n  tape.Â  The videotaping began upon activation of the officerâ€™s blue lights and\r\n  recorded two field sobriety tests and the Miranda warnings, but the tape\r\n  stopped before the officer administered a third field sobriety test and before\r\n  respondent was arrested.\r\nAt trial,\r\n  respondent moved to dismiss the charges due to the officerâ€™s failure to provide\r\n  a complete videotape from the incident site.Â  The officer testified that a tape\r\n  had never ended during an arrest before and that he turned on his blue lights\r\n  and assumed the videotape was running as usual.Â  The officer stated he did not\r\n  know the tape was about to expire.Â  The municipal court denied the motion pursuant\r\n  to the statute on the grounds of exigent circumstances.Â  The municipal court\r\n  also cited State v. Huntley, 349 S.C. 1, 562 S.E.2d 472 (2002), and State\r\n    v. Mabe, 306 S.C. 355, 412 S.E.2d 386 (1991), in support of its denial of respondentâ€™s\r\n  motion to dismiss.\r\nThe case was tried\r\n  before a jury, and respondent was found guilty.Â  Respondent appealed her\r\n  conviction, and the circuit court reversed, holding that respondentâ€™s motion to\r\n  dismiss should have been granted.Â  The circuit court distinguished Huntley and Mabe, the two cases relied upon by the municipal court in denying\r\n  respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  However, the circuit court did not address the\r\n  finding of the municipal court that exigent circumstances excused compliance\r\n  with the statute and simply held that the City violated the videotaping\r\n  statute.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the circuit court err in reversing respondentâ€™s conviction and dismissing the\r\n  DUAC charge?\r\n  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn\r\n  criminal appeals from municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de\r\n  novo review.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-105 (Supp. 2006); State v. Landis,\r\n  362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In criminal cases, the appellate\r\n  court reviews errors of law only.Â  State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 199\r\n  S.E.2d 61 (1973).Â  Therefore, our scope of review is limited to correcting the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order for errors of law.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  City first argues that the circuit court erred by determining the City violated\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953.Â  This issue is not preserved.\r\nSection 56-5-2953\r\n  commands the arresting officer to videotape the individual during a DUI\r\n  arrest.Â  Subsection (A) of the statute outlines the requirements for\r\n  videotaping at the incident site and at the breath test site. Subsection (B) of\r\n  the statute provides exceptions that excuse compliance with the statute.[1]Â \r\n  In this case, both parties agreed that the arresting officer failed to comply\r\n  with the requirements of subsection (A), but the municipal court denied\r\n  respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss due to an exception in subsection (B).Â  \r\nOn appeal to the\r\n  circuit court, the City reiterated its position that noncompliance was excused\r\n  pursuant to Â§ 56-5-2953(B).Â  However, the circuit courtâ€™s order did not address\r\n  or even mention the exceptions in subsection (B).Â  The circuit court simply\r\n  concluded, â€œHere, the legislature has established a procedure that must be followed in the making of a DUI arrest.Â  Here, the procedure was not\r\n  followed.â€Â  While the circuit court correctly applied subsection (A) of the\r\n  statute, it omitted any mention of subsection (B) of Â§ 56-5-2953.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  City did not seek a post-judgment ruling from the circuit court on the\r\n  potential applicability of Â§ 56-5-2953(B).Â  This precludes our review of the\r\n  applicability of the subsection (B) exceptions, as we may only review the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order for errors of law.Â  We cannot determine error regarding\r\n  an issue not addressed by the circuit court.Â  See Williams v.\r\n    Williams, 329 S.C. 569, 579, 496 S.E.2d 23, 29 (Ct. App. 1998), revâ€™d on\r\n      other grounds, 335 S.C. 386, 517 S.E.2d 689 (1999) (â€œThe circuit court has\r\n  the authority to hear motions to alter or amend the judgment when it sits in an\r\n  appellate capacity, and these motions are required in order to preserve issues\r\n  for further review by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court in cases where\r\n  the circuit court fails to address an issue raised by a party.â€); United\r\n    Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 413\r\n  S.E.2d 866 (Ct. App. 1992) (circuit court sitting on appeal did not address an\r\n  issue and Wal-Mart made no motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to have the\r\n  court rule on the issue; thus the allegation was not preserved for further\r\n  review by the Court of Appeals).\r\nThe City next\r\n  contends that, per Huntley, a violation of the videotaping statute\r\n  should not result in dismissal of a charge when there was no showing of\r\n  prejudice to the defendant.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder Â§ 56-5-2953, a violation of the statute, with no\r\n  mention of prejudice, may result in dismissal of the charges.Â  The statute\r\n  provides, â€œFailure by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes required\r\n  by this section is not alone a ground for dismissal of any charge made\r\n  pursuant to Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945 if [exceptions\r\n  apply]â€¦â€ (emphasis added).Â  Conversely, failure to produce videotapes would be\r\n  a ground for dismissal if no exceptions apply.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found Huntley to be inapposite, and we agree. The statute\r\n  at issue in Huntley was the implied consent statute which required a\r\n  simulator test before administration of a breath test.Â  That statute, S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (2006), is silent as to the remedy for noncompliance, whereas\r\n  the statute in this case provides for dismissal of charges when the statute is\r\n  inexcusably violated.\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  City failed to seek a ruling in the circuit court in regards to the\r\n  applicability of the exceptions for noncompliance found in Â§ 56-5-2953(B).Â \r\n  Accordingly, that issue is not properly before us.Â  Finally, dismissal of the DUAC\r\n  charge is an appropriate remedy provided by Â§ 56-5-2953 where a violation of\r\n  subsection (A) is not mitigated by subsection (B) exceptions.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, ACJ, WALLER,\r\n  J., and Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., concur.Â  BURNETT, J., dissenting\r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\n  \r\nBURNETT, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the issue of\r\n  whether the circuit erred by determining the City violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-2953 is preserved.\r\n In order to\r\n  preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must file a motion to alter or\r\n  amend the judgment when the party raises an issue to the lower court and the\r\n  court fails to rule upon the issue.Â  E.g., Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004); Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.\r\n    Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000); see also Rules 52(b) and 59(e), SCRCP.Â  However, a motion to alter or amend the judgment\r\n  under Rule 59(e) was not necessary in this case.Â  Appellantâ€™s failure to move\r\n  to seek a ruling from the lower court on the applicability of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-2953(B) (2006) does not violate the long-established preservation\r\n  requirements.Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  parties argued the applicability of subsections (A) and (B) extensively in\r\n  their briefs and at the hearing before the lower court.Â  The lower courtâ€™s\r\n  determination hinged on whether subsection (B) provided an excuse for the\r\n  violation of subsection (A).Â  The lower court determined no exception in\r\n  subsection (B) applied.Â  Although the lower courtâ€™s order only addressed\r\n  subsection (A), the fact that subsection (B) did not apply was implicit in the\r\n  order and, therefore, preserved for review.Â  \r\nA\r\n  preservation issue did not arise when the lower court implicitly ruled in the\r\n  negative that no exception applied, as opposed to alternatively ruling in the\r\n  positive that an exception applied.Â  For preservation purposes, it was\r\n  unnecessary for the lower court to rule upon an exception when no such\r\n  exception applied.Â  Hence, despite the fact the entire opinion addressed only\r\n  subsection (A), Appellant was free to argue on appeal an exception in\r\n  subsection (B) applied. \r\nSection\r\n  56-5-2953(B), states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Failure\r\n    by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is\r\n    not alone a ground for dismissal of any charge made pursuant to Section\r\n    56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945 if the arresting officer submits a sworn\r\n    affidavit certifying that the videotape equipment at the time of the arrest â€¦\r\n    was in an inoperable condition, â€¦ or in the alternative â€¦ it was physically\r\n    impossible to produce the videotape because the person needed emergency medical\r\n    treatment, or exigent circumstances existed.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  In the\r\n  instant case, the videotape began upon activation of the officerâ€™s blue lights\r\n  and recorded two field sobriety tests and the Miranda warnings.Â  The\r\n  tape stopped before the officer administered a third field sobriety test and a\r\n  â€œwalk and turnâ€ test, and before Respondent was arrested.Â  The officer\r\n  testified he assumed the videotape was running as usual and did not know the\r\n  tape had expired prematurely.Â  The municipal court correctly denied\r\n  Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss based on the â€œexigent circumstancesâ€ exception\r\n  in subsection (B).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  it was unnecessary for Appellant to make a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), the\r\n  issue of whether subsection (B) applied is preserved for review.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  I would reverse the lower court and reinstate the decision of the municipal\r\n  court.Â \r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] Respondent argues the applicable statutory provision\r\n  states, â€œNothing in this section prohibits the court from considering any other\r\n  valid reason for the failure to produce the videotape based upon the totality\r\n  of the circumstances.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26346 ","title":"Reed v.

Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998), cert. denied 525 U.S. 1150, 119 S.Ct. 1051, 143 L.Ed.2d 57 (1999).\r\nPetitioner filed\r\n  an application for PCR, which was denied after an evidentiary hearing.Â  He then\r\n  filed a Notice of Appeal.Â  However, prior to the filing of a petition for writ\r\n  of certiorari, Petitioner wrote a\r\n  letter to Chief Justice Toal professing his innocence, claiming to waive his\r\n  right to all appeals, and asking that a date for his execution be set.Â  We remanded Petitionerâ€™s case to the circuit\r\n  court for a competency hearing. \r\nA competency\r\n  hearing was held on February 10, 2006, before Judge A. Victor Rawl.Â  Judge Rawl\r\n  received testimony from Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, Dr. Pratap Narayan, and\r\n  Petitioner.Â  He also received into evidence a forensic evaluation by the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Mental Health among other documents.Â  In an order dated\r\n  March 30, 2006, Judge Rawl found Petitioner competent under the Singleton v.\r\n    State[2] standard to waive appellate review of the order denying his PCR application.Â  He\r\n  also determined Petitionerâ€™s decision was knowing and voluntary.Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  subsequently wrote a letter to Respondentâ€™s counsel stating he had fired his\r\n  attorney and asking for assistance.Â  We construed the letter to be a motion to\r\n  relieve counsel and we deferred ruling on the motion until we issued this\r\n  opinion.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court err in\r\n  finding Petitioner is competent to  waive appellate review of the denial\r\n  of his PCR application and  in finding his decision is knowing,\r\n  intelligent, and voluntary? \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Should this Court grant\r\n  Petitioner&rsquo;s motion to relieve counsel and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proceed pro se?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis Court is\r\n  charged with the responsibility of issuing a notice authorizing the execution\r\n  of a person who has been duly convicted in a court of law and sentenced to\r\n  death.Â  The Court will issue an execution notice after that person either has\r\n  exhausted all appeals and other avenues of PCR in state and federal courts, or\r\n  after that person, who is determined by this Court to be mentally competent,\r\n  knowingly and voluntarily waives such appeals.Â  See In re Stays of\r\n    Execution in Capital Cases, 321 S.C. 544, 471 S.E.2d 140 (1996); Roberts\r\n      v. Moore, 332 S.C. 488, 505 S.E.2d 593 (1998); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-25,\r\n  17-25-370 (2003).Â  \r\nWhen considering a\r\n  request by a convicted capital defendant to waive the right to appeal or pursue\r\n  PCR, and to be executed forthwith, we must determine whether the defendant is\r\n  competent and whether the decision is knowing and voluntary.Â  See Hughes\r\n    v. State, 367 S.C. 389, 395, 626 S.E.2d 805, 808 (2006) (Court will issue\r\n  an execution notice if the person, who is determined by the Court to be\r\n  mentally competent, knowingly and voluntarily waives appeals and PCR); State\r\n    v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 46, 451 S.E.2d 883, 883 (1994) (Torrence II)\r\n  (waiver may not be found unless Court first determines defendant is competent\r\n  and his decision is knowing and voluntary).Â  In making a determination on the\r\n  competency of a convicted capital defendant to waive his appellate or PCR\r\n  rights, we are not bound by the circuit courtâ€™s findings or rulings, although we recognize the circuit court judge, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony. Â Hughes, 367 S.C. at 395,\r\n  626 S.E.2d at 808.Â  This matter is similar to one arising\r\n  in the Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction because it is this Court which must\r\n  finally determine whether a particular capital defendant is mentally competent\r\n  to make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his appellate or PCR rights.Â  Id. at 395-96, 626 S.E.2d at 808. Â In deciding the\r\n  issue of a capital defendantâ€™s competency, we carefully and thoroughly review the\r\n  defendantâ€™s history of mental competency; the existence and present status of\r\n  mental illness or disease suffered by the defendant, if any, as shown in the\r\n  record of previous proceedings and in the competency hearing; the testimony and\r\n  opinions of mental health experts who have examined the defendant; the findings\r\n  of the circuit court which conducted a competency hearing; the arguments of\r\n  counsel; and the capital defendantâ€™s demeanor and personal responses to the\r\n  Courtâ€™s questions at oral argument regarding the waiver of\r\n  appellate or PCR rights.Â  Id. at 396-97, 626 S.E.2d at 808-09.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Waiver of Right to Appeal\r\nA.Â  Mental Competency\r\nThe standard for\r\n  determining whether a convicted capital defendant is mentally competent to\r\n  waive the right to a direct appeal or PCR is set forth in Singleton:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    first prong is the cognitive prong which can be defined as:Â  whether a\r\n    convicted defendant can understand the nature of the proceedings, what he or\r\n    she was tried for, the reason for the punishment, or the nature of the\r\n    punishment.Â  The second prong is the assistance prong which can be defined as:Â \r\n    whether the convicted defendant possesses sufficient capacity or ability to\r\n    rationally communicate with counsel.\r\n\r\n313 S.C. at 84, 437 S.E.2d at\r\n  58; accord Torrence II, 317 S.C. at 47, 451 S.E.2d at 884.Â  This\r\n  standard of competency is the same one required before a convicted defendant\r\n  may be executed.Â  Torrence II, 317 S.C. at 47, 451 S.E.2d at 884.Â  The\r\n  failure of either prong is sufficient to warrant a stay of execution and a\r\n  denial of the convicted defendantâ€™s motion to waive his right to appeal or\r\n  pursue PCR.Â  Singleton, 313 S.C. at 84, 437 S.E.2d at 58.Â  \r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts,\r\n  an expert in forensic psychiatry, testified at the competency hearing that Petitioner\r\n  has traits of paranoia.Â  She opined Petitionerâ€™s suspicious attitude toward his\r\n  attorneys and their motives in representing him was indicative of his\r\n  paranoia.Â  She also diagnosed Petitioner with schizotypal personality disorder and\r\n  testified he has borderline intellectual functioning.Â  Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified\r\n  although Petitioner can lose contact with reality when under stress, he does\r\n  not currently have any psychotic symptoms and his mental state has not\r\n  deteriorated from 2001 to 2006.Â  \r\nDr. Pratap Narayan,\r\n  the court-appointed expert in forensic psychiatry, also testified at the\r\n  competency hearing.Â  Dr. Narayan provisionally diagnosed Petitioner with\r\n  adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct.Â  He\r\n  testified Petitioner does not have a psychotic illness and did not exhibit\r\n  signs of any major mental illness.Â  \r\nDrs. Schwartz-Watts\r\n  and Narayan also testified Petitioner met the Singleton standard.Â  They\r\n  testified Petitioner understands the nature of the current proceedings, what he\r\n  was tried for, the nature of his punishment, and the reasons for the\r\n  punishment.Â  They also testified he has the capacity and ability to communicate\r\n  and assist counsel.\r\nAt the competency\r\n  hearing, Petitioner presented Judge Rawl with a pro se motion, captioned\r\n  â€œStand 3 Motion.â€Â  In this motion, Petitioner requested the court â€œdismiss the\r\n  case or kill me.â€Â  Petitioner testified he understood the hearing before Judge\r\n  Rawl was to determine his competency, but he intended to fight for his\r\n  innocence, integrity, and dignity at the hearing.Â  Petitioner further testified\r\n  he understood the nature of the proceedings, what he was tried for, the reason\r\n  for the punishment, and the nature of the punishment.Â  Petitioner admitted he\r\n  had conflicts with his attorneys, but he did not have a problem communicating\r\n  with them.Â  Â  \r\nJudge Rawl found\r\n  Petitioner suffers from a personality disorder, but he is not currently\r\n  suffering from any psychotic or emotional disturbance.Â  He found Petitioner met\r\n  both prongs of the Singleton standard and is competent to waive his\r\n  right to appeal the denial of his PCR application.Â  \r\nWe extensively\r\n  questioned Petitioner during oral arguments to ascertain whether he met the Singleton criteria.Â  Although Petitioner has a personality disorder and may, at times,\r\n  have paranoid thoughts and eccentric thinking, these conditions do not affect\r\n  his capacity or ability to satisfy either the cognitive or assistance prong of\r\n  the Singleton standard.Â  Based on our own colloquy with Petitioner and\r\n  the overwhelming evidence in the record before us, we find Petitioner is\r\n  competent to waive his right to appeal the order denying his PCR application.\r\nB.Â  Knowing, Intelligent,\r\n  and Voluntary\r\nA capital defendant, who is competent, may waive his right to appeal\r\n  if the decision to do so is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.Â  Torrence\r\n    II, 317 S.C. at 46, 451 S.E.2d at 883; see also Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990); Gilmore v. Utah, 429 U.S. 1012, 97 S.Ct. 436, 50 L.Ed.2d 632 (1976).\r\nAt the competency\r\n  hearing, Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified Petitioner wants to waive any further\r\n  proceedings and proceed to execution because â€œhe does not see any other legal\r\n  avenuesâ€ in which to prove his innocence.Â  Therefore, he would rather die with\r\n  his own personal belief that he is innocent instead of staying on death row\r\n  where he believes people will presume him guilty.Â  Dr. Narayan also testified\r\n  Petitioner â€œwould much rather be executed at this point with maintaining his\r\n  dignity and his integrity . . . and his innocence.â€Â  He opined Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  desire to waive further legal proceedings was not based on a psychotic premise.Â \r\n  Petitioner testified he brought the waiver so that he could leave death row\r\n  with his innocence and integrity. Â Â \r\nJudge Rawl\r\n  determined Petitioner wanted to waive his right to appeal because Petitioner\r\n  believes he will be unsuccessful in the appellate process and although he\r\n  maintains his innocence, Petitioner would prefer to end the legal process and\r\n  maintain his dignity.Â  Judge Rawl concluded Petitionerâ€™s waiver was knowing and\r\n  voluntary.\r\nWe thoroughly\r\n  questioned Petitioner during oral arguments about his trial, the PCR process,\r\n  and the appeals process.Â  We also questioned him about the consequences of his\r\n  request to terminate any appeals from the denial of his PCR application.Â  Petitioner\r\n  alleged he wanted to waive his right to appeal, but he also requested the Court\r\n  review his pro se brief and either dismiss the case if the Court found\r\n  him innocent or set a date for execution if the Court found him guilty.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Petitioner asked the Court to review substantive claims regarding the quality\r\n  of representation he received during his trial and PCR proceeding, evidentiary\r\n  matters which he claims should have been pursued during prior proceedings, and\r\n  whether he had a right to two standby counsel during his trial.Â  \r\nWe find Petitioner\r\n  conditioned his request to waive his right to appellate review on our\r\n  determination of his innocence or guilt based on the merits of the case.[3]Â \r\n  Unlike other capital defendants who have confirmed their guilt and waived their\r\n  right to appeal, Petitionerâ€™s conditional request is not an unequivocal waiver\r\n  of the right to appeal.Â  Compare State v. Passaro, 350 S.C. 499,\r\n  507-08, 567 S.E.2d 862, 867 (2002) (capital defendant reaffirmed his request to\r\n  waive his right to appeal); State v. Torrence, 322 S.C. 475, 477-79, 473\r\n  S.E.2d 703, 705-06 (1996) (capital defendant remained steadfast in his desire\r\n  to withdraw his appeal).Â  Accordingly, Petitioner has failed to make a knowing\r\n  and intelligent waiver of his right to appeal.Â \r\n  \r\nII.Â  Motion to Relieve Counsel and Proceed Pro Se\r\nâ€œThe Sixth and\r\n  Fourteenth Amendments of our Constitution guarantee that a person brought to\r\n  trial in any state or federal court must be afforded the right to the\r\n  assistance of counsel before he can be validly convicted and punished by\r\n  imprisonment.â€ Â Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525,\r\n  2527, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 566 (1975). Â This right may be waived, and the waiver must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.Â  Id. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, 45 L.E.2d at 581; State v.

United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 242, 87 L.Ed. 268, 275 (1942). Â Â \r\n We questioned\r\n  Petitioner at length about his decision to waive his right to counsel.Â \r\n  Petitioner stated he was not satisfied with counselâ€™s representation of him\r\n  because, according to Petitioner, she presumed he was guilty and was â€œagainst\r\n  the evidence that proves his innocence.â€Â  Petitioner appeared upset that his\r\n  counsel would not â€œfight for his innocenceâ€ in accordance with his wishes.Â  We\r\n  also questioned Petitioner whether he fully understood the nature of PCR\r\n  proceedings and the appellate process following a denial of a PCR application.Â \r\n  Petitioner asked the Court to allow him to waive his right to appeal and he stated\r\n  he did not want us to review the questions raised in his PCR application.Â  Yet,\r\n  he also asked us to review the merits of his case, and he raised substantive\r\n  claims regarding his trial which he desired the Court to address.Â  Although\r\n  Petitioner is competent to waive this right, we find troubling the fact that\r\n  Petitioner clearly does not understand the procedural posture of his case.Â  For\r\n  this reason, we deny Petitionerâ€™s motion to relieve counsel at this stage of\r\n  the proceeding.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s finding that Petitioner is competent to waive his right to appellate\r\n  review of the order denying his PCR application, and we reverse the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling that Petitioner made a knowing and intelligent waiver of that\r\n  right.[5]Â \r\n  Further, we deny Petitionerâ€™s motion to relieve counsel.Â  Based on the foregoing,\r\n  the matter involving the order denying Petitionerâ€™s PCR application should no\r\n  longer be held in abeyance and the appeal shall proceed as set forth in Rule\r\n  227, SCACR.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART\r\n  AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J.

Joseph Isaacs, of Isaacs &amp; Alley, of \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tColumbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT: Â Don Allyn Ray (Appellant) brought this action to set aside the judgment of the family court pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  The family court granted Melinda Hodges Rayâ€™s (Respondent) motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We reverse.Â \r\n \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant and Respondent were divorced in 2000.Â  In 2001, the family court issued a decree approving the settlement reached by Appellant and Respondent concerning the equitable division of their marital estate.Â  In 2005, Appellant initiated the instant action, alleging an action for fraud upon the court and an independent action in equity arising from Respondentâ€™s deliberate concealment of $130,000 until after the marital property had been divided.Â \r\n \r\nPrior to the divorce, Respondent entered an agreement to sell a pharmacy she owned jointly with her husband.Â  At the same time, Respondent entered into a separate agreement not to compete with CVS, the purchaser of the pharmacy, for which she received $130,000 in consideration.Â  Respondent made arrangements with CVS to receive payment after the divorce was finalized.Â  Further, she deliberately concealed the aforementioned agreement in response to discovery requests and during depositions.Â  \r\n \r\nThe family court addressed the issue of whether Appellantâ€™s allegations against Respondent rose to the level of extrinsic fraud or were simply intrinsic fraud.Â  Respondent argued that her acts constituted only intrinsic fraud, res judicata applied, Appellant failed to exercise due diligence in discovering the fraud, and the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  Thereafter, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â \r\n \r\nThe family court, citing Chewning v. Ford Motor Company, 354 S.C. 72, 579 S.E.2d 605 (2003), held Appellantâ€™s allegations did not rise to the level of extrinsic fraud because there were no allegations of â€œextraordinary, collateral matters which would justify the relitigation of issues concluded by judicial decree years ago.â€Â  The family court granted Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDoes deliberate concealment of a marital asset constitute extrinsic fraud when the concealment is part of a deliberate scheme to defraud, involving an unknown third party not subject to discovery?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this Court to disregard the findings of the family court who saw and heard the parties, and is in a better position to evaluate their credibility. Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981); Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues Respondentâ€™s deliberate concealment of $130,000 in proceeds generated from the sale of the coupleâ€™s pharmacy constitutes extrinsic fraud based on this Courtâ€™s opinion in Chewning v. Ford Motor Company, 354 S.C. 72, 579 S.E.2d 605.Â  Appellant argues the family court erred in limiting extrinsic fraud, as defined in Chewning, to misconduct perpetrated by attorneys.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tIn Chewning, we noted: \r\n\tGenerally speaking, only the most egregious misconduct, such as bribery of a judge or members of a jury, or the fabrication of evidence by a party in which an attorney is implicated will constitute fraud on the court.Â  Less egregious misconduct, such as nondisclosure to the court of facts allegedly pertinent to the matter before it, will not ordinarily rise to the level of fraud on the court.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 78, 579 S.E.2d at 608 (citing Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., 573 F.2d 1332, 1338 (5th Cir. 1978)).Â  Extrinsic fraud â€œinduces a person not to present a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.â€Â  Id. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (citing Hilton Head Ctr. of South Carolina v. Public Serv. Commâ€™n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)).Â  On the other hand, intrinsic fraud â€œis fraud which was presented and considered in the trialâ€ and which â€œmisleads a court in determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the fraud.â€Â  Id. (citing Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 529 S.E.2d 714 (2000); Hilton Head Ctr., 294 S.C. at 9, 362 S.E.2d at 176)).Â  \r\n \r\nThe essential distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud is the ability to discover the fraud.[1]Â  Equitable relief from a judgment â€œis granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that because the fraud prevented a party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there has never been a real contest before the court on the subject matter of the action.â€Â  Id.; see also Bryan v. Bryan, 220 S.C. 164, 167-68, 66 S.E.2d 609, 610 (1951) (â€œ[N]ot every fraud is sufficient to move a court of equity to grant relief from a judgment.Â  Generally speaking, in order to secure equitable relief, it must appear that the fraud was extrinsic or collateral to the question examined and determined in the action in which the judgment was rendered: intrinsic fraud is not sufficient for equitable relief.â€); Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 152, 591 S.E.2d 654, 657&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (â€œSouth Carolinaâ€™s strong policy towards finality of judgments trumps a partyâ€™s ability to set aside a judgment where, as here, the party could have discovered the evidence prior to trial.â€); Mr. G. v. Mrs. G., 320 S.C. 305, 308, 465 S.E.2d 101, 103 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œRelief is granted for extrinsic but not intrinsic fraud on the theory that the latter deceptions should be discovered during the litigation itself, and to permit such relief undermines the stability of all judgments.â€).[2]Â  Extrinsic fraud, as opposed to intrinsic fraud, is often difficult, if not impossible to discover during the litigation.Â  For example, concealing assets through an unknown third-party not subject to discovery is extrinsic fraud in that it constitutes conduct or activities outside of the court proceedings which deprive the other party of the opportunity to fully exhibit and try his case.Â  24 Am. Jur. 2d Divorce and Separation Â§ 435 (1998); Chewning, 354 S.C. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610.Â  Â Â \r\nIn Chewning, we held â€œthe subornation of perjury by an attorney and/or the intentional concealment of documents by an attorney are actions which constitute extrinsic fraud.â€Â  Id. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610.Â  However, our holding in Chewning does not limit the finding of extrinsic fraud to misconduct of an attorney or an officer of the court.Â  As we noted in Evans, fraud upon the court has been defined as â€œthat species of fraud which does, or attempts to, subvert the integrity of the Court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.â€Â  Evans v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 529, 366 S.E.2d 44, 46 (1988) (quoting H. Lightsey, J. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure, 408 (2nd ed. 1985)) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n \r\nIn Evans, the former husband brought an action for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, when he discovered his former wife had induced him to sign an affidavit waiving his right to plead or appear for the divorce action when he was extremely intoxicated.Â  We noted that while the former wifeâ€™s perjury would fall in the intrinsic fraud category, â€œher actions in inducing Evans to sign such a waiver form, denying him his opportunity to be heard were such as could be considered extrinsic fraud under Rule 60(b).â€Â  Id. at 529, 366 S.E.2d at 47.Â  The fraud in Evans was not solely perjury or concealing documents, acts which alone would constitute intrinsic fraud.Â  Evans involved an act of intrinsic fraud accompanied by an intentional act or scheme to defraud or mislead the court, making the fraud rise to the level of extrinsic fraud.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the instant case, Respondent misrepresented the existence of the marital assets when ordered by the court to produce an accounting.Â  This was intrinsic fraud.Â  See Chewning, 354 S.C. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (â€œthe failure to disclose to an adversary or court matters which would defeat oneâ€™s own claim is intrinsic fraudâ€) (quoting Hilton Head Ctr., 294 S.C. at 11, 362 S.E.2d at 177).Â  However, in this case, as in Evans, there was â€œa showing that one has acted with an intent to deceive or defraud the court.â€Â  Chewning, 354 S.C. at 78, 579 S.E.2d at 608 (â€œit [is] essential that there be a showing of conscious wrongdoing - what can properly be characterized as a deliberate scheme to defraud - before relief from a final judgment is appropriate.â€).Â  In delaying the payment by CVS until after the divorce, Respondent engaged in â€œa deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme to defraud.â€Â  Id. at 79, 579 S.E.2d at 609 (quoting Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944)).Â  We hold an act of perjury or concealment of a document coupled with an intentional scheme to defraud the court justifies the setting aside of a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) due to extrinsic fraud.Â  See, e.g., Rozier, 573 F.2d at 1338&nbsp;(â€œIn order to set aside a judgment or order because of fraud upon the court under Rule 60(b) . . . it is necessary to show an unconscionable plan or scheme which is designed to improperly influence the court in its decision.â€) (internal citations omitted); Rathmell v. Morrison, 732 S.W.2d 6 (Tex. App. 1987) (holding a wrongful act coupled with misrepresentation of the value of companies in a property settlement agreement amounts to more than intrinsic fraud when former wife was prevented from having a fair opportunity to present evidence concerning the value of the companies); cf. Perry v. Heirs at Law of Gadsden, 357 S.C. 42, 590 S.E.2d 502 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding there was no extrinsic fraud absent a finding of a fraudulent intent).Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRespondentâ€™s actions rose to the level of extrinsic fraud when she engaged in a fraudulent scheme to hide assets from the court and, in doing so, utilized an unknown third party, CVS, not subject to discovery during the litigation.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the family courtâ€™s dismissal of this action and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., and MOORE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which WALLER, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, appellantâ€™s complaint alleges a classic instance of intrinsic fraud which the family court properly dismissed.Â  I would affirm.\r\nA party may bring a suit in equity to set aside a judgment at law allegedly procured by fraud as appellant has, or may move to set the judgment aside under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  While there are certain procedural differences depending on the form of the action, the legal principles are identical: relief is available where the earlier judgment was procured by extrinsic fraud, but a judgment obtained through the use of intrinsic fraud is not subject to collateral attack.Â  The majority and I agree on this point, as we do on the basic definition of intrinsic fraud: a fraud that goes to the merits of the earlier action, that is, to an issue of which the party had both notice and an opportunity to litigate in that prior suit.Â  E.g., Mr. G. v. Mrs. G., 320 S.C. 305, 465 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n \r\nAppellant alleges that respondent deliberately concealed a marital asset as part of a scheme to defraud appellant of his rightful share of the equitable division of marital property in the partiesâ€™ divorce action.Â  Appellant was undeniably aware that the identity and valuation of assets was at issue in that suit, and had the opportunity to litigate equitable distribution.Â  Accordingly, appellantâ€™s present complaint alleges only intrinsic fraud.Â  The policy reason underlying the bar to intrinsic fraud claims is predicated â€œon the theory that an issue which has been tried and passed upon in the original action should not be retried in an action for equitable relief against the judgment, and that otherwise litigation would be interminableâ€¦.â€Â  Bryan v. Bryan, 220 S.C. 164, 168, 66 S.E.2d 609, 610 (1951) (internal citation omitted).Â  The need for finality of judgments, as well as the potential for endless relitigation, is especially strong in family court matters.\r\n \r\nIn Bryan, the Court was asked the then-novel question whether perjury or false swearing could form the basis for an action to set aside a judgment.Â  The Court acknowledged the validity of criticisms leveled at the intrinsic/extrinsic fraud distinction, but ultimately adopted that rule.Â  In deciding to adopt this rule, the Court recognized that â€œthe classic example of intrinsic as contrasted with extrinsic fraud is the commission of perjury by a witness.Â  While perjury is a fraud upon the court [it is insufficient for attacking a judgment] because the materiality of the testimony and the opportunity to attack it, was open at the trial.â€Â  Bryan at 268, 66 S.E.2d at 611 (internal citation omitted); but see Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 579 S.E.2d 605, fn.2 (2003)(stating that perjury or false swearing is not a fraud upon the court).\r\nThe Bryan Court did, however, leave open the possibility that exceptional circumstances involving intrinsic fraud may justify equitable relief.Â  To date, the only time an exception has been made is in Chewning, where the Court held the subornation of perjury by an attorney, or the intentional concealment of documents by an attorney, is a sufficient fraud upon the court to allow a collateral attack on a judgment.Â  In Chewning we were careful to reiterate that perjury by a party or witness, such as the failure of a party to disclose to its adversary or to the court matter which would defeat that partyâ€™s claim, or a partyâ€™s failure to disclose requested documents, is intrinsic fraud which cannot support a collateral attack on the judgment.Â  Chewning at 82-83, 579 S.E.2d at 610-611; see also Raby Constr., LLP v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 594 S.E.2d 478 (2004).\r\nThe fraud alleged by appellant here is classic intrinsic fraud.Â  The majorityâ€™s reliance on a federal case decided under Rule 60(b), FRCP,[3] and a Texas decision[4] is misplaced.Â  In the federal case, the defendantâ€™s attorneys were responsible for the concealment of a document,[5] a Chewning situation.Â  In the Texas case, the court concluded that the husbandâ€™s threats to the wife which caused her to forego an appraisal was â€œnot only some evidence of extrinsic fraud, but â€¦ evidence â€¦ sufficient to support a jury finding thereon.â€[6]Â  Here, the alleged concealment of an asset by a party, even one which should have been disclosed pursuant to court ordered discovery, is not extrinsic fraud.Â  Chewning at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610-611.\r\nThe majorityâ€™s attempt to limit its new rule to Â­Â­situations where a partyâ€™s perjury or concealment is intended to defraud the court does nothing more than restate the current definition of intrinsic fraud.Â  As the Bryan Court recognized, all perjury and all document concealment by a party is an attempt to defraud the court.Â  Furthermore, a person does not commit perjury unless the false testimony is given â€œwillfully.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-10 (2003).Â  If we are to overrule Bryan and eliminate the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud, then we should acknowledge that we are doing so, not couch it as a â€œnewâ€ definition of extrinsic fraud.Â  In my opinion, however, the strong policy reasons favoring the finality of judgments, especially in family court, militate strongly in favor of retaining the extrinsic/intrinsic fraud distinction.Â  Finally, the majority holds that â€œan act of perjury or concealment of a document coupled with an intentional scheme to defraud the court justifies the setting aside of a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) due to extrinsic fraud.â€Â  I simply note that the present case was brought as an independent action, not as a motion under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.\r\nFor the reasons given above, I would affirm the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of this suit.\r\nWALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See generally In re Marriage of Melton, 33 Cal. Rptr. 2d 761 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994) (no extrinsic fraud found where husband misrepresented value of pension benefits with the assistance of the benefit plan administrator where the plan was a party to the action and wifeâ€™s counsel could have discovered the concealed information through discovery); Bankston v.

Jones, both of Barnwell Whaley Patterson &amp; Helms, LLC, of Charleston, for appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tLawrence E. Richter, Jr., and David K. Haller, both of Richter &amp; Haller, LLC, of Mt. Pleasant, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  This appeal is from a temporary injunction[1] issued in an action brought by respondent Atwood Agency (Atwood) alleging that appellant Elaine Shaw misappropriated trade secrets when she left its employ.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAtwood is a vacation rental business on Edisto Island that matches homeowners (rental property owners) with renters (those seeking vacation accommodations).Â  Shaw worked for Atwood as a property manager from 1990 until August 26, 2005, when she left and began work for another vacation rental agency, Edisto Sales and Rental Realty, Inc. (Edisto Sales).Â  Shawâ€™s job as a property manager involved overseeing the rental of vacation homes in Edisto Beach, including contact with both renters and rental property homeowners.Â \r\n \r\nAfter Shaw left its employ, Atwood commenced the underlying action alleging Shaw had misappropriated its homeowners list and its renters list and was using them to take business from Atwood to Edisto Sales.Â  Atwood claimed it had lost more than fifty rental homes causing damages amounting to â€œhundreds of thousands of dollarsâ€ in revenue.Â  It alleged, among other causes of action, a violation of the South Carolina Trade Secrets Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-10 et seq.Â  \r\n \r\nOn December 1, 2005, the circuit court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order based on the affidavit of Mark Steedley, Atwoodâ€™s president, restraining Shaw and the other appellants employed at Edisto Sales from â€œcontacting and contracting withâ€ any vacation renter or homeowner of Atwoodâ€™s.Â  Bond was set at $250.Â  After a hearing, the circuit court issued an order granting Atwoodâ€™s motion for a temporary injunction.Â  The court found Atwoodâ€™s renter list and homeowners list were trade secrets and reiterated the terms of the temporary restraining order.Â  The circuit court refused to grant a supersedeas pending appeal.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the information regarding homeowners and renters qualify as a trade secret?\r\n\t2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the amount of bond insufficient?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Temporary injunction\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in finding Shaw misappropriated trade secrets.Â  They claim the information regarding renters and homeowners is not â€œsecretâ€ because it is available from other sources.Â  We agree.\r\nThe South Carolina Trade Secrets Act authorizes an injunction against misappropriating a trade secret.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-30(C) (Supp. 2006).Â  A â€œtrade secretâ€ is defined as information, including a compilation, that :\r\n\r\n\t(i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by the public or any other person who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and\r\n\t(ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-20(5) (Supp. 2006).\r\nTemporary injunctive relief rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned unless the order is clearly erroneous.Â  Gilley v. Gilley, 327 S.C. 8, 488 S.E.2d 310 (1997); Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 167 S.E.2d 313 (1969).Â  The facts alleged must be sufficient to support a temporary injunction and the injunction must be reasonably necessary to protect the rights of the moving party.Â  Transcontinental, supra.Â  The merits of the underlying case are to be considered only to the extent necessary to determine whether there has been a prima facie showing to support a temporary injunction.Â  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001).Â  \r\n \r\nHere, the information that is the subject of the temporary injunction is readily ascertainable from other sources and therefore does not qualify for protection under Â§ 39-8-20(5).Â  It is undisputed that a list of all the homeowners in Edisto Beach and their contact information is a matter of public record available at Town Hall.Â  The record also indicates the names of renters were available to Shaw through other proper means.Â  According to Shaw, she was contacted directly by Atwood renters after Atwood sent out an announcement of her departure.Â  In addition, although by contract Atwood attempted to restrict homeownersâ€™ personal contact with renters, there is evidence that homeowners sometimes knew their renters or kept a guestbook where renters provided personal contact information.Â  \r\n \r\nBecause the information Atwood seeks to protect is available through other proper means, it is not protected as a trade secret.Â  Accordingly, we find the temporary injunction restraining appellants from contacting or contracting with Atwood clients clearly erroneous.\r\n2.Â  Security Bond\r\nThe circuit court ordered a security bond in the amount of $250 reasoning that â€œsince [appellants] have no right to the Atwood trade secrets, the damage which may be sustained by them as a result of this injunction is minimal.â€Â  Appellants contend this amount of bond is inadequate.Â  We agree.\r\n\r\n\tRule 65(c), SCRCP, provides that:\r\n\tno restraining order or temporary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\r\n\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s order requiring only a nominal security bond does not satisfy Rule 65(c) because it erroneously assumes the injunction is proper instead of providing an amount sufficient to protect appellants in the event the injunction is ultimately deemed improper.Â  In light of our finding that appellants were improperly enjoined, we remand to the circuit court to award the appropriate amount of costs and damages incurred as a result of the temporary injunction.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur. Â PLEICONES, J., concurring in part in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s ruling that Atwoodâ€™s homeowners list is not a trade secret as defined by the South Carolina Trade Secrets Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-10 et seq (â€œActâ€).Â  Accordingly, I agree that the circuit court improperly enjoined Shaw and other appellants employed at Edisto Sales from â€œcontacting and contractingâ€ with any Edisto Island homeowner on Atwoodâ€™s client list.Â  \r\n\r\nHowever, based upon the record before us, I cannot join the majorityâ€™s holding that Atwoodâ€™s renters list does not qualify as a trade secret.Â  I would thus affirm the temporary injunction in regards to Atwoodâ€™s renters list and allow Atwoodâ€™s cause of action based on a violation of the Act to proceed to trial.\r\nA vacation rental agency derives independent economic value from protecting the identity of its renters because the agencyâ€™s renters list is not â€œreadily ascertainable by proper meansâ€ by any other competing rental agency.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-20(5)(i) (Supp. 2006).Â  Atwood understandably attempts to prevent disclosure of its renters list in order to maintain clients, as repeat business is vital to its success.\r\nThe majority reasons that Atwoodâ€™s renters list is not a trade secret because some of Atwoodâ€™s renters contacted Shaw and because some renters provided personal contact information in guestbooks or directly to homeowners.Â  While these facts may be relevant to Shawâ€™s defense to Atwoodâ€™s claim that Shaw misappropriated[2] the renters list, i.e. received the identity of renters by improper means, they do not determine whether the renters list, taken as a whole, qualifies as a trade secret.Â  Regardless, simply because some renters chose to contact Shaw or because the occasional renter left his contact information does not make Atwoodâ€™s entire renters list â€œreadily ascertainable.â€\r\nAccordingly, I concur with the majority that Atwoodâ€™s homeowners list is not a trade secret as defined under the Act.Â  I also agree with the majorityâ€™s holding that the security bond ordered in this case was inadequate to satisfy Rule 65(c), SCRCP, and the case should be remanded to the circuit court for a determination of the proper amount of the security bond.Â  However, as to its renters list, Atwood has met the necessary criteria for a temporary injunction,[3] and I would allow Atwoodâ€™s claim under the Act to continue to trial.\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]An order granting a temporary injunction is directly appealable.Â  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2002). \r\n \r\n[2] Misappropriation of a trade secret is specifically defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-20(2) as:\r\n\r\n\t(a) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person by improper means;\r\n\t(b) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or\r\n\t(c) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who:\r\n\t(i) used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; \r\n\t\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\t(ii) at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was:\r\n\t(A) derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it;\r\n\t(B) acquired by mistake or under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or\r\n\t(C) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or\r\n\t(iii) before a material change of his position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.\r\n\r\n[3] To obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must demonstrate irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, and an inadequate remedy at law.Â  Scratch Golf Co. v.

Â \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondentâ€™s legal practice was devoted to the area of mortgage foreclosures in which respondent represented mortgagees.Â  The majority of respondentâ€™s mortgage foreclosures came from one client, hereafter referred to as Client A, and, to a lesser extent, foreclosures from several other clients, one of which is referred to as Client B.Â \r\n \r\nSeveral assistants and a bookkeeper worked for respondent in his law office.Â  A particular legal assistant (Legal Assistant) was responsible for managing the foreclosure operations of respondentâ€™s law firm.Â  The bookkeeper was responsible for making deposits and writing checks as directed by others in respondentâ€™s office.\r\n \r\nRespondent represents that in March 2005 he discovered that his office had not been handling money belonging to Client A in accordance with the net funding provisions of his retainer agreement and that the funds had been misdirected by someone in his office.Â  According to respondent, when he made this discovery, he immediately contacted Professor Robert Wilcox for ethical advice and retained J. Steedley Bogan as his legal and ethics counselor.Â  Shortly thereafter, respondent hired a CPA firm to audit his trust account concerning funds his law office handled for Client A.Â  Within days of receiving the completed audit from the CPA firm which confirmed misapplication of Client Aâ€™s funds, respondent reported the audit findings to Client A, promptly reimbursed Client A in the amount of $80,519.47 (which was the amount of funds the audit reported had been misdirected), and self-reported the matter to ODC.Â \r\n \r\nLater, after ODC began reviewing records furnished by respondent, it was discovered additional funds (albeit in relatively smaller amounts) had also been diverted from Client A and that funds had also been diverted from Client B.Â  Respondent represents that he promptly paid the additional amounts to Clients A and B and believes no additional amounts are due Clients A and B.Â \r\n \r\nMore specifically, respondentâ€™s law firm (Pincelli &amp; Associates) had a written agreement for services (the Retainer Agreement) with Client A which provided, among other things, that there would be no â€œnet fundingâ€ (i.e., that all proceeds from foreclosure actions received by respondent as attorney for Client A would be forwarded to Client A along with respondentâ€™s statement for fees and costs which would then, if approved by Client A, be paid by Client A to respondent).Â  In other words, under the terms of the Retainer Agreement, respondent was not permitted to retain any monies whatsoever for fees and costs in connection with the foreclosure actions and, instead, respondent was required to remit all funds received on behalf of Client A directly to Client A and then look to Client A for subsequent payment of approved fees and costs for respondentâ€™s services related to mortgage foreclosures.Â \r\n \r\nIt is now known that Client A and Client B failed to receive all funds due them from the sale of several properties foreclosed upon by respondent.Â  In addition, Client A, Client B, and an unknown client were not timely paid some funds received by respondent or his law firm from the forfeiture of compliance deposits on properties where third parties were successful bidders at foreclosure sales.[2]Â  Instead, there was a misapplication of net funds of some of these defaulting bids.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Agreement details more than twenty occasions in which respondent did not forward funds to Client A, Client B, and an unknown client in accordance with the net funding provisions of the retainer agreements by either failing to remit all funds from the successful third party bidder on property where his clients had received foreclosure judgments in excess of the highest bid or failing to remit forfeited third party deposits to his clients.[3]Â   \r\nIn each of the occasions detailed in the Agreement, respondentâ€™s bookkeeper wrote checks on respondentâ€™s trust account either upon respondentâ€™s own direction or that of Legal Assistant.Â  Either respondent or Legal Assistant instructed the bookkeeper on the amount and payee for each check.Â  All checks were signed by respondent.Â  The checks from respondentâ€™s trust account were made payable to Legal Assistant, to respondent, to respondentâ€™s law firm, to others, and, on one occasion, to Bank of America for an amount owed by respondent.Â  Â Â \r\nRespondent represents he was unaware that the client funds were being withheld in contravention of the retainer agreements when he signed the trust account checks and, consequently, unaware that the checks he signed to himself, his law firm, and others were for funds belonging to Clients A and B and an unknown client.Â  Respondent represents Legal Assistant withheld and caused to be disbursed the monies so withheld on her own initiative without instructions from respondent.Â \r\n \r\nAs noted above, respondent represents that, when he became aware of the improper withholding of the client funds, he sought legal advice, had an audit completed, and promptly remitted the funds due to Client A.Â  Thereafter, he submitted as self-report with ODC.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\tIn the self-report, respondent represented as follows:\r\n\tWhen a property was foreclosed upon and sold at the Masterâ€™s sale my bookkeeper received the sale proceeds from the Court.Â  [The bookkeeper] had been instructed to forward to [Client A] the actual amount of their authorized bid and then retain in the trust account the excess which was actually paid by a third party.Â  The amount retained was then to be disbursed \r\n\tin part to the law firm to pay costs and fees.Â  Any remainder was to be disbursed to the client.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tFortunately, the audit revealed that no funds were stolen by the bookkeeper.Â  Instead, these funds were paid by the bookkeeper to my law firm general account and were used in our normal course of doing business.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tWhile I had no prior knowledge that this was the bookkeeperâ€™s practice, I now recognize, and should have recognized at the time, that the excess funds should have been sent to the client.\r\n\tI provided a copy [of that audit report] to the client and immediately forwarded [Client A] a check for $80,519.47 which was the amount that the audit determined that I owed. \r\n\t\r\n\tI am writing the Commission to let you know that I have failed to properly supervise the bookkeeper who was processing the trust account.Â  It appears â€¦ that I have violated Rule 417 in that I did not operate my [trust] account in strict compliance with Rule 417 by personally approving each foreclosure settlement sheet and by personally making sure that monthly reconciliations of the trust account were performed.Â  I also admit that I violated Rule 1.15(b) in not safekeeping my clientâ€™s money.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe self-report incorrectly indicates that the amounts then known due to Client A were the result of bookkeeper error.Â  However, it is now known that the amounts so withheld from Client A were not in any way due to any fault, mistake, or wrongdoing on the part of the bookkeeper.Â  Further, the self-report incorrectly states that the funds withheld were paid into respondentâ€™s law firm general account and used in the â€œnormal course of doing business.â€Â  However, it is now known that some of the funds were paid not only into respondentâ€™s general account but, on occasion, paid directly to respondent, his employees, and, at least in one instance, toward amounts due on respondentâ€™s credit card.Â  Respondent represents the incorrect statements in his self-report were unintended.Â  He readily acknowledged the inaccuracies of the initial information after reviewing additional information and bank records and discussing the matter with his own counsel and ODC.Â  Â \r\nRespondent acknowledges that he failed to properly supervise Legal Assistant in the handling of the foreclosure actions and the disbursement of the proceeds therefrom.Â  He agrees he allowed Legal Assistant, a paralegal with considerable experience in foreclosure actions, to handle most all aspects of the foreclosures referenced in the Agreement with virtually no supervision or guidance.Â  Respondent acknowledges telling Legal Assistant when he needed certain amounts of money paid to himself, his law firm, or others, but, again, represents he was unaware these amount were being paid from monies belonging to clients.Â  ODC has no factual basis to dispute this representation and, in fact, Legal Assistant confirmed respondentâ€™s representation in a sworn interview.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent further acknowledges that he failed to personally reconcile his trust account on a monthly basis as required by the provisions of Rule 417, SCACR, and that he failed to comply with provisions of some retainer agreements, both of which facilitated the misapplication of the clientsâ€™ funds.Â  Furthermore, respondent now recognizes that allowing Legal Assistant to handle the mortgage foreclosure aspect of his law practice with almost no supervision by a licensed attorney caused him to assist Legal Assistant in the unauthorized practice of law.Â \r\n \r\nFurther, respondent recognizes that he provided incorrect information in his initial report to ODC and in his response to ODCâ€™s Notice of Full Investigation.Â  However, respondent represents that these misrepresentations were unintentional and now acknowledges that a more careful review of his files and bank records prior to filing his self-report and response to the Notice of Full Investigation would have precluded these incorrect representations.Â  In mitigation, but not as a defense, respondent points out that this incorrect information was not apparent from the audit report.Â  ODC has no factual basis to dispute these representations, especially in view of Legal Assistantâ€™s sworn testimony supporting the representations made by respondent.Â \r\n \r\nThe audit report states respondentâ€™s law firm used the trust account to hold funds from fees earned by respondent as a lecturer.Â  After respondent received the audit report, he removed the lecture fee funds from the trust account.Â  Respondent recognizes that, in placing those lecture fees in his trust account, he commingled non-client funds with client funds.Â  Â Â \r\nRespondent asserts that all amount known due to Clients A and B have been repaid.Â  He agrees that, should it be discovered that any additional amounts are due to any clients as a result of the misconduct herein, he shall pay the amounts as quickly as practical.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent has not been previously sanctioned for professional misconduct nor found to have committed professional misconduct by the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, its predecessor entity, the Board of Grievances and Discipline, or this Court.Â Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer shall not violate oath of office). Â Respondent further admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.15 (upon receiving funds which belong to a client, lawyer shall promptly deliver the funds to the client); Rule 5.1 (lawyer shall charge reasonable fee); Rule 5.3 (lawyer having supervisory authority over non-lawyer employee shall make reasonable efforts to ensure non-lawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with professional obligations of lawyer); and \r\nRule 5.5 (lawyer shall not assist non-lawyer in performance of activity which constitutes unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â Finally, respondent admits that he has violated the recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose a two year definite suspension from the practice of law, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  In addition, as stated in the Agreement, within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs of ODCâ€™s investigation into this matter to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.[4]Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J. MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] On August 10, 2005, the Court placed respondent on interim suspension.Â  See In the Matter of Pincelli, 365 S.C. 343, 618 S.E.2d 883 (2005).\r\n[2] These forfeitures occurred when a successful bidder on a parcel of property made a â€œgood faithâ€ deposit of 5% of the sales price and then failed to tender the balance of the sales price within thirty days of the sale.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] For purposes of illustration, the Court sets forth one of those occasions.Â  Respondent brought a foreclosure action on behalf of Client A against a mortgagor seeking to foreclose a mortgage on a parcel of property.Â  Respondent obtained a judgment of foreclosure against the defendant in the amount of $82,893.44.Â  Client A instructed respondent to bid $23,000 at the sale.Â  A third party was the successful bidder with a bid of $23,100.Â  After the deduction of statutory costs and disbursements, respondent received from the court hearing net sales proceeds of $22,857 which was deposited into respondentâ€™s trust account.Â  Thereafter, respondent remitted only $22,400 of the sales proceeds to Client A, leaving a balance of $457 in respondentâ€™s trust account.Â  The $457 was paid by check signed by respondent to Pincelli and Associates.Â  Since the successful high bid by the third party was less than the judgment rendered to Client A, all net proceeds were the property of Client A and therefore $457 should have been paid to Client A. Â Â \r\n[4] The Agreement provides that ODCâ€™s costs were $916.50.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26350","title":"Davis v.

Wade Cleveland, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tMatthew J. Kappel, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: This is a school discipline case where the hearing officer disciplined respondent Eddie Christopher Davis by transferring him from Wade Hampton High School to an alternative school.Â  The Greenville County School Board (â€œthe Boardâ€) affirmed the transfer, but the circuit court reversed.Â  The School District of Greenville County (â€œthe Districtâ€) directly appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  We reverse and vacate.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 24, 2004, respondentâ€™s teacher â€œsmelled a peculiar odorâ€ coming from the area of two students which she concluded was the smell of marijuana.Â  The assistant principal, Terry Carnes, took respondent and the other student to his office where Carnes decided the odor was coming from respondentâ€™s clothes and hands.Â  The principal, Bill Utsey, confirmed the smell of marijuana on respondentâ€™s hands and clothing.[1]Â  As a result, respondent was suspended and, pursuant to the Districtâ€™s discipline policy, expulsion proceedings were initiated.[2]\r\nThat same day, respondentâ€™s mother was sent a letter informing them of the suspension and the fact that expulsion was being recommended.Â  Prior to the hearing, another letter went out informing respondentâ€™s mother of respondentâ€™s rights, including the right to a hearing before a hearing officer, the right to be represented by counsel, and â€œall other regular rightsâ€ including the right to call and question witnesses.\r\nThe hearing was held on September 2, 2004, and respondent was represented by counsel.Â  Principal Utsey testified he smelled marijuana on respondentâ€™s clothes and hands, and therefore was required to recommend that respondent be expelled.Â  Respondent denied he had smoked marijuana the morning of August 24th but testified that he had smoked a Newport menthol cigarette before coming to school.Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent also presented evidence regarding drug screening tests he took on August 31, 2004, conducted by a company called Accurate Diagnostics.Â Â  The urinalysis and hair tests for marijuana both came back negative.Â  The office manager for Accurate Diagnostics testified that marijuana stays in a userâ€™s urine anywhere from 14 to 30 days, and respondentâ€™s hair sample would have shown marijuana use from the previous three months.Â  However, in response to the hearing officerâ€™s question of â€œhow little marijuana does one have to smoke to show up on a test,â€ the witness stated that if a person â€œsmoke[d] one joint, [then] that is supposed to show upâ€¦.Â  If someone takes one puff, it is likely that it may not show up.â€\r\nBased on the evidence that three people smelled marijuana on respondent, the hearing officer ruled the misconduct charge was supported by the evidence.Â  Respondent, however, was not expelled; instead, the hearing officer assigned respondent to the Districtâ€™s alternative program.Â  Respondent appealed to the Board which affirmed the hearing officerâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent then appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court ruled respondent had the right to appeal under S.C. Code section 59-63-240 and summarily reversed the Boardâ€™s decision.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court have subject matter jurisdiction to review the Boardâ€™s decision affirming respondentâ€™s transfer to the alternate program? \r\n \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe District argues the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to review the Boardâ€™s decision because the statute governing the transfer of a student does not provide for appeal beyond the Board.Â  Respondent, on the other hand, asserts that because expulsion proceedings were initiated, this matter is governed by the expulsion statute which specifically allows for an appeal from the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  We agree with the District and find the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear respondentâ€™s appeal.\r\nIn Title 59 of the S.C. Code, Chapter 63, Article 3 specifically addresses the issue of student discipline. Â Section 59-63-240 states as follows, in relevant part: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe board may expel for the remainder of the school year a pupil for any of the reasons listed in Â§ 59-63-210.[3]Â  If procedures for expulsion are initiated, the parents or legal guardian of the pupil shall be notified in writing of the time and the place of a hearing either before the board or a person or committee designated by the board.Â  At the hearing the parents or legal guardian shall have the right to legal counsel and to all other regular legal rights including the right to question all witnesses.Â  If the hearing is held by any authority other than the board of trustees, the right to appeal the decision to the board is reserved to either party.â€¦ Â The pupil may be suspended from school and all school activities \r\n\tduring the time of the expulsion procedures. Â The action of the board may be appealed to the proper court.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-63-240 (2004) (emphasis added).Â  The statutory section governing the transfer of students provides:\r\n\r\n\tThe board or a designated administrator may transfer a pupil to another school \r\n\tin lieu of suspension or expulsion but only after a conference or hearing with the parents or legal guardian. Â The parents or legal guardian may appeal a transfer made by an administrator to the board.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-63-250 (2004) (emphasis added).\r\nIn Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861&nbsp;(1996), this Court dealt with a similar situation.Â  There, a student had been suspended for 10 days for coming to a high school football game after drinking alcohol.Â  The student attempted to appeal the suspension to the circuit court which ruled it lacked jurisdiction over public school suspensions.Â  We upheld the finding of no subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Comparing the suspension statute[4] with the expulsion statute, we found that â€œthere exists a qualitative difference in the appellate procedures granted to students being suspended and those being expelled.â€Â  Id. at 433, 468 S.E.2d at 865.Â  Specifically, the Byrd Court stated that â€œ[b]ecause the expulsion provision expressly grants the student a right to appeal to â€˜the proper court,â€™ and no such language exists in the suspension provision, it appears that the Legislature intended that suspended students not be entitled to a right to appeal beyondâ€ the Board level.[5] Â Id. at 433-34, 468 S.E.2d at 865.\r\nIn the instant case, the section governing the transfer of a student is similar to the suspension statute at issue in Byrd:Â  it does not provide for an appeal beyond the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  See Â§ 59-63-250.Â  Therefore, consistent with the plain language of section 59-63-250 and the reasoning of Byrd, we find the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain respondentâ€™s appeal.Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent contends, however, that because the proceedings began as expulsion proceedings, and the procedure initially followed by the District was pursuant to the expulsion statute, see Â§ 59-63-240, he retains the full appellate rights outlined in that statutory section.Â  Respondent further maintains that because the statutory language provides that the â€œaction of the board may be appealed to the proper courtâ€ - without regard to whether the action resulted in an actual expulsion - the circuit court properly found it had the power to review the Boardâ€™s action in this case.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€ Â Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581&nbsp;(2000).Â  Furthermore, the â€œgoal of statutory construction is to harmonize conflicting statutes whenever possible and to prevent an interpretation that would lead to a result that is plainly absurd.â€ \r\n    Id. at 91, 533 S.E.2d at 584.\r\nSection 59-63-250 expressly provides for discipline in the form of a transfer â€œin lieu of suspension or expulsion;â€ therefore, it plainly envisions the possibility that the student may be involved in expulsion proceedings prior to being transferred.Â  The statute then specifically provides for only one level of appeal.Â  Had the Legislature intended for a transferred student to have all the rights outlined in the expulsion statute, it could have provided specifically for that procedure in section 59-63-250.Â  We therefore hold the Legislature intended that when a student is merely transferred, and not expelled, the review of the decision ends with the Board.Â  See Â§ 59-63-250; Hodges v. Rainey, supra (the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature).\r\nIndeed, a contrary interpretation would create a significant conflict between sections 59-63-240 and 59-63-250, allowing further appellate review of a transfer if the proceedings were initiated under the expulsion statute, but not of a transfer initiated under the transfer statute.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, supra (statutes should be harmonized whenever possible to prevent an interpretation that would lead to a result that is plainly absurd); see also Aledo Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Reese, 987 S.W.2d 953, 958 (Tex. App. 1999) (where the court held that a studentâ€™s transfer to an alternative education program was not an expulsion, in part because the applicable statutes provided no district court review for alternative placements but allowed further court review for expulsions).Â  Thus, once the hearing officer rejected expulsion and imposed the sanction of transfer, the transfer statute became applicable.Â  That sectionâ€™s appellate procedure simply does not provide for appeal of the Boardâ€™s decision to the circuit court.Â  See Â§ 59-63-250.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the Boardâ€™s decision.[6]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s decision and vacate the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\n \r\nREVERSED AND VACATED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] It is undisputed that no one observed any visual signs respondent was under the influence of marijuana.Â  The only evidence of marijuana use was the odor detected on respondentâ€™s hands and clothes.\r\n[2] The Districtâ€™s Discipline Code provides that if a high school student comes onto school property after using an illegal drug, as â€œevidenced by scent, actions or admission,â€ the result will be that the principal recommends expulsion.\r\n[3] Section 59-63-210(A) sets forth the reasons a district board of trustees may authorize the expulsion, suspension, or transfer of a student, including â€œfor violation of written rules and promulgated regulations established by the district board.â€\r\n[4] This section provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhen a pupil is suspended from a class or a school, the administrator shall notify, in writing, the parents or legal guardian of the pupil, giving the reason for such suspension and setting a time and place when the administrator shall be available for a conference with the parents or guardian. Â The conference shall be set within three days of the date of the suspension. Â After the conference the parents or legal guardian may appeal the suspension to the board of trustees or to its authorized agent.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-63-230 (2004).\r\n[5] In Floyd v. Horry County Sch. Dist.,&nbsp;351 S.C. 233, 569 S.E.2d 343&nbsp;(2002), we clarified Byrd and held that a student may appeal to circuit court â€œfor the sole purpose of challenging a temporary school suspension underâ€ the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975).Â  Floyd, 351 S.C. at 237, 569 S.E.2d at 345.Â  This Court further stated that â€œ[i]f the minimal procedural standards of Goss v. Lopez are met, the suspension shall be affirmed.â€Â  Id.&nbsp; Pursuant to Goss v. Lopez, the minimal process constitutionally due a student for a suspension of ten days or less is:Â  (1) oral or written notice of the charges; (2) an explanation of the evidence; and (3) an opportunity to present his side of the story.Â  419 U.S. at 579.Â  The instant appeal does not involve respondentâ€™s initial temporary suspension.Â  We nevertheless note that minimal process standards clearly were met in this case.\r\n[6] We decline to address the remaining issues raised on appeal. Â See Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711 (2005) (the appellate court need not address additional issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26351","title":"In the Matter of O.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P. Turner, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tKeith M. Babcock, of Lewis and Babcock, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits the allegations therein constitute violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, and consents to the imposition of a six month suspension pursuant to Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent requests the suspension be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension. Â See In the Matter of Martin, 371 S.C. 33, 637 S.E.2d 560 (2006).Â  We accept the agreement and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for six months, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  Respondent was indicted in federal court on thirty counts of mail fraud.Â  The indictment resulted from respondentâ€™s allocation, at the direction of an officer of an insurance company for which respondent did defense work, of time and charges to several of the companyâ€™s files on which the time billed had not been spent.Â  Following indictment, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  See In the Matter of Martin, supra.Â  \r\n \r\nHowever, the indictment has since been dismissed.Â  Moreover, respondent represents that all of the time he billed to the company was in fact spent by him and computed at approved rates.Â  He further represents he did not bill the company for any amounts he or his firm were not due for legal services performed for the company.Â  Respondent has consistently maintained preparation of the statements requested by the officer did not constitute misconduct because he was not charging the company for any amounts not due him or his firm by the company, and he was preparing the statements with the knowledge and at the direction of the officer.[1]Â  However, in hindsight, respondent recognizes the pro rata allocation of fees on his firmâ€™s statements to the company, although at the direction of the officer, at least gave the appearance that the officer was seeking to mislead someone or some entity to the detriment of one party or to the advantage of another.Â  Respondent states that, in the future, he will make every effort to have all of his statements accurately reflect the time and charges related to the referenced file.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that the above allegations constitute a violation of the strict requirements of Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR (a \r\nlawyer shall not charge or collect an unreasonable fee), which could be construed as a violation of Rules 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and 8.4(e), RPC (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) as well.Â  Finally, respondent admits the allegation would constitute grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for six months, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nPrior to the submission of the agreement to this Court, respondent filed a Petition to Reconsider or Vacate and for Reinstatement in which he asked the Court to reconsider or vacate the interim suspension order and permit respondent to resume the practice of law.Â  We deny the request to reconsider or vacate the interim suspension order as moot.Â  With regard to respondentâ€™s request to be reinstated to the practice of law, he will first have to comply with the requirements of Rule 32, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â \r\n \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] It is not clear why the officer wanted respondentâ€™s time and charges allocated to other files respondent handled for the company.Â  The officer was terminated by the company based on alleged payments on fictitious claims generated by an adjuster in the State of Kentucky.Â  He subsequently pled guilty in federal court to a criminal offense related to his activities, but not related to the activities of respondent nor the averments in the indictment against respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26353","title":"Robert Lever v.

Â We reverse.[1]  \r\nFACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn April 1988, Leverage Builders was indebted to Lighting Galleries, Inc. in the sum of $36,256.97.Â  To secure this debt, Lever signed an agreement in which he agreed to give Lighting Galleries a fourth mortgage in a one-third undivided interest it owned in property in Aiken County.Â  The agreement provided that it was for a period of one year, and would accrue interest at the rate of 9% per annum.Â  A mortgage on the property was recorded simultaneously with the above agreement.Â Â  Thereafter, On June 14, 1988, Lever signed a Note agreeing to pay Lighting Galleries $36,256.97, to be paid per the terms of the agreement, at a rate of 9% interest, and subject to an attorneyâ€™s fee of 15% if collection became necessary.Â Â \r\n \r\nIn April 1989, when Lever did not timely pay in accordance with the partiesâ€™ one-year agreement, Lighting Galleries brought suit on the note in Aiken County, resulting in an order for judgment of $36,256.97, plus interest, as well as attorneyâ€™s fees of $5437.00.Â  The judgment was entered in Lancaster County.Â  It is undisputed that despite attempts to collect the debt, Lighting Galleries was unable to collect on its judgment, which expired ten years later, in April 1999.[2]Â  It is also undisputed that Lever has not paid the debt to date. \r\n \r\nLighting Galleries initially chose not to bring a foreclosure action on the mortgage because, in 1989 the property was worthless, having had an oil spill on it, and Lighting Galleries was only a fourth-mortgagee on a 1/3 interest in the property.Â \r\n \r\nAfter Lighting Galleriesâ€™ judgment lien expired, Lever filed a petition and Rule to Show Cause in the circuit court,[3] seeking a ruling that the mortgage on the property should be extinguished, and contending that Lighting Galleries, Inc. had previously elected its remedy, such that it was prohibited from thereafter pursuing a foreclosure action.[4]Â  Lever sought damages, costs and attorneys fees.Â Â  The matter was referred to the Master-in-Equity who held that the judgment obtained by Lighting Galleries on the note rendered the note and mortgage inoperative, such that the mortgage should be marked satisfied.Â  Lighting Galleries appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Master err in holding the mortgage should be marked satisfied?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Master held that â€œat the moment [Lighting Galleries] obtained the judgment on the note against [Lever], the indebtedness was then evidence by the order for judgment and no longer by the note, which became inoperative and of no further substance.Â  Since a mortgage is merely a security interest and must be based upon a note or other written evidence of an obligation, upon the entry of the judgment the mortgage likewise became inoperative since there is no provision in law for a mortgage to secure a judgment.â€Â  This was error.\r\nA mortgagee who has a note and a mortgage to secure a debt has the option to either bring an action on the note or to pursue a foreclosure action.Â  See Perpetual Bldg. and Loan Assâ€™n of Anderson v. Braun, 270 S.C. 338, 242 S.E.2d 407 (1978) (It is not implicit in the taking of a mortgage that the creditor is to look only to the property for satisfaction of the debt. Indeed, he may ignore the security and bring an action at law on the indebtedness, or he may proceed by foreclosure to satisfy his lien); Platt v. Carroll, 125 S.C. 493, 119 S.E. 180 (1923) (The bond is not the debt, nor is the mortgage the debt; the debt is the borrowed money; the bond and the mortgage are simply separate securities for the same debt, and the creditor may pursue either security that his interest may dictate); Hatfield v. Kennedy, 1 Bay, 501 (1793) (Wherever a man has a bond and mortgage, he may pursue both at the same time, or either of them, as he thinks proper).Â  See also Blackmon v. Patel, 302 S.C. 361, 363 396 S.E.2d 128, 130 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œSeller had no duty to pursue foreclosure of his mortgage before suing on the note. A creditor, including mortgagees, has the option of ignoring the security and suing on the note.â€ citing Edge v. Klutts Resort Realty, Inc., 276 S.C. 389, 278 S.E.2d 783 (1981); Perpetual Bldg. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Braun, 270 S.C. 338, 242 S.E.2d 407 (1978)).\r\n\r\n\tAs noted by 55 Am.Jur. 2d Mortgages Â§ 524:\r\n\tThe cases are uniform in holding that until the mortgage debt is actually satisfied, the recovery of a judgment on the obligation secured by a mortgage, without the foreclosure of the mortgage, although merging the debt in the judgment, has no effect upon the mortgage or its lien, \r\n\tdoes not merge it, and does not preclude its foreclosure in a subsequent suit instituted for that purpose, or the exercise of the power of sale contained in the mortgage or deed of trust.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\nLever contends the critical distinction in this case is because the judgment which Lighting Galleries obtained more than ten years ago has expired pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-810 (1976), the debt is now barred and the mortgage discharged.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\n \r\nLever cites Buist v. Dawes, 24 S.C. Eq. (3 Rich. Eq.) 281 (1851) for the proposition that Lighting Galleries, having elected to sue on the note and obtain a judgment, is bound thereby and may not now pursue a foreclosure action.Â  Buist does not support Leverâ€™s contention.Â  Buist held:\r\n\r\n\tWherever two rights are alternatively created, or given, either in express terms, or by construction, the party to whom they are given is entitled to only one of the two, and must elect between them; but after he has made his election he is bound, and will not be allowed to elect again, unless he can shew some equitable circumstances entitling him to retract the choice he has made.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBuist involved a widowâ€™s acceptance of dower rights which was held to destroy her right to a distributive share of her husbandâ€™s estate.Â  Buist is inapposite to those cases which allow a creditor to pursue either an action at law on a note, or proceeding by foreclosure of a mortgage.Â  Platt v. Carroll; Perpetual Bldg. and Loan Assâ€™n of Anderson v. Braun; Hatfield v. Kennedy, 1 Bay, 501 (1793); Blackmon v. Patel, Edge v. Klutts Resort Realty, Inc.\r\nLever also cites Gibbes v. Holmes, 31 S.C. Eq. (10 Rich. Eq.) 484 (1859) for the following proposition:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he debt must be presumed to be satisfied from the lapse of time. If this presumption prevails, the mortgage is as completely discharged as if the debt had been satisfied by actual payment. Where the statute of limitations applies, it is presumption\r\n\tjuris et de jure. Â It cannot be rebutted. Â A debtor may admit that the debt has not been paid, and in the same breath insist upon the protection and bar of the statute. But \r\n\ta presumption of satisfaction, arising from the lapse of time may be rebutted.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).Â  We find the facts of this case amply support the rebuttal of any presumption that the debt has been satisfied; Lever concedes that he has not paid the debt.Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, in Nichols v. Briggs, 18 S.C. 473 (1883), the Court held that the above-cited language in Gibbes was mere obiter dictum.Â  The question before the Nichols Court, as stated therein, was as follows: â€œAssuming that recovery on the note considered by itself could not be had on account of the statute of limitations, must the mortgage of real property, given to secure the same debt, also be considered as barred?â€Â  The Court went on to hold that â€œThe note given is only evidence of the debt and one of the means of collecting it, and if there is a mortgage, that is only another security for the same debt. . . . A mortgage being given as a security for a debt, the general rule is that no mere change in the mode or time of payment, nothing short of an actual payment of the debt or an express release, will operate as a discharge of the mortgage. The lien lasts as long as the debt. Â 1 Hill. Mort., Â§ 3. The mortgage would have been good as a security for the $500 even if the bond had never been given.â€Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  The Nichols Court went on to state:\r\n\r\n\tWhat effect did the bar of the note by the statute of limitations have upon the debt evidenced by the note and also secured by the mortgage? It is well settled that the effect of the statute is only to take away the remedy, and not to extinguish the debt. When a security is barred the debt is not thereby necessarily discharged. \r\n\tWilson v. Kelly, 16 S. C. 216. The rule that the discharge of the debt is a discharge of the mortgage has no application when the debt is merely discharged by the statute of limitations or a discharge in bankruptcy. . . \r\n\t\r\n\tThough the debt be barred, the lien may be enforced.Â  The fact that a debt secured by a mortgage is barred by a statute of limitations, does not necessarily, or as a general rule, extinguish the mortgage security or prevent the maintaining an action to enforce it.â€ 2 Jones \r\n\tMort., Â§ 1204 and notes.Â  This is the general rule, and we see no reason founded in principle why it should not be adopted here.\r\n\r\nNichols, 18 S.C. 473.Â   \r\nA creditor shall not have two satisfactions for the same debt, but there is no inconsistency in his pursuing two remedies.Â  If one produces satisfaction, that is a bar to the other.Â  A mortgage is a specific lien, and a judgment is a general lien.Â  Both may be consistently pursued, until the debt is satisfied.Â  Satterwhite v. Kennedy, 3 Strob. 459 (1849).Â \r\n \r\nWe hold that Lighting Galleries may pursue a foreclosure action notwithstanding its judgment against Lever was extinguished by virtue of the statute of limitations.Â  The order of the Master-in-Equity is reversed.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This matter was certified from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  \r\n \r\n[2] Â Judgment liens on real estate continue for ten years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-810 (1976).Â  \r\n \r\n[3] Â Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-3-360, â€œ[a]ny person who is indebted by mortgage on real estate may apply to the presiding judge or any court of general sessions and common pleas to be held in the county in which the mortgage on real estate is recorded for a rule to show cause why satisfaction must not be entered thereon.â€\r\n[4]Â  Lighting Galleries was not, at the time, seeking to foreclose on the property.Â Â  However, the property has significantly increased in value recently due to SCDOT wishing to purchase the property at a price of $15,000 per acre.Â  Another party has also recently expressed interest in purchasing the remainder of the mortgaged property.Â  Additionally, although Lighting Galleries was initially a fourth mortgage holder, only two mortgages currently exist on the property.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26354","title":"Office of Regulatory Staff v.

Â§ 609 (2002). Â The Telecommunications Act was intended, in part, to promote an initiative of â€œuniversal service.â€Â  Congress hoped that a nationwide telecommunications policy of â€œuniversal serviceâ€ would ensure access to basic telephone service at affordable rates for all Americans.[2] Â Congress did so by mandating that the new system of universal service be â€œexplicit,â€ i.e., not dependent upon implicit subsidies. Â 47 U.S.C. Â§ 254(e) (2002). Â The Telecommunications Act provides â€œ[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service.â€ Â 47 U.S.C. Â§ 254(d) (2002).Â  In furthering the goal of nondiscriminatory universal service, Congress gave the states authority to adopt approaches for encouraging universal service. \r\n \r\nWith the enactment of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-280(E) (Supp. 2006), the South Carolina General Assembly authorized the Commission to establish a USF for South Carolina. Â The Commission held three proceedings to address implementation strategies for the fund. Â The first proceeding established the size of the USF as directed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-280(E).Â  In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 97-753 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. Sept. 3, 1997). Â The second proceeding determined the appropriate cost models and sizing of South Carolinaâ€™s USF.[3]Â  In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 98-322 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. May 6, 1998).Â  The Commission selected a forward-looking cost proxy model for non-rural companies and the Benchmark Cost Proxy Model as the state forward-looking cost model for BellSouth, GTE, and Sprint/United.Â  The Commission adopted the South Carolina Telephone Coalitionâ€™s (SCTC) embedded cost model for rural local exchange carriers.[4] Â In the third proceeding, the Commission addressed various outstanding issues relating to the implementation of the fund.[5]Â  In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 2001-419 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. June 6, 2001).\r\nAppellants now challenge the Commissionâ€™s findings arising out of these proceedings. \r\n \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n \r\n\t\t\tDid Appellants bring a timely \r\n\t\t\tappeal of Commission Orders 98-322, 97-753, and 97-942[6]? \r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tIs the USF, as established and \r\n\t\t\timplemented by the Commission, â€œspecific, predictable and \r\n\t\t\tsufficientâ€ in accordance with Section 254(f) of the Federal \r\n\t\t\tTelecommunications Act and does the fund comply with S.C. Code Ann. \r\n\t\t\tÂ§ 58-9-280(E)(4)? \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\tIs Section 254(f) of the Federal Telecommunications Act violated because the State USF burdens federal universal support mechanisms? \r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.&nbsp; \r\n \r\n\t\t\tDoes the State USF bar \r\n\t\t\tcompetitive entry in violation of Section 253 of the Federal \r\n\t\t\tTelecommunications Act?&nbsp; \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV.&nbsp; \r\n \r\n\t\t\tDoes the State USF fail to match \r\n\t\t\tcosts and revenues in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-280(E)? \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid the Commission allocate 25% \r\n\t\t\tof network costs to federal jurisdiction, and if the Commission did not make such an allocation, did it violate FCC regulations?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVI. \r\n\t\t\tDoes the evidence in the record \r\n\t\t\tsupport the Commissionâ€™s finding that intrastate access charges are \r\n\t\t\tpriced above cost and provide a significant implicit subsidy to \r\n\t\t\tbasic local service?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n&nbsp;LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nÂ The findings of the Commission are presumptively correct and have the force and effect of law. Â Therefore, the burden of proof is on the party challenging an order of the Commission to show it is unsupported by substantial evidence and the decision is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record. Â Heater of Seabrook Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 20, 27 n.4, 503 S.E.2d 739, 742 n.4 (1998).Â  Substantial evidence is something less than the weight of the evidence and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984).\r\nBecause Appellants have failed to prove the Commissionâ€™s implementation of the State USF is clearly erroneous, we affirm.\r\nThe Commissionâ€™s orders are meticulous in their factual determinations and decisions regarding the appropriate methods for implementing the State USF.Â  The orders issued by the Commission throughout its consideration of the USF show careful consideration of numerous proposals on the fundâ€™s implementation.Â  See e.g., Or. No. 97-753 (Sept. 3, 1997); Or. No. 97-942 (Dec. 31, 1997); Or. No. 98-322 (May 6, 1998); Or. No. 2001-419 (June 6, 2001).Â  The orders alone and the orders for which the Commission considered motions for reconsideration have presented an insurmountable hurdle for Appellants in refuting the Commissionâ€™s conclusion substantial evidence supports its decisions in developing the intricacies of the fund.Â  Before addressing Appellantsâ€™ specific legal arguments, we discuss these orders to show how the Commission arrived at its decisions regarding the fund and to illuminate the evidence considered by the Commission in arriving at its decisions.\r\nOrder No. 98-322 is especially illustrative of the Commissionâ€™s decision-making process. Â Under the Federal Telecommunications Act, states faced an April 24, 1998 deadline to submit to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) a cost model for calculating federal support for non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers serving rural, insular and high cost areas. States failing to select a study satisfying FCC criteria, or states failing to submit a study, would be required to follow the FCCâ€™s cost model for federal universal service. Â Not only did the Commission attempt to adopt a model consistent with the FCC guidelines,[7] it elected to adopt the FCCâ€™s criteria in establishing the intrastate USF.[8] Â In Order 98-322, the Commission primarily considered which cost proxy model to adopt.[9]Â  In particular, the Commission evaluated the pros and cons of the Benchmark Cost Proxy Model Version 3.1 (BCPM 3.1) and the Hatfield Model Version 5.0a (HM 5.0a).Â  The Commission meticulously weighed the characteristics of each model.Â  One consideration was which model more accurately locates customers in rural and other high cost areas.Â  Locating customers in high cost areas is an essential function in estimating the requisite amount of funding for the state universal service plan. Â The Commission ultimately selected the BCPM 3.1, in part, because it found the HM 5.0a geocoding process inferior in large rural areas. Â Furthermore, the Commission carefully weighed the testimony of various cost experts. Â For example, in selecting the BCPM 3.1, the Commission found its network to be superior to that of the HM 5.0a. Â A witness for AT&amp;T testified that the HM 5.0a followed standard engineering design rules.[10] Â The Commission, however, determined the AT&amp;T witness could not substantiate his claim and considered testimony of other witnesses who agreed that the BCPM 3.1 followed standard engineering practices. Â Id.\r\nThe Commission also painstakingly addressed the arguments of the parties on their motions for reconsideration. Â See e.g., In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 98-201 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. March 17, 1998); In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 2001-704 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. Aug. 31, 2001).Â  For example in Order No. 2001-704, the Commission carefully considered the arguments of the Consumer Advocate, an Appellant in this case. Â In that order the Commission noted it had held extensive proceedings in the five previous years addressing guidelines for the USF, cost models, and methodologies.Â  On the cost methodology issue alone, the Commission heard the testimony of over twenty economic, engineering, and cost experts. Â The Commission went on to carefully consider the Consumer Advocateâ€™s arguments, which are raised again on appeal and discussed below.Â  We turn now to the issues raised by Appellants.\r\nI.\r\nSCCTA, SECCA, and the Consumer Advocate have timely appealed Commission Order 98-322, which addressed the cost studies to be employed by the Commission in sizing South Carolinaâ€™s USF. Â Commission Order No. 98-322 is not a final order because the order leaves further acts to be done by the Commission.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp. v. Faulkenberry, 337 S.C. 140, 146, 522 S.E.2d 822, 825 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Appellantsâ€™ SCCTA and SECCA correctly point out that in subsequent orders the Commission itself noted that it had not issued a final judgment on issues relating to the size of the USF.Â  In In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 2000-0518 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. June 21, 2000), the Commission specifically noted it had not yet considered issues such as â€œwhether only intrastate revenues may be taxed to create the fund, whether wireless revenues may be taxed, and how the Commission can and should deal with the elimination of implicit subsidies.â€ Â The Consumer Advocate correctly argues that the Commission ultimately determined the size of the fund in In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 2001-419 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. June 6, 2001) and disavowed previous estimates.Â  The Commissionâ€™s orders relating to the size and funding of the State USF cannot be read in isolation. Â Until the Commission issued Order 2001-419, the Commissionâ€™s orders allowed for modification as the particular strategy for implementation developed. Therefore, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding on this issue.\r\nSCCTAâ€™s and SECCAâ€™s appeal of Commission Order Nos. 97-753 and 97-942 are also properly before the Court.Â  Order No. 97-753 delineated guidelines for the State USF, determined the Commission would be the fundâ€™s administrator, and estimated the size of the fund.[11] Â In Order No. 97-753, the Commission specifically noted that certain issues relating to the fund would be decided in the future. Â Order No. 97-942 clarified issues discussed in Order No. 97-753 and held that the actual size of the fund would be determined de novo in future proceedings. Â Appellants were not required to appeal within thirty days after issuance of this order pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(1) (2005) because the order was not final. Â The hearings in 1999 and 2000 left various issues to be resolved. Â It was not until 2001 that the Commission issued final orders from which Appellants now timely appeal.[12] \r\n \r\nII.\r\nSCCTA and SECCA argue the fund violates Section 254(f) of the Federal Telecommunications Act because the Commission does not have sufficient control over the establishment, growth or operation of the fund. Section 254(f) of the Federal Telecommunications Act specifically requires a plan set forth â€œspecific, predictable, and sufficientâ€ mechanisms of control.[13]\r\nSCCTA and SECCA fail to prove the Commissionâ€™s findings relating to its control over the fund are erroneous. Â The record shows the Commission does, in fact, have sufficient control over the size of the fund. Â The Commission has twice changed the estimate of the actual size of the fund suggesting it has sufficient control over the fundâ€™s size.[14] Â Testimony by experts before the Commission indicates these estimates are still subject to modification. Â Testimony indicates the Commission will be reviewing any further implementation and the Commission has full oversight.Â  Gary Walsh, Executive Director of the Commission, provided detailed testimony on how certain variables can cause the estimated size of the fund to fluctuate.Â  Testimony also showed the $340 million estimate was calculated using the formula mandated by the General Assembly. Â Under the SCTAâ€™s plan, the support per line changes when there is a new cost study.Â  After the Commission reduces rates and allocates support for half of the $340 million, the Commission would conduct another cost study. Â Through this review process the Commission maintains control over the size of the fund.[15]\r\nThe record further reflects the Commission has imparted control mechanisms to ensure its control over the size of the fund by requiring incumbent local exchange carriers that apply for funding beyond the initial access step, file detailed cost data reports. Â The local incumbent exchange carriers must also update their cost studies before they can implement more than one-third of its company specific funding requirement. \r\n \r\nControl of the fund is also accomplished through the Commissionâ€™s phased-in approach.Â  The phased-in approach allows a gradual transition from the implicit support system to an explicit funding system.Â  The phased-in approach permits local exchange carriers to receive additional universal service funding to remove implicit support if the local exchange carriers can show the Commission that implicit support exists in particular rates. Â This process illustrates another method by which the Commission maintains control of the fund.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, the mechanism does not lack specificity and predictability because the term â€œimplicit subsidiesâ€ is undefined.Â  As Respondents point out, the term implicit subsidy has been repeatedly discussed throughout the Commissionâ€™s proceedings.Â  It is also true the FCC has likewise found it unnecessary to define the term. Â Sixth Report and Order in CC Docket Nos. 96-262 and 94-1, Report and Order in CC Docket Nos. 96-262 and 94-1, Report and Order in CC Docket No. 99-249, Eleventh Report and Order in CC Docket NO. 96-45, FCC 00-1893 (released May 31, 2000) at Â¶Â¶ 3, 23-24.\r\nThe State USF does not violate South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-280(E)(4). Â This statute specifically determines the size of the fund. Â The size of the fund is the difference between the cost of providing basic local exchange service for each carrier of last resort and the maximum amount the carrier could charge.[16] Â The Commission noted in Order No. 97-953 it must comply with the requirements of the Code, but â€œthe size of the fund must be adjusted over time as cost models are employed by the Commission and actual funding is required.â€Â  The sizing of the fund is flexible because variables such as federal funding, subscriber line charge, and cost requirements determined by updated studies may continually affect the fundâ€™s size.\r\nSECCA and SCCTA argue another violation of Section 254(f) in that the State USF imposes an impermissible burden on federal universal support mechanisms.[17] Â SECCA and SCCTA contend that the State fund burdens the federal fund because the Commissionâ€™s plan assesses contributions to the State USF on interstate and intrastate revenues.Â  In other words, the State USF imposes an additional surcharge on the same interstate revenues subject to the federal surcharge for the federal USF.\r\nWe agree with the trial courtâ€™s analysis on this issue. Â Both the trial court and the Commission determined that including interstate revenues does not burden federal universal support mechanisms.Â  SECCA and SCCTA cite AT&amp;T Communications v. Eachus, 174 F.Supp.2d 1119 (D. Or. 2001) in support of their position.Â  Eachus was decided subsequent to Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393 (5th Cir. 1999) (TOPUC). Â In TOPUC, the court held that the FCC lacked jurisdiction to assess intrastate revenues because of a statutory limitation on its jurisdiction. Â The TOPUC case dealt only with the FCCâ€™s jurisdiction, not the statesâ€™ jurisdiction, and therefore has no relevance in the present case. Â Relying on TOPUC, the Eachus court did, in fact, hold the assessment of interstate revenues for a state fund burdens the federal support mechanism.Â  We believe the case was incorrectly decided.Â  In Eachus, the court concluded if interstate carriers are assessed for both state and federal funds, then the carriers are burdened and therefore the federal mechanism is burdened.Â  174 F.Supp.2d at 1124. Clearly, the burden on carriers and the burden on the federal support mechanism are not necessarily synonymous.[18]  \r\nWe conclude substantial evidence demonstrates the State USF does not violate Section 254(f).\r\nIII.\r\nSECCA and SCCTA argue the State USF violates the Federal Telecommunications Act because it is not competitively neutral and acts as a barrier to competition.[19]Â  A close analysis of how the USF operates reveals Appellants have failed to prove the fund operates on a discriminatory basis. Essentially, SECCA and SCCTA argue the USF, as currently adopted by the Commission, functions to discriminate against competitive local exchange services because incumbent local exchange carriers can lower prices for competitive services and then have the reduction subsidized by the USF.Â  Appellantsâ€™ argument is only valid if competitive local exchange carriers are denied access to the funds under the Commissionâ€™s plan. Â The record shows this is not necessarily the case.Â  In fact, as the trial court points out, the competitive local exchange services may actually lose a competitive advantage with the implementation of the USF.[20]Â  Because the implicit support becomes explicit, all companies should be able to compete on a more equal playing field. Â Competitive local exchange carriers will also become responsible for paying into the fund. Â Furthermore, competitive local exchange carriers are not denied access to the fund. Â Commission Order No. 2001-419 states, \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThere is no earnings review requirement before a company can receive Federal Universal service funding. We likewise reject the argument that the State USF will provide [incumbent local exchange carriers] with a guaranteed level of earningsâ€”in effect, some kind of â€œinsuranceâ€ against competitive loss. State USF funding is portable and, as such, can be competed away just like other sources of customer revenue. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nSECCA and SCCTA also argue the State USF is not competitively neutral because it only allows withdrawal of funds once a local exchange company shows that it has reduced rates to remove implicit subsidies. Therefore, only incumbent local exchange companies can withdraw funds. \r\n \r\nWhile incumbent local exchange companies are initially the carriers of last resort, competitive local exchange carriers may qualify as a carrier of last resort.[21] Â Competitive local exchange carriers are only prohibited from receiving funds from the USF, if they choose not to undertake an obligation to provide universal service.\r\nIV.\r\nSECCA and SCCTA argue the State USF fails to match costs and revenues in violation of Â§ 59-9-280(E)(4), which requires the Commission to establish the size of the fund by calculating the difference between the â€œcosts of providing basic local exchange services and the maximum amount it may charge for the services.â€Â  SECCA and SCCTA contend that because the Commissionâ€™s approach mismatches costs and revenues, the fund will ultimately be oversized.[22] Â Appellantsâ€™ SECCA and SCCTA believe that the fund will become so over-sized that it will serve as a barrier to entry by potential competitors in contravention of the Federal Telecommunications Act.\r\nSECCA and SCCTA have not presented substantial evidence showing that the cost models adopted by the Commission â€œmismatchâ€ costs and revenues in violation of the General Assemblyâ€™s directive.Â  The Commission was specifically required to adopt cost models, which comply with the formula set out by the General Assembly. Â This is precisely what the Commission did, and its decisions on appropriate cost models are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Â Therefore, we give deference to the Commission on this issue. Â In Order No. 98-322, the Commission selected an appropriate cost model and inputs that can produce reasonable cost estimates of providing universal service in South Carolina and that can meet the FCC criteria for calculation of the appropriate level of support from the federal high cost fund.Â  In deciding on the appropriate cost model, the Commission considered the testimony of over thirty experts. Â The Commission carefully analyzed the two models presented to it for consideration.[23] Â In adopting BCPM 3.1, the Commission made a specific finding that HM 5.0a fails to accurately reflect the cost of providing universal service in South Carolina. Â Similarly, it made specific findings on how BCPM 3.1 does accurately reflect the cost of providing universal service in South Carolina.Â  Or. No. 98-322. Â In its order, the Commission gives technical support to its finding and discusses the expert opinions of both sides in detail.[24] \r\n \r\nThe Consumer Advocate makes a similar argument questioning the Commissionâ€™s adoption of certain cost methodologies. Â According to the Consumer Advocate, the Commission violated the Federal Telecom-munications Act because it failed to fully allocate the costs of the local telephone network among all services that use the network. Â Section 254(k) of the Federal Telecommunications Act states,\r\n\r\n\tA telecommunications carrier may not use services that are not competitive to subsidize services that are subject to competition. The Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the States, with respect to intrastate services, shall establish any necessary cost allocation rules, accounting safeguards, and guidelines to ensure that services included in the definition of universal service bear no more than a reasonable share of the joint and common costs of facilities used to provide those services.\r\n\r\nThe Consumer Advocate also argues the Commission violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-280(E)(4) when it allocated the costs of the telephone network to services other than basic local service.\r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record showing the Commission did allocate joint and common costs to different services and did isolate the cost of providing basic local service. Â Witnesses for the SCTC testified that the Commission allocated joint and common costs to the various services using the network.Â  Both the circuit court and Respondents quote the testimony of Azita Sparano[25] and Douglas Meredith[26] extensively. This testimony does reflect the Commission complied with Section 254(k) of the Federal Telecommunications Act. Â Meredith testified,\r\n\r\n\tIn order to develop an embedded cost of service for residential and business one-party service, JSI used information obtained from each cost companyâ€¦.The financial information obtainedâ€¦included booked investment amounts, including depreciation reserves, for investments under [47 C.F.R.] Part 32 Accounting rules. This financial information also included allowable expense amounts for the telecommunications activity of the company.\r\n\tFinally, information relating to the operation of the company that relate to how shared and common investments and expenses are allocated, and the usage of the network for various types of calling activity, was obtained. Â The actual cost information is allocated to department and then to functional components within department based upon the information provided by the company. Â These functional components are then combined to form a basic residential or business service cost. Â This procedure utilizes cost allocation principles that are used in embedded cost methodologies. Â For instance, the switching function is allocated between local and toll calls. Â The only notable exception to an embedded allocation procedure that was used under our analysis is in the treatment of the loop. Â In the current analysis, the loop is fully allocated to the basic service. Â This exception is consistent with the treatment of non-traffic sensitive (â€œNTSâ€) loop cost by the FCC, and is consistent with the treatment used by other companies involved in this proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe trial court also outlines testimony illustrating how the non-rural companies and Sprint/United allocated the costs of the network through inputs to BCPM 3.1. For example, one expert testified as part of the FCCâ€™s Automated Reporting Management Information System, cost data is used to assign only a fraction of the general expense categories. Â Id. Â Furthermore, in Commission Order No. 98-322, the Commission specifically found that BCPM 3.1 and the inputs proposed by BellSouth satisfied the criteria established by the FCC.\r\nThe Consumer Advocate raises another argument related to the cost methodologies in contesting the Commissionâ€™s treatment of the local loop.Â  We agree with the trial court and Respondents the Commissionâ€™s treatment of the local loop as a direct cost was proper. Â The local loop is the transmission facility between the telephone companyâ€™s central office and the end userâ€™s premises. Â 47 C.F.R. Â§ 51.319(a) (2003). Â The trial court explained why the local loop is treated differently. Â Because the local loop is a â€œcost-causer,â€ the entire cost of the loop is appropriately designated to one service. Respondents make a similar argument. Â Opinions on how to treat the local loop costs vary. Â However, treating the loop cost as a direct cost is supported by substantial evidence in the record. \r\n \r\nV.\r\nThe Consumer Advocate alleges that the trial court erred in upholding the Commissionâ€™s finding it was unnecessary to allocate 25% of network costs to the federal jurisdiction. Â Commission Order No. 98-322 explains the origin of this 25% allocation. Â â€œAfter deciding upon a methodology for determining the overall size of universal service costs that required support from a subsidy source, the FCC decided to construct the federal universal service fund to cover only 25 percent of those costs. Â The FCC explained that under the current separations process, roughly 25 percent of the costs of the local loop are assigned to interstate jurisdiction and, therefore, the new federal fund would cover only 25 percent of the total cost of subsidizing universal service.â€ Â Or. No. 98-322.Â  We agree with Respondents that the split to which the Consumer Advocate refers, is not a requirement for USF cost study allocations. Â The Consumer Advocate cites 47 C.F.R. Â§ 36.154(c) (2003) in support of its argument. Â Although, the FCC did adopt a 25/75 split, 47 C.F.R. Â§ 36.154 is not an applicable reference to this split because it refers to an allocation of cost of services between the interstate and intrastate jurisdictions for regulatory purposes.[27] Â The 25% allocation to which Appellants refer was abandoned for universal service funding. \r\n \r\nEven if a 25% allocation is required, the record reflects the Commission did allocate a portion of the cost to the federal jurisdiction by â€œbacking outâ€ federal support from the total USF requirement.Â  Respondents argue the methodologies proposed by the SCTC companies take into account and back out the federal subscriber line charge, which is a direct form of federal support for universal service, as well as the actual amounts received in high cost federal universal service.[28] \r\n \r\nVI.\r\nThe Consumer Advocate argues that the evidence in the record does not support that intrastate access charges are priced above cost and provide a significant implicit subsidy to basic local service.[29] Â Access charges are those paid by long distance companies to local exchange carriers for originating and terminating long distance calls. Â Access charges are a significant source of implicit support for basic local exchange services.Â  The Commission initially reduced access charges by 50% and allowed the recovery of these through the State USF.Â  In effect, the Commission removed a portion of the implicit subsidy and converted it to the explicit USF.\r\nThere is substantial evidence in the record showing that intrastate access charges are priced above cost and provide significant support for basic local exchange service.Â  As Respondents note, BellSouth, GTE, and the SCTC all agree an access rate of three cents is above cost for the companies.\r\nIn issuing Order 98-322, the Commission found the cost of providing service for many companies was shown to exceed the amount the company could charge for the service by $35.07- $70.81 per month. This finding was supported by testimony indicating each company could charge $8.08 to $16.15 per month for basic residential service.Â  The record shows there are subsidies flowing from these rates.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe FCCâ€™s reform of interstate access charges, which reduced access charges and provided explicit support, bolsters Respondentsâ€™ position. Â At the request of the Coalition for Affordable Local and Long Distance Service (CALLS), the FCC adopted a compromise proposal CALLS developed. Â The trial court and Respondents quoted the following language from the FCC order in support of their position illustrating why a reduction in access charges can provide explicit support.\r\n\r\n\tThis â€œpatchwork quiltâ€ of implicit support helped keep rates largely affordable in a monopoly environment where incumbent [local exchange carriers or] LECs could be guaranteed an opportunity to earn returns from certain services and customers that are sufficient to support the high cost of providing other services to customers. Â The new competitive environment envisioned by the 1996 Act, however, threatens to undermine this implicit support structure over the long run. Â The 1996 Act removed barriers to entry in the local market, generating competitive pressures that may make it difficult for incumbent LECs to maintain access charges above economic cost. Â Thus, where existing rules require an incumbent LEC to set access charges above cost for a high-volume user, a competing provider of local service can lease unbundled network elements at cost, or construct new facilities, thereby undercutting the incumbentâ€™s access charges. Â As competition develops, incumbent LECs may be forced to lower their access charges or lose market share, in either case jeopardizing the source of revenue that, in the past, has permitted the incumbent LEC to offer service to other customers, particularly those in high-cost areas, at below-cost prices. Â CALLS Order at para. 24.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellants have failed to show that the Commissionâ€™s decisions in establishing and implementing South Carolinaâ€™s USF are unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Because Appellants have not met their burden of proof, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] After this case was heard, we ordered that the Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS) be substituted for the Consumer Advocate as an appellant and counsel in this matter.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-6-604(C) (Supp. 2006); Rule 236(c), SCACR.Â  \r\n \r\nSection 37-6-604(C) states after January 1, 2005, the Consumer Advocate must not represent consumers in matters or appeals under Title 58 that are pending on January 1, 2005, and such matters shall be transferred to the ORS.Â  Additionally, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-4-10(B) (Supp. 2006) states the ORS must represent the public interest of South Carolina before the Commission and unless and until the ORS chooses not to participate, it must be considered a party of record in all filings, applications or proceedings before the Commission.Â  For purposes of this opinion we refer to the Consumer Advocate, the appellant who initially presented the issues before the Court, but recognize the substitution of ORS as the successor to the Consumer Advocate in Title 58 matters such as this appeal.\r\n[2] Before the Telecommunications Act, universal service was promoted through a system of implicit subsidies.Â  Under the pre-Telecommunications Act plan, incumbent local exchange carriers charged some customers above-cost rates to offset the difference for those customers charged below-cost rates.Â  Congress determined that the system of implicit subsidies stifled competition.Â  Under the â€œimplicit subsidy system,â€ a telephone company agreed to provide services for all customers within its territory.Â  In return, the State promised to set rates that would ensure the telephone company profited from its efforts.Â  Competitors, which were not bound by this agreement with the State, targeted customers who were paying above-cost rates.Â  Consequently, the implicit subsidies that funded universal service were lost when an incumbent local exchange carrier lowered its rates to compete with its competitors or lost its high paying customers, which funded universal service.Â  See In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 98-322 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. May 6, 1998).\r\n[3] Section 58-9-280(E)(4) provides the size of the fund is the sum of the difference, for each carrier of last resort, between its costs of providing basic local exchange services and the maximum amount it may charge for the services.\r\nThe cost models are used to calculate the cost of providing universal service.Â  As explained by the Commission, cost models are needed to determine the size of the implicit subsidy built into current rates that allow incumbent local exchange carriers to sustain low charges for basic services. \r\n \r\n[4] â€œLocal exchange carrierâ€ means either an incumbent local exchange carrier or a new entrant local exchange carrier.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-10(12) (Supp. 2006). \r\n \r\nAn â€œincumbent local exchange carrierâ€ means a telecommunications company, its affiliates, successors, or its assigns, which provide local exchange service pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the commission before July 1, 1995, or operating as a local exchange carrier before that date pursuant to commission authority, to provide local exchange service within a certificated geographic service area of the state.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-10(11) (Supp. 2006). \r\n \r\nâ€œBasic local exchange telephone serviceâ€ means for residential and single-line business customers, access to basic voice grade local service with touchtone, access to available emergency services and directory assistance, the capability to access interconnecting carriers, relay services, access to operator services, and one annual local directory listing (white pages or equivalent). S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-10(9) (Supp. 2006).\r\n[5] Order No. 2001-419 primarily makes public policy findings regarding the fund. The Commission also opted for a phased-in approach from implicit to explicit support. The Order also discusses how the fund operates.Â  Before an incumbent local exchange carrier can qualify for funding from the USF, it must reduce rates containing implicit support, dollar for dollar. \r\n \r\nOrder No. 2001-419 also requires that any local exchange carrier applying for funding from the State USF file detailed cost data with the Commission showing that implicit support exists in the rates that are proposed to be reduced. This is another method by which the Commission maintains sufficient control over the fund.\r\n[6] In re Proceeding to Establish Guidelines for an Intrastate Universal Service Fund, Or. No. 97-942 (S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn. Dec. 31, 1997).\r\n[7] At the time Order No. 98-322 was issued, the FCC had not yet selected a cost model for federal universal service funding, but was considering various proposals.\r\n[8] This demonstrates the Commissionâ€™s intention to fully comply with federal guidelinesâ€”a point Appellants attempt to refute.Â  The Commission was free to develop its own guidelines. \r\n \r\nThe Commission also designated itself to oversee the fund because it found if it did not select a cost model, a federal cost model may not be in South Carolinaâ€™s best interest if this Stateâ€™s amount of federal support was to be determined by a federal model based upon national average default inputs.\r\n[9] The Commission considered highly technical testimony on cost proxy models.Â  It is clear from the record the Commission carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of various models and clearly documented its findings. \r\n \r\n[10] We omit a technical discussion of network design because it is irrelevant to the ultimate issue of whether the Commissionâ€™s findings are supported by substantial evidence.Â  For efficiency purposes, we have selected examples from the record reflecting the Commissionâ€™s thorough evaluation of the cost models.\r\n[11] Respondent South Carolina Telephone Association (SCTA) proposed the guidelines for the fund. Under the SCTA plan, incumbent local exchange carriers reduce prices for intrastate services that include implicit support for universal service to offset the gross amount received from the USF. \r\n \r\n[12] Order No. 2001-419 created the fund and was the first final order. SCCTA and SECCA filed a motion for reconsideration and then filed this appeal.\r\n[13] â€œA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commissionâ€™s rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State.Â  A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent such regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.â€Â  47 U.S.C. Â§ 254(f) (emphasis added).\r\n[14] The Commission initially estimated that the fund would be around $439.7 million, and later lowered that figure to $340 million.\r\n[15] We note our ruling would not preclude future reviews of challenges to the fundâ€™s size.Â  We suggest the Commission engage in periodic review of the fundâ€™s size to enhance the requirements of federal and state law.\r\n[16] A â€œcarrier of last resortâ€ means a facilities-based local exchange carrier, as determined by the Commission, not inconsistent with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, which has the obligation to provide basic local exchange service, upon reasonable request, to all residential and single-line business customers within a defined service area. Initially, the incumbent local exchange carrier must be a carrier of last resort within its existing service area.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-10(10) (Supp. 2006).\r\n[17] 47 U.S.C. Â§ 254(f) states that the mechanisms states adopt cannot burden universal support mechanisms.\r\n[18] The Connecticut Supreme Court has recently stated an overlap in terms of revenues being assessed for both state and federal funds does not suggest that federal funding mechanisms have been relied on or burdened. Bell Atl. Mobile, Inc. v. Depâ€™t of Pub. Util. Control, 754 A.2d 128, 148 (Conn. 2000).\r\n[19] Section 253 of the Telecommunications Act prohibits states from passing regulations which prohibit competitive entry and requires that a stateâ€™s universal service plan be competitively neutral.Â  47 U.S.C. Â§ 253(a) &amp; (b) (2002).\r\n[20] Essentially, the trial court and Respondents argue competitive \r\nlocal exchange carriers seek to delay implementation of the fund because they are not currently subject to implicit support within their rates.Â  Therefore, they can offer services at a lower cost to customers.Â  Under the Commissionâ€™s plan, competitive local exchange carriers would eventually pay into the fund therefore forcing them to increase rates and lose their competitive edge.\r\n[21] The USF is available to carriers who undertake the carrier of \r\nlast resort obligation.Â  See supra note 16 for the meaning of the term â€œcarrier of last resort.â€\r\n[22] Specifically, SECCA and SCCTA argue that the Commissionâ€™s formula uses all costs associated with the facilities used by local exchange companies to provide telecommunications services, but uses revenues received from the provision of only basic local residential and business services.\r\n[23] BellSouth, GTE, and United wanted the Commission to adopt \r\nBCPM 3.1, while AT&amp;T and MCI wanted the Commission to adopt HM 5.0a.\r\n[24] It would be impractical to discuss the scientific findings of the Commission.Â  However, the Commissionâ€™s findings are specific and consistent with a finding of substantial evidence in the record.\r\n[25] Sparano is Director of Southeast Operation of John Staurulakis, Inc. in Alpharetta, Georgia.Â  She was a SCTC witness.\r\n[26] Meredith is the Director of Economic and Pricing Division of \r\nJohn Staurulakis, Inc. in Alpharetta, Georgia.Â  He was a SCTC witness.\r\n[27] 47 C.F.R. Â§ 36.154 (c) states, â€œ[e]xcept as provided in Â§ 36.154(d) through (f), effective January 1, 1986, 25 percent of the costs assigned to subcategory 1.3 shall be allocated to the interstate jurisdiction.â€ Subcategory 1.3 includes â€œ[s]ubscriber or common lines that are jointly used for local exchange service and exchange access for state and interstate interexchange services.â€Â  The Part including these provisions is entitled â€œJurisdiction Separations Procedures; Standard Procedures for Separating Telecommunications Property Costs, Revenues, Expenses, Taxes and Reserves for Telecommunications Companies.â€\r\n[28] Respondents outline how Sprint/United also backed out actual \r\namounts received in universal funding.Â  BellSouth and GTE subtracted the subscriber line charge and an estimate of additional anticipated federal support.\r\n[29] In Order No. 2001-419 the Commission reduced access \r\ncharges by 50% and recovery of that amount from the State USF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
