Harpootlian, of Columbia, for Respondents-Appellants.\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL:Â  In 2006, this Court decided Layman v. State, 368 S.C. 631, 630 S.E.2d 265 (2006), remanding to the\r\n  circuit court the issue of whether a contract existed between the South\r\n  Carolina Retirement System (SCRS) and certain retirees.[1]Â \r\n  This case is an appeal from the circuit court's decision on remand. Â In\r\n  this case, the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System (PORS), the SCRS,\r\n  and the State of South Carolina (collectively, the State) appeal the circuit\r\n  court's order that the State is estopped from collecting retirement\r\n  contributions from the certified class of &quot;old working retirees&quot;\r\n  (Retirees), and that the State must return the contributions withheld from\r\n  those Retirees since July 1, 2005.Â  The State additionally appeals the circuit\r\n  judge's certification of the class of Retirees.Â  Finally, the State argues that\r\n  Retirees failed to exhaust administrative remedies.Â  The Retirees appeal the\r\n  circuit court's holding that no contract existed between the State and the\r\n  Retirees to prevent the State from changing the terms of sections 9-1-1790(A)\r\n  and 9-1-90(4)(a) of the South Carolina Code (the Working Retirees statutes)\r\n  after the employees' retirement.Â  Retirees additionally appeal the circuit\r\n  court's grant of summary judgment on the constitutional issues raised.Â Â  This\r\n  Court consolidated for review the cases brought against the PORS[2] and the SCRS[3] (together, the Retirement Systems), and is reviewing the circuit court order\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case involves the State's\r\n  working retiree program, and the propriety of its withholding retirement\r\n  contributions from eligible Retirement Systems members who returned to covered\r\n  employment with the State prior to July 1, 2005.Â  Prior to this date, the old\r\n  working retiree program allowed employees to retire and then, after a 60 day\r\n  break for SCRS members, and a 15 day break for PORS members, those employees\r\n  could be re-hired at an employer's discretion and receive both retirement\r\n  benefits and a salary up to $50,000 per year, without being required to\r\n  contribute to the Retirement Systems.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 9-1-1790(A) (Supp.\r\n  2001) &amp; 9-11-90(4)(a)Â  (Supp. 2002).Â  In 2005, the State Retirement System\r\n  Preservation and Investment Reform Act (Act 153) amended these statutes to\r\n  require that retired members pay the employee contribution as if they were\r\n  active members, but without accruing additional service credit.Â  2005 S.C. Acts\r\n  153.Â  In filing these actions, the Retirees' chief contention is that it is\r\n  unlawful for the State to change the terms of the old working retiree program\r\n  after the Retirees irreversibly retired, and with the understanding that\r\n  contributions to the Retirement Systems would not be required.\r\nThis Court first considered\r\n  the issue in Layman v. State, 368 S.C. 631, 630 S.E.2d 265 (2006).Â  In\r\n  that case, participants in the Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive Program\r\n  (TERI), along with the Ahrens plaintiffs,[4] brought an action contesting the contribution requirement created by Act 153.Â \r\n  As to the TERI program, this Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding\r\n  that &quot;the language in the old TERI statute demonstrates, in unambiguous\r\n  terms, the intent of the legislature to bind itself to the terms in the\r\n  statute,&quot; and therefore, &quot;[w]hen the State, through Act 153, sought\r\n  to collect retirement contributions from the old TERI participants, it was in\r\n  clear breach of the contract it created by the relevant statutes.&quot; Â Id. at 639-40, 630 S.E.2d at 269.Â  As to the old working retirees statute, this\r\n  Court found the statute\r\ndoes not\r\n  use the same contractually significant language as utilized in the old TERI\r\n  statute.Â  As a result, we hold that the old working\r\n  retiree statute does not create a binding contract between the State and the\r\n  old working retirees prohibiting the State from altering the statute exempting\r\n  old working retirees from further contributions to the retirement system.\r\nId. at 643,\r\n  630 S.E.2d at 272.\r\nStill, the Court found\r\n  evidence in the record that some working retirees may have had written contracts\r\n  detailing the terms of the program, while others who did not have signed\r\n  documents may have relied on statements made by the State when deciding whether\r\n  to retire and enter the working retiree program.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, this\r\n  Court remanded that issue to the circuit court for a &quot;case by case factual\r\n  determination of whether any actions of the State with regard to individual old\r\n  working retirees constituted a breach of contract.&quot; Id. at 643, 630\r\n  S.E.2d at 272-73.\r\nOn remand, the circuit court\r\n  considered whether Election of Non-Membership forms signed by employees\r\n  electing to enter the working retiree program created a contract between the\r\n  State and Retirees.Â  The circuit court found they did not.Â  However, the court\r\n  provided the Retirees equitable relief, ruling the State is estopped from\r\n  changing the terms of the working retirees program for those employees who\r\n  retired prior to July 1, 2005, and further ordering the State to return funds\r\n  previously withheld.[5]Â \r\n  The circuit court also ordered that notice be given to the certified class of Ahrens and Arnold plaintiffs that a judgment has been made in favor of the\r\n  class. [6]Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I. Did the circuit court err in\r\n    holding that no contract exists between the Retirees and the State?\r\n  II. Did the circuit court err in\r\n    ruling that the State is estopped from requiring Retirees to contribute to the\r\n    Retirement Systems?\r\n  III. Did the circuit court err in\r\n    certifying the class of Retirees? \r\n  IV. Did the circuit court err in\r\n    granting summary judgment in favor of the State on the Retirees' causes of\r\n    action for unconstitutional taking, violation of due process, impairment of\r\n    contract, and quantum meruit?\r\n  V. Did the circuit court err in\r\n    denying the State's motion to dismiss based on the State's claim that Retirees\r\n    failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the Claims Procedure Act\r\n    before bringing the dispute to the circuit court?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action seeking damages for\r\n  breach of contract is an action at law.Â  Eldeco, Inc. v. Charleston County\r\n    Sch. Dist., 372 S.C. 470, 476, 642 S.E.2d 726, 729 (2007).Â  However, the\r\n  doctrine of estoppel is equitable in nature. Knight v. Stroud, 212 S.C.\r\n  39, 42-43, 46 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1948).Â  When legal and equitable actions are\r\n  maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for\r\n  purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal.Â  Corley v. Ott,\r\n  326 S.C. 89, 92, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1997).Â  In an action at equity, tried by a\r\n  judge alone, an appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence. Â Inlet Harbour v. S.C. Dep't of Parks,\r\n    Rec. &amp; Tourism, 377 S.C. 86, 91, 659 S.E.2d 151, 154 (2008).Â  However,\r\n  the appellant is not relieved of its burden of convincing the appellate court\r\n  the circuit judge committed error in his findings. Pinkney v. Warren,\r\n  344 S.C. 382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  When an appellate court\r\n  chooses to find facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence, the\r\n  court must state distinctly its findings of fact and the reason for its\r\n  decision. Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369\r\n  (2002).Â  In an action at law tried by a judge, an appellate court's scope of\r\n  review extends merely to the correction of errors of law. Temple v. Tec-Fab,\r\n    Inc., 381 S.C. 597, 599-600, 675 S.E.2d 414, 415 (2009).\r\nANALYSIS\r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a Contract Exists\r\n  Between the State and Retirees\r\nRetirees argue that where the\r\n  statute did not create a contract, the Retirement Systems had the authority to\r\n  &quot;fill up the details&quot; by requiring Retirees sign forms stating they\r\n  would not be required to pay into the Retirement Systems, and in doing so,\r\n  these forms created a contract between the State and Retirees, which was then\r\n  breached when the State began requiring these contributions.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis Court has often\r\n  described a state agency's rulemaking power as its authority to &quot;fill up\r\n  the details&quot; of the laws promulgated by the General Assembly.Â  Heyward\r\n    v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 240 S.C. 347, 355, 126 S.E.2d 15, 19-20 (1962); S.C.\r\n      Hwy. Dept. v. Harbin, 226 S.C. 585, 594, 86 S.E.2d 466, 470 (1955).Â  While\r\n  &quot;[t]he Legislature has the right to vest in the administrative officers\r\n  and bodies of the state a large measure of discretionary authority . . . to\r\n  make rules and regulations,&quot; an agency may not make rules that\r\n  &quot;conflict with, or . . . change in any way the statute conferring such\r\n  authority.&quot; Fisher v. J.H. Sheridan Co., Inc., 182 S.C. 316, 326,\r\n  189 S.E. 356, 360 (1936).Â  Accordingly, an agency does not have the power to\r\n  convert a right that is merely statutory into a contractual right.Â  McKinney\r\n    v. S.C. Police Officers Ret. Sys., 311 S.C. 372, 375, 429 S.E.2d 797, 798\r\n  (1993).Â  \r\nTherefore, to fully address\r\n  Retirees' argument that the Retirement Systems created a contract by filling up\r\n  the details of the statute, it is necessary to examine this Court's basis in Layman for determining that the legislature intended to create a contractual right in\r\n  the TERI statute, but did not intend the same when drafting the Working\r\n  Retirees statutes. \r\nOrdinarily, statutes do not\r\n  create contractual rights.Â  Layman, 368 S.C. at 637, 630 S.E.2d at 268.Â \r\n  In South Carolina, the legislature may only create contractual rights in a\r\n  statute through the express language of the statute. Â Id. at 638, 630\r\n  S.E.2d at 268.Â  This Court found in Layman that the old TERI statute outlined\r\n  the rights and responsibilities of each party. Â Id. at 639, 630 S.E.2d\r\n  at 269.Â  In exchange for the right to lock in a retirement benefit based on the\r\n  average final compensation of the member, &quot;a program participant shall\r\n    agree to continue employment with an employer participating in the system\r\n  for a program period, not to exceed five years.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  9-1-2210(A) (Supp. 2001) (emphasis added).Â  During this term of employment, the\r\n  receipt of retirement benefits was deferred, and placed in a non-interest\r\n  bearing trust account. Â Id. Â§ 9-1-2210(B). Â Â A program participant was\r\n  not required to make any further retirement contributions, accrued no service\r\n  credit, and was not eligible to receive certain employment benefits.Â  Id. Â§ 9-1-2210(D).Â  This Court found the following terms used in the old TERI\r\n  statute as &quot;indicative of a contract: 'A . . . member who is eligible [to retire under TERI] . . . and complies with the requirements of\r\n  this article . . . . shall agree to continue employment . . . .'&quot; Â Layman,\r\n  368 S.C. at 639, 630 S.E.2d at 269 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  9-1-2210(A)) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n\r\n  In contrast, this Court found that the General\r\n    Assembly did not outline the rights and responsibilities of each party in the SCRS\r\n    statute. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1790(A) (Supp. 2001).Â  The SCRS statute\r\n    provided that sixty days after a state employee officially retires, he &quot;may return to employment covered by the system and earn up to fifty thousand\r\n    dollars a fiscal year without affecting the monthly retirement allowance he is\r\n    receiving from the system.&quot; Â Id. (emphasis added).Â  Under this\r\n    statute, an employee's decision to return to work after retiring was optional,\r\n    as was an employer's decision to re-hire that employee.Â  The question of\r\n    whether the PORS statute created a contractual right was not before this Court\r\n    in Layman.Â  However, because the language of the PORS statute is largely\r\n    similar to the SCRS statute, [7]Â we find our analysis of the SCRS statute in Layman to be binding precedent\r\n    with regard to the PORS statute.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, we\r\n  disagree with Retirees' contention that the Retirement Systems filled up the\r\n  details and created binding contracts between the State and Retirees through\r\n  the use of signed forms.Â  The various forms that were required to be signed by\r\n  employees wishing to enter the old working retirees program contained\r\n  substantially the same language:\r\n\r\n  I hereby\r\n    notify you that I am an employee of the State of South Carolina or its\r\n    political subdivisions, and that I meet the requirements not to become a member\r\n    of the South Carolina Retirement System or the Police Officers Retirement\r\n    System, and I hereby exercise my option to become a non-member.\r\n\r\nI take\r\n  this action under the provisions of the Retirement Act with full knowledge that\r\n  I will not be credited with retirement service for this period of employment\r\n  since I have elected non-membership and, as such, will not be making retirement\r\n  contributions.\r\nRetirees argue that the\r\n  language of these forms is contractual in nature and is similar to the language\r\n  used in the TERI statute.Â  However, we believe the language used in the form\r\n  supports the contrary.Â  The form states that the authority to enter the working\r\n  retiree program is derived from &quot;the provisions of the Retirement Act&quot;â€”the\r\n  statute that this Court held in Layman did not create a contractual\r\n  right. Â See Layman, 368 S.C. at 643, 630 S.E.2d at 271. \r\nEven assuming these forms, on\r\n  their own, were binding contracts, we do not believe that the Retirement\r\n  Systems had the authority to create contracts without the statutory directive\r\n  of the legislature.Â  In McKinney v. South Carolina Police Officers\r\n    Retirement System, this Court decided this exact issue. Â 311 S.C. 372, 429\r\n  S.E.2d 797 (1993).Â  In that case, the PORS terminated the plaintiff's\r\n  retirement benefits, finding that the plaintiff did not establish twenty-five\r\n  years of creditable service as required by the statute.Â  On appeal, the\r\n  plaintiff argued that certain correspondence from the Retirement Systems created\r\n  a binding contract entitling the plaintiff to benefits not authorized by the\r\n  statute. Â Id.Â  This Court found that the source of the plaintiff's right\r\n  &quot;is the statutes, not a contract,&quot; and that neither the plaintiff nor\r\n  the PORS &quot;have the authority to convert a statutory right into a\r\n  contractual one.&quot; Â Id. at 375, 429 S.E.2d at 798.Â  Despite the\r\n  dissent's contention that the facts of McKinney do not apply here, we believe\r\n  the important premise that an agency cannot convert a statutory right to a contractual\r\n  right maintains in this case.Â  Any other holding would permit an executive\r\n  agency to usurp the essentially legislative function of amending laws by binding\r\n  the legislature through contract where it had no intention of being bound.Â  We\r\n  cannot support such a result.\r\nAdditionally, in stating\r\n  there is no basis for treating the TERI statute and the Working Retirees\r\n  statutes differently, the dissent overlooks important distinctions that weighed\r\n  heavily on our determination in Layman that the TERI statute created a\r\n  contract and the SCRS statute did not.Â  Employees who retired under TERI were required,\r\n  as a condition of their retirement, to continue employment with an employer\r\n  participating in the TERI system for the program period. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  9-1-2210(A) (Supp. 2001).Â  Importantly, state employees who retired under the\r\n  Working Retirees statutes were not bound by this same obligation.Â  Under those\r\n  statutes, when an eligible employee retired, that employee had the option of\r\n  returning to employment after having retired for sixty days or fifteen days\r\n  (depending on the statute); and even their return was conditioned on whether an\r\n  employer in the system chose to hire that employee.Â  Id.Â  Â§ 9-1-1790(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2001) &amp; 9-11-90(4)(a) (Supp. 2002). Â The dissent claims that the\r\n  Working Retirees statutes constituted a valid offer to eligible participants\r\n  that was then accepted by the signing of Election of Non-Membership forms.Â  We\r\n  respectfully disagree.Â  Because there was no guarantee of re-hire, and because\r\n  these retirees were under no obligation to return to work after retirement, we\r\n  view the language of the Working Retiree statutes as providing a mere option to\r\n  retirees, rather than an offer.Â Â Â  Additionally, the TERI statute specifically\r\n  provided in its text that &quot;a program participant makes no further employee\r\n  contributions into the system.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 9-1-2210(D).Â  The Working\r\n  Retirees statutes are void of this express guarantee that retirement\r\n  contributions would not be required.Â  With an absence of consideration in the\r\n  Working Retirees statutes, these statutes provide no framework to which a\r\n  contractual right can attach.Â  See Alston v. City of Camden, 322 S.C.\r\n  38, 45, 471 S.E.2d 174, 177 (1996) (&quot;South Carolina law is clear that\r\n  public employees generally have no contractual rights in their employment\r\n  merely by virtue of a statute describing the terms of that employment.&quot;).\r\nEstoppel\r\nThe State argues that the\r\n  circuit court erred in holding that the Retirement Systems were estopped from\r\n  applying Act 153 to Retirees because, under these circumstances, estoppel\r\n  cannot lie against the State, and because the Retirees failed to establish the\r\n  elements of equitable estoppel.Â  We agree.\r\nA. Estoppel Against the State\r\nGenerally, &quot;estoppel\r\n  will not lie against a governmental body for the unauthorized acts of its\r\n  officers and agents.&quot;Â  Townes Assoc., Ltd.v. City of Greenville,\r\n  266 S.C. 81, 87, 221 S.E.2d 773, 776 (1976).Â  However, under certain\r\n  circumstances, the State can be subject to the estoppel doctrine.Â  Id.Â \r\n  When agents or officers of a governmental body act within the proper scope of\r\n  their authority, the government &quot;cannot escape liability on a contract\r\n  within its power to make.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the government may\r\n  be estopped in matters that do not affect the exercise of its police power or\r\n  the application of public policy. Â Grant v. City of Folly Beach, 346\r\n  S.C. 74, 81, 551 S.E.2d 229, 232 (2001).Â  \r\nIn determining whether an\r\n  agent of the State acted within its authority, the law is clear that &quot;[a]\r\n  public officer derives his authority from statutory enactment, and all persons\r\n  are in law held to have notice of the extent of his powers, and therefore, as\r\n  to matters not really within the scope of his authority, they deal with the\r\n  officer at their peril.&quot; Â Baker v. State Highway Dep't, 166 S.C.\r\n  481, 490, 165 S.E. 197, 201 (1932), rev'd on other grounds by McCall\r\n    by Andrews v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 349 S.E.2d 741 (1985).\r\nThe record is replete with\r\n  testimony that Retirement Systems agents told Retirees that upon entering the\r\n  working retiree program, they would not be required to make contributions to\r\n  the system.Â  These agents were, no doubt, representing the law as it stood at\r\n  the time. However, even if this Court found that the Retirement Systems and its\r\n  agents made representations that caused the Retirees to prejudicially rely,\r\n  because this Court has ruled that the Working Retiree statute did not create a\r\n  binding contractual right, estoppel cannot lie against the state, as these\r\n  representations were made outside of the agency's authority.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  reverse the circuit court's estoppel holding.\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp;The Elements of Estoppel\r\nAlthough the issue of\r\n  estoppel may be disposed of under the State's first argument, for purposes of clarifying\r\n  the necessary elements to prove estoppel against the government, we address\r\n  this issue and find that Retirees failed to sufficiently prove these elements.Â \r\n  &quot;To prove estoppel against the government, the relying party must prove\r\n  (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the\r\n  facts in question, (2) justifiable reliance upon the government's conduct, and\r\n  (3) a prejudicial change in position.&quot;Â  Grant, 346 S.C. at 80-81,\r\n  551 S.E.2d at 232.Â  In concluding that the State was estopped from requiring\r\n  retirement contributions from Retirees, the circuit court judge applied a six\r\n  element test derived from Brading v. County of Georgetown, 327 S.C. 107,\r\n  114, 490 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1997).Â  Because the Grant elements have been specifically\r\n  applied by this Court to claims against the government, we believe it is the\r\n  appropriate test in this case.\r\nAs to the first element, it\r\n  is uncontested that the Retirement Systems provided forms, brochures and, in\r\n  some cases, made oral statements representing that when the Retirees returned\r\n  to work, they would not be required to make retirement contributions. However,\r\n  it is difficult for Retirees to claim they did not know, or had no means of\r\n  knowing that these terms would ever change.Â  \r\nThe form signed by many of\r\n  the Retirees required them to attest their understanding that the terms of the\r\n  working retiree program derived from the Retirement Act.Â  Since the Retirement\r\n  Act was enacted, the SCRS statute has been amended 29 times and the PORS\r\n  statute 27 times.Â  In fact, several Retirees testified that they were at least aware\r\n  that laws could change, and nearly all of the Retirees whose testimony is\r\n  included in the record stated that they never specifically asked a Retirement\r\n  Systems agent if the law regarding contribution requirements could ever change.[8]Â \r\n  While the majority of amendments to the Retirement Act have afforded working\r\n  retirees more favorable terms, we do not believe this means that more favorable\r\n  terms should be legally expected.Â  Â Â \r\nIn further support that\r\n  Retirees had knowledge that the terms of the Working Retirees statutes could\r\n  change, the Retirement Systems regularly published a pamphlet containing an\r\n  overview of retirement benefits with the following disclaimer:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    information contained in this brochure is meant to serve as a guide, but does\r\n    not constitute a binding representation of the South Carolina Retirement\r\n    Systems.Â  The statutes governing the South Carolina Retirement Systems are\r\n    found in Title 9 of the South Carolina Code of Law, and should there be any\r\n    conflict between this brochure and the statutes, the statutes will prevail.Â  Because\r\n    state statutes are subject to change by the South Carolina General Assembly,\r\n    please contact us for the most current information.\r\n\r\nFinally, even if the Retirees\r\n  were not aware that the terms of the Working Retiree statutes could change,\r\n  &quot;citizens are presumed to know the law and are charged with exercising\r\n  'reasonable care to protect their interests.'&quot; Morgan v. S.C. Budget\r\n    &amp; Control Bd., 377 S.C. 313, 320, 659 S.E.2d 263, 267 (Ct. App. 2008) (quoting Smothers v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 322 S.C. 207, 210-11, 470\r\n  S.E.2d 858, 860 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nSecond, Retirees did not\r\n  prove justifiable reliance on representations made by the Retirement Systems.Â \r\n  The testimony among the named plaintiffs is varied with regard to whether or\r\n  not they would have retired had they known they would be required to make\r\n  retirement contributions without accruing additional service credit.Â  For many\r\n  of the named plaintiffs, the motivating factor for retiring was the promise of receiving\r\n  two sources of income, and they stated they would have retired nevertheless.Â \r\n  Still, others avidly contended that if they had known contributions would be\r\n  required, they would not have retired when they did.[9] Â The presence of reliance in these latter cases, however, is not dispositive unless\r\n  that reliance was justified.Â  Recognizing the well-established rule that\r\n  citizens are presumed to know the law and are charged with using care to\r\n  protect their interests, we find that any reliance created by the\r\n  representations of the Retirement Systems was not justified; especially in\r\n  light of the disclaimers included in the Retirement Systems' distributed\r\n  material, and the Retirees' knowledge that laws are subject to change.\r\nLastly, we find that any\r\n  reliance created by the forms, brochures, or statements of the Retirement\r\n  Systems and its agents did not cause a prejudicial change in position.Â  We\r\n  sympathize with Retirees' argument that if they had continued working as\r\n  non-retired employees, the contributions made to the Retirement Systems would\r\n  have increased the retirement benefits they would eventually receive.Â  However,\r\n  a comparison of the two options, either entering the working retiree program or\r\n  continuing with employment, reveals that the monetary benefit of having five\r\n  years additional service credit is minimal when compared to the effect of\r\n  simultaneously receiving a salary and a retirement allowance.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find that any change in position caused by the alleged misrepresentation was\r\n  not prejudicial to the Retirees.\r\nThe amount of retirement\r\n  allowance that an SCRS retiree receives is set by statute at &quot;one and\r\n  eighty-two hundredths percent of his average final compensation, multiplied by\r\n  the number of years of his credible service.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  9-1-1550(B)(1) (Supp. 2009).[10]Â \r\n  To demonstrate this point, assume that Employee A and Employee B both work for\r\n  the State making $40,000 per year and with 28 years of service credit. Â If\r\n  Employee A becomes a working retiree, during the five year period of the\r\n  program he would receive $101,920 in retirement benefits,[11] in addition to his salary.Â  In the five years after Employee A discontinues\r\n  working he will receive another $101,920 in retirement allowances for a ten\r\n  year total of $203,840 in retirement benefits. Â Under the second scenario,\r\n  Employee B does not retire and accrues five additional years of service credit and\r\n  merit pay increases of two percent per year.Â  With 32 years of service credit\r\n  and an AFC of $44,163, Employee B will receive $128,603 in retirement\r\n  allowances in the five years following retirement,[12] as compared to the $203,840 that Employee A has received in retirement benefits\r\n  up to the same point in time.[13]Â \r\n  In fact, it would take twenty-five years for Employee B to receive a higher\r\n  lifetime retirement benefit than Employee A.Â  In our opinion, a prejudice that\r\n  takes twenty-five years to occur, if at all, does not merit an estoppel\r\n  holding.Â  \r\nTherefore, we do not believe\r\n  the Retirees adequately proved the elements of estoppel.Â  Consistent with our\r\n  holding with regard to estoppel against the state, we reverse the circuit\r\n  court's estoppel order and find that the State is not required to return\r\n  contributions previously deducted.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Certifying the Class\r\nThe State argues that the\r\n  circuit court erred in certifying the class of Retirees for three reasons: (1)\r\n  this Court decertified the class definition that the circuit judge ultimately\r\n  certified, (2) on the merits, the prerequisites of a class action have not been\r\n  satisfied, and (3) class treatment is not appropriate for claims based on estoppel.Â \r\n  Because we conclude that the named plaintiffs have neither a contractual nor an\r\n  equitable remedy, we decline to address these issues.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (appellate court need not address\r\n  remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nIV. Summary Judgment on\r\n  Additional Causes of Action\r\nRetirees argue that the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment to the State on the issues of unconstitutional\r\n  taking, violation of due process, impairment of contract, and quantum meruit.Â \r\n  Claims of unconstitutional taking, violation of due process, and impairment of\r\n  contract are founded on the presumption that a contractual right has been\r\n  unfairly taken away.Â  Because we find that the Retirees did not have a\r\n  contractual right to the terms of their employment, we find it unnecessary to\r\n  address these constitutional issues.Â  See Futch, 335 S.C. at 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d at 598.\r\nFurther, Retirees raised the issue of quantum meruit,\r\n  but failed to argue it in their brief.Â  An issue raised on appeal but not\r\n  argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not be considered by the\r\n  appellate court.Â  State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 86, 276 S.E.2d 163, 170\r\n  (1981).\r\nTherefore, we affirm the circuit court's grant of\r\n  summary judgment on these issues.\r\nV. Exhaustion\r\n  of Remedies\r\nThe State argues that the circuit court lacked the\r\n  statutory authority to hear Retirees' claims because the Claims Procedures Act,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§9-21-10 et seq. (Supp. 2009), provides the\r\n  &quot;exclusive remedy for dispute or controversy between the retirement\r\n  systems and a member . . . arising pursuant to or by virtue of Title 9 of the\r\n  Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-21-30.Â  Because\r\n  we rule in favor of the State on both issues of contract and estoppel, we\r\n  presume that the State will withdraw this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that a contract did\r\n  not exist between the State and Retirees, neither by way of forms signed nor\r\n  representations made.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that summary judgment was\r\n  proper as to the constitutional issues raised by Retirees because those issues\r\n  are premised on the existence of a contract.Â  Additionally, we find the circuit\r\n  court's estoppel holding to be in error.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED\r\n  IN PART.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.Â  HEARN, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:Â  I concur in the majority's resolution of the issues of\r\n  estoppel, class certification, summary judgment as to the additional causes of\r\n  action, and exhaustion of remedies.Â  However, I part company with the majority\r\n  on whether a contract existed and respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the old\r\n  working retirees statutes, together with the mandatory forms signed by the\r\n  working retirees, created a binding contract between the State and the working\r\n  retirees which could not be unilaterally rescinded by the State with the\r\n  passage of Act 153.\r\nIn its simplest terms, a\r\n  contract is formed when a legitimate offer is accepted, accompanied by a\r\n  valuable consideration.Â  Here, the original working retiree statutes permitted\r\n  participants to retire, return to work for the State, and continue to receive their\r\n  retirement.Â  The only retirement contributions required were those by the\r\n  employer:Â  &quot;An employer shall pay to the system the employer contribution\r\n  for active members prescribed by law with respect to any retired member . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1790(B) (as amended through 2004); see also id. Â§ 9-11-90.\r\nThe old working retirees\r\n  statutes thus constituted an offer to eligible program participants to retire,\r\n  be re-hired, and receive their retirement benefits without contributing any\r\n  further payments into the retirement system.Â  While this Court in Layman v.\r\n    State, 376 S.C. 434, 658 S.E.2d 320 (2008), quite rightly found the\r\n  old working retirees statutes did not in and of themselves establish a\r\n  contract, they most certainly constituted a legally significant offer to those\r\n  qualified for the program.\r\nIn order to return to work\r\n  and accept the offer contained in the old working retirees statutes,\r\n  participants were required to sign a form stating their election of\r\n  non-membership in the retirement system.Â  The Participating Employer Procedures\r\n  Manual, published by the South Carolina Retirement Systems, states that &quot;[a]\r\n  service retiree (TERI or non-TERI) . . . must complete an Election of\r\n  Non-Membership (Form 1104) upon returning to work for an employer covered by\r\n  the Retirement Systems.&quot;Â  This mandatory form, entitled &quot;ELECTION OF\r\n  NON-MEMBERSHIP,&quot; stated:Â  &quot;I take this action under the provisions of\r\n  the Retirement Act with full knowledge that I will not be credited with\r\n  retirement service for this period of employment since I have elected\r\n  non-membership and, as such, will not be making contributions.&quot;\r\nWhen signed by the\r\n  participant and his employer, this mandatory form constituted the participant's\r\n  acceptance of the State's offer of re-employment contained in the working\r\n  retirees statutes.Â  The benefits flowing to the State from being able to\r\n  re-hire experienced workers without having them accrue additional retirement\r\n  benefits and the detriment to the participants in foregoing further retirement\r\n  benefits from the State clearly satisfied the requirement of consideration for\r\n  the formation of a binding contract.[14]Â  See McLeod v. Sandy Island Corp, 265 S.C. 1, 13, 216 S.E.2d 746, 751\r\n  (1975) (citing Furman University v. Waller, 124 S.C. 68, 117 S.E.2d 356\r\n  (1923)) (&quot;A valuable consideration may consist either in some right,\r\n  interest, profit, or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance,\r\n  detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.&quot;).\r\nThere is nothing in the form\r\n  which the working retirees had to execute prior to re-hiring that indicates\r\n  their election of non-membership in the retirement system was anything other\r\n  than permanent.Â  Indeed, Peggy Boykin, head of the South Carolina Retirement\r\n  Systems, testified that if &quot;[the working retirees] retired prior to July\r\n  1, 2005, they did not have to make any contributions.&quot;Â  The old adage that\r\n  the proof is in the pudding hits the bulls-eye here, given the undisputed fact\r\n  that not one of the working retirees who executed the form and returned to work\r\n  prior to the passage of Act 153 had any monies taken out of their paychecks.Â \r\n  All partiesâ€”the working retirees, their State employers, and the State\r\n  retirement systemâ€”all recognized that a legally binding contract existed.\r\nAs this Court correctly\r\n  stated in Layman:Â  &quot;Once the bargain is formed, and the obligations\r\n  set, a contract may only be altered by mutual agreement and for further\r\n  consideration.&quot;Â  368 S.C. at 640, 630 S.E.2d at 269.Â  Consistent with Layman,\r\n  I would hold that the State may not unilaterally alter its agreement with the\r\n  working retirees by forcing them to contribute to the retirement system.Â  With\r\n  all due respect to the majority, I cannot, in good conscience, treat the\r\n  working retirees differently than this Court treated the TERI participants in Layman.Â  \r\nNor do I agree with the\r\n  majority's reliance on McKinney v. South Carolina Police Officers Retirement\r\n    System, 311 S.C. 373, 429 S.E.2d 797 (1993), for the proposition that no\r\n  viable contract could be formed through execution of the forms here.Â  McKinney held that certain correspondence from the state retirement system could not\r\n  create a binding contract with the plaintiff for benefits not authorized by the\r\n  statute. Id. at 375, 429 S.E.2d at 798.Â  That is a totally different\r\n  situation than what is presented here where the retirement system generated\r\n  forms to carry out the intent and purpose of the original statutes, and the\r\n  participants were required to execute those forms prior to being rehired.Â \r\n  While I agree with the reasoning expressed in McKinney that mere letters\r\n  from the retirement system could not provide benefits not authorized by\r\n  statute, I am at a loss to see its application to the facts of this case.Â  \r\nConsistent with the\r\n  principles enunciated in Layman, I would hold that the State created a\r\n  binding contract with the working retirees through its unambiguous statutory\r\n  scheme and the participants' execution of mandatory forms which could not be\r\n  altered unilaterally by the State to the detriment of the working retirees.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Nancy Ahrens, Ann Mercer, and Gary McCombs, on behalf of themselves and all\r\n  others similarly situated.\r\n[2] Arnold v. S.C. Police Officers Ret. Sys.,\r\n  No. 05-CP-22-756 (Ct. Comm. Pl., filed June 25, 2009).\r\n[3] Ahrens v. State of S.C. &amp; S.C. Retirement Sys., No. 05-CP-40-2785\r\n  (Ct. Comm. Pl., filed June 25, 2009).\r\n[4] The Arnold plaintiffs initiated a separate lawsuit challenging the\r\n  contribution requirement. \r\n[5] Having found for the plaintiffs with an estoppel order, the circuit court\r\n  declined to reach the additional issues raised.Â  Both the Ahrens and Arnold plaintiffs argued that the State's action in withholding retirement\r\n  contributions was: (1) an unlawful taking, (2) impairment of contract, and (3)\r\n  a violation of due process.Â  In raising these issues, both sets of plaintiffs\r\n  requested injunctive relief.Â  The Arnold plaintiffs additionally argued\r\n  quantum meruit.\r\n[6] By order dated Nov. 17, 2008, Judge Williams certified the Ahrens class\r\n  as the following: &quot;[a]ll persons currently employed by the State of South\r\n  Carolina or its agencies or political subdivisions who retired and returned to\r\n  work prior to July 1, 2005 (&quot;Working Retirees&quot;). Excluded from the\r\n  classes are persons who are participants in the TERI program.&quot; In an order\r\n  dated Nov. 11, 2008, Judge Williams certified the Arnold class with a\r\n  similar class definition.\r\n[7] Section 9-11-90 (4)(a) provides, in pertinent part, &quot;a retired member of\r\n  the system who has been retired for at least fifteen consecutive calendar days\r\n  may be hired and return to employment covered by this system . . . without\r\n  affecting the monthly retirement allowance he is receiving from this\r\n  system.&quot;Â Â  \r\n[8]Â  The record does not include the testimony of all\r\n  23 named plaintiffs.Â  The burden of proving the elements of estoppel, however,\r\n  lies with its proponent.Â  Retirees have not submitted any information that\r\n  precludes the finding that Retirees had knowledge, or the means to gain\r\n  knowledge, that the provisions of the Retirement Act were subject to change.\r\n[9] Nancy S. Ahrens, Ann Mercer, James B. Arnold, Jamie Harrelson, Johnnie R. Deas,\r\n  Dan Furr, and Marion E. White, Jr. all testified to this effect.\r\n[10] The PORS uses a different calculation; however, plugging the PORS denominator\r\n  for a Class Two employee into the following scenario yields similar results. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-11-60(2)(a)-(c) (Supp. 2009).\r\n[11] We assume that the Average Final Compensation (AFC) of Employee A is $40,000,\r\n  and we arrive at this five year retirement allowance total as follows: 28 year\r\n  service credit x .0182 (statutory multiplier) x $40,000 AFC x 5 years.\r\n[12] 32 years x .0182 (statutory denominator) x $45,470 (AFC) x 5 years.\r\n[13] Notably, this demonstration does not take into account cost of living\r\n  adjustments that are calculated each year to increase retirement allowances.Â \r\n  However, these being consistent among each employee, we do not believe it\r\n  substantially affects the analysis.\r\n[14] As stated by Cy Wentworth, the Human Resources Manager for the South Carolina\r\n  Judicial Department, himself a working retiree: &quot;The employee agreed to\r\n  retire and not make any further contributions to the Retirement System and the\r\n  State continued to be able to employ a seasoned, experienced employee for a cost\r\n  which saved the State money.&quot; \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26967","title":"Roe v.

Tiffany, Guardian Ad Litem,\r\n          of Carter Smith Merriam Rogers &amp; Traxler, of Greenville. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:Â  In this case, Craig Reeves (Father)\r\n  claims his consent was necessary prior to another couple adopting his child.Â \r\n  The family court agreed, finding that he met the requirements of Section\r\n  63-9-310(A)(5)(b) of the South Carolina Code (2010) and awarding him custody of\r\n  the child.Â  We find that Father did not undertake sufficient good faith efforts\r\n  to assume parental responsibility and comply with section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b),\r\n  and hold that his consent to the adoption is not required.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  reverse the family court and order that custody be immediately returned to the\r\n  adoptive parents (Appellants).\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFather began a\r\n  sexual relationship with Victoria A. (Mother) in July 2007, when he was\r\n  nineteen years old and she was fifteen.[1]Â \r\n  At that time, Mother already had one son from a previous relationship with\r\n  another man.Â  Mother and Father's relationship was not a stable one.Â  Over the\r\n  next several months, Mother and Father broke up and reconciled several times.Â \r\n  However, in May 2008, Mother, then sixteen years old, discovered she was\r\n  pregnant with Father's child.Â  She first told him that she was pregnant in\r\n  July, at which point he was in a relationship with another woman.Â  His response\r\n  was less than encouraging.Â  He initially texted her, &quot;We dnt hav a baby\r\n  jstop txtn me and sendin me pics.&quot;Â  Approximately twenty-four hours later,\r\n  apparently in response to another text from Mother, Father texted this:\r\n  &quot;Go hav an abortion or sumthn get a life stop txtn me damn.&quot;[2]Â  Although Father maintains he did not\r\n  believe Mother when she told him that she was pregnant,[3] he did not undertake any effort to\r\n  see her or otherwise confirm if she was, in fact, pregnant.\r\nShortly after\r\n  receiving these initial text messages, Mother contacted an adoption agency\r\n  about placing the child for adoption.Â  She settled on Appellants as the\r\n  prospective adoptive parents.Â  From that point on, Appellants drove Mother to\r\n  all of her remaining doctor appointments until the child was born.Â \r\n  Additionally, Appellants made regular payments to the adoption agency for an\r\n  allowance that was distributed to Mother for pregnancy and other miscellaneous\r\n  expenses. However, Mother's medical expenses were covered by Medicaid.Â  During\r\n  the term of her pregnancy, Mother lived at home with her mother and other child.Â \r\n  Her living expenses were covered by her mother and the food stamps they\r\n  received, and were supplemented by the payments made by Appellants through the\r\n  adoption agency.\r\nFather soon learned\r\n  of Mother's plans to place their child up for adoption. Â When he found out, he texted\r\n  her: &quot;If ur putn it w people and ur hapy then f*kn stop begin me 2 cum b\r\n  there its not gna hapn.&quot;Â  Less than a month later, he texted Mother:\r\n  &quot;Leav me tha f*k alone im nt gna txt u bak and I want nothng 2 do w u so\r\n  jus get out mx [sic] life already.&quot;Â  He made no further effort to inquire\r\n  about Mother or their unborn child until November of that year when Mother visited\r\n  Father at his workplace.Â  According to Father, it was only at that time he\r\n  realized she was indeed pregnant.Â  It was then, some five or six months into\r\n  Mother's pregnancy, that Father first informed Mother he wanted custody of the\r\n  child and asked that she stop the adoption.Â  At this point, Mother began having\r\n  some reservations about whether to proceed with the adoption.Â  She changed her\r\n  mind about her decision several times and acknowledged that Father expressed at\r\n  least some desire to raise the child, telling him that she would consider it\r\n  &quot;if he was serious.&quot;Â  When Father asked if he could speak with\r\n  Appellants about calling off the adoption, she refused to give him their names.Â \r\n  However, Father claims Mother told him that he would be able to take the child\r\n  home from the hospital when it was born.\r\nDuring the remainder\r\n  of the pregnancy, Father bought some diapers for Mother's other son and made\r\n  her a one-time offer of $100, which she refused.Â  According to Father, Mother\r\n  would not accept money for their child, but she would accept things for herself\r\n  and her other son.Â  In that vein, he paid eleven dollars for a T-shirt and sweat\r\n  pants for Mother at Old Navy.Â  He did not pay any medical expenses because\r\n  Mother was receiving Medicaid, nor did he pay living expenses because Mother\r\n  lived with her mother and received food stamps.Â  He did gratuitously repair\r\n  Mother's family vehicle, which was owned by her mother.[4]\r\nAt this time,\r\n  Father earned nine dollars per hour plus average monthly commissions of $900\r\n  working at an auto parts store.Â  He also had a second job performing automobile\r\n  repossessions.Â  However, very little of his commissions and none of his income\r\n  from repossessions were reported on his financial declaration.Â  He had $4,000\r\n  in savings[5] and $34,000 in property, which included several cars and motorcycles he planned\r\n  to sell for cash.Â  Although he appears to own most of his vehicles, his car\r\n  payments totaled $500 per month, and he listed an additional $80 per month\r\n  expense just for tires.Â  Like Mother, Father lived at home with his parents.Â \r\n  He anticipated that should he have custody of the child, it would stay with him\r\n  at his parents' house.Â  To that end, he converted some space in his parents'\r\n  house into a nursery and purchased diapers, clothes, blankets, bottles, and\r\n  other similar items.\r\nAfter arranging\r\n  the adoption, Mother had weekly meetings with the adoption agency to evaluate\r\n  her progress.Â  During one of these meetings in January 2009, Mother asked about\r\n  Father's rights as the biological father of the child.Â  One of the agency's\r\n  employees told Mother what state law requires of a biological father and asked\r\n  her whether Father had offered her any support.Â  She told the employee of\r\n  Father's one-time offer of $100, but said that he had made no other offers.Â \r\n  The employee expressed her opinion that the offer was not legally sufficient to\r\n  establish his rights as the father, but she told her to let the agency know if\r\n  he made any more offers.Â  At no point did the agency advise her to not accept\r\n  any offers from Father; in fact, the agency specifically told her to not hide\r\n  from Father.Â  Despite this, she told Father the agency told her to refuse his\r\n  offers of support and that she should not even be speaking to him.\r\nIn March 2009,\r\n  Mother gave birth to a baby boy.Â  Appellants drove Mother to the hospital and\r\n  spent the night with her there.Â  Mother did not contact Father when she went\r\n  into labor, but after their son was born she sent him a text message with a\r\n  picture of the baby, stating that he was &quot;with his parents,&quot;\r\n  referring to Appellants.Â  Father then went to the hospital to see Mother and\r\n  the child, but hospital staff informed him that Mother was a &quot;no\r\n  information&quot; patient and would not accept his visit.Â  When Father\r\n  attempted to get in touch with Mother, she lied and said she was at her\r\n  father's house.Â  The next day, Mother signed an adoption consent form, and Appellants\r\n  took the child home.\r\nVery soon\r\n  thereafter, Father retained an attorney and moved for temporary emergency\r\n  relief.Â  The family court awarded Appellants temporary custody of the child.Â \r\n  Once Father's paternity was established, the court awarded him weekly\r\n  visitation and ordered him to pay child support.[6]Â \r\n  During the period of time prior to the hearing on the issue of Father's consent\r\n  to the adoption, Father exercised his right to visit the child, but he fell\r\n  into arrears on his child support.Â  In fact, it was not until the day before\r\n  the consent hearing that this account was made current.Â  At the hearing, Father\r\n  testified that he &quot;tried to be there&quot; for Mother, but she refused his\r\n  help and said he would never see his child.Â  He also believed that Mother was\r\n  jealous of his new relationship and did not want Father to raise the baby with\r\n  another woman.Â  On the other hand, Mother testified that she never believed\r\n  Father was serious about raising their child and he &quot;had his chance to\r\n  step up . . . and he didn't.&quot;Â  During\r\n  the hearing, both Mother and Father acknowledged that they had not been\r\n  truthful throughout these proceedings.Â  Mother admitted she was untruthful to\r\n  Father, Appellants, the adoption agency, and the guardian ad litem; Father\r\n  admitted he lied in his deposition to make his relationship with Mother appear\r\n  more stable.Â  The family\r\n  court found that Father had undertaken sufficient prompt and good faith efforts\r\n  to assume parental responsibility as required by section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b).Â \r\n  Accordingly, the court found his consent was required for Appellants to adopt\r\n  the child and ordered that the child be returned into Father's custody.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUE PRESENTED\r\nDid the family\r\n  court err in finding Father was required to consent to the adoption of the\r\n  child?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;[A]doptions\r\n  are equitable proceedings, and therefore, the Court has jurisdiction to find\r\n  facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot; Adoptive\r\n    Parents v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C. 535, 542 n.6, 446 S.E.2d 404, 408\r\n  n.6 (1994) (citing S.C. Const. art 5, Â§ 5). Â &quot;This\r\n  broad scope of review does not require the Court to disregard the findings of\r\n  the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility.&quot; McCann v. Doe, 377 S.C.\r\n  373, 382, 660 S.E.2d 500, 505 (2008).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  the family court erred in finding Father undertook a sufficient effort to\r\n  assume parental responsibility.Â  We agree.\r\nThe relationship\r\n  between an unwed father and his child is deserving of constitutional protection\r\n  because the father possess an &quot;opportunity no other male possesses to\r\n  develop a relationship with his offspring&quot; when the child is born. Abernathy\r\n    v. Baby Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 31, 437 S.E.2d 25, 28 (1993).\r\n\r\n  However, this opportunity interest is constitutionally protected\r\n    only to the extent that the biological father who claims protection wants to\r\n    make the commitments and perform the responsibilities that give rise to a\r\n    developed relationship, because it is only the combination of biology and\r\n    custodial responsibility that the Constitution ultimately protects.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Put differently, it is only &quot;[i]f\r\n  he grasps that opportunity and accepts some measure of responsibility for the\r\n  child's future [may he] enjoy the blessings of the parent-child relationship\r\n  and make uniquely valuable contributions to the child's development.&quot; Lehr\r\n    v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248, 262 (1983).Â  Accordingly, section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b),\r\n  provides,\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consent or\r\n    relinquishment for the purpose of adoption is required of the following\r\n    persons:\r\n  . . . . \r\n  (5) Â the father of a child born when the\r\n    father was not married to the child's mother, if the child was placed with the\r\n    prospective adoptive parents six months or less after the child's birth, but only\r\n      if:\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n  (b)Â  the father paid a fair and\r\n    reasonable sum, based on the father's financial ability, for the support\r\n      of the child or for the expenses incurred in connection with the\r\n        mother's pregnancy or with the birth of the child, including, but not\r\n    limited to, medical, hospital, and nursing expenses.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  In enacting section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b), the General Assembly set the\r\n  minimum standards an unwed father must meet in a timely fashion to\r\n  &quot;demonstrate his commitment to the child, and his desire to 'grasp [the]\r\n  opportunity' to assume full responsibility for his child.&quot;[7] Abernathy, 313 S.C. at 32, 437\r\n  S.E.2d at 29 (quoting Lehr, 463 U.S. at 262).Â  An unwed father must\r\n  therefore demonstrate a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood\r\n  by coming forward to participate in the rearing of his child in order for this\r\n  relationship to obtain constitutional protection. Id. at 31, 437 S.E.2d\r\n  at 28.Â  \r\nHowever, we do\r\n  not always require strict compliance with the literal requirements of section\r\n  63-9-310(A)(5)(b).Â  For example, a father's ability to cultivate the sort of\r\n  relationship we recognized in Abernathy can be thwarted by the mother's\r\n  refusal to accept the father's expressions of interest in and commitment to the\r\n  child. Id. at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29.Â  We therefore extend the\r\n  constitutional protection of a father's relationship with his child &quot;not\r\n  only when he meets the literal requirements of section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b), but\r\n  also when he undertakes sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume\r\n  parental responsibility and to comply with the statute.&quot; Id.Â \r\n  Otherwise, a father's constitutional right to form a relationship with his\r\n  child that receives constitutional protection is subject to the whim of the\r\n  mother. Id. at 32-33, 437 S.E.2d at 29.\r\nWe begin our\r\n  analysis by determining whether Mother thwarted Father's efforts to provide for\r\n  her and their child in order to establish the proper standard under which we\r\n  will evaluate Father's contributions.Â  In the case before us, we find that\r\n  Mother has not thwarted Father's attempts to form a relationship with their\r\n  child as was the case in Abernathy.Â  In Abernathy, both the mother and father of the child were on active duty\r\n  in the Navy when they commenced a casual sexual relationship. Id. at 29,\r\n  437 S.E.2d at 27.Â Â  In contrast to Father's actions here, when the mother,\r\n  while she was on leave, informed the father by phone of her pregnancy, he\r\n  begged her not to consider abortion, and she agreed. Id.Â  When the\r\n  mother returned, the father met her at the airport and offered to support her\r\n  and the child. Id.Â  The mother told him they would discuss the situation\r\n  when he returned from sea duty; nevertheless, when the father shipped out, he\r\n  turned over his car and his bank account to the mother. Id. Â While the\r\n  father was at sea, the mother determined she desired no further involvement\r\n  with him. Id.Â  When he returned, she rebuffed his advances and rejected\r\n  his offer of marriage. Id.Â  She thereafter avoided contact with him,\r\n  refused his telephone calls, and basically hid away from him. Id.Â  When\r\n  the father later learned of the birth and the pending adoption action, he\r\n  sought to intervene and assert his parental rights. Id. at 30, 437\r\n  S.E.2d at 27.Â  Under these compelling facts, this Court rightly concluded that\r\n  literal compliance with the predecessor to section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b) was not\r\n  necessary. Id. at 32-33, 437 S.E.2d at 29.\r\nThe facts of this case bear\r\n  little resemblance to those presented in Abernathy.Â Â  Here, Father not\r\n  only advised Mother to have an abortion and stop bothering him when he was\r\n  initially told of her pregnancy, he also told her several weeks later that if\r\n  she was happy with giving up the baby for adoption, that was fine with him.Â  It\r\n  was when Mother was five or six months into her pregnancy and went to visit\r\n  Father that he told her he wanted to raise the child, and he claims Mother told\r\n  him that when the child was born, he would be able to take him home from the\r\n  hospital.Â  It was not until the child was born that Mother prevented Father\r\n  from seeing the child and went through with the adoption.Â  During her entire\r\n  pregnancy, the only support Mother refused was Father's one-time offer of\r\n  $100.Â  Beyond that, the record contains no evidence Mother actually hid herself\r\n  from Father or refused his assistance.Â  If this is sufficient to constitute\r\n  thwarting, the exception to literal compliance with the requirements of section\r\n  63-9-310(A)(5)(b) has swallowed up the rule.Â  \r\nThe situation before us therefore\r\n  falls far short of the extraordinary factual scenario presented in Abernathy which prompted this Court to require less than literal compliance with the\r\n  statutory provision in question.[8]Â \r\n  Given that Father was an adult at the time this child was conceived, we are not\r\n  persuaded he would have been so easily thwarted in his efforts to assume his\r\n  parental responsibilities by this sixteen-year-old girl who did not hide from\r\n  him as in Abernathy, but continued to live in the same house\r\n  throughout her pregnancy and delivery.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals of Kansas summed up an unwed father's obligation as follows:\r\n\r\n  He must\r\n    [provide support] regardless of whether his relationship with the mother-to-be\r\n    continues or ends.Â  He must do this regardless of whether the mother-to-be is\r\n    willing to have any type of contact with him whatsoever or to submit to his\r\n    emotional or physical control in any way. . . .\r\n  Even in\r\n    the most acrimonious of situations, a father-to-be can fund a bank account in\r\n    the mother-to-be's name.Â  He can have property or money delivered to the mother-to-be\r\n    by a neutral third party.Â  He canâ€”and mustâ€”be as creative as necessary in\r\n    providing material assistance to the mother-to-be during the pregnancy\r\n    and, the law thus assumes, to the child once it is born.Â  He must not be\r\n    deterred by the mother-to-be's lack of romantic interest in him, even by her\r\n    outright hostility.Â  If she justifiably or unjustifiably wants him to stay\r\n    away, he must respect her wishes but be sure that his support does not remain\r\n    equally distant.\r\n\r\nIn re Adoption of M.D.K., 58 P.3d 745, 750-51 (Kan. Ct. App. 2002) (Beier, J.,\r\n  concurring) (emphasis added).Â  The thwarting recognized by this Court in Abernathy is far more severe than that referenced in the above-quoted passage from Adoption\r\n    of M.D.K.Â  In order for an unwed father to be thwarted, the mother must be\r\n  more than acrimonious or hostile; she must actively hide and avoid the father's\r\n  attempts to provide support.Â  However, the situation before us today is more\r\n  akin to that referenced in Adoption of M.D.K., not what occurred in Abernathy.Â  Accordingly, Mother did not sufficiently\r\n  thwart Father's efforts to establish a relationship with his child such that\r\n  literal compliance with section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b) is excused.Â  \r\n\r\nWe turn now to whether Father\r\n  has complied with the statutory requirements.Â  Section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b)\r\n  clearly &quot;conditions the necessity of a father's acquiescence in an\r\n  adoption on his payment of support or financial assistance to the birth mother.&quot; Ex parte Black, 330 S.C. 431, 435, 499 S.E.2d 229, 231 (Ct. App. 1998).Â \r\n  It is not enough that the father simply have a desire to raise the child; he must\r\n  act on that interest and make the material contributions to the child and the\r\n  mother during her pregnancy required of a father-to-be.Â  Accordingly, a father's\r\n  attempts to assert his parental rights are insufficient to protect his\r\n  relationship with the minor child &quot;unless accompanied by a prompt,\r\n    good-faith effort to assume responsibility for either a financial\r\n  contribution to the child's welfare or assistance in paying for the birth\r\n  mother's pregnancy or childbirth expenses.&quot; Id. (emphasis added).Â \r\n  According to Father, it was only when Mother appeared at his place of work in\r\n  November 2008 that he realized she was indeed pregnant; moreover, he then\r\n  ostensibly realized that she had not followed his advice to have an abortion.Â \r\n  However, even assuming arguendo that Father's initial responses to news\r\n  of Mother's pregnancy and her decision to place the child for adoption were\r\n  excusable, his actions to assume parental responsibility beginning in November\r\n  2008 were still insufficient to require his consent under our adoption\r\n  statute.Â  Even taking Father's testimony as true, we find that he did not pay\r\n  &quot;a fair and reasonable sum . . . for the support of the child or for\r\n  expenses incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy or with the birth\r\n  of the child.&quot;\r\nFirst, Father's payments and\r\n  purchases for Mother's older child and the repairs made to her mother's car are\r\n  not within the purview of section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b).Â  Payments made to other\r\n  children in the family or repairs to the vehicle of the grandmother, which was\r\n  not a necessary support for the pregnancy because the adoptive parents drove\r\n  Mother to her doctor appointments, are not embraced by the statute and should\r\n  not be considered.Â  Furthermore, Father's actions in setting up a nursery at\r\n  his parents' homeâ€”when the child already had a place to sleep at Mother's\r\n  should he not reside with Appellantsâ€”and legal fees he incurred to challenge\r\n  the adoption likewise are not valid considerations under the statute.Â  Similar\r\n  to the payments for Mother's older child and the repairs to her mother's\r\n  vehicle, these expenditures are not for &quot;the support of the minor\r\n  child&quot; or &quot;expenses incurred in connection with mother's pregnancy or\r\n  with the birth of the child&quot; as required by section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b).\r\nFather testified he paid\r\n  eleven dollars for a T-shirt and sweatpants for Mother.Â  This single payment\r\n  represents the sole expenditure by Father which complies with section\r\n  63-9-310(A)(5)(b), assuming these clothing items were related to the pregnancy.Â \r\n  He paid no medical expenses for Mother because she was on Medicaid, and did not\r\n  pay any living expenses because Mother lived with her mother and received food\r\n  stamps.Â  However, this does not excuse Father from contributing more than\r\n  eleven dollars towards Mother's pregnancy.Â  Simply because she was receiving\r\n  some government benefits to cover her basic needs does not relieve Father of\r\n  his obligation to provide for Mother during her pregnancy.Â  Indeed, Appellants\r\n  contributed regularly to Mother during her pregnancy despite the availability\r\n  of these benefits.Â  Even if Mother had accepted Father's offer of $100, the\r\n  resulting $111 contribution would still be inadequate, especially in light of\r\n  the money Father spent on himself during Mother's pregnancy; the payments\r\n  Father made for tires on his car alone far exceeded that amount.\r\nThe record does not support\r\n  the conclusion that Father undertook a sufficient effort to make the sacrifices\r\n  fatherhood demands.Â  Father had the means and opportunity to provide more, but he\r\n  simply chose not to and to rely on others to provide for Mother.Â  Even though\r\n  she rebuked some of his efforts, that did not alleviate or in any way mitigate\r\n  his obligation. See Adoption of M.D.K., 58 P.3d at 750-51 (Beier, J.,\r\n  concurring).Â  The fact that he now wishes to raise his son does not overcome\r\n  his lack of support and contribution while Mother was carrying his child or\r\n  after he was born.Â  In short, he did not fully &quot;grasp [the] opportunity&quot;\r\n  to come forward and demonstrate a full commitment to the responsibilities of\r\n  parenthood through prompt and good faith efforts.Â  We accordingly hold that\r\n  Father's contributions were not sufficient compliance with the statute to\r\n  establish his right to consent to the adoption of this minor child.[9]Â \r\n  Although we are not unmindful of the findings of the learned and able family judge\r\n  in this case, our review of the record compels us to find that Father has not\r\n  met the requirements imposed by section 63-9-310(A)(5)(b).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  reverse the order of the family court requiring Father's consent to the\r\n  adoption of this child.Â  Appellants are to obtain immediate custody of the\r\n  child.\r\nTOAL, C.J. and KITTREDGE,\r\n  J., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BEATTY,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the family\r\n  court correctly determined Father's consent was required for the adoption of\r\n  the child because Father demonstrated sufficient and prompt good faith efforts\r\n  to assume parental responsibility such that his literal compliance with Â§\r\n  63-9-310 (A)(5)(b) should be excused.\r\nIn appeals\r\n  concerning adoption proceedings, as in any appeal from family court, this Court\r\n  may find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  McCann v. Doe, 377 S.C. 373, 382, 660 S.E.2d 500, 505\r\n  (2008).Â  This broad scope of review does not require the Court to disregard the\r\n  findings of the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in\r\n  a better position to evaluate their credibility.Â  Id. Â \r\nI disagree with the\r\n  majority's conclusion that Mother did not thwart Father's attempts to form a\r\n  relationship with the child because she did not actually hide herself and the\r\n  only financial support she rejected was Father's &quot;one-time offer of\r\n  $100.&quot;Â  In my opinion, the family court correctly found Mother thwarted\r\n  Father's attempts to provide financial support based on the adoption agency's\r\n  advice about birth father's rights.Â  The majority states Father made Mother a\r\n  one-time offer of $100, which she refused.Â  Father's testimony, however,\r\n  contradicted this.Â  Father testified he offered Mother money &quot;a lot&quot;\r\n  but that Mother told him the agency advised her not to accept any offers of\r\n  support or even speak to him.Â  Father testified Mother would accept money for\r\n  herself and her other son but wouldn't accept anything &quot;immediately for\r\n  [the child].&quot;Â  After assessing the credibility of the witnesses, the family\r\n  court found Mother refused Father's offers of support based on the agency's\r\n  advice about birth father's rights.Â  Although we may find the facts in accordance with our own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence, we are not required to disregard the findings of\r\n  the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate their credibility.\r\nFurther, the majority focuses\r\n  solely on the financial considerations that are to be made in determining\r\n  whether a father's consent is required.Â  In doing so, the majority fails to\r\n  recognize Father's offers of non-financial support.Â  &quot;The United States Supreme Court has\r\n  recognized that an unwed father may\r\n  possess a relationship with his child that is entitled to constitutional\r\n  protection.&quot;Â  Abernathy at 31, 437 S.E.2d at 28 (citing Stanley\r\n    v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972)).Â  However, â€œparental rights do not spring full-blown from the biological\r\n  connection between parent and child. Â They require relationships more enduring.â€Â  Id. (quoting Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248, 260 (1983)). Â Thus, an unwed father must demonstrate a full\r\n  commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by coming forward to\r\n  participate in the rearing of his child before his interest in personal contact\r\n  with his child acquires substantial constitutional protection. Â Id. Â The\r\n  mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional\r\n  protection. Â Id.Â Â  \r\nIn my view, the\r\n  constitutional protection afforded Father by virtue of his demonstrated\r\n  commitment to the child far outweighs his failure to literally comply with the\r\n  requirements of the statute.Â  The majority states the facts favorable to Father\r\n  in this case do not rise to the level of those in Abernathy.Â  The Abernathy Court considered not only father's offers of financial support, but also took\r\n  into account the fact that father did not seek legal advice about how to\r\n  protect his paternal interests because of mother's assurance that she would not\r\n  place the child for adoption.Â  Abernathy at 33, 437 S.E.2d at 29.Â  The\r\n  Court also noted the father &quot;immediately manifested his willingness to\r\n  assume sole custody of the child once he discovered adoption proceedings had\r\n  commenced.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nTurning to the facts of the\r\n  present case, once Father realized Mother was actually pregnant, he immediately\r\n  manifested his willingness to raise the child.Â  Father pleaded with Mother to\r\n  stop the adoption process, even offering to call Appellants to discuss the\r\n  matter.Â  Father also relied on Mother's misrepresentations to him on several\r\n  occasions that she would not go through with the adoption.Â  In fact, Father\r\n  believed he would be able to take the child home from the hospital after its\r\n  birth. Â The record also clearly shows that Mother used the adoption process as\r\n  leverage to try to lure Father back.Â  \r\nThe majority focuses on\r\n  distinguishing the facts of the present case from the &quot;extraordinary\r\n  factual scenario&quot; presented in Abernathy.Â  Although Abernathy is the seminal case on this issue, it is not the only case where the Court has\r\n  determined a father was not required to literally comply with the statute.Â  In Doe\r\n    v. Queen, 347 S.C. 4, 552 S.E.2d 761 (2001), the factual scenario presented\r\n  certainly did not reach that of Abernathy.Â  We nonetheless affirmed the\r\n  family court's ruling that the father demonstrated sufficient prompt and good\r\n  faith efforts to assume parental responsibility such that his literal\r\n  compliance with the statute was excused.Â  In that case, the mother lied to the\r\n  father and told him she had an abortion after he tried to convince her to keep\r\n  the child.Â  Queen at 6, 552 S.E.2d at 762.Â  The mother also signed a\r\n  criminal warrant against the father, which resulted in a bond condition that\r\n  father have no contact with the mother.Â  Id.Â  The father was notified of\r\n  the child's birth in November, approximately two months after the child was\r\n  born.Â  Id.Â  When the adoptive parents requested the father sign the\r\n  consent forms, the father obtained an attorney, but did not file responsive\r\n  pleadings until the day of the hearing the next August.Â  Id.Â  The father\r\n  began saving money, prepared a nursery, and arranged for medical insurance for\r\n  the child.Â  Id.Â  We found the father's failure to provide support during\r\n  the mother's pregnancy was no fault of his own, and that the father's actions\r\n  subsequent to learning of the child's birth demonstrated sufficient prompt and\r\n  good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility.Â  Queen at 9, 552\r\n  S.E.2d at 764.Â  If the father's actions in Queen constituted sufficient\r\n  prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility, then Father\r\n  has surely exceeded that standard here.Â  In my view, the father in Queen did very little to support his child after learning of its birth.Â  Here, Father\r\n  exercised regular visitation and paid child support, in addition to preparing a\r\n  nursery.\r\nMoreover, in focusing on\r\n  distinguishing the present case from Abernathy, the majority fails to\r\n  recognize the numerous cases in our jurisprudence where our courts have\r\n  determined the father's consent was not required.Â  These cases are, in my\r\n  opinion, instructive owing to their contrast with the factual scenario under\r\n  consideration.Â  See Doe v. Roe, 369 S.C. 351, 631 S.E.2d 317 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (father's contributions to mother were insubstantial and inconsistent,\r\n  mother never refused father's help but, rather, requested it, mother attempted\r\n  to reach father on several occasions but he avoided her); Arscott v. Bacon,\r\n  351 S.C. 44, 567 S.E.2d 898 (Ct. App. 2002) (mother informed father she had\r\n  given birth, and even with this direct information from mother, father still\r\n  did not believe that she had ever been pregnant and had given birth, and father\r\n  did nothing, despite knowing that mother had a child and he could be the\r\n  father); Parag v. Baby Boy Lovin, 333 S.C. 221, 508 S.E.2d 590 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998) (father could have sought the exact location of his child and could have\r\n  made efforts to cultivate a relationship with the child three months prior to\r\n  taking any action; father never offered any financial support to mother in\r\n  connection with the expenses of her pregnancy and birth; and father never\r\n  offered any financial support for the child after learning of his birth); and Ex parte Black,\r\n  330 S.C. 431, 499 S.E.2d 229 (Ct. App.1998) (assuming unwed father took prompt\r\n  measures to determine paternity and assert parental rights after biological\r\n  mother informed father of child's existence, where father failed to offer to\r\n  support child or assist in medical expenses, his consent to adoption was not\r\n  required). \r\nIn my opinion, the present\r\n  case is distinguishable from those cases in which our courts have determined a\r\n  father's consent was not required.Â  Mother never requested assistance from\r\n  Father, but rather, told him she did not want to &quot;mess up the\r\n  adoption&quot; by accepting money from him.Â  After the child's birth, Father\r\n  showed his commitment to the child by immediately moving for temporary relief,\r\n  preparing a nursery, regularly exercising his visitation rights, and paying\r\n  child support.Â  Father also offered to reimburse Appellants for all of their\r\n  expenses incurred during Mother's pregnancy.\r\nIn my opinion, Father timely\r\n  demonstrated his willingness to develop a relationship with his child and\r\n  therefore acquired constitutional protection.Â  I would therefore affirm the\r\n  family court's finding that Father's consent was required and find that custody\r\n  of the child should remain with the Father.\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Father and Mother never lived together during their\r\n  relationship or Mother's subsequent pregnancy.\r\n[2] Father stated in an affidavit to the family court\r\n  that he offered to pay for an abortion.\r\n[3] During the course of their rocky relationship, Mother\r\n  would use various excuses in an attempt to win Father back.Â  For example, she told\r\n  Father that her other son missed him, her cousin was in a car accident, and her\r\n  grandfather was dying.Â  Father therefore testified he initially believed\r\n  Mother's pregnancy was another ruse to rekindle their relationship.\r\n[4] Had this work been performed at an automobile repair\r\n  shop, Father estimated it would have cost approximately $750.\r\n[5] His savings were not reported on his financial\r\n  declaration, but rather in the report from the guardian ad litem.\r\n[6] Appellants refused to accept money from Father\r\n  directly and requested that he pay the child support into the court.\r\n[7] Section 63-9-310(A)(5)(a) does not condition the\r\n  necessity of the unwed Father's consent on financial contributions.Â  That\r\n  section provides his consent is required where he openly lived with the mother\r\n  or the child for a period of at least six months immediately preceding the\r\n  adoption and he openly held himself out as the child's father during\r\n  this time. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-9-310(A)(5)(a).Â  Because the child was placed\r\n  with Appellants immediately after his birth and Father and Mother never lived\r\n  together, this section does not apply. \r\n[8] Even if we were to agree with the dissent that the\r\n  father in Doe v. Queen, 347 S.C. 4, 552 S.E.2d 761 (2001), did less to\r\n  assume parental responsibility than Father in this case, the dissent loses\r\n  sight of the fact that the father in Queen was thwarted and was held to\r\n  a lower standard.&nbsp; Because Father here was not thwarted, he must literally\r\n  comply with the statute.\r\n[9] Father argues that his payment of child support per\r\n  the family court's order is per se reasonable under the statute.Â  Father's\r\n  argument ignores that he understated his income on his financial declarations\r\n  and was in arrears on the payments until the day before the hearing.Â  We\r\n  therefore decline to reach whether, in a proper case, payment of child support\r\n  is per se reasonable.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26968","title":"Compton v.

however, the matter was handled internally, so no charges\r\n  were filed against him when he returned.Â  In 1995, Compton went AWOL again, but\r\n  he was not returned to SCDC's custody until 2002 when he was apprehended while\r\n  hiding in North Carolina.Â  An arrest warrant and indictment were issued for\r\n  Escape under Section 24-13-410 of the South Carolina Code (2002), but the\r\n  charge was nol prossed after the State twice failed to appear before the\r\n  grand jury.Â  The circuit court in Spartanburg County issued an order in 2005\r\n  for the destruction of the arrest warrant records and indictment in connection\r\n  with the 1995 incident.\r\nSCDC's Inmate Classification\r\n  Summary Report currently contains the following notations pertaining to\r\n  Compton's escape history in what Appellants call his &quot;Escape Screen&quot;:\r\n\r\n   Escapes\r\n  10/13/95Â Â Â Â  Other\r\n    Escape Related Code Not in Table\r\n    09/21/77Â Â Â Â  Other\r\n    Escape Related Code Not in Table\r\n\r\nCompton's criminal history in\r\n  the report references the charges for which he was incarcerated in addition to\r\n  crimes he committed while he was AWOL, but it does not mention anything regarding\r\n  the escapes themselves.Â  Under the heading &quot;History of Movements,&quot;\r\n  the report reflects that he was &quot;ESCAPED-AWOL&quot; from 1995 through\r\n  2002.Â  Additionally, the report notes an &quot;Escape&quot; in 1982 under the\r\n  heading &quot;History of Earned Work Credit Assignments.&quot;Â  SCDC maintains\r\n  that it keeps records of these movements, regardless of whether there was an\r\n  associated criminal prosecution, for security and classification purposes.[2]Â \r\n  Compton currently is eligible for parole, and SCDC forwards all of this\r\n  information to DPPPS for Compton's parole hearings.Â  During these hearings, DPPPS\r\n  has questioned Compton specifically about his escape history.Â  To date, DPPPS\r\n  has not granted Compton parole.\r\nCompton brought the instant\r\n  declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that SCDC has failed to\r\n  comply with the order to destroy the records of his 1995 escape and any\r\n  reference to his escapes must be destroyed pursuant to Section 17-1-40(A) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2003 &amp; Supp. 2010).Â  Compton subsequently filed a\r\n  motion for contempt and injunctive relief, requesting the court hold Appellants\r\n  in contempt for not complying with the destruction order and order them to\r\n  &quot;destroy all evidence of the three charges remaining on his SCDC\r\n  record&quot; and prevent the dissemination of this evidence to other state\r\n  agencies, in particular DPPPS, under section 17-1-40(A).Â  The circuit court\r\n  found Appellants were not in willful violation of any court order and\r\n  accordingly denied Compton's motion for contempt.Â  As to the records, the court\r\n  found the 1977 and 1995 entries are maintained for security and classification\r\n  purposes and therefore are not subject to &quot;complete destruction&quot;\r\n  under section 17-1-40(A).Â  However, the court enjoined Appellants from\r\n  forwarding information regarding the 1995 escape to DPPPS based on its reading\r\n  of the statute.Â  The court also found there was no 1982 charge in SCDC's\r\n  records that it could enjoin Appellants from forwarding to DPPPS.Â  On Compton's\r\n  motion to alter or amend, the court extended its order to cover the 1977 flight\r\n  as well.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court\r\n  erred in granting Compton a preliminary injunction because Compton cannot show\r\n  a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim.[3]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe purpose of a preliminary\r\n  injunction is to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable harm to the\r\n  party requesting it. Powell v. Immanuel Baptist Church, 261 S.C. 219,\r\n  221, 199 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1973).Â  An applicant for a preliminary injunction must\r\n  allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for injunction and\r\n  demonstrate that this relief is reasonably necessary to preserve the rights of\r\n  the parties during the litigation. County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348\r\n  S.C. 664, 669, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Accordingly, the applicant\r\n  must establish three elements to receive this relief: (1) he will suffer\r\n  immediate, irreparable harm without the injunction; (2) he has a likelihood of\r\n  success on the merits; and (3) he has no adequate remedy at law. Scratch\r\n    Golf Co. v. Dunes W. Residential Golf Props., Inc., 361 S.C. 117, 121, 603\r\n  S.E.2d 905, 908 (2004).Â  Appellants' challenge to the injunction concerns the\r\n  second element, whether Compton has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the\r\n  merits.[4]\r\nWhether to grant a\r\n  preliminary injunction is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and\r\n  will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. Atwood Agency v.\r\n    Black, 374 S.C. 68, 72, 646 S.E.2d 882, 884 (2007).Â  In evaluating whether\r\n  a plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction, the court must examine the\r\n  merits of the underlying case only to the extent necessary to determine whether\r\n  the plaintiff has made a sufficient prima facie showing of entitlement to\r\n  relief. Helsel, 307 S.C. at 32, 413 S.E.2d at 826.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  circuit court's analysis was limited to only whether Compton's complaint stated\r\n  a prima facie case that SCDC violated the provisions of section 17-1-40(A) and\r\n  Compton will be immediately and irreparably harmed.\r\n\r\n  Section\r\n    17-1-40(A) provides, in pertinent part, \r\n  A person\r\n    who after being charged with a criminal offense and the charge is discharged,\r\n    proceedings against the person are dismissed, or the person is found not guilty\r\n    of the charge, the arrest and booking record, files, mug shots, and\r\n    fingerprints of the person must be destroyed and no evidence of the record\r\n      pertaining to the charge may be retained by any municipal, county, or state law\r\n      enforcement agency.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-1-40(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).Â  Appellants do not argue Compton has failed to\r\n  make a prima facie showing of his entitlement to relief for Appellants'\r\n  purported violation of this statute.Â  Instead, they argue that based on the\r\n  circuit court's determination the records are not subject to complete\r\n  destruction, the plain language of section 17-1-40(A) contains no further\r\n  restriction on their use and Compton's claim must fail.Â  However, Appellants misconstrue\r\n  the nature of the inquiry.Â  The court must determine only the likelihood of whether Compton will prevail on the merits based on the allegations in his\r\n  complaint, not whether these records actually are subject to destruction.Â \r\n  Therefore, their reliance on the court's determination regarding the\r\n  destruction of the records is misplaced.Â  Compton's complaint alleges he was\r\n  never convicted of the 1977 fugitive from justice charge or the 1995 escape\r\n  charge.Â  He further alleges there is an order expunging the 1995 charge from\r\n  his records.Â  Nevertheless, SCDC keeps a record of those events in Compton's\r\n  file.[5]Â \r\n  Based on a plain reading of the statute, Compton argues Appellants have failed\r\n  to comply with it because these are records pertaining to criminal charges that\r\n  were not destroyed despite the fact that the proceedings against him all have\r\n  been dismissed.Â  Compton further alleges he will be immediately and irreparably\r\n  harmed by Appellants' actions because DPPPS will continue to deny him parole\r\n  based on his escape history.Â  Indeed, a transcript of a recent parole hearing\r\n  for Compton shows DPPPS specifically questioning him about the 1995 incident.\r\nWe find the circuit court's\r\n  conclusion that Compton has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits\r\n  of his claim is not clearly erroneous.Â  The statute plainly prohibits the retention\r\n  of any evidence pertaining to the charge once it has been dismissed or there has\r\n  been an acquittal.Â  The notations regarding the 1977 and 1995 escapes on the\r\n  Escape Screen appear to be related to the fact that there were charges filed\r\n  for each of those incidents.Â  Importantly, the Escape Screen contains no\r\n  mention of the 1982 escapeâ€”for which no charges were filedâ€”while that incident\r\n  is reflected elsewhere on the report.Â  Compton has also alleged he will\r\n  continue to be denied parole so long as DPPPS receives this information.Â  In\r\n  fact, Appellants do not appear to argue Compton will not suffer immediate,\r\n  irreparable harm.Â  Therefore, we can find no clear error in the conclusion\r\n  Compton has made out a prima facie case that SCDC has violated the plain language\r\n  of the statute and will suffer immediate, irreparable harm.Â  Accordingly, he\r\n  has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and the circuit court\r\n  did not err in granting preliminary injunctive relief.[6]\r\nWhat remains to be determined\r\n  is the scope of the injunction.Â  Because the sole authority for Compton's\r\n  complaint is section 17-1-40(A), the injunction granted by the circuit court\r\n  will extend only as far as that section does.Â  Section 17-1-40(A) applies only\r\n  to &quot;evidence of the record pertaining to the charge,&quot;\r\n  including but not limited to the arrest and booking records, files, mug shots,\r\n  and fingerprints. (emphasis added).Â  It therefore does not apply to any\r\n  recordation of historical events beyond the charge itself.Â  For example, the facts\r\n  precipitating the charge are not covered by this statute because they are mere\r\n  events that exist irrespective of any criminal proceedings.Â  As applied to the\r\n  instant case, the distinction drawn under section 17-1-40(A) is the distinction\r\n  between &quot;capital-e Escape&quot;â€”a criminal chargeâ€”and &quot;lower-case-e\r\n  escape&quot;â€”a mere fact that a person was AWOL.Â  Section 17-1-40(A) prohibits\r\n  the retention, and by extension the dissemination, of the former; it contains\r\n  no restrictions with respect to the latter.Â  Based on our conclusion above that\r\n  Compton has stated a prima facie case that the notions on his Escape Screen are\r\n  related to the charges filed against him in 1977 and 2002, Appellants are\r\n  enjoined from forwarding this information to DPPPS.Â  However, Appellants are\r\n  not enjoined from forwarding any notations of historical events to DPPPS, such\r\n  as the fact that Compton was AWOL, found under Compton's &quot;History of\r\n  Movements&quot; and &quot;History of Earned Work Credit Assignments.&quot;Â  We\r\n  express no opinion as to whether the information on Compton's Escape Screen actually\r\n  is evidence pertaining to the criminal charges filed in connection with those\r\n  incidents under section 17-1-40(A).Â  We merely hold that because Compton has\r\n  stated a prima facie case that it is, the preliminary injunction will cover\r\n  this information.\r\nAppellants argue an\r\n  injunction preventing them from disseminating this information prevents them\r\n  from exercising their statutory duty to forward information to DPPPS. See\r\n    Frady v. Student Loan Servicing Ctr., 313 S.C. 561, 564, 443 S.E.2d 580,\r\n  582 (Ct. App. 1994) (&quot;[O]ne may not generally enjoin a state agency from\r\n  the performance of duties imposed by valid statute . . . .&quot;).Â  Section\r\n  24-21-70 of the South Carolina Code (2007) requires Appellants to &quot;keep a\r\n  record of the industry, habits, and deportment of the prisoner, as well as\r\n  other information requested by [DPPPS] and furnish it to them upon\r\n  request.&quot;Â  We find no conflict.Â  Section 24-21-70 speaks broadly to a\r\n  prisoner's conduct as it relates to his &quot;industry, habits, and\r\n  deportment,&quot; which does include the existence of legal proceedings such as\r\n  criminal charges.Â  A prisoner absenting himself from a prison (commonly\r\n  referred to as an escape) is a fact that exists regardless of whether charges\r\n  are filed in connection with it, which certainly falls within the ambit of the\r\n  prisoner's &quot;deportment.&quot;Â  Because the injunction we affirm today only\r\n  enjoins the dissemination of records pertaining to criminal charges and not\r\n  historical facts, Appellants are not enjoined from forwarding information they\r\n  have a statutory duty to send to DPPPS.[7]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we affirm the order of the circuit court as modified.Â  In doing so, we\r\n  express no opinion as to section 17-1-40(A)'s ultimate application to the\r\n  information contained in Compton's records.Â  Until the circuit court determines\r\n  the merits of Compton's claim, Appellants are enjoined from forwarding the notations\r\n  on Compton's Escape Screen to DPPPS, but they are not enjoined from forwarding\r\n  historical evidence of Compton's movements.Â  When the court makes such a\r\n  determination, it will be done with no reference to the order of the circuit\r\n  court before us today.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The suit names Jon Ozmint, Director of SCDC; David\r\n  Tatarsky, General Counsel for SCDC; and James Brennan, Assistant Division\r\n  Director of Inmate Records for SCDC as parties.Â  The State Law Enforcement\r\n  Division and its director, Robert Stewart, also were parties originally, but they\r\n  were dismissed in 2007.\r\n[2] SCDC's policies provide that an escape history will\r\n  dictate to which level of institution an inmate will be assigned.\r\n[3] At oral argument, attorneys for the parties took the\r\n  position that the circuit court's order was a decision on the merits of\r\n  Compton's claims.Â  However, despite the parties' belief as to the scope of the\r\n  circuit judge's ruling, she acknowledged on the record at the hearing that the\r\n  case would not be concluded upon her decision, but rather would continue for a\r\n  hearing on the merits.Â  Further, a decision on the merits at this procedural\r\n  juncture would be erroneous. See Helsel v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 307\r\n  S.C. 29, 32, 413 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1992) (stating that a preliminary injunction\r\n  &quot;is made without prejudice to the rights of either party pending a hearing\r\n  on the merits,&quot; and the merits &quot;are determined without\r\n  reference&quot; to the preliminary injunction at trial); Transcontinental\r\n    Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 481, 167 S.E.2d 313, 315\r\n  (1969) (&quot;It is well settled that, in determining whether a temporary\r\n  injunction should issue, the merits of the case are not to be considered,\r\n  except in so far as they may enable the court to determine whether a prima\r\n  facie showing has been made.Â  When a prima facie showing has been made\r\n  entitling plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be granted\r\n  without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits.&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we decline to reach Appellants' and Compton's arguments regarding\r\n  the merits of section 17-1-40(A)'s applicability.\r\n[4] Appellants also argue the court erred in not balancing\r\n  the equities in this case.Â  However, we recently announced that balancing the\r\n  equities is no longer a requirement for a preliminary injunction. Poynter\r\n    Invs., Inc. v. Century Builders of Piedmont, Inc., 387 S.C. 583, 586, 694\r\n  S.E.2d 15, 17 (2010).\r\n[5] Whether SCDC is a law enforcement agency for purposes\r\n  of section 17-1-40(A) is not before us.Â  The parties all seem to agree SCDC\r\n  falls within the ambit of the statute.\r\n[6] Appellants argue the circuit court erred in awarding\r\n  any relief at all because DPPPS is a necessary party under Rule 19(a), SCRCP,\r\n  who was not joined.Â  However, Appellants never moved for DPPPS to be joined\r\n  under Rule 19, and the only time they made a &quot;motion&quot; to dismiss on\r\n  this ground was in their memorandum in opposition to Compton's motion for\r\n  contempt and injunctive relief.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court never addressed\r\n  this argument, and Appellants did not file a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Therefore,\r\n  this issue is not preserved for review.Â  See Duncan v. CRS Sirrine Eng'rs,\r\n    Inc., 337 S.C. 537, 543-44, 524 S.E.2d 115, 119 (Ct. App. 1999)\r\n  (&quot;[H]is contentions are not preserved for appeal because Duncan failed to\r\n  plead the issue, failed to raise the issue to the circuit court, the circuit\r\n  court failed to rule on the issue, and Duncan failed to file a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP motion.&quot;).\r\n[7] We do note that section 24-21-70 also requires\r\n  Appellants to forward &quot;other information requested by&quot; DPPPS beyond\r\n  just the industry, habits, and deportment of the prisoner.Â  To the extent this\r\n  would permit DPPPS to request Appellants to forward a record of a prisoner's\r\n  criminal charges, section 24-21-70 presupposes those records validly exist in\r\n  the prisoner's file.Â  If they must be destroyed by virtue of section\r\n  17-1-40(A), then no obligation arises to forward them under 24-21-70.Â  At this\r\n  stage in the proceedings, Compton has shown a likelihood of success on the\r\n  merits that the entries on his Escape Screen must be destroyed.Â  It is\r\n  therefore appropriate to enjoin Appellants from forwarding this information\r\n  until it can be determined at a final hearing whether they actually must be\r\n  destroyed in order to prevent irreparable harm to Compton.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26969","title":"In the Matter of Michael Hensley Wells","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26969","description":"This is an opinion publicly reprimanding a lawyer.","date":"2011-05-09","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          In the Matter\r\n          of Michael Hensley Wells, Respondent.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26969\r\nHeard April 7, 2011 - Filed May 9, 2011\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara\r\n          M. Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of\r\n          Disciplinary Counsel.Â  \r\n        Kevin Mitchell Barth, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Commission\r\n  on Lawyer Conduct (&quot;Commission&quot;) investigated allegations of\r\n  misconduct involving Michael Hensley Wells's (&quot;Respondent's&quot;) use of\r\n  a website, brochures, and telephone book advertisements to promote his law\r\n  firm's services.Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) filed Formal\r\n  Charges against Respondent. Â A Hearing Panel of the Commission (&quot;Hearing Panel&quot;)\r\n  issued its Panel Report, finding Respondent had committed misconduct. Â A\r\n  majority of the Panel recommended that this Court issue a Public Reprimand.[1] Â The Panel also recommended that this Court order Respondent to pay costs, pay\r\n  a fine, and complete the Ethics School and the Advertising School of the Legal\r\n  Ethics and Practice Program.\r\nNeither Respondent nor the\r\n  ODC has filed a brief taking exception to the Panel Report.Â  We accept the\r\n  Panel's recommendation.Â  Accordingly, we issue a Public Reprimand and order\r\n  Respondent to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings, pay a fine in the\r\n  amount of $1,000, and complete the Ethics School and the Advertising School of\r\n  the Legal Ethics and Practice Program administered by the South Carolina Bar.\r\nI.  Factual/Procedural History\r\nRespondent, who was admitted to the South Carolina Bar\r\n  on April 24, 2001, owns and operates a law firm doing business under the name\r\n  Coastal Law, L.L.C.Â  This matter arises from the marketing practices used by\r\n  Respondent's law firm as of January 2009.Â  At that time, Respondent employed\r\n  two associates, both of whom were admitted to practice in 2007.Â  The law firm's\r\n  marketing consisted primarily of a website, telephone book advertisements, and\r\n  a firm brochure distributed at various public locations that included a mall\r\n  kiosk.Â  \r\nFollowing a full investigation, the ODC filed Formal\r\n  Charges against Respondent on February 25, 2010, alleging seven matters of\r\n  misconduct involving his law firm's advertising practices. Â In his Answer,\r\n  Respondent conceded certain allegations, but asserted that he did not intend to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. \r\nOn July 15, 2010, the Panel held a hearing on the\r\n  Formal Charges.Â  At the hearing, Respondent testified regarding the allegations\r\n  of misconduct.Â  Although he acknowledged the improper statements in his\r\n  advertising material, he claimed it was an &quot;honest mistake&quot; and that\r\n  he had not intended to be deceptive.Â  He further explained that he had failed\r\n  to oversee the creation of the advertisements. Â He also emphasized that he had\r\n  corrected and revised the advertising materials after being apprised of the\r\n  Rule violations.Â  He maintained that he now reviews all of the firm's\r\n  advertisements before they are disseminated.Â  In addition, Respondent offered\r\n  evidence of his good character.Â  \r\nOn December 22, 2010, the Hearing Panel issued a\r\n  report that was filed with the Commission the next day. Â In its report, the\r\n  Panel found the following facts[2] regarding the allegations of misconduct:\r\nAllegation A\r\nIn his advertising materials,\r\n  Respondent included false and misleading statements regarding: Â his experience\r\n  and his associates' experience; the firm's areas of practice and past case\r\n  results; the assignment of cases among the attorneys in the firm; the firm's\r\n  reputation; the firm's office locations; and the foreign language ability of the\r\n  firm's employees.\r\nIn terms of his experience, Respondent\r\n  included a statement on his website and in his firm brochure that he had\r\n  &quot;worked in the legal environment for over twenty years.&quot;Â  Although\r\n  Respondent had worked as a clerk for a law firm while in college and law\r\n  school, he had only actually practiced law for about seven years when these\r\n  materials were disseminated.\r\nRespondent also overstated\r\n  the experience of his associates on his website.Â  At the time the website was\r\n  published, the firm's two associates had been admitted for less than one year,\r\n  yet the website referred to the firm's &quot;numerous trained and experienced\r\n  attorneys.&quot;Â  The website also included phrases describing the firm's\r\n  attorneys as &quot;thoroughly familiar with the local court system&quot;,\r\n  &quot;highly skilled&quot;, possessing &quot;wide-ranging knowledge&quot;, and\r\n  having a &quot;deep personal knowledge of the courts, judges, and other\r\n  courthouse personnel.&quot;\r\nRegarding the firm's areas of\r\n  practice and the types of cases handled by the attorneys, Respondent's website\r\n  included a statement that &quot;our attorneys handle all types of legal matters\r\n  in state and federal court in South Carolina&quot; when, in fact, that was not\r\n  the case.Â  The website also stated that the firm represents clients &quot;in\r\n  every level of the South Carolina state court system&quot;, which was not true.\r\nRespondent's website also stated\r\n  that &quot;[e]ach attorney with Coastal Law Firm focuses his or her practice\r\n  exclusively on one area of the law [thus] each attorney is deeply familiar with\r\n  the law and procedural issues related to their clients' cases.&quot;Â  However,\r\n  Respondent listed at least twenty-seven distinct practice areas on his website\r\n  even though only three attorneys (including himself) were employed with the\r\n  firm.\r\nRespondent's website further stated\r\n  that the firm had served clients in constitutional law, civil rights, ethics\r\n  and professional responsibility, and toxic torts.Â  No lawyer in the firm had\r\n  actually handled any matters in those areas; however, they were willing to\r\n  accept such cases. \r\nAdditionally, Respondent's\r\n  website contained a page entitled &quot;Consumer Protection and Products\r\n  Liability Lawyer.&quot;Â  The page claimed that the firm has &quot;a history of\r\n  winning [products liability] cases&quot; and that it employs &quot;defective\r\n  products liability lawyers&quot; who &quot;understand how to deal with both\r\n  corporations and insurance companies and have a history of winning cases for\r\n  our clients.&quot;Â  On another page on the website, Respondent stated that\r\n  &quot;At Coastal Law, our . . . product recall lawyers understand what is\r\n  required in filing a medical injuries claim for manufacturer negligence in\r\n  producing a hazardous drug or product leading to a dangerous product recall.Â \r\n  We can aggressively pursue your legal rights against negligent corporations\r\n  that may have introduced a product that damaged your health.&quot;Â  Neither\r\n  Respondent nor any lawyer in his law firm had ever handled a products liability\r\n  matter.\r\nIn terms of the firm's office\r\n  locations, some of Respondent's telephone book advertisements stated that the\r\n  firm had offices in Georgia and Florida.Â  At the time, Respondent had a referral\r\n  arrangement with firms located in those states and had plans to merge his firm\r\n  with another South Carolina lawyer, who had offices in Georgia and Florida.Â \r\n  Respondent's firm, however, never actually operated offices in those states.\r\nWith respect to the foreign\r\n  language ability of the firm's employees, Respondent's advertising materials\r\n  included the phrase &quot;We Speak Spanish&quot; written in Spanish.Â  None of\r\n  the lawyers in the firm spoke Spanish.Â  Only part of the time when these\r\n  advertisements were published did the firm employ a staff member who spoke\r\n  Spanish.Â  The inclusion of &quot;We Speak Spanish&quot; in Respondent's\r\n  advertising, particularly at times when no one in the office spoke Spanish, was\r\n  misleading as it implied that the firm employed Spanish- speaking attorneys.\r\nAs to the firm's reputation, Respondent's\r\n  website included a number of statements that could not be factually\r\n  substantiated such as the firm &quot;developed a reputation over the years for\r\n  outstanding results&quot; and the firm is &quot;recognized as an established,\r\n  experienced, and reputable local Myrtle Beach law firm.&quot;Â  Although Respondent\r\n  admitted at the hearing that the inclusion of this language was a &quot;mistake&quot;\r\n  as his law firm had not been identified as a leading law firm or received\r\n  special recognition, he claimed it was never his &quot;intention to\r\n  deceive.&quot; \r\nAllegation B\r\nIn his advertising materials,\r\n  Respondent improperly compared his law firm's services to other law firms in\r\n  ways that could not be factually substantiated with statements such as\r\n  &quot;best attorney available&quot;, &quot;most effective legal services&quot;,\r\n  and &quot;best services possible.&quot; Respondent acknowledged that it was\r\n  inappropriate to make these comparisons to other lawyers.\r\nAllegation C\r\nAlthough Respondent filed his\r\n  telephone book advertisements with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct in compliance\r\n  with Rule 7.2(b), he admitted that he did not do so with his website or firm\r\n  brochure.\r\nAllegation D \r\nRespondent admitted that some\r\n  of his telephone book advertisements listed only the law firm name and not the\r\n  name of a lawyer that was responsible for the content of the advertisements.\r\nAllegation E\r\nRespondent admitted in his Answer that his firm\r\n  brochure characterized the quality of his firm's legal services for criminal\r\n  defense clients as &quot;tough criminal defense representation.&quot;Â  He also\r\n  admitted that his website characterized his firm's attorneys as:Â  &quot;highly\r\n  skilled at obtaining bonds for their clients&quot;; &quot;dedicated attorneys\r\n  who provide excellent legal advice&quot;; &quot;maintaining a high degree of\r\n  professionalism&quot; in real estate matters; and &quot;intelligent&quot;,\r\n  &quot;competent&quot;, and &quot;full service.&quot;\r\nAllegation F\r\nRespondent admitted that his\r\n  telephone book advertising and website included statements regarding contingent\r\n  fee arrangements, including the following statements:Â  &quot;no fee until you\r\n  receive money&quot;; &quot;no fees up front to handle your personal injury or\r\n  wrongful death case&quot;; and &quot;your cost is nothing unless we win.&quot;Â \r\n  Respondent, however, failed to disclose whether the client would be liable for any\r\n  expenses in addition to the fee or whether the percentage of the contingency\r\n  fee would be computed before deducting the expenses.\r\nAllegation G\r\nRespondent's website referred\r\n  to the firm's &quot;expertise&quot; in personal injury matters and the firm's\r\n  &quot;expert nursing home litigation advisors.&quot; Â The website and firm\r\n  brochures also stated that the firm &quot;specializes in several areas of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Respondent, however, admitted that no one in his firm was a\r\n  certified specialist in any area of law.\r\nHearing Panel's Findings of Misconduct\r\nThe Hearing Panel found that\r\n  by his conduct, Respondent was subject to sanctions for violating the following\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) of Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule\r\n  7.1(a) (communications concerning a lawyer's services that contain &quot;a\r\n  material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make\r\n  the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading&quot;); Rule\r\n  7.1(b) (communications concerning a lawyer's services that are &quot;likely to\r\n  create an unjustified expectation about results the lawyer can achieve, or\r\n  states or implies that the lawyer can achieve results by means that violate the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct or other law&quot;); Rule 7.1(c) (communications\r\n  concerning a lawyer's services that compare &quot;the lawyer's services with\r\n  other lawyers' services, unless the comparison can be factually substantiated&quot;);\r\n  Rule 7.2(b) (&quot;A lawyer is responsible for the content of any advertisement\r\n  or solicitation placed or disseminated by the lawyer and has a duty to review\r\n  the advertisement or solicitation prior to its dissemination to reasonably\r\n  ensure its compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct&quot;; failure to\r\n  file advertisements with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct)[3];\r\n  Rule 7.2(d) (&quot;Any communication made pursuant to this Rule shall include\r\n  the name and office address of at least one lawyer responsible for its content.&quot;);\r\n  Rule 7.2(f) (&quot;A lawyer shall not make statements in advertisements or\r\n  written communications which are merely self-laudatory or which describe or\r\n  characterize the quality of the lawyer's services; provided that this provision\r\n  shall not apply to information furnished to a prospective client at that person's\r\n  request or to information supplied to existing clients.&quot;); Rule 7.2(g) (&quot;Every\r\n  advertisement that contains information about the lawyer's fee shall disclose\r\n  whether the client will be liable for any expenses in addition to the fee and,\r\n  if the fee will be a percentage of the recovery, whether the percentage will be\r\n  computed before deducting the expenses.&quot;); and Rule 7.4(b)[4] (use of the words &quot;expert&quot; and &quot;specialist&quot; in\r\n  advertisements is prohibited where a lawyer is not a certified specialist). \r\nAggravating and Mitigating Circumstances\r\nThe Hearing Panel took into\r\n  consideration the following mitigating circumstances:Â  (1) Respondent's\r\n  character evidence; (2) the absence of any prior disciplinary history; (3)\r\n  Respondent's acknowledgement of wrongdoing; and (4) Respondent's remorse and\r\n  willingness to take remedial action.Â  In aggravation, the Panel took into\r\n  consideration the seriousness of Respondent's misconduct, in particular the\r\n  dishonest nature of the conduct, and the fact that these charges represented a\r\n  pattern of multiple offenses.Â  \r\nHearing Panel's Recommended Sanction\r\nTwo members of the Hearing\r\n  Panel recommend the sanction of a Public Reprimand.Â  The remaining member of\r\n  the Hearing Panel recommended the sanction of an Admonition.Â  Additionally, all\r\n  members of the Hearing Panel recommended that Respondent be ordered to pay the\r\n  costs of the proceedings, be fined an appropriate amount, and be required to\r\n  complete the Ethics School and the Advertising School of the Legal Ethics and\r\n  Practice Program within a period of six months from the date of this Court's\r\n  order.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nThis Court has the sole\r\n  authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the appropriate sanction after\r\n  a thorough review of the record.Â  In re Welch, 355 S.C. 93, 96, 584\r\n  S.E.2d 369, 370 (2003).Â  &quot;The Court is not bound by the panel's\r\n  recommendation and may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law.&quot;&nbsp; In re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102,\r\n  106&nbsp;(2008).\r\n&quot;A disciplinary\r\n  violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;&nbsp; In re\r\n    Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see also Rule\r\n  8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall be\r\n  established by clear and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the\r\n  charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.&quot;).\r\nThe parties, by not filing\r\n  briefs, have accepted the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\n  recommendations of the Hearing Panel. Â Thus, this Court must determine whether\r\n  the recommended sanction is appropriate.\r\nWe agree with the Panel's\r\n  recommended sanction of a Public Reprimand as it is consistent with this\r\n  Court's decisions regarding similar professional misconduct.Â  See In re\r\n    Schmidt, 374 S.C. 167, 648 S.E.2d 584 (2007) (holding that Public Reprimand\r\n  was the appropriate sanction where attorney: Â published newspaper\r\n  advertisements that failed to disclose the location, by city or town, where he\r\n  principally practiced law; used advertisements containing the word\r\n  &quot;specialist&quot;, when in fact he was not a certified specialist; sent\r\n  solicitation letters that failed to disclose where he principally practiced\r\n  law, included the words &quot;expert&quot; and &quot;expertise&quot;, were not filed\r\n  with the Commission, and did not disclose a list of persons to whom the letters\r\n  were sent; and sent a client letter containing statements that were not\r\n  verified); In re Mitchell, 364 S.C. 606, 614 S.E.2d 634 (2005) (finding\r\n  Public Reprimand was the appropriate sanction where attorney, who had\r\n  previously received a letter of caution, continued to use letterhead that contained\r\n  misleading information regarding his solo practice); In re Pavilack, 327\r\n  S.C. 6, 488 S.E.2d 309 (1997) (concluding Public Reprimand was the appropriate\r\n  sanction where attorney aired two misleading advertisements); cf. In re\r\n    Anonymous Member of the South Carolina Bar, 386 S.C. 133, 687 S.E.2d 41\r\n  (2009) (issuing a letter of caution with a finding of minor misconduct where\r\n  attorney's use of the words &quot;expert&quot; and &quot;specialist&quot; on\r\n  his firm's website violated Rule 7.4(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct); In\r\n    re Creson, 338 S.C. 157, 526 S.E.2d 231 (2000) (finding a Public Reprimand\r\n  was warranted for attorney who failed to remove from his South Carolina\r\n  letterhead a misleading statement indicating that he was admitted to practice\r\n  in Georgia but had been suspended from the practice of law in that state).\r\nHere, Respondent was clearly cooperative\r\n  and remorseful as evidenced by his testimony before the Hearing Panel and this\r\n  Court.Â  Respondent also has no prior disciplinary history and has revised his advertising\r\n  materials in accordance with the suggestions made by the ODC.Â  Moreover,\r\n  according to Respondent, the advertising materials were corrected almost\r\n  immediately after he received the ethics complaint in January 2009.Â  \r\nIn terms of the website,\r\n  Respondent testified that the website was &quot;actually up&quot; for only\r\n  three to four months as it became operational at the end of 2008 and was taken\r\n  down shortly after he received the ethics complaint in January 2009.Â  Respondent\r\n  also testified that he &quot;pulled all the brochures and business cards&quot;\r\n  from the mall kiosk that had been set up for the firm's advertisements.Â  \r\nFinally, Respondent stated\r\n  that he now uses a &quot;checklist&quot; compiled by the ODC to help attorneys\r\n  with their advertisements.Â  He further explained that he has &quot;scaled&quot;\r\n  back on the statements in his advertisements as to the firm's areas of practice\r\n  and the potential case results. Â \r\nIn addition to the\r\n  above-outlined sanction, we also order Respondent to pay a fine of $1,000 and the\r\n  costs of the disciplinary proceedings.[5]Â  See In\r\n    re Thompson,&nbsp;343 S.C. 1, 13, 539 S.E.2d 396, 402 (2000) (&quot;The\r\n  assessment of costs is in the discretion of the Court.&quot;); Rule 27(e)(3),\r\n  RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;The Supreme Court may assess costs against the\r\n  respondent if it finds the respondent has committed misconduct.&quot;); Rule\r\n  7(b)(6), RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR\r\n  (stating sanctions for misconduct may include the &quot;assessment of the costs\r\n  of the proceedings, including the cost of hearings, investigations,\r\n  prosecution, service of process and court reporter services&quot;); Rule\r\n  7(b)(7), RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR (providing that sanctions for misconduct may\r\n  include assessment of a fine).\r\nMoreover, given the extent of\r\n  Respondent's improper advertisements, we order Respondent to complete the Ethics\r\n  School and the Advertising School of the Legal Ethics and Practice Program.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that Respondent\r\n  has committed misconduct in the respects identified by the Hearing Panel.Â  We\r\n  further find the Hearing Panel's recommended sanctions are warranted under the\r\n  circumstances.Â  Accordingly, we issue a Public Reprimand and further order\r\n  Respondent to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings, pay a fine in the\r\n  amount of $1,000, and complete the Ethics School and the Advertising School of\r\n  the Legal Ethics and Practice Program administered by the South Carolina Bar\r\n  within six months of the date of this order.Â Â Â Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  One member of the Panel recommended an Admonition.\r\n[2]Â  Neither party filed briefs with this Court.Â \r\n  Consequently, the parties are deemed to have accepted the Panel's findings of\r\n  fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations.Â  See Rule 27(a), RLDE, of\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;The failure of a party to file a brief taking exceptions\r\n  to the report constitutes acceptance of the findings of fact, conclusions of\r\n  law, and recommendations.&quot;).\r\n[3]Â  Respondent's advertisements were subject to filing\r\n  pursuant to Rule 7.2(b), which was amended effective October 1, 2005.Â  As of\r\n  June 28, 2010, the rule has been amended to eliminate this filing requirement.\r\n[4]Â  Although the Panel Report references Rule 7.4(c), we\r\n  believe Rule 7.4(b) is the proper rule as Rule 7.4(c) addresses advertisements\r\n  regarding patent and trademark attorneys.\r\n[5] Â The Commission claims it has incurred $1,005.24 in\r\n  these proceedings.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26970","title":"Simmons v.

Tinkler and Joshua P.

Simmons, 370 S.C. 109, 634 S.E.2d 1\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The court found that the Social Security Act, specifically 42\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 407(a) (2010), preempted and expressly\r\n  precluded the parties' agreement to divide Rubin's Social Security benefits.Â \r\n  As a result, the court voided that portion the agreement.\r\nAt the time of\r\n  the 1990 agreement, both parties believed Social Security benefits could be equitably\r\n  divided as property.Â  Essentially, the parties proceeded under a mutual mistake\r\n  regarding the ability to equitably apportion Social Security benefits.Â  \r\nBecause the\r\n  parties' agreement had been voided in part, Essie sought to reopen the matter\r\n  in its entirety, including equitable division and alimony.Â  The family court granted\r\n  Rubin's motion to dismiss, holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  to revisit the parties' agreement, even that part declared void by the court of\r\n  appeals.Â  Essie sought reconsideration, relying in part on Rule 60(b)(5),\r\n  SCRCP, which provides for relief from judgment when &quot;the judgment has been\r\n  â€¦ discharged â€¦ or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the\r\n  judgment should have prospective application.&quot;Â  Essie's motion to\r\n  reconsider was denied, and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nII.\r\nIn appeals from\r\n  the family court, this Court reviews factual and legal issues de novo.Â  Rutherford\r\n    v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992) (noting the authority to\r\n  review factual findings and legal conclusions without deference to the family\r\n  court); Inabinet v. Inabinet, 236 S.C. 52, 55, 113 S.E.2d 66, 67 (1960)\r\n  (&quot;Our duty in equity cases [is] to review challenged findings of fact as\r\n  well as matters of law . . . .&quot;).Â  \r\n\r\nIII.\r\nThe court of\r\n  appeals' interpretation of section 407(a)â€”Congress precluded Social Security\r\n  benefits from being assigned as part of an equitable division of marital\r\n  propertyâ€”is the law of the case.Â  We find, however, that the family court\r\n  committed an error of law by determining that it did not have subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  It appears the family court's primary focus of concern was the\r\n  passage of time, not its lack of authority to equitably apportion a marital\r\n  estate upon dissolution.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530 (2010) (stating the family court has jurisdiction over\r\n  &quot;divorce . . . and for settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the\r\n  parties in the actions in and to the real and personal property of the marriage\r\n  . . . .&quot;).Â Â Â  \r\nUnder these\r\n  circumstances, we hold the family court has jurisdiction to reconsider a voided\r\n  agreement, at least to the extent of the part declared void.Â  The question\r\n  becomes whether the family court on remand should be confined to a fresh look\r\n  at the matter of equitable division of the marital estate, or whether all\r\n  issues, including alimony, should likewise be considered.Â  Because it is\r\n  readily apparent that the parties' desire to equitably divide Rubin's Social\r\n  Security benefits was a significant feature of the overall agreement, we expand\r\n  the scope of the remand to include Essie's alimony claim.\r\nThe agreement represented a &quot;compromise.&quot;Â \r\n  The parties agreed that Essie would receive $5,000 lump sum alimony, $20,000 in\r\n  immediate property distribution, and ultimately one-third to one-half of\r\n  Rubin's Social Security benefits.Â  In exchange, Essie gave up her rights in the\r\n  marital home, Rubin's pension from the International Longshoreman's\r\n  Association, and an alimony arrearage.Â  As is customary in divorce settlements,\r\n  it would be difficult to fairly view the various aspects of this agreement in\r\n  isolation.Â  In other words, the parties' intended agreement concerning alimony\r\n  is inextricably connected to the agreed upon division of marital property, and \r\n\r\nvice versa.Â  In\r\n  this context, and in view of Rule 60(b)(5), SCRCP, basic principles of equity\r\n  suggest that all issues should be revisited by the family court.Â  \r\nWe recognize the\r\n  practical difficulties confronting the family court on remand in attempting to\r\n  fashion an equitable result more than twenty years after the divorce.Â  But that\r\n  challenge pales in comparison to Rubin's suggestion that we simply end this matter\r\n  with the remnant of the agreement remaining valid.Â  We direct the family court\r\n  to consider the issues raised in Essie's complaint.Â  To the extent the\r\n  agreement has been executed, proper credits must be given to Essie and Rubin,\r\n  respectively.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The\r\n  agreement further provided that &quot;[t]he parties acknowledge that the agreement\r\n  set forth . . . represents a compromise . . . .&quot;Â  Both parties\r\n  stipulated that the agreement was &quot;fair and reasonable, both to himself or\r\n  herself as well as the other party,&quot; that &quot;the subject agreement\r\n  [was] an equitable resolution to all of the issues before them,&quot; and that\r\n  &quot;the agreement [was] fair and equitable under all of the\r\n  circumstances.&quot; \r\n[2] &quot;On motion and upon such terms as are just, the\r\n  court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment,\r\n  order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . . .

Gregory, 364\r\n  S.C. 150, 612 S.E.2d 449 (2005), the solicitor filed a motion entitled &quot;Motion\r\n  to Have the Court Determine Whether Defense Counsel has an Actual Conflict of\r\n  Interest.&quot;Â  The solicitor's concern stemmed from Murphy's representation\r\n  of the solicitor's lead investigator, Tim Stevenson, in his divorce action.Â  Stevenson\r\n  was purported to be a potential witness in the prosecution against Appellant.\r\nThe trial court conducted\r\n  an evidentiary hearing on the matter in February 2006.Â  At the hearing,\r\n  Stevenson testified that he had hired Murphy to represent him in his divorce in\r\n  June 2005, only a few months prior to Murphy's appointment as Appellant's\r\n  lawyer.Â  He testified that he hired her for the entire divorce and that he\r\n  still considered her his lawyer.Â  Further, he testified that she had not\r\n  withdrawn as his lawyer or notified him that she no longer represented him.Â \r\n  Murphy, on the other hand, testified that she had agreed to represent Stevenson\r\n  only to complete his separation agreement, which had been completed.Â  She\r\n  acknowledged that she had not sent a formal notice of withdrawal.Â  There was no\r\n  written agreement between Murphy and Stevenson.Â  Both sides presented expert\r\n  testimony on the conflict of interest issue. \r\nUltimately, the trial\r\n  court removed Murphy from the case, noting that it could &quot;not risk the\r\n  possibility of Mr. Stevenson being called in this case and needing [sic] to be\r\n  cross examined,&quot; and appointed new second-chair counsel.Â  \r\nMore than two and\r\n  one-half years later, on December 11,\r\n  2008, Appellant pled guilty to murder.Â  During the sentencing phase, the trial\r\n  court sentenced Appellant to death for Bregenzer's murder, citing Appellant's\r\n  prior murder convictions as the aggravating circumstance.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(2) (2003) (&quot;The murder was committed by a person with\r\n  a prior conviction for murder.&quot;).Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nA. \r\nAppellant raises one issue on\r\n  appeal: did the trial court abuse its discretion by disqualifying Appellant's originally\r\n  appointed second-chair counsel?Â  We hold that it did not.\r\nAn accused has the right to the\r\n  assistance of counsel.Â  U.S. Const.Â  amend. VI; Gideon v. Wainwright,\r\n  372 U.S. 335 (1963).Â  &quot;[A] motion to relieve counsel is addressed to the\r\n  discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Gregory, 364 S.C. 150, 152, 612 S.E.2d 449,\r\n  450 (2005) (quoting State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 385, 548 S.E.2d\r\n  210, 211 (2001)). \r\nWe acknowledge that it is a\r\n  close question whether Murphy's representation of Stevenson was ongoing or had\r\n  concluded.Â  Moreover, it is fairly debatable whether Stevenson's potential\r\n  testimony presented an actual conflict of interest. Â However, given the\r\n  conflicting evidence before the trial court, and giving deference to its\r\n  findings of fact, we find no abuse of discretion in the disqualification of\r\n  Murphy.\r\nWe recognize the State's\r\n  motion came on the heels of our decision in State v. Gregory.[6] Â Â Gregory presents a far more compelling case for relieving counsel than\r\n  the case before us today.Â  At Gregory's insistence, defense counsel moved to be\r\n  relieved after informing Gregory of counsel's representation of an assistant\r\n  solicitor in a divorce action.Â  Gregory believed his counsel and the solicitor's\r\n  office were &quot;in cahoots.&quot;Â  Finding no prejudice to counsel's\r\n  continued representation of Gregory, the trial court denied the motion to\r\n  relieve counsel.Â  We reversed, finding &quot;Gregory's attorney had an actual\r\n  conflict because he placed himself in a 'situation inherently conducive to\r\n  divided loyalties' by simultaneously representing Gregory and the assistant\r\n  solicitor who was handling his criminal case.&quot;Â  Id. at 154, 612\r\n  S.E.2d at 451.Â  Notwithstanding the distinguishing features in Gregory,\r\n  we cannot say the decision to relieve Murphy amounted to an abuse of\r\n  discretion.[7]\r\nB.\r\nWe note Appellant was ultimately\r\n  represented by attorneys with substantial death penalty experience, Walter\r\n  Bailey and Norbert Cummings.Â  Appellant had long expressed a desire to plead\r\n  guilty and to receive the death penalty.Â  The trial court conducted an\r\n  extensive guilty plea voir dire,[8] including numerous questions which revealed Appellant's complete satisfaction with\r\n  Bailey and Cummings.[9] Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIII.\r\nProportionality Review\r\nWe review the proportionality\r\n  of Appellant's sentence in accordance with South Carolina law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (2003).Â  The aggravating circumstance\r\n  in this case is a prior conviction for murder, for which section\r\n  16-3-20(C)(a)(2) permits the imposition of the death penalty.Â  We find the\r\n  record establishes that the death sentence was not the result of passion,\r\n  prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.&nbsp; Furthermore, a review of other\r\n  decisions in which a defendant was sentenced to death when he had a prior\r\n  conviction for murder demonstrates that Appellant's death sentence is neither\r\n  excessive nor disproportionate. &nbsp;See State v. Motts, Op. No.\r\n  26947 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 21, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 45); State\r\n    v.

Blair, 275 S.C. 529, 273 S.E.2d 536 (1981), hearing to\r\n  determine whether Appellant was competent to plead guilty and to assist his\r\n  attorneys in his defense.Â  The trial court found that Appellant was competent,\r\n  and there is no suggestion to the contrary.\r\n[9] Prior to the guilty plea hearing, Appellant had instructed his attorneys not to\r\n  present any mitigating evidence.Â  Nonetheless, Bailey and Cummings investigated\r\n  possible mitigating circumstances and prepared to introduce evidence in that\r\n  regard. Â They even sought ethical advice on the potential presentation of\r\n  mitigating evidence notwithstanding Appellant's instructions.Â  In the\r\n  sentencing phase, Appellant wrote a note to the trial court, which stated, &quot;[I] ask that you punish me to the\r\n  fullest extent of the law, this being the death sentence.Â  I truly believe this\r\n  punishment is the only just punishment for the crime I've committed.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26972","title":"Mazloom v.

Lewis, 2008-UP-645 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  The issues are: (1) the court of appeals' reversal of the family\r\n  court's determination of the value of the marital home, and (2) the court of\r\n  appeals' reversal and modification of the family court's award of expert\r\n  witness fees to Petitioner.Â  We reverse the court of appeals' decision and\r\n  reinstate the family court's order.[1]\r\nI.\r\nStandard of Review\r\n&quot;In\r\n  appeals from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts\r\n  in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â However, this broad scope of review does not require\r\n  this Court to disregard the findings of the family court.&quot;Â  Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 479, 682 S.E.2d 804, 807 (2009) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  More recently, we held that &quot;[a]n appellate court should approach an equitable division award with a presumption that the family\r\n  court acted within its broad discretion. Â The family court's award should be\r\n  reversed only when the appellant demonstrates an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Dawkins\r\n    v. Dawkins, 386 S.C. 169, 172-73, 687 S.E.2d 52, 54 (2010).\r\nWe take\r\n  this opportunity to give historical context to the appellate court standard of\r\n  review of family court factual findings.\r\nA.\r\nThe myriad of modern cases setting forth an abuse of\r\n  discretion as the standard of review in appeals from the family court may be\r\n  traced to two common features found in our earlier jurisprudence concerning\r\n  appeals in equity cases.Â  The primary one is the familiar mantra that the appellate\r\n  court is not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who was in a\r\n  superior position to make credibility determinations.Â  The second concept is\r\n  the tenet that de novo standard of review does not relieve an appellant\r\n  from demonstrating error in the trial court's findings of fact.Â  See Crowder\r\n    v. Crowder, 246 S.C. 299, 301, 143 S.E.2d 580, 581 (1965) (citing Forester\r\n      v. Forester, 226 S.C. 311, 85 S.E.2d 187 (1954)) (&quot;It is now well\r\n  settled that this court has jurisdiction in appeals in equity cases to find the\r\n  facts in accord with our view of the\r\n  preponderance or greater weight of the evidence, in the absence of a verdict by\r\n  a jury; and may reverse a factual finding by the lower court in such cases when\r\n  the appellant satisfies this court that the finding is against the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.&quot;); Inabinet v. Inabinet, 236 S.C.\r\n  52, 55-56, 113 S.E.2d 66, 67 (1960) (citing Twitty v. Harrison, 230 S.C.\r\n  174, 94 S.E.2d 879 (1956)) (&quot;Our duty in equity cases to review challenged\r\n  findings of fact as well as matters of law does not require that we disregard\r\n  the findings below or that we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, was in better position than\r\n  we are to evaluate their credibility; nor does it relieve appellant of the\r\n  burden of convincing this court that the trial judge erred in his findings of\r\n  fact.&quot;); Gilbert v. McLeod Infirmary, 219 S.C. 174, 184, 64 S.E.2d\r\n  524, 528 (1951) (&quot;We have jurisdiction in appeals in equity to find the facts in accord with our view of the\r\n  preponderance or greater weight of the evidence, in the absence of verdict by\r\n  jury.&quot;); Wise v. Wise, 60 S.C. 426, 449, 38 S.E. 794, 802-03 (1901)\r\n  (McIver, C.J., dissenting and quoting Finley v. Cartwright, 55 S.C. 198,\r\n  33 S.E. 359 (1899)) (&quot;Whatever differences of opinion may once have existed as to the rule which should govern where an\r\n  appellant . . . asks this court to reverse the findings of fact by the circuit\r\n  judge in an equity case, it must now, since the decision in Finley v.\r\n    Cartwright . . . be regarded as settled 'that this court may reverse a\r\n  finding of fact by the circuit court when the appellant satisfies this court\r\n  that the preponderance of the evidence is against the finding of the circuit\r\n  court.'&quot;).\r\nThe family court is a court of equity.Â  Article V, Â§ 5\r\n  of the South Carolina Constitution provides in relevant part that our appellate\r\n  jurisdiction in cases of equity requires that we &quot;review the findings of\r\n  fact as well as the law.&quot;Â  This constitutional provision was adopted as\r\n  article V, Â§ 4 of the Constitution of 1895.[2]Â  Shortly thereafter, we\r\n  interpreted this provision and held that &quot;it may now be regarded as\r\n  settled that this court may reverse a finding of fact by the circuit court [in\r\n  a case of equity] when appellant satisfies this court that the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence is against the finding of the circuit court.&quot;Â  Finley,\r\n  55 S.C. at 202, 33 S.E. at 360-61.Â  This language served as the forerunner to the\r\n  often-quoted language that an appellate court may take its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence, as included in the landmark standard of review\r\n  case, Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville: &quot;In an action\r\n  in equity, tried by the judge alone, without a reference, on appeal the Supreme\r\n  Court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.&quot; Â 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n  (1976) (citing Crowder, 246 S.C. 299, 143 S.E.2d 580).Â  Our standard of\r\n  review, therefore, is de novo.Â  Our modern day usage of the term\r\n  &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; does not comport with our constitutionally\r\n  authorized standard of review.[3]\r\nB.\r\nThe South Carolina family\r\n  court was created in 1977 as part of the adoption of our unified judicial\r\n  system.[4]Â  &quot;All single county and multi-county family courts,\r\n  juvenile courts, domestic relations courts, juvenile and domestic relations\r\n  courts, shall be abolished on July 1, 1977, and the jurisdiction of such courts\r\n  devolved upon the statewide family court system as established by this title.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-2-10 (Supp. 2009); see also S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 1 (&quot;The judicial power shall be vested in a unified judicial system,\r\n  which shall include a Supreme Court, a Court of Appeals, a Circuit Court, and\r\n  such other courts of uniform jurisdiction as may be provided for by general\r\n  law.&quot;).\r\nInitially, the family courts\r\n  operated with little statutory guidance and scarce case law.Â  For example,\r\n  approaches to alimony awards, the division of marital property, and the effect\r\n  of marital misconduct on dissolution issues found incomplete guidance in the\r\n  case law.Â  Family court findings in the early years often reflected the court's\r\n  attempt not only to find facts, but also to discern the law.Â  As a result,\r\n  appellate court decisions became the primary source of domestic relations law.\r\nBecause of\r\n  the frequent interrelationship of fact and law, there were instances where we exercised\r\n  our broad equitable standard of review and made findings of fact.Â  When we\r\n  reversed a family court's finding based on de novo review, we often said\r\n  the family court &quot;abused its discretion.&quot;Â  See Shaluly v. Shaluly, 284 S.C. 71, 74,\r\n  325 S.E.2d 66, 67 (1985) (where the family court failed to make findings, this\r\n  Court made its own findings and observed, &quot;we have studied the record and listened to the arguments of counsel and\r\n  reached the decision that the judge abused his discretion in failing to allocate\r\n  the wife a more abundant portion of the property she helped to accumulate&quot;); Lide v.\r\n    Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 158, 283 S.E.2d\r\n  832, 834 (1981) (weighing the evidence and concluding, &quot;the trial judge\r\n  abused his discretion in denying alimony to the wife&quot;).\r\nNevertheless, this Court and the court of appeals\r\n  generally sustained (and continue to sustain) family court findings of fact,\r\n  notwithstanding our constitutional imprimatur for de novo review.Â  The\r\n  tendency to affirm family court findings of fact may be traced to the two\r\n  features noted aboveâ€”the superior position of the trial judge to determine\r\n  credibility and the appellant's burden to satisfy the appellate court that the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence is against the finding of the trial court.Â  See Wilson v. Wilson, 285 S.C. 481, 483, 330 S.E.2d 303, 304 (1985) (citing McAlister\r\n    v. Patterson, 278 S.C. 481, 299 S.E.2d 322 (1982)) (&quot;Although our\r\n  scope of review allows us to find the facts in accordance with our view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence, we give broad discretion to the family court\r\n  judge who has observed the witnesses and is in a better position to judge their\r\n  demeanor and veracity.&quot;); Perry v. Perry, 301 S.C. 147, 149, 390\r\n  S.E.2d 480, 481 (Ct. App. 1990) (citing Ray v. Ray, 296 S.C. 350, 372\r\n  S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 1988)) (&quot;The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction in a\r\n  divorce case to find facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence; however, it is not required to disregard the findings of the\r\n  trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and \r\nwas in a better position to\r\n  evaluate their testimony.&quot;); Sealy v. Sealy, 295 S.C. 281, 283, 368\r\n  S.E.2d 85, 87 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding the appellate court had &quot;ample\r\n  evidence to support the trial judge's finding&quot;).[5]Â \r\n  Stated differently, de novo review neither relieves an appellant\r\n  of demonstrating error nor requires us to ignore the findings of the family\r\n  court.Â  The presence of de novo review and a willingness, after review,\r\n  to defer to the fact finder should not be viewed as contradictory positions.\r\nC.\r\nThe tendency to sustain family court findings\r\n  continued as the General Assembly began to pass legislation to provide\r\n  guidelines to family court judges in the exercise of their enormous\r\n  responsibility and discretion.[6]Â  With the benefit of\r\n  increasing legislative standards in many areas, family court disputes evolved\r\n  to be more and more fact-driven as appellate courts were called on less to\r\n  declare the law.Â  As the family court system has matured, while retaining our\r\n  constitutional authority to make our own findings of fact, appellate court\r\n  decisions have continued to reflect a preference to sustain a family court's\r\n  factual findings. Â \r\nThe highly fact-intensive nature of family court\r\n  matters lends itself to a respect for the factual findings of our able and\r\n  experienced family court judges who are in a superior position to assess the\r\n  demeanor and credibility of witnesses.Â  Indeed, life-altering credibility\r\n  determinations often lie at the heart of family court factual findings.Â  However,\r\n  neither our respect for the family court bench nor the special need for\r\n  finality in family court litigation may serve as a license to lessen our\r\n  standard of review in family court appeals.\r\n&quot;An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the decision is controlled by some error of law or is based on\r\n  findings of fact that are without evidentiary support.&quot;Â  Eason, 384\r\n  S.C. at 479, 682 S.E.2d at 807.Â  De novo review permits appellate court\r\n  fact-finding, notwithstanding the presence of evidence supporting the trial\r\n  court's findings.Â  We must acknowledge\r\n  that the term &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; is a misnomer in light of the\r\n  authorized de novo review in article V, Â§ 5 of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution.\r\nWe are nevertheless persuaded\r\n  that the inartful use of an abuse of discretion deferential standard of review\r\n  merely represents the appellate courts' effort to incorporate the two sound\r\n  principles underlying the proper review of an equity case.Â  As discussed above,\r\n  those two principles are the superior position of the trial judge to determine\r\n  credibility and the imposition of a burden on an appellant to satisfy the appellate court that the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence is against the finding of the trial court.Â  Those \r\n\r\nprinciples are consistent\r\n  with our historic approach to de novo review.Â  This is the appropriate\r\n  frame of reference for construing the abuse of discretion language in family\r\n  court cases.[7]\r\nD.\r\nThis approach to reviewing\r\n  family court factual findings for an abuse of discretion may be seen in the\r\n  primary issues before us today, equitable division and property valuation.Â \r\n  Typical of our pronouncements is: &quot;Family\r\n  court judges have wide discretion in determining how marital property is to be\r\n  distributed.Â  They may use any reasonable means to divide the property\r\n  equitably, and their judgment will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39,\r\n  41-42 (1995).Â  Although statutory factors provide guidance, there is no formulaic\r\n  approach for determining an equitable apportionment of marital property.Â \r\n  Similarly, as for a family court's finding of a marital asset's value, &quot;[d]etermination\r\n  of fair market value is a question of fact.&quot; Â Payne v. Holiday Towers,\r\n    Inc., 283 S.C. 210, 215, 321 S.E.2d 179, 182 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Consequently,\r\n  we have recognized the presence of discretion in the family court in valuing\r\n  marital property and in effecting a division of marital property that is\r\n  equitable under the circumstances.Â  This acknowledgement of discretion should\r\n  not be construed as an abandonment of our authority to make our own findings of\r\n  fact.\r\nIn sum, while retaining the\r\n  authority to make our own findings of fact,[8] we recognize the superior\r\n  position of the family court judge in making credibility determinations.Â \r\n  Moreover, consistent with our constitutional authority for de novo review, an appellant is not relieved of his burden to demonstrate error in the\r\n  family court's findings of fact.Â  Consequently, the family court's factual\r\n  findings will be affirmed unless &quot;appellant satisfies this court that the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence is against the finding of the [family]\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Finley, 55 S.C. at 202, 33 S.E. at 360-61.\r\nII.\r\nValue of Marital Residence\r\nPetitioner\r\n  retained an expert real estate appraiser to render an opinion on the value of\r\n  the parties' former marital residence, a plantation home in Williamsburg\r\n  County.Â  Without objection, the appraiser assigned a value of $800,000.Â  The\r\n  appraiser provided detailed evidence supporting his methodology and selection of comparable properties.Â  Petitioner\r\n  additionally introduced the appraiser's comprehensive report into evidence\r\n  without objection.Â  Respondent\r\n  offered only cursory valuation evidence and focused almost exclusively on\r\n  disputing the appraiser's value.[9]Â  Petitioner\r\n  contends the family court acted within its discretion when it accepted the\r\n  appraiser's value of $800,000.Â  We agree.\r\nThe court of\r\n  appeals adopted Respondent's challenge to the appraiser's sales comparison\r\n  approach, expressed &quot;sympathy&quot; for Respondent's &quot;concerns,&quot;\r\n  and found &quot;the family court's finding about the worth of the marital home\r\n  is not supported by the record.&quot;[10]Â  We have\r\n  reviewed the record, under our de novo review, and find evidence to\r\n  support the $800,000 value.Â  Beyond a superficial presentation for a\r\n  substantially lower value, Respondent elected to approach the valuation issue\r\n  by challenging the appraiser's valuation.Â  Under the facts presented, we reject\r\n  Respondent's contention that the appraiser's valuation is not entitled to\r\n  weight.Â  Respondent has failed to demonstrate error in the family court's\r\n  valuation.Â  We, therefore, decline to alter the factual finding of the family\r\n  court.[11]\r\n&quot;The family court has\r\n  broad discretion in valuing the marital property. Â A family court may accept\r\n  the valuation of one party over another, and the court's valuation of marital\r\n  property will be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence\r\n  presented.&quot;Â  Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 264, 631 S.E.2d 279, 283\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006) (citation omitted).Â  &quot;We have stated before, and we\r\n  reiterate here, that a party cannot sit back at trial without offering proof, then come to this Court\r\n  complaining of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the family court's\r\n  findings.&quot; Â Honea v. Honea, 292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d 191, 192 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1987) (citing Cox v. Cox, 290 S.C. 246, 349 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 1986));\r\n  see also Hough, 312 S.C. 344, 440 S.E.2d 387; Hudson v.

App. 1987).Â  Because Respondent has failed to\r\n  establish error in the family court's valuation, we reverse the court of\r\n  appeals.\r\nIII.\r\nExpert Witness Fees\r\nThe family court\r\n  ordered Respondent to pay Petitioner $23,066.25 for expert witness fees.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals accepted Respondent's &quot;alternative that these fees be\r\n  prorated in the same percentages as the equitable division award itself.&quot;Â  Lewis, 2008-UP-645 at 7.Â  The family court awarded fifty-five\r\n  percent of the marital property to Respondent and forty-five percent to\r\n  Petitioner.Â  Petitioner contends the family court acted within its discretion\r\n  in ordering Respondent to pay expert witness fees of $23,066.25.\r\n&quot;The decision of whether\r\n  to award expert witness fees, like the decision to award attorney fees, rests\r\n  within the sound discretion of the family court.&quot;Â  Brunner v. Brunner, 296 S.C. 60, 62, 370 S.E.2d 614, 616 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The family court found\r\n  the various experts credible and accepted their valuations.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  court noted that the experts' valuations were material to the relief Petitioner\r\n  sought and obtained.Â  We further note the large disparity in the parties'\r\n  incomesâ€”Respondent makes $24,000 per month, while Petitioner makes $436 per\r\n  month.Â  We concur in the family court's allocation of expert witness fees.Â  The\r\n  contrary decision of the court of appeals is reversed.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur.

S.C. Public Service Commission,\r\n  242 S.C. 528, 131 S.E.2d 705 (1963), the Court explained the attributes of the\r\n  common law writ of certiorari:\r\n\r\n  At common law the writ of certiorari is used for two purposes: (1)\r\n    As an appellate proceeding for the re-examination of some action of an inferior\r\n    tribunal. (2) As an auxiliary process to enable the Court to obtain further\r\n    information with respect to some matter already before it for adjudication. \r\n  While certiorari has been said to be original in nature, it has\r\n    also been said to be appellate. It may be said, indeed, to have characteristics\r\n    of both. For example, to the extent that it involves the review of the\r\n    proceedings of an inferior court, certiorari is an appellate proceeding, but to\r\n    the extent that the subject matter of the proceeding brought before the\r\n    appellate court will not be reinvestigated, tried, or determined on the merits\r\n    as on appeal or writ of error, it is an original proceeding. \r\n\r\n242 S.C. at 534, 131 S.E.2d\r\n  at 708 (citations omitted).Â  When reviewing the\r\n  decision of an inferior tribunal &quot;on certiorari&quot; or &quot;on\r\n  appeal,&quot; the writ is said to be appellate in nature.Â  Id. (&quot;An\r\n  appeal is a review by a superior court of some proceeding held in an inferior\r\n  tribunal. The method of review may be called appeal or certiorari and be\r\n  classified as an appellate proceeding . . . .&quot;); Â Rowe v. City of W.\r\n    Columbia, 334 S.C. 400, 404, 513 S.E.2d 379, 381 (Ct.

McLeod Infirmary, 219 S.C.\r\n  174, 64 S.E.2d 524, 528 (1951)).Â  Based on the foregoing, I am unable to find\r\n  any merit in the dissent's rationale.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  concurs\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  As I find that the Court of\r\n  Appeals committed no error of law, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as\r\n  improvidently granted.\r\nI appreciate the history, set\r\n  out in the majority, of this Court's review of cases originating in the family\r\n  courts in South Carolina.Â  The majority focuses its review on the family court\r\n  and cites the standard for the review of family court findings on appeal.Â \r\n  However, as noted by the majority, this case is before this Court by virtue of\r\n  our issuance of a writ of certiorari to review two issues in the Court\r\n    of Appeals decision: (1) the Court of Appeals reversal of the family\r\n  court's determination of the value of the martial home, and (2) the Court of\r\n  Appeals reversal and modification of the family court's award of expert witness\r\n  fees to Petitioner.Â  As explained below, our review on certiorari is confined\r\n  to an examination of the decision of the Court of Appeals for errors of law or\r\n  for findings which are wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  See Hollman\r\n    v. Woolfson, 384 S.C. 571, 577, 683 S.E.2d 495, 498 (2009); Turner v.\r\n      State, 384 S.C. 451, 453, 682 S.E.2d 792, 793 (2009).\r\nIn my view, this case\r\n  requires us to directly address, for the first time,[14] the consequences of Rule 242, SCACR, which provides that appellate review by\r\n  the Supreme Court of decisions of the Court of Appeals is by certiorari.Â  My\r\n  research convinces me that the first question when determining an appellate\r\n  tribunal's scope of review is a determination of the method of review, i.e. by appeal\r\n  or by certiorari.Â  That certiorari and appeal are different methods is\r\n  recognized by the Constitution[15] as well as by statute.[16]Â \r\n  If the method of review is by certiorari, then case law dictates that review is\r\n  limited to review of errors of law including findings wholly unsupported by the\r\n  evidence.Â  E.g. City of Columbia v. S.C. Pub. Serv. C'n, 242 S.C.\r\n  528, 131 S.E.2d 705 (1963); Carolina, C. &amp; O. Ry of South Carolina v.\r\n    Worley, 102 S.C. 302, 86 S.E. 820 (1915).Â  On the other hand, when the\r\n  Court's review is by appeal, then the scope of review is governed by the nature\r\n  of the action, i.e. whether it is at law or in equity.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§5;\r\n  Â§ 14-3-320; Â§ 14-3-330.Â  \r\nThe General Assembly provided\r\n  that there would be no appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals, and that\r\n  review of those decisions by this Court, if any, would be by discretionary\r\n  review.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-210 (Supp. 2009).Â  As is our prerogative when\r\n  the legislature provides for our discretionary review, we chose to require that\r\n  a party seeking review of the lower tribunal's decision do so through a\r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  See Knight v. State, 284 S.C.\r\n  138, 325 S.E.2d 535 (1985) (under pre-1999 version of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-27-100, Court could constitutionally require post-conviction relief\r\n  appellate review to be by certiorari).Â  I do not seek to alchemize equity into\r\n  law, but rather to logically apply our constitution, our statutory law, and our\r\n  established precedent to the novel question of what our scope of review is on\r\n  certiorari to the Court of Appeals.\r\nThe Court of Appeals decision\r\n  reversing the family court's order with regard to valuation of the marital\r\n  estate should only be overturned if based on an error of law or if wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence.Â  By my reading, the Court of Appeals reversed and\r\n  remanded the case because it found the family court committed an error of law by automatically accepting the expert's opinion.Â  The Court of Appeals held:\r\n  &quot;In this case . . . Husband has expressed valid concerns that the family\r\n  court automatically accepted the opinion of Wife's appraiser merely because the\r\n  appraiser was deemed to be an expert and never considered whether that opinion\r\n  was actually supported by the evidence on which it was purportedly based.Â  Cf. Sauers v. Poulin Bros. Homes, Inc., 328 S.C. 601, 605, 493 S.E.2d 503,\r\n  505 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating the fact that expert testimony was not directly\r\n  refuted does not automatically entitle the party offering such testimony to a\r\n  directed verdict).&quot;Â  With regard to valuation of the marital home, the\r\n  family court held as follows:\r\nIt is\r\n  well settled law that an owner familiar with his or her property may give his\r\n  or her opinion of value of the property.Â  However, where an owner is not an\r\n  expert in the field of real estate appraisals, or one who even\r\n  &quot;dabbles&quot; in the real estate sales area, I find it would be an abuse\r\n  of discretion to reject the expert appraisals while adopting the owner's\r\n  values.Â  I am mindful of Husband's arguments and positions related to the\r\n  values debate, and I do indeed appreciate the position he takes.Â  However, I do\r\n  not find that I can or should ignore the values offered by experts in their\r\n  fields, especially when Husband did not counter those experts' opinions with\r\n  his experts' values.Â  Husband did offer numerous properties in the area to\r\n  bolster his argument that the home and tracts are valued too high but I am not\r\n  a real estate appraiser, and am certainly not versed in the methods of\r\n  comparing different and similar properties.Â  And just as I cannot\r\n  &quot;average&quot; values I cannot lower values without credible reasons to do\r\n  so.Â  As to the experts Wife used at trial, I find them to be experienced,\r\n  educated in their fields, convincing in their methodology, and credible.Â  I\r\n  therefore adopt the values each gave to certain pieces and parcels of personal\r\n  and real property.\r\nIn my view, this excerpt from\r\n  the family court order provides ample support for the ruling of the Court of\r\n  Appeals.Â  Despite finding the family court's order affected by an error of law,\r\n  the Court of Appeals exercised its obligation to conduct a de novo review\r\n  of the record to determine if the family court's ruling nonetheless reached a\r\n  valuation otherwise supported by the evidence.Â  Finding flaws in the evidence\r\n  presented by Wife's expert, the Court of Appeals declined to assign its own\r\n  value to the property and instead chose to remand the matter to the family court\r\n  which, it noted, may accept additional evidence.Â  I can find no error of law in\r\n  the Court of Appeals assessment of the evidence or in its decision to defer to\r\n  the family court by remanding the case for further proceedings.\r\nIn reversing the Court of Appeals,\r\n  the majority finds evidence to support the family court's valuation and\r\n  therefore &quot;decline[s] to alter the factual finding of the family\r\n  court.&quot;Â  As explained above, in my view, the majority's analysis fails to\r\n  address the issue before this Court, namely whether the Court of Appeals erred\r\n  in reversing the family court.\r\n  \r\n\r\nFinally, I note that, in\r\n  support of its decision, the majority also cites cases for the proposition that\r\n  &quot;a party cannot sit back at trial without offering proof, then come to\r\n  this Court complaining of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the\r\n  family court's findings.&quot;Â  In my opinion, such cases are inapplicable to\r\n  the instant case.Â  As the family court discussed in the portion of the order\r\n  cited above, Respondent disputed the valuation by Wife's expert, offered\r\n  comparable properties, and stated his own opinion as to what the home was\r\n  worth.Â  See Seaboard Coast Line R.R. v. Harrelson, 262 S.C. 43,\r\n  46, 202 S.E.2d 4, 5 (1974) (landowner may testify as to the value of his land). \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn my view, the Court of\r\n  Appeals committed no error of law in reversing and remanding the family court's\r\n  order.Â  I would therefore dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently\r\n  granted.\r\n\r\n[1] The balance of the court\r\n  of appeals' decision stands.\r\n[2] A similar constitutional\r\n  provision was adopted as article IV, Â§ 4 of the South Carolina Constitution of\r\n  1868.\r\n[3] As noted, article V, Â§ 5 of\r\n  the South Carolina Constitution sets forth appellate court jurisdiction in\r\n  equity cases.Â  The Legislature, shortly after adoption of the 1895\r\n  Constitution, codified this principle as Act No. 3, Â§ 15 of the 1896 South\r\n  Carolina Statutes at Large; this was the precursor to South Carolina Code\r\n  section 14-3-320.Â  In 1983, the Legislature enacted Act No. 89, 1983 S.C. Acts\r\n  160, which amended this statute to restrict the review of the findings of fact\r\n  of the family court &quot;to a determination of whether or not there is\r\n  substantial evidence to sustain such facts.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 (1976\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  This language was declared unconstitutional in Rutherford\r\n    v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992).Â  In answering the\r\n  question of &quot;what is the proper standard of appellate review in domestic\r\n  actions from the family courts,&quot; Rutherford held that &quot;[i]n\r\n  appeals from all equity actions including those from the Family Court, the\r\n  appellate court has authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of\r\n  the preponderance of evidence.&quot;Â  Id. at 201, 204, 414 S.E.2d at\r\n  158, 160.\r\n[4] The statewide system of\r\n  family courts was established through enactment of Act No. 690, 1976 S.C. Acts\r\n  1859.Â  Prior to 1977, some counties had county family court judges, yet much of\r\n  the domestic relations docket was handled by the circuit court judges.Â  The\r\n  circuit court judges generally handled their domestic relations cases on\r\n  Saturday mornings in an assembly line fashion, trying to do what was equitable\r\n  without the benefit of uniform and developed legal criteria.Â  Modern day\r\n  complexities of domestic relations law were unheard of then.\r\n[5] Adhering to the factual findings of the family court\r\n  because of its superior position to judge the witnesses' demeanor and veracity\r\n  is not unique to the family court.Â  We have often cited to that principle in a\r\n  host of equitable matters where we have the authority to take our own view of\r\n  the evidence. Â See, e.g., Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387-88, 544\r\n  S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001) (regarding a quiet title action: &quot;In an appeal from an action in equity, this Court has\r\n  jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence. Â However, this broad scope of review does not require\r\n  an appellate court to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact that the\r\n  trial judge is in the better position to assess the credibility of the\r\n  witnesses.Â  Moreover, the appellant is not relieved of his burden of convincing\r\n  the appellate court the trial judge committed error in his findings.&quot;\r\n  (citations omitted)); U.S. Bank Trust Nat'l Ass'n v.

Acts 2208).\r\n[7] We reiterate that\r\n  appellate deference to factual findings in an equitable action is not\r\n  mandatory.Â  We do not, however, perceive any conflict between our authority to\r\n  make findings of fact and our tendency to sustain family court factual findings\r\n  when the appellant fails to satisfy the appellate court that the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence is against the finding of the family court.Â  This juxtaposition\r\n  of the constitutionally authorized de novo review and our tendency,\r\n  after review, to uphold family court findings is seen in the expression that\r\n  the appellate court is not required to disregard the findings of the trial\r\n  judge who was in a superior position to make credibility determinations.\r\n[8] McCrosson v. Tanenbaum is an example of the appellate court exercising its authority to make its own\r\n  findings of fact and reversing the family court.Â  375 S.C. 225, 652 S.E.2d 73\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007), aff'd in part and vacated in part, 383 S.C. 150, 679\r\n  S.E.2d 172 (2009).Â  This Court affirmed the court of appeals' reversal of the\r\n  family court, but noted that &quot;although the standard of review in such\r\n  cases is broad, an appellate court should be reluctant to substitute its own\r\n  judgment for that of the family court.&quot;Â  McCrosson, 383 S.C. at\r\n  151, 679 S.E.2d at 172, n. 1.\r\n[9] Respondent's brief\r\n  conceded the appraiser's qualification: &quot;Husband does not contend that Mr.\r\n  Hartnett is not an expert.Â  Clearly, Mr. Hartnett has excellent credentials and\r\n  has been qualified as an expert on many occasions.&quot;Â  On his financial declaration, Respondent listed the value of\r\n  the marital residence at $400,000, but he testified at trial to a value\r\n  of $350,000.\r\n[10] We respectfully disagree\r\n  with the dissent's characterization that the court of appeals reversed\r\n  &quot;because it found the family court committed an error of law.&quot;Â  The\r\n  court of appeals treated the issue as one of fact.\r\n[11] There is another\r\n  consideration at play here.Â  The court of appeals understood that Respondent's\r\n  cursory evidence precluded it from definitively finding a value for the home\r\n  that was below the appraiser's recommendation.Â  The court of appeals admitted\r\n  it was &quot;sympathetic to Husband's concerns.&quot;Â  The court of appeals'\r\n  remand instructions invited the family court to &quot;accept additional\r\n  evidence . . . or order supplemental information on its own motion.&quot;Â \r\n  Given Respondent's incomplete presentation at trial, it would be fundamentally\r\n  unfair to Petitioner to give Respondent a second bite at the apple.\r\n[12] The dissent provides\r\n  support for this position by citing two non-equitable cases:Â  Hollman v.\r\n    Wolfson, 384 S.C. 571, 577, 683 S.E.2d 495, 498 (2009) (where the Court\r\n  issued a writ of certiorari to the trial court to review a discovery order\r\n  based on exceptional circumstances and stated &quot;[o]n certiorari, this Court\r\n  will review only errors of law and will not review factual findings unless\r\n  wholly unsupported by the evidence&quot;) and Turner v. State, 384 S.C\r\n  451, 453, 682 S.E.2d 792, 793 (2009)Â  (where the Court granted a writ of\r\n  certiorari to the PCR court to review that courtâ€™s denial of relief to\r\n  petitioner and stated &quot;on certiorari, the PCR courtâ€™s ruling should be\r\n  upheld if it is supported by any evidence of probative value in the record,&quot;\r\n  and the Court will reverse when &quot;[the PCR court] is controlled by an error\r\n  of law&quot; (internal citations omitted)).Â  In my view, despite the Court's\r\n  inclusion of the phrase &quot;on certiorari,&quot; these opinions do\r\n  nothing to advance the dissent's position that because this Court issues\r\n  a writ of certiorari in an equity case, it follows that the Court must limit its scope of review to the correction of errors of law and the correction\r\n  of factual errors only if the facts are unsupported by the evidence.Â  \r\n[13] I also note the dissent's reasoning would lead to the absurd result wherein the\r\n  court of appeals had the capability to exercise greater discretion than this\r\n  Court simply because the case reached that court &quot;on appeal&quot; rather\r\n  than &quot;on certiorari.&quot;\r\n[14] The Chief Justice\r\n  maintains that this question is well-settled.Â  Although I agree that myriad\r\n  decisions on certiorari cite the appeal standard, I am unaware of any case\r\n  which explicitly addresses the issue I raise today.Â  Cf.

Dudek and Senior Appellate Defender Joseph L.\r\n          Savitz, III, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  The State\r\n  appeals the circuit court's grant of respondent's pre-trial motion to dismiss\r\n  on the ground that respondent was entitled to immunity under the Protection of Persons\r\n  and Property Act[1] (the Act). Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was indicted for\r\n  murder after he shot and killed Christopher Spicer (the victim) at respondent's\r\n  home.Â  Prior to trial, respondent moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing he\r\n  was entitled to immunity under the Act. Â At a hearing on respondent's motion, the\r\n  State introduced numerous pieces of evidence, including witness statements and\r\n  testimony, photographs and video of the crime scene, 911 tapes, and the\r\n  victim's autopsy report.Â  \r\nAccording to the statement\r\n  and testimony of respondent's girlfriend, Jean Templeton, she, the victim, and\r\n  the victim's girlfriend, Amanda Grubbs, were guests in respondent's house on\r\n  the night of the shooting.Â  At some point, Grubbs handed the victim a picture\r\n  of respondent's daughter in a cheerleading outfit and the victim began making\r\n  inappropriate comments about the picture.Â  Respondent asked the victim and\r\n  Grubbs to leave.Â  \r\nAccording to Templeton, the\r\n  victim left but returned a few minutes later.Â  The victim was opening the\r\n  screened porch door when respondent exited the front door of the house onto the\r\n  porch with the gun.Â  At one point, the victim began advancing across the porch\r\n  and Templeton was &quot;between [the victim] and [respondent]&quot; and was\r\n  &quot;trying to get [the victim] off the steps and leave.&quot;Â  The victim\r\n  continued to force his way onto the porch. Â Â Templeton claimed respondent\r\n  pointed the gun at the victim and fired.Â  The victim died as a result of the\r\n  gunshot wound to the face.\r\nAfter considering the\r\n  evidence, the circuit court dismissed the indictment finding respondent was\r\n  immune, under the Act, from prosecution.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I. Did the circuit court err in making\r\n    a pre-trial determination of immunity?\r\n  II. Did the circuit court err in\r\n    finding respondent was entitled to immunity under the Act?\r\n  ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Pre-trial\r\n  determination of immunity\r\nThe State argues the circuit court erred in making a\r\n  pre-trial determination of immunity.[2]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe Act provides, &quot;It is\r\n  the intent of the General Assembly to codify the common law Castle Doctrine\r\n  which recognizes that a person's home is his castle . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-11-420(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  The Act also states, &quot;the General\r\n  Assembly finds that it is proper for law-abiding citizens to protect\r\n  themselves, their families, and others from intruders and attackers without\r\n  fear of prosecution or civil action for acting in defense of themselves and\r\n  others.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-420(B) (Supp. 2010). \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Act further provides:\r\n\r\n  (A A person is presumed to have a\r\n    reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily injury to himself or\r\n    another person when using deadly force that is intended or likely to cause\r\n    death or great bodily injury to another person if the person:\r\n  (1)&nbsp; against whom the deadly force is used is in the\r\n    process of unlawfully and forcefully entering, or has unlawfully and forcibly\r\n    entered a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle . . . ; and\r\n  (2)&nbsp; who uses deadly force knows or has reason to believe\r\n    that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and forcible act is occurring\r\n    or has occurred.\r\n  . . . . \r\n  (D) Â  A person who unlawfully and by force enters or\r\n    attempts to enter a person's dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle is\r\n    presumed to be doing so with the intent to commit an unlawful act involving\r\n    force or a violent crime as defined in Section 16-1-60.\r\n  S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-440 (Supp. 2010).\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  immunity provision at issue provides:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who uses deadly force as\r\n    permitted by the provisions of this article or another applicable provision of\r\n    law is justified in using deadly force and is immune from criminal\r\n      prosecution and civil action for the use of deadly force, unless the person\r\n    against whom deadly force was used is a law enforcement officer . . . . \r\n\r\nS. C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-450 (Supp. 2010) (emphasis supplied).\r\nThe primary rule of statutory\r\n  construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. Â Mid-State\r\n    Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690,\r\n  692 (1996). Â Unless there is something in the statute requiring a different\r\n  interpretation, the words used in a statute must be given their ordinary\r\n  meaning.Â  Id.Â  When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous on their\r\n  face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the\r\n  statute according to its literal meaning. Â Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C.\r\n  495, 498, 640 S.E.2d 457, 459 (2007).\r\nBlack's Law Dictionary defines\r\n  &quot;immune&quot; as &quot;having immunity&quot; or being &quot;exempt from a\r\n  duty or liability.&quot;Â  Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009).Â \r\n  &quot;Prosecution&quot; is defined as &quot;a criminal proceeding in which an\r\n  accused person is tried.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe trial court found the\r\n  plain meaning of the immunity provision was to shield a person from a\r\n  &quot;full blown criminal trial.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the trial court found the\r\n  only way this statutorily granted right could be meaningfully enforced was for\r\n  the defendant to be able to raise immunity in a pre-trial motion.\r\nWhether immunity under the\r\n  Act should be determined prior to trial is an issue of first impression in this\r\n  state.Â  Further, the Act does not explicitly provide a procedure for\r\n  determining immunity.Â  In deciding this matter, we find guidance from several\r\n  other states that have addressed similar statutory immunity provisions.Â  \r\nIn Fair v. State, the\r\n  Supreme Court of Georgia held the trial court erred in refusing to rule on the\r\n  defendants' immunity[3] prior to trial.Â  Fair v. State, 284 Ga. 165, 166, 664 S.E.2d 227, 230\r\n  (Ga. 2008).Â  Particularly, the Fair court found that by the plain\r\n  meaning of &quot;immune from prosecution,&quot; the statute must be construed\r\n  to bar criminal proceedings against persons who used force under the\r\n  circumstances set forth in the statute, and that this determination must be made\r\n  before the trial commences.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the recent decision of Dennis\r\n  v. State, 51 So.3d 456 (Fla. 2010), the Supreme Court of Florida approved\r\n  the reasoning of Peterson v. Florida, 983 So.2d 27 (Fla.1st D.C.A. 2008), where the First District Court of Appeal found that by enacting a\r\n  statute[4] similar to the Act at issue here, the legislature intended to establish a true\r\n  immunity and not merely an affirmative defense. Â The Dennis court\r\n  therefore found the plain language of the statute grants defendants a\r\n  substantive right to assert immunity from prosecution and to avoid being subjected\r\n  to a trial.Â  Dennis, 51 So.3d at 462.Â  The Dennis court concluded\r\n  that, where a defendant files a motion to dismiss on the basis of Florida's &quot;Stand\r\n  Your Ground&quot; statute, the trial court should conduct a pre-trial\r\n  evidentiary hearing to decide the factual question of the applicability of the\r\n  statutory immunity.Â  Id.\r\nLikewise, we find that, by\r\n  using the words &quot;immune from criminal prosecution,&quot; the legislature\r\n  intended to create a true immunity, and not simply an affirmative defense.Â  We\r\n  also look to the language of the statute that provides, &quot;the General\r\n  Assembly finds that it is proper for law-abiding citizens to protect\r\n  themselves, their families, and others from intruders and attackers without\r\n    fear of prosecution or civil action for acting in defense of themselves and\r\n  others.&quot;Â  We agree with the circuit court that the legislature intended\r\n  defendants be shielded from trial if they use deadly force as outlined under\r\n  the Act.Â  Immunity under the Act is therefore a bar to prosecution and, upon\r\n  motion of either party, must be decided prior to trial.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the trial court properly made a pre-trial determination of respondent's\r\n  immunity.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent's\r\n  immunity under the Act\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the circuit court erred in finding respondent was entitled to\r\n  immunity under the Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found that, applying any standard of proof, respondent would be\r\n  entitled to immunity under the Act.\r\nThe proper standard of proof\r\n  in determining immunity under the Act is also a novel issue in this state.Â \r\n  Other states have addressed this matter.Â  In Dennis, the Florida Supreme\r\n  Court rejected the State's argument that the pre-trial hearing on immunity\r\n  should test merely whether the State has probable cause to believe the\r\n  defendant's use of force was not legally justified.Â  Dennis, 51 So.3d at\r\n  463.Â  Specifically, the Dennis court found the grant of immunity from\r\n  &quot;criminal prosecution&quot; under the statute &quot;must be interpreted in\r\n  a manner that provides the defendant with more protection from prosecution for\r\n  a justified use of force than the probable cause determination previously\r\n  provided to the defendant by rule.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the court\r\n  found the procedure set out in Peterson, supra, best effectuated\r\n  the intent of the legislature.Â  The Peterson court held that when a\r\n  defendant raises the question of statutory immunity pre-trial, the trial court\r\n  must determine whether the defendant has shown by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that the immunity attaches.Â  Peterson, 983 So.2d at 29.\r\nLikewise, we hold that when a\r\n  party raises the question of statutory immunity prior to trial, the proper standard\r\n  for the circuit court to use in determining immunity under the Act is a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\nTurning to the facts of this\r\n  case, we find there is evidence to support the circuit court's finding that\r\n  respondent was entitled to immunity.Â  Templeton's testimony and statements\r\n  showed that, at the time the victim was shot, she was between the victim and\r\n  respondent, trying to remove the victim from the dwelling.Â  The victim,\r\n  however, continued to force his way onto the porch.Â  We find respondent showed\r\n  by a preponderance of the evidence that the victim was in the process of\r\n  unlawfully and forcefully entering respondent's home in accordance with Â§\r\n  16-11-440.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court properly found respondent was\r\n  entitled to immunity under the Act.\r\nWe further find the circuit\r\n  court's order of dismissal was proper because it found respondent was entitled\r\n  to immunity under the Act under any standard of proof.Â  In other words, had the\r\n  circuit court held respondent to a stricter standard of proof, such as clear\r\n  and convincing evidence or even proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the circuit\r\n  court would have nonetheless found respondent was entitled to immunity.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude a\r\n  pre-trial determination of immunity under the Act using a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence standard is proper and that respondent was entitled to immunity under\r\n  the Act.Â  Accordingly, the findings of the circuit court are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

Williams, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  After his conviction for homicide by child abuse[1] was affirmed on direct appeal, Lucas Bailey filed an application for\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  We granted a petition for a writ of certiorari\r\n  to review the denial of PCR.Â  Bailey contends the judge erred in denying PCR as\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to supplemental jury\r\n  instructions that allowed the jury to convict him for an act that was not\r\n  alleged in the indictment.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Factual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nThis case arises from the tragic death of\r\n  sixteen-month-old Charles Devon Allen (&quot;Victim&quot;).Â  At the time of his\r\n  death, Victim lived with his mother, Amy Hughes, her boyfriend, Bailey, and Victim's\r\n  two sisters, who were then five and six years old, respectively.[2]\r\nAround 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 26, 2001, Bailey\r\n  called 9-1-1 and reported that Victim was not breathing.Â  When Aiken County emergency\r\n  personnel arrived, they found Victim lying face down on the bed.Â  The coroner\r\n  pronounced Victim dead as his body was &quot;cool to the touch&quot; and rigor\r\n    mortis had begun to set in.Â  Based on the history presented by Bailey and\r\n  Hughes, investigators initially believed that Victim might have died from an\r\n  accidental overdose of cold medications.Â  However, upon examining Victim's\r\n  body, the coroner noticed three &quot;circular marks&quot; or &quot;discolorations&quot;\r\n  on the child's abdomen. \r\nThe next day, Dr. Joel Sexton, a forensic pathologist,\r\n  performed an autopsy.Â  Dr. Sexton noted visible bruises on Victim's abdomen.Â \r\n  Upon further examination, he discovered &quot;extensive internal injuries in\r\n  the abdominal region and in the head region.&quot;Â  Injuries to the intestines\r\n  and the mesentery arteries and veins indicated multiple blows had torn the\r\n  areas by compression against the spine.Â  As to Victim's head, Dr. Sexton noted\r\n  that &quot;there were numerous small round contusions . . . in the front, on\r\n  the top of the head, on the right side of the head and in the back,&quot; which\r\n  resulted in swelling of the brain.Â  According to Dr. Sexton, the contusions\r\n  were consistent with a fist or a knuckle-sized object hitting the head.Â  He\r\n  believed the head injuries contributed to Victim's death and were consistent\r\n  with some of the symptoms exhibited by Victim prior to his death.Â  He explained\r\n  that a head injury leads to swelling of the brain, which in turn causes\r\n  vomiting, lethargy, a &quot;limp&quot; body, and eyes that &quot;roll\r\n  back&quot; into the head.Â  \r\nUltimately, Dr. Sexton opined the abdominal injuries\r\n  were the primary cause of Victim's death.Â  He believed that at least one of the\r\n  abdominal injuries had occurred hours before death.Â  He concluded that the\r\n  later abdominal injuries could have caused Victim's death within minutes due to\r\n  the loss of blood.Â  The cause of death was &quot;listed as blood loss which we\r\n  refer to as exsanguination due to laceration of these mesentery arteries and\r\n  veins . . . due to blunt force injury to the abdomen due to a beating.&quot;Â Â Â \r\n  Although Dr. Sexton could not definitively pinpoint Victim's time of death, he\r\n  opined that it occurred sometime after 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, April 26, 2001.Â \r\n  Dr. Sexton believed Victim's injuries were inflicted by an adult as a child\r\n  would not have had the &quot;force&quot; to cause these injuries.Â  Finally, he\r\n  did not believe the cold medications given to Victim prior to his death caused\r\n  or contributed to the death.Â  \r\nLaw enforcement interviewed Hughes and Bailey.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  an Aiken County grand jury indicted Bailey for homicide by child abuse.Â  \r\nAt trial, Hughes testified for the State.Â  Hughes\r\n  testified that she had worked on the Monday and Tuesday preceding Victim's\r\n  death.Â  According to Hughes, Victim was cared for by Bailey on Monday and then\r\n  went to daycare on Tuesday.Â  Because Victim had a cold on Wednesday, Hughes\r\n  stayed home from her job to care for him.Â  Hughes recalled that she and Victim\r\n  went to sleep in the same bed around 8:00 p.m.Â  Around 12:00 or 12:30 a.m.,\r\n  Bailey took Victim into the kitchen to feed him.Â  Hughes, who had remained in\r\n  bed, heard a &quot;loud noise&quot; coming from the kitchen followed by Victim\r\n  crying out.Â  Although Hughes did not get up to check on Victim, she asked\r\n  Bailey what had happened, to which Bailey responded, &quot;Nothing.&quot;Â  When\r\n  Bailey returned to bed around 12:50 a.m., he told Hughes that he had put Victim\r\n  in the bed with his sisters. \r\nHughes stated that her oldest daughter came in the\r\n  next morning and reported that Victim had thrown up.Â  According to Hughes,\r\n  Bailey got up and when he returned he told Hughes that Victim was fine and that\r\n  he had cleaned him up and placed him in his crib.Â  When Hughes checked on\r\n  Victim later on Thursday morning, she observed that Victim was unusually quiet\r\n  and did not stand up in his crib. Â After taking her daughter to school, Hughes\r\n  returned and gave Victim some medicine for his cold, but Victim was unable to\r\n  keep it down.Â  Hughes stayed home from work to care for Victim and called a\r\n  friend to bring additional cold medication.Â  Hughes stated that Victim was\r\n  unable to keep this medication down and that he was weak and &quot;wasn't\r\n  moving.&quot;Â  She then took Victim into the bedroom where she laid down with\r\n  him and Bailey.Â  When Hughes's mother arrived around noon, Hughes left Victim\r\n  with Bailey. Â While she was talking with her mother, Hughes heard a &quot;loud\r\n  sound&quot; from her bedroom.Â  Hughes then asked her daughter to get Victim,\r\n  but her daughter reported that Bailey told her &quot;no.&quot; \r\nApproximately twenty or thirty minutes later, Hughes's\r\n  daughter took Victim out of the bedroom and brought him to Hughes.Â  Hughes\r\n  described Victim as &quot;droopy,&quot; unable to sit up on his own, and that\r\n  his eyes rolled back into his head. Â Around 2:00 p.m., Hughes's friend returned\r\n  with a different cold medication that Victim was able to tolerate.Â  Hughes\r\n  testified that Victim fell asleep and Bailey then put him to bed.Â  After she\r\n  laid down with Victim for approximately thirty minutes to an hour, she got up and\r\n  checked that Victim was breathing normally. \r\nAround 5:00 p.m., Hughes left the home to drive\r\n  Bailey's mother to the store.Â  When Hughes returned home around 6:00 or 6:30\r\n  p.m., she found emergency personnel at her home.Â  At that time, she was\r\n  informed that Victim was dead.Â  Hughes ultimately claimed that Bailey had\r\n  struck Victim, resulting in his death.Â  \r\nDuring his testimony, Bailey adamantly denied hitting\r\n  Victim or causing his death.Â  Although Bailey recounted essentially the same\r\n  timeline as Hughes, he claimed that he and Hughes discussed taking Victim for\r\n  medical treatment but decided to see if Victim felt better after taking\r\n  medication on Thursday.Â  He further testified that he checked on Victim after\r\n  Hughes left on Thursday afternoon and discovered that Victim was not breathing.\r\nIn his jury charge, the judge instructed the jurors on\r\n  the offense of homicide by child abuse by reading the applicable statutory\r\n  language.[3]\r\nApproximately one hour into deliberations, the jury\r\n  sent a note to the judge with several questions concerning evidentiary issues.Â \r\n  Additionally, the jury asked &quot;the difference between the indictment and\r\n  the last statement on the indictment form&quot;[4] and &quot;whether the neglect has to directly contribute to the death.&quot;Â  In\r\n  response to the notes, counsel believed that recharging the statute on the\r\n  offense of homicide by child abuse would be appropriate.\r\nWhen the jury returned to the courtroom, the foreman referenced\r\n  the last sentence of the indictment and explained that the jury &quot;wanted to\r\n  get an understanding of the meaning of the indictment.&quot;Â  After the judge\r\n  read the last sentence of the indictment, the foreman responded:\r\n\r\n  Well, the definition was the question we [were] asking\r\n    for.Â  Also, our verdict to . . . to say this person did that last statement . .\r\n    . you're talking two different . . . \r\n\r\nBefore the foreman finished\r\n  his statement, the judge explained the purpose of the indictment was to\r\n  &quot;state the charges with enough specificity so that the defendant knows\r\n  what he has to defend against.&quot; Â The judge then re-read the applicable\r\n  provisions of the homicide by child abuse statute and gave the jury a printed copy\r\n  of the statute. \r\nApproximately thirty minutes\r\n  later, the jury sent out another note, stating:Â  \r\nDoes the\r\n  State have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt:Â  that the defendant caused\r\n    the death of the child and does the neglect or abuse have to have caused\r\n  the death? \r\nCounsel and the judge debated the meaning of\r\n  the jury's question.Â  When the\r\n  jury returned to the courtroom, the judge explained that &quot;in this case,\r\n  the only allegations are that [the defendant] caused the death of the child by\r\n  neglect and abuse,&quot; and that under the statute several acts qualified as\r\n  &quot;neglect and abuse,&quot; but the State was required to prove only one of them.\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    response, the foreman stated:\r\n  We see .\r\n    . . as a jury, total jury, we see the neglect in the parents, but we fail to\r\n    see evidence that Lorenzo struck the child.Â  There was no evidence to us that\r\n    Lorenzo struck this child.Â  There was neglect, yes, on both parties, but we\r\n    fail to see that - - - and that's written in that document that we didn't see\r\n    any evidence.Â  We didn't see any evidence . . . And the definition of your\r\n    homicide has a combination of both.Â  I know [its] a part of that definition,\r\n    but we fail to see any evidence that he did that. \r\n\r\nThe judge then instructed the\r\n  jury to refer to the language of the homicide by child abuse statute. \r\nOut of the presence of the\r\n  jury, defense counsel indicated her concern over the &quot;emphasis on the neglect\r\n  to the possible exclusion of the rest of the statute;&quot; however, she\r\n  believed the jury understood the judge's explanation.Â  \r\nWhen the jury returned to the\r\n  courtroom, the judge issued supplemental instructions that stated in part:\r\n\r\n  [I]f you\r\n    are distinguishing some acts that you would call abuse and some that you would\r\n    call neglect, that's up to you as long as you kind of go by the statute here.Â \r\n    The statute doesn't really . . . It says it can be abuse or neglect, and it\r\n    doesn't say which acts might be which, but it says that abuse or neglect is an\r\n    act or omission which causes harm.\r\n\r\nSo if there is an act or omission which causes harm\r\n  then that is abuse or neglect, by definition under this statute.Â  Any act which\r\n  causes, any act or omission, or failure to act, which causes harm to the\r\n  child's health, that would be by this statute abuse or neglect, without getting\r\n  into the difference of which is which, it doesn't matter.\r\nThe\r\n  judge further explained that:\r\n\r\n  So you\r\n    have to find that [the defendant] either did something or failed to do\r\n    something . . . that caused the death of the child.Â  Either his doing something\r\n    which is an act, or failing to do something which is an omission.Â  And that that\r\n    conduct on his part, either the act or the omission, caused the death of this\r\n    child.Â  \r\n\r\nMoments later, a juror\r\n  approached the bench and, in an off-the-record discussion, expressed her\r\n  concern to the judge over the definition of the word &quot;caused.&quot;[5]Â \r\n  The judge then gave an instruction on proximate cause.Â  In part, the judge\r\n  stated:Â  &quot;You must find that the State has convinced you beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt that either an act or failure to act on the part of this\r\n  defendant is a proximate cause of the death of this child.&quot; \r\nNine minutes later, the jury\r\n  returned with a guilty verdict.Â  The judge denied counsel's motion for a new\r\n  trial and sentenced Bailey to twenty-five years' imprisonment.Â  \r\nBailey appealed his conviction and sentence to the\r\n  Court of Appeals, alleging the trial judge erred in declining to direct a\r\n  verdict of acquittal.Â  The court affirmed Bailey's conviction and sentence,\r\n  concluding that &quot;substantial circumstantial evidence&quot; supported a\r\n  finding that Bailey abused Victim. Â State v. Bailey, Op. No. 2003-UP-744\r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 17, 2003). Â \r\nSubsequently, Bailey filed a timely PCR application.Â  After\r\n  a hearing, the PCR judge denied Bailey's application.Â  As to trial counsel's\r\n  performance, the PCR judge found, in part, that counsel was not ineffective for\r\n  failing to object to certain jury instructions.Â  In so ruling, the PCR judge concluded\r\n  that counsel's decision constituted trial strategy and that even if counsel's\r\n  performance was deficient, Bailey had not proven prejudice.\r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nBailey contends the judge\r\n  erred in denying his PCR application as his trial counsel was ineffective in\r\n  failing to object to the trial judge's supplemental jury instructions.Â  In\r\n  support of this contention, Bailey claims the instructions allowed the jury to\r\n  convict him for &quot;an act alternative to the one specified with\r\n  particularity in the indictment.&quot;Â  Because &quot;the infliction of\r\n  physical injuries was the specific act alleged in the indictment,&quot; Bailey\r\n  asserts the jury was limited to a determination of whether he committed this\r\n  act.Â  Based on the foreman's statement that the jury found no evidence that\r\n  Bailey struck the child, Bailey claims the jury found &quot;a material variance\r\n  between the act alleged in the indictment and the State's proof.&quot;Â Â Â  Specifically,\r\n  Bailey avers the jury convicted him of an unindicted crime as the jury found\r\n  evidence of neglect rather than the specifically-alleged acts of abuse. Â Given that\r\n  the judge's erroneous instructions precipitated this result, Bailey asserts his\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to these supplemental instructions. \r\nB. \r\nThe Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to\r\n  effective assistance of counsel.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI; Strickland v.\r\n    Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Lomax v. State, 379 S.C. 93, 665\r\n  S.E.2d 164 (2008).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has\r\n  established a two-pronged test to establish ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n  by which a PCR applicant must show (1) counsel's performance\r\n    was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.Â  Strickland,\r\n    466 U.S. at 687; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â \r\n    Under the second prong, the PCR applicant &quot;must show that there is a\r\n    reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\r\n    result of the proceeding would have been different.&quot;Â  Strickland,\r\n    466 U.S. at 694. Â &quot;A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\r\n    undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.&quot; Â Â Simmons v. State,\r\n    331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998).\r\nThis Court will\r\n  uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative\r\n  value to support them, and will reverse the decision of the PCR judge when it\r\n  is controlled by an error of law.Â  Suber v.\r\n    State, 371 S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nC. \r\nAs a threshold matter, the\r\n  State claims Bailey's issue is not preserved for appellate review given it was\r\n  not raised to and ruled upon by the PCR judge.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn his PCR application, Bailey characterized the trial\r\n  judge's instructions as erroneous and confusing because the jury was misled regarding\r\n  the homicide by child abuse statute and the indictment.Â  Additionally, Bailey\r\n  argued that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to certain\r\n  instructions.Â  \r\nDuring the PCR hearing, Bailey testified that his\r\n  trial counsel failed to object to the improper jury instructions.Â  In\r\n  explaining this claim, Bailey referenced the trial judge's supplemental\r\n  instructions and the judge's discussions with the jury regarding its\r\n  questions.Â  Trial counsel admitted that she did not object to these\r\n  instructions and contended her decision constituted trial strategy.Â  Finally,\r\n  in his written order, the PCR judge addressed Bailey's allegation of\r\n  &quot;ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to jury\r\n  charges.&quot; \r\nBased on the foregoing, we find Bailey's argument was\r\n  properly preserved for this Court's review.Â  See State v. Moore,\r\n  357 S.C. 458, 593 S.E.2d 608 (2004) (holding an issue\r\n  must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review).\r\nD.\r\nHaving found that Bailey's issue is properly before\r\n  this Court, we turn to the merits.\r\n&quot;In South Carolina, '[i]t is a rule of universal\r\n  observance in administering the criminal law that a defendant must be\r\n  convicted, if convicted at all, of the particular offense charged in the bill\r\n  of indictment.'&quot;Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 136, 437 S.E.2d 75,\r\n  82 (1993) (quoting State v. Cody, 180 S.C. 417, 423, 186 S.E. 165, 167\r\n  (1936)).Â  &quot;A material variance between charge and proof entitles the\r\n  defendant to a directed verdict; such a variance is not material if it is not\r\n  an element of the offense.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted); see 41\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Indictments &amp; Informations Â§ 252 (2005) (stating that\r\n  one of the two ways an indictment can be improperly modified is through &quot;a\r\n  variance, whereby the charging terms of the indictment are left unaltered, but\r\n  the evidence offered at trial proves facts materially different from those\r\n  alleged in the indictment&quot;). \r\nÂ &quot;[W]hile a conviction may be sustained under an\r\n  indictment which is defective because it omits essential elements of the\r\n  offense, such is not true when the indictment facially charges a complete\r\n  offense and the State presents evidence which convicts under a different theory\r\n  than that alleged.&quot;Â  Thomason v. State, 892 S.W.2d 8, 11 (Tex. Crim.\r\n  App. 1994) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;A conviction under the latter\r\n  circumstance violates principles of due process . . . because the State has\r\n  failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute\r\n  the crime with which a defendant was charged.&quot;Â  Id. (citations\r\n  omitted); see 41 Am. Jur. 2d Indictments &amp; Informations Â§ 256\r\n  (2005) (&quot;A material variance that violates a defendant's substantial right\r\n  to be tried only on charges presented in an indictment constitutes fatal error\r\n  and warrants a reversal on an appeal of a judgment of conviction of the offense\r\n  not charged in the indictment.&quot;).\r\nIn a case involving similar facts to the instant case,\r\n  the Texas Court of Appeals found error in the trial judge's jury instructions\r\n  that permitted the jury to convict the defendant of an act not alleged in the\r\n  indictment.Â  Castillo v. State, 7 S.W.3d 253 (Tex. Ct. App. 1999).Â  In Castillo,\r\n  the defendant was charged with the felony offense of\r\n  intentionally and knowingly causing serious bodily injury to a child and\r\n  convicted of the lesser-included offense of reckless injury to a child pursuant\r\n  to section 22.04(a)(1) of the Texas Penal Code.Â  Id.; Tex. Penal Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 22.04(a)(1) (1994) (&quot;A person commits an offense if he\r\n  intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, by act or\r\n  intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly by omission, causes a child . . .\r\n  serious bodily injury.&quot;).Â  The one-count indictment charging Castillo with\r\n  this offense provided that Castillo:\r\n\r\n  [d]id then and there intentionally and knowingly cause\r\n    serious bodily injury to Triston Castillo, a child 14 years or younger by then\r\n    and there striking the child with a deadly weapon, to wit:Â  the defendant's\r\n    hands or by striking the child's head against a deadly weapon, to wit:Â  a wall\r\n    or a floor.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 255.Â Â  In prefacing its analysis, the Texas Court\r\n  of Appeals noted that &quot;[b]y including a more specific description, the\r\n  State undertook the burden of proving the specific allegations to obtain a\r\n  conviction.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nAt trial, the child's mother\r\n  testified that the morning the child was taken to the hospital, she was taking\r\n  a shower when she heard the child &quot;crying out loudly&quot; while in\r\n  Castillo's care.Â  When she went to check on the child, she observed that he was\r\n  &quot;in a daze,&quot; &quot;seizing,&quot; and &quot;limp.&quot;Â  Id. at 255.Â  Although Castillo admitted to shaking the child because he was having\r\n  difficulty breathing, he expressly denied that the child hit or struck a wall.Â  Id. at 257.\r\nOn appeal, Castillo raised\r\n  several issues, including an argument that the trial judge egregiously erred by\r\n  adding, through a lesser-included offense charge, a theory of prosecution\r\n  (&quot;shaking&quot;) that was not supported by the indictment.Â  Id. at\r\n  254.Â  The Texas Court of Appeals agreed with Castillo's argument, finding the\r\n  trial court erred in &quot;enlarging&quot; the indictment by adding\r\n  &quot;shaking&quot; as an additional manner and means of committing the charged\r\n  offense. Â Id. at 260.Â  In so ruling, the court recognized that a\r\n  defendant may only be tried and convicted of the crimes alleged in the\r\n  indictment and the State is bound by the theory alleged in the indictment.Â  Id. at 258-59.[6]\r\nIn light of its holding, the\r\n  court declined to reach Castillo's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.Â \r\n  The court, however, noted the claim would &quot;loom large on the scene, given\r\n  the failure to move for an instructed verdict and to object to the charge which\r\n  enlarged the indictment.&quot;Â  Id. at 262. \r\nWe agree with the reasoning in Castillo and\r\n  apply its analysis to the facts of the instant case. Â We conclude that the\r\n  trial judge's instructions improperly &quot;enlarged&quot; the indictment by\r\n  instructing the jury that it could convict Bailey of a crime not alleged in the\r\n  indictment.\r\nHere, the indictment charging Bailey with homicide by\r\n  child abuse specifically alleged that Bailey &quot;inflicted upon [Victim]\r\n  physical injuries to his abdomen resulting in exsanguination and consequently\r\n  the death of the child.&quot;Â  By its express terms, the indictment alleged\r\n  that Bailey's &quot;act&quot; resulted in Victim's death.Â  Significantly, it\r\n  did not allege that Victim's death was the result of an &quot;omission&quot; on\r\n  the part of Bailey.Â  \r\nThus, the indictment apprised Bailey that he had to\r\n  defend only against the allegation that he inflicted the physical injuries\r\n  resulting in Victim's death.Â  See Evans v. State, 363 S.C. 495,\r\n  508, 611 S.E.2d 510, 517 (2005) (&quot;The primary\r\n  purposes of an indictment are to put the defendant on notice of what he is\r\n  called upon to answer, i.e., to apprise him of the elements of the\r\n  offense and to allow him to decide whether to plead guilty or stand trial, and\r\n  to enable the circuit court to know what judgment to pronounce if the defendant\r\n  is convicted.&quot;); State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 102, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 494, 500 (2005) (&quot;The indictment is a notice document.&quot;).Â Â  Â Â \r\nA careful review of the jury's questions and the\r\n  ensuing discussion with the judge reveals that the jury focused on the terms of\r\n  the indictment and recognized the alternative elements in the homicide by child\r\n  abuse statute, i.e., an &quot;act&quot; versus an &quot;omission.&quot;Â \r\n  The foreman of the jury then stated the jury found &quot;no evidence&quot; that\r\n  Bailey struck the Victim.[7]Â \r\n  Based on this statement and the reference to the last line of the indictment,\r\n  it is evident the jury was inquiring as to whether a finding of\r\n  &quot;neglect&quot; on the part of Bailey was sufficient for a conviction under\r\n  the statute.\r\nThe judge's supplemental instructions, which were\r\n  confusing and contradictory, resulted in the erroneous directive that the jury\r\n  could find Bailey guilty of homicide by child abuse if it found an act of\r\n  &quot;abuse or neglect.&quot;Â  Such an instruction was in direct\r\n  contravention of the specific act alleged in the indictment and, thus,\r\n  constituted a material variance or a &quot;constructive amendment&quot; to the\r\n  indictment.\r\nWe find that trial counsel not only failed to object\r\n  to these jury instructions, but also acquiesced in the judge's erroneous interpretation.Â \r\n  Thus, counsel's failure to object did not constitute a valid trial strategy.Â  Cf. Padgett v. State, 324 S.C. 22, 484 S.E.2d 101 (1997) (finding trial\r\n  counsel's failure to challenge first-degree burglary indictment did not\r\n  constitute valid trial strategy where counsel did not recognize the distinction\r\n  between a &quot;barn&quot; and a &quot;dwelling&quot; for the purposes of\r\n  first-degree burglary).\r\nHaving found that trial counsel's performance was\r\n  deficient, the question becomes whether Bailey was prejudiced by counsel's\r\n  errors.[8]Â \r\n  Because the supplemental instructions created a material variance between the\r\n  State's evidence and the allegations in the indictment, we conclude that Bailey\r\n  was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to object as this deficiency undermined\r\n  confidence in the outcome of his trial.Â  Accordingly, we hold trial counsel\r\n  rendered ineffective assistance.Â  See McKnight v. State, 378 S.C.\r\n  33, 48-49, 661 S.E.2d 354, 361-62 (2008) (finding trial counsel rendered\r\n  ineffective assistance when she failed to object to the supplemental jury\r\n  charge on the measure of criminal intent required for a conviction under the Homicide\r\n  by Child Abuse statute; reasoning that the supplemental charge:Â  (1) did not\r\n  clarify the particular mental state and served to &quot;further confuse the\r\n  jury;&quot; (2) &quot;attained a special significance in the minds of the\r\n  jurors;&quot; and (3) was &quot;prejudicial in fact&quot; as the jury returned\r\n  a guilty verdict five minutes after the supplemental charge).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nIn conclusion, we find Bailey's issue was preserved\r\n  for appellate review as it was raised to and ruled upon by the PCR judge.Â  In\r\n  terms of the merits, we hold trial counsel was deficient in failing to object\r\n  to the supplemental jury instructions as the judge perpetuated the jury's\r\n  confusion that they could convict Bailey of homicide by child abuse based on an\r\n  unindicted allegation of neglect.Â  We find that a confluence of the lone specific\r\n  allegation of physical abuse in the indictment and the jury's expressed\r\n  confusion about the necessity of evidence of physical abuse by Bailey with the insufficient\r\n  jury instructions created a structural due process defect that deprived Bailey\r\n  of a fair trial.Â  We conclude that Bailey was prejudiced by counsel's deficient\r\n  performance.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the order of the PCR judge and remand for\r\n  a new trial.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C.

Allen,\r\n  a child two (2) years of age, while committing child abuse or neglect as\r\n  defined by South Carolina Code Section 20-7-490, and the death of said child\r\n  occurred under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life,\r\n  in that Lucas Lorenzo Bailey was responsible for the welfare of said child and\r\n  the defendant did inflict physical harm to the child, to wit:Â  The defendant\r\n    inflicted upon said child physical injuries to his abdomen resulting in\r\n    exsanguination and consequently the death of the child.\r\n[5]Â  We take this opportunity to caution the bench\r\n  against engaging in off-the-record discussions with members of the jury.Â  Here,\r\n  the record does not reveal whether the attorneys were present during the\r\n  exchange that culminated in the jury charge regarding proximate cause.Â  Thus,\r\n  we are troubled that the decision regarding the jury instruction may have been\r\n  made without the judge conferring with the attorneys.Â  Because this was not an\r\n  issue raised for our consideration on appeal, we do not address any arguments\r\n  challenging the procedure employed by the judge.Â  However, we emphasize that we\r\n  do not condone a judge's off-the-record discussion with a juror.\r\n[6]Â  Notably, the court stated in its conclusion that its\r\n  decision did not prevent &quot;the State from seeking a new indictment charging\r\n  injury to a child and alleging a different manner and means of committing the\r\n  offense such as 'shaking,' and trying appellant on the new indictment.&quot;Â  Id. at 262.\r\n[7]Â  By his statement, the foreman was conveying the\r\n  jury's deliberations as to whether there was &quot;direct evidence&quot; that\r\n  Bailey struck Victim.Â  Thus, we believe it would have been prudent and more\r\n  appropriate for the trial judge to instruct the jury on &quot;circumstantial\r\n  evidence&quot; in order to resolve the jury's confusion.\r\n[8]Â  We reject any contention that the Court of Appeals'\r\n  opinion affirming Bailey's conviction negates a finding of prejudice as the\r\n  court only considered the evidence in the context of a directed verdict\r\n  motion.Â  Although we agree there was sufficient evidence to submit the case to\r\n  the jury, the issue in this case requires a consideration of the evidence after the submission of the case to the jury.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26976","title":"State v.

there were four people in the car\r\n  in Rock Hill.Â  Defense counsel pointed out that on the night of his arrest\r\n  Crisco told the investigator that only Harris and Thompson accompanied him to\r\n  Rock Hill.Â  When defense counsel pressed him about exactly who was in the car\r\n  in Rock Hill, Crisco responded:\r\nWe all\r\n  came, but the only ones that really had something to do with the robbery was\r\n  me, Jamie, and Woodrow.Â  We was the only ones that had something to do with the\r\n  robbery, 'cause Jamie knew about [the bingo hall], and me and Woodrow went in\r\n  and done it.\r\nÂ When defense counsel asked\r\n  Crisco whether he knew Petitioner, the following exchange took place:\r\n\r\n  Counsel: But you're testifying today after pleading\r\n    guilty yesterday that that person was Najjar Byers?\r\n  Crisco:Â  Â That's what they said in the motions that it\r\n    was Najjar Byers.\r\n  Counsel: When you say that's what they said in the\r\n    motions, what do you mean?\r\n  Crisco: Â Â Â  In the motion of discovery.Â  They had his\r\n    name in it.\r\n  Counsel:  Who had his name in it?\r\n  Crisco:Â Â Â Â  The police and Woodrow Thompson.Â  So I\r\n    know [Woodrow] wasn't high on no drugs, so I know he know who he is.\r\n  Counsel:  So what you're saying is the reason you\r\n    think that was Najjar Byers is because that's what the police put in their\r\n    report?\r\n  Crisco: Â Â Â  Yes, sir; yes, sir.\r\n  Counsel:  Your Honor, I would move to strike any of\r\n    his testimony about Najjar Byers.Â  He's been relying on the police report.\r\n  Court: Â Â Â Â  Counsel, denied.Â  That's not a proper\r\n    motion.Â  His testimony stands for itself.\r\n  Counsel: Okay.Â  But you have no other independent\r\n    recollection of Najjar Byers being in the car?\r\n  Crisco:Â Â Â Â  No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Thompson,\r\n  Petitioner's cousin, was less than enlightening.Â  Thompson refused to testify\r\n  about any events that occurred in South Carolina.Â  Thompson did state, however,\r\n  that he drove around with his girlfriend in Charlotte earlier that day, but\r\n  that Harris, Crisco, and Petitioner got in the car with him when it was getting\r\n  dark.Â  Thompson also confirmed he was arrested with the same people he had been\r\n  riding with earlier that evening, and at the time the police officer stopped\r\n  him, no one had gotten in or out of his car within at least the past fifteen\r\n  minutes.Â  \r\nThe investigator to the crime\r\n  did not find any fingerprints linking Petitioner to the crime.Â  The State\r\n  presented three eye witnesses who worked at the bingo hall.Â  Two of these\r\n  witnesses were inside the bingo hall at the time of the robbery and both\r\n  testified one man went behind the counter to take the cash till, while another\r\n  man stood at the door.Â  Neither witness could identify the men.Â  The third\r\n  witness testified he was outside the bingo hall parking cars and a man held a\r\n  gun to his back and told him to get on his knees.Â  Similarly, that witness\r\n  could not identify the gunman.\r\nPetitioner's mother (Ms.\r\n  Johnson), father (Mr. Byers), and ex-girlfriend testified for Petitioner as\r\n  alibi witnesses.Â  Ms. Johnson stated she was at home with Petitioner until\r\n  approximately 8:45 p.m. on the evening of his arrest when she left her home to\r\n  visit her sister.Â  She stated Petitioner and his girlfriend were at the house\r\n  when she left.Â  Ms. Johnson testified she spoke to Petitioner several times during\r\n  the evening on his cell phone and, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Petitioner told\r\n  her he was at his father's house.Â  Petitioner's ex-girlfriend testified Petitioner\r\n  left his home shortly after 9:00 p.m.Â  She stated she did not know where he was\r\n  going but he did not indicate he was going anywhere with Crisco, Harris, or\r\n  Thompson.Â  Mr. Byers testified he went to his girlfriend's house at\r\n  approximately 9:45 that evening and Petitioner was waiting for him on the front\r\n  porch.Â  Mr. Byers testified he dropped Petitioner at a bar in downtown\r\n  Charlotte around 10:00 p.m.Â  \r\nDefense counsel moved for a\r\n  directed verdict after the State presented its case, and again after at the\r\n  close of all the evidence.Â  The circuit court judge denied both motions.Â  The\r\n  jury found Petitioner guilty of armed robbery and criminal conspiracy, but\r\n  acquitted him on the charge of possession of a firearm during the commission of\r\n  a violent crime.Â  The circuit court judge sentenced Petitioner to concurrent terms\r\n  of twelve years imprisonment for armed robbery and five years imprisonment for\r\n  criminal conspiracy. Â Â  \r\nThe court of appeals affirmed\r\n  the circuit court in a Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, per curiam opinion.Â  This case is\r\n  before the Court pursuant to Rule 242(a), SCACR.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.&nbsp;Whether Petitioner's objection\r\n  to the circuit court's admission of hearsay testimony was timely and specific.\r\nII.&nbsp; Whether it was harmless error\r\n  for the circuit court to admit certain hearsay testimony.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose\r\n  decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Williams, 386 S.C. 503, 509, 690 S.E.2d 62, 65 (2010).Â  &quot;An abuse\r\n  of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467\r\n  (2000).Â  To warrant reversal based on the wrongful admission of evidence, the\r\n  complaining party must prove resulting prejudice. Vaught v. A.O. Hardee\r\n    &amp; Sons, Inc.,&nbsp;366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 375&nbsp;(2005).Â  Prejudice occurs when there is reasonable probability the\r\n      wrongly admitted evidence influenced the jury's verdict.Â  Id.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;Whether Petitioner's\r\n  Objection was Timely and Specific\r\nPetitioner argues the motion to strike Crisco's\r\n  hearsay testimony was timely and specific and therefore, preserved for review.Â \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nFor an objection to be preserved for appellate review,\r\n  the objection must be made at the time the evidence is presented, State v.\r\n    Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 42, 479 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1996), and with sufficient\r\n  specificity to inform the circuit court judge of the point being urged by the\r\n  objector, Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,&nbsp;330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731,\r\n  733&nbsp;(1998).Â  When a witness answers a question before an objection is\r\n  made, the objecting party must make a motion to strike the answer to preserve\r\n  the issue of that statement's admissibility.Â  See State v. Saltz, 346\r\n  S.C. 114, 129, 551 S.E.2d 240, 248 (2001) (finding a motion to strike was\r\n  unnecessary because the objection to the hearsay testimony had been overruled).\r\nIn this case, defense counsel motioned to strike\r\n  Crisco's statement immediately after Crisco represented he was relying on a\r\n  discovery motion to identify Petitioner.Â  With the greatest respect for the\r\n  learned opinion of the court of appeals, we do not understand the basis for its\r\n  conclusion that counsel's motion to strike was not contemporaneously made.\r\nIn upholding the circuit court's decision to deny\r\n  Petitioner's motion to strike, the court of appeals quoted the proposition from State v. Rice, &quot;[u]nless an objection is made at the time the\r\n  evidence is offered and a final ruling made, the issue is not preserved for\r\n  review.&quot;Â  375 S.C. at 322-23, 652 S.E.2d at 419.Â  In that case, trial\r\n  counsel motioned to strike certain testimony immediately after the witness made\r\n  the alleged hearsay statement.Â  Id.Â  The court of appeals determined the\r\n  objection was untimely by placing emphasis on the manner in which trial counsel\r\n  raised issue with the statement: &quot;Trial counsel did not object when\r\n  Officer Smith made the alleged hearsay statement.Â  Instead, counsel made a\r\n  motion to strike . . . . Here, trial counsel never actually made an objection,\r\n  only a motion to strike.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, the State argues because Petitioner's\r\n  motion to strike was not preceded by an objection, there was no contemporaneous\r\n  objection.Â  The rationale behind the requirement of a contemporaneous objection\r\n  is to &quot;enable[] trial judges to make reasoned decisions by appropriately\r\n  developing issues by way of argument, both for or against any particular legal\r\n  proposition.&quot;Â  State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 67, 406 S.E.2d 315,\r\n  327 (1991).Â  In our opinion, defense counsel's purpose would not have been made\r\n  clearer had he used the word &quot;objection&quot; before making a motion to\r\n  strike.Â Â Â  Moreover, the South Carolina Rules of Evidence state that an error\r\n  may not be found for the wrongful admission of evidence unless &quot;a timely\r\n  objection or motion to strike appears of record.&quot; Â Rule 103(a)(1),\r\n  SCRE (emphasis added).Â  Under the Rules of Evidence, Petitioner clearly\r\n  preserved the issue of admissibility by moving to strike the hearsay testimony.Â \r\n  To the extent State v. Rice stands for the proposition that preservation\r\n  of an error in admitting evidence can only be accomplished if trial counsel\r\n  follows the precise procedure of making an objection followed by a motion to\r\n  strike, we overrule that proposition.Â  \r\nAt oral argument, the State argued defense counsel's\r\n  motion to strike was not timely because prior to Crisco making the statement at\r\n  issue, he twice stated he was relying on other documents to recall the events\r\n  of that evening.Â  The two prior statements to which the State refers do not\r\n  relate to the identification of Petitioner, which was crucial to Petitioner's\r\n  guilt.Â  Rather, those statements referred to the amount of the robbery proceeds\r\n  Crisco gave Harris, and the time Crisco believed he robbed the bingo hall. Â This\r\n  information was not the primary piece of evidence Petitioner was seeking to\r\n  elicit from Crisco.Â  Therefore, we do not accept the State's argument that Petitioner's\r\n  failure to object to those statements renders Petitioner's motion to strike\r\n  untimely. Â The first time Crisco made a hearsay statement that was prejudicial\r\n  to Petitioner, defense counsel motioned to strike.Â  For this reason, we find\r\n  the objection was timely.\r\nAdditionally, we find defense counsel's motion to\r\n  strike Crisco's testimony was sufficiently specific to preserve the issue of\r\n  admissibility for review.[1]Â \r\n  For an admissibility error to be preserved, the objection must include a\r\n  specific ground &quot;if the specific ground was not apparent from the\r\n  context.&quot;Â  Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE.Â  When supported by context, &quot;[a]\r\n  party need not use the exact name of a legal doctrine . . . , but it must be\r\n  clear the argument has been presented on that ground.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Stahlnecker, 386 S.C. 609, 617, 690 S.E.2d 565, 570 (2010).Â  In this case,\r\n  Crisco admitted on the stand he relied on a discovery motion for the\r\n  identification of Petitioner.Â  Defense counsel moved to strike all of Crisco's\r\n  testimony about Petitioner on the ground that &quot;[h]e's been relying on the\r\n  police report.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nThe State analogized this case to State v. Rice where trial counsel made a motion to strike, stating &quot;[h]e's talking about\r\n  what someone else did.&quot;Â  375 S.C. at 322, 652 S.E.2d at 419.Â  The court of\r\n  appeals in that case found the ground for objection was not apparent from the\r\n  context because it appeared that trial counsel was concerned with whether the\r\n  testifying officer's testimony was based on personal knowledge.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The determination of whether an objection is apparent from the context of\r\n  witness examination is factually driven.Â  Therefore, we do not believe State\r\n    v. Rice is a measuring stick for judging the specificity of the motion to\r\n  strike in this case.Â  Although defense counsel did not state his ground for\r\n  objection as hearsay, we believe it was apparent from the context of the cross-examination\r\n  that defense counsel was objecting to the hearsay nature of Crisco's statement\r\n  under Rule 802, SCRE.Â  Thus, we conclude Petitioner's motion to strike Crisco's\r\n  testimony was preserved for our review because it was both timely and specific.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the circuit court's denial of Petitioner's motion to strike was\r\n  error under Rule 801(c), SCRE (&quot;'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one\r\n  made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\r\n  evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.&quot;).\r\n II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harmless Error\r\nPetitioner argues the admission of Crisco's hearsay testimony\r\n  was prejudicial because Crisco's testimony comprised the State's only evidence\r\n  placing Petitioner in the vehicle at the time of the robbery.Â  We agree that without\r\n  Crisco's testimony, the jury had little evidence from which to conclude\r\n  Petitioner was in the vehicle at the time of the robbery.Â  Therefore, we find it\r\n  was prejudicial error to admit Crisco's testimony, and we reverse the\r\n  conviction on that ground.\r\n&quot;Generally, appellate\r\n  courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting\r\n  the result.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 212, 631 S.E.2d 262,\r\n  267 (2006).Â  Where &quot;guilt has been conclusively proven by competent\r\n  evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached,&quot; an\r\n  insubstantial error that does not affect the result of the trial is considered\r\n  harmless.Â  Id.Â  A harmless error analysis is contextual and specific to\r\n  the circumstances of the case: &quot;No definite rule of law governs [a finding\r\n  of harmless error]; rather the materiality and prejudicial character of the\r\n  error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  Error is\r\n  harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.&quot;\r\n  Â State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 193-94, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  \r\nIn our opinion, Crisco's testimony concerning\r\n  Petitioner reasonably affected the result of the trial.Â  Without Crisco's\r\n  testimony, the jury was left to consider the following evidence:Â  Police\r\n  stopped the vehicle approximately one hour after the robbery occurred, and it\r\n  is undisputed Petitioner was in the car.Â  Thompson testified Petitioner was\r\n  with him in the car when it was &quot;getting toward dark,&quot; and no one got\r\n  in or out of the car for at least fifteen minutes before being stopped by the\r\n  police officer.Â  Still, the State was unable to elicit any direct statement\r\n  from Thompson that Petitioner was in the car with him at the time of the\r\n  robbery.Â  Â The officer who stopped the vehicle testified he was told a precinct\r\n  on the South Carolina-North Carolina border was on the lookout for a &quot;blue\r\n  unknown type vehicle occupied by four black males that committed an armed\r\n  robbery.&quot;Â  However, the State produced the testimony of three witnesses to\r\n  the crime, and their cumulative testimony only identified three actors in the\r\n  robberyâ€”two men entered the bingo hall, while one man held an employee at\r\n  gunpoint in the parking lot.Â  The on-scene investigator could not link any\r\n  fingerprints to Petitioner.Â  Lastly, Mr. Byers provided Petitioner an alibi,\r\n  stating he dropped Petitioner off at a bar in downtown Charlotte around 10:00\r\n  p.m. \r\nOn balance, we believe that without Crisco's\r\n  testimony, another rational conclusion could have been reached by the jury.Â  We\r\n  find it telling that during deliberation the jury asked for a replay of all of\r\n  Crisco's testimony, but only the testimony of Thompson that related to events\r\n  in North Carolina.Â  Therefore, we hold the wrongful admission of Crisco's\r\n  hearsay testimony was prejudicial to Petitioner, and we reverse on that ground.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we hold that Petitioner's\r\n  objection to Crisco's testimony was properly preserved for our review, and\r\n  further find the court of appeals erred in affirming the circuit court judge's\r\n  admission of Crisco's hearsay testimony.Â  Because we believe the admission of\r\n  this testimony was prejudicial to Petitioner, we reverse Petitioner's\r\n  conviction.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The court of appeals did not rule on whether defense\r\n  counsel's motion to strike was specific, but instead focused on the timeliness\r\n  of the motion.Â  Petitioner's primary argument to the court of appeals was that\r\n  the motion to strike was specific.Â  In a Petition for Rehearing, Petitioner\r\n  again asked the court to determine the issue of specificity, but that petition\r\n  was denied.Â  Therefore, the specificity issue is preserved for our review.Â  As\r\n  an additional issue, Petitioner argues that because the timeliness of\r\n  Petitioner's motion was not raised to the court of appeals, the court erred in\r\n  ruling the issue unpreserved on the ground of timeliness.Â  We disagree.Â  An\r\n  appellate court may affirm a judgment upon any ground appearing in the record\r\n  on appeal, Rule 220(c), SCACR; and likewise, a respondent may ask the court to\r\n  affirm on any ground appearing therein.Â  Rule 208(b)(2), SCACR.Â  Although\r\n  neither party specifically argued Petitioner's motion to strike was untimely,\r\n  the State supported its preservation argument with a factual comparison to State\r\n    v. Rice, 375 S.C. at 302, 652 S.E.2d at 419, where the court of appeals\r\n  found an objection unpreserved due to an untimely objection.Â  Because the\r\n  timeliness issue was reasonably clear from the State's brief before the court\r\n  of appeals, we believe the court of appeals was at liberty to rule the\r\n  objection was unpreserved on the basis of timeliness.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26977","title":"Edwards v.

DuRant, South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n        Assistant Attorney General Ashley McMahan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN: We granted certiorari to review the circuit court's denial of post conviction relief (PCR) to Terrence Edwards (Petitioner).&nbsp;\r\nPetitioner asserts the circuit court erred in finding his trial counsel's decision to not interview and call as a witness Petitioner's co-defendant was not\r\ndeficient performance or prejudicial.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAn Abbeville County grand jury indicted Petitioner and Sergio Marshall on the following charges: (1) murder of Jonathan Blackston; (2) armed robbery of\r\nBlackston; (3) grand larceny of a motor vehicle; (4) possession of a firearm by a person under twenty-one years of age; and (5) possession of a firearm during\r\nthe commission of a violent felony.&nbsp; Marshall pled guilty to all five charges.&nbsp; Petitioner proceeded to trial, during which he was represented by\r\ncounsel.&nbsp; Prior to Petitioner's trial, defense counsel did not interview Marshall.&nbsp; Additionally, counsel did not call Marshall to testify during the\r\ntrial itself.\r\nThe evidence introduced at Petitioner's trial showed Marshall shot Blackston twice, once in the head and once in the arm.&nbsp; At some point during the\r\naltercation, but before he died, Blackston also received strong blows to his face that were likely from a hand or a foot.&nbsp; Petitioner admitted to law\r\nenforcement he helped Marshall hide Blackston's body under a nearby pile of logs in the field where he was shot.&nbsp; Afterwards, Petitioner was found with\r\ncash from Blackston's wallet on his person, some of which he had already spent at the county fair, Blackston's wallet in the trunk of his car, and Blackston's\r\nbreath spray hidden under his mattress.&nbsp; The Solicitor did not try Petitioner's case on the theory of principal liability, nor did he suggest that\r\nPetitioner was the shooter.&nbsp; Instead, he presented the case on the theory of accomplice liability based on the indisputable evidence of Petitioner's\r\ninvolvement in at least some aspects of the crimes.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all five charges.[1]&nbsp;\r\nThe court of appeals affirmed Petitioner's convictions on direct appeal. State v. Edwards, Op. No. 2005-UP-256 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Apr. 7, 2005).&nbsp;\r\nThis court denied certiorari to review the convictions.\r\nIn his PCR application, Petitioner alleged his attorney was ineffective for failing to interview Marshall and call him as a witness.&nbsp; To support his\r\nargument, Petitioner called three witnesses to testify at the PCR hearing: Marshall, Petitioner himself, and his attorney.&nbsp; Marshall testified that despite\r\nbeing the only surviving witness to the crimes other than Petitioner, he was not called as a witness during Petitioner's trial.&nbsp; Marshall also testified\r\nthat had he been called as a witness during Petitioner's trial, he would have told the jury the shooting was an accident, he alone was the shooter, and\r\nPetitioner had no involvement in, and indeed was shocked by, the murder.&nbsp; During Petitioner's testimony, Petitioner accepted responsibility for some\r\nwrongdoing on the day of Blackston's murder but was steadfast in his denial of any participation in the murder itself.&nbsp; He further testified that he\r\nbelieved Marshall's testimony would have made a &quot;big difference&quot; at Petitioner's trial and he never told his attorney that he did not want Marshall to\r\ntestify.\r\nPetitioner's trial counsel admitted that he did not interview Marshall before Petitioner's trial.&nbsp; However, he was present at Marshall's guilty plea,\r\ngiving him an opportunity to observe Marshall in court, and retained a copy of Marshall's plea transcript.&nbsp; During his plea, Marshall was consistent in his\r\ndenial of Petitioner's involvement in the murder, but his version of the rest of the events changed no less than three times during his statement to the\r\ncourt.&nbsp; In fact, the plea court seemed poised to reject Marshall's plea as to the murder charge because he was unable to give a consistent recitation of\r\nthe facts.&nbsp; It was only when he finally was able to do soâ€”after being instructed to ignore any prior statements he made in court or to the policeâ€”that\r\nthe court accepted his plea.&nbsp; According to Petitioner's attorney, this final version of the facts, highlighting the accidental nature of the crimes and\r\nPetitioner's lack of involvement, was wholly consistent with the version given to law enforcement by Petitioner and introduced at Petitioner's trial through the\r\ntestimony of a SLED agent.\r\nDefense counsel testified that his decision to not call Marshall was a strategic one he made for two reasons.&nbsp; First, he testified that he actually\r\ndisagreed with Marshall's version of the facts presented at the plea hearing, stating, &quot;[I]t wasn't an accident if he's pleading guilty to\r\nmurder.&quot;&nbsp; Second, he expressed serious concerns about Marshall's ability to withstand cross examination by the Solicitor were he to testify.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough trial counsel did state that &quot;in retrospect&quot; and in &quot;hindsight&quot; he would want to reconsider calling Marshall, this belief had two\r\nimportant caveats: that Marshall's testimony at trial would be the same as it was at the PCR hearing and it would be tested with the same &quot;limited\r\ncross-examination.&quot;&nbsp; However, he then went on to state that in reality there would have been &quot;a lot of room on cross-examination&quot; had\r\nMarshall actually testified at Petitioner's trial.\r\nThe PCR judge determined that the attorney's decision to not call Marshall was &quot;a planned and calculated&quot; one and &quot;[o]nly in hindsight[] can\r\nthe failure to call Mr. Marshall seem as an error.&quot;&nbsp; He also determined that Petitioner failed to establish any resulting prejudice from his\r\nattorney's actions.&nbsp; Accordingly, he denied and dismissed with prejudice Petitioner's application.&nbsp; We granted certiorari.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a PCR court's decision, an appellate court is concerned only with whether there is any evidence of probative value that supports the decision. Kolle\r\nv. State, 386 S.C. 578, 589, 690 S.E.2d 73, 79 (2010).&nbsp; The appellate court will reverse the PCR court only where there is either no probative evidence\r\nto support the decision or the decision was controlled by an error of law. Id.&nbsp; In performing this analysis, the appellate court is to give great\r\ndeference to the PCR court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn order to receive relief for ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must make two showings.&nbsp; First, he must show that his trial counsel's\r\nperformance was deficient, meaning that &quot;counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the\r\nSixth Amendment.&quot; Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).&nbsp; Second, he must demonstrate that this deficiency prejudiced him to the\r\npoint that he was deprived of a fair trial whose result is reliable. Id.\r\nI.&nbsp; Deficient Performance\r\nCounsel's performance under the first prong of the Strickland test is judged under the standard of &quot;reasonableness under prevailing professional\r\nnorms.&quot; Id. at 688.&nbsp; This Court has stated previously that criminal defense attorneys have a duty to undertake a reasonable investigation,\r\nwhich at a minimum includes interviewing potential witnesses and making an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case. Ard v. Catoe,\r\n372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007); see also McKnight v. State, 378 S.C. 33, 46, 661 S.E.2d 354, 360 (2008) (&quot;A criminal defense\r\nattorney has the duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to discover all reasonably available mitigation evidence and all reasonably available evidence\r\ntending to rebut any aggravating evidence introduced by the State.&quot;).\r\nHowever, &quot;[t]here is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all\r\nsignificant decisions in the case.&quot; Ard, 372 S.C. at 331, 642 S.E.2d at 596 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689).&nbsp; &quot;[W]hen counsel\r\narticulates a valid reason for employing a certain strategy, such conduct generally will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel.&nbsp; The\r\nvalidity of counsel's strategy is viewed under an 'objective standard of reasonableness.'&quot; Lounds v. State, 380 S.C. 454, 462, 670 S.E.2d 646, 650\r\n(2008).&nbsp; The United States Supreme Court has cautioned that &quot;every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight&quot; and evaluate\r\ncounsel's decisions at the time they were made. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.&nbsp; Accordingly, we must be wary of second-guessing trial counsel's\r\ntactics. Whitehead v. State, 308 S.C. 119, 122, 417 S.E.2d 529, 531 (1992).\r\nWhile our case law does provide that defense counsel must, at a minimum, interview potential witnesses, a strict adherence to that rule loses sight of the\r\ncontrolling standard for counsel's duty to investigate: reasonableness.&nbsp; Indeed, it would be an absurdity to require criminal defense lawyers to interview every\r\npotential witness when they can articulate reasonable grounds not to.&nbsp; When counsel makes such a reasonable decision, he will have fulfilled the duty he\r\nowes to his client.&nbsp; Petitioner would have this Court raise the duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to include creating &quot;a simulated trial\r\nsituation&quot; for every witness, subjecting them all to mock cross-examination.&nbsp; Our case law has never required so much of defense counsel, and we\r\ndecline to so extend it.&nbsp; So long as a defendant's attorney conducts a reasonable investigation, including interviewing potential witnesses when it is\r\nreasonable to do so, his performance will not be deficient. &nbsp;Other states are in accord. See, e.g., Murray v. Griffith, 416 S.E.2d 219, 222 (Va.\r\n1992) (finding counsel's failure to interview a particular witness not deficient where the witness's testimony would have been cumulative and witness himself\r\ncould have been harmful to the defense); Daniels v. State, 676 S.E.2d 13, 18 (Ga. Ct. App. 2009) (holding counsel's failure to interview witnesses did\r\nnot amount to deficient performance where he had read their prior statements, reviewed the state's file in the matter, was experienced in trying similar cases,\r\nwas familiar with the applicable law, and was not surprised by other evidence adduced at trial); People v. Caballero, 459 N.W.2d 80, 82-83 (Mich. Ct.\r\nApp. 1990) (&quot;Even the failure to interview witnesses does not itself establish inadequate preparation.&nbsp; It must be shown that the failure resulted in\r\ncounsel's ignorance of valuable evidence which would have substantially benefited the accused.&quot;).\r\nAlthough Petitioner's attorney admittedly did not interview Marshall, he did observe Marshall at the plea hearing.&nbsp; Based on this observation, counsel\r\nconcluded as a strategic matter that he was not going to call Marshall as a witness.&nbsp; Chief among the reasons for that decision were Marshall's ability to\r\nwithstand cross-examination due to his prior vacillation and the cumulative nature of his testimony.&nbsp; Additionally, Petitioner's attorney knew entirely\r\nconsistent evidence would be presented through Petitioner's statement to the police.&nbsp; A witness's credibility and demeanor is crucial to an attorney's\r\ntrial strategy, and an attorney cannot be said to be deficient if there is evidence to support his decision to not call a witness with serious credibility\r\nquestions, even if that witness is a co-defendant. See Jackson v. State, 329 S.C. 345, 351-52, 495 S.E.2d 768, 771 (1998) (holding counsel had a valid\r\nstrategic reason for not calling a co-defendant as a witness where the co-defendant's credibility was a concern and the same evidence would be presented through\r\nanother witness); Stokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546, 548, 419 S.E.2d 778, 779 (1992) (finding counsel's decision to not call witnesses reasonable where their\r\ntestimony would have been of no value to the case and they made inconsistent statements in the past).\r\nGiven this Court's admonition against second-guessing counsel's trial strategy, Marshall's performance and the cumulative nature of his testimony provide\r\nprobative evidence under our prevailing law to support the PCR court's determination that Petitioner's attorney articulated a valid trial strategy when he chose\r\nnot to call Marshall as a witness.&nbsp; Because Petitioner's attorney had valid reasons for not calling Marshall to testify, it would be futile and\r\nunreasonable to also require defense counsel to interview him to satisfy the Sixth Amendment because doing so would serve no purpose in connection with\r\nPetitioner's defense.&nbsp; To achieve our goal of &quot;eliminat[ing] the distorting effects of hindsight,&quot; we must disregard the attorney's statements\r\nthat he would now reconsider calling Marshall.&nbsp; Focusing our attention on what Petitioner's counsel knew at the time he made his decisions to neither\r\ninterview nor call Marshall, we find ample probative evidence to sustain the PCR court's ruling that he did not render deficient performance.\r\nII.&nbsp; Prejudice\r\nMoreover, even were we to hold that Petitioner's counsel's performance was deficient, Petitioner suffered no prejudice.&nbsp; To establish the requisite\r\nprejudice necessary to prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner must demonstrate that his attorney's errors had an effect on the judgment\r\nagainst him. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691.&nbsp; A PCR applicant &quot;must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\r\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. &nbsp;A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\r\nconfidence in the outcome.&quot; Id. at 694.&nbsp; In other words, he must show that &quot;the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting\r\nguilt.&quot; Id. at 695.&nbsp; We previously have held where evidence produced during PCR proceedings is cumulative to or does not otherwise aid evidence\r\nintroduced at trial, no prejudice results from counsel's failure to bring it forward. See Jackson, 329 S.C. at 350-51, 495 S.E.2d at 770-71; Glover v.\r\nState, 318 S.C. 496, 498, 458 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1995); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 118-19, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625-26 (1989).\r\nPetitioner alleges that he was prejudiced because if the jury heard Marshall's testimony that Marshall was the lone gunman and Petitioner had no involvement\r\nwhatsoever, there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have had a reasonable doubt as to Petitioner's guilt.[2]&nbsp;\r\nHowever, this argument belies the evidence that the facts proffered by Marshall at the PCR hearing are wholly consistent with the evidence presented at\r\nPetitioner's trial.&nbsp; As his attorney acknowledged, the statement Petitioner gave to the police, and introduced at trial through a SLED agent, details the\r\npurported accidental nature of the shooting and Petitioner's lack of involvement.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case before us today is not one where the proffered evidence\r\nwould have exonerated Petitioner had it been presented.&nbsp; Instead, Marshall's testimony simply would have been cumulative to evidence already introduced\r\nthrough other witnesses.&nbsp; While Petitioner's attorney did believe that Marshall's testimony probably would have affected the jury's decision, that belief\r\nwas premised on the conditions that the testimony would be the same as it was during the PCR hearing and subject to the same &quot;limited\r\ncross-examination.&quot;&nbsp; However, counsel later conceded that he truly believed Marshall's testimony at Petitioner's trial would open the door for &quot;a\r\nlot&quot; of cross-examination, thereby seriously undermining the chance that the jury would have been persuaded by his story.\r\nIn Jackson v. State, 329 S.C. 345, 495 S.E.2d 768 (1998), we considered a set of facts strikingly similar to those before us today.&nbsp; In Jackson,\r\nthe PCR applicant claimed his trial counsel was deficient for failing to call the applicant's co-defendants as witnesses. Id. at 350, 495 S.E.2d at\r\n770.&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal, the State challenged the PCR court's finding of prejudice resulting from this decision. Id.&nbsp; The evidence showed that\r\ncounsel reviewed the co-defendants' statements, the co-defendants' version of the evidence was the same as the applicant's, and this evidence was presented\r\nseparately at trial through the testimony of a police officer. Id. at 350, 495 S.E.2d at 770-71.&nbsp; In the end, counsel made the decision to not call\r\nthe co-defendants because he &quot;didn't want to run the risk of calling them and having something go wrong.&quot; Id. at 350, 495 S.E.2d at 771.&nbsp;\r\nThis Court reversed the PCR court, finding there was no probative evidence of prejudice because the applicant failed to show that the proffered testimony would\r\nhave provided the jury with any additional information. Id. at 351, 495 S.E.2d at 771.&nbsp; Here, Petitioner's counsel attended Marshall's plea and kept\r\na copy of the transcript, Marshall's testimony was consistent with evidence already introduced at trial through a police officer, and the attorney had\r\nlegitimate concerns about Marshall's performance as a witness.\r\nWhile Marshall's statements may have served to corroborate Petitioner's testimony concerning the degree of his involvement in the crime, this benefit must be\r\nevaluated against the legitimate concerns regarding Marshall's credibility and the strong evidence of Petitioner's guilt.&nbsp; Those concerns run directly\r\ncounter to the possibility that the jury would have reached a different result had Marshall testified.&nbsp; With that and our limited &quot;any evidence&quot;\r\nstandard of review in mind, it is readily apparent from the record that there is probative evidence to support the PCR court's conclusion that Petitioner failed\r\nto establish the requisite prejudice for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ruling of the PCR court.\r\nTOAL, C.J. and KITTREDGE, J., concur.&nbsp; BEATTY, J., concurring in a separate opinion.&nbsp; PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:&nbsp; I concur in result only.&nbsp; In my view trial counsel was clearly deficient in his representation of petitioner.&nbsp;\r\nCounsel's failure to call co-defendant as a witness is irrational.&nbsp; Co-defendant testified at his guilty plea that petitioner had nothing to do with the\r\nmurder and was shocked by it.&nbsp; It is unreasonable to conclude that co-defendant's testimony would not have been very beneficial to petitioner.&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, in my view it is unreasonable to classify counsel's deficient performance as a reasonable trial strategy.\r\nDefense counsel gave two reasons for his strategic decision not to call co-defendant as a witness. The first reason was that he did not believe\r\nco-defendant's version of the facts because co-defendant gave several versions of the facts.&nbsp; However, neither version alleged that petitioner participated\r\nin the murder.&nbsp; The second reason was that he was concerned about co-defendant's ability to withstand cross-examination.&nbsp; Assuming that to be true,\r\nhow does this concern outweigh the exonerating testimony of the only eyewitness to the crime?&nbsp; Further, trial counsel's deficient performance is not\r\nameliorated by arguing that co-defendant's exonerating testimony was merely cumulative to evidence presented by a policeman.&nbsp; It should be noted that the\r\npoliceman's testimony was not corroborative, it merely restated petitioner's statement given at time of arrest.\r\nIn my view, trial counsel's performance was clearly deficient.&nbsp; However, I concur in the result reached by the majority because I do not believe that\r\nthe trial results would be different given the amount of circumstantial evidence against petitioner.&nbsp;\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; I agree with Justice Beatty that trial counsel's performance was deficient, but unlike him, and the majority, I cannot agree\r\nthere was sufficient circumstantial evidence that petitioner was an accomplice to murder such that I am confident that the jury's verdict would not have been\r\naffected by Marshall's testimony.&nbsp; Instead, in my view, the evidence that petitioner helped hide the victim's body, that he had the victim's wallet in his\r\ncar, had spent some of the victim's money and still had some on his person, and had the victim's breath spray under his mattress is evidence that petitioner may\r\nhave been an accessory after the fact, and circumstantial evidence that petitioner had engaged in an armed robbery, but not sufficient evidence of murder to\r\nfind that conviction reliable.&nbsp;\r\nI would grant petitioner post-conviction relief on the murder charge.\r\n\r\n[1] The circuit judge sentenced Petitioner to fifty-five years imprisonment, while Marshall received a total\r\nsentence of thirty-five years imprisonment following his guilty plea to the same offenses.&nbsp; Although we are troubled by the disparate sentences these\r\nco-defendants received from the same circuit judge, we have no power to address that disparity. See State v. Franklin, 267 S.C. 240, 246, 226 S.E.2d 896,\r\n898 (1976) (&quot;[T]his Court has no jurisdiction to review a sentence, provided it is within the limits provided by statute for the discretion of the trial\r\ncourt, and is not the result of prejudice, oppression or corrupt motive.&quot;).\r\n[2] Petitioner also alleges that had this evidence been presented, the Solicitor would not have had the\r\nopportunity to argue to the jury that Petitioner was the shooter as opposed to Marshall.&nbsp; After a thorough review of the record, we find no evidence to\r\nsupport Petitioner's contention that the Solicitor argued Petitioner shot Blackston.&nbsp; Rather, the record clearly shows the Solicitor argued the case on a\r\ntheory of accomplice liability, not principal liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26978","title":"Argoe v.

Factual/Procedural History\r\nPursuant to section 44-17-410\r\n  of the South Carolina Code,[2] Appellant's husband (Husband) filed an Application for Involuntary Emergency\r\n  Hospitalization for Mental Illness with the Orangeburg County Probate Court on\r\n  June 6, 2005.Â  \r\nOn June 6, 2005, Probate\r\n  Court Judge Pandora L. Jones-Glover issued an Order of Detention that\r\n  referenced section 44-17-430[3] of the South Carolina Code and provided that an &quot;officer of the peace take\r\n  the person [Appellant] alleged to be mentally ill into custody for a period of\r\n  [time] not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours, during which detention said person\r\n  shall be examined by a licensed physician.&quot;\r\nOn June 7, 2005, deputies\r\n  with the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Department transported Appellant to the\r\n  emergency room of The Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg (TRMC).Â  At 3:35\r\n  p.m., Appellant was given a physical and mental evaluation.Â  Appellant was\r\n  discharged at 5:13 p.m. with a diagnosis of &quot;Altered Mental Status&quot;\r\n  and instructions for her to return the following day for further evaluation. Â Subsequently,\r\n  Appellant was driven home by law enforcement.Â  \r\nOn June 8, 2005 at 3:00 p.m.,\r\n  Dr. Glenn Hooker, who evaluated Appellant at the Orangeburg Area Mental Health\r\n  Center, completed Part II of the Certificate of Licensed Physician Examination\r\n  for Emergency Admission pursuant to section 44-17-410(2) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code.Â  In this document, Dr. Hooker certified that inpatient psychiatric\r\n  hospitalization was medically necessary for Appellant and identified Aurora\r\n  Pavilion Behavioral Health Services (Aurora), a division of the Aiken Regional\r\n  Medical Center, as the facility that would accept Appellant for further\r\n  treatment.Â  Appellant's medical records verify that she was involuntarily\r\n  admitted to that facility on June 8, 2005 at 5:45 p.m.Â  An attending physician\r\n  at Aurora completed the requisite Physician Certification form stating that he\r\n  certified that &quot;the inpatient psychiatric hospital admission was medically\r\n  necessary for psychiatric treatment, which could reasonably be expected to\r\n  improve the patient's condition.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nOn June 9, 2005, due to health\r\n  insurance constraints, Appellant was transferred and admitted to Three Rivers Behavioral\r\n  Health, L.L.C. (Three Rivers).Â  Based on her initial psychiatric evaluation, which\r\n  was conducted by Dr. Phyllis Bryant-Mobley, a provisional diagnosis was made\r\n  that Appellant was suffering from bipolar disorder with manic and psychotic\r\n  features.Â  On June 10, 2005, Three Rivers completed the Notification of\r\n  Emergency Admission and Appointment of Designated Examiners.Â  \r\nOn June 13, 2005, Darlington\r\n  County[4] Probate Court Judge Marvin Lawson issued an Order for Continued Hospitalization\r\n  and for Hearing to be held on June 21, 2005.Â  That same day, Judge Lawson\r\n  appointed Dr. Bryant-Mobley and Doris Ann Burrell, a registered nurse, as\r\n  designated examiners.Â  On June 14, 2005, Appellant was notified of the hearing\r\n  and the name of her court-appointed counsel.[5]\r\nOn June 21, 2005, Judge\r\n  Lawson conducted a hearing at which the court-appointed examiners presented\r\n  their findings regarding Appellant's mental health.Â  Appellant and her attorney\r\n  were in attendance and participated in the hearing.Â  On that same day, Judge\r\n  Lawson issued an Order for Continued Treatment with mandatory outpatient\r\n  treatment to follow at the Orangeburg County Mental Health Facility for a\r\n  period not to exceed twelve months.[6]Â  \r\nOn July 8, 2005, Probate\r\n  Court Judge Jones-Glover issued an order appointing Dr. Cheryl Dodds, one of\r\n  Appellant's treating physicians at Three Rivers, to examine Appellant as to\r\n  whether she needed a guardian and/or a conservator. Â Although Dr. Dodds\r\n  believed Appellant to be an &quot;incapacitated person&quot; and in need of a\r\n  guardian/conservator, she could not definitively determine whether Appellant's\r\n  condition was temporary or permanent.\r\nOn July 20, 2005, Appellant\r\n  was discharged into the care of her son after receiving treatment at Three\r\n  Rivers and consenting to voluntarily taking her prescribed medication.Â  Dr.\r\n  Dodds's discharge diagnosis was &quot;bipolar disease, manic with\r\n  psychosis.&quot;Â  \r\nOn June 13, 2007, Appellant\r\n  filed suit against Husband and her son as well as the hospitals, physicians,\r\n  and nurses involved in the involuntary commitment proceedings.Â  Appellant\r\n  asserted causes of action against Respondent for intentional infliction of\r\n  emotional distress, false imprisonment, conspiracy, defamation, invasion of\r\n  privacy, and public disclosure of a private fact.Â  \r\nRespondent filed a motion for\r\n  summary judgment as to all causes of action with the exception of conspiracy.Â  In\r\n  support of its motion, Respondent initially claimed that it was not a proper\r\n  party to the lawsuit as the December 2006 Purchase Agreement required Three\r\n  Rivers to indemnify Respondent and hold harmless from any and all liabilities\r\n  occurring before January 1, 2007.Â  Additionally, Respondent claimed that the\r\n  doctrine of res judicata precluded Appellant from challenging the\r\n  validity of the June 6, 2005 commitment order as Appellant failed to appeal\r\n  this order.Â  Accordingly, Respondent asserted it was justified in relying on\r\n  the probate court order.Â  \r\nAs to Appellant's specific\r\n  causes of action, Respondent asserted that it was entitled to summary judgment with\r\n  respect to false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress\r\n  because the actions of Three Rivers were based upon the execution of a valid\r\n  involuntary commitment order of the probate court.Â  In terms of Appellant's\r\n  claims of defamation and invasion of privacy/public disclosure of a private fact,\r\n  Respondent contended that any disclosure of Appellant's psychiatric information\r\n  was authorized and done in accordance with the judicially-mandated involuntary\r\n  commitment order and proceedings.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing, Circuit\r\n  Court Judge R. Knox McMahon granted summary judgment to Respondent as to\r\n  Appellant's claims for false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional\r\n  distress, and defamation.[7]\r\nAppellant appealed Judge\r\n  McMahon's order to the Court of Appeals.Â  This Court certified this appeal\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nWhen reviewing an order granting summary\r\n  judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard as\r\n    the trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857,\r\n    860 (2002).Â  Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure provides that a trial court may grant a motion for summary\r\n  judgment &quot;if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.&quot; Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  &quot;Summary\r\n  judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is\r\n  desirable to clarify the application of the law.&quot; Â USAA Prop. &amp;\r\n    Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, 377 S.C. 643, 653, 661 S.E.2d 791, 796 (2008).Â  In\r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in\r\n  the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Fleming, 350 S.C. at\r\n  493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nB.\r\nAll of Appellant's arguments\r\n  emanate from the following two theories:Â  (1) the Order of Continued\r\n  Hospitalization (June 13, 1005) and the Order for Continued Treatment (June 21,\r\n  2005) were invalid as they were based on the void initial Order of Detention\r\n  (June 6, 2005); and (2) there was no factual basis to substantiate the findings\r\n  underlying the Order for Continued Treatment (June 21, 2005).Â  Without a &quot;lawful&quot;\r\n  probate court order, Appellant claims Respondent was not justified in detaining\r\n  her, no privilege attached to Respondent's communications about Appellant, and\r\n  it was not reasonable for Respondent to detain her.\r\nAs\r\n  will be discussed, we find that Appellant is procedurally barred from\r\n  challenging the validity of the underlying orders.Â  Based on the valid orders,\r\n  we conclude that the circuit court judge correctly granted summary judgment in\r\n  favor of Respondent.\r\nC.\r\nWe find Appellant's challenge\r\n  to the validity of the underlying commitment orders was not only untimely but\r\n  also barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\r\nOn March 25, 2008, Appellant\r\n  filed a Petition to Vacate Commitment Proceedings. Â In this Petition, Appellant\r\n  contended the June 6, 2005 Order of Detention was rendered &quot;invalid&quot;\r\n  after she was discharged on June 7, 2005 from TRMC of Orangeburg.Â  Because the\r\n  parties could not &quot;re-use&quot; the June 6, 2005 Order of Detention to\r\n  transport her to Aurora on June 8, 2005, Appellant asserted that the probate court\r\n  lacked jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of the proceedings.Â  \r\nBy order dated August 25,\r\n  2008, Probate Court Judge Tiffany Provence denied Appellant's Petition. Â Judge\r\n  Provence rejected Appellant's contention that the parties &quot;re-used&quot;\r\n  the June 6, 2005 Order of Detention.Â  Instead, she found that Dr. Hooker's\r\n  Certificate of Licensed Physician Examination for Emergency Admission\r\n  &quot;trigger[ed] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-17-440, which grants state or local law\r\n  enforcement three days from the date of said certification to transport the\r\n  person to the hospital designated by the certificate.&quot;Â  Referencing the\r\n  applicable code provisions, Judge Provence found that &quot;no procedural error\r\n  existed under the S.C. Probate Code.&quot; \r\nAppellant appealed Judge\r\n  Provence's order to the circuit court.Â  By order dated August 18, 2009, Judge\r\n  Diane S. Goodstein affirmed Judge Provence's order in its entirety.Â  \r\nAs outlined above,\r\n  Appellant's challenge to the commitment proceedings was clearly beyond the\r\n  statutorily-mandated, fifteen-day time period.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-17-620 (2002) (&quot;The petitioner or the person\r\n  shall have the right to appeal from any order of the probate court issued\r\n  pursuant to Section 44-17-580 to the court of common pleas of the county where\r\n  the probate court is situated. Â The notice of intention to appeal together with\r\n  the grounds for the appeal shall be filed in the probate court and the court of\r\n  common pleas within fifteen days of the date of the order issued pursuant to\r\n  Section 44-17-580.&quot;); Mims v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 440 S.E.2d 357\r\n  (1994) (holding that fifteen-day limit provided under section 44-17-620 sets\r\n  forth the procedure to appeal any order of involuntary commitment from the\r\n  probate court).Â  Accordingly, we find Appellant was precluded from collaterally\r\n  attacking the underlying commitment orders.Â  See In re Webber,\r\n  689 S.E.2d 468 (N.C. Ct. App. 2009) (recognizing that failure to timely appeal\r\n  involuntary civil commitment order precluded collateral attack on alleged\r\n  erroneous underlying order), cert. denied, 699 S.E.2d 925 (N.C. 2010).\r\nFurthermore, there is no\r\n  evidence that Appellant appealed Judge Goodstein's order.Â  Because Judge\r\n  Goodstein's order constitutes a final adjudication regarding the validity of\r\n  the commitment proceedings, the doctrine of res judicata precludes\r\n  Appellant from asserting any challenge to the commitment orders.[8]Â  See Riedman Corp. v. Greenville Steel\r\n    Structures, Inc., 308 S.C. 467, 419 S.E.2d\r\n  217 (1992) (recognizing that in order to bar subsequent lawsuit based on res\r\n    judicata, the following elements must be proven:Â  (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject\r\n  matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit).[9]\r\nAdditionally, we disagree\r\n  with Appellant's assertion that her involuntary commitment was without a factual\r\n  basis.Â  In support of this assertion Appellant directs this Court's attention\r\n  to numerous documents, including Dr. Leonhardt's consulting opinion dated June\r\n  14, 2005, which was requested by Dr. Bryant-Mobley and reviewed by Dr. Dodds.Â \r\n  It was indicated in the opinion that Appellant's condition was the result of\r\n  &quot;marital conflict&quot; as she was an &quot;alleged victim of abuse.&quot; \r\nInitially, we would note that\r\n  Judge Lawson presumably took into consideration Dr. Leonhardt's opinion as the court-appointed\r\n  examiners presented their findings to Judge Lawson during the June 21, 2005\r\n  hearing.Â  Furthermore, the remaining documents offered by Appellant are\r\n  depositions and affidavits that post-date the involuntary commitment\r\n  proceedings.Â  These after-the-fact documents cannot operate to retroactively\r\n  invalidate the commitment orders that were procedurally proper and factually\r\n  substantiated by court-appointed medical personnel.Â  To find otherwise, we would\r\n  undermine the probate court's authority in involuntary commitment proceedings.\r\nD. \r\nHaving found that the\r\n  underlying commitment orders were valid, the question becomes whether Judge\r\n  McMahon correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Respondent as to Appellant's\r\n  claims of false imprisonment, defamation, and intentional infliction of\r\n  emotional distress.\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp; False Imprisonment\r\nIn granting summary judgment\r\n  to Respondent, Judge McMahon found that Appellant's claim of false imprisonment\r\n  could not be maintained because Respondent took Appellant into custody and\r\n  detained her pursuant to a lawful order of the probate court.\r\nÂ &quot;False imprisonment is\r\n  the deprivation of one's liberty without justification.&quot;Â  Jones by\r\n    Robinson v. Winn Dixie Greenville, Inc., 318 S.C. 171, 175, 456 S.E.2d 429,\r\n  432 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  &quot;In order to recover under a theory of false\r\n  imprisonment, the complainant must establish (1) the defendant restrained him;\r\n  (2) the restraint was intentional; and (3) the restraint was unlawful.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n&quot;If a hospital fails to\r\n  follow the statutory requirements for the commitment of a person to a hospital\r\n  or mental facility, it may be liable for false imprisonment.&quot;Â  18 S.C.\r\n  Jur. Hospitals Â§ 21 (2011).Â  &quot;If these statutory guidelines are not\r\n  followed, the hospital may face liability for false imprisonment because any\r\n  detainment would be unlawful.&quot; Â Id.Â  \r\nAs previously discussed,\r\n  Appellant was lawfully taken into custody and detained pursuant to valid\r\n  probate court orders.Â  It is generally accepted that:Â  \r\n\r\n  A person\r\n    confined pursuant to an authorized mental health commitment proceeding or\r\n    process may not recover damages in a false imprisonment action.Â  In accordance\r\n    with the general rule dealing with confinement under process, even where the\r\n    order of commitment is erroneously made, but is valid on its face and issued by\r\n    a court of competent jurisdiction, the detention is not false imprisonment.\r\n  State\r\n    hospital officials have no duty to examine the form of the report of the\r\n    examining psychiatrists upon which an order of commitment was based, nor is\r\n    there any duty to examine or investigate a commitment order valid on its face,\r\n    unless there is knowledge that there was, in fact, no basis for implementing\r\n    the order.\r\n\r\n32 Am. Jur. 2d False\r\n  Imprisonment Â§ 33 (2007).\r\nAccordingly, Appellant cannot\r\n  maintain a claim of false imprisonment against Respondent.Â  See Manley\r\n    v. Manley, 291 S.C. 325, 353 S.E.2d 312 (Ct. App. 1987) (concluding\r\n  involuntary commitment of mother, who claimed she was not mentally ill, was\r\n  pursuant to a lawful order of the probate judge and, thus, was not a basis for\r\n  recovery on a claim of false imprisonment against former husband, two adult children,\r\n  and psychiatrist). \r\n2. Defamation\r\nIn granting summary judgment to\r\n  Respondent, Judge McMahon found the treatment provided by Three Rivers: (1) was\r\n  confined to that ordered by the probate court; (2) was not disclosed to any\r\n  party other than was ordered; and (3) any reports issued by Three Rivers were\r\n  qualifiedly privileged and, thus, could not be defamatory.Â  Additionally, Judge\r\n  McMahon found that statutory exceptions allowed the disclosure of privileged\r\n  psychiatric information in involuntary commitment proceedings. \r\n&quot;The tort of defamation\r\n  allows a plaintiff to recover for injury to his or her reputation as the result\r\n  of the defendant's communications to others of a false message about the\r\n  plaintiff.&quot;Â  Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C.\r\n  444, 464, 629 S.E.2d 653, 664 (2006) (citing Holtzscheiter v. Thomson\r\n    Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 508, 506 S.E.2d 497, 501 (1998)).\r\n&quot;In order to prove\r\n  defamation, the plaintiff must show (1) a false and defamatory statement was\r\n  made; (2) the unprivileged publication was made to a third party; (3) the\r\n  publisher was at fault; and (4) either actionability of the statement\r\n  irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The publication of a statement is defamatory if it tends to\r\n  harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the\r\n  community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with\r\n  him.&quot;Â  Fleming, 350 S.C. at 494, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nWe find that summary judgment\r\n  was properly granted to Respondent as any communications issued by Three\r\n  Rivers' employees were qualifiedly privileged as they were done in effectuating\r\n  the lawful orders of the probate court.Â  See Manley, 291 S.C. at\r\n  330-32, 353 S.E.2d at 315 (concluding mother, who was involuntarily committed,\r\n  could not maintain action for defamation against former husband, two adult children,\r\n  and psychiatrist where assertions made in connection with the involuntary\r\n  commitment were qualifiedly privileged as they did not exceed their proper\r\n  scope).\r\nFurthermore, sections\r\n  44-22-90 and 44-22-100 of the South Carolina Code authorized Three Rivers'\r\n  employees to disclose Appellant's mental health records within the confines of\r\n  the involuntary commitment proceedings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-22-90(A)(2),\r\n  (4) (2002) (providing exceptions to the disclosure of privileged mental health\r\n  records, including in involuntary commitment proceedings and information\r\n  related through the course of a court-ordered psychiatric examination); id. Â§ 44-22-100(A)(2), (4), (5) (permitting disclosure of confidential mental\r\n  health records where disclosure is necessary: Â for the conduct of proceedings\r\n  before a court and that failure to make the disclosure is contrary to the\r\n  public interest; to cooperate with law enforcement, health, welfare, and other\r\n  agencies or to further the welfare of a patient; and to carry out the statutory\r\n  provisions for involuntary commitment proceedings).\r\n3. Intentional Infliction of\r\n  Emotional Distress\r\nIn granting summary judgment\r\n  in favor of Respondent, Judge McMahon found that the actions of Three Rivers\r\n  could not be regarded as so extreme and outrageous to allow Appellant to\r\n  recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress because Three Rivers\r\n  did not participate in procuring the initial commitment order and the treatment\r\n  of Appellant was conducted in a reasonable manner.Â  Additionally, Judge McMahon\r\n  held that Three Rivers was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity as it was\r\n  treating Appellant pursuant to the involuntary commitment order. Â \r\nIn order to\r\n  recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must\r\n  establish the following:\r\n\r\n  (1)Â  the defendant intentionally or\r\n    recklessly inflicted severe Â Â Â emotional distress, or was certain, or\r\n    substantially certain, that such distress would result from his conduct;\r\n  (2)Â  the conduct was so &quot;extreme and outrageous&quot; so as to\r\n    exceed Â Â &quot;all possible bounds of decency&quot; and must be regarded as\r\n    &quot;atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community;&quot;\r\n  (3)Â  the actions of the defendant caused plaintiff's emotional\r\n    distress; and\r\n  (4)Â  the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was\r\n    &quot;severe&quot; such that &quot;no reasonable man could be expected to\r\n    endure it.&quot;\r\n\r\nHansson v. Scalise Builders of S.C., 374 S.C. 352, 356, 650 S.E.2d 68, 70\r\n  (2007).\r\nWe hold that Appellant could not, as a matter of law, maintain a\r\n  claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Respondent as\r\n  Respondent's conduct towards Appellant was reasonable and in accordance with\r\n  the valid probate court orders.Â  See Manley, 291 S.C. at 329-30, 353 S.E.2d at 314 (concluding mother,\r\n  who was involuntarily committed to psychiatric facility, could not maintain\r\n  cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against former\r\n  husband, two adult children, and psychiatrist, where defendants &quot;acted in\r\n  good faith and in a reasonable manner&quot; regarding the involuntary\r\n  commitment proceedings).\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBecause Appellant failed to\r\n  timely and properly challenge the probate court's orders, they are presumed\r\n  valid.Â  Based on these valid orders, we find that Respondent's conduct toward\r\n  Appellant was lawful, justified, and reasonable.Â  Thus, Appellant cannot\r\n  maintain causes of action for false imprisonment, defamation, or intentional\r\n  infliction of emotional distress against Respondent.Â  Accordingly, we affirm\r\n  the decision of the circuit court granting summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Respondent.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â On December 15, 2006, Respondent's wholly-owned\r\n  subsidiary, Premier Behavioral Solutions, Inc., entered into a stock sale\r\n  purchase of Three Rivers Healthcare Group, L.L.C., Three Rivers SPE Holding,\r\n  L.L.C., and Three Rivers SPE Manager, Inc., L.L.C.Â  \r\n[2]Â  S.C.

Rauch Wise, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:Â \r\n  In this appeal from the family court, we are asked to determine whether an\r\n  agreement between the parties for the provision of health insurance is a\r\n  modifiable form of support.Â  We hold that unless the agreement provides\r\n  otherwise, the obligation to maintain health insurance is an incident of\r\n  support.Â  Because there is no language in this agreement limiting the court's\r\n  power to modify it, we find a modification is warranted based on a substantial\r\n  change in circumstances.Â  We remand this case to the family court for a\r\n  determination of what form this modification is to take and whether the party\r\n  receiving the modification is entitled to reimbursement for excess support paid\r\n  during the pendency of this appeal.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn March 2000, Theodora Miles\r\n  (&quot;Wife&quot;) petitioned for a divorce from James Richard Miles\r\n  (&quot;Husband&quot;) on the ground of adultery and sought custody of the\r\n  couples' two minor children, child support, equitable division of the marital\r\n  assets, alimony, and attorney's fees.Â  Prior to the final hearing, the parties\r\n  reached an agreement as to many of the issues, which provided in pertinent\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n  5.[Husband]\r\n    shall continue to maintain health and dental insurance on [Wife] through his\r\n    place of employment until such time as [Wife] remarries or until [Wife] attains\r\n    employment which provides health insurance to employees as part of its fringe\r\n    benefits package; both [Husband] and [Wife] waive alimony.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  remainder of the agreement divided the parties' property, determined custody\r\n  and visitation of their children, established child support, and awarded\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  The family court approved the agreement, and by order dated August\r\n  16, 2000, granted Wife a divorce and incorporated the parties' agreement.Â  The\r\n  following language is contained in the order:\r\n\r\n  5.Â  [Husband] is hereby\r\n    ordered to cover [Wife] through his place of employment with health and dental\r\n    insurance until such time a[s Wife] remarries or obtains employment which\r\n    provides such coverage to [Wife] as a fringe benefit.\r\n  6.Â  Alimony is denied to each\r\n    party.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  agreement contained no language limiting or otherwise restricting modification\r\n  of its terms.\r\nSix\r\n  years later, Husband filed this action seeking to modify various aspects of the\r\n  final order.Â  Specifically, he sought a reduction in his child support\r\n  obligation, attorney's fees, and the termination of the requirement that he\r\n  maintain health and dental insurance on Wife due to a substantial change in\r\n  circumstances.[1]Â \r\n  The parties did agree to a reduction in Husband's child support obligations,\r\n  but the remaining issues were left for the court to decide.[2]Â \r\n  At the time of the proposed modification, Wife did not have insurance coverage\r\n  through her employer and had not re-married, both of which would terminate Husband's\r\n  obligation by the terms of the agreement and the court's order.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  issue before the court was whether the agreement to provide health insurance was\r\n  a modifiable support obligation or a non-modifiable agreement similar to a\r\n  property division.\r\nThe\r\n  family court found the fact that Wife waived alimony in the agreement\r\n  &quot;unambiguously shows the intent of the parties that the health insurance\r\n  maintenance provision was not in the form of support.&quot;Â  Further, the court\r\n  held &quot;the language of the parties' agreement is plain, unambiguous, and I\r\n  therefore decline to construe that the maintenance [of] the health insurance\r\n  pursuant to this agreement is actually support.Â  The parties further clarified\r\n  their intent when they inserted the sentence that both parties waive\r\n  alimony.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the court denied Husband the modification he\r\n  sought.Â  The court of appeals affirmed, agreeing the agreement unambiguously\r\n  did not create a support obligation. Miles v. Miles, Op. No. 2009-UP-007\r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 7, 2009).Â  We granted certiorari.\r\nISSUE PRESENTED\r\nDid\r\n  the court of appeals err in affirming the family court's conclusion that the\r\n  parties' agreement unambiguously did not create a support obligation and therefore\r\n  Husband's obligation to maintain health insurance is non-modifiable?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  an appeal from a decision of the family court, this Court may find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Rutherford\r\n    v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  Thus, our\r\n  review of a family court's order on whether to modify support awards is de\r\n    novo.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether Agreement Is\r\n  Modifiable\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the court of appeals erred in affirming the determination his obligation\r\n  to provide insurance benefits to Wife was unambiguously not a form of support.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nWe\r\n  encourage litigants in family court to reach extrajudicial agreements on\r\n  marital issues.Â  The interpretation of such agreements is a matter of contract\r\n  law. Hardee, 348 S.C. at 91-92, 558 S.E.2d at 267.Â  Where an agreement\r\n  is clear on its face and unambiguous, &quot;the court's only function is to\r\n  interpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties as found within the\r\n  agreement.&quot; Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289, 295, 543 S.E.2d\r\n  271, 274 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, if the agreement is ambiguous, it is the\r\n  court's duty to determine the intent of the parties. Id.Â  It may do so\r\n  by examining extrinsic evidence. McKinney v. McKinney, 274 S.C. 95, 97,\r\n  261 S.E.2d 526, 527 (1980).Â  An agreement is ambiguous if it is susceptible to\r\n  more than one interpretation or its meaning is unclear. Smith-Cooper,\r\n  344 S.C. at 295, 543 S.E.2d at 274.Â  The\r\n  interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law. S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d\r\n  299, 303 (2001).Â  Similarly, whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of\r\n  law. Id. at 617, 550 S.E.2d at 302-303.Â  If the court finds it necessary\r\n  to examine extrinsic evidence to discern the intent of the parties, the\r\n  determination of intent is a question of fact. Id. at 617, 550 S.E.2d at\r\n  303.[3]\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note that because the agreement is silent as to the family court's power to\r\n  modify it, it remained modifiable by the court. See Moseley v. Mosier,\r\n  279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983) (&quot;[U]nless the agreement\r\n  unambiguously denies the court jurisdiction, the terms will be modifiable by\r\n  the court . . . .&quot;).Â  As to whether Husband's obligation is an incident of\r\n  support, the maintenance of health insurance has the hallmark of spousal\r\n  support: it provides the receiving spouse a benefit which is normally incident\r\n  to the marital relationship. See Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292, 617\r\n  S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005).Â  Additionally, our courts have previously awarded\r\n  health insurance as a form of support. Sharpe v. Sharpe, 307 S.C. 540,\r\n  542, 416 S.E.2d 215, 216 (Ct. App. 1992); Wood v. Wood, 292 S.C. 43,\r\n  48-49, 354 S.E.2d 796, 799-800 (Ct. App. 1987).[4]Â \r\n  Awards of spousal support do not become property divisions, and therefore\r\n  non-modifiable, absent something more. See Mattox v. Cassidy, 289 S.C.\r\n  57, 62, 344 S.E.2d 620, 623 (Ct. App. 1986) (&quot;To show that the alimony\r\n  award was part of a property settlement agreement, it must be shown that the\r\n  wife surrendered property rights in return for the husband's agreement to pay\r\n  the stated sums.&quot;).\r\nHere,\r\n  the agreement simply states Husband will provide health and dental insurance\r\n  for Wife.Â  It does not indicate Wife surrendered property rights in exchange\r\n  for it, nor does the agreement provide any indication that Husband's obligation\r\n  is anything other than support.Â  Additionally, this requirement\r\n  terminates automatically upon Wife's remarriage or her obtaining employment\r\n  that provides similar coverage, both instances in which she would be able to\r\n  obtain this benefit through means other than Husband. Â Â The language creating\r\n  Husband's obligation in the agreement even appears in the same paragraph as the\r\n  language pertaining to alimony.Â  In fact, it is in the same sentence.Â  Looking\r\n  squarely at the face of the agreement, we cannot find it is unclear or\r\n  susceptible to more than one interpretation.Â  Therefore, although we agree with\r\n  the family court and the court of appeals that the agreement is unambiguous, we\r\n  hold that it unambiguously creates a support obligation. See In re Marriage\r\n    of Johnson, 781 N.W.2d 553, 557 (Iowa 2010) (&quot;[W]e conclude as a\r\n  matter of law that a provision in a dissolution decree requiring one spouse to\r\n  provide medical support in the form of health insurance payments to the other\r\n  spouse is modifiable spousal support . . . .&quot;).Â  \r\nWife argues that her decision\r\n  to waive alimony unambiguously demonstrates the insurance obligation is not an\r\n  incident of support.Â  However, alimony is not the only form of support\r\n  available in a divorce. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (Supp. 2009)\r\n  (discussing the different forms of alimony and &quot;[s]uch other form of\r\n  spousal support . . . as appropriate under the circumstances&quot;); Whitfield\r\n    v. Hanks, 278 S.C. 165, 165, 293 S.E.2d 314, 315 (1982) (holding an award\r\n  of possession of the marital home is an incident of support).Â  Wife and the\r\n  family court have placed too much emphasis on the language that the parties\r\n  &quot;waive[d] alimony.&quot;Â  Such semantic distinctions have been abolished\r\n  in family law. Moseley, 279 S.C. at 352-53, 306 S.E.2d at 627.Â  As we said\r\n  in Moseley, \r\n\r\n  [t]he parties' intent is rarely revealed from the agreement's\r\n    words of art. Â Generally, those terms are used without intending or implying\r\n    any particular legal consequences. Â Later, courts impose the consequences upon\r\n    the unsuspecting parties. Â Today, we overrule those cases which hold that words\r\n    of art make a major distinction in the operation of divorce law.\r\n\r\nId.Â  The mere fact the parties waived\r\n  alimonyâ€”i.e., permanent and periodic, lump sum, rehabilitative, and\r\n  reimbursement alimonyâ€”does not lead to the inescapable conclusion they\r\n  accordingly waived all other forms of support.Â  Such a result is contrary to\r\n  the common sense approach to extrajudicial agreements advocated in Moseley.Â  \r\nTherefore, we\r\n  hold the agreement unambiguously provides a modifiable incident of support in\r\n  the form of health and dental insurance as a matter of law.Â  Thus, the family\r\n  court committed an error of law in denying Husband a modification.[5]\r\nII.&nbsp; Substantial\r\n  Change In Circumstances\r\nNext, it must be\r\n  determined whether Husband has presented a substantial change in circumstances\r\n  that would entitle him to a modification of his support obligation.Â  A party is\r\n  entitled to such a modification if he can show an unanticipated substantial\r\n  change in circumstances. Butler v. Butler, 385 S.C. 328, 336, 684 S.E.2d\r\n  191, 195 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;The party seeking modification bears the\r\n  burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the unforeseen change\r\n  has occurred.&quot; Id. (quotations omitted).Â  This burden is always a\r\n  high one, hence the requirement that the change in circumstances be\r\n  &quot;substantial.&quot;Â  Prior case law has indicated that a party faces a\r\n  heightened burden when seeking to prove a substantial change in circumstances\r\n  from a court order approving an agreement. See Floyd v. Morgan, 383 S.C.\r\n  469, 475, 681 S.E.2d 570, 573 (2009) (holding there is an increased burden to\r\n  modify a child support obligation based on substantial change in circumstances\r\n  where an agreement is involved); Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 26,\r\n  624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006) (&quot;The party seeking modification has the burden\r\n  to show changed circumstances.Â  This burden is increased where the child\r\n  support award is based on a settlement agreement.&quot;); Townsend v.\r\n    Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73-74, 587 S.E.2d 118, 120 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n  (&quot;Where the amount of child support is based on a settlement agreement,\r\n  the party requesting modification has an even heavier burden.&quot;).Â  This\r\n  principle has had the effect of chilling the litigants' desire to resolve their\r\n  disputes by agreement, which is contrary to this Court's longstanding\r\n  preference in favor of settlement. Â Accordingly, we take this opportunity to\r\n  expressly disavow the line of cases that articulate an even higher burden on\r\n  the party seeking modification when an agreement is involved.Â  Today, we clarify\r\n  that while the burden to prove entitlement to a modification of spousal or\r\n  child support is a substantial one, the same burden applies whether the family\r\n  court order in question emanated from an order following a contested hearing or\r\n  a hearing to approve an agreement.\r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, the family court took evidence regarding changes in circumstances in the\r\n  event the judge found Husband's obligation to be an incident of support.Â \r\n  Because he concluded otherwise, he did not reach the issue of Husband's change\r\n  in circumstances in his order.Â  However, the parties had a full opportunity to\r\n  develop the record and present evidence on this issue.Â  Therefore, in keeping\r\n  with our standard of review in equity matters, we will take our own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence presented to the family court. See Rutherford,\r\n  307 S.C. at 204, 414 S.E.2d at 160.Â  It is undisputed that the following events\r\n  have occurred in Husband's life since the entry of the final decree in 2000: he\r\n  underwent a triple bypass, tore his rotator cuff, and was diagnosed with colon\r\n  cancer, all of which required seven operations; as a result of his medical\r\n  conditions, he is no longer employed and is totally disabled; the income he\r\n  receives on disability of $1,830 gross per month is less than half of his\r\n  former earnings as a police officer; and the insurance premiums he pays\r\n  pursuant to his child support obligations have increased.[6] Â Wife does not allege any of these\r\n  events could have been anticipated at the time of their agreement.Â  Husband\r\n  further testified the insurance premiums he pays for Wife are approximately\r\n  $370 per month.Â  As for Wife during this time period, her income has increased\r\n  from $28,000 per year at the time of the divorce to $45,000 per year.[7]\r\nBased on the\r\n  evidence before us, we find that Husband has demonstrated a substantial change\r\n  in circumstances that merits a modification in his support obligation to\r\n  provide health and dental insurance coverage for Wife.Â  While Husband's earning\r\n  capacity and health have significantly deteriorated since the time of his divorce\r\n  from Wife, Wife finds herself in improved economic conditions. Â See Miles v.\r\n    Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 519, 586 S.E.2d 136, 140 (Ct. App. 2003) (&quot;Many\r\n  of the same considerations relevant to the initial setting of an alimony award\r\n  may be applied in the modification context as well, including . . . each\r\n  party's earning capacity[] and the supporting spouse's ability to continue to\r\n  support the other spouse.&quot;).Â  However, the record is not complete enough\r\n  for us to determine the precise extent and mechanics of the modification and\r\n  whether Husband is entitled to reimbursement for the excess support he paid\r\n  between the time the family court denied Husband's modification and the entry\r\n  of final judgment following this appeal.Â  Accordingly, a remand is in order.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the\r\n  decision of the court of appeals and remand this matter to the family court for\r\n  proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and\r\n  dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  We granted\r\n  certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision which upheld the family\r\n  courtâ€™s finding that the insurance requirement here was not a modifiable form\r\n  of support. I agree with the majority that this finding is an error of law, one\r\n  which we should reverse.Â  I dissent, however, from that portion of the majority\r\n  opinion which undertakes to review the record and to make the factual\r\n  determination that petitioner demonstrated a substantial change of\r\n  circumstances.Â  In my opinion, this factual determination is beyond our\r\n  authority on certiorari.Â  See Lewis v. Lewis, Op. No. 26973Â \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011)(Pleicones, J., dissenting).\r\nI concur in the decision to\r\n  remand the matter to the family court, but would leave the issues of changed\r\n  circumstances and further relief to that tribunal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] To demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances,\r\n  Husband established he underwent a triple bypass, tore his rotator cuff, and was\r\n  diagnosed with colon cancer, all of which resulted in a total of seven\r\n  surgeries; is no longer employed and is totally disabled; his income has been\r\n  halved; and his own and his children's health insurance premiums have\r\n  increased.\r\n[2] The issue of attorney's fees is not before the Court.\r\n[3] Although the family court here undertook to receive\r\n  evidence on intent, it ultimately determined that the agreement was\r\n  unambiguous.\r\n[4] Wife argues Sharpe and Wood are\r\n  distinguishable because the family court in both of those cases specifically\r\n  included the insurance award as alimony and there was no agreement between the\r\n  parties.Â  While Wife is correct factually, we do not agree these facts make\r\n  those cases inapplicable.Â  We believe they actually counter Wife's position:\r\n  they demonstrate the family court found health insurance to be a form of\r\n  support and nothing else.\r\n[5] Because we answer the\r\n  question before us as a matter of law, we need not reach the factual\r\n  determinations of the parties' intent based on the extrinsic evidence received\r\n  by the family court.\r\n[6] As a result of his rotator\r\n  cuff injury, he received a workers' compensation payment of $102,000.Â  It\r\n  appears from Husband's testimony much of this payment was used to pay his\r\n  associated medical bills, while a portion of it was used to make a donation to\r\n  his church and purchase his new wife a car.Â  Husband also argues his own health\r\n  insurance premiums have increased due to his ailments.Â  However, he testified\r\n  his former employer pays, and will continue to pay, his personal premiums. \r\n[7] We note that Wife also receives $632 per month from\r\n  Husband's retirement benefits.Â  However, because this was part of the equitable\r\n  division in the final decree, it is not a change in circumstances for us to\r\n  consider.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
