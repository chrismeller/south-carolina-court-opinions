Short, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25798\r\nSubmitted February 19, 2004 - Filed \r\n  April 5, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAndrew David Grimes, of Summerville, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Chief Capital &amp; Collateral Litigation Donald Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney \r\n  General Douglas E. Leadbitter, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:          Petitioner \r\n  filed this petition for a writ of certiorari pursuant to Austin v. State, \r\n  305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991), addressing the questions petitioner sought \r\n  to have reviewed from the order denying his 1987 PCR application.  We affirm \r\n  the denial of relief in part, but vacate one of petitionerâ€™s convictions because \r\n  we find that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept a \r\n  guilty plea to one of the second-degree burglary charges.  \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner pled guilty to four counts of second-degree \r\n  burglary in 1986.  He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, concurrent, on \r\n  each count.  No direct appeal was taken.  Petitioner filed a PCR application \r\n  in 1987.  That application was denied following a hearing, and petitioner did \r\n  not seek certiorari. [1]   \r\nIn 1997, petitioner filed a PCR application related \r\n  to other charges.  At that hearing, petitioner sought to amend his application \r\n  to include an allegation that the circuit court did not have subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to accept his 1986 guilty pleas.  The PCR judge ordered that the \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction issue be addressed in a separate PCR application.  \r\n\r\nIn March 2001, a hearing was held in the circuit \r\n  court on the subject matter jurisdiction issue and petitionerâ€™s Austin \r\n  claim.  The PCR judge denied relief as to the subject matter jurisdiction claim.  \r\n  As to petitionerâ€™s Austin claim, the PCR judge found petitioner knowingly \r\n  and voluntarily waived his right to appellate review of the denial of his first \r\n  PCR application.  \r\nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \r\n  and this Court found there was no evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding \r\n  that petitioner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to seek appellate \r\n  review of the denial of his 1987 PCR application.  Accordingly, the Court ordered \r\n  petitioner to serve and file a petition, pursuant to Austin, addressing \r\n  the questions petitioner sought to have reviewed from the order denying his \r\n  1987 PCR application.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.       Did \r\n  the circuit court have jurisdiction to accept petitionerâ€™s pleas to second-degree \r\n  burglary?                   \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWould petitionerâ€™s due process rights be violated if the Court fails to remand \r\n  the matter to the circuit court to have the 1987 PCR hearing record reconstructed?\r\n\r\n1.          SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\r\nPetitioner claims the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  over three of his second-degree burglary indictments because the indictments \r\n  allege petitioner broke into a â€œdwellingâ€ instead of a â€œbuilding.â€  We disagree.                     \r\n\r\nThree of petitionerâ€™s four indictments specifically allege that: (1) \r\n  petitioner was charged with second-degree burglary; (2) petitioner entered without \r\n  consent; (3) petitioner entered with the intent to commit a crime therein; and, \r\n  (4) petitioner entered during the nighttime.  However, the indictments each \r\n  allege, respectively, that petitioner entered the â€œdwelling of Cudd-Lovelace \r\n  Insurance Company,â€ the â€œdwelling of Bill Willard,â€ and the â€œdwelling of P&amp;G \r\n  Motors.â€  The only evidence presented at the plea hearing was that the â€œdwellingsâ€ \r\n  were actually businesses, including evidence that the â€œdwelling of Bill Willardâ€ \r\n  was actually an office adjacent to P&amp;G Motors.  None of the indictments \r\n  specify whether petitioner was indicted under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(A) \r\n  or (B) (2003).  \r\nSection 16-11-312(A) states that a person is guilty of burglary in the \r\n  second degree if that person enters a dwelling without consent and with the \r\n  intent to commit a crime therein.  Section 16-11-312(B) states that a person \r\n  is guilty of burglary in the second degree if that person enters a building \r\n  without consent and with the intent to commit a crime therein, and one or more \r\n  aggravating factors is present.  One of the aggravating factors is that the \r\n  burglary occurred in the nighttime. \r\n  [2]   \r\nPetitioner argues the second-degree burglary indictments for the dwellings of \r\n  Cudd-Lovelace, P&amp;G Motors, and Bill Willard do not allege the essential \r\n  elements of second-degree burglary under Â§16-11-312(A) because the indictments \r\n  allege petitioner entered â€œdwellingsâ€ at night rather than during the day.  \r\n  Petitioner also contends the indictments do not allege the essential elements \r\n  of second-degree burglary under Â§ 16-11-312(B) because the indictments fail \r\n  to allege that petitioner entered a building, and that a dwelling is not necessarily \r\n  a building.\r\nInitially, it must be noted that petitioner argued \r\n  at the 2001 PCR hearing that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  over the 1986 second-degree burglary indictments.  In his order denying relief \r\n  on the subject matter jurisdiction issue, the PCR judge took judicial notice \r\n  of an unpublished Court of Appeals decision involving petitionerâ€™s direct appeal \r\n  of a separate conviction.  In that case, petitioner was appealing his 1997 convictions \r\n  for second-degree burglary and grand larceny, for which he was sentenced to \r\n  life without parole (LWOP) because the 1986 second-degree burglary convictions \r\n  were serious offenses. [3]   The Court of Appeals rejected petitionerâ€™s \r\n  argument that the indictments could not be used as predicate offenses under \r\n  the recidivist statute because the indictments alleged petitioner entered a \r\n  â€œdwellingâ€ instead of a â€œbuilding.â€  State v. Koon, Op. No. 2000-UP-291 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 18, 2000).  The Court of Appeals found that three \r\n  of the four 1986 indictments were correctly used as predicate offenses to sentence \r\n  petitioner to LWOP as a recidivist because the indictments were sufficient to \r\n  identify which subsection of the second-degree burglary statute petitioner pled \r\n  guilty to.  This Court denied the subsequent petition for a writ of certiorari \r\n  to the Court of Appeals.  Accordingly, the PCR judge denied petitionerâ€™s subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction allegation because the Court of Appeals and this Court had \r\n  already rejected the claim.  \r\nBecause petitioner previously litigated and lost this argument before \r\n  the Court of Appeals and on certiorari to this Court, petitioner should be precluded \r\n  from making the same argument in his Austin brief.  Jinks v. Richland \r\n  County, 355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003) (collateral estoppel prevents \r\n  a party from relitigating in a subsequent suit an issue actually and necessarily \r\n  litigated and determined in a prior action); Doe v. State, 294 S.C. 125, \r\n  363 S.E.2d 106 (1987).  However, because the precise issue litigated did not \r\n  involve subject matter jurisdiction, and because the State failed to raise collateral \r\n  estoppel as an affirmative defense in its brief, we have addressed the issue \r\n  on the merits.          \r\nA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction if: (1) there has been \r\n  an indictment that sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been a waiver \r\n  of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged \r\n  in the indictment.  Locke v. State, 341 S.C. 54, 56, 533 S.E.2d 324, \r\n  325 (2000); State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 424 \r\n  (1999).  An indictment is sufficient to convey jurisdiction if it apprises the \r\n  defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged and informs \r\n  the defendant of the circumstances he must be prepared to defend.  Granger \r\n  v. State, 333 S.C. 2, 4, 507 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1998) (citing State v. \r\n  Evans, 322 S.C. 78, 470 S.E.2d 97 (1996)).  An indictment phrased substantially \r\n  in the language of the statute that creates and defines the offense is ordinarily \r\n  sufficient.  State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 88, 275 S.E.2d 878, 879 \r\n  (1981).   Subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including for \r\n  the first time on appeal.  Weinhauer v. State, 334 S.C. 327, 330, 513 \r\n  S.E.2d 840, 841 (1999); Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d \r\n  358, 359 (1995).  \r\nWe find that the three indictments petitioner questions sufficiently \r\n  set forth the elements of second-degree burglary under Â§ 16-11-312(B), despite \r\n  the fact that the indictments initially refer to the â€œbuildingsâ€ as â€œdwellings.â€  \r\n  The indictments specify which structure petitioner was charged with entering, \r\n  that petitioner entered each structure without consent, that petitioner intended \r\n  to commit a crime therein, and that petitioner entered in the nighttime, which \r\n  is one of the aggravating factors.  Further, it is clear from the record that \r\n  petitioner was charged with second-degree burglary for entering buildings, that \r\n  petitioner pled guilty to second-degree burglary for entering buildings, and \r\n  that petitioner did not plead guilty to second-degree burglary as a lesser-included \r\n  offense of first-degree burglary.  We hold the indictments sufficiently apprised \r\n  petitioner of the offense charged and the circumstances he should have been \r\n  prepared to defend.  Granger, id. at 4, 507 S.E.2d at 323.\r\nPetitioner also contends the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  in regard to the Stylette burglary indictment.  Petitioner argues the Stylette \r\n  indictment contains a fatal inconsistency because the indictment was issued \r\n  eight days before the crime was alleged to have occurred. [4]   Petitioner contends that, because \r\n  there is no evidence the incorrect date was a scrivenerâ€™s error, the Court should \r\n  vacate petitionerâ€™s second-degree burglary conviction for the Stylette burglary. \r\n\r\nIn State v. Lark, 64 S.C. 350, 42 S.E. 175 (1902), a murder indictment \r\n  showed on its face that it was found before the murder was committed.  In refusing \r\n  to arrest the judgment, the Court found that it would be absurd to charge a \r\n  crime before it was committed, and noted that the indictment indicated the murder \r\n  was a past offense, obviously committed before the finding of the indictment.  \r\n  Lark, id. at 352-53, 42 S.E. at 176. \r\nAs noted in Lark, it would have been absurd for the grand jury \r\n  to indict petitioner for an offense that had yet to be committed.  The Stylette \r\n  indictment, like the murder indictment in Lark, indicates the crime was \r\n  committed in the past.  \r\nHowever, though petitioner failed to raise this issue, the Stylette indictment \r\n  fails to allege any aggravating factor, such as whether the burglary occurred \r\n  at nighttime, as required by Â§ 16-11-312(B).  Further, all the evidence in the \r\n  record indicates Stylette was a business, not a dwelling.  Therefore, we hold \r\n  that the Stylette indictment fails to sufficiently allege the elements of second-degree \r\n  burglary pursuant to Â§ 16-11-312(A) or (B), and only alleges the elements of \r\n  third-degree burglary.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-313(A) (2003) (a person is guilty \r\n  of burglary in the third degree if the person enters a building without consent \r\n  and with the intent to commit a crime therein).  Accordingly, the circuit court \r\n  did not have jurisdiction to accept petitionerâ€™s guilty plea to second-degree \r\n  burglary on the Stylette indictment, and that conviction is vacated. \r\n  [5]        \r\n2.          RECONSTRUCTION HEARING\r\nPetitioner contends the Court must remand this matter to the circuit court to \r\n  have the record of his 1987 PCR hearing reconstructed because there is no transcript \r\n  of that proceeding.  \r\nWhere a transcript has been lost or destroyed, a court may remand to have the \r\n  record reconstructed.  See Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 574 \r\n  S.E.2d 200 (2002); China v. Parrott, 251 S.C. 329, 162 S.E.2d 276 (1968) \r\n  (trial judge reconstructed the record where court reporter records were unavailable).\r\nPetitioner contends he has non-frivolous issues that cannot be reviewed \r\n  absent a full development of the record.  Petitioner claims that, during the \r\n  1987 evidentiary hearing, the chief issue was whether his guilty pleas were \r\n  knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered, and that there is some indication \r\n  they were not so entered because petitioner was not advised of his right to \r\n  confront the witnesses against him.\r\nPetitioner also contends it is impossible to assess the merits of his \r\n  claim that the State withheld Brady \r\n  [6]  material without a transcript of the 1987 PCR hearing.  The alleged \r\n  Brady violation seems to involve â€œmud samplesâ€ that petitioner claims \r\n  police collected in connection with the investigation.  However, in his brief, \r\n  petitioner failed to allege any specifics regarding the allegation and failed \r\n  to state whether the PCR judge ruled on the issue in the 1987 order denying \r\n  relief. [7]    \r\nAt his 1986 plea, petitioner admitted that he committed all the burglaries.  \r\n  Petitioner admitted he entered P&amp;G Motors and Bill Willardâ€™s office, but \r\n  did not find anything to steal.  Petitioner also admitted he entered Cudd-Lovelace \r\n  through the side door.  However, later in the plea, petitioner claimed he was \r\n  innocent and had witnesses who would testify he was not at the scene of the \r\n  crime.  Petitioner also stated he was only agreeing to plead guilty because \r\n  he was facing a lot of prison time.  \r\nPetitioner further stated at the plea that no one had promised him anything \r\n  in exchange for his pleas, other than a ten-year sentence, and that no one had \r\n  threatened him or coerced him to plead guilty.  The plea judge informed petitioner \r\n  that he was entitled to a jury trial; that the State would have to prove him \r\n  guilty beyond a reasonable doubt if he went to trial; that petitioner did not \r\n  have to testify; that if petitioner chose not to testify, his decision would \r\n  not be held against him; and, that if petitioner had any witnesses who would \r\n  tend to prove him innocent, the State would be required to bring them to trial.  \r\n  Petitioner also stated that he was satisfied with counsel and that counsel had \r\n  done everything petitioner asked.  The plea judge ruled that petitionerâ€™s pleas \r\n  were voluntarily and intelligently made.  \r\nPetitioner has presented no evidence his pleas were not knowingly, intelligently, \r\n  and voluntarily entered.  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d \r\n  813, 814 (1985), cert denied, 474 U.S. 1094, 106 S.Ct. 869, 88 \r\n  L.E.2d 908 (1986) (the burden is on the applicant in a post-conviction proceeding \r\n  to prove the allegations in his application).  In regard to the alleged Brady \r\n  violation, petitioner has provided no specifics regarding how counsel was ineffective \r\n  and whether this allegation is even preserved for review.  Therefore, we deny \r\n  petitionerâ€™s request to remand for a reconstruction hearing.   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nPetitionerâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction claims concerning the Cudd-Lovelace, \r\n  P&amp;G Motors, and Bill Willard indictments for second-degree burglary are \r\n  denied.  The Stylette conviction is vacated because the indictment fails to \r\n  allege the necessary elements of second-degree burglary.  Finally, petitionerâ€™s \r\n  request to remand for a reconstruction hearing is denied.  \r\nAFFIRMED \r\n  IN PART AND VACATED IN PART. \r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  BURNETT, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Petitioner has filed multiple PCR and habeas corpus petitions.  Most \r\n    of the procedural history is irrelevant to the issues currently before the \r\n    Court.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Section 16-11-312 (2003) remains unchanged from \r\n    Â§ 16-11-312 (Supp. 1986).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Upon conviction for a serious offense, a person must be sentenced \r\n    to a term of imprisonment for LWOP if that person has two or more prior convictions \r\n    for a serious offense.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(B)(1) (2003).  A second-degree \r\n    burglary conviction pursuant to Â§ 16-11-312(B) qualifies as a serious offense \r\n    for the purpose of enhancement under the recidivist statute, while a second-degree \r\n    burglary conviction pursuant to Â§ 16-11-312(A) does not qualify as a serious \r\n    offense.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(2)(b). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The Stylette indictments charges that:\r\n  \r\n  At a court of General Sessions, \r\n    convened on the 21st day of April, 1986, the Grand Jurors \r\n    of Cherokee County Present upon their oath:\r\n  That [petitioner] did in \r\n    Cherokee County on or about the 29th day of April, 1986, \r\n    did [sic] enter the dwelling of Stylette without consent and with the intent \r\n    to commit a crime therein.\r\n  \r\n  (emphasis added).   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  While petitioner failed to raise this issue in his brief, subject \r\n    matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time by the parties or sua \r\n    sponte by the court.

We affirm the \r\n  circuit court orders.                  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err in finding \r\n  appellant liable for bonds written for the defendantsâ€™ failure to appear in \r\n  court?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant is a licensed \r\n  insurance agency which has been appointed by Frontier Insurance Company (Frontier) \r\n  to act as its agent.

Frontier acts as a surety and \r\n  it posts the required collateral necessary to enable appellant to write bonds.  \r\n\r\nAppellant issued bail bonds \r\n  to three defendants.  When appellant issued the bonds, the â€œOrder Specifying \r\n  Methods and Conditions of Releaseâ€ forms were signed â€œAll Out Bail Bondingâ€ \r\n  and attached to the forms were Powers of Attorney executed by Frontier. [1]   Subsequent to appellant issuing \r\n  the bonds, Frontier determined that it would no longer be licensing agents in \r\n  South Carolina due to the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York \r\n  declaring Frontier insolvent and placing Frontier on rehabilitated status.   \r\n  The South Carolina Department of Insurance has determined to honor the New York \r\n  Order.  \r\nAfter the defendants failed \r\n  to appear as required by the bonds, an estreatment hearing was held in March \r\n  2002 for all three bonds.  Appellant asserted it had been acting as Frontierâ€™s \r\n  agent, and therefore could not be held liable for its acts on behalf of the \r\n  principal.  Appellant asked that the estreatments be stayed pursuant to the \r\n  New York Order of Rehabilitation.  The court allowed the State to estreat the \r\n  bonds. \r\nAppellant asserts that it is not liable on the bonds at issue because it signed \r\n  the bonds only in its capacity as an agent for Frontier.  We disagree.  Proceedings \r\n  to estreat bonds are governed by statute. Surety is defined as â€œone who, with \r\n  the defendant, is liable for the amount of the bail bond upon forfeiture of \r\n  bail.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-10 (11) (2002).  When a bond is violated by the \r\n  defendantâ€™s failure to appear, the State has a right to full estreatment.  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-170 (2003).  \r\nThe Stateâ€™s right to estreatment is governed by contract.  State \r\n  v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 423 S.E.2d 139 (1992).    In the case at hand, \r\n  each bond was signed â€œAll Out Bail Bondingâ€ on the line marked â€œName of Surety.â€  \r\n  There was no indication on the actual bond that Appellant was signing as Power \r\n  of Attorney for Frontier.  When a contract is clear and unequivocal, its meaning \r\n  must be determined by its contents alone.  Dibble v. Dibble, 248 S.C. \r\n  165, 181, 149 S.E.2d 355, 364 (1966).  Looking at the four corners of the document, \r\n  appellant alone was listed as the surety.  The documents attached to the bond \r\n  demonstrate only that Frontier agreed to underwrite the bonds signed by appellant.  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court judge properly estreated the bonds against appellant.  \r\n  The estreatment orders are affirmed.  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justices Alexander \r\n  S. Macaulay and Daniel F. Pieper, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The Power of Attorney form that is attached to \r\n    the release forms says â€œ[Frontier] does make, constitute and appoint the named \r\n    agent its true and lawful Attorney-in-Fact for it and in its name, place and \r\n    stead, to execute seal and deliver for and on its behalf and as its act and \r\n    deed, as surety, a bail bond onlyâ€¦The obligation of the company shall not \r\n    exceed the sum of [amount of bond] and provided this Power-of-Attorney is \r\n    filed with the bond and retained as part of the court records.â€  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25800","title":"Kemp v.

Clark, both of Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood, LLC, \r\n  of Charleston, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We are asked to determine whether \r\n  the circuit court erred by affirming the probate courtâ€™s decision finding appellant \r\n  was not entitled to certain joint account funds following the death of her husband.  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case involves the construction of the will of Colonel William Rawlings \r\n  (Col. Rawlings).  Col. Rawlingsâ€™ adult children (respondents) filed a complaint \r\n  in probate court alleging constructive trust, accounting, and conversion, against \r\n  appellant, who is Col. Rawlingsâ€™ widow.  William L. Shipley, the attorney who \r\n  is the personal representative of Col. Rawlingsâ€™ estate and who drafted the \r\n  will, was named as a party to the action.  Respondents sought to recover funds \r\n  appellant withdrew from joint accounts she held with Col. Rawlings approximately \r\n  a year before his death.\r\nAppellant, who was 78 years old, and Col. Rawlings, who was 77 years old, were \r\n  married in December 1988.  Both Col. Rawlings and appellant had adult children \r\n  from prior marriages.  In 1990, Col. Rawlings executed his will with the assistance \r\n  of Attorney Shipley.  The pertinent portions of the will state:\r\n\r\nITEM III:    I have made adequate provisions for my beloved wife, SNODA \r\n  ELIZABETH A. RAWLINGS, as we have a joint or survivorship bank account or \r\n  joint or survivorship savings account and she is entitled to and I give \r\n  and bequeath all funds in said account except for any Certificates of Deposit \r\n  accounts which are not joint or survivorship accounts.  . . . \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  Col. Rawlings left the residue of his property to respondents.\r\nAttorney Shipley testified Col. Rawlings told him he had accounts \r\n  solely in his name and joint accounts with appellant, none of which were identified \r\n  by bank or by account number.  Shipley testified Col. Rawlings stated his intent \r\n  was to ensure appellant was well taken care of with all of his joint accounts \r\n  if he predeceased her.\r\nAt the time the will was executed, Col. Rawlings and appellant had \r\n  a joint checking and a joint savings account at C&amp;S National Bank of South \r\n  Carolina.  When NationsBank acquired C&amp;S Bank in 1991, those accounts were \r\n  converted to NationsBank accounts.  Subsequently, Col. Rawlings withdrew $80,000 \r\n  from the NationsBank joint savings account and opened a joint brokerage account \r\n  with appellant at First Union.  In 1995, Col. Rawlings closed the First Union \r\n  joint brokerage account and opened a new joint brokerage account with appellant \r\n  at Wachovia.  He also opened a joint checking account with appellant at Wachovia.  \r\n  He later closed the NationsBank accounts.\r\nIn 1997, Col. Rawlings, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized.  \r\n  He was subsequently transferred to Roper Care Alliance and remained there for \r\n  a month.  When he returned home, he was cared for by appellant and paid sitters.  \r\n  A year later, when appellant could no longer care for Col. Rawlings at home, \r\n  he was placed in the Charleston VA Hospital nursing facility.  Appellant then \r\n  instituted a guardianship/conservatorship action and, in February 1999, appellant \r\n  was appointed to be Col. Rawlingsâ€™ guardian and conservator.\r\nApproximately two months before the petition was filed to declare \r\n  Col. Rawlings incompetent, appellant, on the advice of counsel, withdrew over \r\n  $130,000 from the Wachovia brokerage account she shared with him and deposited \r\n  them into her individual Wachovia brokerage account.  Thereafter, she placed \r\n  $30,000 of those funds in Col. Rawlingsâ€™ conservatorship account.  Some of the \r\n  funds were withdrawn as cash and have not been accounted for; however, appellant \r\n  indicated this money was spent on Col. Rawlingsâ€™ medical care and home sitting \r\n  care.\r\nAfter a trial, the probate court found for respondents on the constructive \r\n  trust and accounting claims, but declined to award any additional damages on \r\n  the conversion claim.  The probate court found Col. Rawlings bequeathed to appellant \r\n  only the joint accounts existing at the time he executed the will and not the \r\n  joint accounts existing at his death, that the bequest to appellant had adeemed, \r\n  that the funds in the joint accounts opened after the execution of the will \r\n  belonged to Col. Rawlings during his lifetime, and that appellant would be required \r\n  to repay the funds she withdrew from those joint accounts to the estate.\r\nThe probate court imposed a constructive trust against appellant in the amount \r\n  of $225,162.70.  Attorney Shipley, as personal representative of the estate, \r\n  was ordered to pay respondentsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s and accountantâ€™s fees out of the \r\n  estate prior to appellantâ€™s exercising her right to an elective share pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-201 (Supp. 2003). [1]  Appellant appealed to the circuit court, which \r\n  affirmed the probate court.          \r\nISSUE I\r\n\r\nDid the probate court err by finding appellant was not entitled to the funds \r\n  in the joint accounts under the will?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues the probate court erred by finding Col. Rawlings intended \r\n  to leave only the joint accounts existing at the time he executed the will, \r\n  i.e. the C&amp;S Bank joint checking and savings accounts, to her. [2] \r\nAn action to construe a will is an action at law.  Bob Jones Univ. v. Strandell, \r\n  344 S.C. 224, 543 S.E.2d 251 (Ct. App. 2001).  When reviewing an action at law, \r\n  on appeal of a case tried without a jury, our jurisdiction is limited to the \r\n  correction of errors of law and this Court will not disturb the judgeâ€™s findings \r\n  of fact unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s \r\n  findings.  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 \r\n  S.E.2d 773 (1976).\r\nThe cardinal rule of will construction is the determination of the \r\n  testatorâ€™s intent.  Matter of Clark, 308 S.C. 328, 417 S.E.2d 856 (1992).  \r\n  A will must be read in the ordinary and grammatical sense of the words employed, \r\n  unless some obvious absurdity, repugnancy, or inconsistency with the declared \r\n  intention of the testator, as abstracted from the whole will, would follow from \r\n  such construction.  Id.  The rules of construction are subservient to \r\n  the primary consideration of ascertaining what the testator meant by the terms \r\n  used in the written instrument itself, and each item of a will must be considered \r\n  in relation to other portions.  Allison v. Wilson, 306 S.C. 274, 411 \r\n  S.E.2d 433 (1991).  Every word or phrase in a will must be considered and, if \r\n  practicable, effect must be given to them.  Id.  An interpretation that \r\n  fits into the whole scheme or plan of the will is most apt to be the correct \r\n  interpretation of the intent of the testator.  Lemmon v. Wilson, 204 \r\n  S.C. 50, 28 S.E.2d 792 (1944).\r\nFrom the terms of the will, it appears the intent of Col. Rawlings \r\n  in making the bequest to appellant was to make an adequate provision for her \r\n  through their joint bank accounts.  However, as the probate court found, extrinsic \r\n  evidence is admissible to determine if there is a latent ambiguity in the will.  \r\n  If there is such an ambiguity, then the court may also consider extrinsic evidence \r\n  to determine whether Col. Rawlings intended to leave appellant only the C&amp;S \r\n  Bank joint accounts they had at the time the will was executed or whether he \r\n  intended to leave appellant the joint bank accounts that existed at the time \r\n  of his death.  See Bob Jones Univ., supra (court may admit \r\n  extrinsic evidence to determine whether latent ambiguity exists; once \r\n  the court finds latent ambiguity, extrinsic evidence is also permitted to determine \r\n  testatorâ€™s intent.).  A latent ambiguity is one in which the uncertainty arises, \r\n  not upon the words of the instrument as looked at in themselves, but upon those \r\n  words when applied to the object or subject which they describe.  Id.\r\nA latent ambiguity is present in Col. Rawlingsâ€™ will.  The words \r\n  of the will bequeath the joint bank account or joint savings account appellant \r\n  and Col. Rawlings have.  When applying those words, especially the word â€œhave,â€ \r\n  an ambiguity arises as to whether Col. Rawlings intended to leave only the C&amp;S \r\n  joint bank accounts to appellant because those were the accounts they had at \r\n  the time the will was executed, or whether he intended to leave any joint bank \r\n  account to appellant.  Evidence of Col. Rawlingsâ€™ intent can be found in the \r\n  will and from Attorney Shipleyâ€™s testimony.\r\nThe will provides that Col. Rawlings has â€œmade adequate provisions \r\n  for [his] beloved wifeâ€ through a joint bank account they â€œhave.â€  This indicates \r\n  his intention that he desires his wife to be adequately provided for.  Further, \r\n  Attorney Shipley testified that, by his will, Col. Rawlings intended that appellant \r\n  should be well taken care of with â€œall of his joint accountsâ€ if he predeceased \r\n  her. \r\nAt Col. Rawlingsâ€™ death, the C&amp;S Bank joint accounts were no \r\n  longer in existence; however, Col. Rawlings transferred the funds in those accounts \r\n  (after a series of transfers) to Wachovia in bank accounts held jointly with \r\n  appellant.  Given Col. Rawlingsâ€™ intent and the fact that he is presumed to \r\n  know that a will speaks at death, the probate court erred by finding that, under \r\n  the will, appellant was not entitled to the joint accounts she and Col. Rawlings \r\n  held at the time of his death.  See Shelley v. Shelley, 244 S.C. \r\n  598, 137 S.E.2d 851 (1964) (will speaks at death); In re Estate \r\n  of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 539 S.E.2d 703 (2000) (everyone is presumed to \r\n  have knowledge of the law).  Further, the probate court erred by adding language \r\n  to the terms of Col. Rawlingsâ€™ will, i.e. by finding the joint account \r\n  language referred only to joint accounts held at C&amp;S Bank.  There is no \r\n  evidence to reasonably support the probate courtâ€™s interpretation of the will.  \r\n  See Townes Assocs., Ltd., supra (judgeâ€™s findings of fact \r\n  will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  judgeâ€™s findings).\r\nAccordingly, under the will, appellant is entitled to the funds in \r\n  those accounts. [3]   Further, as will be discussed \r\n  infra, appellant is not required to return the funds she withdrew from \r\n  the joint accounts to the estate.\r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nDid appellantâ€™s withdrawal of funds from the joint accounts before Col. Rawlingsâ€™ \r\n  death cause the funds to become assets of the estate?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues her withdrawal of funds from the joint accounts prior to Col. \r\n  Rawlingsâ€™ death did not cause the funds to become assets of the estate given \r\n  he intended for her to have those funds.\r\nEvents similar to the instant case occurred in Vaughn v. Bernhardt, \r\n  345 S.C. 196, 547 S.E.2d 869 (2001), although there was not a will at issue.  \r\n  In Vaughn, the decedent held joint accounts, to which she was the sole \r\n  contributor, with her nephew.  A few days before her death, the nephew withdrew \r\n  all of the funds from those accounts.  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-6-103(a), \r\n  62-6-104(a), and 62-6-101(13) (1987), \r\n  [4]  we held the nephew was not entitled to the funds because the funds \r\n  belonged to the decedent during her lifetime and did not belong to the nephew, \r\n  such that he could withdraw the funds, prior to her death.\r\nBecause there was only $442 left in one of the joint accounts when \r\n  Col. Rawlings died, the probate court correctly held appellant is entitled to \r\n  the survivorship presumption as to that $442.  However, as the probate court \r\n  found, citing Vaughn, she is not entitled to the survivorship presumption \r\n  as to the funds she withdrew.  Appellant did not contribute any money to the \r\n  joint accounts.  Thus, under section 62-6-103(a), all of the funds from the \r\n  Wachovia joint accounts belonged to Col. Rawlings during his lifetime because \r\n  he was the sole contributor.  Appellant had withdrawn almost all of the funds \r\n  and deposited them into her own accounts.  Therefore, she cannot claim ownership \r\n  of the funds based on Â§ 62-6-104(a), the right of survivorship provision.\r\nHowever, under the will, appellant is entitled to the funds she withdrew \r\n  prior to Col. Rawlingsâ€™ death.  In Vaughn, we stated that, â€œ[w]hile the \r\n  Decedent may well have intended for [the nephew]to receive the Joint Accountsâ€™ \r\n  funds after her death, the nephew chose to rely solely on the statutory presumption \r\n  and did not present other evidence of intent.â€  See also Â§ 62-6-103(a) \r\n  (joint account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to parties in proportion \r\n  to net contributions by each to sums on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing \r\n  evidence of different intent).  In the instant case, appellant has presented \r\n  â€œother evidence of intentâ€ that Col. Rawlings intended for appellant to receive \r\n  the joint accountsâ€™ funds after his death.  This â€œother evidence of intentâ€ \r\n  is in the form of Col. Rawlingsâ€™ will wherein he gave and bequeathed to appellant \r\n  the funds in their joint account.  Given our conclusion that, under the will, \r\n  Col. Rawlings intended to give appellant the funds in the joint accounts, this \r\n  is evidence of Col. Rawlingsâ€™ intent for appellant to receive those funds regardless \r\n  of whether she withdrew them prior to his death.\r\nAccordingly, the probate court erred by finding appellant was not \r\n  entitled to the funds she had withdrawn from the joint accounts as against Col. \r\n  Rawlingsâ€™ estate.\r\nISSUE III\r\n\r\nDid the probate court err by finding respondents are entitled to an award of \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and accountantâ€™s fees?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe probate court held respondents were entitled to have their attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  and accountantâ€™s fees paid out of the estate since they were compelled to bring \r\n  this action and the action benefited the common fund of Col. Rawlingsâ€™ estate.  \r\n  However, because appellant is entitled to keep the funds she withdrew from the \r\n  joint accounts she held with Col. Rawlings, the probate courtâ€™s ruling that \r\n  respondentsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s fees and accountantâ€™s fees should be paid out of the \r\n  estate is reversed. [5] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the circuit court erred by affirming the probate courtâ€™s \r\n  decision denying appellant her entitlement to the funds, some of which were \r\n  previously withdrawn by her, from the joint accounts she held with her husband \r\n  prior to his death.  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Roger M. \r\n  Young, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Section \r\n    62-2-201 provides that if a married person domiciled in this state dies, the \r\n    surviving spouse has a right of election to take an elective share of one-third \r\n    of the decedentâ€™s probate estate.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Appellant makes a res judicata \r\n    argument that the probate court had already ruled on the proper disposition \r\n    of the proceeds of the accounts in its order in the guardianship/conservatorship \r\n    action.  However, the probate court did not in fact rule on how the funds \r\n    should be distributed and specifically reserved ruling on that issue until \r\n    a later date.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Given \r\n    our conclusion that Col. Rawlingsâ€™ intention in the will was to provide for \r\n    appellant by giving her the funds in any joint accounts they may have, it \r\n    is unnecessary to address appellantâ€™s argument that the probate court erred \r\n    by finding the bequest of funds to appellant had adeemed.  See Rikard \r\n    v. Miller, 231 S.C. 98, 97 S.E.2d 257 (1957) (specific legacies are adeemed \r\n    when thing bequeathed is, in testatorâ€™s lifetime, lost, disposed of, or so \r\n    substantially changed or altered as not to exist in kind when will takes effect). \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Section 62-6-103(a) provides, \r\n    â€œA joint account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to the \r\n    parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit, \r\n    unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.â€  (Emphasis \r\n    added).  Section 62-6-104(a) provides that any sums â€œremaining on depositâ€ \r\n    at the time of the death of one of the parties to the account belong to the \r\n    surviving party or parties as against the estate of the decedent.

Clary, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25801\r\nHeard February 4, 2004 - Filed April \r\n  5, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan\r\nMcMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\nDeputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, Assistant \r\n  Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and Harold W. Gowdy, III, \r\n  of Spartanburg, for Petitioner. \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, of \r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  The State argues that \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred when it held that Respondentâ€™s two prior convictions \r\n  of armed robbery constituted one offense under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-50 (1985).  \r\n  We disagree and affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nRespondent Minyard Woody \r\n  (â€œRespondentâ€) was convicted of second-degree burglary in July 1999.  During \r\n  trial, the State argued that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 2000) mandated \r\n  a life sentence without the possibility of parole because Respondent had been \r\n  convicted of two counts of armed robbery on January 21, 1981.  The two previous \r\n  armed robbery convictions stemmed from a single incident but involved two different \r\n  victims:  Respondent robbed a Fast Fare convenient store and was convicted of \r\n  armed robbery of both the storeâ€™s clerk and the store itself.\r\nThe trial judge sentenced \r\n  Respondent to a life sentence without the possibility of parole pursuant to \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 2000). [1]   The Court of Appeals reversed \r\n  and held that Respondentâ€™s two prior convictions were the same offense under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-50 (1985), and therefore the â€œthree strikes ruleâ€ of \r\n  section 17-25-45 - requiring a life sentence without the possibility of parole \r\n  when convicted of three â€œseriousâ€ crimes - does not apply.  The State submits \r\n  the following issue on appeal:\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals \r\n  err in holding that Respondentâ€™s two prior convictions constituted one offense \r\n  under section 17-25-50? \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nIn 2003, this Court published \r\n  two opinions addressing issues similar to those in the present case.  State \r\n  v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 588 S.E.2d 105 (2003); State v. Benjamin, \r\n  353 S.C. 441, 579 S.E.2d 289 (2003). The holdings of those cases are somewhat \r\n  inconsistent, due to the contradictory language between sections 17-25-45 and \r\n  17-25-50.  \r\nSection 17-25-45(B) mandates \r\n  that criminal defendants who are convicted of three â€œmost seriousâ€ or â€œseriousâ€ \r\n  crimes be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. \r\n  [2]   \r\nOn the other hand, section \r\n  17-25-50, entitled â€œConsidering closely connected offenses as one offenseâ€ states: \r\n\r\n\r\n[i]n determining the number \r\n  of offenses for the purpose of imposition of sentence, the court shall treat \r\n  as one offense any number of offenses which have been committed at times so \r\n  closely connected in point of time that they may be considered as one offense, \r\n  notwithstanding under the law they constitute separate and distinct offenses.\r\n\r\nHowever, section 17-25-45(B) \r\n  begins with the phrase: â€œ[n]otwithstanding any other provision of lawâ€¦,â€ indicating \r\n  that it should be interpreted and enforced in isolation of other applicable \r\n  sections, such as section 17-25-50.  Further, in July 2003, this Court held \r\n  that section 17-25-50 is inapplicable in a â€œthree strikes ruleâ€ analysis. State \r\n  v. Benjamin, 353 S.C. 441, 579 S.E.2d 289 (2003).  This Court opined:\r\n\r\nthat the legislature intends that Â§ 17-25-45 be construed independent of any \r\n  other statute is reinforced by the introductory language of subsections (E) \r\n  and (F), both of which begin â€œFor purposes of determining a prior conviction \r\n  under this section onlyâ€¦.â€  It is no longer necessary or appropriate to harmonize \r\n  or reconcile Â§ 17-25-45 and Â§ 17-25-50 in light of the General Assemblyâ€™s unmistakable \r\n  instruction that Â§ 17-25-45 be applied without regard to any other provision \r\n  of law.\r\n\r\n353 S.C. 441, 445, 579 S.E.2d 289, 291 (2003).\r\nHowever, in October 2003, \r\n  after these parties submitted their briefs, this Court overturned Benjamin \r\n  in State v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 152, 588 S.E.2d 105, 109 (2003), holding \r\n  that the two statutes must be construed together, otherwise section 17-25-50 \r\n  is utterly useless.            \r\nIn the present case, Respondentâ€™s \r\n  prior criminal record included two convictions of armed robbery.  Given this \r\n  Courtâ€™s recent ruling in State v. Gordon, and the fact that the offenses \r\n  were committed at the same time, the two offenses constitute only one offense \r\n  under section 17-25-50.  Accordingly, Respondent has only two strikes against \r\n  him, not three.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  decision, holding that Respondentâ€™s two prior convictions of armed robbery constitute \r\n  one offense. \r\nMOORE, J., and Acting \r\n  Justices Daniel F. Pieper and Alexander S. Macaulay, concur.  PLEICONES, J., \r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I respectfully dissent.  I continue to adhere to \r\n  my opinion in State v. Benjamin, 353 S.C. 441, 579 S.E.2d 289 (2003), \r\n  which was overruled by State v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 588 S.E.2d 105 \r\n  (2003).  In my opinion, Benjamin correctly analyzed the seeming tension \r\n  between S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 2000) and Â§ 17-25-50 (1985).

Taggart of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  We granted certiorari to review \r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in State v. Brown, 351 S.C. 522, 570 S.E.2d \r\n  559 (Ct. App. 2002).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nBrown received a traffic citation on March 13, 1996, in Greenwood County, for \r\n  Failure to Register a Vehicle and Operating an Uninsured Vehicle.  A trial was \r\n  held in Greenwood County by a magistrate on May 8, 1997.  After Brown was convicted, \r\n  he moved for a new trial.  A new trial was granted by the magistrate.  \r\nAt his second trial on July 16, 1997, Brown was found guilty by a \r\n  Greenwood County jury, Magistrate Lasonia Williamsâ€™ presiding.  Judge Williams \r\n  sentenced Brown to 40 days in jail, or payment of a fine.  Since Brown could \r\n  not pay the fine, he immediately went to jail. Brown served the full sentence.  \r\n\r\nOn August 6, 1997, Judge Williams received a written notice of appeal \r\n  from the second Greenwood County magistrateâ€™s trial, which was filed in the \r\n  Clerkâ€™s office on August 27, 1997.  On September 2, 1997, Judge Williams filed \r\n  an Answer to the Appeal.  On October 1, 1997, Brownâ€™s appeal came before Circuit \r\n  Judge Johnson, who reversed the jury verdict and remanded the case for a new \r\n  trial.  The Order granting a new trial stated that while Brown had successfully \r\n  moved for a change of venue, venue had not in fact been changed.  [1]   Judge Johnson also reversed \r\n  on another ground, which is not at issue in this case.  \r\nAt this point in the proceedings, the Chief Magistrate of Greenwood County \r\n  coordinated with the Abbeville County Chief Magistrate to comply with their \r\n  mutual understanding of Judge Johnsonâ€™s 1997 Order requiring a change of venue. \r\n  After consultation, the charges were transferred to Abbeville County for trial.  \r\n\r\nA third trial was conducted by Abbeville Magistrate G.T. Ferguson, and Brown \r\n  was again convicted.  Although Brown had initially sought a change of venue \r\n  to another county, he objected to being tried in Abbeville County prior to the \r\n  proceedings there.  Brown, again, appealed his conviction to Circuit Court and \r\n  the conviction was affirmed on October 13, 2000.  In his order, Judge Johnson \r\n  stated:\r\n\r\nVenue was proper in Abbeville County since Defendant \r\n  had previously requested a change of venue in Greenwood.  Greenwood County has \r\n  only one magistrate district.  The only place to change venue was to an adjoining \r\n  countyâ€¦The verdict of the lower court is affirmed. \r\n\r\nBrown appealed to the Court of Appeals.\r\nDuring oral argument, the Court of Appeals sua sponte raised \r\n  the issue whether the Circuit Court had subject matter jurisdiction to reverse \r\n  the 1997 convictions from the second Greenwood County trial given the fact that \r\n  Brown did not serve his notice of appeal on Judge Williams within 10 days of \r\n  his convictions.  The Court asked whether Brown had moved for a new trial since \r\n  moving for a new trial extends oneâ€™s deadline to appeal from magistrateâ€™s court.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-1000 (Supp. 1996). [2]   The Court gave Brown â€œten days within which \r\n  to provide this Court with a copy of the motion for a new trial that he filed.â€  \r\n  Brown, 570 S.E.2d at 559 n. 2  (Judge Connorâ€™s dissent quoting from oral \r\n  argument).   \r\nBrown, instead, filed two affidavits, his, \r\n  and one from a third party who attended the second 1997 trial.  The affidavits \r\n  state that Brown moved for a new trial immediately following the announcement \r\n  of the verdict. The State filed a Motion Objecting to Consideration of Affidavits.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals found that Brown made a timely motion for a new trial and \r\n  thus the 1997 Greenwood County appeal had been properly before the circuit court.  \r\n  Further, it vacated the 2000 Abbeville convictions, holding that a criminal \r\n  action must be brought before a magistrate with jurisdiction in the county where \r\n  the alleged offense occurred.   The Court of Appeals concluded that the Abbeville \r\n  magistrate had no subject matter jurisdiction to try Brown on these Greenwood \r\n  charges.  The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which was granted.  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\nA. Did the Court of Appeals err \r\n  in concluding the 1997 appeal from Brownâ€™s second Greenwood County conviction \r\n  was timely?\r\nB. Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the Abbeville \r\n  County Magistrateâ€™s Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to try Brown?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.  Did the Court of Appeals err \r\n  in concluding the appeal from Brownâ€™s second Greenwood County conviction was \r\n  timely?\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in concluding the appeal from Brownâ€™s second conviction \r\n  was timely.  The Court of Appeals considered two affidavits, which were not \r\n  included in the record on appeal, in determining that Brown filed a timely notice \r\n  of appeal.  The Court stated it could consider these affidavits because: (1) \r\n  â€œjustice dictates that the resolution of issues pertaining to subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction be a paramount concern for our courtsâ€; (2) â€œissues concerning \r\n  the existence of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time and by \r\n  any party or the courtâ€; (3) â€œthe affidavits were submitted pursuant to the \r\n  Courtâ€™s invitation and were necessary for the crucial determination of whether \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction existed.  The affidavits submitted by Brown are \r\n  therefore deemed a part of the record.â€  Brown, 570 S.E.2d at 562.  \r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in considering these affidavits.  First, there is \r\n  no question of subject matter jurisdiction.  In Great Games, Inc. v. South \r\n  Carolina Dept. of Rev., 339 S.C. 79, 529 S.E.2d 6 (2000), this Court addressed \r\n  whether a circuit court lost â€œsubject matterâ€ jurisdiction over an appeal because \r\n  the defendant failed to meet the requirement of posting a bond or paying a fine \r\n  before appealing.   In a footnote, this Court stated: \r\n\r\n[t]he circuit court erroneously characterized the jurisdictional defect as \r\n  one relating to the courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction.  Subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  refers to the courtâ€™s â€œpower to hear and determine cases of the general class \r\n  to which the proceedings in question belongâ€â€¦ The failure of a party to comply \r\n  with the procedural requirements for perfecting an appeal may deprive the court \r\n  of â€œappellateâ€ jurisdiction over the case, but it does not affect the courtâ€™s \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction. (emphasis supplied) (internal citations omitted). \r\n  Great Games, 529 S.E.2d at 83 n.5.  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, this Court has held the failure to comply with procedural requirements \r\n  for an appeal divests a court of appellate jurisdiction, not the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction was implicated by the failure to timely appeal a \r\n  conviction from magistrateâ€™s court.  Circuit court has the power to hear and \r\n  determine this class of appeals.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-5-340 (1976).  \r\nFurther, in Judge Williamsâ€™ Answer to an Appeal, she stated, â€œ[t]his Court \r\n  does recognize that Section 22-3-1000 of South Carolina Code of Laws does give \r\n  the appellant an additional 25 days, but only after the denial of a motion \r\n  for a new trial.  This Court never received such motion from the Defendant.  \r\n  He has only filed an appeal for reversal of the jury verdict in which he was \r\n  found guilty of Failing to register a vehicle and Operating an uninsured vehicle.  \r\n  The Court feels this appeal was not timely filed and that the jury verdict \r\n  should not be reversed.â€  (emphasis supplied).   \r\nThis Court has held that it is error for the Court of Appeals to consider facts \r\n  not included in the magistrateâ€™s return.  State v. Osborne, 335 S.C. \r\n  172, 176 n. 6, 516 S.E.2d 201, 203 n. 6 (1999)(holding that it was error for \r\n  the Court of Appeals to rely on the recitation of facts contained in an appellate \r\n  order instead of restricting itself to the facts contained in the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  return).  See also State v. Barbee, 280 S.C. 328, 313 S.E.2d \r\n  297 (1984)(magistrateâ€™s return is the official record of trial proceedings); \r\n  State v. Sarvis, 265 S.C. 144, 147, 217 S.E.2d 38, 39 (1975)(â€œWhile the \r\n  arguments indicate some disagreement as to the facts, we are bound by the Return \r\n  of the magistrate before whom the respondent was triedâ€).  \r\nJudge Williams clearly stated in her Return that Brown did not move for a new \r\n  trial.  The Court of Appeals was bound by this factual determination and erred \r\n  in considering the two affidavits, which were outside the Record on Appeal.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe 1997 appeal from the Greenwood County Magistrate conviction was untimely.  \r\n  Accordingly, these convictions from the second Greenwood County trial stand, \r\n  and the Abbeville case is a nullity.  The decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\n  REVERSED.  We need not reach the issue whether a magistrate can effectuate an \r\n  inter-county transfer on criminal charges, nor the effect, if any, of the fact \r\n  that Brown has already served his entire sentence on these charges.  \r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, J., and Acting Justices Alison R. Lee and \r\n  G. Thomas Cooper, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Actually, venue had already been changed.  Greenwood County \r\n    has a central magistrate court since it is only one district.  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 22-2-190 (24) (1989).  When a party wants to change venue in a magistrate \r\n    court with one district, â€œthe papers shall be turned over to the nearest magistrate \r\n    not disqualified from hearing the cause in the county, who shall proceed to \r\n    try the case as if he had issued the warrant or summons.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n    22-3-920 (1989).    Unlike circuit court, change of venue in a magistrate \r\n    court with only one district ordinarily means changing judges, not place of \r\n    trial.  In this case, the second Greenwood County case was originally in front \r\n    of Judge Cantrell and Brown requested a change of venue.  Accordingly, the \r\n    case was properly transferred to Judge Williams, another magistrate within \r\n    Greenwood County.  Only one change of venue transfer of right is allowed to \r\n    each party in a magistrate court.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-920 (1989).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Brownâ€™s convictions were in 1997.  At that time \r\n    the deadline to serve an appeal was twenty-five days after the magistrateâ€™s \r\n    grant or denial of a motion for a new trial.  S.C. Code Ann.

Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel. \r\nDaniel F. Norfleet, of Summerville, pro \r\n  se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary \r\n  matter, formal charges were filed against Respondent four times between December \r\n  12, 2000 and June 13, 2001.  On March 26, 2002, a hearing was held to address \r\n  the various charges.  The full panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (â€œCommissionâ€) \r\n  adopted the sub-panelâ€™s report, and recommended Daniel F. Norfleet (â€œRespondentâ€) \r\n  be suspended from the practice of law for a period of two years, with conditions.  \r\n  The Commission recommended Respondent be required to undergo instruction in \r\n  law office management, with a particular emphasis on trust account management, \r\n  along with counseling in civility and appropriate conduct toward clients and \r\n  others.  The Commission also recommended that Respondent be required to make \r\n  restitution to Wayne Howard in the amount of $8,381.52 and to pay the costs \r\n  of the Commissionâ€™s proceedings, in the amount of $2,164.37.  We find the gravity \r\n  of Respondentâ€™s misconduct justifies harsher sanctions.  Therefore, we hereby \r\n  impose an indefinite suspension, with conditions, effective as of the date of \r\n  this opinion.\r\nFirst Formal Charges\r\n\r\n The Byron Matter (Charlotte Riley Complaint)\r\n\r\nThe Commission found Respondent made false \r\n  statements, commingled funds, and mismanaged his trust account in connection \r\n  with this matter. \r\n Respondent was the closing attorney in a real \r\n  estate transaction for Patrick Byron in February 2002.  As a result of the closing, \r\n  two loans with Carolina First Bank were to be satisfied.  Respondentâ€™s first \r\n  check, issued from his trust account satisfied the first mortgage.  The second \r\n  check, made payable to Carolina First Bank in the amount of $8,739.77, for satisfaction \r\n  of the second mortgage, was returned for non-sufficient funds. [1]  The second check was used to purchase \r\n  two certified checks from Carolina First Bank in the amounts of $8,731.44 and \r\n  $8.33.\r\nRespondentâ€™s wife, who was serving as his \r\n  bookkeeper, secretary, and office manager testified she used the second trust \r\n  account check to purchase the two cashiers checks and was aware that the account \r\n  may not have had sufficient funds to cover the trust account check.  She testified \r\n  she concealed her actions from her husband.  The Commission found the requirements \r\n  of Rule 417, SCACR, regarding use, balancing, and maintenance of a trust account \r\n  were incumbent on Respondent, not his wife.  \r\nDuring this same time period, Respondent represented \r\n  Wayne Howard in a Workers Compensation case.  The case settled and the attorney \r\n  for the defendantâ€™s insurance carrier mailed Respondent a letter enclosing a \r\n  draft payable jointly to Mr. Howard and Respondent in the amount of $8,381.51.  \r\n  The letter accompanying the draft instructed Respondent not to negotiate the \r\n  insurance companyâ€™s draft until he had completed and mailed to opposing counsel \r\n  the Final Lump Sum Agreement and Release, with the endorsement of the Workers \r\n  Compensation Commission.  Respondent did not follow the instructions in the \r\n  letter.  The draft, drawn on the account of Huron Insurance Company, was endorsed \r\n  by Respondentâ€™s wife and deposited in Respondentâ€™s trust account.  With this \r\n  deposit, sufficient funds were on deposit in Respondentâ€™s trust account to purchase \r\n  another check, payable to Carolina First Bank in the amount of $8,739.77, which \r\n  was used to pay off the Byronâ€™s second mortgage.  \r\nThe Commission found Respondent made a false \r\n  statement to Wayne Howard in a letter dated August 4, 2000, in which he stated \r\n  the settlement check he had received was stale and must be reissued.  The Commission \r\n  concluded Respondent misrepresented to his client Respondentâ€™s receipt of the \r\n  settlement check.  \r\n\r\n Vaughan Realty Matter\r\n\r\nThe Commission found Respondent commingled funds.\r\nOn January 7, 2000, Respondent closed a real \r\n  estate transaction between Vaughan Homes and Rebecca Moore.  Respondent issued \r\n  a trust account check for $2,378.25, dated January 7, 2000, payable to Vaughan \r\n  Realty, Inc., as commission.  The check was returned for non-sufficient funds.\r\nMatthew Neylon, an official with Vaughan Homes, \r\n  Inc., telephoned Respondentâ€™s office several times.  Neylon received a cashierâ€™s \r\n  check from Respondentâ€™s office in satisfaction of the commission obligation.\r\nThe Commission concluded that since the Vaughan \r\n  Realty check had been returned, monies used to replace it must have come from \r\n  a source other than the Vaughan/Moore real estate closing.\r\n\r\n Additional Trust Account Mismanagement\r\n\r\nIn connection with the following incidents, \r\n  the Commission found Respondent failed to maintain control over his trust account.  \r\n\r\nRespondent wrote a check for $950 from the \r\n  Wyckoff and Norfleet trust account to pay his office rent.  Additionally, the \r\n  Commission received evidence showing the trust account had a negative balance \r\n  in December 1999, February 2000, and March 2000.  Between December 1, 1999, \r\n  and March 31, 2000, Respondent had six instances of overdraft fees and seven \r\n  instances of NSF fees.  \r\n\r\n Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Charges\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to reply to two letters \r\n  from the Commission concerning the Byron real estate transaction.  Additionally, \r\n  Respondent did not reply to the Commissionâ€™s Notice of Full Investigation, which \r\n  was returned unclaimed by the postal service following three attempts of service.  \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;  Withholding Taxes\r\n\r\nThe Commission found Respondent failed \r\n  to withhold from his employees certain taxes on behalf of the State of South \r\n  Carolina, thereby breaching his fiduciary duty owed to the State of South Carolina.  \r\n  The Commission received into evidence a series of South Carolina Department \r\n  of Revenue Warrants for Distraint filed against Respondent.  Additionally, Respondent \r\n  has not filed personal income tax returns since 1996.\r\nSub-panelâ€™s Findings\r\nThe sub-panel found Respondent had committed \r\n  attorney misconduct, in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR, and Rule 7 of Rule 413, SCACR.  The sub-panel found violations \r\n  of numerous provisions of Rule 407, particularly Rule 1.1 (competence); Rule \r\n  1.3 (diligence); Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property); Rule 1.5 (fees); Rule 4.1 \r\n  (truthfulness in statements to others); Rule 8.1(b)(knowingly failing to respond \r\n  to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); and Rule \r\n  8.4 (misconduct), subsections (a) (violating a rule of professional conduct), \r\n  (c) (conduct involving moral turpitude) and (d) (conduct involving dishonesty, \r\n  fraud, deceit or misrepresentation) and (e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration \r\n  of justice).  \r\nFrom Rule 7 of Rule 413, Rules for Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, SCACR, the sub-panel found Respondent had violated \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (violating a Rule of Professional Conduct;); Rule 7(a)(5) (conduct \r\n  tending to pollute the administration of justice or bring the legal profession \r\n  into disrepute or demonstrate an unfitness to practice law); Rule 7(a)(6) (violating \r\n  the oath of office taken upon admission to practice in this State); and Rule \r\n  7(a)(3) (knowingly failing to respond to a demand from a disciplinary authority).\r\nSecond Formal Charges\r\n\r\n Leroy Ferrell Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Leroy Ferrell in a \r\n  post-conviction relief matter.  Ferrellâ€™s case was dismissed.  Ferrell testified \r\n  that he requested Respondent appeal the order of dismissal, but Respondent failed \r\n  to do so.  Respondent testified he did not appeal the order because he believed \r\n  it was not meritorious. \r\nThe Commission did not find clear and convincing \r\n  evidence of attorney misconduct, finding â€œcredence in Respondentâ€™s contention \r\n  that he believed further appeal on Mr. Ferrellâ€™s behalf would have been fruitless.â€\r\n\r\n Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Charges\r\n\r\nThe Commission concluded Respondent failed \r\n  to respond to a Notice of Full Investigation mailed to Respondent on or about \r\n  November 2, 2000, in connection with the Leroy Ferrell matter.  The notice was \r\n  returned as unclaimed by the U.S. Postal Service. \r\n Respondent stated he was living in Florida \r\n  at the time of the November 2, 2000, mailing and that he advised the Commission \r\n  of his whereabouts.  Although the Commission found there was evidence that Respondent \r\n  failed to respond, the Commission found Respondentâ€™s contention he was living \r\n  in Florida to be a mitigating factor.\r\nSub-panelâ€™s Findings\r\nThe sub-panel found Respondent committed attorney \r\n  misconduct, in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR, and Rule 7 of Rule 413, SCACR.  The sub-panel concluded Respondent violated \r\n  Rule 1.1 (competence), Rule 8.1(b) (failing to respond to a lawful demand for \r\n  information from a disciplinary authority), and Rule 8.4, subsections (a) (violating \r\n  a Rule of Professional Conduct) and (e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration \r\n  of justice).  \r\nThird Formal Charges\r\nThe Commission concluded Respondent committed \r\n  two violations in connection with his representation of Jimmy Ray Stroud in \r\n  litigation against Randy and Christina Read and Christinaâ€™s parents Mr. and \r\n  Mrs. Rickard.  The litigation primarily involved visitation disputes concerning \r\n  Mary Paige Stroud, a daughter born to Jimmy Ray Stroud and Christina Read during \r\n  their marriage.\r\n\r\n Unprofessional Conduct\r\n\r\nMary Paige Stroud was enrolled at Hilton Head \r\n  Elementary School.  Gretchen Keefner, a principal at the school, testified Respondent \r\n  unexpectedly came to the school and requested to view Paigeâ€™s school records \r\n  and visit with her.  Keefner testified Respondent did not present any identification \r\n  and was dressed in casual attire.  Keefner further testified Respondent became \r\n  verbally abusive when she refused him access to her file.  Specifically, Keefner \r\n  testified Respondent threatened to sue her personally and have her fired if \r\n  she did not turn over the file.\r\nWhen Respondent became agitated, Keefner requested \r\n  the presence of her supervisor, Henry Noble.  Noble testified Respondent was \r\n  dressed in â€œbeach attireâ€ and was very angry, loud, and threatening.  Noble \r\n  retrieved Paigeâ€™s file for Respondentâ€™s review.  Noble testified Respondent \r\n  became â€œfuriousâ€ when he found documents on which Paige had signed her name \r\n  as â€œPaige Readâ€ instead of â€œPaige Stroud.â€\r\nAdditionally, Sheryl B. Keating, a counselor \r\n  at Coastal Empire Community Health Center on Hilton Head Island, testified that \r\n  during two or three conversations with Respondent, he became angry and threatening \r\n  when Keating refused to provide him with confidential information relating to \r\n  her counseling sessions with Paige Stroud and her mother.\r\nDespite Respondentâ€™s denial of these allegations, \r\n  the sub-panel determined that clear and convincing evidence weighed in favor \r\n  of Keefner, Noble, and Keating and that the allegations regarding Respondentâ€™s \r\n  conduct toward them were proven.\r\n\r\n Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Charges\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to respond to a Notice of \r\n  Full Investigation mailed to him on or about December 27, 2000.  The Commission \r\n  found as a mitigating factor that Respondent was living in Florida.\r\nSub-panelâ€™s findings\r\nThe sub-panel concluded Respondent breached \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.  Specifically, Respondent \r\n  violated Rule 1.1 (competence); Rule 4.4 (respect for the rights of third persons); \r\n  Rule 8.4 (misconduct), subsections (a) (violating a rule of professional conduct, \r\n  (c) (engaging in conduct involving moral turpitude), and (e) (conduct prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice.  From Rule 7 of Rule 413, Rules for Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, the sub-panel found Respondent violated Rule 7(a)(5) \r\n  (conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bring the legal \r\n  profession into disrepute or demonstrate an unfitness to practice law) and Rule \r\n  7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice in this \r\n  State).\r\nFourth Formal Charges\r\nRespondent failed to pay a court reporter \r\n  $182.90 for a transcript which he ordered involving a case filed in Dorchester \r\n  County Family Court.  The court reporter prepared the transcript, but never \r\n  mailed the transcript to Respondent after three unsuccessful attempts to procure \r\n  payment from Respondent.  Ultimately, another attorney took over representation \r\n  of Respondentâ€™s client in the case and paid for the transcript.\r\nSub-panelâ€™s findings\r\nThe sub-panel concluded Respondent breached \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.  Specifically, Respondent \r\n  violated Rule 1.1 (competence); Rule 1.3 (diligence); Rule 1.15 (safekeeping \r\n  property); Rule 1.5 (fees); Rule 4.1 (truthfulness in statements to others); \r\n  Rule 8.4 (misconduct), subsections (a) (violating a rule of professional conduct), \r\n  (c) (conduct involving moral turpitude), (d) (conduct involving dishonesty, \r\n  fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and (e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration \r\n  of justice).  From Rule 7 of Rule 413, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  the sub-panel found Respondent violated Rule 7(a)(5) (conduct tending to pollute \r\n  the administration of justice or bring the legal profession into disrepute or \r\n  demonstrate an unfitness to practice law) and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath \r\n  of office taken upon admission to practice in this State).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThis Court may make its own findings \r\n  of fact and conclusions of law, and is not bound by a panelâ€™s recommendation.  \r\n  In re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).  The authority to \r\n  discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline is given rests entirely \r\n  with this Court.  In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).  The \r\n  sanction of indefinite suspension has been imposed by this Court in similar \r\n  cases involving multiple acts of misconduct.  See e.g., In \r\n  re Gaines, 348 S.C. 208, 559 S.E.2d 577 (2002) (indefinite suspension given \r\n  attorneyâ€™s prior history of bad conduct and for, inter alia, failing \r\n  to properly maintain client escrow account and failure to make timely payment \r\n  to court reporters); In re Devine, 345 S.C. 633, 550 S.E.2d 308 (2001) \r\n  (indefinite suspension warranted for, inter alia, failing to respond \r\n  to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and misappropriation of client funds); \r\n  In re Graab, 334 S.C. 633, 515 S.E.2d 93 (1999) (accepting Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent to indefinitely suspend attorney for, inter alia, \r\n  failing to keep complete records of trust account funds, failure to provide \r\n  competent representation, failure to make truthful statements to others, failure \r\n  to respond to Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and failure to respect the rights \r\n  of others). \r\nRespondentâ€™s numerous incidences of misconduct, \r\n  including his misappropriation of approximately $20,000 of trust account funds, \r\n  his failure to honor his tax obligations, his repeated failure to respond to \r\n  the disciplinary charges against him, and his unprofessional behavior, justify \r\n  an indefinite suspension.  Furthermore, we take exception to the sub-panelâ€™s \r\n  finding that Respondent did not commit misconduct in failing to file a notice \r\n  of appeal in the Leroy Ferrell matter. Accordingly, we find a violation of the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.  The only appropriate \r\n  course of action would have been to file an appeal on Mr. Ferrellâ€™s behalf.  \r\n  We hold Respondent acted incompetently in failing to file the notice of appeal \r\n  in violation of Rule 1.1.\r\nAdditionally, we take note \r\n  Respondent has previously received a public admonition from this Court, dated \r\n  May 1, 2001.  Respondent was admonished for his aggressive representation and \r\n  unprofessional behavior, which caused avoidable conflicts.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe record is unclear of the \r\n  total restitution owed to Wayne Howard.  Respondent shall effectuate within \r\n  sixty days of the date of this opinion an agreement with Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  to implement a payment plan to ensure the timely and prompt payment of restitution \r\n  to Wayne Howard and to any other parties to whom monies are owed.   Upon reaching \r\n  the agreement, the parties shall submit the plan to this Court, indicating all \r\n  monies owed and to whom.  With any application for reinstatement, Respondent \r\n  must provide satisfactory evidence he has complied with the payment plan and \r\n  paid the costs of the Commissionâ€™s proceedings in the amount of $2,164.37.  \r\n  Additionally, Respondent must show he has received instruction in law office \r\n  management, with emphasis on trust account management and received counseling \r\n  in appropriate conduct towards clients and others.  Within fifteen days of the \r\n  date of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court \r\n  showing compliance with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender \r\n  his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice James \r\n  R.

Fred Kuhn, Jr., of Moss &amp; Kuhn P.A., of Beaufort, for \r\n  Petitioner.\r\nPhilip Fairbanks and Kathy D. Lindsay, both of Fairbanks &amp; Lindsay P.A., \r\n  of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  This Court granted certiorari \r\n  to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ unpublished opinion (1) affirming the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s decision to award each plaintiff minimum statutory damages under Uniform \r\n  Commercial Code (â€œUCCâ€ or â€œCodeâ€) Â§ 36-9-507(1) (Supp. 2000); and (2) reversing \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s finding that the UCC and the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices \r\n  Act (â€œSCUTPAâ€) causes of action were factually inconsistent.  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn March 27, 1997, Randolph and Valerie Singleton \r\n  (Singletons) decided to purchase a used 1993 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck \r\n  from Stokes Motors (Stokes) in Beaufort, South Carolina.  To carry out the transaction, \r\n  they signed a note and purchase money security agreement (sales contract).  \r\n  As part of the purchase price, the Singletons were to trade-in their Dodge Dakota \r\n  and make a cash down payment of $1600.  The sales contract did not indicate \r\n  that the sale was contingent upon credit approval.  \r\nThat same day, the Singletons signed a second document, \r\n  a bailment agreement, which unlike the sales contract, provided that they were \r\n  accepting the Silverado subject to credit approval.  If their credit was not \r\n  approved, the Singletons were required, under the terms of the bailment agreement, \r\n  to return the Silverado to Stokes â€œimmediately upon notice or verbal communication.â€  \r\n\r\nAfter signing both documents, the Singletons drove \r\n  off the lot in the Silverado, having given Stokes the Dakota trade-in and only \r\n  $800 of the $1600 required cash down payment.\r\nNearly three weeks later, on April 16, 1997, the \r\n  Singletons returned to Stokes because Stokes claimed that the loan paperwork \r\n  could not be completed due to Mr. Singletonâ€™s failure to produce proof of income.  \r\n  Mrs. Singleton explained that her husband had lost his job but that he would \r\n  soon be able to produce proof of income from his new job.  The Singletons also \r\n  admitted that they could not afford to pay the remaining $800 of the down payment.  \r\n  The salesperson told the Singletons to â€œforget about it,â€ and they signed an \r\n  entirely new sales contract.  \r\nThe new sales contract, like the initial sales \r\n  contract, reflected that the Dodge Dakota had been traded in, but it showed \r\n  $800 as the required cash down payment.  And even though the Singletons had \r\n  yet to produce Mr. Singletonâ€™s proof of income, Stokes told them that their \r\n  credit had been approved.  Finally, Stokes never asked the Singletons to sign \r\n  another bailment agreement during this second meeting.  So after signing the \r\n  new sales contract and paying nothing further in cash, the Singletons were permitted \r\n  to drive away in the Silverado.         \r\nUltimately, Stokes could not verify Mr. Singletonâ€™s \r\n  employment.  In addition, contrary to Stokesâ€™s statements at the second meeting, \r\n  the Singletonsâ€™ credit was never approved.  Therefore, Stokes repossessed the \r\n  Silverado from the Singleton home before the first payment on the truck was \r\n  even due.      \r\nAfter the Silverado was repossessed, Mrs. Singleton \r\n  went to Stokes to demand the return of the $800 down payment and the Dakota \r\n  trade-in.  Stokes refused to return either, claiming that it had already spent \r\n  approximately $800 repairing the trade-in and had already paid off the Singletonsâ€™ \r\n  existing loan on the Dakota.  For the return of the Dakota, Stokes told the \r\n  Singletons that they would need to secure another loan.  But because they could \r\n  not secure a loan, the Singletons were left without a vehicle and without their \r\n  $800.         \r\nStokes subsequently resold the Silverado to another \r\n  customer without notifying the Singletons.  And eventually, Stokes sold the \r\n  Dakota trade-in. [1]             \r\nThe Singletons filed separate, identical complaints, \r\n  alleging causes of action based on the UCC and the SCUTPA. [2]   The UCC claim stemmed from Stokesâ€™s failure to notify the \r\n  Singletons in writing that Stokes intended to sell the repossessed Silverado.  \r\n  Because the Singletons did not receive such notice, they claimed that they were \r\n  entitled to collect the minimum statutory penalty provided under the UCC.  The \r\n  SCUPTA claim stemmed from Stokesâ€™s (1) failure to return the $800 cash down \r\n  payment and the Dodge Dakota and (2) failure to inform the Singletons that the \r\n  Silverado was being resold.         \r\nThe trial judge initially found for the Singletons on both \r\n  claims.  As to the UCC claim, the judge found that the Singletons were entitled \r\n  to notice of Stokesâ€™s disposition of the Silverado.  Because they did not receive \r\n  such notice, the judge awarded Mr. and Mrs. Singleton $10,881 each as directed \r\n  by the UCC minimum statutory penalty provision.  As to the SCUTPA claim, the \r\n  judge found that Stokesâ€™s refusal to return the Dakota and the $800 cash constituted \r\n  a violation of the act.  Therefore, the judge awarded the Singletons $8,029 \r\n  in actual damages (the $800 cash deposit plus the net value of the Dodge Dakota), \r\n  then trebled the award for a total of $24,087.           \r\nAfter the order was issued, Stokes filed a motion to reconsider, \r\n  arguing that the UCC and the SCUTPA causes of action were factually inconsistent.  \r\n  In other words, Stokes argued that the facts required to prove one cause of \r\n  action necessarily negated the facts necessary to prove the other cause of action.  \r\n  The trial judge agreed with Stokes and issued an order reducing the award in \r\n  the initial judgment.            \r\nIn this second order, the trial judge reasoned that for the \r\n  SCUTPA cause of action to succeed, he must find that the sale of the Silverado \r\n  to the Singletons was never finalized.  If the sale were final, then the Dakota \r\n  trade-in and the $800 cash down payment belonged to Stokes, and Stokes could \r\n  dispose of either as it wished.  It was impossible, the judge reasoned, for \r\n  Stokes to violate SCUTPA for refusing to return its own property.          \r\nAt the same time, for the UCC claim to survive, a sale must \r\n  have occurred.  And because the judge found that a sale had taken place, the \r\n  Singletonsâ€™ no longer had a valid SCUTPA claim.  Therefore, the trial judge \r\n  found that the UCC and the SCUTPA claims were factually inconsistent, and he \r\n  reduced the damages to reflect the UCC award only.         \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s award to \r\n  both Singletons for the UCC violation but reversed the trial courtâ€™s finding \r\n  that the UCC and SCUTPA causes of action were factually inconsistent.  The court \r\n  found that the UCC and SCUTPA claims were separate and distinct, permitting \r\n  the Singletons to recover under both.\r\nThis Court granted certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  decision and the following issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial judgeâ€™s decision to award \r\n  the minimum statutory penalty under the UCC to both Mr. and Mrs. Singleton?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial judgeâ€™s ruling that the \r\n  UCC and SCUTPA claims were factually inconsistent?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.       UCC Award to Both Singletons\r\nStokes argues that the Court of Appeals erred in \r\n  affirming the trial judgeâ€™s decision to award UCC damages to both Mr. and Mrs. \r\n  Singleton.  We disagree.\r\nThe UCC outlines the rights, remedies, and duties \r\n  of parties to secured transactions.  In particular, Article 9, Part 5, \r\n  [3]  prescribes the procedures that a secured party must follow when a debtor \r\n  defaults under a security agreement.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-501 - 36-9-607 (Supp. \r\n  2000).  Upon default, a secured party may re-sell the collateral.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 36-9-504(1) (Supp. 2000).  In most circumstances, a debtor is entitled \r\n  to reasonable notification of the time and place of sale or other intended disposition \r\n  of repossessed collateral is to be made.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-504(3) (Supp. \r\n  2000).  [4]   If no such notice is given, \r\n  the debtor has a statutory right to recover.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-507(1) (Supp. \r\n  2000).\r\nThis right to recover and \r\n  the formula used to calculate the amount of recovery are outlined in the Code \r\n  as follows:  \r\n\r\nIf the disposition has occurred the debtor or any person \r\n  entitled to notification or whose security interest has been made known to the \r\n  secured party prior to the disposition has a right to recover from \r\n  the secured party any loss caused by a failure to comply with the provisions \r\n  of this part.  If the collateral is consumer goods, the debtor has a \r\n  right to recover in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge \r\n  plus ten percent of the principal amount of the debt or the time price differential \r\n  plus ten percent of the cash price.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-507(1) (Supp. \r\n  2000) (emphasis added).    \r\nFurther, the Code defines â€œdebtorâ€ as â€œthe person \r\n  who owes payment or other performance of the obligation secured, whether or \r\n  not he owns or has rights in the collateral . . . .â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-105(d) \r\n  (Supp. 2000).    \r\nIn the present case, Stokes concedes that it violated \r\n  the Codeâ€™s notice requirement by failing to notify the Singletons that it was \r\n  re-selling the Silverado.  Stokes also concedes that the Singletons were entitled \r\n  to recover the minimum statutory damages according to the formula set forth \r\n  in section 36-9-507(1) above.  But what Stokes argues is that both Singletons \r\n  should not have been able to recover for violations concerning one secured \r\n  transaction.    \r\nConsequently, the issue before this Court is whether \r\n  the term â€œdebtorâ€ includes each debtor in a secured transaction, such \r\n  that both Mr. and Mrs. Singleton were entitled, individually, to recover damages \r\n  under the Code.  \r\nThe statutory language of section 36-9-507(1) (Supp. \r\n  2000), on its face, suggests that as debtors, both Singletons were entitled \r\n  to recover.  The statute plainly states that â€œthe debtor or anyoneâ€ who is entitled \r\n  to notice, or whose security interest the secured party knows of, â€œhas a right \r\n  to recover.â€  Because both Mr. and Mrs. Singleton signed the sales contract \r\n  and were designated as â€œpurchaser-debtors,â€ both were entitled to notice \r\n  and therefore both were entitled to recover under the Code.\r\nAdditionally, this Court has held that co-obligators \r\n  or guarantors to a loan constitute â€œdebtorsâ€ for purposes of recovery.  Crane \r\n  v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Serv., Inc., 313 S.C. 70, 437 S.E.2d 50 (1993).  Therefore, \r\n  the Court found that the Codeâ€™s penalty provision applied â€œto co-obligators \r\n  of consumer goods security agreements.â€  Id. at 74, 437 S.E.2d at 53.  \r\n  Further, the Court described the rationale behind the penalty provision as follows:\r\n\r\nthe statutory penalty is evidence of the legislatureâ€™s recognition \r\n  that the small amount of compensatory damages that may be proven in a consumer \r\n  goods repossession and sale would be insufficient to ensure creditor compliance \r\n  with the Codeâ€™s provisions.      \r\n\r\nId. at 74-75, 437 S.E.2d at 53 (citation \r\n  omitted).\r\nAlso in Crane, the Court addressed the creditorâ€™s \r\n  concern that because an unlimited number of co-obligators could be liable on \r\n  a contract, the creditorâ€™s liability could be significant if there were multiple \r\n  guarantors.  Id. The Courtâ€™s response to this concern was that â€œthe number \r\n  of guarantors is within the creditorâ€™s control.â€  Id.  This response \r\n  implies that creditors cannot expect to receive the benefit of having multiple \r\n  guarantors without also bearing the risk of having multiple claimants.  Should \r\n  there be a default, the creditor could recover from any single guarantor.  Likewise, \r\n  if the creditor violated the Code, any or all guarantors could sue the creditor.  \r\n  Therefore, Crane stands for the proposition that multiple guarantors \r\n  to one secured transaction are entitled to recover. [5] \r\nIn the present case, both Mr. and Mrs. Singleton \r\n  signed the sales contract, making each of them a â€œpurchaser-debtorâ€ and each \r\n  jointly and severally liable for the debt.  If the Singletons had secured a \r\n  loan and subsequently defaulted, Stokes could have sought payment from either \r\n  Mr. or Mrs. Singleton.  In other words, Stokes benefited from having two people, \r\n  instead of one, fully liable for the debt.  When Stokes failed to notify the \r\n  Singletons that the Silverado was to be sold, it became subject to claims from \r\n  either Singleton or both.  Both parties filed complaints because both parties \r\n  were entitled to notice, and therefore, we hold that both parties were \r\n  entitled to minimum statutory damages.      \r\nWe recognize that the outcome \r\n  in this case would be different if the underlying action were brought today.  \r\n  In July 2001, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted revised Article 9, \r\n  which included substantial changes, including an entirely new section entitled, \r\n  â€œNonliability and limitation on liability of secured party; liability of secondary \r\n  obligor.â€  This new section contains a provision which states â€œ[a] secured party \r\n  is not liable under Section 36-9-625(c)(2) more than once with respect to any \r\n  one secured obligation.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-628(e) (2003).  \r\nThe South Carolina Reporterâ€™s Comment to section \r\n  36-9-628(e) explains that while all debtors and guarantors are entitled to bring \r\n  claims for minimum damages, the secured partyâ€™s aggregate liability is limited \r\n  to a single recovery.  Comment to S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 36-9-628 (Supp. 2001).  \r\n  Accordingly, the Comment states, this new section effectively overrules the \r\n  Crane holding with respect to recovery of statutory minimum damages.  \r\n  Id.    \r\nBut the law in effect at the time the cause of \r\n  action accrued controls the partiesâ€™ legal relationships and rights.  Stephens \r\n  v. Draffin, 327 S.C. 1, 5, 488 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1997).  In addition, legislative \r\n  intent is paramount in determining whether a statute has a prospective or retroactive \r\n  application.  Jenkins v. Meares, 302 S.C. 142, 146, 394 S.E.2d 317, 319 \r\n  (1990) (citation omitted).        \r\nRevised Article 9 was not effective until July \r\n  1, 2001, nearly four years after the Singletons sued.  Moreover, revised Article \r\n  9 clearly states that â€œ[t]his act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding \r\n  commenced before this act takes effect.â€  S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 36-9-702 (Supp. \r\n  2001).  Because the underlying lawsuit arose before July 2001, revised Article \r\n  9 does not apply in the instant case.   \r\nTherefore, given the plain meaning of S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 36-9-507(1) (Supp. 2000) and this Courtâ€™s ruling in Crane, we \r\n  hold that Mr. and Mrs. Singleton were entitled, individually, to recover the \r\n  minimum statutory penalty from Stokes.\r\nII.      Factual Inconsistency/UCC and SCUTPA Claims\r\nStokes argues that the Court of Appeals erred in \r\n  reversing the trial judgeâ€™s ruling that the UCC and the SCUTPA causes of action \r\n  were factually inconsistent.  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act declares \r\n  unfair or deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce unlawful.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (2002).  The Act provides that:\r\n\r\n[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or \r\n  property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another \r\n  person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice â€¦  may bring an action \r\n  â€¦ to recover actual damages.  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (2002).  Plaintiffs \r\n  must allege and prove that the defendantâ€™s actions adversely affected the public \r\n  interest.  Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co., Inc. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, \r\n  473 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996) (citations omitted).  An impact on the public interest \r\n  may be shown if the acts or practices have the potential for repetition.  Crary \r\n  v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 387, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998) (citation omitted).  \r\n  The potential for repetition may be shown in either of two ways: (1) by showing \r\n  the same kind of actions occurred in the past, thus making it likely they will \r\n  continue to occur absent deterrence; or (2) by showing the companyâ€™s procedures \r\n  created a potential for repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts.  Id. \r\n  at 388, 496 S.E.2d at 23.  (citation omitted).           \r\nInitially, the trial judge found that Stokes violated \r\n  SCUTPA by knowingly and willfully retaining the cash down payment and the Dakota \r\n  trade-in.  The judge also found that Stokesâ€™s actions were part of its standard \r\n  business practices, and accordingly, were capable of repetition and impacted \r\n  the public interest.           \r\nBut in a subsequent order, the trial judge dismissed \r\n  the SCUTPA claim, finding that the UCC and SCUTPA claims were factually inconsistent.  \r\n  The judge agreed with Stokesâ€™s argument that once Stokes sold the Silverado \r\n  to the Singletons, Stokes became the rightful owner of the $800 cash down payment \r\n  and the Dakota trade-in.  Therefore, Stokes could not have violated the SCUTPA \r\n  for retaining its own property.      \r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed \r\n  the lower court and found that the UCC and the SCUTPA claims were not factually \r\n  inconsistent because the allegations concerning Stokesâ€™s unfair trade practices \r\n  were separate and distinct from the UCC claim.  As to the SCUTPA claim, the \r\n  court pointed to fact that (1) Stokes repossessed the Silverado before payments \r\n  became due, and (2) Stokes profited from reselling the Silverado for an amount \r\n  in excess of the Singletonsâ€™ purchase price and from retaining the Singletonsâ€™ \r\n  down payment, including the trade-in vehicle.  The UCC claim, however, was based \r\n  on a statutory provision requiring notice.     \r\nWe agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision that \r\n  the UCC and SCUPTA claims are not factually inconsistent.  In addition to the \r\n  facts highlighted by the Court of Appeals, we base our decision on additional \r\n  wrongdoing by Stokes, namely (1) having customers sign both an unconditional \r\n  sales contract and a conditional bailment agreement; and (2) misleading customers \r\n  to believe that their credit has been approved.  The facts necessary to demonstrate \r\n  both of these practices do not negate the facts necessary to make the UCC claim, \r\n  since such wrongdoing occurred before the Silverado sale was finalized. \r\n  Moreover, we hold that these practices, by themselves, constitute SCUPTA violations.           \r\n\r\nFirst, Stokesâ€™s practice of having customers sign two contradictory \r\n  documentsâ€”an unconditional sales contract and a conditional bailment agreementâ€”is \r\n  an essential part of conducting what is commonly referred to as a â€œyo-yoâ€ sale.  \r\n  The â€œyo-yoâ€ or â€œspot-deliveryâ€ sale typically proceeds in the following way:\r\n\r\nThe consumer believes a vehicleâ€™s installment or sale is \r\n  final and the dealer gives the consumer possession of the car â€œon the spot.â€ \r\n  The dealer later tells the consumer to return the car because the financing \r\n  has fallen through.  If the consumer does not return the vehicle or agree to \r\n  rewrite the transaction on less favorable terms, the dealer repossesses the \r\n  vehicle.\r\n\r\nNational Consumer Law Center, Unfair and Deceptive \r\n  Acts and Practices 316 (5th ed. 2001).           \r\nYo-yo sales are unlawful in at least seven states \r\n  and several other states have issued regulations and administrative interpretations \r\n  to car dealers on the subject.  Id. at 317.  Such transactions are fundamentally \r\n  unfair because they give all of the power to the dealer, and none to the customer:\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, once the customer drives the car off the \r\n  lot, the consumer is locked into the sale.  The dealer does not want the consumer \r\n  to think about the deal overnightâ€”it wants the deal closed on the spot while \r\n  the consumer has just undergone hours of sales pressure.\r\nOn the other hand, the dealer wants to retain its options \r\n  when the consumer drives off the lot with the car.  It does not want to be rushed \r\n  into a hasty deal.  It wants time for its personnel to review the profit margin, \r\n  the consumerâ€™s credit rating, and the chances of selling the vehicle to someone \r\n  else.  It wants time to reflect on whether it can squeeze more out of the consumer \r\n  or whether it is better off selling the vehicle to someone else.\r\nUsually, the dealer will want to hide the one-sided nature \r\n  of the transaction.  It does not want consumers to think that they can get out \r\n  of a deal just because the dealer can.  So the dealer will not disclose that \r\n  the deal, from the dealerâ€™s point of view, is not final.\r\n\r\nId. at 317.\r\nThe manner in which Stokes handled the Singleton \r\n  transaction mirrored a yo-yo sale.  During the first round of negotiations, \r\n  the Singletons were led to believe that the sale was final and that the Silverado \r\n  was theirs.  At the same time, Stokes retained the option to enforce the bailment \r\n  agreementâ€”which it didâ€”compelling the Singletons to return to the lot. During \r\n  this second visit, Stokes told the Singletons that their credit had been approved, \r\n  renegotiated the sales contract, and allowed the Singletons to drive away in \r\n  the Silverado once again, believing it was theirs.  Yet before the first payment \r\n  became due, Stokes repossessed the truck.  Apparently the financing had not \r\n  been approved after all.    \r\nStokesâ€™s deception concerning credit approval and \r\n  the practice of having customers sign both an unconditional sales contract and \r\n  a conditional bailment agreement are patently unfair and deceptive acts.  Because \r\n  Stokes admitted that it was a standard business practice to handle deals in \r\n  this manner, we find that such acts were capable of repetition, having the requisite \r\n  impact on the public interest.  Therefore, we hold that (1) outright deception \r\n  concerning credit approval and (2) the practice of having customers sign both \r\n  an unconditional sales contract and a conditional bailment agreement constitute \r\n  SCUTPA violations.   \r\nStokes, and other car dealerships, \r\n  could easily cure the unfairness of such practices by (1) including language \r\n  in the sales agreement that the sale is conditional upon the buyer obtaining \r\n  financing and (2) telling customers the truth about their credit. \r\nFinally, given that these instances of wrongdoing \r\n  are not dependent on the facts required to establish the UCC violation, we hold \r\n  that the SCUTPA and the UCC claims are not factually inconsistent, entitling \r\n  the Singletons to bring claims under both statutes.  \r\nConclusion\r\nIn sum, we find that both debtors were entitled \r\n  minimum statutory damages under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-507(1) (Supp. 2000).  Additionally, \r\n  we deem (1) the practice of having customers sign both an unconditional sales \r\n  contract and a conditional bailment agreement and (2) outright deception regarding \r\n  credit approval SCUTPA violations.  Finally, because the facts necessary to \r\n  establish the SCUTPA violation were not inconsistent with the facts required \r\n  to establish the UCC violation, we hold that the Singletons could bring claims \r\n  under both statutes.  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice James R. Barber, III., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Stokes realized a substantial profit on both the re-sale of the Silverado \r\n    and the sale of the Dakota trade-in.  Stokes was able to re-sell the Silverado \r\n    for $2,595 more than the amount due under the Singleton contract.  And the \r\n    Dakota trade-in was sold for a cash price of $14,000, giving Stokes a $7,326 \r\n    profit (after Stokes made repairs and paid off the lien).  Therefore, Stokes \r\n    realized a profit of $9,921 by conducting the Singleton transaction in the \r\n    manner that it did.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  By the partiesâ€™ consent, the cases were consolidated before trial.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Unless otherwise stated, the Code sections refer to the former \r\n    Article 9, the law applicable at the time the underlying lawsuit was filed.  \r\n    In July 2001, Article 9 was significantly revised, and we address the applicable \r\n    revisions when appropriate.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Reasonable notification may not be required when the â€œcollateral \r\n    is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily \r\n    sold on a recognized marketâ€ or when the debtor has signed, after default, \r\n    â€œa statement renouncing or modifying his right to notification of sale.â€  \r\n    S.C.

Victor Pyle, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25805\r\nHeard February 18, 2004 - Filed April \r\n  19, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCharles E. Carpenter, Jr., and S. Elizabeth Brosnan, all \r\n  of Richardson, Plowden, Carpenter &amp; Robinson, P.A., of Columbia; and William \r\n  D. Marvin and Steven L. Smith, both of Kessler, Cohen &amp; Roth, P.C., of Philadelphia, \r\n  Pennsylvania, for petitioner.\r\nJohn L. Choate and Allan Levin, both of Cozen Oâ€™Connor, \r\n  of Atlanta, Georgia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  Petitioner (Contractor) brought this action on behalf \r\n  of its insurer, Crum &amp; Forster (Insurer), \r\n  [1]  asserting Insurerâ€™s right to be subrogated to Contractorâ€™s claim against \r\n  respondent (Subcontractor) for fire damage to a construction site.  Subcontractor \r\n  asserted as a defense the waiver of subrogation clause found in its contract \r\n  with Contractor.  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  unpublished opinion holding the waiver of subrogation clause valid.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSubcontractorâ€™s employee/sub-subcontractor allegedly caused the fire by negligent \r\n  soldering.  For purposes of this appeal, Subcontractorâ€™s liability is assumed.  \r\n  Insurer paid Contractor $935,000 [2]  under its property loss policy.  \r\n  The trial judge granted Subcontractor a directed verdict based on the waiver \r\n  of subrogation clause and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.\r\n         Are Schedules A and B of the contract controlling \r\n  over other form provisions of the contract?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2.&nbsp;\r\n         Is the contract ambiguous? \r\n      \r\n      \r\n         3.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Is the waiver of subrogation clause ambiguous \r\n  and against public policy?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;DISCUSSION\r\n1.  \r\n  Validity of form provisions\r\nIn the course of negotiating the \r\n  contract with Contractor, Subcontractor submitted a standard form contract developed \r\n  by the American Institute of Architects, hereinafter referred to as the â€œAIA \r\n  form.â€  This form contains the waiver of subrogation provision at issue.  In \r\n  response, Contractor submitted Schedule A and Schedule B as additional contract \r\n  terms.  Subcontractor made some handwritten changes to these Schedules before \r\n  agreeing.  The AIA form and Schedules A and B together became the agreement \r\n  between the parties.\r\nContractor argues that Schedules A and B of the contract control over the AIA \r\n  form which includes the waiver of subrogation clause.  Contractor relies on \r\n  provisions in these Schedules that hold Subcontractor liable for damage caused \r\n  by faulty workmanship and argues these provisions invalidate the waiver of subrogation \r\n  clause. [3] \r\nThe Court of Appeals found the provisions of the Schedules do not \r\n  override the provisions of the AIA form because these Schedules are themselves \r\n  essentially boilerplate.  We agree.  Michael Rodgers, Contractorâ€™s vice-president, \r\n  testified Schedules A and B were Contractorâ€™s â€œstandardâ€ agreement form used \r\n  for subcontracting.  Contractor is not relying on any of the handwritten changes \r\n  made to these Schedules during the partiesâ€™ negotiations but points to provisions \r\n  included in the standard form part of the Schedules.  These standard form provisions \r\n  do not control as a matter of law simply because they are not industry-wide \r\n  forms like the AIA form.  Cf. Riverside Bldg. Supply, Inc. v. Fed. \r\n  Emergency Management Agency, 723 F.2d 1159 (4th Cir. 1983) (typewritten \r\n  terms inserted in preprinted form reflect more exactly the agreement of the \r\n  parties). \r\nIn any event, as discussed \r\n  below, the waiver of subrogation clause found in the AIA form and the liability \r\n  provisions of Schedules A and B are not inconsistent.  Even if the provisions \r\n  of the Schedules were to be given more weight, they would not invalidate the \r\n  subrogation clause.  \r\n2.  Whether the \r\n  contract as a whole is ambiguous\r\nContractor contends the provisions of Schedules A and B\r\nconflict with the waiver of subrogation \r\n  clause rendering the contract ambiguous.  It argues because the contract is \r\n  ambiguous, its terms must be determined by the fact-finder and a directed verdict \r\n  was inappropriate.  The Court of Appeals found the contract is not ambiguous \r\n  and concluded the waiver of subrogation clause is enforceable.  We agree.  \r\nThe relevant provisions \r\n  of the contract are as follows.  Paragraph 13.5 of the AIA form provides:\r\n\r\n  13.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWaivers of Subrogation.  \r\n  The Contractor and Subcontractor waive all rights against (1) each other . . \r\n  . for damages caused by fire . . . to the extent covered by property insurance \r\n  . . . applicable to the Work. . . .  The policies shall provide such waivers \r\n  of subrogation by endorsement or otherwise.  A waiver of subrogation shall be \r\n  effective as to a person or entity even though that person or entity would otherwise \r\n  have a duty of indemnification, contractual or otherwise, did not pay the insurance \r\n  premium directly or indirectly, and whether or not the person or entity had \r\n  an insurable interest in the property damaged.\r\n\r\nSchedule A includes the following provisions:\r\n\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBCONTRACTOR acknowledges and agrees that it has \r\n  the sole responsibility for compliance with all of the requirements of the Occupational \r\n  Safety and Health Act of 1970 and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless CONTRACTOR \r\n  against any legal liability or loss which CONTRACTOR may incur due to SUBCONTRACTORâ€™s \r\n  failure to comply with the above referenced Act.\r\n  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBCONTRACTOR will be liable \r\n  for any actions or damages caused by its material suppliers and sub-subcontractors.  \r\n  SUBCONTRACTOR will be responsible for damages caused by SUBCONTRACTOR, its suppliers \r\n  or sub-subcontractors to the work.\r\n  32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBCONTRACTOR shall be held \r\n  responsible for all damages to the building or the work of others resulting \r\n  from his negligence.\r\n  33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBCONTRACTOR is to maintain \r\n  all amounts of insurance listed in Specifications for the duration of the project.  \r\n  If no requirement is listed in Specifications, SUBCONTRACTOR is to maintain \r\n  the amounts of insurance required by law for the State in which the work is \r\n  being performed.\r\n\r\nSchedule B includes the following:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Before work commences, the SUBCONTRACTOR \r\n  shall submit an original insurance certificate indicating General Liability \r\n  Coverage and Limits and Workerâ€™s Compensation Coverage. . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         5.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         SUBCONTRACTOR shall be held responsible \r\n  for all damages to property or the Work of others resulting from his/her Work, \r\n  including consequential damages resulting therefrom.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Where damages to buildings and/or \r\n  furnishing occur due to faulty Workmanship or faulty materials, said damages \r\n  will be backcharged to the SUBCONTRACTOR including any consequential damages \r\n  resulting therefrom.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n Contractor contends \r\n  that Subcontractorâ€™s agreement to be â€œheld responsibleâ€ for damages and to carry \r\n  liability insurance conflict with the waiver of subrogation clause.  We find \r\n  no conflict.  Reading the contract as a whole, the waiver of subrogation clause \r\n  provides that subrogation is waived to the extent damages are covered by \r\n  property insurance.  Under the provisions of Schedules A and B, Subcontractor \r\n  remains liable for any excess damages not covered by property insurance.  The \r\n  requirement that Subcontractor carry liability insurance would apply to excess \r\n  damages and other damages not covered by property insurance.\r\nSince there is no ambiguity, \r\n  the trial court properly directed a verdict based on the waiver of subrogation \r\n  clause.\r\n3.  The waiver of subrogation clause\r\nContractor contends the waiver \r\n  of subrogation clause is itself ambiguous and should not be enforced.  We disagree.\r\nThe relevant part of \r\n  the waiver of subrogation clause provides as follows:\r\n\r\nA waiver of subrogation shall be effective as to a person or entity even though \r\n  that person or entity would otherwise have a duty of indemnification, \r\n  contractual or otherwise, did not pay the insurance premium directly or indirectly, \r\n  and whether or not the person or entity had an insurable interest in the property \r\n  damaged.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  The Court of \r\n  Appeals interpreted this language as consistent with the liability language \r\n  of Schedules A and B.  Contractor contends to the contrary that the â€œotherwiseâ€ \r\n  provision renders the waiver confusing and unenforceable.\r\nWe find no internal \r\n  conflict in the clause when read with another provision of the AIA form which \r\n  specifically addresses indemnification:\r\n\r\n4.5     INDEMNIFICATION\r\n  4.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the fullest extent permitted by law, the \r\n  Subcontractor shall indemnify . . . Contractor . . . from and against losses \r\n  . . . arising out of or resulting from performance of the Subcontractorâ€™s Work \r\n  . . . attributable to . . . destruction of tangible property (other than the \r\n  Work itself). . . .\r\n\r\n(parentheses in original).  The \r\n  â€œotherwiseâ€ language included in the waiver of subrogation refers back to this \r\n  provision regarding indemnification for damage to property other than the \r\n  Work itself.  In other words, under the terms of the AIA form, even though \r\n  Subcontractor must fully indemnify Contractor for damage to the property of \r\n  others, Contractor waives subrogation for damage to the construction site \r\n  to the extent covered by property insurance.  There is no conflict within the \r\n  waiver of subrogation clause.\r\nContractor further contends \r\n  it is against public policy to enforce the waiver of subrogation clause because \r\n  it unconscionably relieves Subcontractor of liability for its negligence.  As \r\n  noted by the Court of Appeals, other courts have upheld waiver of subrogation \r\n  clauses because they apply only to property loss, they waive subrogation only \r\n  to the extent covered by first party insurance, and they merely give effect \r\n  to the partiesâ€™ agreement to allocate risk.  See IRMA v. Oâ€™Donnell, \r\n  Wicklund, Pigozzi &amp; Peterson Architects, Inc., 692 N.E.2d 739 (Ill. \r\n  App. 1998); Viacom Internatâ€™l, Inc. v. Midtown Realty Co., 193 A.D.2d \r\n  45 (N.Y. 1993).

(SRRI).  Respondent, South Carolina \r\n  Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), initially issued and \r\n  later withdrew Solid Waste Landfill Permit No. 362624-1601 (the â€œpermitâ€), thereby \r\n  preventing SRRIâ€™s construction and operation of an industrial waste landfill \r\n  in the Helena Community of Newberry County.  The Involved Citizens of the Helena \r\n  Community and others (Citizens), are also respondents in this proceeding. \r\nFACTS \r\nBefore SRRI applied for an industrial waste landfill permit, \r\n  SRRI submitted a written request to the Newberry County Council for a determination \r\n  the proposed landfill was consistent with the Newberry County Solid Waste Management \r\n  Plan (the Plan).  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(F) (2002), [1]  an applicantâ€™s proposed facility must be consistent \r\n  with local land use ordinances.  On August 17, 1995, the Newberry County Council \r\n  determined that the proposed landfill was consistent with the Plan and issued \r\n  a letter of consistency (LOC) to SRRI.&nbsp; \r\nAfter receiving the LOC, SRRI began planning its proposed \r\n  facility.  During September and October 1995, SRRI performed a hydrogeologic \r\n  characterization of the site at DHECâ€™s request.  In December 1995, SRRI submitted \r\n  its permit application to DHECâ€™s Bureau of Solid and Hazardous Waste.  In 1996, \r\n  SRRI conducted a wetlands delineation and in September of that year SRRI received \r\n  a letter authorizing fill of the wetland.  In June 1997, SRRI undertook another \r\n  wetlands delineation after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers changed the threshold \r\n  for issuance of a permit to fill the wetlands.  As a result of the 1997 delineation, \r\n  SRRI decided to eliminate the portion of the landfill that would occupy wetland \r\n  areas and voluntarily established a 200-foot buffer around the wetland.  \r\nDuring the 1997 legislative session, the General Assembly \r\n  enacted Act No. 100, 1997 S.C. Acts 487 (Act 100), which prevents a commercial \r\n  industrial solid waste landfill from being constructed within 1,000 feet of \r\n  a residence.  Act 100 does not define â€œresidence.â€\r\nFollowing the enactment of Act 100, Bill and Eliza Parr, \r\n  named respondents in this action, placed a mobile home on their property, which \r\n  is adjacent to SRRIâ€™s landfill site.  SRRI redesigned the landfill to establish \r\n  the 1,000-foot buffer from the mobile home prior to making a final permit decision.\r\nAfter conducting a thorough analysis of the facility, DHEC \r\n  issued the permit on September 5, 1997.   DHEC applied the requirements of 25 \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 61-66 (1976) relating to Industrial Waste Landfills.  One \r\n  day prior to DHEC issuing SRRI its permit, a recreational camper was moved onto \r\n  another area of the Parr property.  DHEC did not require SRRI provide a 1,000-foot \r\n  buffer from the camper.\r\nCitizens requested a contested case hearing to challenge \r\n  the issuance of the permit.  SRRI also appealed DHECâ€™s requirement that SRRI \r\n  establish a 1,000-foot buffer to the mobile home.  After the conclusion of the \r\n  hearing, but before the issuance of a written order by the Administrative Law \r\n  Judge (ALJ), the Newberry County Council revoked its LOC.   In June 1998, DHEC \r\n  and Citizens filed separate motions requesting the ALJ re-open the record to \r\n  consider additional evidence on the Countyâ€™s revocation.  By order dated January \r\n  4, 1999, the ALJ concluded the revocation of the LOC precluded issuance of the \r\n  permit.  \r\nSRRI sought review of the ALJ order and the Board of the \r\n  South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control affirmed the ALJ \r\n  decision in its order dated June 29, 1999.  SRRI petitioned for judicial review \r\n  of the Boardâ€™s order.  The circuit court upheld the ALJ decision, but modified \r\n  the holdings.  The court concluded (1) Act 100 did not apply to a recreational \r\n  camper placed on the property and (2) the provision of the Newberry County Solid \r\n  Waste Management Act relied upon by the ALJ did not support the finding.  However, \r\n  the court concluded Section 10.2 of the Plan supported the ALJâ€™s finding.  On \r\n  appeal, SRRI requests this Court hold the permit be issued and effective.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the circuit court err in holding that the revocation of the consistency \r\n  determination compelled denial of the permit?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the circuit court properly conclude the proposed facility is inconsistent \r\n  with Newberry Countyâ€™s plan?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn environmental permitting cases, the ALJ presides as the \r\n  finder of fact.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Supp. 2003).  The Board, on the \r\n  other hand, sits as a quasi-judicial tribunal in reviewing the final decision \r\n  of the ALJ.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(A) (Supp. 2003).  As the reviewing tribunal, \r\n  the Board is not entitled to make findings of fact.  Id.  The Boardâ€™s \r\n  findings are based on the ALJâ€™s findings. \r\n  [2]   \r\nOn appeal, the ALJâ€™s findings must be affirmed if they are supported \r\n  by substantial evidence in the record.  Substantial evidence is â€œevidence which, \r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the \r\n  conclusion that the administrative agency reached.â€  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 \r\n  S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).  A reviewing court may reverse or \r\n  modify the decision of any agency if substantial rights of the appellant have \r\n  been prejudiced because the findings or decisions of the agency are:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  in violation of the constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         in excess \r\n  of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (d)&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;affected \r\n  by other error of law;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable probative and substantial evidence \r\n  on the whole record; or\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (f)&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted \r\n  exercise of discretion.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(D) (Supp. 2003).\r\nWe reverse the decision of the circuit court because substantial\r\nrights of SRRI have been prejudiced.  The finding of the circuit court the \r\n  revocation of the consistency determination compelled denial of the permit is \r\n  affected by error of law. \r\nI.\r\nThe South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and Management Act, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-10, et seq. (2002) (the SWPMA), requires a person \r\n  obtain a permit from DHEC before operating a solid waste management facility.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(A).  Permits are issued based upon local need for \r\n  the requested facility and the consistency of the proposed facility with local \r\n  ordinances.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(E).   DHEC cannot issue a permit unless \r\n  the proposed facility is consistent with â€œlocal zoning, land use, and other \r\n  applicable ordinances.â€  The SWPMA does not specify procedures for DHEC to follow \r\n  in making need and consistency determinations.  \r\nDHECâ€™s practice has been to delegate to the \r\n  counties the authority to determine consistency through the countiesâ€™ issuance \r\n  of LOCs.  We conclude this delegation of authority is impermissible.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(F) does not give a county veto authority over decisions made \r\n  by DHEC.  There is no statutory authority providing a countyâ€™s consistency determination \r\n  is determinative of the ultimate permitting decision.  Although Section 44-96-290(F) \r\n  requires a proposed facility comply with local standards, it does not designate \r\n  the county as the final arbiter on whether the proposed facility complies with \r\n  its local zoning, land use, and other ordinances.  \r\nIn this case, DHEC withdrew its initial decision to issue \r\n  the permit in error because it based its decision solely on Newberry Countyâ€™s \r\n  withdrawal of the LOC.  The SWPMA authorizes DHEC to â€œissue, deny, revoke or \r\n  modify permits, registrations, or orders under such conditions as the department \r\n  may prescribeâ€¦for the operation of solid waste management facilities.â€  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-260(2) (2002).  DHEC, not the county, is charged with ensuring \r\n  such facilities meet the requirements for permitting.  \r\nII.\r\nUnder the facts of this case, there is no basis for concluding \r\n  the proposed landfill is inconsistent with the Newberry County Solid Waste Management \r\n  Plan.  The ALJ relied on Section 4.1.3 of the Plan.  Section 4.1.3 of the plan \r\n  â€œIndustrial Collectionâ€ provides:\r\n\r\nIn Newberry County, industries are responsible for their\r\nown solid waste collection and disposal.  There are several private haulers operating in the County under separate contracts with different \r\n  industries.  This stream of solid waste is completely outside the operation, \r\n  direct knowledge or control of Newberry County.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that Section 4.1.3 of the Plan refers only \r\n  to private haulers who are operating in the County under contracts with different \r\n  industries.  Therefore, this provision has no application to the prohibition \r\n  of the establishment of an industrial waste landfill.\r\nInstead of relying on Section 4.1.3 of the Plan, the circuit \r\n  court relied on Section 10.2 in finding the proposed facility inconsistent with \r\n  the Plan. [3]   Section 10.2 discusses the goals \r\n  associated with Newberry Countyâ€™s solid waste disposal.  Section 10.2 states, \r\n  in relevant part, that one of the goals is to â€œpreserve, protect, and enhance \r\n  the environmental quality of Newberry County.â€  This broad, general statement \r\n  of goals cannot serve as a basis for concluding the proposed facility is inconsistent \r\n  with Newberry Countyâ€™s plan.  To hold otherwise would invite a reviewing court \r\n  to conclude, on an arbitrary and capricious basis, any proposed landfill facility \r\n  falls within the ambit of such general language.  Therefore, the circuit court \r\n  erred in relying on Section 10.2 in holding the proposed facility inconsistent \r\n  with the Plan.\r\nHaving determined the facility is not inconsistent with \r\n  Newberry Countyâ€™s SWPMA, we conclude the permit should be issued and effective.    \r\n  Before issuing the initial permit in September 1997, DHEC experts determined \r\n  the facility met all regulatory requirements based on a meticulous study of \r\n  SRRIâ€™s proposed facility.   DHEC properly applied the requirements of 25 S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Reg. 61-66 (1976) relating to Industrial Waste Landfills.  A public \r\n  hearing concerning the proposed facility was conducted in March 1997.  DHEC \r\n  received comments both during and after the hearing.  These comments were addressed \r\n  by DHEC in a document entitled â€œResponsiveness Summary.â€  DHEC made specific \r\n  findings including, but not limited to, groundwater protection, excavation procedures, \r\n  and the design of disposal cells as related to the SRRI facility.  Based on \r\n  DHECâ€™s thorough analysis of the proposed facility, they concluded, and we agree, \r\n  the facility is not inconsistent with the County SWPMA or DHECâ€™s regulatory \r\n  requirements.\r\nOur resolution of this matter makes unnecessary a consideration \r\n  of the remaining issues presented by SRRI.  The permit complies with Act 100 \r\n  in that it imposes a 1,000-foot setback from the mobile home.\r\nBecause DHECâ€™s revocation of the permit was based solely \r\n  on Newberry Countyâ€™s withdrawal of its LOC and the proposed facility is not \r\n  inconsistent with the Newberry County Plan, we reverse and order the permit \r\n  issued and effective.\r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1]   This section was formerly Â§ 44-96-290(G) \r\n    and was redesignated as Â§ 44-96-290(F) with the 2000 amendment.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [2]  Marlboro Park Hosp. \r\n    v.

Palmetto Health Alliance, 352 S.C. \r\n  221, 573 S.E.2d 805 (Ct. App. 2002).  We vacate the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion \r\n  in part and affirm in part.\r\nFACTS / BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner was born November 16, 1979, at Baptist Medical \r\n  Center (Hospital) to a 17-year-old unwed mother (Mother).  Hospital and Motherâ€™s \r\n  obstetrician records reflect that, prior to Petitionerâ€™s birth, Mother intended \r\n  to place Petitioner for adoption.  Mother, a resident of Myrtle Beach, S.C., \r\n  who was estranged from her own mother due to the out-of-wedlock pregnancy, was \r\n  taken by a friendâ€™s mother to see a Columbia attorney where they discussed the \r\n  adoption process.  Thereafter, Mother moved to Columbia and, at the suggestion \r\n  of the attorney and the friendâ€™s mother, resided with Claire Rayhorn. [1] \r\nMother testified she had no recollection of signing any \r\n  documents concerning the adoption and none were produced at trial.  Further, \r\n  Claire paid her living expenses and either Claire or the attorney selected her \r\n  obstetrician and the hospital for the birth.\r\nIn 1979, Hospital policies and procedures relating to adoption \r\n  provided the mother was to execute a â€œPermit to Release Baby for Adoptionâ€; \r\n  the mother or her immediate family were allowed to see the infant at any time \r\n  prior to discharge; the adoptive parents were not allowed to see the infant \r\n  while the infant was in Hospital; the mother was allowed to view her infant \r\n  through the nursery window or in her room if she requested; and Hospitalâ€™s social \r\n  services department was to be called if there were questions about adoption.\r\nPetitioner alleged Hospital violated several of its policies \r\n  and procedures.  Mother and Hospitalâ€™s director of Womenâ€™s and Childrenâ€™s Services, \r\n  testified no â€œPermit to Release Baby for Adoptionâ€ was executed by Mother.  \r\n  Mother testified Claire and a Hospital nurse told her she could not see or hold \r\n  her baby after it was born.  She was not permitted to see Petitioner because \r\n  â€œthe baby was being placed up for adoptionâ€ and she was not the adopting parent.\r\n&nbsp;This resulted in a confrontation between Mother and Claire. \r\n  However, Mother did not tell Hospital personnel she decided against the adoption. \r\n  She never saw Petitioner before leaving Hospital.\r\nMother signed two forms entitled â€œPermission to Release \r\n  Baby to Party Other Than Mother.â€  The forms, contained in the medical charts \r\n  of mother and infant, state:\r\n\r\nI, the undersigned, mother of Baby Gardner, who \r\n  was born in [Hospital] on November 16, 1979, hereby authorize and direct [Hospital] \r\n  to release and deliver said baby to [Attorney] or his or her agents and I do \r\n  hereby release and discharge [Hospital] from any claims on account of such release \r\n  and delivery, and I do hereby indemnify and hold harmless the said hospital, \r\n  its personnel, and my physician against any and all claims which may arise therefrom.  \r\n  It has been fully explained to me and I understand this does not in any way \r\n  affect the permanent custody of my child and is given for the purpose of authorizing \r\n  [Hospital] to permit the person named above to remove my child from the hospital \r\n  as an accommodation to me. [2] \r\nMother, believing the adoption to be completed, made no \r\n  attempt to recover her baby in the weeks or years following Petitionerâ€™s birth.\r\n\r\nThe putative adoptive parents, the Bergstroms, lived a nomadic \r\n  lifestyle and Petitioner was taken into custody by Colorado authorities after \r\n  an investigation revealed Ms. Bergstromâ€™s boyfriend had taken nude photos of \r\n  Petitioner at age 11.  \r\nIn 1994, Colorado authorities determined Petitionerâ€™s birth certificate \r\n  was forged and contacted Columbia, S.C., police.  The birth certificate listed \r\n  Linda Katherine Van Cleef as the mother and was signed by Linda K. Bergstrom.  \r\n  The investigation led police to Mother, who for the first time learned the whereabouts \r\n  of Petitioner, who was then 14 years old.  The investigation revealed the Columbia \r\n  attorney delivered the baby to the Bergstroms at Hospital and was paid $2,000 \r\n  as reimbursement for medical expenses.  The adoption proceeding was not completed.  \r\n  Mother was granted custody of Petitioner in 1996.\r\nThis action commenced in 1998, alleging causes of action \r\n  for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The circuit \r\n  court denied Hospitalâ€™s Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss the negligence \r\n  claim but granted Hospitalâ€™s motion to dismiss the claim for intentional infliction \r\n  of emotional distress.  The circuit court further ruled the statutory limit \r\n  on any recovery was $100,000.\r\nThe case was tried to a jury in 2000.  The trial judge granted \r\n  Hospitalâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the negligence claim.  Petitioner \r\n  appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding Hospital owed a legal duty \r\n  of due care only to the Mother, not the infant.  The Court of Appeals further \r\n  held Petitioner could not satisfy the requirement she prove her damages were \r\n  proximately caused by Hospitalâ€™s alleged negligence.  The Court of Appeals affirmed \r\n  the dismissal of the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional \r\n  distress, and did not reach the damages limitation issue.  Bergstrom, \r\n  352 S.C. at 228-233, 573 S.E.2d at 808-810.\r\nIt is not necessary to address the issues of duty or proximate \r\n  cause in this case.  Accordingly, we vacate the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion addressing \r\n  those matters and affirm the Court of Appeals in result.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I. \r\n         Did the circuit court err in ruling the statutory limit on any recovery \r\n  by Petitioner was $100,000?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II. \r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the pretrial dismissal under \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, of Petitionerâ€™s cause of action for intentional infliction \r\n  of emotional distress?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  [3] \r\nA trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when \r\n  â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.â€  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.  See also Tupper v. Dorchester \r\n  County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).  In determining whether any \r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable \r\n  inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to \r\n  the non-moving party.  Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 365 S.E.2d 24 \r\n  (1988).  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court \r\n  will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from \r\n  the evidence in a light most favorable to appellant, the non-moving party below.  \r\n  Williams v. Chesterfield Lumber Co., 267 S.C. 607, 230 S.E.2d 447 (1976).\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move to dismiss \r\n  a complaint based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause \r\n  of action.  In considering such a motion, the trial court must base its ruling \r\n  solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.  If the facts and inferences \r\n  drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then \r\n  the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper.  \r\n  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999).  In deciding \r\n  whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, the appellate \r\n  court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.  Gentry v. Yonce, \r\n  337 S.C. 1, 522 S.E.2d 137 (1999).  A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) \r\n  should not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom \r\n  entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory.  Id.  Further, the \r\n  complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff \r\n  will prevail in the action.  Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d \r\n  8 (1987).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.  Statutory limit on recovery\r\nThe circuit court ruled Petitionerâ€™s recovery was limited \r\n  to $100,000 by the charitable immunity statute in effect in 1979, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-7-50 (1976).  The Court of Appeals did not address this issue, given \r\n  its affirmance of the dismissal of Petitionerâ€™s lawsuit on the grounds of no \r\n  duty and no proximate cause.  Bergstrom, 352 S.C. at 234, 573 S.E.2d \r\n  at 811.\r\nPetitioner contends the circuit court erred because, if \r\n  Â§ 44-7-50 was unconstitutional as declared in 1992 in Hanvey v. Oconee Mem. \r\n  Hosp., 308 S.C. 1, 416 S.E.2d 623, then it was unconstitutional in 1979.  \r\n  Therefore, there is no statutory cap on liability in this case.\r\nHospital asserts this case is controlled by Laughridge v. Parkinson, \r\n  304 S.C. 51, 403 S.E.2d 120 (1991), in which we held the decision in Fitzer \r\n  v. Greater Greenville YMCA, 277 S.C. 1, 282 S.E.2d 230 (1981), abolishing \r\n  charitable immunity would not be applied retroactively.  Laughridge is \r\n  not controlling because it does not address whether a statute later declared \r\n  unconstitutional is deemed void ab initio.  \r\nIn 1977, we abolished the doctrine of charitable immunity only as \r\n  it pertained to hospitals, holding a hospital could be held liable for heedless \r\n  or reckless acts.  A hospital would not be liable for acts that were simply \r\n  negligent.  Brown v. Anderson County Hosp. Assâ€™n, 268 S.C. 479, 234 S.E.2d \r\n  873 (1977).  Thereafter, the Legislature enacted Â§ 44-7-50, which modified charitable \r\n  immunity as it applied to hospitals by providing they could be held liable for \r\n  tortious acts or omissions.  Act No. 182 Â§ 3, 1977 Acts 453; Laughridge, \r\n  304 S.C. at 54 n.1, 403 S.E.2d 120 at n.1.  Petitioner was born in 1979 at Hospital \r\n  when Â§ 44-7-50 was in effect. \r\nIn 1981, we abolished the doctrine of charitable immunity \r\n  in its entirety.  Fitzer, supra.  In 1984, the Legislature enacted \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 33-55-200 to -230, which limited the liability of charitable \r\n  organizations to $200,000, except for charitable hospitals from which recovery \r\n  was still limited to $100,000 by Â§ 44-7-50.  Act No. 505, 1984 Acts 2144.\r\nIn 1986, we held that Fitzer had, by clear implication, \r\n  overruled Â§ 44-7-50, â€œrender[ing] charities of all kinds subject to suit to \r\n  the same extent as all other persons, firms and corporations, allowing recovery \r\n  of both actual and punitive damages.â€  Hasell v. Medical Society of South \r\n  Carolina, Inc., 288 S.C. 318, 321, 342 S.E.2d 594, 595 (1986), overruled \r\n  on other grounds by Hanvey v. Oconee Mem. Hosp., 308 S.C. 1, 416 \r\n  S.E.2d 623 (1992).  Since the alleged malpractice in Hasell occurred \r\n  after Fitzer totally abolished charitable immunity, the plaintiffâ€™s recovery \r\n  in Hasell was no longer limited by Â§ 44-7-50.  However, we declined to \r\n  address the constitutionality of Â§ 44-7-50.  Hasell is not dispositive \r\n  in the present case because the alleged negligence occurred in 1979, two years \r\n  before Fitzer was decided.\r\nIn 1992, we reached the question we had declined to address \r\n  in Hasell and declared Â§ 44-7-50 unconstitutional, ruling it violated \r\n  the Equal Protection Clause because there was no rational basis for treating \r\n  charitable hospitals different from other charitable organizations.  We held \r\n  the limit on recovery from a charitable hospital was $200,000 pursuant to Â§ \r\n  33-55-210.  Hanvey v. Oconee Mem. Hosp., 308 S.C. 1, 416 S.E.2d 623 (explaining \r\n  the somewhat convoluted development of the statutory and case law governing \r\n  charitable immunity). [4] \r\nâ€œA cause of action accrues at the moment when the plaintiff \r\n  has a legal right to sue on it.  The law presumes at least nominal damages at \r\n  that point.  The fact that substantial damages did not occur until later is \r\n  immaterial to determining when the action accrued or arose.â€  Stephens v. \r\n  Draffin, 327 S.C. 1, 5, 488 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1997) (tort claims of patient \r\n  who had been treated for years by his physician, and claims of patientâ€™s wife, \r\n  accrued before the date contributory negligence was abrogated; thus their claims \r\n  were controlled by doctrine of contributory negligence as that rule was in effect \r\n  when their claims first accrued) (citations omitted).\r\nâ€œIn South Carolina, the law in effect at the time the cause \r\n  of action accrued controls the partiesâ€™ legal relationships and rights.â€  Id; \r\n  see also Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 371, 585 S.E.2d \r\n  292, 297 (2003) (plaintiffsâ€™ claims accrued prior to filing of class action \r\n  lawsuit; therefore, version of consumer protection statute in effect when plaintiffs \r\n  filed the lawsuit and court granted summary judgment was controlling); Murphy \r\n  v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 356 S.C. 592, 590 S.E.2d 479, 482-484 \r\n  (2003) (cause of action ordinarily accrues when facts relating to negligence \r\n  and damages exist which authorize one party to maintain an action against another); \r\n  Swindler v. Swindler, 355 S.C. 245, 247 n.1, 584 S.E.2d 438, 439 n.1 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003) (applying provisions of Uniform Commercial Code in effect when \r\n  cause of action accrued).\r\nPetitionerâ€™s cause of action accrued in 1979 when Hospital \r\n  allegedly failed to follow its adoption policies and Petitioner was discharged \r\n  to an attorney, who in turn delivered her to a stranger.  Facts relating to \r\n  Hospitalâ€™s negligence and Petitionerâ€™s damages existed in 1979, regardless of \r\n  any future increase in alleged damages or the fact the statute of limitations \r\n  was tolled until Petitioner reached the age of majority.  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-3-40 (Supp. 2003) (minor tolling provision).  \r\nThe more difficult question is whether our declaration in \r\n  1992 in Hanvey, supra, of the unconstitutionality of Â§ 44-7-50 \r\n  means the statute was unconstitutional from the date of its enactment in 1977.  \r\n  We have not often addressed the issue of the retroactivity of a declaration \r\n  of the unconstitutionality of a statute.  A review of our cases, as well as \r\n  foreign cases, reveals that such a ruling generally means the statute is void \r\n  ab initio, absent special circumstances.  See cases collected \r\n  in Westâ€™s Digests, Statutes, Key Nos. 63 and 64.\r\n  \r\nStatutes are presumed to be constitutional and will not \r\n  be found to violate the constitution unless their invalidity is proven beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt.  See, e.g., Knotts v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural \r\n  Resources, 348 S.C. 1, 6, 558 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2002); Feldman &amp; Co. \r\n  v. City of Charleston, 23 S.C. 57, 66 (1885).  When a statute is found unconstitutional, \r\n  we have recognized the â€œgeneral rule that an adjudication of [the] unconstitutionality \r\n  of a statute ordinarily reaches back to the date of the act itself. . . .â€  \r\n  Trustees of Wofford College v. Burnett, 209 S.C. 92, 102, 39 S.E.2d 155, \r\n  159 (1946) (concluding tax abatements granted by state and local officials were \r\n  voided by courtâ€™s declaration that statute purporting to grant property tax \r\n  exemption to colleges for real estate not actually occupied by colleges was \r\n  unconstitutional); Herndon v. Moore, 18 S.C. 339, 354 (1883) (recognizing \r\n  general principle). \r\nGenerally, â€œwhen a statute is adjudged to be unconstitutional, \r\n  it is as if it had never been.  Rights cannot be built up under it; . . . it \r\n  constitutes a protection to no one who has acted under it.â€  Atkins v. Southern \r\n  Express Co., 94 S.C. 444, 453, 78 S.E. 516, 519 (1913) (holding that portions \r\n  of criminal statute which prohibited importation of alcoholic beverages into \r\n  South Carolina from another state for personal use were unconstitutional when \r\n  enacted as statute violated interstate commerce principles); Feldman &amp; \r\n  Co. v. City of Charleston, 23 S.C. 57 (1885) (issuance of $2 million in \r\n  â€œfire loanâ€ bonds under a city ordinance, which later was ratified by an act \r\n  of Legislature, was for private purposes and thus violated constitutional requirement \r\n  that taxes be levied only for public purposes; cityâ€™s ordinance and Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  act were unconstitutional and void when enacted, which meant the bonds were \r\n  not a valid debt of city and no action could be maintained to enforce their \r\n  payment); see also 16A Am.Jur.2d Constitutional Law Â§Â§ 203 to \r\n  206 (1998) (discussing general rule and its exceptions); 16 C.J.S. Constitutional \r\n  Law Â§ 108 (1984) (same).\r\nHowever, we also have recognized the necessity of upholding the validity \r\n  of transactions or events that occurred before a statute was declared unconstitutional.  \r\n  See Knotts, 348 S.C. at 11, 558 S.E.2d at 516 (while statute allowing \r\n  members of legislative branch to oversee spending of funds was an unconstitutional \r\n  violation of separation of powers and void in its entirety, executive branch \r\n  agency would still be allowed to fulfill its proviso obligations under recent \r\n  appropriations act); Oâ€™Shields v. Caldwell, 207 S.C. 194, 224, 35 S.E.2d \r\n  184, 196 (1945) (a public officer charged with disbursing funds usually is not \r\n  liable for paying out public money when directed to do so by statute even when \r\n  the statute later is found unconstitutional, unless officer acted fraudulently \r\n  or in bad faith) (Oxner, J., dissenting in part) [5] ; Herndon, 18 S.C. at 352-358 (applying \r\n  exceptional doctrine of communis error facit jus - â€œcommon error makes \r\n  rightâ€ - to hold the great number of sales involving thousands of acres of property \r\n  during ten-year period by probate courts were valid even though probate courts \r\n  were later determined not to have subject matter jurisdiction to conduct such \r\n  sales because statute purporting to grant such jurisdiction was unconstitutional).\r\nSection 44-7-50, which we declared unconstitutional in 1992, \r\n  was unconstitutional from the date of its enactment in 1977 and thus void ab \r\n  initio.  A close reading of the few South Carolina cases discussing the \r\n  general rule indicates it is followed except in special or unusual circumstances, \r\n  such as when doing so would create widespread havoc involving a great number \r\n  of people or transactions, spawn unnecessary litigation, or result in flagrant \r\n  injustice.  See Herndon, supra, and Oâ€™Shields, supra.  \r\n  None of those situations is presented in the instant case.\r\nPetitionerâ€™s cause of action accrued in 1979 and is governed \r\n  by the law then in effect.  Our conclusion Â§ 44-7-50 was void ab initio \r\n  means the controlling law in 1979 was Brown, 268 S.C. 479, 234 S.E.2d \r\n  873.  Under that case, Petitioner is required to prove Hospitalâ€™s acts were \r\n  reckless, not simply negligent.  Viewing the facts in the light most favorable \r\n  to Petitioner as we must, we conclude, while Hospital arguably may have acted \r\n  negligently in failing to follow certain policies, Hospitalâ€™s acts as a matter \r\n  of law do not rise to the required level of recklessness.  Therefore, even if \r\n  we assume without deciding that Hospital owed a duty to both Mother and Petitioner, \r\n  and if we were to apply the maxim that proximate cause is an issue for the jury, \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s cause of action nevertheless fails because she has not presented \r\n  evidence Hospital acted recklessly.  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (appellate \r\n  court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record).\r\nII.  Dismissal of action for intentional \r\n  infliction of emotional distress\r\nThe circuit court dismissed Petitionerâ€™s cause of action \r\n  for intentional infliction of emotional distress, ruling pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \r\n  SCRCP, that Petitioner failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause \r\n  of action.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but reasoned the facts as stated \r\n  in the complaint failed to show the Hospitalâ€™s conduct was the proximate cause \r\n  of Petitionerâ€™s damages.  Bergstrom, 352 S.C. at 233-234, 573 S.E.2d \r\n  811.\r\nTo state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional \r\n  distress, a plaintiff must show (1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly \r\n  inflicted severe emotional distress, or was certain or substantially certain \r\n  that such distress would result from his conduct; (2) the conduct was so extreme \r\n  and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded \r\n  as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the actions \r\n  of defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s emotional distress; and (4) the emotional \r\n  distress suffered by the plaintiff was so severe that no reasonable person could \r\n  be expected to endure it.  Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 276 S.E.2d 776 \r\n  (1981).\r\nThe facts relating to Hospital set forth in Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  complaint are that Mother was admitted to Hospital for delivery, Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  nurse repeatedly refused to let her see Petitioner because she was not the adopting \r\n  parent, and Hospital forced Mother to sign a form against her will authorizing \r\n  an attorney to remove Petitioner from Hospital.  \r\nWe conclude the circuit court erred in dismissing this action \r\n  when the facts and inferences therefrom as set forth in the complaint are viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to Petitioner.  If Hospital recklessly or intentionally \r\n  made repeated and coercive efforts to separate a mother from her newborn infant, \r\n  that might well constitute outrageous conduct that we would find utterly intolerable \r\n  in a civilized community.  Such conduct conceivably could cause severe emotional \r\n  distress.\r\n&nbsp;However, the evidence presented at trial revealed that, \r\n  while Hospitalâ€™s staff arguably may have acted negligently in failing to follow \r\n  certain policies, the staff did not act recklessly or intentionally in the extreme \r\n  or outrageous manner described in the complaint.  Thus, it would have been proper \r\n  for the trial judge to dismiss the action for intentional infliction of emotional \r\n  distress on a directed verdict motion at the close of Petitionerâ€™s case.  Accordingly, \r\n  we affirm in result the ruling of the Court of Appeals on this issue.  See \r\n  Rule 220(c), SCACR (appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the \r\n  record).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude it is unnecessary to address the issues of duty \r\n  or proximate cause in this case.  Accordingly, we vacate those portions of the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.  We conclude Â§ 44-7-50 was void ab initio \r\n  due to the 1992 decision finding it unconstitutional.\r\nAbsent that statute, the law in effect in 1979 when Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  cause of action accrued requires Petitioner prove Hospitalâ€™s actions were reckless, \r\n  not merely negligent.  Petitioner in her negligence action has not met the requisite \r\n  burden of production of evidence, viewing the facts adduced at trial in the \r\n  light most favorable to her.  Petitionerâ€™s action for intentional infliction \r\n  of emotional distress fails for similar reasons; consequently, we affirm in \r\n  result the dismissal of this action\r\n VACATED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Brogdon, Jr., \r\n  concur.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   \r\n    Claire is referred to in the record as Claire or Clara, with a last name of \r\n    Rayhorn, Raymond, Manors, or Wilson.

The order mentions both Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule \r\n    56, SCRCP.  We will review the first issue pursuant to the standard for Rule \r\n    56 motions.  We will review the second issue pursuant to the standard for \r\n    Rule 12(b)(6) motions, as did the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   In 1994, the Legislature repealed \r\n    Â§ 33-55-210 and enacted S.C.

[1]   The Court of Appealsâ€™ unpublished opinion \r\n  affirmed Petitionerâ€™s convictions for murder, kidnapping, and criminal conspiracy \r\n  and reversed the criminal sexual conduct conviction because there was no evidence \r\n  Petitioner sexually assaulted Darlene Patterson (Victim), or acted in concert \r\n  with others to sexually assault her.  State v. McIntosh, Op. No. 2001-UP-479 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed November 8, 2001).\r\nWe granted the petition for a writ of certiorari \r\n  to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion the prosecutor did not commit a Doyle \r\n  [2]  violation by questioning Petitioner about the fact he did not present \r\n  his alibi defense to police after he was arrested and read his Miranda \r\n  [3]  rights.  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe body of Victim, 36, was found on November 24, 1994, partially \r\n  submerged in a pond near Burnt Factory Road in rural Marlboro County.  Victim \r\n  had been missing since November 12, 1994.  Her ankles and hands had been bound \r\n  with gray duct tape; the tape also had been wrapped tightly around her face \r\n  and head.  \r\nThe medical examiner testified Victim likely died of asphyxiation \r\n  due to the tape around her face and head.  Victim probably was dead before her \r\n  body was placed in the pond, although the examiner could not rule out death \r\n  by drowning.  Further, the death likely occurred between November 12 and 20, \r\n  1994, and probably closer to November 12.  The autopsy revealed no physical \r\n  evidence that Victim had been sexually assaulted before her death, although \r\n  the fact Victim was a mature woman and the body had partially decomposed made \r\n  it more difficult to obtain such evidence if any existed.  \r\nInvestigators examined items recovered from an abandoned house, where \r\n  Victim had been held, and from the pond, including Victimâ€™s pocketbook, eyeglasses, \r\n  an earring, and duct tape samples.  However, investigators were unable to identify \r\n  any physical or trace evidence (fingerprints, samples of hair, blood, semen, \r\n  or the like) linking Petitioner or any other person to Victimâ€™s kidnapping and \r\n  death.  The Stateâ€™s case against Petitioner and other co-defendants consisted \r\n  primarily of the testimony from co-defendants, Danny Davis and Bobby Ransom.\r\nDavis and Ransom testified they observed Victim tied up and lying \r\n  on a couch or bed during a cookout and party at two co-defendantsâ€™ mobile home.  \r\n  Both accompanied several co-defendants on a trip to move Victim from the mobile \r\n  home to an abandoned house.  Ransom testified he was smoking marijuana and drinking \r\n  creek liquor (a type of  â€œwhite lightningâ€ or moonshine) when several co-defendants \r\n  arrived at his house the next night and asked him to join them on a trip back \r\n  to the abandoned house.  When he saw his visitors approaching, Ransom drank \r\n  the remaining half of a pint of creek liquor he had been drinking so they would \r\n  not ask him for any.\r\nDavis and Ransom testified Petitioner and another co-defendant were waiting \r\n  when they arrived at an abandoned house where Victim had been left the previous \r\n  night.  Several unidentified co-defendants carried Victim, still bound by tape, \r\n  to the car and put her in the back seat beside Ransom.  Ransom testified he \r\n  began â€œfreaking outâ€ when the â€œliquor hit [him]â€ and he begged them to stop \r\n  Victim from â€œcrying all over [him],â€ although she really was not.  The eight \r\n  co-defendants - including Davis, Ransom, and Petitioner - rode in a single car \r\n  to a bridge, where unidentified co-defendants placed Victimâ€™s body in the pond.    \r\n\r\nDavis and Ransom were cross-examined at length about their extensive history \r\n  of alcohol and substance abuse.  Davis testified he suffered brain damage from \r\n  a traumatic head injury 10 years earlier, as well as anxiety, sleeplessness, \r\n  and depression.  He was a victim of child abuse and had extensively abused alcohol \r\n  and illegal drugs for years.  He testified he drank heavily every day during \r\n  November 1994.  His alcohol use caused him to forget events and confuse things.  \r\n  During his two-year incarceration preceding the trial, Davis testified he saw \r\n  nonexistent shadows, heard â€œa lot of  [nonexistent] voices,â€ and talked with \r\n  imaginary friends.  He was taking anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications \r\n  during his incarceration and the trial.  \r\nRansom testified he had been paralyzed from the chest down since 1983.  In \r\n  November 1994, he had been on a drinking binge for some three years and eight \r\n  or nine months.  He often blacked out and suffered from memory loss.  He had \r\n  been hospitalized at psychiatric facilities three times before 1996 for abuse \r\n  of alcohol and numerous drugs, including Valium, Xanax, sleeping pills, amphetamines, \r\n  powder cocaine, crack cocaine, acid, marijuana, and â€œhuffingâ€ gasoline.  He \r\n  drank two quarts to a gallon of alcohol each week, including creek liquor.\r\nDavis and Ransom testified on cross-examination they were good friends who \r\n  grew up together.  Davis often visited the reclusive Ransom at his house in \r\n  1994, and they saw one another frequently during a four-month period after the \r\n  crime until their arrest.  Police in March 1995 brought Ransom from another \r\n  jail to see Davis in jail so Ransom could â€œconfrontâ€ Davis about the crimes.  \r\n  The two confessed to police the same afternoon at the same location, and, for \r\n  the first time, Ransom implicated Petitioner.\r\nAt his guilty plea prior to Petitionerâ€™s trial, Davis stated, â€œa lot of this \r\n  stuff I canâ€™t quite remember, but my co-defendant [Ransom] has - heâ€™s told me \r\n  everything.â€  While insisting he was trying to tell the truth at petitionerâ€™s \r\n  trial, Davis testified he had changed his story â€œa lot of times,â€ although not \r\n  every time he talked to police during fifteen to twenty interviews.  He â€œtold \r\n  [police] what they wanted to hear.â€  In fact, he testified he no longer had \r\n  an independent recollection of even being at the bridge that night, but based \r\n  his trial testimony on some other source.  \r\nPetitioner, then 29, denied any involvement in the crimes, testifying \r\n  he was in New York when they occurred.  Petitioner testified that in 1994 he \r\n  lived in Brooklyn, New York, where he was raised.  Since his childhood, he often \r\n  traveled to Marlboro County, where his father was raised, to visit family and \r\n  friends.\r\nPetitioner testified he stayed in Marlboro County, in September 1994, \r\n  for a week or two with a friend, Butch Moore and then returned to New York.  \r\n  On November 2, 1994, he left New York with two friends and traveled to Marlboro \r\n  County, again staying with Butch Moore.  He returned to New York on November \r\n  7, 1994.  To establish these dates, Petitioner entered into evidence a rental \r\n  car receipt. [4]   He also testified \r\n  he attended his godfatherâ€™s birthday party in New York on November 9, 1994.  \r\n  Petitioner tried to subpoena Moore to the trial, but the sheriffâ€™s office was \r\n  unable to locate him.  \r\nPetitioner testified he again returned to Marlboro County by bus \r\n  on the morning of November 23, 1994.  He stayed several days with a cousin, \r\n  but also visited the home and automobile repair shop of Joe Stuckey on Thanksgiving \r\n  Day.  In December 1994, Petitioner moved into the mobile home with co-defendants \r\n  Ricky Stuckey and Robert Graham.  He testified he had been to that mobile home \r\n  - where Victim had been seen during the cookout and party - only once.  Petitioner \r\n  worked some at Joe Stuckeyâ€™s shop and heard that Victimâ€™s body had been found, \r\n  but testified he did not hear anyone say they were involved in the crimes. \r\nIn January 1995, while he was working at the shop, police examined \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s identification but did not question him.  In February 1995, Petitioner \r\n  received a subpoena to appear before a federal grand jury investigating Victimâ€™s \r\n  murder.  Petitioner testified he returned to New York later that month.  In \r\n  April 1995, Petitioner returned to Columbia to testify before the grand jury.  \r\n  He was told he was not on the grand jury witness list and would not be called.  \r\n  Petitioner asked the secretary to call Marlboro County authorities because he \r\n  had heard they had warrants for him.  He was transported to Marlboro County, \r\n  where he was arrested for murder and read his Miranda rights.  \r\nDuring direct examination, Petitioner testified as follows:\r\n\r\nQ.  And they read you your rights at that time?\r\nA.  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.  Told you you were under arrest?\r\nA.  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.  Did they ask you to make a statement?\r\nA.  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.  And what did you tell them?\r\nA.  I didnâ€™t want to make a statement about something I didnâ€™t know about. \r\nQ.  And at that point, you were arrested?\r\nA.  Yes, sir. \r\n\r\nThe following testimony occurred during cross-examination \r\n  of Petitioner:\r\n\r\nQ.  Well, letâ€™s talk some more about your story here.  Now, \r\n  the truth is the first time that you have told anybody in law enforcement this \r\n  story about your being in New York is today, isnâ€™t it?\r\n A.  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.  You ainâ€™t - for two-and-a-half years, you ainâ€™t never \r\n  told this story.\r\n\r\nPetitioner raised a Doyle objection, arguing the prosecutor \r\n  was not allowed to question Petitioner about his post-arrest, post-Miranda \r\n  silence or his failure to tell police he was in New York when the crimes occurred.  \r\n  He argued such questions violate his right to remain silent.  The prosecutor \r\n  contended Petitioner was in Marlboro County when the crimes occurred.  Because \r\n  Petitioner was asserting he was not in the county, the State was entitled to \r\n  show that he never told police that at any time.  The trial judge overruled \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s objection.\r\nThe cross-examination continued:\r\n\r\nQ.  Letâ€™s go back to where we stopped.  What I was asking \r\n  was the police talked to you, did they not?\r\n A.  Thatâ€™s according to when youâ€™re talking about.\r\n Q.  Well, letâ€™s talk about when you came to Columbia.  You \r\n  told your lawyer that you came down to Columbia?\r\n A.  Yes, sir.\r\n Q.  And the police wanted to talk to you?\r\n A.  Yes, sir.\r\n Q.  And you talked to them, agreed to talk to them, did \r\n  you not?\r\n A.  Yes, sir.\r\n Q.  And you told them at that point in time, yeah, I donâ€™t \r\n  know anything about this thing.  I was in New York.\r\n A.  No, I never mentioned where I was.  I just told them \r\n  I didnâ€™t know what they were talking about and they asked me did I want to make \r\n  a statement.  I told them no.  Then they asked - they kept asking me to make \r\n  statements.  I told them I wanted to speak to a lawyer.\r\n Q.  And when you told them you wanted to speak to a lawyer, \r\n  they stopped, didnâ€™t they?\r\nA.  No, they continued to ask me questions.\r\nQ.  Well, did you tell them anything?\r\nA.  No.\r\nQ.  So thatâ€™s my point.  They stopped you at some point \r\n  because youâ€™re here and you didnâ€™t tell them anything.  Right?\r\nA.  Even after they talked to me - the same day I came to Marlboro County up \r\n  from Columbia, thatâ€™s the same day they appointed me a lawyer.  They took me \r\n  to Charlie Usher I believe his name is.\r\nQ.  Uh-huh.\r\nA.  And appointed a lawyer.  But they still came to question me.\r\n\r\nFollowing Petitionerâ€™s testimony, the judge instructed the jury: \r\n\r\n\r\n[t]here is some testimony in this record regarding this individual of an alleged \r\n  statement that he makes.  In this connection, I tell you that a defendant has \r\n  the absolute right to make a statement.  If he elects to remain absolutely silent, \r\n  that is his absolute constitutional right, and his silence may not be used against \r\n  him.  A defendant if he elects to make a statement may stop at any time and \r\n  thereafter elect to remain silent.  And if, should that occur, that silence \r\n  cannot and must not be used against him in any way whatsoever.  The fact that \r\n  he elects initially or later, that fact cannot be used against any defendant \r\n  and this defendant whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIn closing arguments, neither Petitioner nor the State mentioned \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s testimony about what he did or did not tell police after his arrest.  \r\n  Petitioner was found guilty on all counts. \r\n  [5]   He was sentenced to life in prison for murder, thirty years consecutive \r\n  for first-degree criminal sexual conduct, five years concurrent for criminal \r\n  conspiracy. [6]   \r\nOn appeal, Petitioner contended the Stateâ€™s cross-examination on his post-arrest, \r\n  post-Miranda silence was a violation of due process pursuant to Doyle.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals held no Doyle violation occurred because Petitioner \r\n  emphasized his cooperation with authorities in his direct examination, opening \r\n  the door to the Stateâ€™s cross-examination.  The Court of Appeals further concluded \r\n  any error was harmless because it was cured by the trial courtâ€™s charge following \r\n  the solicitorâ€™s cross-examination.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding Petitioner, during direct examination, \r\n  presented the defense he had cooperated with police, thus opening the door to \r\n  otherwise impermissible cross-examination on his post-arrest, post-Miranda \r\n  silence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner contends the Court of Appeals erred in holding he â€œopened \r\n  the doorâ€ to a Doyle violation.  Petitioner argues he did not assert \r\n  he cooperated with police, but only explained his travels between South Carolina \r\n  and New York and his contacts with police in anticipation the prosecutor would \r\n  argue he was fleeing from the crimes.  Furthermore, Petitioner asserts the error \r\n  was not harmless and was not cured by the judgeâ€™s instruction immediately following \r\n  the solicitorâ€™s cross-examination.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has held the Due Process Clause of \r\n  the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a state prosecutor seeks to impeach \r\n  a defendantâ€™s exculpatory story, told for the first time at the trial, by cross-examining \r\n  him about his post-arrest silence after receiving the Miranda warnings.  \r\n  Doyle, 426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. at 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d at 98.\r\nIn Doyle, the state prosecutor presented evidence a police \r\n  informant sold marijuana to defendants.  The defendants testified they had been \r\n  framed by the informant because they were not the sellers, but had intended \r\n  to buy marijuana from the informant.  Both were arrested within minutes \r\n  of the alleged crime, were advised of their Miranda rights, and chose \r\n  not to make any substantive post-arrest statements.  During cross-examination \r\n  at separate trials, the prosecutor questioned the defendants why they did not \r\n  promptly assert their innocence after their arrest by telling police their exculpatory \r\n  story.  Doyle, 426 U.S. at 611-614, 96 S.Ct. at 2243-2244, 49 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 94-96.\r\nIn finding a due process violation, the Court rejected the Stateâ€™s \r\n  arguments such cross-examination was necessary to show a defendant may have \r\n  concocted a false, exculpatory story after his arrest.\r\n\r\nSilence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arresteeâ€™s \r\n  exercise of these Miranda rights.  Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly \r\n  ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested.  \r\n  Moreover, while it is true the Miranda warnings contain no express assurance \r\n  that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person \r\n  who receives the warnings.  In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally \r\n  unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested personâ€™s silence \r\n  to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\r\n\r\nDoyle, 426 U.S. at 617-618, 96 S.Ct. at 2244-2245, 49 L.Ed.2d at 97-98 \r\n  (citation omitted).\r\nIn limited exceptions to the general rule, the State may cross-examine \r\n  a defendant about his post-arrest, post-Miranda silence when he offers \r\n  an exculpatory story at trial and claims he told police the same version upon \r\n  arrest.  Doyle, 426 U.S. at 619 n.11, 96 S.Ct. at 2245 n.11, 49 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 98 n.11.  Similarly, Doyle does not bar cross-examination into prior \r\n  inconsistent statements made by a defendant who voluntarily speaks after he \r\n  has received the Miranda warnings.  Anderson v. Charles, 447 U.S. \r\n  404, 408, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 2182, 65 L.Ed.2d 222, 226 (1980); State v. Kimsey, \r\n  320 S.C. 344, 465 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe State may point out a defendantâ€™s silence prior to arrest, or \r\n  his silence after arrest but prior to the giving of the Miranda warnings, \r\n  in order to impeach the defendantâ€™s testimony at trial.  Due process is not \r\n  violated because â€œ[s]uch silence is probative and does not rest on any implied \r\n  assurance by law enforcement authorities that it will carry no penalty.â€  Brecht \r\n  v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 628, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1716, 123 L.Ed.2d 353, \r\n  366 (1993); Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 65 L.Ed.2d \r\n  86 (1980).\r\nThe Doyle rule, as well as other principles prohibiting the \r\n  prosecutor from using or commenting on a defendantâ€™s exercise of his constitutional \r\n  rights, is â€œrooted in due process and the belief that justice is best served \r\n  when a trial is fundamentally fair.â€  Edmond v. State, 341 S.C. 340, \r\n  346, 534 S.E.2d 682, 685 (2000).  â€œThe obvious purpose is to try to prevent \r\n  jurors from improperly inferring the accused is guilty simply because he exercised \r\n  rights guaranteed him by the state and federal constitutions.  Such an inference \r\n  is constitutionally impermissible because the burden at all times remains upon \r\n  the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of a crime with which \r\n  the accused is charged.â€  Id.\r\nThis case presents a clear Doyle violation.  Petitioner voluntarily \r\n  returned to South Carolina, as required by a federal subpoena, then voluntarily \r\n  surrendered to Marlboro County authorities who had warrants for his arrest.  \r\n  He was arrested and read his Miranda rights.  He chose not to speak to \r\n  police, other than to deny knowledge of the crimes and ask for a lawyer.\r\nAt trial, the solicitor questioned Petitioner at length about his \r\n  failure to present his alibi defense to police after he was arrested and given \r\n  the Miranda warnings.  The solicitorâ€™s questions were intended to focus \r\n  the juryâ€™s attention on Petitionerâ€™s post-arrest silence as substantive evidence \r\n  of his guilt, a prohibited tactic.  See State v. Smith, 290 S.C. \r\n  393, 394-95, 350 S.E.2d 923, 924 (1986) (finding Doyle violation where \r\n  solicitor asked psychiatrist if he knew defendant had refused to make a statement \r\n  to police; granting new trial as it was not harmless error).  The constitutionally \r\n  impermissible inference the jury may have drawn from testimony about his post-arrest \r\n  silence is Petitioner was guilty simply because he remained silent.  See \r\n  Edmond, 341 S.C. 340, 534 S.E.2d 628 (granting new trial to applicant \r\n  in post-conviction relief action where testimony and prosecutorâ€™s closing improperly \r\n  referred to defendantâ€™s exercise of right to remain silent and right to counsel); \r\n  see also State v. Reid, 324 S.C. 74, 476 S.E.2d 695 (1996) (finding \r\n  Doyle violation when officer, after arresting defendant and advising \r\n  him of his Miranda rights, was asked whether defendant inquired about \r\n  the condition of his passengers after an accident; granting new trial as it \r\n  was not harmless error), overruled on other grounds by State v. Watson, \r\n  349 S.C. 372, 563 S.E.2d 336 (2002); State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 258-259, \r\n  391 S.E.2d 551, 555 (1990) (finding an unpreserved Doyle violation but \r\n  strongly cautioning solicitors against violating the prohibition by commenting \r\n  on defendantâ€™s exercise of constitutional rights); State v. Holliday, \r\n  333 S.C. 332, 340, 509 S.E.2d 280, 284 (Ct. App. 1998) (noting that solicitors \r\n  have been repeatedly warned by appellate courts against violation of Doyle \r\n  prohibition; and granting new trial as violation was not harmless error); State \r\n  v. Gray, 304 S.C. 482, 405 S.E.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding Doyle \r\n  violation where solicitor cross-examined defendant on failure to tell police \r\n  his exculpatory story; and granting new trial as violation was not harmless \r\n  error).\r\nThe State contends Petitioner opened the door to any Doyle \r\n  violation by trying to convince the jury he had fully cooperated with police.  \r\n  Therefore, the prosecutor properly was allowed to cross-examine Petitioner to \r\n  show he had not cooperated with police, but in fact had remained silent. [7] \r\nThe State correctly explains other courts have held a defendant may open the \r\n  door to cross-examination for impeachment purposes by testifying or creating \r\n  the impression through his defense presentation he has cooperated with police \r\n  when, in fact, he has not.  Such cross-examination is permissible, as the Supreme \r\n  Court recognized in Doyle by noting a prosecutor may challenge a defendantâ€™s \r\n  contention he told his exculpatory story to police when he actually did not.  \r\n  Doyle, 426 U.S. at 619 n.11, 96 S.Ct. at 2245 n.11, 49 L.Ed.2d at 98 \r\n  n.11.  See e.g., Kibbe v. Dubois, 269 F.3d 26, 34-35 (1st \r\n  Cir. 2001) (explaining Doyle is not violated when defendant opens the \r\n  door to cross-examination on post-arrest silence by testifying on direct he \r\n  told police what had happened and lawyer stated the same in opening and closing); \r\n  United States v. Reveles, 190 F.3d 678, 684-685 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding \r\n  no Doyle violation because â€œ[w]hen a defendant attempts to convince a \r\n  jury that he was of a cooperative spirit, Doyle does not tie the hands \r\n  of prosecutors who attempt to rebut this presentation by pointing to a lack \r\n  of cooperationâ€); Earnest v. Dorsey, 87 F.3d 1123, 1135 (10th Cir. 1996) \r\n  (finding no Doyle violation because â€œprohibition against reference to \r\n  post-arrest silence does not allow the defendant to freely and falsely create \r\n  the impression that he has cooperated with police when, in fact, he has notâ€); \r\n  United States ex rel. Saulsbury v. Greer, 702 F.2d 651 (7th Cir. 1983) \r\n  (finding no Doyle violation where defendant opened the door to cross-examination \r\n  on post-arrest silence by testifying on direct he did not make a statement to \r\n  the sheriff because it could be used against him and, since he was on parole, \r\n  he did not think the sheriff would believe him); Wentz v. State, 766 \r\n  N.E.2d 351, 362 (Ind. 2002) (finding no Doyle violation because defendant \r\n  opened the door to cross-examination on post-arrest silence by testifying on \r\n  redirect he had answered all the policeâ€™s questions).\r\nIn the Stateâ€™s view, Petitioner claimed he cooperated with police \r\n  and thus opened the door to an otherwise improper line of questioning by (1) \r\n  testifying on direct examination he voluntarily returned to South Carolina and \r\n  he did not give a statement to police upon his arrest; (2) inferring to the \r\n  jury he had told his alibi story to authorities by testifying he was staying \r\n  with Butch Moore when the crimes occurred, but the sheriff had not been able \r\n  to serve a subpoena on Moore shortly before or during the trial; [8]  (3) inferring to the jury he \r\n  really wanted to speak to police but they did not want to talk to him, as they \r\n  only once asked for his identification and later served a federal subpoena on \r\n  him; and (4) testifying on cross-examination before the challenged inquiry â€œif \r\n  I knew anything about any of this, I would have been talking to the police.  \r\n  I would have talked to the people in Columbia a long time ago.â€\r\nWe conclude Petitioner did not open the door to any Doyle \r\n  violation.  Petitioner did not, explicitly or implicitly, assert he cooperated \r\n  with police.  The focus of Petitionerâ€™s defense, as revealed by his actions \r\n  before his arrest and at his arrest, as well as his trial testimony, was he \r\n  was not present when the crimes occurred, knew nothing about the crimes or who \r\n  was involved, and so had nothing to tell police. \r\nIn an analogous case, a defendant made no post-arrest statement to \r\n  police and asserted an alibi defense for the first time at trial in an armed \r\n  robbery case in which â€œ[t]here was no dispute that the crimes charged had been \r\n  committed by someone.â€  State v. Garcia, 887 P.2d 767 (N.M. Ct. App. \r\n  1994).  The prosecutor questioned the defendant why he did not mention his alibi \r\n  defense to a police detective in the hour he spent traveling with the detective \r\n  after his arrest.\r\nThe New Mexico court concluded the prosecutorâ€™s questions violated \r\n  due process, reasoning a defendant who chooses to remain silent about his alibi \r\n  defense until trial does not open the door to this line of questioning.  â€œ[T]here \r\n  is nothing to impeach until the defense has come forward with an explanation.  \r\n  By the Stateâ€™s reasoning, offering an explanation [for the first time at trial] \r\n  would always open the door for the impeachment.â€  Endorsing the Stateâ€™s door-opening \r\n  argument in such a case is not appropriate because it â€œwould completely undercut \r\n  Doyle.â€  Garcia, 887 P.2d at 772.\r\n We further conclude the trial error in this case was not harmless; nor was \r\n  it cured by the judgeâ€™s instruction.  When a Doyle violation occurs, \r\n  the conviction still may be upheld when a review of the entire record establishes \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt the error was harmless.  â€œTo be harmless, the record \r\n  must establish the reference to the defendantâ€™s right to silence was a single \r\n  reference, which was not repeated or alluded to; the solicitor did not tie the \r\n  defendantâ€™s silence directly to his exculpatory story; the exculpatory story \r\n  was totally implausible; and the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.â€  State \r\n  v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 530-531, 466 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1996).  â€œAn instruction \r\n  to disregard incompetent evidence is usually deemed to have cured the error \r\n  unless on the facts of the particular case it is probable that, notwithstanding \r\n  the instruction, the accused was prejudiced.â€  State v. Smith, 290 S.C. \r\n  393, 395, 350 S.E.2d 923, 924 (1986).\r\nIn this case, the prosecutor questioned Petitioner thoroughly about \r\n  his post-arrest, post-Miranda silence, asking him no less than ten questions \r\n  aimed at showing Petitioner never presented his alibi defense to police.  The \r\n  solicitor tied Petitionerâ€™s silence directly to his alibi defense, asking him, \r\n  for example, â€œ[n]ow, the truth is the first time that you have told anybody \r\n  in law enforcement this story about your being in New York is today, isnâ€™t it?â€ \r\n  and â€œ[y]ou ainâ€™t - for two-and-a-half years, you ainâ€™t never told this story.â€\r\nPetitionerâ€™s story was not totally implausible.  He had traveled \r\n  between South Carolina and New York since he was a child.  He had documentary \r\n  proof (the rental car receipt) he had left South Carolina before the crimes \r\n  occurred.  His irregular arrivals and departures, along with the fact he moved \r\n  into the co-defendantsâ€™ mobile home after the crimes occurred and lived there \r\n  for some two months, may have caused the Stateâ€™s two key witnesses to be unable \r\n  to accurately recall whether they saw him at the crime scene or just living \r\n  at the mobile home in following weeks.\r\nFinally, the evidence against Petitioner was not overwhelming.  No physical \r\n  or trace evidence was introduced linking Petitioner to the crimes.  The case \r\n  against Petitioner consisted primarily of the testimony of two witnesses, Davis \r\n  and Ransom.  Both testified about their extensive history of alcohol and substance \r\n  abuse, as well as their memory lapses, before and during the period the crimes \r\n  occurred.  Both Davis and Ransom were interviewed by police numerous times and \r\n  faced the death penalty until they began cooperating.  The testimony of these \r\n  key witnesses cannot be deemed overwhelming, particularly when viewed in light \r\n  of the likely impact the Stateâ€™s improper questioning had on jurorsâ€™ perception \r\n  of Petitionerâ€™s credibility.  See State v. Smith, 309 S.C. 442, \r\n  447, 424 S.E.2d 496, 499 (1992) (admission of testimony about prior drug use \r\n  which likely destroyed defendantâ€™s credibility, in a case where witness credibility \r\n  was crucial to juryâ€™s determination of who and what to believe, could not be \r\n  deemed harmless error); State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d \r\n  241, 243 (1990) (â€œ[e]rror which substantially damages the defendantâ€™s credibility \r\n  cannot be held harmless where such credibility is essential to his defenseâ€).  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the Court of Appeals concluding (1) the prosecutorâ€™s questions \r\n  violated Petitionerâ€™s right to due process as established in Doyle; (2) \r\n  Petitioner did not in his testimony or the presentation of his defense attempt \r\n  to create the impression that he had cooperated with police, and therefore did \r\n  not open the door to a Doyle violation; and (3) the violation under these \r\n  facts and circumstances was not harmless error and was not cured by the judgeâ€™s \r\n  cautionary instruction.  We reverse Petitionerâ€™s convictions and remand for \r\n  a new trial.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Thomas \r\n  L.

Petitionerâ€™s lawyer objected after \r\n    the prosecutorâ€™s second question.  The Stateâ€™s argument is without merit.  \r\n    See State v. Gray, 304 S.C. 482, 405 S.E.2d 420 (Ct.

Victim apparently was kidnapped on November 12, 1994, \r\n    and murdered a day or two later.

Adams, of \r\n  Atlanta, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  We granted certiorari to review a Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  decision remanding respondentâ€™s appeal to the circuit court with instructions \r\n  to hold a hearing and determine whether information not disclosed by the State \r\n  was material to the defense.  State v. Proctor, 347 S.C. 587, 556 S.E.2d \r\n  418 (Ct. App. 2001).  Because we hold there is no reasonable possibility that, \r\n  had the information sought been disclosed, the result of respondentâ€™s trial \r\n  would have been different, we reverse the Court of Appeals. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was convicted \r\n  of first degree criminal sexual conduct, assault with intent to kill, and possession \r\n  of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.  These convictions arise \r\n  out of a housebreaking and subsequent assault of the victim (â€œJâ€).\r\nThe State proposed to admit DNA test results linking respondent \r\n  to semen recovered from J.  The DNA evidence had been processed at the South \r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) lab.  Respondent sought to discover \r\n  SLEDâ€™s internal DNA proficiency test results in order to explore the possibility \r\n  of challenging the accuracy of the labâ€™s assessments. \r\n  [2]   SLED conducts both â€˜blindâ€™ and â€˜openâ€™ tests; the lab analyst is aware \r\n  of the test in the â€˜openâ€™ situation but not in the â€˜blind.â€™\r\nIn response to respondentâ€™s request for the proficiency test information, \r\n  SLED produced an affidavit from SLED Lt. Ira Jeffcoat that outlined the general \r\n  test procedures, and stated that the SLED examiners have never made an incorrect \r\n  â€˜matchâ€™ in any proficiency test.  At a pretrial hearing, \r\n  [3]  the trial judge denied respondentâ€™s discovery request, finding respondent \r\n  failed to show how the proficiency testing information sought would be relevant \r\n  and material.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in remanding this matter to the trial court?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAs we understand respondentâ€™s \r\n  argument, he seeks the proficiency test results not to attack the methodology \r\n  used or results obtained in his particular case, but as the predicate for his \r\n  expert to derive the SLED DNA labâ€™s â€˜lab error rate.â€™  In turn, respondentâ€™s \r\n  expert would use that rate to evaluate the accuracy of SLEDâ€™s probability estimates.  \r\n  Further, if SLEDâ€™s proficiency test results were not perfect, as represented \r\n  by Lt. Jeffcoat, then they could potentially be used as impeachment evidence.\r\nRespondent contends he is entitled to another hearing to determine \r\n  whether the proficiency test results are material under Brady v. Maryland, \r\n  373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed. 2d 215 (1963), \r\n  [4]  and/or Rule 5(a)(1)(D), SCRCrimP. [5]   The materiality test is the same under Brady \r\n  and under the rule.  State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 503 S.E.2d 214 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d, 337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999).  Evidence \r\n  is material under Brady if there is a reasonable probability that had \r\n  the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  \r\n  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996).  Impeachment \r\n  evidence, as well as evidence that is relevant to guilt or punishment, can be \r\n  material.  Id.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found â€œthe undisclosed proficiency \r\n  test results could very well be material to [respondentâ€™s] case for impeachment \r\n  and important for cross-examination purposesâ€ and remanded so that a circuit \r\n  court judge could reconsider whether to order disclosure of the test results.  \r\n  While we agree that respondentâ€™s original pretrial hearing was flawed, we find \r\n  no error warranting a remand.\r\nWhere a defendant makes a threshold showing that the evidence he \r\n  seeks is material within the meaning of Brady and Rule 5, the trial judge \r\n  should conduct a hearing.  State v. Bryant, 307 S.C. 458, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  806 (1992).  Here, respondent made that showing.  He presented evidence that \r\n  defense experts examining proficiency tests from other labs have found errors \r\n  that demonstrated flaws in the test labâ€™s methodology.  Further, he presented \r\n  evidence that no DNA lab has a â€œzero error rateâ€ on DNA proficiency exams.  \r\n  Having met this threshold requirement, the trial judge should have examined \r\n  the material in camera. [6]   The trial judgeâ€™s reliance on Lt. Jeffcoatâ€™s affidavit in \r\n  lieu of conducting his own in camera examination was error.  State \r\n  v. Bryant, supra (error for trial judge to rely on Stateâ€™s witnessâ€™s \r\n  representation of contents rather than personally inspect materials).\r\nAlthough we conclude that respondent made an adequate threshold showing \r\n  entitling him to a full Bryant hearing, we find that error does not require \r\n  remand:\r\n\r\nFor Brady purposes, in determining the materiality of nondisclosed evidence, \r\n  an appellate court must consider the evidence in the context of the entire record.  \r\n  United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2393, 49 L.Ed. 2d 342 (1976).  \r\n  However, the court should not consider the sufficiency of the evidence.  The \r\n  courtâ€™s function is to determine whether the appellantâ€™s right to a fair trial \r\n  has been impaired.  State v. Osborne, 291 S.C. 265, 353 S.E.2d 276 (1987); \r\n  State v. Goodson, 276 S.C. 243, 277 S.E.2d 602 (1981). \r\nState v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 177, 508 S.E.2d 870, 879 (1998). \r\n\r\nFor purposes of determining \r\n  whether respondent was denied a fair trial, we will assume that the undisclosed \r\n  proficiency tests would have revealed that the SLED DNA lab did not, in fact, \r\n  have a perfect record.  We proceed to consider not just the evidence against \r\n  respondent at trial, but the context in which the DNA evidence was presented.\r\nJ positively identified \r\n  respondent as her assailant.  She testified that the assault lasted approximately \r\n  twenty minutes, and that during that period she had many opportunities to observe \r\n  him.  In a criminal sexual conduct case, the victimâ€™s degree of attention is \r\n  presumably acute.  State v. Gambrell, 274 S.C. 587, 266 S.E.2d 78 (1981).  \r\n  Pubic hairs consistent with respondentâ€™s were recovered from the scene, and \r\n  blood evidence showed the rapist was a Group B secretor.  Respondent is a Group \r\n  B secretor, a trait shared by 9% of whites and 16% of African-Americans. [7]   Finally, J identified a gun recovered when \r\n  respondent was arrested as being similar to the one used by her attacker.  \r\nLt. Jeffcoat testified \r\n  that the SLED lab DNA analysts participated in proficiency tests in order to \r\n  meet certain lab accreditation requirements.  When he began to testify to the \r\n  results of those proficiency tests, respondentâ€™s objection was sustained.  In \r\n  this case, the jury never heard evidence that the SLED lab had a perfect record \r\n  on those tests, and thus respondent was not denied an opportunity to impeach \r\n  Lt. Jeffcoat.  Lt. Jeffcoat testified that the comparison of the DNA samples \r\n  with a sample from respondent resulted in an â€œunprecedentedâ€ match of six out \r\n  of seven probes.  Respondent acknowledges that nothing in the proficiency test \r\n  results would have permitted him to question these results.\r\nFinally, Lt. Jeffcoat was permitted \r\n  to testify that the probabilities of an individual unrelated to respondent having \r\n  the same DNA profile as that found in the semen sample was â€œ1 in 45 billion \r\n  Caucasians, and 1 in 3.7 billion blacks.â€  Had the proficiency test results \r\n  been provided, respondentâ€™s experts could have determined a â€˜lab error rate,â€™ \r\n  and in turn would have testified [8]  to probabilities lower than those testified \r\n  to by Lt. Jeffcoat.\r\nWe find that the nondisclosure \r\n  of proficiency test results was not material.  The other evidence was formidable: \r\n  the test results could only have reduced the probabilities.  Even if the â€˜lab \r\n  error rateâ€™ resulted in a 90% reduction of Lt. Jeffcoatâ€™s probabilities, those \r\n  numbers would still be staggering: 1 in 450 million Caucasians and 1 in 37 million \r\n  African-Americans.  Further, Lt. Jeffcoat acknowledged during his testimony \r\n  that errors are made in every lab, and that those errors affect the validity \r\n  of the probability determination. \r\nRespondent was not denied a \r\n  fair trial because the SLED lab proficiency test results were not disclosed \r\n  to him.  State v. Taylor, supra.  We therefore reverse the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals remanding this matter for further proceedings.\r\n          REVERSED.\r\n          TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We granted certiorari to review a Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n    decision granting respondent this same relief with regard to his convictions \r\n    in Charleston County.  State v. Proctor, 348 S.C. 322, 559 S.E.2d 318 \r\n    (Ct. App. 2001).  In an opinion filed today, we reverse that decision as well.  \r\n    State v. Procter, Op. No. 25810 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 19, 2004)..\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Proficiency tests determine how accurately an \r\n    analyst applies validated technology; their purpose is to determine what difficulties \r\n    a particular examiner may encounter when applying specific methods.  Edward \r\n    J. Imwinkelried, DNA Typing: Emerging or Neglected Issues, 76 Wash. \r\n    L. Rev. 413, 459 (2001).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The pretrial hearing combined respondentâ€™s requests \r\n    made in this case with his requests made in the Charleston County case.  A \r\n    single order was issued addressing both requests.  Accordingly, our analysis \r\n    here mirrors that in our Charleston opinion.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  â€œ[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence \r\n    favorable to the accused upon request violates due process where the evidence \r\n    is material either to guilt or to punishmentâ€¦.â€  Brady, 373 U.S. at \r\n    87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-1197, 10 L.Ed. 2d 215, 218.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  â€œ[U]pon requestâ€¦the prosecution shall permit the \r\n    defendant to inspect and copy any results or reports ofâ€¦scientific tests or \r\n    experimentsâ€¦which are material to preparation of the defenseâ€¦.â€  Rule 5(a)(1)(D), \r\n    SCRCrimP.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  At oral argument, the State contended that the \r\n    raw material respondent sought would be meaningless to the trial judge unless \r\n    he hired his own expert to assist him.  We assume that, in addition to the \r\n    raw data, the materials would include a summary of the results that would \r\n    not require expert interpretation.  Further, the State acknowledged at respondentâ€™s \r\n    pretrial hearing that it had, in fact, given this type of information to a \r\n    circuit court judge in another case.  We are not prepared to say that the \r\n    State can arbitrate whether scientific information is too sophisticated for \r\n    the average trial judge.  Further, Lt. Jeffcoat referred to the proficiency \r\n    testing several times in his testimony establishing the bona fides \r\n    of the SLED DNA lab.  So long as the State relies upon these results to bolster \r\n    the labâ€™s credibility, it should not be surprised that defense counsel will \r\n    seek to look behind its representations.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  Respondent is of mixed Caucasian and African heritage.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  There appears to be a disagreement among experts \r\n    as to the validity or usefulness of a lab error rate.  We will assume for \r\n    purposes of our decision today that this evidence would be admitted, but express \r\n    no final judgment as to this type of evidenceâ€™s admissibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25810","title":"Duncan Proctor v.

Whetstone, Jr., Circuit \r\n  Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25810\r\nHeard December 4, 2003 - Filed April \r\n  19, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n          Attorney General John W.

Adams, of Atlanta, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  We granted certiorari to review a Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  decision remanding respondentâ€™s appeal to the circuit court with instructions \r\n  to hold a hearing and determine whether information not disclosed by the State \r\n  was material to the defense.  State v. Proctor, 348 S.C. 322, 559 S.E.2d \r\n  318 (Ct. App. 2001).  Because we hold that there is no reasonable possibility \r\n  that, had the information sought been disclosed, the result of respondentâ€™s \r\n  trial would have been different, we reverse the Court of Appeals. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was convicted \r\n  of one count of burglary and four counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct \r\n  arising out of an unlawful entry into the victimâ€™s (Gâ€™s) home and sexual \r\n  assaults perpetrated upon her in that home.\r\nThe State proposed to introduce DNA test results linking respondent \r\n  to semen recovered from G.  The DNA evidence had been processed at the South \r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) lab.  Respondent sought to discover \r\n  SLEDâ€™s internal DNA proficiency test results in order to explore the possibility \r\n  of challenging the accuracy of the labâ€™s assessments. [2]   SLED conducts both â€˜blindâ€™ and â€˜openâ€™ tests; \r\n  the lab analyst is aware of the test in the â€˜openâ€™ situation but not in the \r\n  â€˜blind.â€™\r\nIn response to respondentâ€™s request for the proficiency test information, \r\n  SLED produced an affidavit from SLED Lt. Ira Jeffcoat that outlined the general \r\n  test procedures, and stated that the SLED examiners have never made an incorrect \r\n  â€˜matchâ€™ in any proficiency test.  At a pretrial hearing, \r\n  [3]  the trial judge denied respondentâ€™s discovery request, finding respondent \r\n  failed to show how the proficiency testing information sought would be relevant \r\n  and material.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in remanding this matter to the trial court?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAs we understand respondentâ€™s argument, he seeks the proficiency \r\n  test results not to attack the methodology used or results obtained in his particular \r\n  case, but as the predicate for his expert to derive the SLED DNA labâ€™s â€˜lab \r\n  error rate.â€™  In turn, respondentâ€™s expert would use that rate to evaluate the \r\n  accuracy of SLEDâ€™s probability estimates.  In this case, for example, Lt. Jeffcoatâ€™s \r\n  written report states that the probability of an individual unrelated to the \r\n  donor matching the DNA obtained from semen evidence was â€œapproximately 1 \r\n  in 10,000 CAUCASIANS and 1 in 3,700 BLACKS.â€ [4]   Further, if SLEDâ€™s proficiency \r\n  test results were not perfect, as represented by Lt. Jeffcoat, then they could \r\n  potentially be used as impeachment evidence.\r\nRespondent contends he is entitled to another hearing to determine \r\n  whether the proficiency test results are material under Brady v. Maryland, \r\n  373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed. 2d 215 (1963), \r\n  [5]  and/or Rule 5(a)(1)(D), SCRCrimP. [6]   The materiality test is the same under Brady \r\n  and under the rule.  State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 503 S.E.2d 214 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d, 337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999).  Evidence \r\n  is material under Brady if there is a reasonable probability that had \r\n  the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  \r\n  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996).  Impeachment \r\n  evidence, as well as evidence that is relevant to guilt or punishment, can be \r\n  material.  Id.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found â€œthe undisclosed proficiency \r\n  test results could very well be material to [respondentâ€™s] case for impeachment \r\n  and important for cross-examination purposesâ€ and remanded so that a circuit \r\n  court judge could reconsider whether to order disclosure of the test results.  \r\n  While we agree that respondentâ€™s original pretrial hearing was flawed, we find \r\n  no error warranting a remand.\r\nWhere a defendant makes a threshold showing that the evidence he \r\n  seeks is material within the meaning of Brady and Rule 5, the trial judge \r\n  should conduct a hearing.  State v. Bryant, 307 S.C. 458, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  806 (1992).  Here, respondent made that showing.  He presented evidence that \r\n  defense experts examining proficiency tests from other labs have found errors \r\n  that demonstrated flaws in the test labâ€™s methodology.  Further, he presented \r\n  evidence that no DNA lab has a â€œzero error rateâ€ on DNA proficiency exams.  \r\n  Having met this threshold requirement, the trial judge should have examined \r\n  the material in camera. [7]   The trial judgeâ€™s reliance on Lt. Jeffcoatâ€™s affidavit in \r\n  lieu of conducting his own in camera examination was error.  State \r\n  v. Bryant, supra (error for trial judge to rely on Stateâ€™s witnessâ€™s \r\n  representation of contents rather than personally inspect materials).\r\nAlthough we conclude that respondent made an adequate threshold showing \r\n  entitling him to a full Bryant hearing, we find that error does not require \r\n  remand:\r\n\r\nFor Brady purposes, in determining the materiality of nondisclosed evidence, \r\n  an appellate court must consider the evidence in the context of the entire record.  \r\n  United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed. 2d 342 (1976).  \r\n  However, the court should not consider the sufficiency of the evidence.  The \r\n  courtâ€™s function is to determine whether the appellantâ€™s right to a fair trial \r\n  has been impaired.  State v. Osborne, 291 S.C. 265, 353 S.E.2d 276 (1987); \r\n  State v. Goodson, 276 S.C. 243, 277 S.E.2d 602 (1981). \r\nState v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 177, 508 S.E.2d 870, 879 (1998). \r\n\r\nFor purposes of determining \r\n  whether respondent was denied a fair trial, we will assume that the undisclosed \r\n  proficiency tests would have revealed that the SLED DNA lab did not, in fact, \r\n  have a perfect record.  We proceed to consider not just the evidence against \r\n  respondent at trial, but the context in which the DNA evidence was presented.\r\nWhile G was unable \r\n  to make a positive identification, her description of her attackerâ€™s physical \r\n  attributes (height, build, hair color, hair texture) match respondentâ€™s.  Further, \r\n  hair evidence recovered from the scene was consistent with respondentâ€™s, and \r\n  blood evidence showed the rapist was a Group B secretor, as is respondent.  \r\n  This trait is shared by 9% of whites and 16% of African-Americans.  Finally, \r\n  fingerprints identified as respondentâ€™s were found on a window screen at the \r\n  victimâ€™s house at the point of entry, and on a tube of K-Y jelly handled by \r\n  her attacker.  The non-DNA evidence pointing to respondent as the perpetrator \r\n  of these offenses was substantial.\r\nAt trial, Lt. Jeffcoat \r\n  testified that the SLED DNA lab used proficiency testing to ensure its analysts \r\n  were accurate.  He was permitted to testify, over respondentâ€™s objection, â€œIn \r\n  every occasion where we have been provided proficiency tests, weâ€™ve always called \r\n  the correct match.â€  Assuming that the proficiency test results would have shown \r\n  this statement to be untrue, Lt. Jeffcoat could have been impeached by those \r\n  results.  While the lieutenant went on to testify that in this particular case, \r\n  the lab had been able to match four of five probes from samples recovered from \r\n  the scene to samples given by respondent, the witness did not testify to the \r\n  probabilities of such a match occurring in a random population sample.  Accordingly, \r\n  to the extent that respondent sought the proficiency test results in order to \r\n  calculate the â€˜lab error rateâ€™ and then use that rate to discount the probability \r\n  match, he cannot demonstrate prejudice from the denial of that information since \r\n  no â€˜matchâ€™ evidence was presented to the jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRespondent made the threshold showing entitling him to a Bryant \r\n  hearing and an in camera inspection by the trial judge of the proficiency \r\n  test results.  We assume those results would have reflected adversely on the \r\n  SLED DNA labâ€™s performance, and that Lt. Jeffcoat could have been impeached \r\n  on his statement that the lab was always correct.  We hold, however, that respondent \r\n  has not demonstrated that he was denied a fair trial.  State v. Taylor, \r\n  supra.  We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals remanding \r\n  the matter for further proceedings.\r\nREVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We granted certiorari to review a Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n    decision granting respondent the same relief with regard to his convictions \r\n    in Dorchester County.

Peeples, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25811\r\nHeard March 17, 2004 - Filed April 19, \r\n  2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCharles L. Henshaw, Jr., of Furr, Henshaw &amp; Ohanesian, of Columbia, for \r\n  Appellant.\r\nDavid E. Dukes, Clarence Davis, and John D. Martin, \r\n  all of Nelson, Mullins, Riley and Scarborough, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:  This is a strict \r\n  liability case.  The issue on appeal is whether a pharmacy may be held strictly \r\n  liable for the distribution of a prescription drug which was filled in accordance \r\n  with a physicianâ€™s orders.  The circuit court granted summary judgment to Respondent, \r\n  Aiken Drug Company (Aiken).  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nShirley Madison, a physician,  began taking \r\n  the drug Effexor on September 25, 1998, which was prescribed for chronic depression.  \r\n  She took it as prescribed through September 29, 1998, at which time she assaulted \r\n  her seven-year-old son  and attempted suicide at her home in Aiken County.\r\nThereafter, she instituted this suit against \r\n  American Home Products Corporation (AHP), the company which formulated and marketed \r\n  Effexor, and Aiken, the pharmacy which filled the prescription.  She alleged \r\n  causes of action in negligence (against AHP only), strict liability, and breach \r\n  of warranty.  Aiken filed a Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss, contending \r\n  Madison had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted against \r\n  it.  The trial court agreed and dismissed the strict liability and breach of \r\n  warranty claims against Aiken.  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err in granting \r\n  Aikenâ€™s motion to dismiss the strict liability cause of action?  [1] \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nInitially, Madison claims that since the \r\n  issue is novel, it should not have been decided on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \r\n  dismiss.  We disagree.  \r\nAs a general rule, important questions \r\n  of novel impression should not be decided on a motion to dismiss.  Where, however, \r\n  the dispute is not as to the underlying facts but as to the interpretation of \r\n  the law, and development of the record will not aid in the resolution of the \r\n  issues, it is proper to decide even novel issues on a motion to dismiss.  Unysis \r\n  Corp. v. South Carolina Budget and Control Bd. Div. of Gen. Servs., 346 \r\n  S.C. 158, 551 S.E.2d 263 (2001).  We find development of the record unnecessary \r\n  as the present case presents the purely legal issue of whether a pharmacy may \r\n  be held strictly liable for properly filling a prescription drug in accordance \r\n  with a physicianâ€™s orders. Cf. Unysis Corp., supra (constitutional \r\n  challenges to Procurement Code proceeding properly resolved on Rule 12(b)(6) \r\n  motion where there were no factual issues in need of further development); In \r\n  re Breast Implant Product Liability Litigation, 331 S.C. 540, 554, 503 S.E.2d \r\n  445, 451, n. 2 (1998) (certiorari granted to review denial of defendantâ€™s motion \r\n  to dismiss claim of strict liability of physician for use of breast implant \r\n  devices).   Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s resolution of \r\n  the issue pursuant to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Further, under the facts of this \r\n  case, we hold the trial court properly dismissed Madisonâ€™s strict liability \r\n  claim.\r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s strict liability statute, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 (1976)  (the Defective Products Act), provides, in \r\n  pertinent part: \r\n\r\nOne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably \r\n  dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability \r\n  for physical harm caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, \r\n  if\r\n(a) The seller is engaged in the business of selling such \r\n  a product, and\r\n(b) It is expected to and does reach the user or consumer \r\n  without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.\r\n(2) The rule stated in subsection (1) shall apply although\r\n(a) The seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation \r\n  and sale of his product, and\r\n(b) The user or consumer has not bought the product from or \r\n  entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\r\n\r\nMadison asserts that since a pharmacy â€œsellsâ€ prescription \r\n  drugs, and Â§ 15-73-10 does not specifically exempt them as sellers, they are \r\n  strictly liable for the sale of prescription drugs.  We disagree.\r\nIn In re Breast Implant Product Liability \r\n  Litigation, supra, we addressed the liability of health care providers \r\n  for the use of medical devices, such as breast implants.  We found the determinative \r\n  issue in the case was whether a health care provider, such as a hospital or \r\n  a doctor, is a â€œsellerâ€ within the meaning of Â§ 15-73-10.  We rejected the plaintiffsâ€™ \r\n  claim that, because Â§ 15-73-10 did not specifically exempt â€œhealth care providers,â€ \r\n  they were strictly liable as â€œsellers.â€  After recognizing that Â§ 15-73-10 applies \r\n  only to products and not to services, we found health care providers who perform \r\n  breast implant procedures, offer services rather than products stating:\r\n\r\nAlthough the breast implant procedure requires the \r\n  use of a product, the implant, the health care provider is fundamentally and \r\n  predominantly offering a service.  The provider must have medical knowledge \r\n  and skill to conduct the procedure.  He must advise the patient of the medical \r\n  consequences and must recommend to the patient the preferable type of procedure.  \r\n  The product may not be purchased independently of the service.  One does not \r\n  &quot;buy&quot; a breast implant procedure in the same way as one would buy \r\n  a product, such as a lawnmower.  At its heart, the breast implant procedure \r\n  is a service and not a product.\r\n\r\n331 S.C. at 547, 503 S.E.2d at \r\n  448-449.  The In re Breast Implant Litigation Court went on to survey \r\n  a number of jurisdictions which hold health care professionals and institutions \r\n  are providers of services, rather than sellers of products, for purposes of \r\n  strict liability, because the provision of medical services is qualitatively \r\n  different from the sale of products.  We find this analysis applies with equal \r\n  force to services of a pharmacist in properly filling a prescription in accordance \r\n  with a physicianâ€™s instructions.   \r\nOther jurisdictions have reached similar \r\n  conclusions.  In Murphy v. E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc., 710 P.2d 247 \r\n  (Cal. 1985), the California Supreme Court affirmed the grant of judgment on \r\n  the pleadings to a pharmacy which had sold the drug DES to the plaintiffâ€™s mother; \r\n  the court held a pharmacy may not be held strictly liable for dispensing a prescription \r\n  drug.  The court addressed only the duties of a pharmacist as they relate to \r\n  filling prescription drugs on the order of a physician, and only when the pharmacist \r\n  has used due care in compounding and labeling the drug.  The court engaged in \r\n  a lengthy discussion of the distinctions and similarities between pharmacists \r\n  and ordinary retailers, noting that â€œ[a] key factor is that the pharmacist who \r\n  fills a prescription is in a different position from the ordinary retailer because \r\n  he cannot offer a prescription for sale except by order of the doctor.â€ 710 \r\n  P.2d at 251.  While noting that a â€œsaleâ€ does, in fact, occur in the case of \r\n  prescription drugs, the court nonetheless concluded pharmacies are immune from \r\n  strict liability, stating:\r\n\r\nIf pharmacies were held strictly liable for the drugs they \r\n  dispense, some of them, to avoid liability, might restrict availability by refusing \r\n  to dispense drugs which pose even a potentially remote risk of harm, although \r\n  such medications may be essential to the health or even the survival of patients. \r\n  Furthermore, in order to assure that a pharmacy receives the maximum protection \r\n  in the event of suit for defects in a drug, the pharmacist may select the more \r\n  expensive product made by an established manufacturer when he has a choice of \r\n  several brands of the same drug. \r\n\r\nId. at 253.   We find the present case analogous \r\n  to Murphy. [2]   \r\nHere S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-43-10 (the South Carolina \r\n  Pharmacy Practice Act), specifically states that â€œ[t]he practice of pharmacy \r\n  shall center around the provision of pharmacy care services and assisting \r\n  the patient to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.â€  Similarly, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 40-43-30(23) defines &quot;health care provider&quot; to include a pharmacist \r\n  who provides health care services within the pharmacist's scope of practice \r\n  pursuant to state law and regulation.â€   Given our holding in In re Breast \r\n  Implant Product Liability Litigation that â€œhealth care providersâ€ are engaged \r\n  in a service, we find the same analysis applies here to relieve pharmacists \r\n  of strict liability.  \r\nConsistent with this approach, most courts \r\n  addressing the issue have declined to extend strict liability to pharmacies.  \r\n  As the Utah Supreme Court recently stated:\r\n\r\n[S]trict liability for manufacturers exists in large part \r\n  as a deterrent and a method of allocating the risk of loss among those best \r\n  equipped to deal with it. Compounding pharmacies provide a unique and valuable \r\n  service in our health care system, one which we have no reason to deter at this \r\n  point. Nor do we believe that pharmacies are in a good position to insure against, \r\n  or take steps to reduce the risk of, harm done by the drugs used in their compounded \r\n  products through additional warnings. So long as the pharmacy is acting within \r\n  the rules and regulations set forth by the state and federal governments for \r\n  the practice of pharmacy, providing compounded drug products to patients after \r\n  receipt of a physician's prescription, and confining themselves to the traditional \r\n  scope of pharmaceutical care, we need not shift the pharmacy into the category \r\n  of drug manufacturer for the purpose of strict products liability.\r\n\r\nSchaerrer v. Stewart's Plaza Pharmacy, Inc., \r\n  79 P.3d 922, 932 (Utah 2003).  See also In re New York County Diet \r\n  Drug Litig., 262 A.D.2d 132, 133, 691 N.Y.S.2d 501, 502 (1st Dept. 1999) \r\n  (where no allegation pharmacist failed to fill prescriptions precisely as directed, \r\n  no basis to hold pharmacists liable under theories of negligence, breach of \r\n  warranty or strict liability); Kohl v. Am. Home Prods. Corp., 78 F.Supp.2d \r\n  885 (W.D. Ark 1999)(holding pharmacists immune from strict liability).\r\nIn addition to the theory that filling a prescription \r\n  is more of a service than a sale, courts have found no basis to impose strict \r\n  liability on pharmacists because â€œnegligence theories provide adequate consumer \r\n  protection; strict liability is inconsistent with the learned intermediary doctrine, \r\n  which places the duty to warn on the prescribing physicians, and not pharmacists;  \r\n  the imposition of such duties would force pharmacists to refuse to stock necessary \r\n  drugs because of risks involved, refuse to use less expensive generic drugs, \r\n  or second guess the judgment of prescribing physicians; and that permitting \r\n  strict liability would run counter to a specific exception [comment k] in the \r\n  commentary to the restatement provision [Restatement (Second) of Torts, Â§ 402(A)].â€ \r\n  [3]   David J. Marchitelli, Liability of Pharmacist Who Accurately Fills \r\n  Prescription for Harm Resulting to User, 44 A.L.R. 5th 393, 419, Â§ 2(a)(1996).  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that because the pharmacy is providing \r\n  a service, rather than selling a product,  it may not be held strictly liable \r\n  for properly filling a prescription in accordance with a physicianâ€™s orders.  \r\n  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Aiken is affirmed.  \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]   Madison does not contest dismissal of the breach of warranty action.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   The Murphy court was persuaded by the \r\n    fact that the California Legislature had provided pharmacies are a â€œdynamic \r\n    patient oriented health service.â€  710 P.2d at 252.  (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   Pursuant to comment k of Â§ 402(A) of the \r\n    Restatement (Second) of Torts, a seller of an â€œunavoidably unsafeâ€ product \r\n    is not held strictly liable.  Comment k states, in part, â€œa product \r\n    which is incapable of being made safe for its intended  and ordinary use, \r\n    is not considered either defective or unreasonably dangerous, if the product \r\n    is properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning.â€  \r\n    Comment k specifically states, â€œIt is . . . true in particular of many \r\n    new or experimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity \r\n    for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, . \r\n    . . but such experience as there is justifies the use and marketing and use \r\n    of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk.  The seller of \r\n    such products. . .  is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate \r\n    consequences attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply \r\n    the public with an apparently useful and desirable product. . .â€  Here, in \r\n    light of our holding that a pharmacist is not strictly liable for properly \r\n    filling a prescription drug in accordance with a physicianâ€™s orders, we need \r\n    not determine whether Effexor would be considered an â€œunavoidably unsafeâ€ \r\n    product, so as to relieve all sellers of strict liability.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25812","title":"Peoples Federal Savings and Loan v.

Scott, II, Business Assets Trust, Jane Martin Smith, and \r\n  James Harrison Whitner, IV, Trustee.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:  Appellant/Respondent Peoples Federal \r\n  Savings and Loan Association of South Carolina (Peoples) filed this action seeking \r\n  a declaration of its rights and interests as the successful bidder at the foreclosure \r\n  sale of 30 acres of undeveloped property located within Litchfield Plantation.  \r\n  In addition, it alleged the defendants, Respondents/Appellants Resources Planning \r\n  Corporation (RPC), Litchfield Plantation Company, Inc. (LPC), and Litchfield \r\n  Plantation Association (LPA), conspired to injure the marketability of the purchased \r\n  property through improper assessments and initiation fees.  Peoples sought actual \r\n  and punitive damages.  The defendants filed various counterclaims.\r\nAfter a merits hearing, the Special Referee \r\n  determined Peoples acquired the foreclosed property subject to the same rights \r\n  and limitations (including the payment of assessment fees) as any other purchaser \r\n  of undeveloped Plantation property, but that RPC, LPC, and LPA had conspired \r\n  to injure Peoples by destroying the marketability of its property and depreciating \r\n  the value of its property through improper means.  The referee awarded Peoples \r\n  actual and punitive damages as a result of the conspiracy and awarded RPC, LPC, \r\n  and LPA contract damages.  The referee set off the monetary awards, leaving \r\n  a net award to Peoples of $161,816 actual damages on its conspiracy claim against \r\n  RPC, LPC, and LPA, and $441,050 in punitive damages against RPC and LPC.  The \r\n  parties have filed cross-appeals.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nLPC was formed in the 1960s for the purpose of developing \r\n  600-acre Litchfield Plantation as a private residential development in Pawleyâ€™s \r\n  Island.  In 1971, LPC recorded a Declaration of Restrictive Covenants to facilitate \r\n  the development of Phase I of the project.  The Covenants reserved to LPC significant \r\n  rights as the developer, including rights to approve certain uses in the Plantation \r\n  and exclusion from payment of any assessments by a property ownersâ€™ association.  \r\n  The Plantation and the property to which the Covenants were applicable were \r\n  described on a recorded plat which was incorporated by reference into the Covenants.  \r\n\r\nThe Covenants mandate the formation of \r\n  LPA which serves as the property ownersâ€™ association for the Plantation.  Each \r\n  purchaser of property within Phase I is an automatic member of LPA.  The Covenants \r\n  require LPA to operate and maintain the common elements and impose upon LPA \r\n  the duty to levy and collect assessments against certain property owners within \r\n  Phase I to defray the cost.  The Covenants specify:  â€œ[e]ach purchaser of any \r\n  lot . . . within Phase I, shall, by acceptance of a deed or other conveyance, \r\n  be deemed to agree to pay [LPA] an annual assessment or charge to be fixed, \r\n  established and collected from time to time as hereinafter provided.â€  The only \r\n  property exempt from assessments are properties owned or leased by LPC, LPA, \r\n  and all property owned by their affiliates, subsidiaries, and paid employees. \r\n\r\nThe Covenants contain a specific provision \r\n  making the Covenants and LPAâ€™s by-laws binding upon all owners within Phase \r\n  I.  In addition, the Covenants contain a provision making duly adopted amendments \r\n  to the Covenants binding upon future owners of property subject to the amendment.  \r\n\r\nIn June 1971, LPC recorded master deeds \r\n  for two condominium regimes in the Plantation.  The sale of residential lots \r\n  followed.  Each deed to a condominium and to a residential lot was made subject \r\n  to the Covenants.  The purchasers became members of the LPA and became obligated \r\n  to pay assessments levied by the LPA.&nbsp; \r\n In the mid-1970s, LPC suffered severe \r\n  financial hardship and underwent statutory reorganization.  RPC became the â€œfinancial \r\n  advisorâ€ to LPC; RPC entered into a management contract with LPA.  Donald Parsons \r\n  is CEO of RPC; his children own all the stock in RPC.  LPCâ€™s stock is held almost \r\n  entirely by Parsonsâ€™ wife, Louise Parsons.  Donald Parsons serves on the board \r\n  of directors for RPC, LPC, and LPA.  Allan Kidston is an employee of RPC, a \r\n  board member of LPA, and president of RPC, LPC, and LPA. \r\nPrior to 1985, RPC acquired property in \r\n  Phase I of the Plantation.  Thereafter, Peoples loaned RPC $1,000,000.  The \r\n  loan was secured by personal guaranties, a mortgage from RPC on real estate \r\n  within Phase I, and an accomodation mortgage from LPC on real estate within \r\n  Phase I.  In 1986, RPC negotiated a $400,000 loan from Peoples.  The loan was \r\n  secured by personal guaranties and an accommodation mortgage from LPC on real \r\n  estate within Phase I.  \r\nIn 1984, the independent homeowners (those not affiliated \r\n  with RPC or LPC), filed suit against LPC and LPA.  A 1988 Settlement Agreement \r\n  provided for various changes in and additions to the Covenants, including a \r\n  ten year limitation on RPCâ€™s and LPCâ€™s voting control over LPA.  Significantly, \r\n  the agreement required RPC and LPC to designate at the time of sale the numbers \r\n  of units within any area of undeveloped property in Phase I which was sold for \r\n  development.  The 1988 Agreement provided the developer (specifically defined \r\n  as RPC, LPC, and their successors and assigns) would pay a â€œdevelopersâ€™ assessmentâ€ \r\n  of 20% of LPAâ€™s budget for ten years at the end of which the developers would \r\n  make a final designation of total density on their undeveloped property and \r\n  begin paying monthly assessments.  During the ten year period, RPC and LPC were \r\n  entitled to repayment if LPA had a budget surplus.  \r\nBetween 1989 and 1995, Peoples extended both loans \r\n  on several occasions, however, Peoplesâ€™ loans to RPC ultimately went into default \r\n  and Peoples instituted an action to foreclose both mortgages.  Peoples waived \r\n  deficiency judgment on each loan.  The Master-in-Equity entered an Amended Masterâ€™s \r\n  Report and an Amended Order of Sale pursuant to which he sold the real estate \r\n  covered by the mortgages, approximately 30 undeveloped acres, at public sale \r\n  on January 5, 1998.  Peoples was the successful bidder; it purchased the property \r\n  for $1,337,000.  The master executed and delivered his deed to Peoples and the \r\n  sale was confirmed by order on January 12, 1998.  RPC, LPC, LPA, Donald Parsons, \r\n  and Kidston appealed the masterâ€™s order of foreclosure.  The Court of Appeals \r\n  affirmed.  Peoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. of S.C. v. Resources Planning \r\n  Corp., Op. No. 99-UP-118 (Ct. App. 1999).  \r\nAt or about the time of the foreclosure sale, RPC/LPC \r\n  hired a commercial real estate appraiser to conduct a financial analysis of \r\n  the property acquired by Peoples.  The appraiserâ€™s report was generated based \r\n  on 1) RPC/LPCâ€™s stated authority to control the development of the 30 acres \r\n  and 2) monthly assessments on 120 units and an $1800 per unit initiation fee.  \r\n  The report details the expected annual costs which would be incurred by Peoples \r\n  â€œuntil all legal questions have been resolved.â€  \r\nSometime after the foreclosure sale, RPC and LPC designated \r\n  a minimum of 120 assessable units and a maximum of 140 assessable units on the \r\n  property acquired by Peoples.  LPC notified LPA of the designation.  On May \r\n  12, 1998, the LPA board, including Donald Parsons and Kidston, unanimously resolved \r\n  to establish an initiation fee of $1800 per unit for all new members, retroactive \r\n  to January 1, 1998.  They further resolved to assess Peoples monthly assessments \r\n  pro rata from January 6, 1998, on 120 units at the rate of $148.50 per unit.  \r\n  The following day, LPA informed Peoples of the $302,000 in charges. \r\n  [1]   Peoples claimed the assessments and initiation fees were unenforceable \r\n  and refused to remit payment.  [2]   Peoples instituted this litigation late in \r\n  1998.  By the time of trial, Peoples had not sold or developed any part of the \r\n  property. \r\nIn December 1998, RPC, LPC, and most of the other property \r\n  owners, excluding Peoples, executed an agreement modifying the 1988 Agreement.  \r\n  The modification extended the 1998 deadline for ending developer control of \r\n  LPA for three years or until the end of litigation with Peoples.  While the \r\n  extension was in effect, RPC and LPC were entitled to repayment of their loans \r\n  to LPA if LPA generated a budget surplus. [3]    \r\nOne month before trial, LPA issued a statement to Peoples \r\n  requesting payment of $4,012,928 representing monthly homeownerâ€™s assessments, \r\n  initiation fees of $216,000, late charges, and interest.  Two weeks later, LPA \r\n  issued a revised statement, deleting the initiation fees and late charges thereon.  \r\n  The revised statement reflected assessments and late charges of $2,254,628.  \r\n  Five days prior to trial in May 2000, a second revised statement reduced the \r\n  assessments and late charges to $614,256. \r\nSince 1985, LPC has not sold any new \r\n  lots or condominiums, but it has exercised the right of first refusal provided \r\n  in the 1971 Covenants to reacquire many of the lots and condominiums previously \r\n  sold.  By the time of trial in the current case (May 2000), LPC had sold 53 \r\n  condominium or single family residential lots even though the Plantation had \r\n  the capacity to develop 800 units.  Less than thirty of the sold properties \r\n  were purchased by individuals not affiliated with RPC, LPC, or Louise Parsons.  \r\n\r\nIn his final order, the referee concluded, as a purchaser \r\n  of 30 acres of undeveloped property in Phase I of the Plantation, Peoples was \r\n  subject to assessments imposed by LPA pursuant to the 1988 Amendments.  The \r\n  referee concluded, however, the 120-unit designation was untimely, improper, \r\n  or illegal.  Accordingly, the referee imposed a 2-unit designation on each of \r\n  the 30 acres purchased by Peoples based on the minimum designation established \r\n  by the 1988 Amendments. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the referee err by finding evidence of a conspiracy?  \r\n II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the referee impose improper awards of actual and punitive damages? \r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDid the referee err by denying LPAâ€™s Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss?  \r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDid the referee err by ruling on the validity of the right of first refusal \r\n  provision in the Covenants?  \r\n   V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the referee err by determining Peoples did not become a\r\n  co-developer with RPC/LPC when it \r\n  acquired the Plantation property at the foreclosure sale? \r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEvidence of Conspiracy \r\n   \r\nRPC, LPC, and Louise P. Parsons \r\n  assert the referee erred by  finding the existence of a conspiracy.  More specifically, \r\n  they claim because LPC was contractually required to designate a number of units \r\n  under the terms of the 1988 Amendments to the Covenants, there is no evidence \r\n  the defendants intended to harm Peoples.  We disagree.  \r\nA civil conspiracy is a combination \r\n  of two or more parties joined for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and \r\n  thereby causing special damage.  Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 \r\n  S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996).  Conspiracy may be inferred from the very nature \r\n  of the acts done, the relationship of the parties, the interests of the alleged \r\n  conspirators, and other circumstances.  Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, \r\n  292 S.C. 595, 3538 S.E.2d 150 (Ct. App. 1987).  â€œCivil conspiracy is an act \r\n  which is by its very nature covert and clandestine and usually not susceptible \r\n  of proof by direct evidence. . . .â€  Id. at 601, S.E.2d at 153.  An action \r\n  for civil conspiracy is an action at law; the trial judgeâ€™s findings will be \r\n  upheld on appeal unless they are without evidentiary support.  Gynecology \r\n  Clinic v. Cloer, 334 S.C. 555, 514 S.E.2d 592 (1999). \r\nIn relevant part, the 1988 Amendments \r\n  provide:\r\n\r\nSale of Undeveloped Parcel:  In the event the \r\n  Developer sells an undeveloped parcel of land for purposes of development (an \r\n  â€œUndeveloped Parcelâ€) to a party not related to the Developer (the â€œUnrelated \r\n  Builderâ€) for development into Units, the Developer shall designate a maximum \r\n  and a minimum number of Units to be available and of votes to be assigned to \r\n  that particular Undeveloped Parcel at the time of sale.  In no event shall the \r\n  number of assessments to be paid by the Unrelated Builder be less than two times \r\n  the number of acres of buildable high ground acres in the Undeveloped Parcel.   \r\n\r\n\r\nWe disagree with RPC/LPCâ€™s premise \r\n  that LPC was contractually obligated to designate a number of units under the \r\n  terms of the 1988 Amendments.  Instead, the 1988 Amendments specifically required \r\n  RPC/LPC to designate the number of assessable units on undeveloped property \r\n  â€œat the time of sale.â€  The 1988 Amendments did not authorize RPC/LPC to designate \r\n  a number of units for assessment purposes four months after the sale of undeveloped \r\n  property.  \r\nIn any event, the referee found \r\n  the following facts constituted direct and/or circumstantial evidence of RPC \r\n  and LPCâ€™s intent and motive to harm Peoples by imposing the 120 unit designation:  \r\n  1) RPC and LPC unsuccessfully defended the foreclosure suit; 2) RPC and LPC \r\n  were unable to post bond to stay the foreclosure sale; 3) at the time of the \r\n  foreclosure, RPC hired a real estate appraiser who detailed Peoplesâ€™ expected \r\n  losses over a several year period using the proposed unit designation and initiation \r\n  fee if Peoples refused to submit to RPC/LPCâ€™s control; 4) RPC and LPC proposed \r\n  a density designation, but concealed the designation from Peoples for more than \r\n  four months after the foreclosure sale; 5) the designation created an opportunity \r\n  for RPC and LPC to buy the distressed property back from Peoples for a fraction \r\n  of its original cost; 6) RPC and LPC stood to directly benefit from the 120-unit \r\n  assessment as the two were required to make up LPAâ€™s budgetary shortfall; and \r\n  7) RPC/LPC notified Peoples of the $302,000 charge during a settlement conference \r\n  concerning two other pending actions between Peoples and RPC/LPC.  The record \r\n  is replete with evidence establishing RPC/LPCâ€™s motive and intent to injure \r\n  Peoples.  Accordingly, the Court is required to affirm the refereeâ€™s findings \r\n  of fact.  Id.   \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDamages \r\n   \r\nA. &nbsp;&nbsp; Actual Damages\r\nThe referee awarded Peoples damages based on his determination \r\n  the â€œclaimed assessments depreciated the present value of Peoplesâ€™ property \r\n  and created a reasonable probability of litigation which destroyed its marketability.â€  \r\n  The referee awarded Peoples $749,767 in actual damages based on two categories \r\n  of damages:  1) $454,959 representing the diminution in present value of the \r\n  property and 2) $294,808 representing Peoplesâ€™ holding costs for the 30 acres \r\n  during the period of the conspiracy.  \r\nIn a conspiracy action, what is required is proof of \r\n  the fact of damages, not certainty of amount.  Charles v. Texas Co., \r\n  199 S.C. 156, 18 S.E.2d 719 (1942).  â€œThe elements which go to make up such \r\n  damages must depend on the nature of the act and the injury.â€  Id.  S.C. \r\n  at 174, S.E.2d at 726 internal citation omitted.  \r\n1.   Diminution \r\n  in Value\r\nLPA contends the referee erred by awarding \r\n  actual damages based on the diminution in market value of Peoplesâ€™ property.  \r\n  Relying on Yadkin Brick Co., Inc. v. Materials Recovery Co., 339 S.C. \r\n  640, 529 S.E.2d 764 (Ct. App. 2000), and opinions from Texas and Ohio, LPA asserts \r\n  damages for the temporary, non-physical injury to property is limited to the \r\n  loss of rental value during the time of the temporary injury.  We disagree. \r\n\r\nIn Yadkin Brick Co., Inc. v. Materials \r\n  Recovery Co., id., the Court of Appeals held diminution in market \r\n  value is an appropriate measure of damages where there is injury of a permanent \r\n  nature to real property.  Where the injury is temporary, the landowner can recover \r\n  the depreciation in the rental or usable value of the property caused by the \r\n  injury.\r\n Yadkin Brick, id., concerns \r\n  the appropriate measure of damages where there is physical injury to real property.  \r\n  Here, Peoples suffered economic injury.  Accordingly, Yadkin Brick is \r\n  inapplicable.      \r\n Seelbach v. Clubb, 7 S.W.3d 749 (1999 \r\n  Ct. App. Tex.), and Hall v. Robbins, 790 S.W.2d 417 (1990 Ct. App. Tex.), \r\n  involved the temporary loss of use of land due to blocked access to the property.  \r\n  In both cases, the Texas Court of Appeals held the rental value of the land \r\n  was an appropriate measure of damages under the circumstances.  The Texas courts \r\n  noted the lease value or rental value of the land was not the only appropriate \r\n  measure of damages which can be awarded for the temporary loss of use of land.  \r\n  Relying on the earlier Texas decision, in Henderson v. Spring Run Allotment, \r\n  651 N.E.2d 489, 497 (Ohio App. 1994), the Ohio court held lost profits were \r\n  the appropriate measure of damage â€œunder [the] circumstancesâ€ where plaintiffs \r\n  discharged untreated sewage prevented defendant from selling the residential \r\n  lots.  \r\n The referee did not abuse his discretion \r\n  by fashioning damages on the diminution in value of Peoplesâ€™ property during \r\n  the pendency of the assessments, initiation fees, and ensuing litigation.  The \r\n  refereeâ€™s damage award recognizes the temporary loss in value of Peoplesâ€™ 30 \r\n  acres as a result of the retroactive imposition of 120 units worth of assessments \r\n  and initiation fees months after its purchase of the property.  The refereeâ€™s \r\n  award attempts to restore Peoples to the â€œbenefit of the bargainâ€ at the time \r\n  of its purchase in January 1998.  Considering the nature of the conspiracy and \r\n  its resulting injury to Peoples, the refereeâ€™s attempt to base the actual damage \r\n  award on Peoplesâ€™ special injury is appropriate.  Charles v. Texas Co., \r\n  supra.  This result is in accord with the Texas and Ohio cases referenced \r\n  by LPA which state the appropriate measure of damages should be determined by \r\n  the circumstances.\r\n2. &nbsp; Martin \r\n  Letter\r\nLPA contends the referee erred by using the \r\n  â€œMartin Letterâ€ to extrapolate the diminution in value of Peoplesâ€™ property \r\n  because 1) the letter was inadmissible as a part of settlement negotiations \r\n  and 2) it did not address diminution in value.  We disagree.\r\nOver LPAâ€™s objection, the referee admitted \r\n  the June 4, 1998 letter prepared by certified appraiser Robert S. Martin.  As \r\n  stated in the letter, RPC hired Martin to prepare a financial analysis of Peoplesâ€™ \r\n  property as of January 1, 1996, and for the next three years.  The report is \r\n  an appraisal of the value of Peoplesâ€™ investment considering assessments and \r\n  initiation fees for 120 units and RPCâ€™s right to control and veto the construction \r\n  on the property.  It is undisputed the Martin report was requested by RPC to \r\n  assist it in settlement negotiations with Peoples during the appeal of the foreclosure \r\n  action and lender liability suit.  \r\nRule 408, SCRE, provides that evidence of \r\n  offers or acceptances of settlement â€œis not admissible to prove liability for \r\n  or invalidity of the claim or its amount.â€  \r\nWhile the Martin letter provides an estimate \r\n  of value of Peoplesâ€™ property, the Martin letter was not evidence of an offer \r\n  of settlement.  Instead, the report was produced to assist RPC in its own evaluation \r\n  of settlement of the foreclosure and lender liability suits.  It did not constitute \r\n  evidence of an offer of settlement.  \r\nMoreover, the referee adopted the model, \r\n  not the actual data, used by Martin to determine the value of Peoplesâ€™ property.  \r\n  Using Martinâ€™s model, the referee projected the value of Peoplesâ€™ property based \r\n  on assessments and initiation fees of 120 and 60 units.  From these results, \r\n  the referee extrapolated the diminution in value of Peoplesâ€™ property.  The \r\n  admission of the letter was not an abuse of discretion.  Gamble v. Intâ€™l \r\n  Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996) (admission or exclusion \r\n  of evidence within sound discretion of trial court and, absent clear abuse, \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal).  \r\n3. &nbsp; Cost \r\n  of Carry/Holding Costs\r\nLPA argues the referee erred by awarding Peoples holding \r\n  costs.  Alternatively, it asserts the referee allowed Peoples a double recovery \r\n  because the costs of carry were included in the discount rate. \r\nHolding costs are expenses such as insurance or taxes \r\n  associated with â€œcarryingâ€ property over a period of time.  Peoples Fed. \r\n  Sav. and Loan Assâ€™n v. Myrtle Beach Retirement Group, Inc., 302 S.C. 223, \r\n  394 S.E.2d 849 (Ct. App. 1990).  We conclude holding costs are appropriate. \r\n  The referee did not abuse his discretion by awarding these costs to Peoples.  \r\n  Gynecology Clinic v. Cloer, supra.  \r\nNevertheless, the award appears to provide Peoples \r\n  with double recovery of its holding costs.  As noted above, in order to determine \r\n  Peoplesâ€™ actual damages, the referee adopted the model provided in the June \r\n  4, 1998 report of RPCâ€™s appraiser.  The appraiserâ€™s report includes the carrying \r\n  costs associated with Peoplesâ€™ retaining the 30 acres (i.e., the 120 unit monthly \r\n  assessment, the per unit initiation fee, property taxes, and insurance) while \r\n  the parties debated permissible development of the property.  The model applies \r\n  a 12% discount rate, representing the market return expected by a residential \r\n  real estate developer, to determine the present value of Peoplesâ€™ property.  \r\n  Since the model already includes Peoplesâ€™ holding costs, permitting Peoples \r\n  to earn an additional 6.3% cost of money for its costs of carry, the referee \r\n  permitted a double recovery.  \r\nB.  Punitive \r\n  Damages\r\nLPA argues it was subject to RPC \r\n  and LPCâ€™s control (by voting control, the Covenants, and 1988 Amendments), and \r\n  therefore, there was no evidence it acted willfully.  Accordingly, LPA asserts \r\n  the award of punitive damages must be reversed.  We disagree.  \r\nThere is clear and convincing evidence LPA acted willfully \r\n  in imposing the 120 unit assessments and initiation fee on Peoples. \r\n  [4]   Although governed by the 1971 Covenants and 1988 Assessments and subject \r\n  to the voting control of LPC, LPA, a non-profit corporation, was not authorized \r\n  to act improperly, much less illegally, as found by the referee.  LPA was not \r\n  entitled to assess the 120 unit fee even though so instructed by LPC.  Furthermore, \r\n  LPA, on its own initiative, imposed the retroactive initiation fee.  LPAâ€™s imposition \r\n  of the 120 lot assessment and initiation fees constitutes clear and convincing \r\n  evidence which supports a punitive damages award.  \r\nIII.  \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP\r\nLPA argues the referee erred by denying \r\n  its Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss Peoplesâ€™ complaint for failure to \r\n  state a cause of action for conspiracy.  LPA asserts Peoplesâ€™ conspiracy claim \r\n  is simply a restatement of its breach of fiduciary duty claim and fails to allege \r\n  any special damages resulting from the conspiracy.  We disagree.\r\nA plaintiff cannot recover damages for a particular \r\n  act or wrong and likewise recover on a conspiracy to do the act or wrong.  See \r\n  Todd v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 276 S.C. 284, 278 S.E.2d \r\n  607 (1981), revâ€™d on other grds. 287 S.C. 190, 336 \r\n  S.E.2d 472 (1985); Vaught v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201, 387 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989); See F. Hubbard and R. Felix, The South Carolina Law of \r\n  Torts 2d ed. (1997) (authors suggest Todd v. South Carolina Farm Bureau \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., supra, limited to proposition that plaintiff can only \r\n  recover damages once and must elect remedy).  \r\n The damages alleged in Peoplesâ€™ breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty and conspiracy claims are similar.  However, since the referee directed \r\n  the verdict in favor of LPA on Peoplesâ€™ breach of fiduciary duty claim, LPA \r\n  is not twice subject to payment for damages for the same act.  There is no error.  \r\n\r\nIV.  Rule \r\n  against Perpetuities\r\nRPC, LPC, and Louise P. Parsons argue the referee erred \r\n  by ruling the right of first refusal in the 1971 Covenants [5]  was void and unenforceable as \r\n  violative of the rule against perpetuities (RAP). \r\n  [6]   They assert there is no justiciable controversy surrounding the right \r\n  of first refusal provision because Peoples has not received a bona fide offer \r\n  to purchase its property.  We agree. \r\nâ€œA threshold inquiry for any court is a determination \r\n  of justiciability, i.e., whether the litigation presents an active case or controversy.â€  \r\n  Lennon v. S.C. Coastal Council, 330 S.C. 414, 415, 498 S.E.2d 906, 906 \r\n  (Ct.App.1998).  â€œA justiciable controversy is a real and substantial controversy \r\n  which is ripe and appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from \r\n  a contingent, hypothetical or abstract dispute.â€  Pee Dee Elec. Coop. Inc., \r\n  v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762 \r\n  (1983).       A declaratory judgment action must involve an actual, justiciable \r\n  controversy.  Southern Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Harrison Sales Co., 285 \r\n  S.C. 50, 328 S.E.2d 66 (1985).  \r\nIn Webb v. Reames, 326 S.C. 444, 485 S.E.2d \r\n  384 (Ct. App. 1997), the Court of Appeals held a case or controversy regarding \r\n  the validity of a pre-emptive right does not accrue until the right has been \r\n  asserted.  We concur with this ruling.  Absent a pending sale or offer for sale, \r\n  or purchase or offer to purchase, or the presence of a third party challenging \r\n  right of first refusal, there is no justiciable controversy.  See Parker \r\n  v. Weed, 713 P.2d 535 (Mont. 1986).     \r\nBecause Peoples does not have a pending offer for the \r\n  purchase of its property, there is currently no justiciable controversy concerning \r\n  the validity of the preemptive right provision in the Covenants.  Accordingly, \r\n  the referee erred by ruling on the enforceability of the right of first refusal \r\n  provision.  But see Webb v. Reames, supra (where \r\n  preemptive right might not vest within a life in being at the time of creation \r\n  of right or until later than 21 years thereafter, interest violates RAP and \r\n  is, therefore, void); see also Estate of Johnson v. Carr, \r\n  691 S.W.2d 161 (Ark. 1985) (where preemptive right is of unlimited duration, \r\n  the provision is considered void as violative of RAP); Atchison v. City of \r\n  Englewood, 463 P.2d 297 (Colo. 1969) (same); Peele v. Wilson County Bd. \r\n  of Ed., 289 S.E.2d 890 (N.C. App. 1982) (same).  \r\nV.  Acquisition \r\n  of Developersâ€™ Rights\r\nPeoples asserts the referee \r\n  erred by ruling it did not acquire RPCâ€™s and LPCâ€™s developersâ€™ rights through \r\n  succession.  Peoples relies principally upon Bd. of Managers of Medinah on \r\n  the Lake Homeowners Assâ€™n v. Bank of Ravenswood, 692 N.E.2d 402 (Ill. App. \r\n  1998), as support for its assertion that, by acquiring the undeveloped property \r\n  through foreclosure, it became the developer as a successor to RPC or LPC.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\nâ€œâ€˜[S]uccessorâ€™ is a term of art.â€™  \r\n  It may mean . . . succeeding to a place, or a right, or an interest or a power, \r\n  official, or otherwise. . . The word â€˜successorâ€™ has a twofold meaning:  It \r\n  may be used in the sense of one entitled to succeed as well as in the sense \r\n  of one who has in fact succeeded.â€  Battery Homeowners Assâ€™n v. Lincoln Financial \r\n  Resources, Inc., 309 S.C. 247, 250, 422 S.E.2d 93, 95 (1992) (internal citations \r\n  omitted) (holding where declaratory covenants permitted named homeowners association \r\n  â€œand it successorsâ€ to charge regime fee, newly-established property ownersâ€™ \r\n  association was properly considered successor entitled to charge regime fee).  \r\n\r\n In Bank of Ravenswood, id., \r\n  A.P. Ross Enterprises (A.P. Ross), as beneficiary of a trust, proposed to develop \r\n  a residential community with a certain number of units on each of three lots.  \r\n  A fourth lot was set aside for the communityâ€™s common area.  Heritage Bank held \r\n  title to the lots as trustee and recorded restrictive covenants.  The declaration \r\n  defined â€œdeveloperâ€ as  A.P. Ross â€œand its successors and assignsâ€ and the â€œdeclarantâ€ \r\n  as Heritage Bank as trustee â€œand its successors and assigns.â€ \r\nTo fund the development, Heritage Bank as trustee executed \r\n  and delivered a note to Exchange Bank.  A.P. Ross guaranteed the note and signed \r\n  a collateral agreement assigning 100% beneficial interest in the Heritage Bank \r\n  trust to Exchange Bank upon default.  After developing one lot, Heritage Bank \r\n  and A.P. Ross became insolvent and the property was purchased by Exchange Bank \r\n  through a foreclosure proceeding.  Ultimately, another purchaser, Ravenswood \r\n  Bank, acquired the three undeveloped lots and held title as trustee.  \r\nThe homeowners association filed suit against Ravenswood \r\n  Bank to recover a portion of the operating expenses for maintenance of the common \r\n  areas.  Ravenswood Bank filed a third party complaint against the established \r\n  condominium.  The trial judge ruled Ravenswood Bank was not the declarant or \r\n  the developer and, therefore, had no right to develop or erect any structure \r\n  on the property.  \r\nThe Illinois Appellate Court held \r\n  a purchaser of real property through a foreclosure sale can develop property \r\n  as a successor of a declarant. While noting developersâ€™ rights are generally \r\n  personal in nature, the Illinois Appellate Court held the powers reserved by \r\n  a developer â€œand its successors and assignsâ€ in restrictive covenants can, in \r\n  appropriate circumstances, be exercised by the developerâ€™s successors.  In making \r\n  its decision, the court expressed concern that commercial lenders may limit \r\n  the extension of credit or increase its costs if precluded from acquiring developersâ€™ \r\n  rights upon default.  \r\nWe find Bank of Ravenswood \r\n  persuasive and conclude several factors presented by this case convince us that \r\n  Peoples should be deemed a successor/co-developer of RPC/LPC.  First, we recognize \r\n  that in both the Covenants and 1988 Amendments, RPC and LPC specifically contemplated \r\n  the possibility of successorship.  See Covenants definition of LPC includes \r\n  â€œits successors;â€ 1988 Amendments define â€œdeveloperâ€ as LPC, RPC â€œand their \r\n  respective successors.â€  Second, we note Peoples could not have reasonably anticipated \r\n  the imposition of an extraordinarily large assessment, much less an initiation \r\n  fee, four months after its purchase of the Plantation property through the foreclosure \r\n  sale.  Third, as demonstrated by RPC, LPC, and LPAâ€™s actions towards Peoples, \r\n  we perceive a deep-seated animosity between the parties which may affect Peoplesâ€™ \r\n  ability to develop or otherwise dispose of its Plantation property.  Fourth, \r\n  like the Bank of Ravenswood court, we are concerned that commercial lenders \r\n  may hesitate to provide loans at beneficial rates if they are precluded from \r\n  acquiring developersâ€™ rights when the defaulting party acts less than honestly.  \r\n  Accordingly, under the unusual circumstances presented, we find Peoples acquired \r\n  the position of co-developer through its purchase of the thirty acres at the \r\n  foreclosure proceeding. [7]   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, the refereeâ€™s order is affirmed in part \r\n  and reversed in part and this matter is hereby remanded to the referee to modify \r\n  the damages award to reflect the rulings in this opinion.  Finally, we note \r\n  that as co-developers, RPC/LPC and Peoples are required to abide by the 1971 \r\n  Covenants, as amended.  As co-developers, the parties must â€œdevelop and improve \r\n  in accordance with an harmonious plan for the design and relative location [of \r\n  single-family dwellings and/or condominium apartments], so as to create a community \r\n  to be known as â€˜Litchfield Plantationâ€™ providing the greatest possible degree \r\n  of beauty and amenity for all the property owners and inhabitants thereof.â€  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] \r\n    Kidston delivered the letter to Peoples at a conference during which the parties \r\n    discussed settling the appeal of the foreclosure action and a lender liability \r\n    suit instituted by RPC, LPC, Donald Parsons, and Kidston against Peoples after \r\n    the foreclosure.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Peoples was the only property owner subject to this initiation fee.      \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] \r\n    At some point, LPA owed LPC nearly $2,000,000 for funding budget deficits.  \r\n    In turn, LPC owed RPC $100 million in mortgage debt.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    The plaintiff has the burden of proving punitive damages by clear and convincing \r\n    evidence.

Victor Rawl, Post-Conviction Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25813\r\nSubmitted December 4, 2003 - Filed April \r\n  26, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, \r\n  of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald \r\n  J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Henry Matthews \r\n  (petitioner) asserts that the post-conviction relief (PCR) judge erred in dismissing \r\n  his application for PCR.  We hold that the PCR judge erred in finding petitionerâ€™s \r\n  trial counsel rendered effective assistance. \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nPetitioner pled guilty \r\n  to armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, carjacking, and accessory after the \r\n  fact to murder.  He agreed to a thirty-year sentence for armed robbery, concurrent \r\n  twenty-year sentences for attempted armed robbery, a concurrent twenty-year \r\n  sentence for carjacking, and a concurrent fifteen-year sentence for accessory \r\n  after the fact to murder.  Petitioner did not appeal the decision.\r\nPetitioner filed a PCR application, and \r\n  the PCR judge denied relief but ordered the Department of Corrections to treat \r\n  petitioner as though he had pled guilty but mentally ill (GBMI) pursuant to \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-70 (Supp. 2002).  Petitioner submits the following question \r\n  for review:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err in finding petitionerâ€™s trial \r\n  counsel effective even though counsel failed to request a competency hearing \r\n  to determine whether petitioner was competent to stand trial?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner asserts his trial counsel was \r\n  ineffective in failing to raise the issue of his fitness to stand trial. He \r\n  contends that the PCR judge erred in denying PCR relief and, at the same time, \r\n  ruling that petitioner should be treated as having pled GBMI.  We find that \r\n  petitionerâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to make a motion for a \r\n  Blair [1]  hearing given the evidence of petitionerâ€™s\r\nincompetency.&nbsp; \r\nDue process prohibits the conviction of an incompetent \r\n  defendant, and this right may not be waived by a guilty plea.  Jeter v. State, \r\n  308 S.C. 230, 232, 417 S.E.2d 594, 595-596 (1992) (citations omitted).  \r\nIn a PCR action, the petitioner must prove by a \r\n  preponderance of the evidence that he was incompetent when he entered his guilty \r\n  plea.  Id. at 232, 417 S.E.2d at 596; Rule 71.1(e), SCRCP. \r\nIn order to find that petitionerâ€™s trial counsel \r\n  was ineffective for refusing to request a Blair hearing on petitionerâ€™s \r\n  competency to stand trial, petitioner must show that counsel was deficient and \r\n  that the deficiency prejudiced the outcome of petitionerâ€™s proceedings.  Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 55, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674  (1984); Gallman \r\n  v. State, 307 S.C. 273, 414 S.E.2d 780 (1992).  \r\nIn Jeter, this Court proclaimed that in \r\n  proving Strickland prejudice within the context of counselâ€™s failure \r\n  to fully investigate the petitionerâ€™s mental capacity, â€œthe [petitioner] need \r\n  only show a â€˜reasonable probabilityâ€™ that he was either insane at the time [the \r\n  crime was committed] or incompetent at the time of the plea.â€  Jeter, \r\n  308 S.C. at 233, 417 S.E.2d at 596.  \r\nDuring the PCR hearing, petitionerâ€™s mother testified \r\n  that petitioner had learning disabilities, took special education classes, and \r\n  was â€œslower than other children.â€ \r\n  [2]   In addition, petitionerâ€™s mother testified that petitioner was in \r\n  a near-fatal auto accident one year before the crimes were committed. [3]   As a result of the accident, petitioner had surgery on his \r\n  neck and his head, as well as a tracheotomy to keep him breathing.    \r\nDr. John Cusack (Cusack), a psychiatrist, testified \r\n  about his five evaluations of petitioner prior to the PCR hearing.  He testified \r\n  that petitionerâ€™s pre-accident condition was â€œat best below the realm of average \r\n  and possibly mild retardation.â€  Petitionerâ€™s auto accident caused him to suffer \r\n  from anoxia, which causes cerebral damage resulting from the lack of oxygen.  \r\n  Cusack described petitionerâ€™s post-accident mental condition as â€œsomeone with \r\n  severe frontal lobe brain damage, which are the cognitive areasâ€ and concluded \r\n  that petitioner was incompetent and could not participate in his own defense.  \r\n\r\nIn describing petitionerâ€™s mental condition, Cusack \r\n  referred to petitionerâ€™s quick, nonsensical responses to questions.  When Cusack \r\n  asked petitioner where he was, he gave the quick, basic response of â€œhere.â€  \r\n  When asked if he was in a prison, cafeteria, or zoo, petitioner responded, â€œzoo.â€  \r\n  When asked what his name was, petitioner responded, â€œme.â€  \r\nThrough the testimony of Cusack mentioned above, \r\n  petitioner clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence that he was \r\n  incompetent at the time he entered his guilty plea.  Consequently, petitionerâ€™s \r\n  trial counsel was deficient for failing to request a Blair hearing so \r\n  that the court could examine petitionerâ€™s fitness to stand trial.  \r\nWe find that trial counselâ€™s failure to request \r\n  a Blair hearing prejudiced petitioner under the Jeter standard \r\n  because there was, at minimum, a â€œreasonable probabilityâ€ that petitioner was \r\n  incompetent at the time of his guilty plea.     \r\nTherefore, the PCR judge erred in finding that \r\n  petitionerâ€™s trial counsel rendered effective assistance.  \r\nConclusion\r\nSince petitionerâ€™s trial counsel rendered \r\n  ineffective assistance in failing to explore petitionerâ€™s incompetence, petitionerâ€™s \r\n  guilty plea is vacated, and petitioner is granted a new trial.  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  State v.

Creighton Waters, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Robert Lee \r\n  Nance (Petitioner), sentenced to death for murder, appeals from the post-conviction \r\n  relief (PCR) courtâ€™s denial of his application for PCR.  We hold that the manner \r\n  in which Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel investigated, planned, and conducted his \r\n  defense constitutes a classic example of a complete breakdown in the adversarial \r\n  process.  Therefore, we grant Petitioner a new trial.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nThe victims, Robert and Violet \r\n  Fraley, were attacked at home where they lived alone. \r\n  [1]   On the night of the intrusion, Mr. Fraley testified that he and his \r\n  wife went to bed around 9:30 or 10:00 p.m.  Mr. Fraley awoke to the sound of \r\n  someone knocking on the front door of the house.  Mr. Fraley testified that \r\n  he saw a man standing on the porch, and that the man asked him if he could come \r\n  in to use the phone because his truck had broken down.  Mr. Fraley told him \r\n  he could use the phone outside in his shop.  When the man said he did not have \r\n  a light to see his way to the shed, Mr. Fraley left the door to get him a flashlight.  \r\n  Mr. Fraley testified that when he unlatched the door to hand over the light, \r\n  the man forced the door open and immediately began stabbing him with a screwdriver.\r\nAt some point, Mrs. Fraley entered \r\n  the room and tried to help Mr. Fraley as he tried unsuccessfully to get away \r\n  from the intruder.  Mr. Fraley was bleeding profusely and his wife was trying \r\n  to wipe up blood while the intruder was demanding money and the keys to their \r\n  car.  Mrs. Fraley retrieved both of their wallets and their keys and gave approximately \r\n  $194 in cash and the keys to the intruder.  Mr. Fraley testified that he pleaded \r\n  with the intruder not to kill him and his wife, but that the intruder replied \r\n  that he was going to kill both of them.  The intruder then raped and killed \r\n  Mrs. Fraley.  Miraculously, Mr. Fraley survived the attack but was hospitalized \r\n  for thirteen days.  \r\nPetitioner was arrested in the \r\n  early morning hours following the attack after he was pulled over driving the \r\n  Fraleysâ€™ Cadillac.  There was blood on his clothes that was later determined \r\n  to be Mrs. Fraleyâ€™s.  The car also contained a bank envelope that was taken \r\n  from the Fraleysâ€™ home during the attack.  Two people were in the car with Petitioner \r\n  when he was stopped.  One person fled the scene and was never apprehended.  \r\n  The other person, Erskine Green, testified at Petitionerâ€™s trial that he did \r\n  not know Petitioner and that Petitioner had picked him and the other man up \r\n  on the side of the road.  \r\nPetitioner was convicted of murder, \r\n  criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the first degree, first-degree burglary, assault \r\n  and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), and armed robbery.  He was sentenced \r\n  to death on the murder charge.  He was also sentenced to life for burglary, \r\n  thirty years for CSC, twenty years for ABIK, and twenty-five years for armed \r\n  robbery.  His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal.  State \r\n  v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996).  Subsequently, Petitioner \r\n  filed a PCR application.  The PCR court denied relief, and Petitioner asks this \r\n  Court for relief on both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial.  \r\nPetitioner has submitted many \r\n  issues for review, challenging many of his counselâ€™s actions and lack of actions \r\n  during trial, but, in our view, the essential issue in this case is as follows:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err in finding \r\n  that Petitionerâ€™s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to counsel were not \r\n  violated because defense counsel failed to sufficiently investigate, prepare \r\n  and present the case?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner claims that the PCR judge erred in finding \r\n  that his defense counsel were not ineffective for failing to prepare and present \r\n  the case as required under the Sixth Amendment.  We agree. \r\n â€œThe very premise of our adversary system of criminal \r\n  justice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote \r\n  the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.â€  \r\n  Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862, 95 S. Ct. 2550, 2555, 45 L. Ed. \r\n  2d 593 (1975).  \r\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees that every criminal \r\n  defendant shall receive â€œAssistance of Counselâ€ in establishing his defense.  \r\n  U.S. Const. amend. VI.  On May 14, 1984, the United States Supreme Court handed \r\n  down two opinions holding that the Sixth Amendment requires that the criminal \r\n  defendant receive effective assistance of counsel.  United States \r\n  v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 80 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1984); Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).  \r\n\r\nIn Cronic, the Court characterized the protection \r\n  that the Sixth Amendment affords the defendant:\r\n\r\nThe right to the effective assistance of counsel is thus \r\n  the right of the accused to require the prosecutionâ€™s case to survive the crucible \r\n  of meaningful adversarial testing. When a true adversarial criminal trial has \r\n  been conducted -- even if defense counsel may have made demonstrable errors \r\n  -- the kind of testing envisioned by the Sixth Amendment has occurred. But if \r\n  the process loses its character as a confrontation between adversaries, the \r\n  constitutional guarantee is violated. As Judge Wyzanski has written: â€œWhile \r\n  a criminal trial is not a game in which the participants are expected to enter \r\n  the ring with a near match in skills, neither is it a sacrifice of unarmed prisoners \r\n  to gladiators.â€\r\n\r\n466 U.S. at 656-657, 104 S. Ct. \r\n  at 2045-2046 (citations omitted).  \r\nIn Strickland, the Court set forth a two-part \r\n  test for evaluating the effectiveness of the criminal defendantâ€™s attorney.  \r\n  To receive a new trial on the grounds of ineffectiveness of counsel, the petitioner \r\n  must prove (1) that his counselâ€™s representation was deficient, and (2) that \r\n  there is a reasonable probability that counselâ€™s deficient conduct prejudiced \r\n  the outcome of petitionerâ€™s trial.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 \r\n  S. Ct. at 2068.   \r\nThe Court stated in Cronic that \r\n  there are three circumstances in which the defendantâ€™s representation is so \r\n  inadequate that the second element of the Strickland test, the prejudice \r\n  element, can be presumed.  Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658-659, 104 S. Ct. at \r\n  2039.           \r\nThe first scenario in which prejudice \r\n  is presumed is when there is a â€œcomplete denial of counsel,â€ which occurs when \r\n  a trial is rendered unfair because the defendant is denied assistance of counsel \r\n  during a â€œcritical stageâ€ of his trial.  Id.  \r\nIn the second scenario, prejudice is presumed if \r\n  â€œcounsel entirely fails to subject the prosecutionâ€™s case to a meaningful adversarial \r\n  testing.â€ When there has been no meaningful adversarial testing, then â€œthe adversary \r\n  process itself [is] presumptively unreliable.â€  Id.  In Bell v. Cone, \r\n  the U.S. Supreme Court explained further that â€œthe attorneyâ€™s failure [to test \r\n  the prosecutorâ€™s case] must be completeâ€ for this standard to be met.  535 U.S. \r\n  685, 697, 122 S. Ct. 1843, 1851, 152 L. Ed. 2d 914 (2002).      \r\nThird, prejudice is presumed when circumstances \r\n  dictate that no attorney could render effective assistance of counsel.  Cronic, \r\n  466 U.S. at 659-662, 104 S. Ct. at 2047-2048. [2]   \r\nWe now apply the Cronic analysis to the \r\n  case at hand.\r\nTrial Presentation\r\nFollowing Petitionerâ€™s arrest, \r\n  defense counsel was appointed as Petitionerâ€™s lead counsel.  At the time he \r\n  was appointed, defense counsel had either recently suffered from or was then \r\n  suffering from pneumonia, gout, ulcers, diabetes, alcoholism, and congestive \r\n  heart failure.  During the trial he was taking various prescription medications, \r\n  including Valium, Lopressor, Isocet, and Tenormin.  At the PCR hearing, Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  experts testified that the side effects of those medications included impaired \r\n  memory, lack of sleep, and sedation.  Defense counselâ€™s testimony at the PCR \r\n  hearing indicated that he remembered very little from the trial that took place \r\n  5 years before the PCR hearing.    \r\nAn attorney, who had only \r\n  been practicing law for eighteen months, was appointed as co-counsel.  Co-counsel \r\n  testified at the PCR hearing that Petitionerâ€™s mother was the only family member \r\n  who was interviewed prior to trial; that he did not recall that anyone investigated \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s background; and that no one had requested Petitionerâ€™s records \r\n  from the Department of Corrections. \r\nThe psychologist who planned to offer expert testimony \r\n  concerning Petitionerâ€™s mental health, Dr. Dewitt (Dewitt), asked defense counsel \r\n  for Petitionerâ€™s medical records, social history, statements from family members, \r\n  and statements from the Department of Corrections staff but never received them.  \r\n  He received Petitionerâ€™s hospital records a few hours before trial.\r\nGuilt Phase\r\nWhen introducing himself in his opening statement \r\n  to the jury, co-counsel said, â€œI did not ask [to represent the Petitioner], \r\n  I was simply appointed.  [defense counsel], as the public defender, did not \r\n  ask for this case either.  He was just appointed to represent Mr. Nance.â€  In \r\n  addition, defense counsel presented only three witnesses to testify on behalf \r\n  of Petitionerâ€™s defense: a corrections officer, an unqualified expert, and Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  sister.\r\n Defense counselâ€™s first witness, a Florence County \r\n  detention center officer, testified that while in prison, Petitioner threw urine \r\n  at a female corrections officer. [3]    On cross-examination, the officer \r\n  testified that this episode was Petitionerâ€™s only incident of misbehavior during \r\n  the seven-month period that Petitioner was under his watch.\r\nThe defenseâ€™s second witness, Dewitt, testified \r\n  about Petitionerâ€™s mental health. Based on only two meetings with the Petitioner, \r\n  Dewitt opined that Petitioner more closely resembled a criminal who was guilty \r\n  but mentally ill.  Defense counsel was not successful in qualifying Dewitt as \r\n  an expert.\r\nThe defense rested after Dewittâ€™s testimony.  \r\n  The trial judge then granted defense counselâ€™s request to reopen his presentation \r\n  so that Petitionerâ€™s sister could testify.  Defense counsel failed to prepare \r\n  the sisterâ€™s testimony but asked that she testify about Petitionerâ€™s childhood.  \r\n  The sister testified that Petitioner was an abnormal child: pretending to be \r\n  an undertaker, he buried one of his brothers; pulled a gun on their father; \r\n  stabbed himself with a broken bottle; and killed their pets.     \r\nIn sum, the testimony that defense counsel \r\n  presented in Petitionerâ€™s guilt phase defense consisted of testimony of a corrections \r\n  officer concerning the only incident of misconduct that Petitioner committed \r\n  while incarcerated; an opinion by an uninformed psychiatrist who was not qualified \r\n  as an expert; and unprepared testimony of Petitionerâ€™s sister about Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  oddities as a child. \r\nSentencing \r\n  Phase\r\nDefense counselâ€™s mitigation presentation \r\n  during the sentencing phase of the trial lasted seven minutes.  Counsel began \r\n  by waiving the opening statement and then incorporated the meager amount of \r\n  defense testimony elicited during the guilt phase.  \r\nDefense counsel then presented \r\n  the testimony of a corrections officer of the Florence Detention Center, who \r\n  testified that Petitioner was taking two prescription medications, Cogentin \r\n  and Haldol, and that Petitioner had taken Haldol that morning. \r\n  [4]   Counsel presented no further testimony, to which the trial judge responded \r\n  by asking, â€œAre you ready to go to the jury?â€  Counsel responded, â€œWe incorporate \r\n  what we feel, Your Honor -- the doctor and the other testimony by the sister \r\n  would be repetitious.â€  The judge then replied, â€œDo you need any time to collect \r\n  your thoughts?  This is rather quick.â€ \r\n  [5]   Co-counsel gave the closing argument, refusing to plead for Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  life and referring to Petitioner as a â€œsickâ€ man who did â€œsick things.â€\r\nWe find that this trial presentation, in its entirety, \r\n  represents a classic Cronic ineffectiveness case, falling under the second \r\n  Cronic scenario because there was a total breakdown in the adversarial \r\n  process during both the guilt phase and penalty phase of Petitionerâ€™s trial.  \r\n  For the reasons set forth below, we presume Petitioner was prejudiced, and accordingly, \r\n  grant him a new trial.\r\nFirst, Petitioner was disadvantaged from the outset \r\n  because lead defense counsel was in ill health and on heavy medication, and \r\n  co-counsel had only practiced law for eighteen months.    \r\nSecond, in aid of its claim that Petitioner was \r\n  mentally ill, the defense had wanted Petitioner to appear in the courtroom in \r\n  his natural demeanor, unaffected by the administration of psychotropic drugs.  \r\n  The defense was successful in getting the trial judge to order such.  Nevertheless, \r\n  defense counsel failed to inform the jail personnel of the trial judgeâ€™s order \r\n  that Petitioner be taken off the anti-psychotic drug, Haldol. Consequently, \r\n  Petitioner remained in a drug-influenced demeanor during the entire trial, and \r\n  the jury never observed his natural demeanor.  \r\nThird, the trial had just begun when co-counsel \r\n  communicated to the jury that neither he nor defense counsel wanted to be there.  \r\n\r\nFourth, while defense counsel may have been pursuing \r\n  a defense of guilty but mentally ill (GBMI), \r\n  [6]  he failed to qualify his own expert.  Further, by eliciting the unprepared \r\n  testimony of Petitionerâ€™s sister only after defense psychologist Dewitt \r\n  testified, defense counsel failed to give his unqualified expert, at minimum, \r\n  the opportunity to inform the jury of how the sisterâ€™s testimony of Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  mental irregularities as a child could lead to a conclusion that Petitioner \r\n  was mentally ill at the time of the murder.    \r\nFifth, defense counsel presented no adaptability \r\n  evidence at the sentencing hearing.  In fact, by merely incorporating the testimony \r\n  elicited from the guilt phase, defense counsel gave the impression that Petitioner \r\n  had not adapted to confinement, because the only evidence that had been presented \r\n  concerning his confinement was the urine-throwing incident.\r\nDuring the PCR hearing, Petitioner \r\n  presented testimony to show that the urine-throwing incident was the only instance \r\n  of bad behavior during confinement.  In fact, Petitioner was selected as the \r\n  Manning Correctional Institutionâ€™s inmate of the year and was nominated for \r\n  the Department of Correctionsâ€™ inmate of the year.  He also sang in the prison \r\n  choir and participated in other Christian activities.  A jail administrator \r\n  and prison minister testified that Petitioner was a model inmate.  Defense counsel \r\n  could have easily discovered this adaptability evidence prior to trial but failed \r\n  to do so. [7] \r\nSixth, defense counsel presented \r\n  no mitigating social history evidence to explain the Petitionerâ€™s odd childhood \r\n  behavior to which his sister referred to during the guilt phase.  Defense counsel \r\n  failed to reveal that Petitioner was beaten throughout his childhood; his father \r\n  was an alcoholic who fought with many family members; he was treated with alcohol \r\n  as a child in lieu of over-the-counter medication; and he grew up in a family \r\n  of extreme poverty and physical deprivation.  \r\nSeventh, defense counselâ€™s seven-minute mitigation \r\n  presentation failed to provide the jury with any insight concerning Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  mental illness.  At the PCR hearing, Petitioner introduced evidence that he \r\n  has a family history of schizophrenia, he has a history of hearing voices in \r\n  his head, and he has suffered neurological damage.    \r\nFinally, during the closing argument, co-counsel \r\n  failed to plead for Petitionerâ€™s life and referred to him as a â€œsickâ€ man. \r\nWe hold that this trial \r\n  presentation amounts to a classic Cronic ineffectiveness case, as defense \r\n  counsel completely failed to test the prosecutionâ€™s case.  If anything, defense \r\n  counselâ€™s actions, and inactions, reinforced the prosecutionâ€™s argument that \r\n  the Petitioner should be convicted and sentenced to death.  \r\nWe decline to recognize \r\n  this consistently inept form of lawyer conduct as acceptable in this state, \r\n  nor will we employ a prejudice analysis, for â€œ[defense] counselâ€™s ineffectiveness \r\n  [was] so pervasive as to render a particularized prejudice inquiry unnecessary.â€  \r\n  Frett v. State, 298 S.C. 54, 56, 378 S.E.2d 249, 251 (1988).  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that defense counselâ€™s conduct, \r\n  investigation, preparation and presentation of Petitionerâ€™s defense during the \r\n  guilt phase and sentencing phase of Petitionerâ€™s trial provided no meaningful \r\n  adversarial challenge to the prosecutionâ€™s case.  \r\nWe apply the Cronic â€œmeaningful adversarial \r\n  challengeâ€ analysis to this case because we find that this trial represents \r\n  the classic example of a judicial process that lost â€œits character as a confrontation \r\n  between adversaries.â€  Cronic, 466 U.S. at 656-657, 104 S. Ct. \r\n  at 2045-2046.  Thus, Petitionerâ€™s constitutional right to effective assistance \r\n  of counsel has been violated.\r\nAccordingly, we REVERSE Petitionerâ€™s convictions \r\n  and sentences and REMAND the case for a new trial. \r\nMOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  James R. Barber, III, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Mr. and Mrs. Fraley were 78 and 73 years old respectively at the \r\n    time of the attack.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The Fourth Circuit has held that the presumption of prejudice as \r\n    defined by Cronic only applies in extraordinary circumstances.  Young \r\n    v. Catoe, 205 F.3d 750 (4th Cir. 2000).  Otherwise, when prejudice is \r\n    not presumed, the Strickland standard applies.  Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  At the PCR hearing, Petitionerâ€™s PCR counsel presented testimony \r\n    that the reason why Petitioner threw urine at the female office was because \r\n    she reminded him of his aunt.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The trial judge forbade Petitioner from taking \r\n    any antipsychotic drugs during trial.  Haldol is a very strong antipsychotic \r\n    drug used in the treatment of acute schizophrenia and acute psychosis, controlling \r\n    a patientâ€™s tendency towards aggression and agitation. http://www.psyweb.com/Drughtm/halope.html \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  This is an example of the trial judgeâ€™s commendable attempt to insure \r\n    that defense counsel was effectively representing his client.  Unfortunately, \r\n    the trial judgeâ€™s ability to hold defense counsel to his constitutional obligation \r\n    to effectively represent his client was greatly limited by (1) the desultory \r\n    manner in which defense counsel tried this case and (2) the fact that at the \r\n    time this case was tried, South Carolina common law provided little guidance \r\n    as to what constituted an attorneyâ€™s complete failure to provide effective \r\n    representation.  We hope that this opinion provides some clarity as to what \r\n    does not constitute effective representation.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Dewitt testified that Petitionerâ€™s mental incapacity did not rise \r\n    to the level of the Mâ€™Naughten standard for insanity but did opine \r\n    that he met the standard for GBMI.  Despite evidence of Petitionerâ€™s mental \r\n    incapacity, defense counsel failed to raise the issue of whether Petitioner \r\n    was competent to stand trial.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  The United States Supreme Court has recently recognized that defense \r\n    counsel must conduct a reasonable investigation â€œto discover all reasonably \r\n    available mitigation evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence \r\n    that may be introduced by the prosecutor.â€  Wiggins v.
