Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25886\r\n  Heard February 19, 2004 - Filed November 1, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        Senior Assistant Appellate Defender Wanda Haile, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General \r\n          John W. McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n          all of Columbia; and Thomas E. Pope, of York, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant was convicted [1]  of murder, first degree burglary, first degree criminal sexual \r\n  conduct (CSC), and robbery.Â  He received a death sentence for the murder, the \r\n  jury having found three statutory aggravating circumstances, [2]  and received three concurrent sentences for the other offenses. \r\n  [3]  Appellant alleges errors occurred in both the guilt phase and the sentencing \r\n  phase of his trial.Â  We affirm appellantâ€™s convictions and sentences.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 6:15 a.m. on December 31, 1989, the eighty-six-year-old victim \r\n  opened her door in response to someoneâ€™s knocking.Â  A black male forced his \r\n  way into her apartment, beat her about the chest and head, and demanded money.Â  \r\n  The man forced the victim into her bedroom where he ripped off her nightgown \r\n  and anally raped her.Â  He took $40 from her purse and left the apartment after \r\n  ripping the living room phone from the wall.\r\nAt 7:45 a.m., the victimâ€™s friend (Mrs. Thrasher) phoned to check on the victim.Â  \r\n  After six or seven rings, the victim answered and told Mrs. Thrasher she had \r\n  been beaten, anally raped, and robbed.Â  Mrs. Thrasher called another friend, \r\n  Mrs. Byers, who had an automobile and a key to the victimâ€™s apartment.Â  Mrs. \r\n  Byers went to the apartment, noticed it was messy, spoke with the victim who \r\n  told her the assailant was â€œbig and dark,â€ and then drove to the police department \r\n  since the living room phone had been pulled off the wall. \r\n  [4] \r\nThe first officer on the scene was Dale Edwards.Â  The victim told him that \r\n  around 6 or 6:30 a.m. she heard knocking at her front door and that when she \r\n  opened the door, a black male forced his way in.Â  She had taken a shower before \r\n  the police arrived.Â  Officer Edwards removed the sheets and pillowcase from \r\n  the bed for use as evidence, and placed the items in a paper grocery bag taken \r\n  from the victimâ€™s kitchen.Â  Lt. Barnett arrived and assisted in the evidence \r\n  collection.Â  A pink nightgown, a housecoat, and a rag were removed from the \r\n  bathroom and placed in another grocery bag.Â  The victim gave Officer Edwards \r\n  a pink paper towel with blood on it that he placed in a manila envelope brought \r\n  to the scene by Captain Mobley, the third officer on the scene.\r\nWhile the three police officers were there, two paramedics arrived to transport \r\n  the victim to a local hospital emergency room.Â  Blood samples were taken, but \r\n  a rape kit was not processed because the victim was complaining of hip pain \r\n  and medical personnel were awaiting X-rays before performing the exam.Â  The \r\n  blood testing kit used to take samples from the victim had â€œexpiredâ€ several \r\n  months earlier. [5] Â  Before the \r\n  victimâ€™s mental state began to deteriorate, she described her attacker to an \r\n  emergency room nurse as a black male in his late twenties.Â  On February 19, \r\n  1990, the victim was transferred to a nursing home where she died in March.Â  \r\n  The cause of death was pneumonia, which developed as the consequence of her \r\n  severe brain injury.Â  \r\nCaptain Mobley testified he arrived at the victimâ€™s apartment as the EMS personnel \r\n  were transporting her out the door.Â  He took custody of the evidentiary items \r\n  from Officer Edwards and Lt. Barnett.Â  He sent Officer Edwards door to door \r\n  in the neighborhood and instructed Lt. Barnett to go to the hospital and speak \r\n  with the victim.\r\nLt. Barnett recorded the victimâ€™s statement at the \r\n  hospital emergency room before she became confused.Â  She described her attackerâ€™s \r\n  clothing: â€œa dark jacket, must have been blue or black, must have been black;â€ \r\n  â€œa pair of those funny looking pants . . . not the old pant, but something thatâ€™s \r\n  kind of mixed up you know;â€ his hair: â€œkind of long.Â  Not too long, but a little \r\n  longer than you usually wear it;â€ she then said: â€œhe was middle aged.Â  He was \r\n  young.Â  He was not too young.Â  And he, as I remember, his hair was not short \r\n  or not too long.â€Â  The victim described her attacker as dark skinned, â€œnot too \r\n  heavy.Â  Not too slim.â€Â  \r\nLater that day, Officer Edwards talked to several of the victimâ€™s neighbors.Â  \r\n  Ms. Boyd told him she heard knocking at her door about 3 a.m.; Mr. Lynn, who \r\n  lived next door to the victim, reported knocking between 5:30 a.m. and 6:30 \r\n  a.m.; and Ms. Diggs, who lived on the other side of the victim, heard someone \r\n  knocking on her door around 6 or 6:30 a.m.\r\nOfficer Grady Harper testified he was dispatched to an apartment complex near \r\n  the victimâ€™s residence at about 4:43 a.m. on December 31, 1989.Â  A number of \r\n  people, including appellant, were making a disturbance, and Officer Harper told \r\n  them to quiet down and move on.Â Â Â  Appellant was unruly, and Officer Harper \r\n  called for back-up to assist in arresting appellant.Â  When the additional officers \r\n  arrived, appellant ran.Â  Officer Harper saw appellant get into a car; Officer \r\n  Harper gave chase in his patrol car.Â  The driver stopped the car and appellant \r\n  ran from it.Â  The last time Officer Harper saw appellant was about 5:30 a.m. \r\n  and the other officers were chasing appellant.Â  One of the â€œchasingâ€ officers \r\n  testified he lost sight of appellant at about 5:20 a.m.Â  Appellant was wearing \r\n  a black sweater with a hood and blue jeans. \r\nCaptain Mobley testified that after Officer Edwards and Lt. Barnett left the \r\n  victimâ€™s apartment; he locked the front door and began processing the scene.Â  \r\n  He seized one more paper towel, the telephone touched by the assailant, and \r\n  the victimâ€™s purse.Â  He then dusted the apartment for fingerprints.Â  On the \r\n  interior side of the front door he photographed and lifted a palm print located \r\n  slightly above the doorknob.Â  Captain Mobley also photographed and lifted a \r\n  print from the outside of the front door.Â  The inside palm print was later identified \r\n  as that of appellant.Â  \r\nÂ Appellant was arrested on the afternoon of December \r\n  31, 1989, at his fatherâ€™s home in York, and denied ever having been inside the \r\n  victimâ€™s apartment.Â  When the police arrived, appellant was wearing a black \r\n  hooded sweatshirt, underwear, and socks.Â  He dressed in jeans before being transported \r\n  by the police.Â  While he was dressing, Officer Boot Smith noticed a tank top \r\n  that appeared to have blood on it and asked if the police officers could take \r\n  it.Â  Appellant consented and stated the blood came from a fight he had been \r\n  involved in the night before at a bar. \r\nForensic evidence linked appellant to the crime scene.Â  In addition to the \r\n  palm print found on the victimâ€™s door, the State introduced evidence that:\r\n\r\n  (1) fibers consistent with a black sweatshirt owned by appellant were found \r\n    on the victimâ€™s bed sheets;\r\n  (2) a blue acrylic fiber was found on the victimâ€™s pink nightgown, and another \r\n    on appellantâ€™s blue jeans:Â  they â€œcould have come from the same common source \r\n    or it could have come from different sources, but indeed they do . . . match \r\n    each other;â€ \r\n  (3) microscopically consistent fibers were found on the pink nightgown and, \r\n    in the form of a â€œfiber pill,â€ on appellantâ€™s underwear;\r\n  (4) appellantâ€™s underwear contained a mixture of DNA from two individuals \r\n    and 99.99% of the population other than appellant and the victim were excluded \r\n    as contributors to that mixture; and\r\n  (5) appellantâ€™s tank top was found to contain a mixture of his blood and \r\n    the victimâ€™s blood.Â  \r\n\r\nThe defense theory was two-fold.Â  \r\n  First, it sought to discredit the forensic evidence by showing the evidence \r\n  was mishandled and by demonstrating the many opportunities for contamination \r\n  because of unprofessional errors.Â  The defense also sought to suggest that the \r\n  alleged contamination was not merely the result of simple negligence, but part \r\n  of a plot on the part of certain law enforcement officers to see that appellant \r\n  was convicted of these crimes.Â  In connection with this prong of the defense \r\n  strategy, appellant sought to introduce evidence of third party guilt.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Whether the circuit court erred by refusing to admit evidence of third party \r\n    guilt? Â \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAt a pretrial hearing, appellant proffered evidence of third party guilt.Â  \r\n  Specifically, he sought to introduce evidence at trial that the crimes were \r\n  actually committed by Jimmy McCaw White (Jimmy).\r\n1. Pre-trial testimony\r\nLike appellant, Jimmy is a black male.Â  At the time of the victimâ€™s murder, \r\n  he was twenty-two years old; appellant was eighteen.Â  Jimmyâ€™s hair was longer \r\n  than appellantâ€™s and Jimmy had lighter skin than appellant.\r\nSeveral witnesses placed Jimmy in the victimâ€™s neighborhood near 6 a.m. on \r\n  December 31, 1989.Â  Frenetta Johnson testified she saw Jimmy going toward the \r\n  apartments where the victim lived between 4:30 and 5:30 a.m.Â  Later in her testimony, \r\n  she narrowed the time to â€œfrom four-thirty to something to five.â€Â  Meshelley \r\n  Gilmore testified she observed Jimmy in an apartment parking lot as she drove \r\n  away from her home at about 3:30 or 4 a.m., and that he was still there when \r\n  she returned at 4:30-4:45 a.m.Â  These apartments were near the victimâ€™s complex.Â  \r\n  Mrs. Gilmore was awakened by a police officer knocking on her door at 7:30 a.m.Â  \r\n  She told him she had seen Jimmy hanging around the parking lot earlier that \r\n  morning. \r\nDeloris Brown testified she saw Jimmy walking down the victimâ€™s street in the \r\n  direction of the victimâ€™s apartment between 4 and 5 a.m. on December 31, 1989.Â  \r\n  Eighty-seven-year-old Anna Boyd, a resident of the same apartment complex as \r\n  the victim, testified that someone knocked on her door during the night of December \r\n  30-December 31.Â  The knocker said, â€œOpen the door, my man, this is Jimmy, open \r\n  the door.â€Â  These are appellantâ€™s â€œproximityâ€ witnesses.\r\nAppellant also presented several witnesses who testified that Jimmy had acknowledged \r\n  that appellant was â€œinnocentâ€ or to whom Jimmy had admitted his guilt.Â  Thomas \r\n  Murray testified that Jimmy said he knew appellant was innocent, and that he \r\n  (Jimmy) could not be brought to court for it.Â  Ken Rhodes testified he asked \r\n  Jimmy whether the word on the street, that Jimmy was the victimâ€™s murderer, \r\n  was true and that Jimmy â€œput his head down and he raised his head back up and \r\n  he said well, you know, I like older women. . . . and he never called the ladyâ€™s \r\n  name but you know he say that he liked old women and that yeah he did what they \r\n  say he did and you know that somebody else was locked up for it.Â  And you know \r\n  itâ€™s like he didnâ€™t have no regrets about it at all.â€Â  Rhodes went on to testify \r\n  that â€œ[Jimmy] didnâ€™t say exactly what he done, he just told me that she had \r\n  some good stuff . . . He said that he didnâ€™t kill the lady.Â  The lady was alive \r\n  when he left . . . .â€\r\nMattie Mae Scott testified that in October 1997 she was at her sonâ€™s house \r\n  when Jimmy came to visit.Â  Jimmy was â€œpartially intoxicated,â€ and when the others \r\n  began talking about the â€˜old lady in Yorkâ€™ that Jimmy had raped and murdered, \r\n  Jimmy said, â€œYes, I did it but [appellant] is going to fry for it.â€ \r\nThe defenseâ€™s â€œstar witnessâ€ was Stephen Westbrook. \r\n  [6] Â  He testified that in 1990 and again in 1994 Jimmy told him he had \r\n  broken into the victimâ€™s house and raped her.Â  Jimmy told Westbrook that Officer \r\n  Boot Smith [7]  had told Jimmy \r\n  to keep quiet about his guilt.Â  Westbrook further testified that Officer Smith \r\n  and Investigator Potts came to see Westbrook before appellantâ€™s first trial \r\n  and offered to get him out of jail if he would testify that appellant had confessed \r\n  to him.Â  Westbrook testified that in June 2000, about two months before this \r\n  pretrial hearing, he was brought to Rock Hill from Kirkland Correctional Institute.Â  \r\n  In Rock Hill, he was confronted by several employees of the solicitorâ€™s office \r\n  who sought to convince him to testify against appellant in the upcoming second \r\n  trial.Â  Westbrook stated that the solicitorâ€™s office employees acknowledged \r\n  to him that they had manufactured underwear evidence incriminating appellant.Â  \r\n  Westbrook also testified that Jimmy told him that Officer Smith was out to â€œframeâ€ \r\n  appellant, and that even appellantâ€™s former attorney had urged him to testify \r\n  against appellant.Â  Finally, Westbrook testified an employee of the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  office stated that, in addition to the manufactured underwear evidence, they \r\n  had lifted one of appellantâ€™s palm prints from the county jail door to use against \r\n  him at trial.Â  These are appellantâ€™s â€œconfessionâ€ witnesses.\r\nFurther, the defense called a witness who testified that when asked why he \r\n  would not confess, Jimmy told him â€œitâ€™s all over and done with and [appellant] \r\n  is going to do the time for it.â€ \r\nÂ The former receptionist at the \r\n  York Public Defenderâ€™s Office testified that Jimmy brought up the crime in conversation \r\n  with her one day, and remarked that he did not believe appellant was guilty, \r\n  that maybe Jimmy knew who did it, and that everybody on the street knew.\r\nFinally, the defense called Jimmy to testify at the pretrial hearing.Â  The \r\n  trial judge instructed Jimmy he had the right to remain silent and the \r\n  right to an attorney, and warned Jimmy that anything he chose to say \r\n  could be used against him.Â  Jimmy declined the offer of an attorney and opted \r\n  to testify.Â  Jimmy testified he left York and was home in Sharon by 2 a.m. on \r\n  December 31, 1989.Â  He claimed to have ridden with Junior Lytle.Â  Lytle, however, \r\n  testified at the pretrial hearing and denied driving Jimmy home to Sharon that \r\n  night.Â  Jimmy denied telling Stephen Westbrook that he had raped and killed \r\n  the victim and denied confessing in the presence of Thomas Murray or John Dixon \r\n  or telling the York Public Defenderâ€™s receptionist that he knew who killed the \r\n  victim.\r\n2. \r\n  Standard for admitting third party guilt\r\nWe have held that a defendant seeking to present evidence \r\n  of third party guilt must meet this standard:\r\n\r\n  [T]he evidence offered by accused as to the commission of the crime by another \r\n    person must be limited to such facts as are inconsistent with his own guilt, \r\n    and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his \r\n    own innocence; evidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare \r\n    suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to the commission \r\n    of the crime by another, is not admissible.\r\n\r\nState v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 104, 16 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1941) (citing \r\n  16 C.J. 560).\r\nThe Gregory court went on to cite from 20 Am. \r\n  Jur. 254:\r\n\r\n  But before such testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection \r\n    with it, such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point \r\n    out such other person as the guilty party.Â  Remote acts, disconnected and \r\n    outside the crime itself, cannot be separately proved for such a purpose.Â  \r\n    An orderly and unbiased judicial inquiry as to the guilt or innocence of a \r\n    defendant on trial does not contemplate that such defendant be permitted, \r\n    by way of defense, to indulge in conjectural inferences that some other person \r\n    might have committed the offense for which he is on trial, or by fanciful \r\n    analogy to say to the jury that someone other than he is more probably guilty.\r\n\r\nId., 198 S.C. at 104-105, 16 S.E.2d at 535.Â  Further, \r\n  in State v. Gay, 343 S.C. 543, 541 S.E.2d 541 (2001), we held that where \r\n  there is strong evidence of an appellantâ€™s guilt, especially where there is \r\n  strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third partyâ€™s alleged \r\n  guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellantâ€™s own innocence. \r\n\r\nAppellant fails to meet the standard set out in Gregory and Gay \r\n  due to the strong evidence of his guilt.Â  He simply cannot overcome the forensic \r\n  evidence against him to raise a reasonable inference of his own innocence.Â  \r\n  This evidence included:Â  (1) appellantâ€™s palm print was found just above the \r\n  door knob on the interior side of the front door of the victimâ€™s house; (2) \r\n  fibers consistent with a black sweatshirt owned by appellant were found on the \r\n  victimâ€™s bed sheets; (3) matching blue fibers were found on the victimâ€™s pink \r\n  nightgown and on appellantâ€™s blue jeans; (4) microscopically consistent fibers \r\n  were found on the pink nightgown and on appellantâ€™s underwear; (5) appellantâ€™s \r\n  underwear contained a mixture of DNA from two individuals, and 99.99% of the \r\n  population other than appellant and the victim were excluded as contributors \r\n  to that mixture; and (6) appellantâ€™s tank top was found to contain a mixture \r\n  of appellantâ€™s blood and the victimâ€™s blood. \r\n  [8] \r\nFurther, besides the forensic evidence, there was evidence that appellant matched \r\n  the description of the perpetrator given by the victim and there was evidence \r\n  that appellant was fleeing from police officers and was in the area of the victimâ€™s \r\n  house prior to the time she was attacked.\r\nRegarding appellantâ€™s claim that he should have been allowed to present evidence \r\n  that Jimmy White may have been the perpetrator of the crimes, the State proffered \r\n  the testimony of a Federal Bureau of Investigations forensic examiner.Â  This \r\n  examiner testified that, after testing Jimmy Whiteâ€™s specimen, i.e. a \r\n  dried bloodstain, and comparing the specimen to the clothing items that were \r\n  tested as part of the investigation, White was excluded.\r\nGiven the overwhelming evidence of appellantâ€™s guilt, the circuit court did \r\n  not err by excluding the evidence of third party guilt.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellantâ€™s remaining issues are without merit and we dispose of them pursuant \r\n  to Rule 220(b), SCACR.Â  See Issue I:Â  State v. Council, \r\n  335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1050 (1999) (whether \r\n  juror is qualified to serve on death penalty case is within discretion of trial \r\n  court and is not reviewable on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence; \r\n  responses of challenged jurors must be examined in light of entire voir dire); \r\n  Issue IV:Â  State v.

[10] \r\nProportionality Review\r\nUnder State law, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(3) (1985) requires this Court \r\n  to determine in a death case â€œ[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or \r\n  disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the \r\n  crime and the defendant.â€Â  There is no requirement the sentence be proportional \r\n  to any particular case; however, death sentences have been imposed in similar \r\n  cases. Â See State v. Simmons, Â Â Â Â Â S.C. Â Â Â Â , 599 \r\n  S.E.2d 448 (2004); State v. Terry, 339 S.C. 352, 529 S.E.2d 274, cert. \r\n  denied, 531 U.S. 882 (2000); State v.

Whipple, 324 \r\n  S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683, cert denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  appellantâ€™s sentence is not disproportionate under State law.Â  The judgment \r\n  of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, J., and Acting Justice John W. Kittredge, concur.Â  PLEICONES, \r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent, and would find the circuit \r\n  court erred in refusing to allow appellant to introduce evidence of third party \r\n  guilt in the guilt phase of the trial.Â  I would therefore reverse and remand \r\n  for a new trial.\r\nThe majority and I agree on the third party guilt evidence proffered by appellant.Â  \r\n  In my view, the proffer met the standard established by State v. Gregory, \r\n  198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941).Â  The majority, relying on State v. Gay, \r\n  343 S.C. 543, 541 S.E.2d 541 (2001), concludes that the third party guilt evidence \r\n  was properly excluded.Â  I find Gay distinguishable.\r\nIn Gay, the Court affirmed the exclusion of evidence of third party \r\n  guilt because the Stateâ€™s case, particularly the forensic evidence, was so strong \r\n  that it admitted of no â€œreasonable inferenceâ€ regarding the defendantâ€™s innocence.Â  \r\n  The present case is distinguishable from Gay in several important particulars.Â  \r\n  First, the validity of the forensic evidence was not called into question in \r\n  Gay.Â  Here, appellant presented evidence of mishandling, for example \r\n  the collection of evidence at the scene using grocery bags from the victimâ€™s \r\n  kitchen, the mislabeling of samples at the lab, and the loss of all blood samples \r\n  collected from the victim.Â  Further, appellant proffered evidence that representatives \r\n  of the State had admitted manufacturing blood and palm print evidence against \r\n  him.Â  Finally, unlike the defendant in Gay, appellant proffered both \r\n  â€œproximityâ€ witnesses and â€œconfessionâ€ witnesses.Â  Considering the record as \r\n  a whole, the Stateâ€™s evidence was not sufficient to negate the â€œreasonable inferenceâ€ \r\n  of appellantâ€™s innocence arising from appellantâ€™s proffer.\r\nI would reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] This \r\n    was appellantâ€™s second capital trial.Â  His direct appeal from the first trial \r\n    was affirmed, State v. Holmes, 320 S.C. 259, 464 S.E.2d 334 (1995), \r\n    cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1248 (1996); appellant was subsequently granted \r\n    a new trial on post-conviction relief.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] The \r\n    aggravating circumstances were murder during the commission of burglary, murder \r\n    during the commission of CSC, and physical torture.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] The \r\n    imprisonment terms were life for burglary; thirty years for CSC; and fifteen \r\n    years for robbery.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] The \r\n    victim apparently answered Mrs. Thrasherâ€™s call using her bedroom phone.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Appellant \r\n    includes the use of an expired kit in his argument that the forensic evidence \r\n    was compromised.Â  There was evidence, however, that the expiration date is \r\n    a manufacturerâ€™s â€œguessâ€ as to how long the vacuum in the blood collection \r\n    vials will remain good, and that the kit can be used after that date if the \r\n    vacuum remains effective. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] Westbrookâ€™s \r\n    credibility was called into question by cross-examination and by impeachment.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] Boot \r\n    Smith was deceased at the time of this trial.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8] Although \r\n    appellant claims the forensic evidence was mishandled and therefore was inadmissible, \r\n    the fact the forensic evidence may have been compromised by the unprofessional \r\n    manner in which the evidence was collected goes to the weight of the evidence, \r\n    not to its admissibility.Â  See State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, \r\n    544 S.E.2d 835 (2001) (weak links in chain of custody go to weight, not admissibility); \r\n    State v. Smith, 326 S.C. 39, 482 S.E.2d 777 (1997) (storage of blood \r\n    sample in police officerâ€™s home goes to weight of evidence not its admissibility).Â  \r\n    In any event, appellantâ€™s claims do not eviscerate all of the forensic evidence.Â  \r\n    For example, appellantâ€™s claims do not eliminate the fact that consistent \r\n    fibers were found on both his clothing and the victimâ€™s clothing and sheets \r\n    or the fact that 99.99% of the population other than appellant and the victim \r\n    were excluded as contributors to the mixture found in appellantâ€™s underwear.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [9] Overruled \r\n    on other grounds by State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d \r\n    317 (1995).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [10] As \r\n    for Issue XIV, appellantâ€™s argument is based upon a factual error.Â  Appellant \r\n    argues the trial court erred by permitting the State to cross-examine a social \r\n    worker using records from his stay in Gilliam Psychiatric Hospital in 2000.Â  \r\n    However, the trial court in fact denied the Stateâ€™s request to cross-examine \r\n    the social worker and the State did not ask any questions regarding the 2000 \r\n    Gilliam records.Â  Because the Record on Appeal does not support appellantâ€™s \r\n    assertion, we do not address his argument.Â  See State v. Sinclair, \r\n    275 S.C. 608, 274 S.E.2d 411 (1981) (where appellant obtained only relief \r\n    he sought, this court has no issue to decide).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25887","title":"Slezak v.

South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Corrections, 355 S.C. 437, 586 S.E.2d 124 (2003).Â  Further, we \r\n  clarify the jurisdiction of the Administrative Law Judge Division (ALJD) in \r\n  inmate grievance matters.\r\nIn Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000), the Court \r\n  held that inmates could pursue appellate review in the ALJD of certain grievance \r\n  decisions made by the Department of Corrections (DOC).Â  The ALJD responded to \r\n  Al-Shabazz in an en banc order issued September 5, 2001.Â  McNeil \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections.Â  In McNeil, the ALJD purported \r\n  to limit its appellate jurisdiction in inmate appeals to grievances where:\r\n\r\n   1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the contention is that the inmateâ€™s sentence, \r\n    sentence-related credits or custody status have been erroneously calculated, \r\n    or\r\n   2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the inmateâ€™s created liberty interest has been \r\n    taken as punishment in a major disciplinary hearing.\r\n\r\nIn footnote 5 of Sullivan, this Court substantially modified McNeil \r\n  and held:\r\n\r\n  â€¦.the ALJD and the circuit court are instructed to look to this opinion, \r\n    not McNeil, for guidance in future cases.Â  Although much of McNeilâ€™s \r\n    analysis is accurate, we believe Wolff [v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. \r\n    539 (1974)] requires minimal due process when for [sic] state-created liberty \r\n    interests, which are not necessarily limited to sentence credit issues and \r\n    major disciplinary decisions.\r\n\r\nSee also Wicker v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, Op. No. \r\n  25859 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 23, 2004) (recognizing another limited ALJD \r\n  jurisdictional exception where inmate claims deprivation of property interest).\r\nWe now clarify that the ALJD has subject matter jurisdiction to hear appeals \r\n  from the final decision of the DOC in a non-collateral or administrative matter.Â  \r\n  Al-Shabazz, supra.Â Â Â  Subject matter jurisdiction refers to the \r\n  ALJDâ€™s â€œpower to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the \r\n  proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Cf. Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., \r\n  314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598 (1994) (definition of judicial subject matter jurisdiction).Â  \r\n  Further, the ALJD has appellate jurisdiction over any matter where the procedural \r\n  prerequisites for perfecting such an appeal have been met.Â  Great Games, \r\n  Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Rev., 339 S.C. 79, 529 S.E.2d 6 (2000) (appellate \r\n  jurisdiction exists where procedural requirements met).\r\nWhile the ALJD has jurisdiction over all inmate grievance appeals that have \r\n  been properly filed, we emphasize that the Division is not required to hold \r\n  a hearing in every matter.Â  Summary dismissal may be appropriate where the inmateâ€™s \r\n  grievance does not implicate a state-created liberty or property interest.Â  \r\n  See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995) (due process clause \r\n  offended only when inmate subjected to atypical and significant hardships in \r\n  relation to ordinary incidents of prison life).\r\nAppellantâ€™s appeals to the ALJD and to the circuit court were decided prior \r\n  to our opinions in Sullivan and Wicker, and were dismissed as \r\n  beyond the ALJDâ€™s jurisdiction pursuant to the McNeil order.Â  In the \r\n  interest of judicial economy, we will address this appeal on its merits.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Whether the circuit court erred in dismissing appellantâ€™s grievances?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWe address each of appellantâ€™s six grievances below.\r\nAppellant first complained that \r\n  DOC seized certain educational cassette tapes in appellantâ€™s possession.Â  The \r\n  record reveals that the DOC policy denies inmates possession of cassette tapes \r\n  other than tapes of the inmateâ€™s parole hearing(s) or religious tapes obtained \r\n  from the chaplain.Â  We find no protected liberty or property interest implicated \r\n  in the DOCâ€™s decision to declare cassette tapes contraband, and to seize appellantâ€™s \r\n  tapes pursuant to this policy.\r\nAppellant also complains about \r\n  a DOC policy that provides for the loss of â€œgood timeâ€ credits in certain circumstances.Â  \r\n  The record establishes that appellant is not eligible to receive such credits, \r\n  and accordingly lacks standing to challenge the DOC policy.\r\nAppellantâ€™s third complaint relates \r\n  to a DOC policy limiting the amount of legal material he could keep in his cell \r\n  while in administrative segregation.Â  The DOC determined that the retention \r\n  of large amounts of paper in these cells created a fire hazard, and therefore \r\n  permitted an inmate to retain a limited amount in his cell with the remainder \r\n  available upon request.Â  Appellant concedes his materials were returned upon \r\n  his release from administrative segregation to the general population.Â  We find \r\n  this grievance is moot, and that, in any case, the decision to limit papers \r\n  for fire safety reasons does not implicate a protected liberty or property interest.\r\nAppellant also complained because \r\n  DOC confiscated a book sent to him through the mail.Â  Under DOC policy, inmates \r\n  may receive only books mailed to them directly from the publisher for security \r\n  reasons.Â  Appellantâ€™s grievance does not involve a state-created liberty or \r\n  property interest.\r\nAppellant also challenged S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-2-620 (Supp. 2004), which requires \r\n  inmates convicted of certain crimes to submit a DNA sample, and Â§ 23-3-670, \r\n  requiring the person providing the DNA sample to pay a $250 processing fee.Â  \r\n  Appellantâ€™s counsel acknowledged at oral argument that appellant was challenging \r\n  the constitutionality of these statutes, and that such a challenge was properly \r\n  brought as a declaratory judgment action in circuit court rather than through \r\n  the administrative grievance process.Â  See e.g. Great Games, supra; \r\n  Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Rev., 342 S.C. \r\n  34, 535 S.E.2d 642 (2000).Â  This grievance was properly dismissed for lack of \r\n  jurisdiction. [1]  \r\nAppellantâ€™s sixth grievance asserted that the practice of â€œtriple cellingâ€ \r\n  at McCormick Correctional Institute constituted both a security hazard and a \r\n  health hazard to inmates.Â  We find this grievance adequately states a violation \r\n  of appellantâ€™s liberty interest so as to entitle him to a hearing before an \r\n  ALJ.Â  Accordingly, we remand this grievance appeal to the ALJD for further proceedings.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the ALJD has jurisdiction \r\n  over all properly perfected inmate appeals, but clarify that it may summarily \r\n  decide those appeals that do not implicate an inmateâ€™s state-created liberty \r\n  or property interest.Â  We affirm as modified the orders upholding the dismissal \r\n  of five of appellantâ€™s complaints, and reverse and remand the triple celling \r\n  complaint to the ALJD.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Doyet A. \r\n  Early, III, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Our disposition of this grievance is without prejudice \r\n    to appellantâ€™s right to pursue a declaratory judgment action in circuit court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Robert L.

Nevill, of Bluffton, pro se.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  PER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to either an admonition, public reprimand, or definite suspension not to exceed thirty (30) days.Â  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\n  FACTS\r\n  On December 31, 2003, respondent represented Purchaser in a real estate closing.Â  In that transaction, Purchaser was buying investment property from Seller for $240,445.00.Â  Seller was to manage the property for Purchaser.Â  \r\n  Without consulting respondent, Purchaser paid $44,000.00 of her own money to Seller.Â  This payment was not required by the sales contract and was in addition to the $1,000.00 earnest money Purchaser was required to pay under the contract.Â  Purchaserâ€™s understanding was that these funds would be used to pay the balance owed on the purchase of the new property after the loan proceeds ($158,000) and the proceeds of the sale of other investment property owned by Purchaser ($61,014.17).Â  Any excess would be placed in Purchaserâ€™s property management account held by Seller.Â  Purchaser and Seller did not document the payment of the $44,000.00 or the terms of their agreement about its purpose.\r\n  In preparation of the HUD-1 settlement statement, respondent correctly calculated that $27,948.08 of the $44,000.00 would be required for Purchaser to meet the sale price.Â  Respondent should have listed this amount on the â€œSummary of Borrowerâ€™s Transactionâ€ on the HUD-1 as a down payment paid outside of closing (POC).Â  Respondent should have then listed the same amount as an excess deposit POC on the â€œSummary of Sellerâ€™s Transactionâ€ on the HUD-1 and reduced the final amount to Seller by that amount.Â  Instead, respondent added the $27,948.08 to the $1,000 earnest money deposit on line 201 of the HUD-1 and showed that money being paid to Seller at closing.Â  \r\n  Neither Purchaser nor Seller brought $27,948.08 to the closing.Â  Respondent conducted the closing without correcting the HUD-1.Â  As a result, respondent issued a trust account check to Seller for $27,948.08 more than respondent received to fund the closing.Â  \r\n  On January 21, 2004, respondent realized the error when his bank contacted him and informed him there were insufficient funds in his trust account to cover a check issued in a subsequent closing.Â  Respondent immediately transferred $10,000.00 from his personal home equity account into his trust account to cover the check.Â  Upon review of his trust account records, respondent discovered that the error in the December 31, 2003 closing was the source of the shortage.Â  Respondent deposited the remaining amount available from his personal home equity account ($6,000.00) into his trust account, leaving the trust account $11,948.08 short. \r\n  Over the next several months, respondent did not withdraw funds owed to him for fees for subsequent closings in an effort to make up the shortage.Â  Respondent relied on the â€œfloatâ€ from those closings to avoid any losses to clients or returned checks.\r\n  Respondent was able to make up the shortage in full by June 2004.Â  In discussion with the Sellerâ€™s attorney about repayment to respondent for the overpaid funds, it came to respondentâ€™s attention that use of the â€œfloatâ€ in his trust account was in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n  Respondent self-reported this matter to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.Â  He provided Disciplinary Counsel with complete records of the transactions and has fully cooperated in the disciplinary investigation.Â  \r\n  LAW\r\n  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, particularly Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safe keep client property).Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n  PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25889","title":"In the Matter of Michael V.

Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  PER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to either an admonition or a public reprimand.Â  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\n  FACTS[1]\r\n  Matter I\r\n  Respondent was admitted to practice law in 1988.Â  Until approximately March 2003, respondent worked for several law firms, primarily representing plaintiffs or claimants.Â  From March 2003 through April 2004, respondent operated a solo practice in which he handled personal injury cases on a contingency fee basis.Â  \r\n  In connection with his solo practice, respondent failed to maintain accurate or complete client ledgers, a check register or accounting journal, monthly account reconciliations, or any other system to facilitate the reliable identification of clients who had funds in his accounts and the balance of those funds.Â  During that same period, respondent failed to maintain copies or originals of checks written on his operating or trust account.Â  Respondent relied primarily on check stubs, on-line banking, and his own recollection to monitor the flow of funds through his accounts.Â  As a result, respondent was unable to identify client funds remaining in accounts at any given point in time.Â  \r\n   It was respondentâ€™s practice to deposit a client settlement check into his trust account, confirm that the check had cleared, and then electronically transfer the funds from the trust account to his operating account.Â  Respondent then disbursed funds to and on behalf of clients from the operating account.Â  This practice was based on respondentâ€™s erroneous belief that his former employer, a more experienced attorney, processed settlements in this matter.Â  \r\n  Respondent left a portion of his fees from client settlements in his trust account as a cushion.Â  Respondentâ€™s remaining fees from settlement funds often remained in his operating account for his use in connection with operating his law office and for his personal use.Â  Respondent failed to maintain records to ensure an accurate accounting of his accumulated fees in the trust account and the operating account.Â  Although no client or client creditor has complained that payment was not received, respondent acknowledges that he should have processed client settlements using only his trust account and that his deposit of client funds and earned fees into his operating account constituted commingling.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Respondent prepared and negotiated eight operating account checks payable to cash.Â  Additionally, respondent used a debit or cash card to pay office expenses, to purchase personal items, and to make cash withdrawals from the operating account.Â  Respondent acknowledges that, because it contained client funds, his operating account was a de facto trust account and that it was improper to make disbursements from that account in cash.Â  Respondentâ€™s cash transactions and payments for office expenses and personal items were made from what respondent believed to be earned fees remaining in his operating account.Â  Although there is no indication respondent misappropriated client funds, he acknowledges that his lack of proper accounting and documentation raised a question of misappropriation and impaired his ability to confirm the integrity of client funds.\r\n  On at least six occasions, respondent negotiated client settlement checks for cash without depositing them into his trust account.Â  Respondent failed to accurately and completely account for remittances of cash to these clients and to himself.Â  Although respondent did this as an accommodation to his clients and no client has complained of not receiving funds due, respondent acknowledges that it was inappropriate to make these disbursements in cash and to handle these settlements outside his trust account. \r\n  In addition to reporting this matter to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, respondent retained an accountant with experience in law firm accounting.Â  Respondentâ€™s accounts have now been reconciled and all client funds have been accounted for and properly disbursed.Â  Respondent represents he now has in place accounting and recordkeeping practices that are fully compliant with the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\n  Matter II\r\n  Of the approximately one hundred client files opened by respondent from March 2003 to April 2004, approximately seventy were referrals from other attorneys.Â  These files were referred to respondent for the purpose of litigation and/or final settlement.Â  Respondentâ€™s general agreement with the referring attorneys was to split any fees recovered on a fifty-fifty basis.Â  Respondent acknowledges that this fee-splitting arrangement was not necessarily in proportion to the amount of work performed by each attorney and, therefore, a written agreement with the client in which both attorneys acknowledged full responsibility for the matter was required.Â  Although the clients did consent to the referrals and no client has complained about the fee sharing arrangement, respondent and his referring attorney did not enter into the required written agreements with the clients regarding each attorneyâ€™s responsibility for the matters in violation of Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  \r\n  LAW\r\n  Respondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.5 (division of fees between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if the division is made in proportion to the services performed by each attorney or, by written agreement with the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation) and Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients in his possession separately from the lawyerâ€™s own property).Â  In addition, respondent agrees he has violated Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent acknowledges his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  We find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n  PUBLIC REPRIMAND.Â Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1] Both matters were initiated by respondentâ€™s self-report.Â  \r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25890","title":"In the Matter of Verdell

Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as surrendering papers to which client is entitled); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of the client); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not fail to respond to lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is processional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n  PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Â He went to his office in Savannah that morning where he saw patients as a child psychologist.Â  Because his car was being repaired, his wife drove him to work.Â  Between 10:30 and 11:00 a.m., Dr. Cox borrowed a colleagueâ€™s car to go to a dentist appointment.Â  The car was a nearly-new BMW Z3 two-seater, a car Dr. Cox had never borrowed before.Â  \r\n  Dr. Cox never returned to the office.Â  At about 1:20 p.m., he called his secretary and she cancelled his remaining appointments.Â  Dr. Cox withdrew money from an ATM at a Hardeeville bank that day.[2]Â  His wife paged him every half-hour from about 2:30 until 5:30 p.m. without success.Â  She then filed a missing persons report.Â  \r\n  Shortly thereafter, Dr. Coxâ€™s office manager discovered a floppy disk marked â€œpersonalâ€ lying on Dr. Coxâ€™s computer.Â  After viewing the data contained on the disk, she contacted police.Â  The information on the disk included the name of Bobby Ray Ware who was subsequently interviewed by police.\r\n  Ware was the Stateâ€™s chief witness at trial.Â  He testified he was employed as a long-distance truck driver and lived in Savannah.Â  He had had a sexual relationship with Dr. Cox for more than a year but knew him only by the name â€œJay.â€Â  They first met at a rest area on I-95 when â€œJayâ€ performed oral sex on him.Â  After that, â€œJayâ€ would come to Wareâ€™s house about once a week for sex.Â  Because Ware knew â€œJayâ€ liked to have sex with truckers, on the weekend of June 14-15 he introduced â€œJayâ€ to respondent who was staying with Ware.Â  That weekend, â€œJayâ€ and respondent had sex at Wareâ€™s house.Â  Ware also testified he had seen respondent in possession of a gun while respondent was staying with him. \r\n  Ware left at 6:00 a.m. the following Tuesday, June 17, to drive to Chicago.Â  Respondent was still staying at Wareâ€™s residence.Â  On June 19, Ware received a message from respondent to call him at a phone number in Tennessee.Â  Ware later contacted respondent at a phone number identified as belonging to respondentâ€™s father who lived in Gray, Tennessee.Â  \r\n  Meanwhile, on June 20, the borrowed BMW was found in a parking lot in Johnson City, Tennessee.Â  There was no blood in the car.Â  When recovered, it had some unspecified scratches on it.Â  The only evidence found in the car was a fingerprint on a tab from a coffee cup lid found in the center compartment between the seats.Â  The fingerprint was identified as respondentâ€™s right thumbprint.Â  \r\n  Respondent was arrested at his fatherâ€™s house in Tennessee on June 27.Â  The Stateâ€™s theory of the case was that respondent and Dr. Cox drove to the woods where respondent shot Dr. Cox while Dr. Cox was kneeling â€œeither by force or for sex.â€Â  Respondent then drove the car to Tennessee and stopped for coffee on the way.Â  \r\n  ISSUE\r\n  \r\n    Was there any substantial evidence to submit the case to the jury?\r\n  \r\n  DISCUSSION\r\n  The Court of Appeals majority found there was no substantial evidence to submit the case to the jury and a directed verdict of acquittal should have been granted.Â  \r\n  The trial court has a duty to submit the case to the jury where the evidence is circumstantial if there is substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000); State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996).Â  Unless there is a total failure of competent evidence as to the charges alleged, refusal by the trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal is not error. Â State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d 195 (1978).Â  The trial judge should grant a directed verdict, however, when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Martin, supra. Â On appeal of the denial of a directed verdict of acquittal, we must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Martin, supra; State v. Williams, supra. \r\n  Viewing the evidence most favorably to the State, respondentâ€™s fingerprint on the coffee cup lid tab establishes he was in the borrowed BMW on the same day the victim was last seen alive.Â  The fact that the BMW was found abandoned in Tennessee, the same state where respondent was located after his stay in Savannah, raises a suspicion of guilt[3] but is not evidence that respondent killed Dr. Cox.Â  Further, there is no evidence respondent was at the scene of the crime, which according to the Stateâ€™s theory was in Colleton County.Â  See State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000); State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984) (directed verdict should have been granted where there was no substantial evidence establishing defendantâ€™s presence at scene of murder).Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly reversed the denial of a directed verdict of acquittal.\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  WALLER AND PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n  \r\n  CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the State presented sufficient evidence to warrant the trial judgeâ€™s denial of respondentâ€™s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.Â Â  \r\n  The events in this case occurred within a few days.Â  The victim was found dead on June 21 in Colleton County, off an access road that had rough terrain and overgrown brush.Â  The coroner estimated that the victim had been murdered on June 18.Â  Just days before the murder, on June 14-15, respondent and the victim met for the first time, in Savannah, and the two had sex.Â  Respondent was in town visiting Bobby Ray Ware, a truck driver who had a sexual relationship with the victim for over a year.Â  According to Ware, Respondent was carrying a gun.\r\n  Ware left town for Chicago on the morning of June 17.Â  Respondent stayed behind at Wareâ€™s residence.Â  The next morning, June 18, the victim borrowed a nearly new BMW from one of his colleagues.Â  He withdrew $300 from an ATM in Hardeeville, near Colleton County.Â  Later, the victim was murdered by gunshot.Â  When his body was found, he was still wearing a watch and a gold ring, but his wallet and cash were missing.Â  \r\n  On June 19, the very next day, respondent left Ware a phone message, asking Ware to call him in Tennessee.Â  On June 20, the BMW was found in Tennessee, near respondentâ€™s fatherâ€™s home.Â  The lead investigator reported that the exterior of the BMW had scratches on it, â€œlike it had been [driven] down something rough.â€Â  Respondentâ€™s thumbprint was found on a coffee cup lid left in the car.Â  \r\n  Given the short timeframe within which these events occurred; the sexual relationship between the victim and respondent; the thumbprint evidence in the borrowed BMW; the scratches on the car; and the location of the abandoned car in Tennessee, near the place respondent was staying, there was enough evidence, in my view, from which respondentâ€™s guilt could be fairly and logically deduced.[4]Â  See State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000) (the trial judge must submit the case to the jury if there is â€œany substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deducedâ€).\r\n  Therefore, in my view, the court of appeals erred in reversing respondentâ€™s conviction.Â  \r\n  BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]State v. Arnold, 351 S.C. 302, 569 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\n\r\n\r\n  [2] Hardeeville is located along I-95 in Jasper County between Savannah and Colleton County. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [3]We note there is no evidence in the record establishing the distance between respondentâ€™s fatherâ€™s home and the site where the BMW was found.Â  Rand McNallyâ€™s Road Atlas indicates Gray, Tennessee, is about ten miles from Johnson City, Tennessee. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [4] It is also my view that had this case been submitted to the jury, respondent would have been entitled to the traditional circumstantial evidence charge as described in State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 895 (1989). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25893","title":"State v.

Cabrera-Pena, 350 S.C. 517, 567 S.E.2d 472 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  We affirm in result. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 30, 1999, \r\n  Reyes Cabrera-Pena (Cabrera-Pena) went to an Applebeeâ€™s restaurant in Spartanburg \r\n  where his estranged wife Alma was dining with three of her friends and the couplesâ€™ \r\n  two-year-old daughter, Melissa.Â  According to the only direct evidence, the \r\n  testimony of Almaâ€™s friends, Cabrera-Pena and Alma went outside and argued briefly; \r\n  Cabrera-Pena then left.Â  \r\nAfter he left the restaurant, \r\n  Cabrera-Pena purchased a gun for $30.00.Â  He then went back to the restaurant \r\n  and sat in his van in the parking lot, waiting for Alma to come out.Â  As Alma \r\n  and her friends left the restaurant around midnight, they spotted Cabrera-Penaâ€™s \r\n  van in the parking lot; Cabrera-Pena flashed his lights and Alma walked toward \r\n  his van.Â  After speaking to him for several minutes, Alma began walking towards \r\n  her friendsâ€™ pickup truck, followed by Cabrera-Pena.Â  She motioned to her friends \r\n  that he had a gun.Â  Cabrera-Pena told the group that he was taking Melissa and \r\n  Alma with him.Â  Alma refused to go and Cabrera-Pena pulled the gun and pointed \r\n  it at her as she held Melissa on her hip.Â  Alma put her hand on his wrist and \r\n  pushed the gun down.Â  Cabrera-Pena lifted the gun and pointed it at her head. \r\n  As Alma backed away, still holding her child, Cabrera-Pena shot her in the \r\n  right eye.Â  Both Alma and Melissa fell to the ground.Â  Cabrera-Pena pointed \r\n  the weapon at each of Almaâ€™s three friends, but then threw the gun over a fence, \r\n  ran back to his van and drove away.Â  Cabrera-Pena was arrested a short time \r\n  later. \r\nAfter his arrest, Cabrera-Pena \r\n  was taken to an interview where two detectives, Officer Morrow and Officer Taylor, \r\n  initially questioned him.Â  When it became apparent that Cabrera-Pena was not \r\n  fluent in English, they called in Officer Tony Membreno, who was fluent in Spanish \r\n  to assist them in questioning Cabrera-Pena.Â  At trial, Officer Membreno testified \r\n  that, after reading him his rights, Cabrera-Pena blurted out, â€œIâ€™m guilty.Â  \r\n  I fully accept everything that had happened and Iâ€™m responsible for it.â€Â  Membreno \r\n  then began referring to his notes from the interview.Â  According to Membreno, \r\n  Cabrera-Pena told him that when he left Applebeeâ€™s the first time, he dropped \r\n  his friend Juan at home, purchased some beer and, on his way home, he found \r\n  a person from whom he purchased a gun for $30.00.Â  After that, Cabrera-Pena \r\n  said he then went back to Applebeeâ€™s, parked his van and waited for his wife.Â  \r\n  Two hours later, his wife came out and, after they talked, they walked back \r\n  to her friends. Â Â He told Membreno that, before he got out of his van, \r\n  he had put the gun in his pants between his belt and his shirt.Â  Cabrera-Pena \r\n  told him that when the shot was fired, he got scared and threw the gun away \r\n  behind a fence and left in the van.Â Â Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, \r\n  Cabrera-Pena, who was proceeding pro se, handed Membreno a document and \r\n  inquired whether Membreno had signed it and given it to him.Â  The document contained \r\n  Cabrera-Penaâ€™s written statement to the police, which included his statement: \r\n  â€œI do not know how she took the gun out of my pants pocket.Â  I tried to grab \r\n  and force her, but the gun went off and fired.â€&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nThe following colloquy occurred \r\n  out of the presence of the jury:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         The Court:Â &nbsp;\r\n         The State has objected to any statement that was \r\n  made by you that tends to be in your favor.Â  You may remain silent or you may \r\n  tell the jury about this, but you may not ask this witness about this statement, \r\n  this part of it.Â Â Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Cabrera-Pena:\r\n         \r\n  Why canâ€™t I?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         The Court:\r\n         You either have to testify or remain silent.Â  If \r\n  you are permitted to ask him to read this part of the statement, then you are \r\n  testifying through another witness, which is not permitted.Â  Do you understand?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Cabrera-Pena:&nbsp;\r\n         Itâ€™s the same thing that I said that \r\n  I signed.Â  Itâ€™s the same thing.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         The Court:Â \r\n         You may testify or remain silent, but you may \r\n  not ask this witness what you said to defend yourself. (Emphasis supplied).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe jury was charged \r\n  with the law of murder and voluntary manslaughter, possession of a firearm during \r\n  the commission of a violent crime, and three counts of pointing and presenting \r\n  a firearm.Â  During its deliberations, the jury inquired as to whether Cabrera-Penaâ€™s \r\n  statement of his guilt to Membreno was admissible as evidence and inquired as \r\n  to why it did not have Cabrera-Penaâ€™s statement.Â  Thereafter, the jury requested \r\n  to re-hear the testimony of Officer Membreno and requested to be recharged on \r\n  the law of manslaughter.Â  After lengthy deliberation and an Allen \r\n  [1]  charge, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts.Â  Cabrera-Pena \r\n  was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and concurrent terms of five years \r\n  for each of three pointing a firearm offenses. \r\nOn appeal, Cabrera-Pena \r\n  asserted the trial court erred in prohibiting him from questioning Officer Membreno \r\n  about his statement made to the officer that his wife had somehow gotten \r\n  the gun out of his pants pocket and it had gone off.Â  He contended the â€œrule \r\n  of completenessâ€ and fundamental fairness demanded he be allowed to put his \r\n  statement into context.Â  The Court of Appeals disagreed.Â  State v. Cabrera-Pena, \r\n  350 S.C. 517, 567 S.E.2d 472 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err \r\n  in ruling Cabrera-Pena was not entitled to cross-examine Officer Membreno concerning \r\n  the self-serving portions of the statements he made to the officer?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-Serving Statement  \r\nThe trial court ruled \r\n  Cabrera-Penaâ€™s self-serving statement made to Officer Membreno was not \r\n  a proper subject for cross-examination.Â  The Court of Appeals agreed, finding \r\n  Cabrera-Penaâ€™s statements to Membreno were not admissible under either Rule \r\n  106, SCRE, or under this Courtâ€™s opinions in State v. Jackson, 265 S.C. \r\n  278, 217 S.E.2d 794 (1975) or State v. Terry, 339 S.C. 352, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  274 (2002), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 882 (2000).Â  \r\nInitially, we note \r\n  that, at oral argument before this Court, counsel for Cabrera-Pena indicated \r\n  that this Courtâ€™s opinion in State v. Terry is being read as requiring \r\n  exclusion of the exculpatory portions of a defendantâ€™s statement under any and \r\n  all circumstances.Â  Such a reading misconstrues the holding in Terry.Â  \r\n\r\n Terry involves \r\n  the issue of whether a statement against penal interest may be admitted by a \r\n  non-testifying defendant pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE.Â  There, we held that \r\n  Terry, who had elected not to testify, could not thereafter admit the self-serving \r\n  statement he made to the police.Â  The rationale for this holding, however, was \r\n  that a defendant may not claim â€œunavailabilityâ€ as a witness by virtue of exercising \r\n  his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination.Â  Terry stands \r\n  only for the proposition that such an exculpatory statement may not be admitted \r\n  by a non-testifying defendant pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3).Â  However, this does \r\n  not mean that the exculpatory statement of a non-testifying defendant is inadmissible \r\n  under any and all circumstances.Â  Indeed, we find the statement in the present \r\n  case was admissible pursuant to State v. Jackson, 265 S.C. 278, 284, \r\n  217 S.E.2d 794, 797 (1975).\r\nIn State v. Jackson, \r\n  it was held:\r\n\r\nWhen part of a conversation is \r\n  put into evidence, an adverse party is entitled to prove the remainder of the \r\n  conversation, so long as it is relevant, particularly when it explains or gives \r\n  new meaning to the part initially recited.Â  â€œAll statements made in a conversation, \r\n  in relation to the same subject or matter, are to be supposed to have been intended \r\n  to explain or qualify each other, and therefore the plainest principles of \r\n  justice requires that if one of the statements is to be used against the party, \r\n  all of the other statements tending to explain it or to qualify this use should \r\n  be shown and considered in connection with it.â€Â  \r\n\r\n265 S.C. at 284, 217 S.E.2d \r\n  at 797 (emphasis supplied; internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nHere, Cabrera-Pena \r\n  was interviewed during a one-hour period at 4:00 a.m.Â  During this interview, \r\n  he made oral statements to Officer Membreno and gave a written statement.Â  At \r\n  trial, the state elected, notwithstanding an abundance of eyewitness testimony, \r\n  to call Officer Membreno to the stand and question him concerning the statements \r\n  made to him by Cabrera-Pena.Â  The trial court then prohibited Cabrera-Pena from \r\n  cross-examining Membreno as to the remaining self-serving statements made to \r\n  Membreno.Â  This was error.Â  \r\nOfficer Membreno testified \r\n  as to his conversation with Cabrera-Pena, referring to his notes from the interview.Â  \r\n  Membreno testified that Cabrera-Pena blurted out that he was guilty and went \r\n  on to give him the details of the evening.Â Â Â  Thereafter, when Cabrera-Pena \r\n  attempted to cross-examine Membreno concerning the contents of his report of \r\n  their conversation, he was prohibited from doing so. [2] Â  Under Jackson, once the \r\n  state elected to utilize Officer Membrenoâ€™s testimony to elicit incriminating \r\n  statements made by Cabrera-Pena, justice required that his remaining statements \r\n  tending to explain or qualify those statements should have been considered in \r\n  connection therewith.Â  Accordingly, we find Cabrera-Penaâ€™s cross-examination \r\n  of Membreno was improperly limited.\r\nWe find the stateâ€™s \r\n  assertion of a distinction between the written and oral conversations in this \r\n  case to be one without a difference.Â  As noted previously, Officer Membreno \r\n  testified on direct examination from his notes concerning the substance of his \r\n  conversation with Cabrera-Pena.Â  Cabrera-Pena then attempted to cross-examine \r\n  Membreno regarding the contents of the report of that conversation.Â  This is \r\n  not a case in which the defendant gave numerous written and oral statements \r\n  to police over several hours, days or weeks.Â  To the contrary, this was a one-hour \r\n  conversation with police wherein Cabrera-Pena â€œgave a statement - a written \r\n  statement and vocal statements.â€Â  We find that fundamental fairness requires \r\n  that Cabrera-Pena be permitted to cross-examine Officer Membreno concerning \r\n  the entirety of their conversation.Â  Jackson, supra.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we hold the Court of Appeals erred in holding Cabrera-Pena was not entitled \r\n  to cross-examine Membreno.\r\nFurther, we take this \r\n  opportunity to clarify for the bench and bar the application of Rule \r\n  106, SCRE.Â  Rule 106 provides:\r\n\r\nWhen a writing, or recorded statement, \r\n  or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction \r\n  at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which \r\n  ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that \r\n  Rule 106, by its terms, applies only to written or recorded statements.Â  As \r\n  we noted in State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 170, 508 S.E.2d 870, 876 (1998), \r\n  Rule 106 is based on the rule of completeness and seeks to avoid the unfairness \r\n  inherent in the misleading impression created by taking matters out of context.Â  \r\n  We stated:\r\n\r\nRule 106 [of the Federal Rules \r\n  of Evidence] is a procedural device governing the timing of completion evidence; \r\n  the Rule is â€˜primarily designed to affect the order of proofâ€™.Â  It means that \r\n  the adverse party need not wait until cross-examination or rebuttal.Â  As such, \r\n  the Rule reduces the risk that a writing or recording will be taken out of context \r\n  and that an initial misleading impression will take hold in the mind of the \r\n  jury.Â  \r\n\r\nId. (citing S. \r\n  Saltzburg, M. Martin &amp; D. Capra, Federal Rules of Evidence Manual, \r\n  98-99 (1998)).Â  The Historical Notes to Rule 106 recognize, however, that adoption \r\n  of the â€œrule does not change the order of proof as to the remainder of an \r\n  unrecorded conversation; the party seeking to bring out the remainder must \r\n  do so during cross-examination or during that party's case.â€Â  (Emphasis supplied).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Rule 106 merely requires that an oral or unrecorded conversation \r\n  be brought out upon cross-examination, rather than on direct examination; the \r\n  rule does not, however, prohibit introduction of oral statements or otherwise \r\n  vitiate the rule of completeness as it applies to such statements.Â  \r\nWe find the common \r\n  law of this state extends the rule of completeness to oral communications.Â  \r\n  Jackson, supra.Â  Accord State v. Eugenio, 579 N.W.2d \r\n  642 (Wis. 1998) (notwithstanding provision identical to Rule 106 referring only \r\n  to written or recorded statements, common law rule of completeness continues \r\n  to exist for oral statements); State v. Cruz-Meza, 76 P.3d 1165 (Utah \r\n  2003) (recognizing rule of completeness may be applied to oral statements through \r\n  Rule 611); [3]  State v. Johnson, 479 A.2d 1284 (Maine \r\n  1984).Â  See also United States v. Haddad, 10 F.3d 1252 (7th \r\n  Cir. 1993) (citing 1 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Weinstein's Evidence, Â§ \r\n  106-4 (1992).Â  Accordingly, where, as here, the state elects to use a witness \r\n  to elicit portions of a conversation (and incriminating statements therein) \r\n  made by a defendant, the rule of completeness requires the defendant \r\n  be permitted to inquire into the full substance of that conversation. \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHarmless ErrorÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  \r\nAlthough we find Cabrera-Pena \r\n  should have been permitted to cross-examine Membreno concerning the remainder \r\n  of what Cabrera-Pena said in his conversation during the interview, we find \r\n  this error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the overwhelming evidence \r\n  of guilt in this case.Â  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 \r\n  (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 927 (1993) (error is harmless beyond a \r\n  reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained).Â  We make \r\n  this determination fully cognizant of the rule that if any evidence exists to \r\n  warrant the jury charge of the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, \r\n  then the charge must be given.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 265, \r\n  513 S.E.2d 104,109 (1999).Â Â  \r\nUnder the facts in \r\n  the instant case, Cabrera-Pena was not entitled to the charge on the lesser-included \r\n  offense of involuntary manslaughter as a matter of law.Â  Involuntary manslaughter \r\n  is defined as either:\r\n\r\n(1) the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but while one \r\n  is engaged in the commission of some unlawful act not amounting to a felony \r\n  and not tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the killing of another \r\n  without malice unintentionally, but while one is acting lawfully with reckless \r\n  disregard of the safety of others. â€¦Â  Again, the pivotal issue is whether Appellant \r\n  was engaged in a lawful activity at the time of the killing.Â  \r\n\r\nId. 334 S.C. at 264-265, 513 S.E.2d at 109. \r\nWe find that Cabrera-Penaâ€™s \r\n  conduct -- leaving Alma at Applebeeâ€™s and purchasing a handgun; loading the \r\n  handgun; returning to the Applebeeâ€™s parking lot to wait for Alma to exit the \r\n  restaurant; calling her over to his van after she exited the restaurant; showing \r\n  Alma the gun and then walking her back over to the truck where the friends were \r\n  standing, prompting Alma to motion to them that he had a gun; and finally, shooting \r\n  her in the eye, killing her -- is not the type of conduct contemplated under \r\n  either definition of involuntary manslaughter.\r\nCabrera-Penaâ€™s conduct \r\n  does not fit within the first definition of involuntary manslaughter because \r\n  he was engaged in unlawful, felonious and harmful conduct.Â  At minimum, he used \r\n  the loaded pistol to intimidate Alma and forcefully walk her over to the pickup \r\n  truck where her friends were.Â  This conduct may be considered felonious under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410 (1976) (pointing or presenting a firearm) or S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (1976) (kidnapping). [4] Â  Further, we note that Cabrera-Pena \r\n  was convicted of three counts of the felony of pointing and presenting a firearm, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410, as he pointed the pistol at Almaâ€™s three friends \r\n  after he shot Alma and before he fled the scene.Â  \r\nCabrera-Penaâ€™s conduct \r\n  also does not fit within the penumbra of the second definition of involuntary \r\n  manslaughter.Â  Cabrera-Pena was acting unlawfully when he took advantage of \r\n  the unfair and extremely dangerous situation that he created by bringing a loaded, \r\n  deadly weapon into a domestic dispute in a public place.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nMoreover, this is \r\n  not a type of involuntary manslaughter case where â€œa person can be acting lawfully, \r\n  even if he is in unlawful possession of a weapon, if he was entitled to arm \r\n  himself in self defense at the time of the shooting.â€Â  State v. Crosby, \r\n  335 S.C. 47, 52, 584 S.E.2d 104, 112 (2003) (emphasis supplied) (citing Burriss, \r\n  334 S.C. at 256, 584 S.E.2d at 110).Â  Cabrera-Pena presented no evidence that \r\n  he was acting in self-defense.Â  \r\nThe dissent would \r\n  hold, however, that mere â€œevidence of negligent handling of a loaded gun will \r\n  support a charge of involuntary manslaughter.â€ Burriss, 334 S.C. at 265, \r\n  513 S.E.2d at 109; State v. White, 253 S.C. 475, 479, 171 S.E.2d 712, \r\n  714 (1969). [5] Â Â  \r\nIn Burriss, \r\n  the question was, as here, whether the defendant was entitled to have the lesser-included \r\n  offense of involuntary manslaughter submitted to the jury.Â  According to Burriss, \r\n  Kenneth and James were smoking crack laced marijuana cigarettes, â€œgetting crazy \r\n  or something,â€ when they threatened to rob him.Â  After being physically attacked \r\n  and thrown to the ground, Burriss drew his gun and Kenneth ran into a house \r\n  â€œlike he was getting something.â€Â  Burriss was afraid it was a gun. When James \r\n  began moving threateningly toward Burriss, Burriss snatched his gun up and it \r\n  fired, killing Kenneth. 334 S.C. at 263, 513 S.E.2d at 108.Â  This Court found \r\n  that â€œthe evidence in the record supports Appellantâ€™s claim he was acting \r\n  lawfully when the gun fired.â€Â  Id. at 265, 513 S.E.2d at 109 (emphasis \r\n  supplied).Â  \r\nThe unlawful possession of a firearm does not preclude a charge of \r\n  accident if the accused was engaged in a lawful activity at the time of the \r\n  killing.Â Â  State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 440 S.E.2d 370 (1994).Â  However, \r\n  the â€œunlawful possession of a firearm can under certain circumstances constitute \r\n  an unlawful activity so as to preclude an accident defense if it is the proximate \r\n  cause of the killing.â€ Burriss, 334 S.C. at 262, 513 S.E.2d at 108 n. \r\n  5.Â  The same reasoning applies in the context of involuntary manslaughter, and \r\n  â€œa person can be acting lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession of a \r\n  weapon, if he was entitled to arm himself in self-defense at the time of the \r\n  shooting.â€Â  Id. at 265, 513 S.E.2d at 109. [6] Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe dissent duly notes that this Court does not sit as a finder of \r\n  fact to determine the believability of Cabrera-Penaâ€™s statement.Â Â  But this \r\n  Court must determine as a matter of law whether that statement would have entitled \r\n  Cabrera-Pena to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in this case.Â  State \r\n  v. Tyler, 348 S.C. 526, 560 S.E.2d 888 (2002).Â  It is patent that Cabrera-Penaâ€™s \r\n  conduct in arming himself with a deadly weapon, to lay in wait for his wife, \r\n  so that he could confront her, was not a lawful activity and, indeed, created \r\n  a highly volatile and incendiary domestic situation that resulted in Almaâ€™s \r\n  death.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, Cabrera-Pena was not entitled to an involuntary \r\n  manslaughter charge.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe REVERSE \r\n  the ruling of the Court of Appeals that an adverse party is not permitted to \r\n  bring out, during cross-examination, remaining portions of an unrecorded conversation \r\n  or oral statement made by the adverse party for the purpose of clarifying or \r\n  explaining an entire conversation. Jackson, supra. If the statement \r\n  is in writing or recorded, the adverse party may require the introduction of \r\n  the relevant portions -- at the time of introduction of other portions of the \r\n  statement -- pursuant to Rule 106, SCRE.Â Â  We hold that Cabrera-Pena should, \r\n  in fairness, have been allowed to cross-examine Officer Membreno to fully place \r\n  into context the substance of their conversation.Â  Accordingly, to the extent \r\n  the Court of Appeals held otherwise, its opinion is reversed. \r\nWe, nonetheless, affirm \r\n  in result because we find there was overwhelming direct evidence of Cabrera-Penaâ€™s \r\n  guilt of the offense of murder such that any error in the limitation of Cabrera-Penaâ€™s \r\n  cross-examination was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  \r\nREVERSED IN PART; \r\n  AFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\n TOAL, C.J., and \r\n  BURNETT, J., concur.Â  MOORE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, \r\n  J., concurs.\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I agree the trial \r\n  court erred in refusing to admit appellantâ€™s statement in its entirety, but \r\n  I would not find this error harmless.\r\nThe majority relies on evidence from the Stateâ€™s witnesses to conclude appellant \r\n  was not entitled to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.Â  Under appellantâ€™s \r\n  version of the facts, however, he was entitled to such a charge.Â  The excluded \r\n  part of appellantâ€™s statement was:Â  â€œI do not know how she took the gun out \r\n  of my pants pocket.Â  I tried to grab and force her, but the gun went off and \r\n  fired.â€ [7] Â  Because this critical \r\n  part of appellantâ€™s statement would have entitled him to a charge of involuntary \r\n  manslaughter, the error in its exclusion cannot be harmless.Â  See State \r\n  v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 265, 513 S.E.2d 104, 109 (1999) (evidence of negligent \r\n  handling of a loaded gun will support a charge of involuntary manslaughter); \r\n  State v. White, 253 S.C. 475, 479, 171 S.E.2d 712, 714 (1969) (same).Â  \r\n\r\nAs stated by the majority, involuntary manslaughter is defined as either:\r\n\r\n(1) the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but while one \r\n  is engaged in the commission of some unlawful act not amounting to a felony \r\n  and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the killing \r\n  of another without malice and unintentionally, but while one is acting lawfully \r\n  with reckless disregard of the safety of others.Â Â  \r\n\r\nBurriss, 334 S.C. at 264-65, 513 S.E.2d at 109.Â  Here, there is no evidence \r\n  appellant unlawfully possessed the weapon. [8] Â  Even if appellant was acting unlawfully in \r\n  carrying a concealed weapon, this conduct is not a felony \r\n  [9]  such that it would preclude a charge of involuntary manslaughter, nor \r\n  is it an activity in itself â€œtending to cause death or great bodily harm.â€Â  \r\n  To preclude a charge of involuntary manslaughter, the unlawful possession of \r\n  a weapon must be the proximate cause of the killing.Â  Id. at 262, 513 \r\n  S.E.2d at 108, n.5.Â  Under appellantâ€™s version of the facts, his possession \r\n  of the gun was not the proximate cause of the victimâ€™s death since the gun was \r\n  removed from his pocket only when the victim herself grabbed it.Â  \r\nThis Court does not sit as a finder of fact.Â  It was for the jury to determine \r\n  whether appellantâ€™s version of the shooting was believable or not.Had appellantâ€™s statement been admitted in full, it \r\n  would have entitled him to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  I would reverse.\r\nPLEICONES, J., \r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, \r\n    17 S. Ct. 154 (1896).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  The omitted portion of Cabrera-Penaâ€™s statement \r\n    was that â€œI do not know how she took the gun out of my pants pocket.Â  I tried \r\n    to grab and force her, but the gun went off and fired.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] Â  Rule 611(a) provides that the court shall exercise \r\n    reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and \r\n    presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective \r\n    for the ascertainment of the truth.Â  SCRE 611(a) is identical to the federal \r\n    rule.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  See also S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 16-25-65 (Supp. 2003), â€œCriminal Domestic Violence of a High and Aggravated \r\n    Natureâ€ as amended by 2003 Act No. 92, Â§ 3, eff. January 1, 2004 (a person \r\n    who commits â€œan assault and battery which involves the use of a deadly weaponâ€ \r\n    or â€œan assault, with or without an accompanying battery, which would reasonably \r\n    cause a person to fear imminent serious bodily injury or deathâ€ is guilty \r\n    of a felony).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  In her well-reasoned dissent in State v. Reese, \r\n    359 S.C. 260, 280, 597 S.E.2d 169, 179 (Ct. App. 2004), Chief Judge Hearn \r\n    of the Court of Appeals points out that while White cites this as a \r\n    proposition of law, the issue in White did not hinge on this analysis \r\n    but rather whether the trial judge erred in permitting a murder indictment \r\n    to go to the jury when the only offense charged was involuntary manslaughter.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  As noted in Burriss, â€œ[t]here is a difference \r\n    being lawfully armed in self-defense and acting in self-defense.â€Â  \r\n    334 S.C. at 265, 513 S.E.2d at 109 n. 10 (emphasis supplied). Â In this \r\n    case, there is no evidence Cabrera-Pena â€œwas engaged in a lawful activity \r\n    at the time of the killingâ€ so as to have entitled him to be armed.Â  Id.Â  \r\n    Nevertheless, the dissent would find â€œthere is no evidence Cabrera-Pena was \r\n    unlawfully carrying a weaponâ€ because there is an exception for those persons \r\n    with a permit from SLED from the express provision that â€œ[i]t is unlawful \r\n    to carry about the person any pistol, whether concealed or not.â€ S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 16-23-20(12) (2003).Â  This is notwithstanding that the â€œstatute clearly \r\n    states that it is unlawful to carry a pistol, and the exceptions are not descriptive \r\n    of the offense.Â  This Court holds the view that the state is not required \r\n    to negate each exception to the offense of unlawfully carrying a pistol to \r\n    sustain its burden of proof.â€Â  State v. Clarke, 302 S.C. 423, 425, \r\n    396 S.E.2d 827, 828 (1990).Â  Without addressing whether or not SLED was granting \r\n    permits that night, we find that Cabrera-Pena was not simply carrying a weapon; \r\n    he was carrying the weapon for the purpose of laying in wait in order to confront \r\n    his wife.Â  The subsequent confrontation that ensued illustrated that Cabrera-Pena \r\n    had every intention of using the gun. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] Eyewitnesses \r\n    testified the victim put her hand on appellantâ€™s wrist but she backed away \r\n    before the gun was fired.Â  Appellant referred to this testimony in closing \r\n    argument and maintained the shooting was an accident.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [8] The majority cites S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-20 (2003) \r\n    for the proposition that it is unlawful to carry a weapon on oneâ€™s person.Â  \r\n    This section provides in full that it is unlawful to carry a weapon without \r\n    a permit.Â  Â§ 16-23-20 (12).Â  The State did not come forward with any evidence \r\n    that appellant was in unlawful possession of the gun and there is no evidence \r\n    regarding whether or not appellant had a permit. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [9] A \r\n    violation of Â§ 16-23-20 (carrying a concealed weapon) is a misdemeanor.Â  S.C. \r\n    Code Ann.

Bradley Hutto, of Orangeburg, for respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and remove respondent from office.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\n  FACTS\r\n  Respondent adjudicated fourteen traffic tickets issued to close family members and three traffic tickets issued to a friend.Â  With regard to these instances, respondent and ODC agree:Â  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n      Respondent served as the presiding judge on five speeding tickets which had been issued to his father.&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondent adjudicated his father not guilty on each of the tickets.&nbsp; Notations on three of the tickets indicate the officer or trooper had already reduced the violation to speeding less than ten miles over the speed limit at the time the tickets were issued.&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n      Respondent served as the presiding judge on a speeding ticket issued to his mother for speeding 64 in a 55 miles per hour zone.&nbsp; Notations by the officer on this ticket indicate the vehicle was traveling 68 miles per hour, that respondent&rsquo;s mother admitted she thought she was driving 65 miles per hour, and that the ticket was issued for the lesser offense of speeding less than ten miles per hour over the speed limit.&nbsp; Respondent adjudicated his mother not guilty.&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      3.\r\n      Respondent served as the presiding judge on a speeding ticket issued to his daughter for speeding 73 in a 55 miles per hour zone.&nbsp; Notations on the ticket indicate respondent&rsquo;s daughter admitted &ldquo;she was rushing to get home.&rdquo;&nbsp; Respondent adjudicated his daughter not guilty.&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      4.&nbsp;\r\n      Respondent served as the presiding judge on two speeding tickets issued to his sister-in-law.&nbsp; &ldquo;No Help&rdquo; is written in large letters on the bottom of the earlier ticket.&nbsp; Respondent adjudicated his sister-in-law not guilty on this ticket.&nbsp; \r\n      Notations on the &ldquo;Trial Officer&rsquo;s Copy&rdquo; of the other ticket indicate respondent&rsquo;s sister-in-law was traveling 70 in a 55 miles per hour zone and that she told the trooper she was inattentive to her speed.&nbsp; The trooper issued the ticket for the lesser offense of speeding 64 miles per hour in a 55 miles per hour zone.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Drivers Record Copy&rdquo; of this ticket is marked to indicate that respondent&rsquo;s sister-in-law did not appear for court, was found guilty, and a $50.00 fine was imposed.&nbsp; Approximately ten days later, respondent caused an Ishmell[1] order to be issued changing the verdict to not guilty for the following reason:&nbsp; &ldquo;Defendant had come before the judge prior to court time and had been granted a Not Guilty verdict.&nbsp; This verdict failed to reach proper persons handling court.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three days after the Department of Public Safety acted on the Ishmell order, respondent, or someone at his request, entered the notation &ldquo;NG 3-9-01 DJS&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Trial Officer&rsquo;s Copy&rdquo; of this ticket.&nbsp; Respondent also wrote a note on the back of this ticket stating that the &ldquo;verdict of the trial should read not guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      5.\r\n      Respondent served as the presiding judge on a speeding ticket issued to his sister for driving 64 in a 55 miles per hour zone.&nbsp; Notations on the ticket indicate she was actually driving 72 miles per hour, that she told the trooper she was not aware of her speed, and that the trooper reduced the charge to speeding less than ten miles per hour over the speed limit at the time the ticket was issued.&nbsp; Respondent adjudicated his sister not guilty.&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      6.&nbsp;\r\n      Respondent served as the presiding judge on two tickets issued to another sister.&nbsp; A March 10, 1996, ticket for a seat belt violation was adjudicated guilty.&nbsp; Court records indicate the fine was suspended.\r\n      On October 25, 1998, respondent&rsquo;s sister was issued a speeding ticket for driving 64 in a 55 miles per hour zone. The &ldquo;Trial Officer&rsquo;s Copy&rdquo; of this ticket bears notations indicating that the car was traveling 68 miles per hour and that the driver told the trooper she &ldquo;had [her] cruise on 64.&rdquo;&nbsp; Court was set for November 19, 1998.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Violator&rsquo;s Copy&rdquo; of this ticket bears a notation at the bottom &ldquo;Not Guilty per conversation with [the trooper] on 11-18-98&rdquo; (the day before court was to convene), and respondent&rsquo;s initials.&nbsp; Court records establish that a not guilty verdict was entered on this ticket.&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      7.\r\n      Respondent served as the presiding judge on two tickets issued to his brother.&nbsp; On April 4, 1998, respondent&rsquo;s brother was charged with speeding 78 in a 55 miles per hour zone.&nbsp; The ticket was adjudicated not guilty by respondent.\r\n      On June 24, 2000, respondent&rsquo;s brother was charged with speeding 64 in a 55 miles per hour zone.&nbsp; Notations on the ticket indicate the car was traveling 70 miles per hour, that the driver said he &ldquo;was not paying attention,&rdquo; and that the officer issued the ticket for the lesser offense of speeding less than ten miles per hour over the speed limit.&nbsp; Court records establish respondent adjudicated his brother guilty and imposed a sentence of one day in jail, but suspended the sentence.&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      8.&nbsp;\r\n      Respondent served as the presiding judge on three tickets issued to his friend Kenneth C. McMillian.&nbsp; Respondent found McMillian not guilty on one speeding ticket.&nbsp; Two tickets were issued to McMillian on December 6, 2002, one for speeding 83 in a 55 miles per hour zone and the other for no driver&rsquo;s license in possession.&nbsp; Respondent found McMillian guilty of the diver&rsquo;s license violation but suspended the fine.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Driver&rsquo;s Record Copy&rdquo; of the speeding ticket indicates McMillian appeared for court and was found guilty of the speeding violation.&nbsp; This disposition is certified as correct by a signature which appears to be respondent&rsquo;s on the &ldquo;Driver&rsquo;s Record Copy&rdquo; of the ticket.&nbsp; Later, respondent sought to have an Ishmell order issued concerning the ticket but the trooper refused on the ground that the proposed disposition would not be truthful.&nbsp; According to the trooper, McMillian appeared for court and pled guilty to the offense.&nbsp; Respondent, however, contacted the trooper&rsquo;s supervisor who agreed to issuance of an Ishmell order.&nbsp; The order subsequently was issued and McMillian&rsquo;s guilty verdict was changed to not guilty.&nbsp; A note handwritten by respondent appears on the back of the ticket stating that the &ldquo;verdict of trial should read not guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  Of the foregoing seventeen tickets issued to respondentâ€™s family and friends, respondent rendered a guilty verdict in five instances.Â  He subsequently changed two of the convictions to not guilty by an Ishmell order.Â  He issued suspended sentences on the remaining three convictions.Â  \r\n  An examination of the thirteen tickets obtained by ODC revealed that the two instances where a finding of guilt was recorded but later nullified by an Ishmell order, the â€œDriverâ€™s Records Copyâ€ of the tickets had been marked in the appropriate manner to show the disposition of the matter and the identity of the presiding judge.Â  In all other instances where respondent issued a not guilty verdict for family members, no entry was made in the appropriate area of the â€œTrial Officerâ€™s Copyâ€ of the ticket and no identification of the presiding judge was made on that copy.Â  Instead, the notation â€œNGâ€ or â€œNot Guiltyâ€ notation is accompanied by the typewritten initials â€œDJSâ€ or â€œdjs.â€Â  \r\n  Respondent failed to comply with the financial recordkeeping requirements set forth in the Chief Justiceâ€™s Order of November 9, 1999, establishing financial recordkeeping standards in magisterial courts.Â  In particular, the order requires that deposits be made â€œ(1) daily; or upon the accumulation of $250.00, whichever occurs least; (2) on each Friday; (3) and for the last working day of the month.â€Â  Information provided by respondentâ€™s office and an analysis of bank records by ODC establish that, on average, respondent made deposits only once a week from 1999 until the present.Â  \r\n  The November 9, 1999, order requires deposit slips to include starting and ending receipt numbers.Â  An analysis of deposit ticket exemplars and information received from magistrateâ€™s office personnel establish that, from 1999 until the date of the agreement, respondent failed to enter beginning and ending receipt numbers on the deposit tickets for funds deposited into respondentâ€™s bank accounts.Â  \r\n  The November 9, 1999, order provides that â€œall funds related to that docket and accompanying documentation must be remitted to the County Treasurerâ€ at the end of each monthly docket period.Â  An analysis of bank records and financial summary reports by ODC established that funds and supporting documentation for respondentâ€™s Civil and Criminal accounts were not remitted to the treasurer in accordance with the order.Â  \r\n  Specifically, during the eight month period from December 2002 through July 2003,[2] respondent failed to timely submit both monthly reports and funds on eight occasions.Â  In some instances, the submission of funds and reports was months late.Â  \r\n  An examination of financial records by ODC revealed that during the eight month review period, funds received by respondent were not remitted to the County Treasurer in accordance with the Courtâ€™s November 1999 order, leaving large balances to be carried forward each month in the Civil and Criminal accounts.Â  For the review period of December 2002 through July 2003, the carry forward balance in respondentâ€™s Criminal Account ranged from $128,000.00 to $199,000.00 and the carry forward balance in respondentâ€™s Civil Account ranged from $7,000.00 to $16,000.00.Â  \r\n  Respondent incurred an unexplained cash shortage of $445.00 in December 2001 and allowed this shortage to exist since that time without resolution.Â  Although respondent made a memorandum of the shortage and represents that he reported the shortage to the County Administrator, respondent failed to report the shortage to Court Administration and ODC as required by the November 9, 1999 order. \r\n  Respondent permitted his criminal account to incur monthly bank fees and charges which were drawn automatically by the bank from monies held in that account for safekeeping (i.e., bonds, fines).Â  For the eight month period of December 2002 through July 2003, the bank charged approximately $638.00 against the account for analysis fees. \r\n  In matters where respondent allowed defendants to make scheduled time payments, he withheld those payments from deposit until fullÂ  payment of the bond or fine had been received.Â  \r\n  LAW\r\n  Respondent admits that the conduct set forth above constitutes a violation of the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary); Canon 2(A) (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2B (judge shall not allow family or other relationships to influence his judicial conduct or judgment); Canon 3(B)(7) (judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending or impending proceeding); Canon 3(C) (judge shall diligently discharge his administrative responsibilities without bias or prejudice and maintain professional competence in judicial administration); and Canon 3(E) (judge shall disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned).[3]Â  Respondent agrees he violated the Chief Justiceâ€™s November 9, 1999, Order.Â  \r\n  Respondent also concedes that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the following provisions of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to persistently fail to perform judicial duties or persistently perform judicial duties in an incompetent or neglectful manner); and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to willfully violate a valid court order issued by a court of this state).Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and remove respondent from office.[4]Â  It is therefore ordered that respondent be removed from office as of the date of the filing of this opinion.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  REMOVED.\r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1] See Ishmell v.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n  Desa A. Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n  \r\n  PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into two Agreements for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the first agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction up to and including a two year definite suspension from the practice of law.Â  See Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the first agreement and impose a definite suspension of two years from the practice of law.Â  In the second agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE.Â  We accept the second agreement and disbar respondent.Â  The two sanctions shall run concurrently.Â  \r\n  FIRST AGREEMENT \r\n  The facts, as set forth in the first agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\n  FACTS\r\n  Matter I\r\n  Respondent graduated from law school in June 1999.Â  Before being admitted to practice law in any state, respondent obtained employment with Brock &amp; Scott, a Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based real estate firm.Â  He was assigned to the firmâ€™s law office in Rock Hill.Â  Respondent worked under the supervision of an attorney licensed to practice law in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  While employed as a non-lawyer at Brock &amp; Scott, respondent conducted real estate closings without an attorney being present.Â  Respondent signed his own name to the documents associated with the real estate closings.Â  After conducting the closings, it was respondentâ€™s practice to have other employees of the firm sign as witness and/or notary on the documents even though they were not present at the closings.Â  Respondent conducted some closings when there was no licensed South Carolina attorney on the premises.Â  Respondent routinely signed as witness and notary to documents relating to closings at which he was not present.Â  \r\n   In September 1999, Brock &amp; Scott merged with the firm of Forquer &amp; Green, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based real estate firm with an office in Columbia,Â  The two firms remained separate in North Carolina, but operated as Green, Brock, Forquer &amp; Scott in South Carolina.Â  Respondent continued to conduct real estate closings without an attorney present (and sometimes without an attorney on the premises) while employed by the new firm.Â  In connection with those real estate closings, respondent signed the name of his supervising attorney without indicating he was signing on her behalf.Â  He continued his practice of soliciting signatures and notarizations from staff members not present at the closings and signing his own name as witness and notary to documents executed outside his presence.Â  \r\n  In January 2000, the South Carolina attorney responsible for respondentâ€™s supervision left Green, Brock, Forquer &amp; Scott to work for a subsidiary company of Forquer &amp; Green in Charlotte.Â  Respondent continued to conduct real estate loan closings without the presence or supervision of a South Carolina attorney.Â  Respondent continued to sign his former supervising attorneyâ€™s name to real estate documents. \r\n  In April 2000, Green, Brock, Forquer &amp; Scott dissolved and respondent became employed with Forquer &amp; Green.Â  He continued to conduct real estate closings in the manner described above until his admission to the South Carolina Bar in November 2000.\r\n  Respondent estimates he conducted two or three closings per day from June 1999 until November 2000.Â  During the time period in which respondent conducted closings for the three law firms, it was not his practice to inform parties he was not an attorney.Â  While he did not affirmatively hold himself out as an attorney, respondent only disclosed the fact that he was not an attorney when a party made a specific inquiry.Â  Respondent acknowledges that it was likely that the parties to the closings assumed he was an attorney.Â  \r\n  During the time period in which respondent was conducting the closings for the three law firms, he made no meaningful inquiry about the propriety of a nonlawyer conducting real estate closings, although he represents he did have concerns in this regard.Â  Respondent did not question his employers, conduct research into the statutory or case law on the subject, consult with an attorney outside the firm, or seek guidance from the South Carolina Bar.\r\n  Matter II\r\n  On January 28, 2000, respondent traveled to the office of a mortgage company in Greenville to conduct a real estate closing for Mr. and Mrs. Doe.Â  Respondent was not licensed to practice law at the time.Â  There was no licensed attorney present at the closing or on the premises.Â  Many of the closing documents were signed by the Does in blank.Â  Respondent signed his supervising attorneyâ€™s name to the closing documents.Â  He returned the closing documents to the firm and solicited signatures of other staff members as witnesses and notary.Â  Respondentâ€™s involvement in this matter was discovered during an investigation of a grievance filed after the Does attempted to refinance the property and discovered that that mortgage and deed had never been filed.Â  \r\n  Matter III\r\n  On February 25, 2000, respondentâ€™s former supervisor at Green, Brock, Forquer &amp; Scott conducted a real estate closing for Mr. and Mrs. Smith as a favor to the firm because respondent was studying for the bar examination and unavailable.Â  Respondent was unaware of this arrangement.Â  \r\n  Upon his return to the firm after taking the examination, respondent found a stack of approximately ten to twenty closing files, including the Smithsâ€™ file, waiting for him to complete.Â  Respondent proceeded to sign his former supervisorâ€™s name to the closing documents in those files.Â  He was unaware that his former supervisor had actually conducted the Smithsâ€™ closing.Â  He assumed a paralegal had conducted the Smithsâ€™ closing.Â  Respondent signed his own name as witness and/or notary on the documents in the files, including the documents in the Smithsâ€™ file, although he was not present when the documents were executed.Â  Some of the documents in the Smithsâ€™ closing file were incomplete or contained blanks.Â  Respondent completed the documents or filled in the blanks.Â  Respondentâ€™s involvement in the matter was discovered during an investigation of a grievance filed after the Smiths attempted to refinance the property and discovered that the mortgage and deed had never been filed.Â  \r\n  Matter IV\r\n  On April 26, 2000, while working as a non-lawyer for Forquer &amp; Green, respondent was sent to a mortgage company in Greenville to conduct a closing for Mrs. Jones.Â  At this time, respondent was being supervised by a different South Carolina attorney who was not available to conduct the closing himself.Â  Although he was unaware of the circumstances at the time, respondent now reports that, in accordance with pleadings filed in ensuing litigation, they are as follows.Â  \r\n  Mrs. Jones contacted the mortgage company about refinancing her home because she faced foreclosure.Â  As a result of delays by the mortgage company, Mrs. Jonesâ€™ home was sold at a foreclosure sale.Â  Mr. Pressley, an employee of the mortgage company, purchased the home at the foreclosure sale.Â  Mr. Pressley also persuaded Mrs. Jones to endorse the check for her portion of the sales proceeds to himself.Â  For some reason, no deed was recorded by the special referee.Â  At Mr. Pressleyâ€™s request, respondentâ€™s firm prepared a deed from Mrs. Jones to Mr. Pressley.Â Â  \r\n  Upon his arrival at the mortgage company, respondent was handed the above-mentioned deed and was informed that Mrs. Jones had signed the deed, but had left before he arrived.Â  Respondent returned to the law office and signed his supervising attorneyâ€™s name as witness and his own name as notary.Â  Neither respondent nor his supervising attorney were present during the execution of the documents.Â  Respondent did not confirm with Mrs. Jones that she had in fact signed the deed.Â  \r\n  Ultimately, Mr. Pressley defaulted on the property and the home was sold at a second foreclosure.Â  In settlement of the lawsuit filed against respondent, his supervising attorney, and Forquer &amp; Green, the firm arranged for financing for Mrs. Jones, placed title to the property back in her name, and paid her a cash settlement.Â  \r\n  Matter V\r\n  Respondent continued his employment with Forquer &amp; Green following his admission to the South Carolina Bar in November 2000.Â  He became a partner in the firm in April 2001.Â  \r\n  After becoming a licensed attorney, respondent allowed non-lawyers under his supervision to conduct real estate closings outside his presence.Â  During that time, respondent also continued the practices of witnessing and notarizing documents that were executed outside his presence and soliciting witness and notary signatures from individuals in the firm not present during execution.Â  These practices continued until early in January 2002, when respondent received notice of grievances filed against him.Â  Respondent has now discontinued these practices and has instructed the members and staff of his firm to discontinue these practices.Â  \r\n  LAW\r\n  Respondent admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a) (1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a) (5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  In addition, respondent admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 5.3 (lawyer having direct supervisory authority over non-lawyer employee shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; lawyer is responsible for conduct of non-lawyer employee if the conduct would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer and lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not assist non-lawyer in performance of activity which constitutes unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â \r\n  We note that a significant portion of respondentâ€™s misconduct, including conducting real estate closings, signing documents on behalf of others without so indicating, and requesting others sign as witness or notary on documents not signed in their presence, occurred before respondent was licensed to practice law in this state.Â  We take this opportunity to address the Courtâ€™s authority to discipline an attorney for conduct which occurred prior to, but was not discovered until after, his or her admission to the practice of law. [1]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  The South Carolina Constitution specifies that this Court has jurisdiction â€œover the admission to practice law and the discipline of persons admitted.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 4.Â  The â€œcentral purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from unscrupulous and indifferent lawyers.â€Â  Matter of Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998); Matter of Brooks, 324 S.C. 105, 477 S.E.2d 98 (1996) (primary purpose of lawyer discipline is to maintain integrity of courts and protect the public).Â  In order to maintain the publicâ€™s trust, the Court possesses the authority to discipline attorneys for misconduct related to the legal profession and for misconduct which occurs outside the legal profession.2Â  For the purpose of protecting the publicâ€™s trust in the legal system it is likewise the Courtâ€™s duty to discipline an attorney for misconduct which precedes his or her admission to the practice of law.Â  See Stratmore v. State Bar of California, 538 P.2d 229 (Cal. 1975); Kentucky Bar Assoc. v. Signer, 533 S.W.2d 534 (Ky. 1976); Matter of Wong, 710 N.YS.2d 57 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000); see also Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Zdrok, 645 A.2d 830 (Pa. 1994) (attorney disciplined for conduct which occurred before becoming member of bar did not violate constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws). 3\r\n  Practically speaking, had the Court known of respondentâ€™s misconduct prior to his admission, the information could have affected his admission to the Bar.Â  Respondentâ€™s ability to keep relevant information from the Court until after his admission should not leave the Court without any means to address the situation.Â Â Â Â  \r\n  By holding the Court has the authority to discipline an attorney for misconduct which occurred prior to admission, we do notÂ  suggest attorneys will be or should be disciplined for any and all pre-admission misconduct.Â  Instead, the Court will consider the nature and severity of the misconduct along with its date in relation to the attorneyâ€™s admission. \r\n  Here, respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred after his graduation from law school, while he was preparing to sit for and awaiting the results of the bar examination, and while he was working for a law firm.Â  Respondent candidly admits he allowed firm clients to assume he was a licensed attorney.Â  This Court cannot ignore the fact that, within months prior to his admission to the South Carolina Bar, respondent actively participated in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  The Court concludes respondent is subject to the disciplinary authority of this Court for this misconduct.Â Â Â  Â Â  \r\n  We accept the first agreement and impose a definite suspension of two years from the practice of law.Â  \r\n  SECOND AGREEMENT\r\n  The facts, as set forth in the second agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\n  FACTS\r\n  Matter I\r\n  From June 2001 through May 2002 when he worked for the Rock Hill subsidiary of Forquer, Lattimore &amp; Calloway (f/k/a Forquer &amp; Green and f/k/a Green, Brock, Forquer &amp; Scott), respondent conducted real estate closings on behalf of two real estate investment companies, Kenbill Properties (Kenbill) and Keystone Properties (Keystone).Â  Respondent became involved with these real estate investment companies less than a year after his admission to the Bar.Â  Although he was made a partner in the firm, he was provided no training or supervision by Mr. Green or Mr. Forquer, the senior partners in the firm, neither of whom was licensed in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  Kenbill Properties (Kenbill) and Keystone Properties (Keystone) were in the business of locating properties and finding borrowers/investors to purchase the properties.Â  The borrowers/investors were told they needed no down payment and would actually be paid money to purchase homes.Â  The real estate investment companies promised to locate renters and manage the properties.Â  They agreed to collect rent, pay the mortgage and upkeep, retain a fee, and then pay the balance to the borrowers/investors.Â  \r\n  The seller (usually the builder) established a sales price for the property.Â  The real estate investment companies, with the assistance of a mortgage broker or loan officer, then prepared a sales contract, loan application, and other documents containing an inflated sales price (approximately $15,000 to $100,00 above the actual sales price), down payment amount, and false information about the borrower/investor.Â  The documents were presented to and approved by a lender.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, respondent would complete a title search, a title commitment, and a HUD-1 settlement statement.Â  The HUD-1 prepared by respondent would reflect the inflated sales price, a down payment from the borrower/investor, and a cash payment to seller.Â  At closing, the HUD-1 would be signed by the borrower/investor, the seller, and respondent.Â  The parties would also sign a certification that the information on the HUD-1 was a true and accurate representation of the receipts and disbursements in the transaction.Â  Instead of disbursing the cash to seller as stated in the HUD-1, respondent would pay a portion to the real estate investment company as an assignment or consultingÂ  fee and pay the balance to the seller.Â  The borrower/investor would then be paid a fee outside the closing by the seller or the real estate investment company.Â  \r\n  In some cases, the borrower/investor would not bring any cash to the closing, contrary to the representation made on the HUD-1.Â  The only funds received by respondent were the loan proceeds which would be disbursed according to the assignment agreement between the real estate investment company and the seller, rather than in accordance with the HUD-1.\r\n   In cases where the lender required proof of certified funds from the borrower, the real estate investment company would purchase a cashierâ€™s check to bring to the closing (implying the check was provided by the borrower).Â  In those cases, respondent would deposit the cashierâ€™s check and would add that amount back to the assignment fee check paid to the real estate investment company.Â  \r\n  While respondent did not participate in the preparation of the fraudulent contracts or loan applications, he was responsible for preparing the fraudulent HUD-1 forms.Â  He did so with knowledge that no cash would be received from the borrower/investor and that loan proceeds would not be disbursed as stated.Â  With each loan package, respondent received a set of closing instructions.Â  Those instructions specifically required respondent to verify that the HUD-1 settlement statement was a true and accurate accounting of the transaction.Â  In many cases, respondent was instructed not to proceed with the transaction if he became aware of any payments to or contributions from any third parties not identified on the HUD-1. \r\n  Many of the borrowers/investors received lower interest rates because it was represented to the lenders that they intended to occupy the properties as primary residences.Â  This representation was made on the loan applications and on affidavits and certifications contained in the loan packages required by the lender.Â  These representations were false.Â  Additionally, the mortgage securing the lenderâ€™s interest in the property contained an occupancy clause, violation of which would render the borrower in default.Â  While respondent did not prepare the loan applications, owner occupancy affidavits, or mortgages, he did present them to the borrowers for signature at the closings.Â  While respondent did not have specific knowledge that the borrowers did not intend to occupy the properties, he was aware of the nature of Kenbillâ€™s and Keystoneâ€™s businesses and he had sufficient facts that should have caused him to question the legitimacy of the transactions.Â  \r\n  Matter II\r\n  On at least eight occasions, respondent conducted concurrent real estate transactions on the same property for Kenbill and others.Â  These transactions are sometimes referred to as either a property â€œflipâ€ or loan â€œflip.â€Â  \r\n  In an illegal property flip, the seller enters into a sales contract with Buyer A.Â  Prior to the commencement of that sale, Buyer A enters into a contract to sell the same property at a higher price to Buyer B.Â  Buyer B uses this contract to obtain financing.Â  Buyer A obtains no financing.Â  The conveyances are then made concurrently, with Buyer A using the loan proceeds obtained by Buyer B to purchase the property from Seller.Â  The flip transaction is illegal when the information to the lender, including the information stated on the HUD-1 settlement statement, fails to disclose that the property is being conveyed in two transactions.Â  Often documents have to be pre-dated or post-dated to mislead the lender.Â  Title commitments, sellerâ€™s affidavits or confirmations, and closing attorney certifications must contain false information.Â  Often, neither Seller nor Buyer B is aware of the otherâ€™s involvement.Â  In those cases, Buyer A retains the excess loan proceeds.Â  Buyer B then has a loan on the property that far exceeds the property value.Â  In other cases, Buyer B is in collusion with Buyer A and they share the excess loan proceeds and leave the lender with property insufficient to cover its loan. \r\n  The cooperation of the closing agent is necessary for an illegal property flip to succeed.Â  First, the title search required by the lender will reveal that the Seller owns the property rather than Buyer A (the party the lender believes is the seller).Â  Second, the closing agent must actually close the Buyer A to Buyer B transaction first in order to fund the Seller to Buyer A transaction.Â  However, the deed from Seller to Buyer A must be recorded prior to the deed from Buyer A to Buyer B.Â  Finally, the lenderâ€™s closing instructions often require that the closing agent verify that the property has not been conveyed within a certain time period prior to the closing and/or that there is no simultaneous conveyance of the property.Â  \r\n  In the eight flip sales closed by respondent, the HUD-1 settlement statements and other closing documents did not disclose to the lenders that the properties were being transferred in two conveyances rather than one.Â  Further, the HUD-1 settlement statements did not reveal that the loan proceeds were being used to fund the first conveyance.Â  Respondent admits he failed to comply with the lendersâ€™ closing instructions in these transactions, but certified that he had complied with the instructions.Â  Respondent represents he lacked the experience or training sufficient to recognize the transactions as fraudulent.Â  He relied on the experience and expertise of his partners, the brokers, agents, and investment companies.Â  \r\n  Matter III\r\n  Mr. Heckle was the proprietor of Keystone.Â  He was also affiliated with Kenbill.Â  Mr. Heckle broke his ties with that company when its principals came under federal investigation for mortgage fraud.Â  Respondent had ceased closing loans for Kenbill prior to that time.Â  \r\n  Respondent subsequently entered into a joint venture with Mr. Heckle.Â  Respondent intended to engage in real estate investment without defrauding lenders.Â  \r\n  Respondentâ€™s agreement with Mr. Heckle provided that respondent would solicit investors to purchase homes built by Mr. Smith.Â  The borrower/investor would advance money that would be listed on the HUD-1 as cash from buyer (i.e., down payment).Â  Respondent would rebate or kick back a portion of the sales proceeds to Mr. Heckle.Â  Mr. Heckle was to retain one-third of the rebate as his fee, pay one-third of the rebate to respondent as his non-legal fee, and place the remaining one-third into a Keystone account.Â  The Keystone account was to be used to manage the properties and pay the mortgage payments until rent was received.Â  Once rent was received, the balance from the transaction in the Keystone account would be paid to borrowers/investors.Â  The rent payments would be applied to the loan payment and management expenses and any profit would go to the borrowers/investors.Â  Respondent believed this arrangement would be legal because the trust account disbursements would correspond with the HUD-1.Â  \r\n  Respondent recruited members of his family and friends to make these real estate investments.Â  In these transactions, Mr. Smith determined the minimum sales price he would accept for each property.Â  Based on an inflated sales price and representation to the lender that the borrower would make a down payment, loans were obtained for more than Mr. Smithâ€™s sales price.Â  Mr. Heckle and the borrower/investors would provide the down payment.Â  Respondent or someone from his firm conducted the closings.Â  \r\n  At the closings, the firm received the loan proceeds plus the â€œdown payments.â€Â  Trust account checks were then issued according to the HUD-1.Â  Mr. Smith received a check in the amount listed on the HUD-1 as payable to the seller.Â  Mr. Smith would then pay rebates (or kickbacks) to Keystone, to Mr. Heckle, and to the borrowers/investors.Â  \r\n  At the time, respondent believed that, because the amount shown on the HUD-1 was the amount actually paid to the seller from the trust account, that the transactions were legal.Â  Respondent now admits that, because he was aware that the seller made subsequent distributions to Keystone, Mr. Heckle, and the borrowers/investors, that those distributions should have been revealed to the lender.Â  He further admits that he was aware that the sales prices listed on the HUD-1 statements were not the actual prices paid to the seller.Â  \r\n  At the closing of several of these transactions, respondent began to have some concerns about Mr. Heckle when a $15,000 check to a borrower/investor from the Keystone account was returned for insufficient funds and when one of respondentâ€™s investors reported that a mortgage payment had not been made.Â  Mr. Heckle explained the lack of funds by stating his wife, who had access to the Keystone account, had taken the funds.Â  \r\n  After the check was returned for insufficient funds, respondent assumed control over the management of the funds using his own account.Â  He required Mr. Heckle to make up the shortfalls in cash derived from subsequent transactions.Â  \r\n  In connection with these transactions, owner occupancy affidavits that stated the borrowers/investors intended to occupy the properties as primary residences were signed, notarized, and submitted to the lenders.Â  Respondent was aware that most of the borrowers/investors did not intend to live in the homes.Â  Respondent incorrectly advised the borrowers/investors that they were only required to spend one night in their properties to render the owner occupancy affidavits truthful.Â  Respondent based this advice on incorrect information he received from a lender not associated with any of the transactions.\r\n  Respondent ultimately discovered that Mr. Heckle was not managing or maintaining the properties or securing renters.Â  Respondent then dissolved the joint venture with Mr. Heckle and took over management of the properties.Â  He used his own funds to cover investorsâ€™ losses.Â  When he discovered that his understanding of the requirements for owner occupancy was incorrect, he assisted the borrowers/investors in notifying the lenders and submitting corrected affidavits.Â  \r\n  Respondentâ€™s interest in these investments created a conflict of interest for respondent and his firm.Â  Respondent failed to advise the lenders or the borrowers/investors of that conflict of interest, although the investors he recruited were made aware of his personal involvement with Keystone.Â  Respondent failed to obtained informed consent to waivers of this conflict of interest in accordance with the requirements of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n  Respondent never received any funds from the proceeds of the loans as had been promised by Mr. Heckle.Â  He did not personally profit from any of the transactions other than the legal fees generated which were paid to the firm.Â  Respondent has paid significant sums to correct his errors.\r\n  Respondent made a self-report to the ODC.Â  ODC agrees respondent has fully cooperated in this investigation.Â  \r\n  LAW\r\n  Respondent admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, particularly Rule 7(a)(1) (it is ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(5) (it is ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring legal profession into disrepute or to engage in conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (it is ground for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).Â  In addition, respondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.8 (lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire a pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless transactions and terms are reasonable to the client and fully disclosed and submitted to client in writing and client consents in writing); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  \r\n  We accept the second agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law.Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  We accept the two Agreements for Discipline by Consent.Â  We impose a definite suspension of two years and disbar respondent from the practice of law.Â  The sanctions shall run concurrently.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n  DEFINITELY SUSPENDED AND DISBARRED.\r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1] It is a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct for an applicant for admission to the bar to knowingly make a false statement of material fact in connection with the application process.Â  Rule 8.1 of Rule 407, SCACR.Â  In addition, the Rules Pertaining to the Admission to Practice Law advise the Court may vacate the admission or otherwise discipline an attorney if it is determined he provided false or misleading information in his application.Â  Rule 402(h), SCACR.Â  These rules are not directly applicable to the circumstances presented here as respondentâ€™s misconduct was not specifically addressed in the admissions process.Â  However, they suggest the Court can sanction an attorney for misconduct which occurs prior to admission.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [2] See Preamble to Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR (lawyerâ€™s conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyerâ€™s business and personal affairs).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [3] In Matter of Edwards , 327 S.C. 148,

White, 353 S.C. 566, 578 S.E.2d 728 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We affirm \r\n  as modified.\r\nFACTUAL \r\n  BACKGROUNDÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFollowing a jury trial, Respondent/Petitioner Nickie White (White) was convicted \r\n  of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) and kidnapping.Â  White was sentenced \r\n  to consecutive prison terms of thirty years for the criminal sexual conduct \r\n  and ten years for kidnapping.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed Whiteâ€™s kidnapping \r\n  conviction, but reversed Whiteâ€™s first-degree CSC conviction, holding the circuit \r\n  court erred in refusing to charge assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature (ABHAN) as a lesser-included offense of CSC.Â  The Court of Appeals also \r\n  concluded the trial court did not err in refusing to charge simple assault as \r\n  a lesser included offense of CSC and that any error in admitting the testimony \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s expert on post-traumatic stress disorder and sexual abuse was \r\n  harmless.Â  Id. at 575-76, 578 S.E.2d at 733.\r\nThe events giving rise to Whiteâ€™s conviction occurred in the early \r\n  morning hours of August 1, 1998, after White and the victim left a club in Columbia \r\n  where the victim was employed.Â  On several previous occasions, the victim and \r\n  White conversed while the victim worked.Â  On the night of July 31, 1998, White \r\n  was again a customer in the club.Â  White and the victim talked and danced.Â  \r\n  When the victim needed to go for change during her shift, she asked White to \r\n  accompany her.Â  While the two were out, they took photographs together, kissed, \r\n  and held hands.Â  \r\nWhite and the victim returned to the club and the victim accepted \r\n  Whiteâ€™s invitation to breakfast.Â Â  Soon thereafter, the victim testified she \r\n  became tired and frustrated because she had not made much money that night.Â  \r\n  She therefore declined Whiteâ€™s breakfast invitation.Â  Despite her fatigue and \r\n  frustration, the victim agreed to drive White to his grandmotherâ€™s house where \r\n  he resided because he had no ride home.Â  When they arrived, White went inside \r\n  to check on his grandmother and then returned to the car where the victim was \r\n  waiting.Â  At this point, White and the victim offered very different accounts \r\n  of the events that followed.\r\nThe victim testified White asked her to take him to the store to buy a soda. \r\n  The victim further testified that White pulled a knife on her, held it to her \r\n  throat, and threatened to kill her if she did not do as he said.Â  White then \r\n  directed the victim to Earlewood Park where he ordered her to park the car.Â  \r\n  When the victim attempted to escape, White ran her down and dragged her into \r\n  the woods.Â  White punched the victim, raped her, and took one of her rings.Â  \r\n  White began choking the victim, and a struggle ensued for the knife. The victim \r\n  testified she retrieved the knife and began swinging it back and forth in Whiteâ€™s \r\n  direction, injuring White.Â  White then grabbed the victim and began choking \r\n  her again.Â  The victim threw the knife into the woods and grabbed Whiteâ€™s genitals.Â  \r\n  The two continued to struggle and White suddenly walked off.Â  Shortly after \r\n  the attack, the victim encountered two men in the park who took her to the hospital.\r\nWhiteâ€™s account differed.Â  According to White, after going to the \r\n  store for a soda, the victim asked him to go to Earlewood Park to watch the \r\n  sunrise.Â  White testified he brought along a butcher knife to protect the two \r\n  because the area has a history of drug-related violence.Â  Once White and the \r\n  victim arrived at the park, White stated the victim began â€œcoming onâ€ to him.Â  \r\n  The victim began kissing him and the two engaged in what White contended was \r\n  consensual sex.Â  White testified he ended the sexual encounter because he began \r\n  thinking of his girlfriend.Â  According to White, the victim became so angry \r\n  that she grabbed Whiteâ€™s knife and stabbed him.Â  In self-defense, he hit her \r\n  in the eye.Â  \r\nWhite testified he initially lied to law enforcement officers when \r\n  he said he had been robbed by five males dressed in camouflage because he was \r\n  scared and in shock.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in concluding White was entitled to an ABHAN charge?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge the jury on simple assault and battery\r\n          as a lesser-included offense of first-degree CSC?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s admission of expert testimony on post-traumatic stress disorder and sexual \r\n  abuse?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.Â   \r\n\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding White \r\n  was entitled to a charge on ABHAN as a lesser included offense of first-degree \r\n  CSC.Â  We disagree.\r\nABHAN is a lesser included offense of first degree CSC.Â  \r\n  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 581, 564 S.E.2d 103, 106 (2002).Â  The \r\n  law to be charged is determined by the evidence presented at trial.Â  State \r\n  v. Todd, 290 S.C. 212, 349 S.E.2d 339 (1986).Â  A trial judge must charge \r\n  a lesser included offense if there is any evidence from which the jury could \r\n  infer the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense.Â  Brightman \r\n  v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 350-351, 520 S.E.2d 614, 615 (1999).Â  Conversely, \r\n  a trial judge does not err by refusing to charge a lesser included offense where \r\n  there is no evidence tending to show the defendant was guilty only of the lesser \r\n  offense. State v. Funchess, 267 S.C. 427, 429, 229 S.E.2d 331, 332 (1976).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe Court of Appeals did not err in concluding the trial judge should have \r\n  charged the jury on ABHAN and reversing Whiteâ€™s CSC conviction.Â  State v. \r\n  Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993) (a trial court commits \r\n  reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised by \r\n  the evidence).Â  Both the victimâ€™s and Whiteâ€™s testimony support a charge of \r\n  ABHAN.Â  ABHAN is â€œan unlawful act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances \r\n  of aggravation.â€Â  Primus, 349 S.C. at 580, 564 S.E.2d at 105. â€œâ€˜Circumstances \r\n  of aggravationâ€™ is an element of ABHAN.â€Â  Id. â€œCircumstances of aggravation \r\n  include the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a felony, infliction \r\n  of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions \r\n  of the parties, a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction of shame and \r\n  disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, and resistance \r\n  to lawful authority.â€Â  Id. at 580-81, 564 S.E.2d at 105-106.Â Â  \r\nThe victimâ€™s testimony that prior to the commission of the CSC, White \r\n  dragged her into the woods while threatening her with the knife and punched \r\n  her in the eye supports a charge of ABHAN because it was contemporaneous with \r\n  the CSC.Â  Whiteâ€™s testimony that he and the victim engaged in consensual sex, \r\n  the victim stabbed him, and he hit the victim in the eye, is evidence from which \r\n  the jury could infer White committed ABHAN rather than CSC.Â  Cf. State \r\n  v. Fields, 356 S.C. 517, 589 S.E.2d 792 (Ct. App. 2003) (concluding the \r\n  defendant, in prosecution for CSC, was not entitled to jury instruction on ABHAN \r\n  where the defendant did not testify and there was no evidence presented at trial \r\n  to support the defenseâ€™s assertion that the sex was consensual).Â  In other words, \r\n  there was evidence from which the jury could have concluded the sex was consensual \r\n  and that the battery occurred after the sexual encounter.Â  Therefore, the Court \r\n  of Appeals did not err in holding White was entitled to an ABHAN charge and \r\n  reversing Whiteâ€™s first degree CSC charge.\r\nII.\r\nWhite argues \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge \r\n  simple assault and battery as a lesser included offense of first-degree criminal \r\n  sexual conduct.Â  We disagree, although we modify the Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis.\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded this case is outside the \r\n  realm of simple assault and battery because the parties are of opposite sexes.Â  \r\n  An example of a circumstance of aggravation includes difference in gender. Primus, \r\n  349 S.C. at 580, 564 S.E.2d at 105.Â Â  Simple assault and battery is an unlawful \r\n  act of violent injury to another, unaccompanied by any circumstances of aggravation.Â  \r\n  State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 21, 518 S.E.2d 278, 285 (Ct. App. 1999) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals determined that a simple \r\n  assault and battery charge was not proper because a circumstance of aggravation \r\n  existed in this factual scenario.\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ holding appears to establish a bright \r\n  line rule that in all cases of assault and battery involving persons of different \r\n  genders, any assault must be one of a high and aggravated nature.Â  A difference \r\n  in gender, like any other aggravating circumstance, is a factor for the court \r\n  to consider in determining if the evidence warrants a jury charge on simple \r\n  assault.Â  A simple assault and battery may occur between a man and a woman, \r\n  depending on the degree of violence and the circumstances attending the attack. \r\n   [1] Â  See e.g., State \r\n  v. Young, 243 S.C. 187, 133 S.E.2d 210 (1963) (concluding that resistance \r\n  to lawful arrest, an aggravating factor, may warrant a charge on simple assault \r\n  and battery depending on the facts of the case).Â  Every assault and battery, \r\n  however slight, upon a member of the opposite sex does not become assault and \r\n  battery of a high and aggravated nature because of the very fact the attack \r\n  was upon one of the opposite sex. Â A difference in gender is a factor to be \r\n  considered, together with the other circumstances of the attack, in determining \r\n  the gravity of the assault and battery upon the person.\r\nAlthough, a \r\n  difference in gender alone is not dispositive on whether the jury should be \r\n  charged with simple assault and battery, we believe under the facts of this \r\n  case, the trial judge properly denied Whiteâ€™s request for a simple assault and \r\n  battery charge.\r\nIII.\r\nWhite contends \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in concluding the trial court properly allowed Cole \r\n  Badger, a psychotherapist who counseled the victim and qualified as an expert \r\n  in post-traumatic stress disorder and assessment and treatment of sexual abuse, \r\n  to testify.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, White argues Badgerâ€™s testimony in this case was \r\n  outside the scope of the exception for rape trauma evidence carved out by State \r\n  .v Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993).Â  In Schumpert, \r\n  we held that both expert testimony and behavioral evidence are admissible as \r\n  rape trauma evidence to prove a sexual offense occurred where the probative \r\n  value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.Â  Id. at 506, \r\n  435 S.E.2d at 862.Â  White argues that Schumpert only applies in cases \r\n  in which there is a child victim.Â  Because the victim in the present case was \r\n  an adult when the incident occurred, Schumpert is inapplicable.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nExpert testimony on rape trauma may be more crucial in situations \r\n  where children are victims.Â  The inexperience and impressionability of children \r\n  often render them unable to effectively articulate the events giving rise to \r\n  criminal sexual behavior.Â  Nevertheless, the importance of rape trauma testimony \r\n  in the case of a child victim does not negate the relevance of rape trauma evidence \r\n  where the victim is an adult.Â  The purpose of rape trauma evidence is to prove \r\n  the elements of criminal sexual conduct since such evidence may make it more \r\n  or less probable the offense occurred.Â  State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. \r\n  377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991).Â  This is true whether the victim is an adult or \r\n  child.Â  See State v. Marks, 231 Kan. 645, 647 P.2d 1292 (1982) \r\n  (concluding in prosecution for rape in which defendant raised defense of consent, \r\n  psychiatristâ€™s testimony that twenty-one year old victim had been suffering \r\n  from rape trauma was relevant).Â  \r\nSecond, White argues the prejudicial effect of the expert \r\n  testimony outweighed its probative value.Â  Specifically, White argues Badger \r\n  should not have been allowed to testify the victimâ€™s symptoms were consistent \r\n  with those of a recent trauma sufferer.Â  We disagree.Â  Badgerâ€™s testimony is \r\n  consistent with the probative purpose of admitting rape trauma evidence, i.e., \r\n  to refute the defendantâ€™s contention that the sex was consensual and to prove \r\n  that a sexual offense occurred.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we agree with the Court of Appeals that Badgerâ€™s \r\n  testimony was cumulative.Â  Even assuming the trial judge erred in admitting \r\n  the testimony, reversal is not warranted when evidence erroneously admitted \r\n  is merely cumulative.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE.Â  At trial Badger testified \r\n  that the victimâ€™s symptoms were consistent with someone who had suffered trauma \r\n  and had been raped. [2] Â  A nurse who examined the victim testified \r\n  that the victim was â€œupset and appeared frightened, disheveled; she was crying, \r\n  visible shaken.â€ Additionally, the nurse testified the victimâ€™s physical and \r\n  mental state was consistent with what the nurse was told happened to the victim.Â  \r\n  Dr. Jenkins testified that the victim was â€œquite tearful; she was very agitatedâ€ \r\n  and that the victim had suffered trauma. \r\nFinally, White argues that Badger improperly testified she \r\n  believed the victim.Â  We conclude White opened the door to this testimony by \r\n  cross-examining Badger as to whether she had cases in which she did not believe \r\n  the alleged victim.Â  State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 582 S.E.2d 426 (2003) \r\n  (one who opens the door to evidence cannot complain of its admission).Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm as modified the Court \r\n  of Appealsâ€™ decision.\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1] Â  See State v.

[2] Â  In 1999, the General Assembly enacted the \r\n  South Carolina Telecommunications Act of 1999 (Act), codified at S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 58-9-2200, et. seq. (Supp. 2003).Â  Pursuant to this Act, municipalities can \r\n  impose a business license tax on telecommunications companies doing business \r\n  within a municipality.Â Â  Id.Â  The amount of the tax is based upon the \r\n  gross income from retail telecommunications services that either originate or \r\n  terminate within the municipality and is charged to a service address located \r\n  within the municipality.Â  Id.Â Â  Between 1999 and 2003, the business tax \r\n  was not to exceed 3/10 of one percent of the gross income for the preceding \r\n  year.Â Â  Id.Â  The tax is due January 1st and considered delinquent \r\n  if not paid by January 31st.Â  Most of the stateâ€™s municipalities \r\n  have authorized the MASC to collect the taxes from the telecommunications businesses \r\n  and the MASC is to receive 4% of what it collects.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn March 2, 2000, defendant \r\n  AT&amp;T Communications of Southern States, Inc., (AT&amp;T) paid its telecommunications \r\n  business taxes for the year 1999 in the amount of $737,686.65.Â  On June 18, \r\n  2001, AT&amp;T reported additional gross income for the tax year 1999 and paid \r\n  $1,025,937.65 in additional business license taxes. AT&amp;T contends MASC refused \r\n  to accept this payment for nearly six (6) months. Â In any event, AT&amp;T eventually \r\n  paid the additional taxes and now the MASC seeks a penalty of $872,047.00.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, on February 28, \r\n  2002, AT&amp;T paid its year 2001 taxes which were due on January 31, 2002.Â  \r\n  The MASC is seeking a late payment penalty on the 2001 taxes in the amount of \r\n  $73,560.70 and requesting a statutory audit because the MASC contends that AT&amp;T \r\n  actually owes more for 2001.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThis certified question revolves around the powers \r\n  granted to municipalities.Â  Section 5-7-30 lists the powers conferred upon municipalities.Â  \r\n  Specifically, this section provides that a municipality:Â Â  \r\n\r\nmay enact regulations, resolutions, \r\n  and ordinances, not inconsistent with the Constitution and general law of this \r\n  State, including . . . levy a business license tax on gross income . . . . The \r\n  municipal governing body may fix fines and penalties for the violation of municipal \r\n  ordinances and regulations not exceeding five hundred dollars or imprisonment \r\n  not exceeding thirty days, or both.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (2004).Â  \r\n  Additionally, â€œresponsibilities granted local government subdivisions by [the] \r\n  Constitution and by law shall include those fairly implied and not prohibited \r\n  by [the] Constitution.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 17.Â  Furthermore, Â§ 5-7-10 \r\n  states that &quot;[t]he powers of a municipality shall be liberally construed \r\n  in favor of the municipality and the specific mention of particular powers shall \r\n  not be construed as limiting in any manner the general powers of such municipalities.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-10 (2004).\r\n\r\nDetermining if a local ordinance is valid is essentially a \r\n  two-step process. The first step is to ascertain whether the county or municipality \r\n  that enacted the ordinance had the power to do so.Â  If no such power existed, \r\n  the ordinance is invalid and the inquiry ends. However, if the local government \r\n  had the power to enact the ordinance, the next step is to ascertain whether \r\n  the ordinance is inconsistent with the Constitution or general law of this State. \r\n  . . . \r\n\r\nHospitality Assâ€™n v. County of Charleston, \r\n  320 S.C. 219, 224, 464 S.E.2d 113, 116-7 (1995).\r\nClearly, the municipalities have the power to enact \r\n  these ordinances. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-2200 et. seq.Â  The issue \r\n  is whether these ordinances are inconsistent with state law.Â  â€œ[I]n order for \r\n  there to be a conflict between a state statute and a municipal ordinance â€˜both \r\n  must contain either express or implied conditions which are inconsistent or \r\n  irreconcilable with each other. . . . If either is silent where the other speaks, \r\n  there can be no conflict between them.Â  Where no conflict exists, both laws \r\n  stand.â€™â€Â Â  The Town of Hilton Head v. Fine Liquors, 302 S.C. 550, 553, \r\n  397 S.E.2d 662, 664 (1990)(quoting McAbee v. Southern Ry. Co., \r\n  166 S.C. 166, 169-70, 164 S.E. 444, 445 (1932)).\r\nFurthermore, the words of the \r\n  statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to \r\n  subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.Â  Hitachi \r\n  Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992). \r\n  The language must also be read in a sense which â€œharmonizes with its subject \r\n  matter and accords with its general purpose.â€ Â Id. (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nSection 5-7-30 specifically \r\n  provides for a $500 maximum fine and/or imprisonment for thirty (30) days for \r\n  a violation of a municipalityâ€™s ordinance.Â  The fine is not explicitly designated \r\n  as either civil or criminal. MASC contends the reference is to only a criminal \r\n  penalty and that the power to impose a civil penalty is implied.Â  AT&amp;T contends \r\n  the $500 limit applies to both civil and criminal penalties.Â  \r\nGiving the words of Â§ 5-7-30 \r\n  their ordinary meaning and harmonizing the language with its subject matter, \r\n  we conclude the term â€œfineâ€ in 5-7-30 applies only to criminal fines.Â  By including \r\n  the reference to a maximum term of imprisonment, the General Assembly obviously \r\n  was contemplating a maximum criminal fine.Â  See 36A C.J.S. Fines Â§ 9 \r\n  (2004)(â€œA statute providing that on a conviction the party guilty of violating \r\n  it shall be fined or imprisoned or both ordinarily contemplates a criminal proceeding \r\n  only.â€)Â  Furthermore, merely because a criminal remedy has been specifically \r\n  authorized does not mean the General Assembly meant this to be the exclusive \r\n  manner by which municipalities could enforce ordinances.Â  As noted above, the \r\n  powers of a municipality are to be liberally construed and include those fairly \r\n  implied and not prohibited by the Constitution.Â  S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 17; \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-10. The power of the municipalities to impose a civil fine \r\n  for a violation of its ordinances is fairly implied and not prohibited.Â  Therefore, \r\n  in conclusion, we find these ordinances are not inconsistent with state law.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we answer the certified question affirmatively: South Carolina \r\n  law allows municipalities to impose by ordinance a 5% per month penalty for \r\n  the late payment of business license taxes.Â  \r\nWe also note that although the \r\n  issues of reasonableness and constitutionality of such a fine are apparently \r\n  at issue in this case, we are limited to answering only the certified question \r\n  before us.Â  Therefore, we specifically express no view as to the reasonableness \r\n  or constitutionality of the fine imposed.Â  \r\nQUESTION ANSWERED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, \r\n  WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The facts are based on the factual findings in \r\n    the district court's certification order.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Susan M. Johnston, Deputy \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\r\nR. Davis Howser, of Howser Newman &amp; Besley, LLC, and Elizabeth Van Doren \r\n  Gray, of Sowell Gray Stepp &amp; Laffitte, LLC, both of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\n  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a sixty (60) \r\n  day suspension from the practice of law.Â  See Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR.Â  We accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice \r\n  of law in this state for a sixty (60) day period.Â  The facts, as set forth in \r\n  the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent engaged in a business \r\n  relationship with South Carolina Real Estate Services, LLC, (RES), a company \r\n  managed by Cathy Pittman, daughter of Anna Knox (Knox), and Attorney Support, \r\n  Inc., (ASI), a company owned and managed by Knox.Â  These two companies provided \r\n  services to assist attorneys in the closing of real estate transactions.Â  \r\nNeither Knox nor Pittman were employees \r\n  of respondent or his law firm during the period relevant to the Agreement.Â  \r\n  Neither Knox nor Pittman have ever been admitted to the practice of law.Â  At \r\n  no time relevant to the facts in the Agreement were any persons employed by \r\n  ASI or RES licensed to practice law. Â Respondent had no interest in either ASI \r\n  or RES and paid them as independent contractors for their services on a case-by-case \r\n  basis.Â  \r\n The functions provided by RES and ASI included \r\n  communication with lenders, realtors, buyers and sellers, title abstract searches, \r\n  the preparation and review of legal documents for closings, attendance at closings, \r\n  issuance of title insurance, the receipt and disbursement of funds for the transaction, \r\n  and completion of follow up tasks, including but not limited to recording documents \r\n  in the public records.Â  In connection with the handling of the funds for real \r\n  estate closings for respondent, ASI provided an â€œescrow service.â€Â  All of these \r\n  functions took place at the offices of RES and/or ASI with the exception of \r\n  the actual closings which usually took place at respondentâ€™s office.Â  Almost \r\n  all U.S. mail, facsimiles, and other communications and deliveries related to \r\n  these functions were directed to the offices of RES and/or ASI, as were almost \r\n  all telephonic communications concerning real estate closings by respondent.Â  \r\n\r\nIn real estate closings, RES and/or ASI utilized computer \r\n  generated stationary with respondentâ€™s law office letterhead.Â  Use of respondentâ€™s \r\n  letterhead in this fashion was with respondentâ€™s knowledge and consent.Â  By \r\n  using respondentâ€™s letterhead and through other means which were known to respondent \r\n  and to which respondent consented, Knox represented herself as and caused others \r\n  to believe that she was an employee of respondent or respondentâ€™s law firm when, \r\n  in fact, she was not respondentâ€™s employee during the period relevant to the \r\n  Agreement.Â  \r\nIn completing the functions described above, neither \r\n  RES nor ASIâ€™s owners or employees were supervised by a licensed attorney.Â  Respondent \r\n  did not supervise the work of either RES or ASI, except to review the closing \r\n  documents and title abstract prior to closings.Â  Generally, all communications \r\n  concerning ASIâ€™s services were directly between respondent and Knox and any \r\n  services needed from RES were obtained by Knox.Â  Likewise, most communications \r\n  with lenders and parties to the real estate transactions were handled by Knox, \r\n  not respondent.Â  \r\nRespondent caused or permitted all funds for these \r\n  real estate transactions assisted by RES and ASI to be deposited or wired into \r\n  the ASI â€œReal Estate Accountâ€ which was maintained by ASI at its office.Â  Respondent \r\n  directed funds being transferred by wire to be wired by lenders directly to \r\n  the ASI account managed by Knox at ASIâ€™s office.Â  When respondent received checks \r\n  made payable to his order or the order of his law firm, respondent endorsed \r\n  the checks and delivered them to Knox.Â  ASIâ€™s bank account was not an IOLTA \r\n  account and it was solely controlled by ASI owner and manager Knox.Â  Bank statements \r\n  and cancelled checks were sent directly to ASI.Â  Knox had exclusive signatory \r\n  authority over this bank account and controlled all aspects of it, including \r\n  deposits, disbursements, possession of checks and deposit slips, and the receipt \r\n  of monthly bank statements, cancelled checks, and other documents propagated \r\n  by the bank concerning account activity, all of which was maintained by and \r\n  in custody and control of Knox at ASIâ€™s office.Â  With the exception of a review \r\n  of the ledger accounts for each closing prepared by Knox, which respondent represents \r\n  he performed, respondent never inspected or audited the ASI account used by \r\n  Knox to deposit and thereafter disburse the proceeds of respondentâ€™s real estate \r\n  closings handled by ASI and RES. \r\nThe arrangement between respondent and ASI (utilizing \r\n  the services of RES) was in effect for approximately four years.Â  Either during \r\n  or after each of the numerous transactions involving RES/ASI, respondent signed \r\n  the HUD-1 Settlement Statement attesting to the representation printed on the \r\n  Settlement Statement that respondent certified the funds itemized were an â€œaccurate \r\n  account of the funds which were received and have been or will be disbursed \r\n  by the undersigned . . .â€ (emphasis added) or words of similar import \r\n  or effect.Â  The term â€œundersignedâ€ on each of these HUD-1 Settlement Statements \r\n  refers to respondent.Â  In fact, respondent made no disbursements in connection \r\n  with the RES/ASI assisted real estate transactions and, instead, entrusted the \r\n  disbursements to be made by Knox from ASIâ€™s bank account, the checks and records \r\n  of which were maintained by Knox at ASIâ€™s office.Â  Respondent estimates he consummated \r\n  approximately 1051 real estate closings by using the services of ASI and/or \r\n  RES under the foregoing arrangement with Knox making disbursement of the proceeds \r\n  from the ASI bank account controlled by Knox.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn or around February 2004, respondent learned from \r\n  Knoxâ€™s attorney that approximately twelve mortgage payoffs related to real estate \r\n  closings for respondentâ€™s clients handed by ASI and RES had not been paid.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, respondent made inquiries to Knox about these open and unpaid mortgages \r\n  which should have been paid in full out of the proceeds of the closings.Â  When \r\n  confronted, Knox acknowledged to respondent that she had misappropriated funds \r\n  from the ASI account related to closings for respondentâ€™s clients.Â  Knox then \r\n  produced a document itemizing the transactions in which there were shortages \r\n  and the amounts thereof.Â  From the documentation submitted in support of the \r\n  Agreement, it appears the total amount of funds from respondentâ€™s clients misappropriated \r\n  by Knox was approximately $1,151,075.04.Â  These misappropriated monies were \r\n  funds that had been deposited in the ASI real estate account from closings ASI \r\n  handled for respondent.Â  These missing funds represent monies allocated for \r\n  payoffs of mortgages from twelve of respondentâ€™s clients.Â  Each of the HUD-1 \r\n  Settlement Statements from the twelve closings from which money was appropriated \r\n  bears respondentâ€™s signature as â€œSettlement Agent.â€Â  One million one hundred \r\n  fifty one thousand seventy five dollars and four cents remains missing.Â  \r\nAfter learning of Knoxâ€™s misappropriation, respondent \r\n  immediately filed a self-report with Disciplinary Counsel and with his errors \r\n  and omissions carrier and subsequently paid all amounts due on the mortgages.Â  \r\n  Knox was indicted and subsequently pled guilty to the misappropriation of $1,151,075.04.Â  \r\n  Knox admitted to perpetrating an ongoing scheme of retaining mortgage payoffs \r\n  from respondentâ€™s closings over a period of approximately four years.Â  It is \r\n  now known to respondent that Knox had been regularly misappropriating funds \r\n  from closings she handled for respondent and was replacing monies previously \r\n  misappropriated with monies from subsequent closings until her scheme became \r\n  known.Â  \r\nRespondent did not at any time relevant to the foregoing \r\n  advise any of his clients of any limitations on his representation in connection \r\n  with real estate closings.Â  He did not advise his clients that unsupervised \r\n  non-lawyers were entrusted with the disbursement and accounting of all closing \r\n  funds, as well as the preparation and completion of closing documents and recording \r\n  of the same. \r\nÂ Before Knoxâ€™s misappropriation scheme was discovered, \r\n  respondent became concerned about liability related to his arrangement with \r\n  Knox due to certain problems that arose with closings using ASI and/or RES services.Â  \r\n  These problems were unrelated to and not indicative of Knoxâ€™s misappropriations.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, respondent required Knox to present him with evidence of errors \r\n  and omission insurance policies related to the services being provided.Â  Respondent \r\n  now recognizes that ASI/RESâ€™ insurance policies covered only errors and omissions \r\n  and that the policies did not provide coverage for misappropriation. \r\nDuring the period of respondentâ€™s foregoing arrangement \r\n  with RES/ASI, respondent maintained the closing documents but did not maintain \r\n  the related disbursement records as required by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  during this period, respondent failed to reconcile or even inspect ASIâ€™s bank \r\n  account used for deposits and disbursements of the funds of respondentâ€™s clients \r\n  as required by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Additionally, respondent never inspected or \r\n  audited the â€œReal Estate Accountâ€ of ASI.Â  As a result, respondent failed to \r\n  safekeep the funds of his clients and others and, in so doing, assisted Knox \r\n  in the unauthorized practice of law. \r\nÂ Respondent now recognizes that allowing non-employees \r\n  to have access to and control over money which belongs to clients and others \r\n  and was entrusted to respondent as a result of real estate closings constituted \r\n  misconduct regardless of whether there were shortages in the â€œescrow serviceâ€ \r\n  account provided by ASI.Â  Respondent now recognizes and acknowledges that the \r\n  use of an â€œescrow serviceâ€ as provided by Knox constitutes lawyer misconduct, \r\n  regardless of whether the funds were missing and whether the recordkeeping requirements \r\n  of Rule 417, SCACR, were conducted by respondent.Â  \r\nTo ODCâ€™s best knowledge and belief, respondent fully \r\n  cooperated with ODCâ€™s inquiries into this matter.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated \r\n  the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  \r\n  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to client); Rule 1.2(c) \r\n  (lawyer may limit objectives of representation with client consent after consultation); \r\n  Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter); \r\n  Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safeguard property of client; lawyer shall maintain \r\n  complete records of account funds); Rule 5.3 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts \r\n  to ensure firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance conduct of \r\n  non-lawyer retained by lawyer is compatible with professional obligations of \r\n  lawyer; lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of non-lawyer retained by the \r\n  lawyer if that conduct would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct \r\n  if engaged in by lawyer and lawyer ratifies the conduct); Rule 5.5(b) (lawyer \r\n  shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the unauthorized \r\n  practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, \r\n  fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage \r\n  in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â In addition, \r\n  respondent admits he failed to comply with the recordkeeping provisions of Rule \r\n  417, SCACR.Â  Finally, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation \r\n  of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall \r\n  not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction \r\n  regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not \r\n  engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring \r\n  the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an \r\n  unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely \r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law for a sixty (60) day period.Â  Within \r\n  fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., not participating. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25899","title":"Sloan v.

Miller, both of The Carpenter Law Firm, \r\n  PC, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  We granted certiorari to consider a Court \r\n  of Appealsâ€™ decision reversing the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal as moot of two \r\n  suits brought by respondent (Sloan). [1] Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, Op. No. \r\n  2002-UP-598 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 1, 2002).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nSloan brought this action \r\n  against petitioners (collectively â€˜Countyâ€™) seeking a declaration that County \r\n  had violated its procurement ordinance in contracting a 1998 road construction \r\n  project and a 1999 family court renovation project.Â  The ordinance permits the \r\n  County to choose between several bidding methods when awarding these contracts, \r\n  and requires there be a written â€œdetermination for the method of source selection \r\n  utilized.â€Â  Sloan challenges the adequacy of the written determinations in these \r\n  two projects.Â  Both projects were completed before the suits were heard.\r\nThe circuit court dismissed \r\n  the road suit on the ground of mootness, rejecting Sloanâ€™s contention that the \r\n  â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception to mootness should be applied.Â  The family court \r\n  renovation suit was also dismissed as moot and the â€œpublic importanceâ€ argument \r\n  was similarly rejected.\r\nThe family court case \r\n  and the 1998 road case were heard together at the trial level and the orders \r\n  of dismissal were consolidated for appeal.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the \r\n  orders dismissing the suits.Â  We granted Countyâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s dismissal of Sloanâ€™s suits as moot?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThis Court has recognized a â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception to mootness \r\n  holding that â€œan appellate court may decide questions of imperative and manifest \r\n  urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public \r\n  interest.â€Â  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001)(internal \r\n  citations omitted).Â  The determination whether a particular suit raises â€œquestions \r\n  of imperative and manifest urgencyâ€ must be decided on an individual basis.Â  \r\n  In this case, the Court of Appeals focused not on the standard for invoking \r\n  this exception (â€œquestions of imperative and manifest urgencyâ€), but instead \r\n  on the label applied to it (â€œmatter of important public interestâ€).Â  In seeking \r\n  to define important public interest for purposes of applying this exception, \r\n  the Court of Appeals relied upon one of its decisions which held that, for purposes \r\n  of determining taxpayer standing, â€œthe expenditure of public funds pursuant \r\n  to a competitive bidding statute is of immense public importance.â€Â  Sloan \r\n  v. School Dist. Of Greenville County, 342 S.C. 515, 537 S.E.2d 299 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000).Â  Relying upon this ruling, the court concluded â€œthe competitive \r\n  sealed bidding process is a question of public importance, both in the context \r\n  of standing and in the context of [Countyâ€™s compliance with the procurement \r\n  ordinanceâ€™s requirement] of the written determination.â€Â  Sloan v. Greenville \r\n  County, supra.\r\nThe Court of Appeals applied an incorrect standard, substituting â€œpublic importanceâ€ \r\n  for â€œimperative and manifest urgency.â€Â  Further, the court erred in adopting \r\n  a categorical exception to the mootness doctrine for cases questioning the competitive \r\n  sealed bidding process.Â  Such an approach is inconsistent with the limited nature \r\n  of the exception for questions of â€œimperative and manifest urgency.â€\r\nSloan would have the \r\n  courts declare whether written source selection determinations made by County \r\n  in awarding a 1998 road construction project and a 1999 family court renovation \r\n  project were adequate.Â  Assuming without deciding that Countyâ€™s compliance with \r\n  its procurement ordinance is an issue of public importance for purposes of invoking \r\n  this exception to the mootness doctrine, we must determine whether the questions \r\n  posed involve matters of â€œimperative and manifest urgency.â€ \r\n Since these actions were commenced, the Court of Appeals has issued \r\n  two opinions addressing the adequacy of the Countyâ€™s written determinations \r\n  under the procurement ordinance. Â See Sloan v. Greenville County, \r\n  Op. No. 2004-UP-277 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 22, 2004) (written determinations \r\n  used in 2001-2002 road projects); Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. \r\n  531, 590 S.E.2d 338 (2003) (2000 and 2001 road projects and 1999 forensics lab \r\n  renovation).Â  These two opinions provide County the judicial guidance in drafting \r\n  the determinations that Sloan is seeking in the present cases.Â  Further, the \r\n  County ordinance has been amended and now requires an independent monitor to \r\n  oversee the procurement of design-build services, and requires public notice \r\n  and an opportunity to be heard when the project cost exceeds $5 million.Â  In \r\n  light of these developments, we hold there is no imperative or manifest urgency \r\n  in obtaining an advisory opinion on the application of an obsolete procurement \r\n  ordinance to these completed projects. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion, which reversed the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of these suits as moot, \r\n  is \r\nREVERSED.\r\n WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  MOORE, J., dissenting in a separate \r\n  opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE MOORE (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent from the majority \r\n  opinion because I believe the Court of Appeals properly reversed the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s dismissal of two suits brought by respondent (Sloan).Â  I would affirm \r\n  as modified the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion and find that Sloanâ€™s suits are not \r\n  moot and that Sloan has standing to bring the suits in circuit court.\r\nMootness\r\n An appellate court will not pass on moot and academic questions or \r\n  make an adjudication where there remains no actual controversy.Â  Curtis v. \r\n  State, 345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. \r\n  926 (2002).Â  Moot appeals differ from unripe appeals in that moot appeals result \r\n  when intervening events render a case nonjusticiable.Â  Id.Â  A case becomes \r\n  moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon the \r\n  existing controversy.Â  Id.Â  This is true when some event occurs making \r\n  it impossible for the reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.Â  Id.\r\nAn exception to the mootness doctrine is that questions of public \r\n  interest originally encompassed in an action should be decided for future guidance, \r\n  however abstract or moot they may have become in the immediate contest.Â  Ashmore \r\n  v. Greater Greenville Sewer Dist., 211 S.C. 77, 44 S.E.2d 88 (1947).Â  The \r\n  Court of Appeals found, pursuant to Ashmore, that this case falls into \r\n  the public importance exception to the mootness doctrine and that a ruling on \r\n  the merits of Sloanâ€™s suits would provide future guidance to petitioner.\r\nThe majority, relying on Curtis v. State, supra, finds \r\n  the Court of Appeals applied the incorrect standard for determining whether \r\n  a case falls into the public importance exception to the mootness doctrine.Â  \r\n  The majority states â€œthe Court of Appeals focused not on the standard for invoking \r\n  this exception (â€œquestions of imperative and manifest urgencyâ€), but instead \r\n  on the label applied to it (â€œmatter of important public interestâ€).â€\r\nThis Court, in Curtis, stated that one exception to the mootness \r\n  doctrine is that:Â  â€œan appellate court may decide questions of imperative \r\n  and manifest urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in matters \r\n  of important public interest.â€Â  Curtis, 345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d \r\n  at 596 (emphasis added).Â  However, I do not believe Curtis, via the language \r\n  italicized above, imposed an additional requirement to the public importance \r\n  exception to the mootness doctrine.Â  To read Curtis to impose a requirement \r\n  that a question must be of â€œimperative and manifest urgencyâ€ to meet the public \r\n  importance exception is against the jurisprudence of this state.Â  See \r\n  Berry v. Zahler, 220 S.C. 86, 66 S.E.2d 459 (1951) (questions of public \r\n  interest should be decided for future guidance, however abstract or moot they \r\n  may have become in the immediate contest); Ashmore v. Greater Greenville \r\n  Dist., supra (same).Â  I would hold that questions of public interest \r\n  should be decided for future guidance without a requirement that there be some \r\n  urgency to the matter. \r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals correctly held that this case falls squarely \r\n  within the public interest exception.Â  As the Court of Appeals has noted in \r\n  a similar case, an important public interest exists in the stewardship of public \r\n  funds and a strong need exists to provide guidance for future procurement decisions.Â  \r\n  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 590 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 2003) \r\n  (Sloan 2003).Â  The inability to provide any effective relief in a case \r\n  should not be a barrier to the courtâ€™s consideration of a question of exceptional \r\n  public interest.Â  Id.\r\nBecause a question of important public interest is involved, I would \r\n  hold the Court of Appeals properly reversed the circuit courtâ€™s decision to \r\n  dismiss the suits as moot.\r\nStanding\r\nAlthough the Court of Appeals did not address the issue whether Sloan \r\n  had standing to bring the suits against petitioners, I would now address this \r\n  issue.Â  \r\nTo have standing to institute an action, one must have a personal stake in \r\n  the subject matter of the lawsuit.Â  Evins v. Richland County Historic Pres. \r\n  Commâ€™n, 341 S.C. 15, 532 S.E.2d 876 (2000).Â  This Court has consistently \r\n  held that a private individual may not invoke the judicial power to determine \r\n  the validity of an executive or legislative act unless the private individual \r\n  can show that, as a result of that action, a direct injury has been sustained, \r\n  or that there is immediate danger a direct injury will be sustained.Â  Joytime \r\n  Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 528 S.E.2d 647 \r\n  (1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1087 (2000).Â  Moreover, the injury must \r\n  be of a personal nature to the party bringing the action, not merely of a general \r\n  nature that is common to all members of the public.Â  Id.Â  \r\n The general rule is that a taxpayer may not maintain a suit to enjoin \r\n  the action of State officers when he has no special interest and his only standing \r\n  is the exceedingly small interest of a general taxpayer.Â  Crews v. Beattie, \r\n  197 S.C. 32, 14 S.E.2d 351 (1941).Â  The mere fact that the issue is one of public \r\n  importance does not confer upon any citizen or taxpayer the right to invoke \r\n  a judicial determination of the issue.Â  Id.Â  For a plaintiff to have \r\n  taxpayer standing, the party must demonstrate some overriding public purpose \r\n  or concern to confer standing to sue on behalf of his fellow taxpayers.Â  Sloan \r\n  v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 590 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  See \r\n  also Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999) \r\n  (standing may be conferred upon a party when an issue is of such public importance \r\n  as to require its resolution for future guidance).\r\nSloan has standing because the question presented is of such substantial \r\n  public importance as to warrant a resolution for future guidance.Â  See, \r\n  e.g. Sloan v. School Dist. Of Greenville County, 342 S.C. 515, \r\n  537 S.E.2d 299 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The public interest involved is the prevention \r\n  of the unlawful expenditure of money raised by taxation.Â  \r\nWith specific regard to procurement of services for public works projects, \r\n  the Court of Appeals has found:\r\n\r\nThe expenditure of public funds pursuant to a competitive bidding statute is \r\n  of immense public importance.Â  Requiring that contracts only be awarded through \r\n  the process of competitive sealed bidding demonstrates the lengths to which \r\n  our government believes it should go to maintain the publicâ€™s trust and confidence \r\n  in governmental management of public funds.Â  The integrity of the competitive \r\n  sealed bidding process is so important that in some states â€œonce a contract \r\n  is proved to have been awarded without the required competitive bidding, a waste \r\n  of public funds [is] presumed ... without showing that the municipality suffered \r\n  any alleged injury.â€\r\n\r\nSloan 2003, 356 S.C. at 550-551, 590 S.E.2d at 348-349 (citation and \r\n  quotation omitted).\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ reasoning in Sloan 2000 and Sloan \r\n  2003 compels the same result in the instant case.Â  Here, Sloan has an interest \r\n  as a taxpayer in how public funds were spent.Â  The projects required the expenditure \r\n  of millions of taxpayer dollars and this burden was borne exclusively by the \r\n  taxpaying citizens of Greenville County.Â  Sloan, therefore, has a material interest \r\n  in whether the County followed the procurement procedures set out in the county \r\n  code.\r\nAs stated in Sloan 2003, the issue in the present case is \r\n  of sufficient public importance to confer standing.Â  Resolution of the issues \r\n  in this case will likely have an impact on government practices beyond the confines \r\n  of the case itself.Â  Greenville County and other public entities must be accountable \r\n  under the laws that govern how they spend public money.\r\nFor these reasons, Sloan has standing to pursue these suits in the \r\n  circuit court.Â  Therefore, I would affirm as modified the opinion of the Court \r\n  of Appeals.\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The cases were combined for purposes of this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25900","title":"Allendale Sheriff v.

Woodrow Gooding, of Gooding &amp; Gooding, of \r\n  Allendale; and Jonathan Scott Altman, of Derfner, Altman &amp; Wilborn, of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  The \r\n  magistrate court ruled, and the circuit court affirmed, that the two Chess Challenge \r\n  II machines examined, and all machines operating in a similar manner, are games \r\n  of skill that are lawful to possess.Â  After certifying this appeal for review \r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, we reverse in part and affirm in part.\r\nFactual/Procedural \r\n  Background\r\nOn September 23, 2003, the Allendale County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Office (Sheriffâ€™s Office) received an anonymous phone call that video poker \r\n  machines were being placed in Bertâ€™s Fast Stop, a convenience store in Fairfax, \r\n  South Carolina.Â  Two machines were found and taken to the magistrateâ€™s office \r\n  for a ruling as to their legality.\r\nThe machines contained the game Chess Challenge \r\n  II, a coin-operated game that has a payout feature.Â  The game has four rotating \r\n  reels in which seven icons spin according to a fixed sequence.Â  Seven different \r\n  icons (pawn, shield, horse, castle, prince, queen, and king) appear in various \r\n  combinations over the course of a fixed 255-icon sequence and then repeat.Â  \r\n  The player is able to stop each reel individually by pushing the corresponding \r\n  button.Â  To win, a player must match icons on three of the four reels.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAfter examining the machines, hearing oral argument, considering \r\n  expert reports, play trials, and affidavits, \r\n  [1]  the magistrate ruled the following: \r\n\r\n[t]he Chess Challenge II games examined and all those \r\n  operating in an identical manner are games of skill that are lawful \r\n  to possess, own and operate under South Carolina law as redemption machines \r\n  distributing prizes, including gift certificates, and merchandise. \r\n\r\n(emphases added).Â  \r\nIn addition, the magistrate found that the developer of Chess \r\n  Challenge II had â€œtaken certain measures to insure that all Chess Challenge \r\n  II games operate in the identical manner as those examined,â€ which would allow \r\n  â€œlaw enforcement to quickly detect whether any effort [had] been made to alter \r\n  the operational characteristicsâ€ of the game. \r\nAfter the ruling, the solicitor filed a notice \r\n  of appeal on behalf of the Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  But at the beginning of the hearing, \r\n  the solicitor asked the judge to deny the appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Solicitor:\r\n       Your Honor please, I have reviewed the order of \r\n  [the magistrate].Â  I have reviewed the information that was presented during \r\n  that hearing.Â  I have reviewed the machine and I have listened to the advice \r\n  of someone in whom I have great confidence and faith, and I withdraw my appeal.Â  \r\n  Donâ€™t withdraw my appeal, sir, I think you should deny my appeal.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The Court:\r\n       So you think I should affirm the judgment of Judge \r\n  Love?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Solicitor:&nbsp;\r\n       Yes, sir.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;Based on the solicitorâ€™s request, and without further consideration, \r\n  the circuit judge affirmed the magistrateâ€™s order.\r\n Four days later, the solicitor inexplicably filed \r\n  a motion for reconsideration on the basis that the magistrate did not have the \r\n  authority to find that the machines examined and all those operating in an identical \r\n  manner were lawful.Â  The motion was denied.\r\nSoon after, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) \r\n  filed a motion for relief from the order and an alternative motion to alter, \r\n  amend or reconsider, arguing that jurisdiction was proper only as to the two \r\n  machines before the court, not as to machines operating in an identical manner \r\n  throughout the state.Â  Moreover, SLED argued that because it was not served \r\n  with notice or given an opportunity to be heard, it was not bound by the courtâ€™s \r\n  order.\r\nSLED subsequently withdrew its motion for relief, and moved, \r\n  instead, to intervene and to have the case certified to this Court.Â  Both motions \r\n  were granted.\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Office and SLED have raised the following issues \r\n  for review:\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the lower courts \r\n  have jurisdiction to rule on the legality of Chess Challenge II machines not \r\n  before the court?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the magistrateâ€™s order void for \r\n  lack of controversy and lack of notice to SLED? \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen there is any evidence, however slight, tending \r\n  to prove the issues involved, this Court may not question a magistrate courtâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact that were approved by a circuit court on appeal.Â  State \r\n  v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 185, 525 S.E.2d \r\n  872, 876 (2000).Â  An action for forfeiture of property is a civil action at \r\n  law.Â  Id.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Lack of \r\n  Jurisdiction\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Office and SLED contend that the magistrate \r\n  lacked jurisdiction to determine the legality of machines that were not before \r\n  the court.Â  We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina statutory law prescribes the procedure for \r\n  seizing and destroying unlawful machines:\r\n\r\n[a]ny machine, board, or other device prohibited by Section \r\n  12-21-2710 [2]  must be seized by any law enforcement \r\n  officer and at once taken before any magistrate of the county in which the machine, \r\n  board, or device is seized who shall immediately examine it, and if satisfied \r\n  that it is in violation of Section 12-21-2710 or any other law of this State, \r\n  direct that it be immediately destroyed.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2712 (2000).\r\nIn general, it is within the Stateâ€™s police power to take \r\n  gaming devices by forfeiture.Â  Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v. Stewart, 341 \r\n  S.C. 297, 303, 534 S.E.2d 270, 273 (2000).Â  An action for forfeiture is a civil \r\n  in rem action at law that is, by its nature, a penal action that must \r\n  be strictly construed.Â  Pope v. Gordon, 359 S.C. 572, 581, 598 S.E.2d \r\n  288, 293 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Consequently, in rem forfeiture statutes must \r\n  be interpreted in light of the evil sought to be remedied and in a manner that \r\n  is consistent with the statuteâ€™s purpose.Â  Id. (quoting Ducworth v. \r\n  Neely, 319 S.C. 158, 162, 459 S.E.2d 896, 899 (Ct. App. 1995)).Â  \r\nThe facts in a prior decision by this Court demonstrate that \r\n  the seizure and destruction process outlined in section 12-21-2712 must be followed \r\n  even when the machines seized have been previously deemed illegal.Â  In 192 \r\n  Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, SLED seized 192 â€œCherry Masterâ€ and â€œ8-Linerâ€ \r\n  video machines.Â  Id. at 183, 525 S.E.2d at 876.Â  These machines had previously \r\n  been deemed illegal gambling devices by this Court. See State v. One Coin-Operated \r\n  Video Game Machine, 321 S.C. 176, 467 S.E.2d 443 (1996) (finding â€œCherry \r\n  Masterâ€ is an illegal slot machine); State v. Four Video Slot Machines, \r\n  317 S.C. 397, 453 S.E.2d 896 (1995) (finding â€œLucky 8 Lineâ€ is an illegal slot \r\n  machine).Â  Although the machines had previously been deemed illegal, the seizure \r\n  and forfeiture process outlined in section 12-21-2712 was still followed: SLED \r\n  obtained a search warrant and seized the 192 machines; and the magistrate personally \r\n  examined the machines, determined that they were illegal, and ordered their \r\n  destruction. 192 Coin-Operated, 338 S.C. at 183, 525 S.E.2d at 875.Â  \r\n\r\nAlso while at the warehouse, SLED discovered an additional \r\n  23 machines that it believed were illegal.Â  Once again, SLED obtained a search \r\n  warrant and seized the machines; a magistrate examined them, found them to be \r\n  illegal, and ordered their destruction.Â  Id.Â  This Court affirmed both \r\n  destruction orders. Id. at 202, 525 S.E.2d at 886.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the magistrate ruled on the legality \r\n  of the two machines before the court and â€œall those [machines] operating in \r\n  an identical manner.â€Â  This broad ruling exceeded the scope of the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  authority and is contrary to the machine-by-machine forfeiture process outlined \r\n  in the statute and carried out in other cases.Â  Therefore, we find that the \r\n  magistrate court lacked jurisdiction to determine the legality of machines not \r\n  before court.Â Â \r\nAs to the two machines seized, examined, and deemed legal, \r\n  there is nothing preventing the Sheriffâ€™s Office or other law enforcement officials \r\n  from seizing the machines once again for the magistrateâ€™s examination. Because \r\n  video machines may be manipulated so as to change their nature from lawful to \r\n  unlawful, law enforcement may, based on probable cause, seize the machines in \r\n  question once again.Â  In other words, the effect of the magistrateâ€™s order is \r\n  that it deems the machines lawful at the time they were seized and examined.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Other \r\n  Grounds\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Office and SLED argue that the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  ruling is void because (1) an actual controversy did not exist, and (2) SLED \r\n  was not notified of the proceedings.Â  We disagree with both arguments.Â  \r\nFirst, in support of their argument that the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  ruling is void for lack of controversy, the Sheriffâ€™s Office and SLED claim \r\n  that they were not given the opportunity to present evidence that the machines \r\n  were illegal.Â  While it is true that the magistrateâ€™s order only cites evidence \r\n  presented by Respondents, there is no evidence in the record suggesting that \r\n  the Sheriff or other law enforcement officials did not have an opportunity to \r\n  present evidence that the machines were illegal.Â  \r\nSecond, a plain reading of the statute does not support the \r\n  argument that the magistrateâ€™s order should be voided because SLED was not notified \r\n  of the forfeiture hearing.Â  See State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, \r\n  403 S.E.2d 660 (1991) (a statute must be given its plain and ordinary meaning).Â  \r\n  The statute states that the machines may be â€œseized by any law enforcement officer.â€Â  \r\n  Nothing in the statute specifically provides that SLED must be notified before \r\n  the magistrate makes a determination.Â  \r\nTherefore, the magistrateâ€™s order should not be voided for \r\n  lack of controversy or lack of notice to SLED.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe affirm the magistrateâ€™s decision finding that \r\n  the two Chess Challenge II machines seized and examined were lawful.Â  Because \r\n  the magistrate did not have the authority to deem â€œall those [machines] operating \r\n  in an identical mannerâ€ lawful, we reverse that portion of the ruling. \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  G. Thomas Cooper, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  An affidavit by Solicitor Ralph Hoisington was submitted in which \r\n    he stated the following: â€œit is my belief that the Chess Challenge II game \r\n    operates in a different manner from the illegal games of chance that have \r\n    appeared in the state of South Carolina. Chess Challenge II operates utilizing \r\n    a repeating pattern and does not utilize features that would prevent a playerâ€™s \r\n    skill from determining the outcome of the game.Â  In addition, a player is \r\n    able to identify the icons as they appear, and to time the stopping of the \r\n    game to increase the chance of winning.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  This section provides, in part, the following:Â  [i]t is unlawful \r\n    for any person to keep on his premises or operate â€¦ any vending or slot machine, \r\n    punch board, pull board, or other device pertaining to games of chance â€¦ including \r\n    those â€¦ that display different pictures, words, or symbols, at different plays \r\n    or numbers, whether in words or figures or, which deposit tokens or coins \r\n    at regular intervals or in varying numbers to the player or in the machine \r\n    â€¦.â€Â  S.C.

Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in State v. Cherry, 348 S.C. 281, 559 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  We affirm in result.\r\nFACTS\r\nCherry was convicted of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute (PWID crack) and sentenced to five years and a twenty-five thousand dollar fine.[1]Â  The stateâ€™s evidence at trial showed that Cherry was a passenger in the back seat of a vehicle which was stopped for going straight from a left turn lane and for failing to use a signal.Â  Officer Parker, who stopped the car, testified that while he was writing out a citation, his backup, Officer Lubben, observed the driver of the vehicle place a pistol in a diaper bag; the driver was arrested.Â  Officer Parker then asked the passengers to exit the vehicle.Â  A pat-down search of Cherry revealed 8 rocks of crack cocaine in the watch pocket of his jeans.[2]Â  The officer testified that he found $322.00, mostly in twenty-dollar bills, in Cherryâ€™s left front pocket, and that crack cocaine is usually sold in twenty dollar rocks.Â  Officer Parker also testified he did not find any drug paraphernalia or crack pipes in the car which would typically be associated with smoking rock cocaine.Â  Lastly, Officer Parker testified that the stop was made in a high crime area known for drugs.Â  \r\nAt the close of the stateâ€™s evidence, Cherryâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on PWID crack was denied.Â  Thereafter, the court instructed the jury on â€œcircumstantial evidence,â€ essentially giving the charge recommended by this Court in State v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 83-84, 489 S.E.2d 462, 464 (1998) to wit:\r\n\r\n  There are two types of evidence which are generally presented during a trial--direct evidence and circumstantial evidence.Â  Direct evidence is the testimony of a person who asserts or claims to have actual knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness.Â  Circumstantial evidence is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating the existence of a fact.Â  The law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence.Â  Nor is a greater degree of certainty required of circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence.Â  You should weigh all the evidence in the case.Â  After weighing all the evidence, if you are not convinced of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find [the defendant] not guilty.[3]\r\n\r\nAfter the judge finished instructing the jury, Cherry requested an instruction on the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence, essentially to the effect that in considering circumstantial evidence, all of the circumstances proven must be consistent with each other and taken together, point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.[4]Â  The court declined the charge; the jury convicted Cherry of PWID crack. \r\nOn appeal, Cherry contended he was entitled to a directed verdict on the charge of PWID crack, and that the trial judge erred in refusing to give a traditional circumstantial evidence charge, pursuant to State v. Edwards supra.Â  The case was initially decided by a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed Cherryâ€™s conviction.[5] An en banc rehearing yielded six separate opinions.Â Â  Three judges (Stilwell, Huff and Goolsby) voted to affirm, believing that the PWID charge was properly submitted to the jury and that the circumstantial evidence charge was proper under Grippon.Â  Four judges (Howard, Hearn, Cureton and Connor)[6] believed Cherry was entitled to a directed verdict on the PWID crack charge, and three (Anderson, Shuler, and Connor[7]) believed Cherry should have been given a fuller circumstantial evidence charge.Â  Cherryâ€™s conviction was affirmed.Â  State v. Cherry, 348 S.C. 281, 559 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Cherry entitled to a directed verdict on the PWID crack charge?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the trial court have given a fuller circumstantial evidence charge pursuant to State v. Edwards?\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nCherry contends there was insufficient evidence of his intent to distribute crack cocaine, such that he was entitled to a directed verdict on the PWID crack charge.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n In his majority opinion, Judge Stilwell cited the following evidence warranting submission of the case to the jury:Â  the arrest occurred in a high crime area known for violence and drug activity; Cherry had a small bag containing eight rocks of crack cocaine on his person; he had no crack pipe or other drug paraphernalia indicating the crack cocaine was for his personal consumption; he had $322.00 cash on his person, mostly in twenty dollar bills; and Officer Parker testified a single rock of crack cocaine is typically sold for twenty dollars.Â  Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the Court of Appeals majority found the combination of these factors constitute evidence which would reasonably tend to prove Cherry intended to distribute crack such that the matter was properly submitted to the jury.Â  We agree.\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002).Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the state fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171, cert. denied, 124 S.Ct. 101 (2003); State v. Rothschild, 351 S.C. 238, 243, 569 S.E.2d 346, 348 (2002).Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the state.Â  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002); State v. Venters, 300 S.C. 260, 264, 387 S.E.2d 270, 272-73 (1990).Â  See also State v. Gaster, supra (on an appeal from trial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict, appellate court may only reverse the trial court if there is no evidence to support the trial court's ruling).Â  \r\nWhen the state relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence and a motion for directed verdict is made, the circuit court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not with its weight. Â State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000).Â  The circuit court should not refuse to grant the directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  Id. at 409, 535 S.E.2d at 127.Â Â  &quot;Suspicion&quot; implies a belief or opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001).Â  However, a trial judge is not required to find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.Â  State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 470 S.E.2d 851 (1996); State v. Edwards, supra.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Edwards, supra, we rejected the contention that in ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial judge must grant a directed verdict unless the circumstantial evidence pointed conclusively to the defendantâ€™s guilt, to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.Â  Instead, we held it is the trial judgeâ€™s â€œduty to submit the case to the jury if there be any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.â€Â  298 S.C. at 275, 379 S.E.2d at 889, citing State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924 (1955) (emphasis in original).Â Â  \r\nHere, there was evidence at trial which reasonably tended to prove Cherryâ€™s guilt of PWID, and from which a jury could fairly and logically deduce his guilt of that offense.Â  As noted previously, the evidence relied upon to prove PWID crack was as follows: the arrest occurred in a high crime area known for violence and drug activity; Cherry had a small bag containing eight rocks of crack cocaine on his person; he had no crack pipe or other drug paraphernalia indicating the crack cocaine was for his personal consumption; he had $322.00 cash on his person, mostly in twenty dollar bills; and Officer Parker testified a single rock of crack cocaine is typically sold for twenty dollars.[8]Â  We find this combination of factors is sufficient for the jury to infer an intent to distribute.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is affirmed on this issue.Â Â Â  \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE CHARGE\r\nCherry asserts the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury the law of circumstantial evidence, as set forth by this Court in State v. Littlejohn, supra, and State v. Edwards, supra.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTraditionally, when charging the jury in a circumstantial evidence case, the following was the recommended instruction:\r\n\r\n  every circumstance relied upon by the State [must]Â  be proven beyond a reasonable doubt;Â  and . . . all of the circumstances so proven be consistent with each other and taken together, point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.Â  It is not sufficient that they create a probability, though a strong one and if, assuming them to be true they may be accounted for upon any reasonable hypothesis which does not include the guilt of the accused, the proof has failed.\r\n\r\nState v. Edwards, 298 S.C. at 275, 379 S.E.2d at 889, citing State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1955) (emphasis supplied).\r\nHowever, in 1997, in light of the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), a majority of this Court held in State v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997), that so long as the jury is properly instructed on reasonable doubt, it is unnecessary for the trial court to instruct the jury that â€œcircumstantial evidence must be so strong as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt.â€Â  Id. at 83, 489 S.E.2d at 464.\r\nIn Grippon, the defendant was indicted for murder, but convicted of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Grippon asserted he had stabbed the victim after the victim attempted to rape him.Â  The trial judge charged the jury the law of circumstantial evidence, but omitted the phrase â€œto the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis,â€ believing the phrase shifted the burden of proof from the state to the defendant.[9]Â  Although this Court held that the â€œreasonable hypothesisâ€ language did not shift the burden of proof, we held the instruction actually given by the trial court, adequately conveyed the level of proof required to find Grippon guilty.Â  Id.Â  The Grippon majority went on to recommend the following charge in cases relying on circumstantial evidence:\r\n\r\n  There are two types of evidence which are generally presented during a trial--direct evidence and circumstantial evidence.Â  Direct evidence is the testimony of a person who asserts or claims to have actual knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness.Â  Circumstantial evidence is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating the existence of a fact.Â  The law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence.Â  Nor is a greater degree of certainty required of circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence.Â  You should weigh all the evidence in the case.Â  After weighing all the evidence, if you are not convinced of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find [the defendant] not guilty.\r\n\r\n327 S.C. at 83-84, 489 S.E.2d at 464.[10]Â  \r\nSince Grippon was decided, several opinions of this Court have appeared to retain the traditional Edwards circumstantial evidence charge as an alternative to the charge recommended in Grippon.Â  See State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 548 S.E.2d 210 (2001) (upholding charge which was a hybrid of the traditional charge and that recommended by Grippon); State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 156, 508 S.E.2d 857, 868, n. 13 (1999) (noting there are two appropriate ways to charge circumstantial evidence).Â  See also Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 338, 534 S.E.2d 672, 681, n.6 (2000) (noting that the traditional circumstantial evidence charge requires greater scrutiny than direct evidence in a criminal proceeding).Â  \r\nIt is patent from our decision in Grippon that the Edwards charge is no longer a required instruction.Â  However, we must decide whether the Edwards charge may be given as an alternative to a Grippon charge, or whether the language recommended in Grippon is the sole remaining instruction in a circumstantial evidence case.Â  We hold that Grippon is the sole remaining charge to be utilized by the courts of this state in instructing juries in cases relying, in whole or in part, on circumstantial evidence.Â Â  \r\nThe first American case adopting the â€œto the exclusion of every reasonable hypothesisâ€ standard was Commonwealth v. Webster, 59 Mass. (5 Cush.) 295 (1850).Â  However, from its outset, critics challenged the â€œreasonable hypothesisâ€ circumstantial evidence charge on the ground that circumstantial evidence should be treated no differently than direct evidence.Â  See Irene Rosenberg and Yale Rosenberg, â€œPerhaps What Ye Say Is Based Only on Conjectureâ€â€”Circumstantial Evidence Then and Now, 31 Hous. L. Rev. 1371, 1392, nn. 79-80 (1995) (hereinafter Rosenberg article) at p. 1392, nn. 79-80.Â  \r\nUltimately, the United States Supreme Court, in Holland v. United States, supra, held there was no difference between direct and circumstantial evidence, and that consequently in federal court there was no requirement the trial judge charge the jury that the evidence must be such as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis but that of guilt. Â Justice Clark reasoned that if the jury was properly instructed on the standards for reasonable doubt, a circumstantial evidence instruction was &quot;confusing and incorrect.&quot; Â 348 U.S. at 139-140.Â  \r\nAll of the federal courts, and the vast majority of state courts have adopted the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s approach in Holland.Â  See Rosenberg at nn. 121-122.[11]Â  A number of the state court decisions offer persuasive reasoning for abandoning the â€œreasonable hypothesisâ€ circumstantial evidence charge.\r\nIn State v. Adcock, 310 S.E.2d 587, 602-608 (N.C. 1983), the defendant objected to the trial courtâ€™s failure to instruct the jury that in order to justify a verdict of guilty, the circumstantial evidence must &quot;exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.â€Â  The North Carolina Supreme Court agreed that the evidence must indeed exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence but held that: \r\n\r\n  after all, the convincing effect of circumstantial evidence on the mind of the jury is measured by the same standard of intensity required of any other evidence--the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt as to every element of the crime before they find the defendant guilty of it, whether the evidence is wholly circumstantial, only partly so, or entirely what we sometimes refer to as direct. No set formula is required to convey to the jury this fixed principle relating to the degree of proof required for conviction.Â  The instruction adopts the formula most often used and to which we sooner or later all refer--proof beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  \r\n\r\nCiting Judge Learned Hand, the Adcock Court went on:\r\n\r\n  The judge failed to charge the jury as to circumstantial evidence, contenting himself with an entirely neutral statement of the opposed contentions of the parties, though he had been asked to say that such evidence was enough only when it foreclosed the hypothesis of innocence. He had with ample elaboration told them that they must be satisfied beyond fair doubt of the defendant's guilt, and that in our judgment was enough, though some courts have held otherwise.Â  The requirement seems to us a refinement which only serves to confuse laymen into supposing that they should use circumstantial evidence otherwise than testimonial. All conclusions have implicit major premises drawn from common knowledge; the truth of testimony depends as much upon these as do inferences from events. A jury tests a witness's credibility by using their experience in the past as to similar utterances of persons in a like position. That is precisely the same mental process as when they infer from an object what has been its past history, or from an event what must have preceded it. All that can be asked is that the importance of the result to the accused shall demand a corresponding certainty of his guilt; and this is commonly and adequately covered by telling them that the conclusion shall be free from fair doubt. To elaborate this into an inexorable ritual, or to articulate it for different situations, is more likely to impede, than to promote, their inquiry. \r\n\r\n301 N.C at 34-35, 310 S.E.2d at 606-607, citing United States v. Becker, 62 F.2d 1007, 1010 (2nd Cir. 1933) (emphasis supplied). \r\nThe Vermont Supreme Court has also noted that the â€œexclusion of every reasonable hypothesis of innocence&quot; standard is simply a method for evaluating whether the reasonable doubt standard has been met.Â  State v. Derouchie, 440 A.2d 146, 149 (Vt. 1981).[12]Â  Derouchie noted other criticisms of the â€œreasonable hypothesisâ€ standard: â€œfirst, as a device for judicial evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence, the â€˜exclusion of every reasonable hypothesis of innocenceâ€™ test is premised upon a now suspect distrust of circumstantial evidence. . . . Second, . . . [r]ather than assisting jurors in applying the reasonable doubt standard, the traditional circumstantial evidence charge has been condemned for having the opposite effect. By directing juror's attention to an additional, yet unnecessary, level of analysis, the circumstantial evidence charge serves only to confuse the real issue.â€Â  Id.Â  (emphasis supplied).\r\nThe Ohio Supreme Court has also addressed the continued validity of the charge, stating â€œ[t]he underlying rationale for the requirement that a circumstantial-evidence instruction should be given is predicated upon the assumption that circumstantial evidence is inherently suspicious and less trustworthy than is direct evidence.Â  It is assumed that the multiple-hypothesis instruction is desirable in order to guard against an improper reliance and use by the jury of tenuous circumstantial evidence.â€Â  State v. Jenks, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), superseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds, State v. Smith, 684 N.E.2d 668 (Ohio l997), cert denied, 523 U.S. 1125 (1998).Â  Jenks went on to hold:\r\n\r\n  It is simply untenable to assume that circumstantial evidence is less reliable than is direct evidence. In short, whether direct evidence or circumstantial evidence is more trustworthy and probative depends upon the particular facts of the case and no generalizations realistically can be made that one class of evidence is per se more reliable than is the other class of evidence. Obviously, since circumstantial evidence is not per se less reliable than is direct evidence, there is no need to give the multiple-hypothesis instruction when circumstantial evidence is involved.Â  In addition, we think the instruction is essentially a convoluted one, the main effect of which is to confuse the jury, possibly implying that a higher standard than reasonable doubt is necessary to render a verdict of guilty when circumstantial evidence is employed.\r\n\r\n574 N.E.2d at 501, citing State v. Gosby, 539 P.2d 680 (Wash. 1975) (emphasis supplied).Â  The West Virginia Supreme Court has similarly stated:\r\n\r\n  Circumstantial evidence and direct evidence inherently possess the same probative value. In some instances certain facts can only be established by circumstantial evidence. Hence, we can discern no reason to continue the requirement that circumstantial evidence must be irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of an accused's innocence in order to support a finding of guilt. We agree with those courts that have held that an additional instruction on the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence invites confusion and is unwarranted.Â  Since circumstantial evidence and direct evidence are indistinguishable so far as the jury's fact-finding function is concerned, all that is required of the jury is that it weigh all of the evidence, direct and circumstantial, against the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Nothing more should be required of a factfinder. \r\n\r\nState v. Guthrie, 461 S.E.2d 163, 175 (W. Va. 1995).Â  See also State v. Humpherys, 8 P.3d 652 (Idaho 2000)(holding that in all criminal cases there should be only one standard of proof, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, once the jury has been properly instructed on the reasonable doubt standard of proof, the defendant is not entitled to an additional instruction on circumstantial evidence even when all the evidence is circumstantial); State v. Ferm, 7 P.3d 193 (Haw. Ct App. 2000).\r\nWe are persuaded by the authorities highlighted above that the reasonable hypothesis charge merely serves to confuse juries by leading them to believe that the standard for measuring circumstantial evidence is different than that for measuring direct evidence when, in fact, it is not.[13]Â  The standard remains whether the evidence reflects proof of the defendantâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the recommended language in Grippon is the sole and exclusive charge to be given in circumstantial evidence cases in this state,[14] along with a proper reasonable doubt instruction.Â  The opinion of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in result only.[15]\r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT ONLY.\r\nMOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which Acting Justice Reginald I. Lloyd concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  The majority holds that the jury charge recommended in State v. Grippon is the sole and exclusive charge to be given in cases relying, in whole or in part, on circumstantial evidence.Â  Because I believe that South Carolina courts should not abandon the traditional circumstantial evidence charge described in State v. Edwards, I dissent.\r\nThe traditional circumstantial evidence charge provides that when the State relies on circumstantial evidence to prove its case, a jury may not convict the defendant unless â€œevery circumstance relied upon by the State [has been] proven beyond a reasonable doubt,â€ and â€œall of the circumstances so proven [are] consistent with each other and, taken together, point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.â€Â  State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 895 (1989) (citing State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924 (1955)) (emphasis added).Â  This charge is well established in South Carolina.Â  E.g., Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 338 n. 6, 534 S.E.2d 672, 681 n. 6 (2000); State v. Owens, 291 S.C. 116, 352 S.E.2d 474 (1987); State v. McIver, 238 S.C. 401, 120 S.E.2d 393 (1961); State v. Dornberg, 192 S.C. 513, 7 S.E.2d 467 (1940).\r\nRecently, in State v. Grippon, this Court approved another charge that may be given instead of the traditional circumstantial evidence charge.[16]Â  327 S.C. 79, 83-84, 489 S.E.2d 462, 464 (1997).Â  The charge recommended in Grippon emphasizes that direct and circumstantial evidence are to be given the same weight.Â  More importantly, the charge does not require, as does the traditional charge, that the circumstances â€œpoint conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.â€Â  Consequently, the Grippon charge leads jurors to believe, in my view, that direct and circumstantial evidence are to be evaluated in the very same manner.Â  Because I disapproved of the new charge, I wrote a separate, concurring opinion.Â  Id. at 84, 489 S.E.2d at 464.Â Â  \r\nToday, the Court holds that once a proper reasonable doubt instruction has been given, the charge recommended in Grippon is the sole remaining charge to be given in circumstantial evidence cases.Â  In support of its holding, the majority finds that the traditional circumstantial evidence charge confuses jurors â€œby leading them to believe that the standard for measuring circumstantial evidence is different than that for measuring direct evidence.â€Â  Because I continue to disapprove of the Grippon charge, I write separately once again, this time in dissent.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIt is clear that circumstantial and direct evidence may be â€œequally valid and convincingâ€ in a criminal case.Â  Moriarty, 341 S.C. at 338 n. 6, 534 S.E.2d at 681 n. 6.Â  But unlike direct evidence, circumstantial evidence establishes collateral facts from which the main facts may be inferred.Â  State v. Salisbury, 343 S.C. 520, 525 n. 1, 541 S.E.2d 247, 249 n. 1 (2001) (citations omitted).Â  The evaluation of circumstantial evidence, therefore, requires jurors to connect collateral facts in order to reach a conclusionâ€”a process not required when evaluating direct evidence.Â  \r\nThe traditional circumstantial evidence charge does not, in my view, create confusion or change the standard for measuring circumstantial evidence.Â  Instead, the charge clarifies the juryâ€™s responsibility to evaluate circumstantial evidence carefully and gives jurors more detailed information about the relation of circumstantial evidence to the determination of guilt.Â  Moreover, the standard for evaluating evidence remains unchanged: every circumstance must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Therefore, in my view, the Edwards charge should be retained.Â  \r\nThe Grippon charge, on the other hand, does nothing to alert the jury to this separate and distinct analytical framework.Â  This lack of instruction may have unintended, dangerous consequences.Â  Juries may make logical leaps when putting evidence together, and in doing so, may reach illogical conclusions based on emotion or intuition instead of a rational, deliberative process.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the State relied on the following evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Cherry was guilty of PWID:Â  Cherry was a passenger in a car that was in a high crime area â€œknown for drugsâ€; Cherry was carrying eight rocks of crack cocaine and $322.00, most of which was in twenty-dollar bills; and no drug paraphernalia were found in the car.Â  Because the evidence of â€œintent to distributeâ€ was purely circumstantial, Cherry requested that the trial judge charge the jury with the traditional circumstantial evidence charge.Â Â  \r\nAlthough it is inferable that Cherry intended to distribute crack cocaine, it is equally as inferable, in my view, he did not.Â  Possessing drugs in a high crime area â€œknown for drugsâ€ does not automatically make one a drug dealer.Â  It is also reasonable that $322 in cash would be comprised of mostly twenty-dollar bills.Â  Moreover, it is reasonable to conclude that because Cherry did not have the requisite amount of crack cocaine on him to give rise to a permissive inference of distribution, he did not intend to distribute crack cocaine.Â  Finally, that there were no drug paraphernalia in the car may or may not establish that Cherry was carrying the crack for his personal use.Â  \r\nIn sum, there is no direct evidence that Cherry intended to distribute crack cocaine.Â  Therefore, even if each circumstance were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, jurors must still ask themselves, under the Edwards charge, whether there is any other reasonable conclusion other than guilt.Â  Without this instruction, the jury does not know that this critical step in the reasoning process exists.Â  In fact, the jury is without an analytical framework in which to evaluate the evidence.Â  That the circumstances could lead a juror to make reasonable inferences either way highlights the importance of retaining the Edwards charge.Â Â Â  \r\nI recognize, as I did in my Grippon concurrence, that a majority of states have abandoned the circumstantial evidence charge in favor of an approach that does not differentiate between direct and circumstantial evidence and simply provides that a defendantâ€™s guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  See Irene Merker Rosenberg &amp; Yale L. Rosenberg, â€œPerhaps What Ye Say Is Based Only on Conjectureâ€â€”Circumstantial Evidence Then and Now, 31 Hous. L. Rev. 1371, 1400 (1995) (describing the abandonment of the circumstantial evidence charge as a â€œbandwagon effectâ€ in response to the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121 (1954), rather than a reasoned rejection of the longstanding charge).Â  But several states have continued to require the special charge when the Stateâ€™s case is based wholly or substantially on circumstantial evidence.[17]Â  E.g., Stubbs v. State, 463 S.E.2d 686 (Ga. 1995); Nichols v. State, 591 N.E.2d 134 (Ind. 1992); People v. Ford, 488 N.E.2d 458 (N.Y. 1985); People v. Towler, 641 P.2d 1253 (Cal. 1982).Â  Further, some states have advanced cogent reasons for retaining the charge.Â  See, e.g., Ford, 488 N.E.2d at 465 (retaining the charge because it emphasizes the need for careful reasoning and â€œforecloses [the] danger â€¦ that the trier of facts may leap logical gaps in the proof offered and draw unwarranted conclusion based on probabilities of low degreeâ€); State v. Nelson, 731 P.2d 788 (Idaho Ct. App. 1986), affâ€™d, 756 P.2d 409 (Idaho 1998) (rejecting the argument that the â€œreasonable hypothesisâ€ language confused jurors and concluding that the language gave â€œsharpened clarityâ€ to the meaning of reasonable doubt).Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn my view, the charge advanced today as the sole and exclusive charge to be \r\n  given in circumstantial evidence cases does nothing to direct the juryâ€™s deliberative \r\n  process.Â  By omitting the â€œreasonable hypothesisâ€ language, this Court leaves \r\n  open the possibility that even when a reasonable theory exists supporting a \r\n  defendantâ€™s innocence, a (possibly erroneous) conviction will stand.Â  \r\nTherefore, in my view, the trial judge erred in not granting Cherryâ€™s request that the jury be given the Edwards charge. \r\nActing Justice Reginald I. Lloyd, concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] He was also indicted for possession of crack within proximity of a park.Â  The trial judge directed a verdict for Cherry on this count.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The total weight of the crack was .9 grams, one-tenth gram short of the amount required to give rise to a permissive inference of distribution.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (B) (Supp. 2002)(possession of one or more grams of crack cocaine is prima facie evidence of a violation of the PWID statute).Â Â  However, a conviction of PWID does not hinge upon the amount involved.Â  State v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 352 S.E.2d 483 (1987); State v. Simpson, 275 S.C. 426, 272 S.E.2d 431 (1980), cert. denied 451 U.S. 911 (1981).\r\n[3]Â  The trial court also gave a very thorough â€œreasonable doubtâ€ charge.Â  \r\n[4]Â  See State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 895 (1989); State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1955); Tom J. Ervin, Ervin's South Carolina Requests to Charge-Criminal Â§ 3-4 (1994).\r\n[5]Â  State v. Cherry, 353 S.C. 263, 577 S.E.2d 719 (2001).\r\n[6]Â Â  Judges Hearn and Cureton concurred in Judge Howardâ€™s opinion; Judge Connor wrote separately and concurred in part with Judge Howardâ€™s opinion, and concurred in part with Judge Shulerâ€™s opinion.\r\n[7]Â Â  Judge Connor was the only member of the panel who would have reversed on both issues.Â  \r\n[8]Â  In State v. Robinson, 344 S.C. 220, 543 S.E.2d 249 (2001), the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the defendantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the offense of PWID crack where the evidence at trial revealed police observed the defendant throw a plastic bag up in the air, which contained seven rocks of crack cocaine, having a total weight of .9 grams.Â  There was no evidence the defendant had an excess amount of cash, or twenty dollar bills on his person, no evidence of any other drug paraphernalia, and no testimony as to the amount each rock of crack would sell for.Â  The sole testimony relied upon by the Court of Appeals panel in that case was testimony of police officers that it is not typical for a simple user of crack cocaine to possess seven rocks of crack at one time, and that they typically possess only one or two rocks.Â  344 S.C. atÂ  223, 543 S.E.2d at 250.\r\n[9]Â Â  In State v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 417, 409 S.E.2d 372, 374 (1991), we held that a circumstantial evidence charge which requires the jury to seek some reasonable explanation other than the defendantâ€™s guilt â€œturns the State's burden of proof on its head by requiring the jury to find a â€˜reasonable explanationâ€™ of the evidence inconsistent with appellant's guilt before it can find him not guilty.â€Â Â  \r\n[10]Â Â  Justice Toal, joined by Justice Finney, concurred in result only.Â  Although they agreed that Gripponâ€™s conviction should be affirmed, they saw no need to discontinue use of the standard Edwards circumstantial evidence charge.Â  \r\n[11]Â  For a list of states adopting the Holland approach, see Hankins v. State, 646 S.W.2d 191, 197-198 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983)(op. on rehâ€™g).Â  See also Carroll J.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n[13]Â  We are not unmindful that there are arguments, as pointed out by Chief Justice Toalâ€™s dissent, which may be advanced in favor of retention of the traditional Edwards circumstantial evidence charge, and some jurisdictions have chosen to adhere to the â€œexclusion of any reasonably hypothesisâ€ instruction.Â  However, these same arguments were advanced by the concurrence in State v. Grippon, supra, and theÂ  majority of this Court declined, at that time, to join the concurrence.Â  See Grippon, supra, 327 S.C. at 84-89, 489 S.E.2d at 464-467 (Justice Toal, concurring in result only).Â  \r\n[14]Â  To the extent our opinions in Grippon, supra; State v. Graddick, supra; State v. Needs, supra and Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, supra, are inconsistent with this holding, they are modified.\r\n[15]Â  In light of our holding, we need not address Cherryâ€™s remaining argument concerning the effect of the Court of Appealsâ€™ divided opinions.\r\n[16] Although a new charge was recommended, the Court did not overrule the traditional circumstantial evidence charge.Â  State v.
