Richardson, Jr. and James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nJohn J. McKay, Jr., of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the issuance of an admonition or a public \r\n  reprimand.  We accept the agreement and find a public reprimand is the appropriate \r\n  sanction.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nBright Acres Associates was a partnership consisting of \r\n  the following four equal partners:  John Leutwiler, Henry Massey, John Brainard, \r\n  and Leo Zabinski.  The partnership was created in 1980 in order to buy, renovate, \r\n  and sell thirty apartments and approximately twenty-six acres of land on Hilton \r\n  Head Island.  Respondent prepared the partnership agreement, which expressly \r\n  provided for arbitration of all controversies or claims arising out of the partnership \r\n  agreement.  However, notice of the arbitration clause was not typed in underlined \r\n  capital letters or rubber-stamped prominently on the face of the partnership \r\n  agreement as required by the South Carolina Arbitration Act, S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-48-10(a) (Supp. 2002).  See Zabinski v. Bright Acres Associates, \r\n  346 S.C. 580, 553 S.E.2d 110 (2001).\r\nRespondent represented the partnership, or individual partners, \r\n  between 1980 and 1991, in matters involving (1) the acquisition of property, \r\n  (2) Brainard's assignment of his interest to his children, and (3) Massey's \r\n  agreement to purchase Leutwiler's 25% interest in Bright Acres.  Respondent \r\n  prepared the Massey/Leutwiler agreement.\r\nIn 1990, Leutwiler sued Massey over a dispute concerning \r\n  the obligations, terms, and conditions of the sale document respondent had drafted \r\n  for Leutwiler.  Respondent represented Leutwiler (and later, Leutwiler's Estate) \r\n  in this suit, and that litigation continued for over ten years.  Respondent \r\n  failed to disclose his involvement to Massey and obtain Massey's consent prior \r\n  to commencing the litigation on behalf of Leutwiler.\r\nIn 1998, Zabinski and Brainard brought an action against \r\n  Bright Acres, Massey and the Leutwiler Estate to compel arbitration pursuant \r\n  to the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement.  Respondent filed an \r\n  answer, counterclaim, cross-claim and third-party complaint on behalf of the \r\n  Leutwiler Estate claiming the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement \r\n  he prepared was not valid under section 15-48-10.  At no time did respondent \r\n  consult Zabinski, Brainard or Massey about conflicts of interest arising from \r\n  his representation of the Leutwiler Estate nor did he obtain their consent to \r\n  proceed against them.\r\nWhen it became apparent respondent would be required to \r\n  testify in the trial of the matter both as a witness to some events and as a \r\n  party-defendant to others, he failed to withdraw from representation of the \r\n  Leutwiler Estate.  On September 21, 2000, an order was issued disqualifying \r\n  respondent from further participation as attorney for the Leutwiler Estate.  \r\n  That order was affirmed by this Court.  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Associates, \r\n  Op. No. 2001-MO-050 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed September 4, 2001).\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall \r\n  provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2(c) (a lawyer may limit \r\n  the objectives of the representation if the client consents after consultation); \r\n  Rule 1.2(e) (when a lawyer knows a client expects assistance not permitted by \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct, the lawyer shall consult with the client \r\n  regarding relevant limitations on the lawyer's conduct); Rule 1.7 (a lawyer \r\n  shall not represent a client if the representation of that client is directly \r\n  adverse to another client or it may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities \r\n  to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer's own interests); Rule \r\n  1.8(b) (a lawyer shall not use information relating to representation of a client \r\n  to the disadvantage of the client unless the client consents after consultation); \r\n  Rule 1.9(a) (a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall \r\n  not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related \r\n  matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests \r\n  of the former client unless the former client consents after consultation); \r\n  Rule 1.9(c) (a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall \r\n  not thereafter use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage \r\n  of the former client); Rule 3.7 (a lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial \r\n  in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness); Rule 8.4(a) (it is \r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute \r\n  the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession \r\n  into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law) .\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction \r\n  in this case.  We do so after considering the mitigating circumstances, including \r\n  respondent's belief that his involvement in representing the partnership itself \r\n  was so limited as to not create a conflict, his efforts to find substitute counsel \r\n  for the Leutwiler Estate after determining there was a conflict, and his reluctance \r\n  to abandon his client, as well as the fact that the litigation at issue did \r\n  have some legitimate basis.  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his actions. \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25590","title":"Hooks v.

Hooks (â€œHooksâ€) \r\n  petition for certiorari from denial of his post-conviction relief (â€œPCRâ€) and \r\n  now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nHooks was indicted for murder, accessory after the \r\n  fact of murder, accessory after the fact of assault and battery with intent \r\n  to kill, distribution of marijuana and distribution of marijuana within proximity \r\n  to a school.  He pled guilty to accessory after the fact of murder and distribution \r\n  of marijuana.  The court sentenced Hooks to concurrent terms of imprisonment \r\n  of fifteen years for accessory and five years for distribution.\r\nIn his petition for certiorari Hooks alleges, for the \r\n  first time [1] , the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of his \r\n  accessory plea because the indictment omitted essential elements of the offense.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDid the trial court lack subject matter jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea \r\n  because the indictment was insufficient?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did Hooks waive his right to object to the sufficiency of the indictment by \r\n  not complying with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (1985)?\r\n\r\nI\r\nSufficiency of the Indictment\r\nA circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and may not\r\naccept a guilty plea if the indictment does not sufficiently state the offense. \r\n  [2]   Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995).  We \r\n  judge the sufficiency of an indictment against whether it contains the necessary \r\n  elements of the offense to be charged and whether it sufficiently appraises \r\n  the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.  State v. Adams, 277 \r\n  S.C. 115, 125, 283 S.E.2d 582, 587 (1981), overruled on other \r\n  grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45 , 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).  \r\n  We do not judge an indictmentâ€™s sufficiency based upon inquiring whether it \r\n  could be more definite or certain.  State v. Ham, 259 S.C. 118, 129, \r\n  191 S.E.2d 13, 17 (1972) \r\nAt the time of Hooksâ€™s plea, the crime of accessory after the fact \r\n  to murder contained the following elements:  1) the felony had been completed; \r\n  2) the accused had knowledge that the principal committed the felony; 3) the \r\n  accused harbored or assisted the principal; and 4) the accused was not present \r\n  at the scene of the crime.  State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  202 (1998). [3]   The indictment presented to Hooks read: \r\n\r\nThat Wayne Christopher Hooks did in Florence County on or \r\n  about January 28, 1995, render assistance to a felon, namely, Marcel Andre Ervin, \r\n  who, on or about January 28, 1995, committed the crime of murder of James Jonathan \r\n  Brown.\r\n\r\nR.p. 91.  \r\nThe State argues the indictment is sufficient to put Hooks on notice of the \r\n  charges pending against him although it fails to allege he knew the principal \r\n  committed murder or that he was not present at the crime scene.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nThe knowledge element is critical because the State bears the burden of proving \r\n  Hooksâ€™s assistance was for the purpose of enabling the principal to avoid detection \r\n  or arrest.  State v. Legette, 285 S.C. 465, 330 S.E.2d 293 (1985).   \r\n  Such assistance is only illegal if Hooks had knowledge of the principalâ€™s prior \r\n  actions.  Unless the State can prove Hooks knew he was helping a murderer avoid \r\n  arrest he could not be guilty of accessory after the fact of murder.         \r\nAn argument may be made, however, that the indictmentâ€™s inclusion of the word \r\n  â€œfelonâ€ to describe Ervin along with the verb â€œmurderâ€ to describe Ervinâ€™s action \r\n  is sufficient to notify Hooks that he was charged with helping a felon who had \r\n  murdered someone.  The two words viewed in the context of the entire sentence \r\n  may allow for such a reading.  However, even if we were to accept such a reading, \r\n  the indictment is deficient because it did not specify Hooks was not present \r\n  at the scene of the crime.\r\nThe presence element is critical in the pre-Collins context.  Prior \r\n  to our decision in Collins a person who was with the principal at the \r\n  scene of the crime would himself be a principal to the crime and not an accessory.  \r\n  State v. Whitted, 279 S.C. 260, 305 S.E.2d 245 (1983), overruled \r\n  by Collins, supra.  Hooks pled guilty prior to the Collins \r\n  decision, therefore, the State was required to prove he was not at the scene \r\n  when the crime occurred in order to be guilty of accessory after the fact of \r\n  murder.\r\nPre-Collins case law required \r\n  the indictment inform Hooks of the presence element.  The omission of this element \r\n  renders the indictment insufficient. \r\nII\r\nWaiver of Objection\r\nThe State argues Hooks waived \r\n  his right to object to the sufficiency of the indictment by failing to comply \r\n  with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (1985).  We disagree.\r\nThis statute provides:  â€œEvery objection to any indictment for any \r\n  defect apparent on the face thereof shall be taken by demurrer or on motion \r\n  to quash such indictment before the jury shall be sworn and not afterwards.â€  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (1985).  The statute applies to guilty pleas as well \r\n  as those actions tried by jury.  State v. Phillips, 215 S.C. 314, 54 \r\n  S.E.2d 901 (1949).\r\nIt is settled, however, that lack of subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental \r\n  and may not be waived even by consent of the parties.  Brown v. State, \r\n  343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001).  A judgment by a court cannot be affirmed \r\n  where the court had no right to act.  The actions and judgment of the court \r\n  in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction are void.  Id.; see \r\n  also, State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 519 S.E.2d 793 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999) (general rule that lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at \r\n  anytime supercedes S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90).  The State concedes in brief, \r\n  and case law suggests, the statute applies to only non-jurisdictional defects \r\n  in the indictment.  See State v. Mitchum, 258 S.C. 52, 187 S.E.2d \r\n  240 (1972); State v. Lewis, 321 S.C. 146, 467 S.E.2d 265 (Ct. App. 1996).  \r\n  Here the lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a jurisdictional defect not \r\n  covered by the statute.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly we REVERSE the PCR courtâ€™s dismissal of Hooksâ€™s \r\n  petition and vacate the portion of his guilty plea for accessory after the fact \r\n  of murder.\r\n TOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We may review this case although Hooks failed \r\n    to raise the indictment issue until his petition for certiorari to this Court.  \r\n    See Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001) (subject \r\n    matter jurisdiction may be raised at anytime).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]    Two exceptions apply to the general rule that \r\n    an indictment must sufficiently state the offense to confer jurisdiction on \r\n    a court.  The first applies if the defendant waives presentment.  The second \r\n    applies where the charge to which the defendant pleads guilty is a lesser-included  \r\n    offense of the crime charged in the indictment.  See Browning v. \r\n    State, 320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995).  Nothing in the record indicates \r\n    Hooks waived presentment of the indictment.  Further, accessory after the \r\n    fact of murder is not a lesser-included offense of the charge of murder for \r\n    which Hooks was indicted.  See State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, \r\n    495 S.E.2d 202 (1998).  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] We held in Collins that the absence of \r\n    the accused from the scene of the crime would no longer be an element of accessory \r\n    after the fact and declined  to apply the new rule retroactively.  For purposes \r\n    of this case the absence prong is an element of accessory after the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25591","title":"State v.

Bailey, Jr., of Summerville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  Appellant was convicted of three counts \r\n  of murder and first degree burglary.  He was sentenced to death for the murders \r\n  and life imprisonment for burglary.  We affirm.  \r\nGUILT PHASE [1] \r\nDuring his opening statement, \r\n  defense counsel admitted appellant killed Linda Williams, her thirteen year \r\n  old daughter Stacy, and Lindaâ€™s mother, Dorothy Gates.  He stated appellant \r\n  had tried to cope with a complicated relationship but â€œsnapped.â€\r\nEvidence indicated appellant lived with Linda for two years.  On September \r\n  3, 1999, Linda asked appellant to move out of her home.  The following day, \r\n  the police were summoned to Lindaâ€™s home and a deputy told appellant to leave.  \r\n  Over the next day or two, appellant telephoned Lindaâ€™s home numerous times and \r\n  left threatening messages on her answering machine.  In one message, he stated:  \r\n  â€œyou can run, and you can hide, but you canâ€™t go on forever, because Charles \r\n  is coming for your  g___d___ ass.  Because you, Linda Gates, Dot Gates, Terry \r\n  Gates, Lori Gates, and all you m_____f____, because I am coming for you!  \r\n  I am coming for you.  You know what I mean? . . .â€.  (italic in original).\r\nOn September 6th, a police officer was again dispatched to Lindaâ€™s \r\n  home.  While listening to the answering machine tapes, the telephone rang.  \r\n  The officer answered the telephone; appellant stated, â€œ[p]ut that whore on the \r\n  phone.  She owes me $40,000.â€  The officer told appellant not to call again \r\n  and appellant responded, â€œIâ€™ll see her later.â€  \r\nBuster, Lindaâ€™s nine-year-old son testified that \r\n  around 7:00 p.m. on September 8, 1999, he saw appellantâ€™s car circle the block \r\n  three times before driving into his yard.  Appellant exited the vehicle carrying \r\n  a â€œlong gunâ€ and â€œbusted throughâ€ a front window of Busterâ€™s home.  Buster testified \r\n  he ran inside and heard appellant tell his mother â€œput the mother f___ phone \r\n  downâ€  and â€œI got you now, you bitch.â€  While running to his neighborâ€™s home, \r\n  Buster heard a shot.  \r\nOver appellantâ€™s objection, the State played a redacted tape recording \r\n  of several 911 calls. [2]   Screaming \r\n  and three gunshots are heard on the first call.  The 911 operator states, â€œweâ€™ve \r\n  been going to this house all weekend.â€ \r\n  [3]   During another call, a neighbor states her neighborâ€™s child had come \r\n  over and reported his motherâ€™s boyfriend was trying to kill his mother.  On \r\n  the last call, Stacy states five people have been shot by appellant.  In response \r\n  to a question from the operator, Stacy says she cannot feel below her waist \r\n  and does not know where she has been shot.  \r\nSheriffâ€™s Department officers arrived at Lindaâ€™s home.  Linda, Stacy, \r\n  and Dorothy had been shot.  Appellant had also been shot. [4]   Initially, Linda appeared to \r\n  be alive.  Stacy, wounded in the back, was moving on the living room floor; \r\n  she inquired about her brother.  She stated â€œCharlesâ€ had shot them.  Dorothy \r\n  was dead.  \r\nAppellant was lying on the floor in the hallway.  An officer testified a shotgun \r\n  lay beside him; appellantâ€™s finger was in the trigger release.  Appellant stated, \r\n  â€œF___  them.  F___ them all.  Let them die.â€  The officer took the shotgun from \r\n  appellant and removed a live shell. \r\n  [5]   Another officer stated appellant stated â€œKill me.  Finish me off.  \r\n  Finish the job.â€  \r\nA paramedic testified Stacy \r\n  asked about her brother and begged not to let her die.  She stated she was having \r\n  trouble breathing.  The paramedic estimated Stacy died within ten minutes of \r\n  his arrival. \r\nA detention center nurse \r\n  testified, while arguing over who would receive medical treatment first, appellant \r\n  told another inmate, â€œ. . . Iâ€™ve killed three people and donâ€™t mind making it \r\n  four.â€  A detention center officer stated, on the one year anniversary of the \r\n  shootings, appellant pointed to the newspaper picture of Dorothy and stated, \r\n  either â€œI killed this witchâ€ or â€œI killed this bitchâ€ and referred to her as \r\n  the devil.  He stated he loved Linda and Stacy.  \r\nPENALTY PHASE\r\nAt the beginning of the three-day sentencing proceeding, \r\n  appellant moved to exclude the admission of the unredacted 911 tape, arguing \r\n  the tapeâ€™s probative value did not outweigh its prejudicial impact.  The trial \r\n  judge overruled the objection, concluding the tape, while â€œextremely prejudicial,â€ \r\n  was relevant to the aggravating circumstance of torture. \r\n  [6]   \r\nAfter the State played a portion of the 911 tape, \r\n  Stacyâ€™s father identified the scream on the tape as belonging to his daughter.  \r\n  Thereafter, the State played the tape in its entirety.  In addition to identifying \r\n  appellant as the shooter, the tape contains several minutes of Stacyâ€™s conversation \r\n  with the 911 dispatchers.  Stacyâ€™s breathing is labored and she has difficulty \r\n  speaking.  Several times, Stacy states â€œIâ€™m hurtingâ€ and â€œplease hurry.â€  Her \r\n  pain and suffering are evident.  \r\nAppellant offered several witnesses in mitigation.  An expert \r\n  in clinical social work testified appellant lacked socialization skills, was \r\n  emotionally immature, dependent on relationships, and that chronic alcohol problems \r\n  ran in his family.  An expert in psychopharmacology testified appellant suffered \r\n  from chronic depression, anxiety, and alcohol dependency.  He suggested alcohol \r\n  usage may have caused some brain damage. An expert in neurology testified appellantâ€™s \r\n  MRI revealed a loss of brain tissue.   \r\nAn expert in psychiatry diagnosed appellant with depression, \r\n  possible post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the shootings, and possible \r\n  malingering.  An expert in forensic psychiatry diagnosed appellant with â€œadjustment \r\n  disorder with depressed moodâ€ as a result of the shootings.  \r\nDetention center witnesses testified appellant had not caused \r\n  any problems in jail while awaiting trial.  An expert in the field of prisons \r\n  and corrections testified appellant could be confined in a correctional environment \r\n  for the rest of his life without harm to himself or others.  \r\nAppellant did not testify.  He did not make a final statement \r\n  to the jury. [7]   \r\nDuring closing argument, the solicitor played a portion of \r\n  the 911 tape (apparently the beginning of the tape with screaming and gunshots).  \r\n  He later played all of the tape.    \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n  I.    Did the trial judge err by allowing the solicitor \r\n  to â€œexploitâ€ portions of the unredacted version of the 911 tape during the sentencing \r\n  proceeding?  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  During closing argument, did the \r\n  solicitor improperly comment on appellantâ€™s constitutional right not to testify? \r\n   \r\n  III. Did the solicitorâ€™s closing argument inject an arbitrary \r\n  factor into the juryâ€™s deliberations?  \r\n\r\nI.\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by allowing the solicitor \r\n  to â€œexploitâ€ that portion of the 911 tape which depicts Stacyâ€™s pain and suffering.  \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nRelevant evidence is defined as â€œevidence having any tendency \r\n  to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination \r\n  of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€  \r\n  Rule 401, SCRE.  Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative \r\n  value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE.  The relevance, materiality, and admissibility of evidence are matters \r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court and a ruling will be disturbed \r\n  only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.  State v. Rosemond, 335 \r\n  S.C. 593, 518 S.E.2d 588 (1999).   \r\nThe purpose of the sentencing phase in a capital trial is \r\n  to direct the juryâ€™s attention to the specific circumstances of the crime and \r\n  the characteristics of the offender.  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d 745 (2001).  Evidence which would ordinarily be inadmissible in the guilt \r\n  phase of trial may be introduced during the penalty phase.  State v. Kornahrens, \r\n  290 S.C. 281, 350 S.E.2d 180 (1986), cert. denied 480 U.S. 940 \r\n  (1987).   During the sentencing phase, the trial judge may permit the introduction \r\n  of additional evidence of aggravation in order to aid the jury in determining \r\n  whether to recommend a death sentence.  Id.   \r\nThe 911 tape was properly admitted as its probative value \r\n  outweighed its prejudicial nature for two reasons.  First, Stacyâ€™s recorded \r\n  statements were relevant as they describe the crime scene immediately after \r\n  she and her family were shot.  Like photographs which are generally admissible \r\n  in the penalty phase of a capital trial, Stacyâ€™s comments show the circumstances \r\n  of the crime and the character of the defendant.  Id. (in sentencing \r\n  proceeding, trial court may admit photographs which depict the bodies of the \r\n  murder victims in substantially the same condition in which the defendant left \r\n  them in order to show the circumstances of the crime and the character of the \r\n  defendant).    \r\nSecond, Stacyâ€™s apparent physical distress as revealed by \r\n  the tape was relevant to establish the aggravating circumstance of physical \r\n  torture. [8]   Even though the pathologist \r\n  described Stacyâ€™s gunshot wounds as painful, Stacyâ€™s own expression of her pain \r\n  and suffering more fully chronicles the last few minutes of her life.  See \r\n  State v. Rosemond, supra (use of photographs to corroborate pathologistâ€™s \r\n  testimony victim lived for ten minutes after shooting properly admissible in \r\n  penalty phase).  The 911 tape was properly admitted as it was relevant to the \r\n  aggravating circumstance of physical torture.  See State v. Johnson, \r\n  338 S.C. 114, 525 S.E.2d 519, cert. denied 531 U.S. 840 (2000) \r\n  (crime scene photographs relevant to physical torture); State v. Franklin, \r\n  318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 856 (photographs \r\n  admissible in penalty phase of capital proceeding as relevant to issue of physical \r\n  torture). \r\nFurthermore, the 911 tape was not so unfairly prejudicial \r\n  so as to substantially outweigh its probative value.  While difficult to hear, \r\n  Stacyâ€™s physical and emotional distress is not so disturbing as to suggest appellantâ€™s \r\n  sentence was made on an improper basis.  State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. \r\n  377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991) (unfair prejudice exists where evidence creates tendency \r\n  to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly though not necessarily, an \r\n  emotional one).\r\nFinally, the solicitor did not unduly exploit the 911 \r\n  tape during the penalty phase of trial.  We agree with appellant that excessive \r\n  use of an otherwise admissible exhibit could result in a denial of due process.  \r\n  See  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991) (â€œ[i]n the event \r\n  that evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the \r\n  trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \r\n  provides a mechanism for relief.â€).  Nevertheless, we conclude the use of the \r\n  911 tape during the penalty phase of appellantâ€™s trial did not result in a denial \r\n  of fundamental fairness.  During the three day proceeding, the prosecution played \r\n  an excerpt from the 911 tape for identification purposes \r\n  [9]  and the entire tape during the presentation of its evidence.  During \r\n  closing argument, the solicitor again played a portion of the 911 tape and the \r\n  entire tape.  Under the circumstances, the use of the 911 tape did not result \r\n  in a denial of due process.  \r\nII.\r\nAppellant argues the solicitor improperly commented on his \r\n  constitutional right not to testify during closing argument.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nDuring closing argument, the following transpired:\r\n\r\nSolicitor:  Iâ€™m going to go ahead and play [the answering \r\n  machine] tape [10]  again, and when you listen to that tape, I want you to think \r\n  about the circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the Defendant, \r\n  which is what you all will need to base your decision on.  \r\n[Played answering machine tape].\r\nSolicitor:  Where is the mitigation evidence in this \r\n  case?  Where is evidence that [appellant] has ever done one good deed or had \r\n  one decent thought?  \r\nDefense Counsel:  Your honor, I believe that is burden shifting.  \r\n  Heâ€™s starting to really - - -\r\nThe Court:  No, sir.  Iâ€™ll note your objection.  I overrule \r\n  it.  Thank you.  \r\n(Underline added).  \r\n\r\nIn part, the trial judge charged the jury as follows:  \r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, I tell you now, and I emphasize to \r\n  you again that the fact that the Defendant did not testify in this portion of \r\n  the trial of this case is not a factor to be considered by you in your deliberation \r\n  and in your consideration on the question of his sentence.  It must not be considered \r\n  by you in any way.  It must not mitigate [sic] against him in any respect because \r\n  the Defendant has a constitutional right to remain silent, and if he chooses \r\n  to assert that right, that fact cannot and must not be considered by you in \r\n  your deliberations; and so, please reach no inference and draw no conclusion \r\n  whatsoever from the fact that the Defendant did not testify in this portion \r\n  of the case.  That should not even be discussed by you.  The burden of proof \r\n  on issues that are in dispute, as I have told you, is upon the State, and the \r\n  Defendant has no obligation to take the stand or testify, and the fact that \r\n  he did not take the stand and testify is not a factor to be considered by you \r\n  in your decision in this case.  \r\n\r\nAppellantâ€™s argument that the solicitorâ€™s comment implicitly \r\n  referred to his constitutional right not to testify is not preserved for review.  \r\n  At trial, appellant claimed the solicitorâ€™s comment improperly shifted the burden \r\n  of proof; he now claims the comment improperly referred to his right to remain \r\n  silent.  Accordingly, whether the solicitorâ€™s comment improperly referred to \r\n  appellantâ€™s right to remain silent is not preserved for review.  State v. \r\n  Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) (a party cannot argue one basis \r\n  in support of motion at trial and another ground on appeal).\r\nIn any event, the solicitorâ€™s statement did not \r\n  refer to appellantâ€™s decision to remain silent.  Instead, the statement was \r\n  a comment on the evidence which had been presented by the prosecution -- appellantâ€™s \r\n  hateful and intimidating threats shortly before the murders  -- and the mitigating \r\n  evidence which had been presented by appellant.  Johnson v. State, 325 \r\n  S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997) (court considers context in which remark was \r\n  made).\r\nAssuming the comment did refer to appellantâ€™s decision \r\n  not to testify, the error was harmless.  While the State may not comment on \r\n  the defendantâ€™s right to remain silent, see Griffin v. California, \r\n  380 U.S. 609 (1965), an improper reference is subject to harmless error analysis.  \r\n  Edmond v. State, 341 S.C. 340, 534 S.E.2d 682 (2000). \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s instruction to the jury that it could \r\n  not consider appellantâ€™s failure to testify in any way and could not use it \r\n  against him cured any potential error.  Johnson v. State, supra \r\n  (even if comment on defendant's failure to testify was improper, trial courtâ€™s \r\n  instruction that jury could not consider defendantâ€™s failure to testify in any \r\n  way and could not use it against him was sufficient to cure any potential error); \r\n  State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d 195 (1978) (possibility jury \r\n  might have interpreted solicitorâ€™s comment as indicating Stateâ€™s evidence was \r\n  conclusive proof of defendantâ€™s guilt was negated by charge).  The lone remark \r\n  did not â€œso infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction \r\n  a denial of due process.â€  Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986), \r\n  citing Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 643 (1974).  \r\nIII.\r\nAppellant argues by telling jurors they \r\n  would be personally responsible for future murders if they did not sentence \r\n  him to death, the solicitor improperly diverted the juryâ€™s attention from consideration \r\n  of the circumstances of the crime and of his character and improperly injected \r\n  an arbitrary factor into its consideration.  We disagree.  \r\nThe following transpired during the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  closing argument:\r\n\r\nSolicitor:  We know that [appellant] \r\n  didnâ€™t snap.  We know that he planned this.  It was premeditated.  He thought \r\n  about it for days beforehand.  \r\nDefense Counsel:  Your honor, object to any arguments of \r\n  deterrence.\r\nThe Court:  Excuse me.  Iâ€™m sorry, the objection is to what?\r\nDefense Counsel:  I object to any argument that goes into \r\n  the line of deterrence, Your Honor.  \r\nThe Court:  I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to do to that.  Thatâ€™s \r\n  not where youâ€™re going with it.  \r\nDefense Counsel:  Yes, sir, Your Honor.\r\nThe Court:  All right, under the law heâ€™s allowed to argue \r\n  general deterrence, I think as I understand.  Thank you. \r\nSolicitor:  He thought about it before he did it.  If \r\n  you impose the death penalty on [appellant] maybe it will cause somebody else \r\n  thinking of murder not to do it, and you might spare an innocent life or save \r\n  a life.\r\n\r\n(Underline added).  \r\nAt the conclusion of the closing arguments, the \r\n  trial judge noted appellant objected to the Stateâ€™s reference to deterrence.  \r\n  The trial judge overruled the objection.     \r\nThe solicitorâ€™s comment was clearly an argument \r\n  on general deterrence.  General deterrence arguments are admissible in the penalty \r\n  phase of a capital trial.  See State v. Shafer, 340 S.C. 291, \r\n  531 S.E.2d 524 (2000), overruled on other grds. \r\n  532 U.S. 36 (2001).  The argument did not inject an arbitrary factor (fear or \r\n  personal responsibility) into the juryâ€™s consideration.  The solicitorâ€™s remark \r\n  did not â€œso infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction \r\n  a denial of due process.â€  Darden v. Wainwright, supra.\r\nPROPORTIONALITY \r\n  REVIEW\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude the death \r\n  sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, \r\n  and the juryâ€™s finding of statutory aggravating circumstances for each of the \r\n  three murders is supported by the evidence.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 \r\n  (1985).  Further, the death penalty is neither excessive nor disproportionate \r\n  to that imposed in similar cases.  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 721, cert. denied 531 U.S. 882 (2000); State v. Rosemond, \r\n  supra; State v.

Atkins, 303 S.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d 760 (1990), cert. denied \r\n  501 U.S. 1259 (1991).  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    While appellantâ€™s issues arise solely from the penalty phase of trial, we \r\n    recite the guilt phase evidence in order to place the penalty phase issues \r\n    in context.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    The tape consists of several calls to 911.  Appellant requested a large portion \r\n    of the third call which had been placed by Stacy and which reflects her distress \r\n    be redacted.  Over the Stateâ€™s objection, the trial judge agreed the bulk \r\n    of the third call should be redacted for purposes of the guilt phase.     \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    A second call is unclear.  The operator asks â€œwere they fighting?â€  The response \r\n    is inaudible.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    Testimony indicated appellant had a self-inflicted gunshot wound.    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Four live shotgun shells were \r\n    found in appellantâ€™s pockets.    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  \r\n    The State alleged the following statutory aggravating circumstances:  with \r\n    regard to Dorothy, two murders by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course \r\n    of conduct and during the commission of burglary; with regard to Linda, two \r\n    murders by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct and during \r\n    the commission of burglary; with regard to Stacy, two murders by one act or \r\n    pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, the murder was committed during \r\n    the commission of burglary, and the murder was committed while in the commission \r\n    of physical torture.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (C) (a)(1)(c) &amp; (h) and \r\n    (a)(9) (Supp. 2001).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  \r\n    The trial judge instructed the jury on the following statutory mitigating \r\n    circumstances:  1) appellant had no significant history of prior criminal \r\n    convictions involving the use of violence against another person, 2) the murder \r\n    was committed while appellant was under the influence of mental or emotional \r\n    disturbance, 3) appellantâ€™s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his \r\n    conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially \r\n    impaired, and 4) appellantâ€™s mentality at the time of the crime.  S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(b) (1)(2)(6)(7) (Supp. 2001).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  \r\n    The statutory aggravating circumstance of physical torture occurs (1) when \r\n    the victim is subjected to serious physical abuse before death or (2) when \r\n    the victim is subjected to an aggravated battery before death.

Hines, of Buist, Moore, Smythe &amp; McGee, P.A., of Charleston, for \r\n  Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This \r\n  is an action by Respondents, Allen Lee Hawkins (â€œHawkinsâ€) and Gryphon, Inc. \r\n  (â€œGryphonâ€), to set aside the delinquent tax sale of Hawkinsâ€™s sailboat, the \r\n  â€œLadyHawkâ€, to Petitioner, Bruno Yacht Sales (â€œBYSâ€).\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nIn December 1986, Hawkins \r\n  purchased a 52-foot sailboat made by Tayana, a Tawainese company.  Hawkins named \r\n  the boat the LadyHawk, and registered it as a United States vessel with the \r\n  Coast Guard.  In total, Hawkins spent just over $300,000 to purchase the hull \r\n  and to have the boat fully outfitted.  \r\nIn December 1989, Hawkins sold the LadyHawk \r\n  to Gryphon, a close corporation of which Hawkins was the sole shareholder, for \r\n  ten dollars.  In 1992, Gryphon transferred the LadyHawk back to Hawkins. [1]   At the time of this sale, the address of both Hawkins and \r\n  Gryphon was listed as â€œ50 Palmetto Bay Road, Box 200, Hilton Head, South Carolina, \r\n  29928.â€ \r\nIn 1994, Beaufort County assessed personal \r\n  property taxes of $2,417.10 on the LadyHawk, and sent a tax bill to Hawkins \r\n  for that amount at the Palmetto Bay address.  Hawkins failed to pay the taxes \r\n  and was assessed a penalty of $397.57 in addition to the taxes.  Hawkins failed \r\n  to pay either the taxes or the penalty by March 1995.  As a result, the Beaufort \r\n  County Treasurer issued a tax execution on March 17, 1995.\r\nThe Deputy Treasurer for Beaufort County \r\n  (â€œCountyâ€), Herschel Evans (â€œEvansâ€), testified that, according to the Countyâ€™s \r\n  normal procedure, the first notice of delinquent taxes would have been mailed \r\n  on April 1, 1995, and that the second delinquent notice, a levy by distress, \r\n  would have been mailed on May 1, 1995, by certified mail.  Hawkins testified \r\n  that he did not receive either of these notices, and there was no documentation \r\n  to confirm these notices were actually mailed. [2]   \r\nIn August 1995, the County Treasurer sent \r\n  Hawkins two notices of delinquent taxes by certified mail, postmarked August \r\n  16, 1995, and August 24, 1995, respectively.  The Treasurerâ€™s file does contain \r\n  senderâ€™s receipts and signed receipt cards for these mailings.  Delivery was \r\n  not restricted to Hawkins, and he did not sign for them, but he did receive \r\n  them in Florida by forwarded mail at the end of August. [3]   Upon receipt of these notices in August, Hawkins \r\n  retained a Beaufort attorney to contest his liability for the taxes.  To that \r\n  end, his attorney sent a letter to the County Treasurer stating that the LadyHawk \r\n  had not ever been in South Carolina for more than six months, and that Hawkins \r\n  was not a South Carolina resident.  Hawkins did not receive a response to the \r\n  letter, and did not make any effort to pay the delinquent taxes.\r\nOn September 22, 1995, the Treasurer advertised \r\n  Hawkinsâ€™s boat for sale in the Beaufort Gazette.  The advertisement listed Hawkinsâ€™s \r\n  name and his tax account number, PP550HAWALL, and the sum of taxes due, $2,814.67.  \r\n  A heading at the top of the advertisement indicated that account numbers beginning \r\n  in â€œPPâ€ related to boats.  \r\nBruno Yacht Sales (â€œBYSâ€) was the sole bidder at \r\n  the October 2, 1995, tax sale.  It purchased the LadyHawk for $2,814.67.  In \r\n  December 1995, several deputies forced Hawkins off his boat in Florida and turned \r\n  possession over to BYS.  \r\n On December 19, 1995, \r\n  Hawkins brought a â€œpetitoryâ€ admiralty claim in the United States District Court \r\n  for the Southern District of Florida, to arrest the LadyHawk and clear its title.  \r\n  Hawkinsâ€™s counsel argued among other things that the tax sale should have proceeded \r\n  against Gryphon as the true owner of the LadyHawk, based on the fact that the \r\n  1992 bill of sale from Gryphon to Hawkins was invalid, as the seller (Gryphon \r\n  - owned solely by Hawkins) had not signed it.  The District Court found it lacked \r\n  jurisdiction because Hawkins was neither the current owner nor the real party \r\n  in interest, and found further that it was not the proper forum to determine \r\n  the validity of South Carolina taxation decisions.  The District Court dismissed \r\n  the action without prejudice, and noted that its dismissal was not an adjudication \r\n  of title.  \r\nHawkins brought the instant action in \r\n  August 1996 to set aside the sale of the LadyHawk and to restrain BYS from selling \r\n  the LadyHawk.  The Master upheld the tax sale of the LadyHawk. [4]   The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, \r\n  finding the tax sale of the LadyHawk void.  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, \r\n  Inc., 342 S.C. 352, 536 S.E.2d 698 (Ct. App. 2000).  Petitioners raise the \r\n  following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the tax sale of the LadyHawk void pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 (Supp. 1994) because of defects in the levy notice, \r\n  in the mailing of the notice, or in the description of the LadyHawk in the advertisement?\r\n    \r\n      Did the Court of Appeals err in failing to hold that Hawkins was judicially \r\n  estopped from asserting ownership of the LadyHawk based on his argument to the \r\n  contrary before the Florida District Court?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nI.  Tax Sale\r\nPetitioners argue \r\n  that the Court of Appeals erred in finding the tax sale of the LadyHawk void \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 (Supp. 1994).  The Court of Appeals found the \r\n  following three errors in the tax sale:  (1) the levy notice included an artificial \r\n  deadline for payment; (2) the notices should have been mailed restricted delivery; \r\n  and (3) the LadyHawk was not described sufficiently in the published tax sale \r\n  advertisement. \r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nArtificial \r\n  Deadline  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 controls the \r\n  procedure for notifying delinquent taxpayers that property will be sold in order \r\n  to collect delinquent taxes.  This Court has held that â€œ[t]ax sales must be \r\n  conducted in strict compliance with statutory requirements.â€  Ryan Inv. Co. \r\n  v. Richland County, 335 S.C. 392, 394, 517 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1999) (citing \r\n  Dibble v. Bryant, 274 S.C. 481, 265 S.E.2d 673 (1980)).  Further, the \r\n  fact that the defaulting taxpayer has actual notice of the impending tax sale \r\n  â€œis insufficient to uphold a tax sale absent strict compliance with statutory \r\n  requirements.â€  Ryan, 335 S.C. at 394, 517 S.E.2d at 693 (emphasis added). \r\n  [5]   Finally, failure to give the required notice of a tax sale is a fundamental \r\n  defect in the tax sale proceedings that renders the proceedings absolutely void.  \r\n  Rives v. Bulsa, 325 S.C. 287, 478 S.E.2d 878 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(a) requires \r\n  the county treasurer to mail a notice as close to April 1st as possible, \r\n  specifying that â€œif the taxes, penalties, assessments, and costs are not paid, \r\n  the property must be advertised and sold to satisfy the delinquency.â€  If the \r\n  taxes remain unpaid thirty days after the mailing of the April 1 notice, the \r\n  treasurer is entitled to â€œtake exclusive possession of as much of the defaulting \r\n  taxpayerâ€™s property as is necessary to satisfy the payment of taxes, assessments, \r\n  penalties, and costs.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(b).  For personal property, \r\n  this section provides that exclusive possession is taken by mailing the notice \r\n  of delinquent taxes to the address shown on the tax receipt.  The statute mandates \r\n  that \r\n\r\nall delinquent notices shall specify that if the taxes, assessments, \r\n  penalties, and costs are not paid on or before a subsequent sales date, \r\n  the property must be duly advertised and sold for delinquent property taxes, \r\n  assessments, penalties, and costs. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(b) \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nThe first notice received \r\n  by Hawkins in August showed the amount due and was stamped with the following \r\n  statement:\r\n\r\nIF NOT PAID ON OR BEFORE 31 AUGUST \r\n  THIS PROPERTY WILL BE DULY ADVERTISED AND SOLD FOR DELINQUENT TAXES AS DESCRIBED \r\n  ABOVE ON THE FIRST MONDAY IN OCTOBER THIS YEAR.  RETURN OF THIS â€œCERTIFIED RECEIPTâ€ \r\n  SHALL BE DEEMED EQUIVALENT TO â€œLEVYING BY DISTRESS.â€ \r\n\r\nThe second notice, dated August \r\n  24, was accompanied by a letter from the County Treasurer, Joy Logan.  The letter \r\n  reiterated that the taxes were delinquent, and that the property was subject \r\n  to sale at the October 2, 1995, tax sale, but stated â€œ[a]ll tax payments must \r\n  be received by September 15, 1995 to avoid your name and property being advertised \r\n  in The Beaufort Gazette and The Island Packet.â€\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  held that these two notices created artificial deadlines for payment before \r\n  the sales date, and thereby contradicted the statutory language requiring that \r\n  the notice inform the delinquent taxpayer that the taxes must be paid â€œbefore \r\n  a subsequent sales date.â€  Because the sales date in this instance was October \r\n  2, the Court of Appeals found that the August 31 and September 15 deadlines \r\n  were artificial, and gave the impression that Hawkins had to pay the taxes weeks \r\n  before the date of sale.  We agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding on this \r\n  issue.\r\nThe County argues that \r\n  this reading of section 12-51-40(b) conflicts with the advertising requirements \r\n  of section 12-51-40(d).  We disagree.  Section 12-51-40(d) explains how the \r\n  property must be advertised before auction, and requires that the advertising \r\n  be published once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the sale.  The Countyâ€™s \r\n  argument depends on their interpretation of section b that a specified date \r\n  must pass without payment before the Countyâ€™s authority to advertise is triggered.  \r\n  At trial, however, the Deputy Treasurer, Evans, testified that Hawkins could \r\n  have paid the delinquent taxes up until the date of the October 2 tax sale, \r\n  beyond the August 31 and September 15 deadlines set in the two notices.  Although \r\n  we realize the County would rather not advertise until it knows the taxpayer \r\n  can no longer pay the delinquent taxes, the statute does not provide that the \r\n  County set a date, other than the sales date, after which the taxpayer can no \r\n  longer pay his delinquent taxes before the County can begin advertising.\r\nBased on the standing \r\n  rule that the County must conduct tax sales in â€œstrict compliance with the statutory \r\n  requirements,â€ we find that the levy notice was not properly worded, and set \r\n  aside the tax sale on that basis.  Ryan; Dibble.  \r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRestricted Delivery  \r\nPetitioners argue that \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in finding that a levy notice for a delinquent personal \r\n  property tax sale must be sent via â€œrestricted deliveryâ€ mail in order to be \r\n  valid.  We agree.\r\nSection 12-51-40(b) provides the relevant language \r\n  to resolve this issue.  As discussed, this section provides that the treasurer \r\n  take exclusive possession of property by sending a notice to the taxpayer.  \r\n  Specifically, it states, \r\n\r\n[i]n the case of real property, exclusive possession is \r\n  taken by mailing a notice of delinquent property taxes, assessments, penalties, \r\n  and costs to the defaulting taxpayer at the address shown on the tax receipt \r\n  or to a more correct address known to the officer, by â€œcertified mail, return \r\n  receipt requested - deliver to addressee only.â€  In the case of personal property, \r\n  exclusive possession is taken by mailing the notice of delinquent property taxes, \r\n  assessments, penalties, and costs to the address shown on the tax receipt or \r\n  to a more correct address known to the officer. . . . The return receipt of \r\n  the â€œcertified mailâ€ notice is equivalent to â€œlevying by distress.â€ \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(b).\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  found that the certified mail and restricted delivery requirements listed for \r\n  real property also applied to personal property based on the last sentence of \r\n  section 12-51-40(b):  â€œThe return receipt of the â€˜certified mailâ€™ notice is \r\n  equivalent to â€˜levying by distress.â€™â€  The Court of Appeals also relied on language \r\n  in S.C. Code section 12-51-40(c) that refers to the procedure for taking possession \r\n  of real and personal property when the certified mail notice has been returned, \r\n  to find that the legislature intended for the certified mail and restricted \r\n  delivery requirements for real property in section 12-51-40(b) to also apply \r\n  to personal property.  Although we agree that the legislature intended the certified \r\n  mail requirements to apply to both real and personal property, prior versions \r\n  of the statute convince us that the legislature did not intend to require notices \r\n  on personal property to be mailed restricted delivery.  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(a) (1976); Act No. 378 at Â§ 4, 1971 S.C. Acts 500. [6]   \r\nAlthough there is no \r\n  specific mailing requirement for personal property in the statute, it appears \r\n  that levy notices on personal property must be sent via certified mail, return \r\n  receipt requested in order to accomplish â€œlevy by distress.â€  The cardinal rule \r\n  of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.  \r\n  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd., 313 S.C. \r\n  1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993).  In our opinion, the legislature intended to be able \r\n  to â€œlevy by distressâ€ on personal property as well as real property, and to \r\n  do so requires that the notice be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested.  \r\n  It is not necessary, however, that the notice be sent restricted delivery in \r\n  order for the County to â€œlevy by distressâ€ under the terms the statute.  There \r\n  is no mention of restricted delivery anywhere in the statute with regard to \r\n  personal property, and we do not believe the legislature intended that delinquent \r\n  tax notices for personal property must be sent restricted delivery.  Based on \r\n  the 1976 version of the statute, it appears instead that the legislature intended \r\n  to relax the notice requirements for personal property by amending the statute \r\n  to require restricted delivery for real property only.  \r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAdvertisement  \r\nPetitioners argue that \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the advertisement of the LadyHawk \r\n  was insufficient under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(d) (Supp. 1994).  We agree.\r\nâ€œ[A]ll requirements \r\n  of law leading up to tax sales which are intended for the protection of the \r\n  tax payer [sic] against surprise or the sacrifice of his property are to be \r\n  regarded as mandatory and are strictly enforced.â€  Rives v. Bulsa, 325 \r\n  S.C. 287, 292-93, 478 S.E.2d 878, 881 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing Dibble, 274 \r\n  S.C. 481, 265 S.E.2d 673).  South Carolina Code section 12-51-40(d) explains \r\n  the procedure for advertising which the County is required to follow before \r\n  selling the delinquent taxpayerâ€™s property.  It provides, in relevant part,\r\n\r\nThe property must be advertised \r\n  for sale at public auction.  The advertisement must be in a newspaper of general \r\n  circulation . . . and must be entitled â€œDelinquent Tax Sale.â€  It shall \r\n  include the delinquent taxpayerâ€™s name and the description of the property, \r\n  a reference to the county auditorâ€™s map-block-parcel number being sufficient \r\n  for a description of realty.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(d) \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nIn this case, the County advertised the \r\n  sale of the LadyHawk in the Beaufort Gazette, and included Hawkinsâ€™s name and \r\n  the delinquent tax number â€œPP550HAWALL.â€  Before listing the personal and real \r\n  property, the advertisement indicated that the accounts beginning in â€œPPâ€ referred \r\n  to boats.\r\nThe Court of Appeals relied on the definition \r\n  of â€œdescriptionâ€ in Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary to find this description \r\n  of the LadyHawk  insufficient.  â€œA â€˜descriptionâ€™ is defined as â€˜[a] delineation \r\n  or account of a particular subject by the recital of its characteristic accidents \r\n  and qualities.â€™â€  Hawkins, 342 S.C. at 364, 536 S.E.2d at 704 (citing \r\n  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 445 (6th ed. 1990)).  The Court of \r\n  Appeals reasoned that the description given by the County did not meet this \r\n  definition, and further, that the description was intended to protect the taxpayer \r\n  from unfair surprise and sacrifice, and as such, should have included the characteristics \r\n  of the boat, such as its size.  Id.\r\nIn our opinion, the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  analysis fails to explain why the listing of the taxpayerâ€™s name and tax account \r\n  number, which was listed on the notices of delinquent taxes that Hawkins admitted \r\n  receiving, is insufficient to alert him to the sale of the LadyHawk.  Also, \r\n  the Court of Appeals fails to account for the reason such a description is sufficient \r\n  for real property, but is insufficient for personal property when interested \r\n  persons can discover the details of both types of property by using the tax \r\n  account number to look up further information in the county tax assessorâ€™s office.  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(d).  In fact, Frank Bruno, owner of BYS, \r\n  was able to discover the specific characteristics of the LadyHawk prior to the \r\n  sale by entering the tax account number in the Countyâ€™s computer system.\r\nWe see no reason why the County should \r\n  have to use a different method of describing personal property than the method \r\n  the statute explicitly defines as sufficient for real property when it affords \r\n  the taxpayer and potential buyer with an opportunity to look up further information.  \r\n  Therefore, we find that the description of the LadyHawk in the tax sale advertisement \r\n  was sufficient under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(d). \r\nII.      Judicial Estoppel\r\nPetitioners argue that the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred in failing to find Hawkins was judicially estopped from asserting ownership \r\n  of the LadyHawk for purposes of this action.  We disagree.     \r\nAs discussed, at some \r\n  point prior to 1992, Hawkins transferred ownership of the LadyHawk to his corporation, \r\n  Gryphon.  Pursuant to a family court order following his divorce, in 1992, Gryphon \r\n  transferred the LadyHawk back to Hawkins.  Hawkins submitted a bill of sale \r\n  noting this transfer of ownership to the Coast Guard, but it was not notarized, \r\n  so Hawkins had to submit a second bill of sale.  The Coast Guard accepted the \r\n  second bill of sale despite its lack of a sellerâ€™s signature, and recorded Hawkins \r\n  as the record owner. \r\nAfter the LadyHawk was sold to BYS, Hawkins brought \r\n  an action in the Florida Federal District Court to quiet title to the boat in \r\n  his name.  One of the arguments Hawkins presented to the District Court was \r\n  that the bill of sale from Gryphon to Hawkins was invalid, and, therefore, that \r\n  Gryphon owned the LadyHawk at the time of the tax sale.  If Gryphon owned the \r\n  LadyHawk, the tax sale presumably would have been void because Gryphon never \r\n  received a delinquent notice.  The District Court dismissed the action without \r\n  prejudice, holding that the court had no jurisdiction to quiet title in Hawkinsâ€™s \r\n  name, in part, because Hawkins claimed not to be the owner.  The court stated, \r\n  however, â€œ[this] dismissal is not an adjudication of title.â€  Subsequently, \r\n  Hawkins filed this action in state court.\r\nThis Court officially recognized the validity of \r\n  judicial estoppel in Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, \r\n  489 S.E.2d 472 (1997).  â€œJudicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting a \r\n  position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same or related litigation.â€  \r\n  Hayne, 327 S.C. at 251, 327 S.E.2d at 477.  The Court went on to enunciate \r\n  the purpose of the doctrine, making clear that it is intended â€œto protect the \r\n  integrity of courts rather than to protect litigants from allegedly improper \r\n  or deceitful conduct by their adversaries.â€  Id.  The Court limited the \r\n  doctrine to inconsistent statements of fact, holding that the doctrine does \r\n  not apply to assertions of legal theories.  Id.  The Court applied judicial \r\n  estoppel in Hayne to prevent the defendant from arguing that he was the \r\n  owner of certain property when he had successfully disclaimed ownership \r\n  of the same property during his divorce.  The defendant even admitted to lying \r\n  under oath in order to protect his interest in his divorce proceeding.  The \r\n  Court noted, â€œ[a]lthough parties may vigorously assert their version of the \r\n  facts, they may not misrepresent those facts in order to gain advantage in the \r\n  process. . . . When a party has formally asserted a certain version of the facts \r\n  in litigation, he cannot later change those facts when the initial version no \r\n  longer suits him.â€  Id. at 252, 489 S.E.2d at 477.\r\nThe facts of this case are quite different from \r\n  the situation in Hayne.  The record on appeal does not include the transcript \r\n  of the hearing before the District Court, but Hawkinsâ€™s attorney stated that \r\n  Hawkins did not testify before the District Court.  Hawkins did not prevail \r\n  in the District Court - the District Court did not quiet title in his name - \r\n  by asserting Gryphon owned the LadyHawk.  Judicial estoppel comes into play \r\n  when the court is forced to take a position based on a factual assertion.  Here, \r\n  the District Court did not determine who owned the LadyHawk prior to the tax \r\n  sale, and stated explicitly that its decision was not an adjudication of title.  \r\n  See Zimmerman v. Central Union Bank, 194 S.C. 518, 532, 85 S.E.2d 359, \r\n  365 (1940) (â€œ[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, \r\n  and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, \r\n  simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position.â€) (emphasis \r\n  added).  \r\nFurther, after hearing the arguments for judicial \r\n  estoppel based on the District Court action, the Master appears to have proceeded \r\n  on the basis that everyone agreed that Hawkins was the real party in interest.  \r\n  This discussion in turn led Hawkins to abandon his argument that Gryphon was \r\n  the true owner.  \r\nThe question of whether title was transferred from \r\n  Gryphon to Hawkins in 1992 is a legal, not a factual assertion.  There is no \r\n  evidence that Hawkins claimed that he had no intention of placing ownership \r\n  of LadyHawk in his own name.  He simply argued that the actual transfer was \r\n  not effective because it was flawed.  Therefore, this is not an appropriate \r\n  case for judicial estoppel.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  we AFFIRM AS MODIFIED the decision of the Court of Appeals setting aside \r\n  the tax sale of the LadyHawk.\r\n WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Henry F. Floyd,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Initially, the Coast Guard refused to record the bill of sale from \r\n    Gryphon, Inc. back to Hawkins because it was not notarized.  A new bill of \r\n    sale was prepared and notarized, but the box for the sellerâ€™s signature was \r\n    left blank in the second bill of sale.  The Coast Guard recorded it notwithstanding \r\n    this mistake, and a June 1992 Coast Guard document lists Hawkins as the record \r\n    owner.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Hawkins testified he sailed the LadyHawk from South Carolina to Florida \r\n    in May 1995, but that he checked his mail at the Palmetto Bay address before \r\n    he left.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Hawkins testified that the Palmetto Road box belonged to his wife, \r\n    and that she mailed him a packet of mail at the end of August that contained \r\n    the two tax notices.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   While the case was pending before the Master-in-Equity, \r\n    BYS sold the LadyHawk (now named â€œMysticâ€) to a third party for $150,000.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The Court granted a motion by BYS to argue against this precedent \r\n    in favor of a rule that actual notice of delinquent taxes and impending sale \r\n    is sufficient.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  The 1976 version of section 12-51-40(a) did not differentiate between \r\n    personal and real property for purposes of mailing.

Westbrook, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25593\r\nHeard January 7, 2003 - Filed February \r\n  10, 2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, of South Carolina Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for appellants.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Cecil Kelley Jackson, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  Appellants were jointly tried and convicted of two \r\n  counts of taking a hostage and one count of carrying a weapon while an inmate.  \r\n  Each received two consecutive sentences of life without the possibility of parole \r\n  for the hostage-takings, and a consecutive ten-year sentence for the weapons \r\n  offense.  On appeal, [1]  appellants contend the trial \r\n  court erred in dismissing a juror who had indicated he would not take a religious \r\n  oath.  We agree, and reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nFollowing jury selection, \r\n  the trial judge announced that he had been informed that one of the jurors selected \r\n  (Juror 126) told court personnel that he thought there were â€œsome constitutional \r\n  problems about having to swear.â€\r\nJuror 126 was brought into the courtroom.  The trial judge had the \r\n  clerk of court read the oath that she administers to jurors to Juror 126:\r\n\r\nYou shall well and truly try the issues joined in the case \r\n  and a true verdict give according to the evidence so help you God.\r\n\r\nJuror 126 stated he had trouble \r\n  with the phrase â€œso help you Godâ€ because he was not religious, and because \r\n  he thought it violated the constitutional requirement of separation of church \r\n  and state.  The judge asked Juror 126 if he would have trouble taking the oath.  \r\n  The juror responded by asking whether he had an â€œalternative to doing that?â€  \r\n  The judge answered, â€œWell, if you sit on the jury, you have to take that oath.â€  \r\n  Juror 126 then said, â€œIâ€™m not comfortable with that.â€\r\nJuror 126 was excused from the courtroom, \r\n  and the judge ruled:\r\n\r\nAnd our South Carolina Supreme Court has said that before \r\n  you can be a juror, our law says before you can be a juror, youâ€™ve got to take \r\n  that oath and that is the bottom line.  Before you do anything else, thatâ€™s \r\n  the bottom line.  Heâ€™s got to be able to take that oath.  And if we come in \r\n  here first thing tomorrow and she starts giving the oath and he says he is not \r\n  going to take it, I have no choice but to eliminate him as a juror.\r\n\r\nWhen court resumed the next day, the trial judge \r\n  excused Juror 126 and replaced him with an alternate juror.  Appellantsâ€™ attorneysâ€™ \r\n  objections to the jurorâ€™s removal were overruled.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the trial judge erred in dismissing a juror who \r\n  was unwilling to take a religious oath?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe State concedes that South Carolina cannot, \r\n  consonant with the federal constitution, condition juror service upon the taking \r\n  of a religious oath. [2]   See 47 Am. Jur. 2d Jury Â§ 177 (1995).  \r\n  In fact, South Carolina law specifically permits a juror to make an affirmation \r\n  rather than swear an oath.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1130 (Supp. 2002). \r\n  [3]   The trial judge erred in holding that jurors were required to take \r\n  the oath used by the clerk of court, \r\n  [4]  and in dismissing Juror 126.\r\nThe dismissal of Juror 126 constituted a violation \r\n  of the jurorâ€™s constitutional rights. Cf., Batson v. Kentucky, \r\n  476 U.S. 79 (1986) (Equal Protection violated where peremptory challenges exercised \r\n  in a racially discriminatory manner); J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. \r\n  T.B., 511 U.S. 127 (1994) (gender discrimination in exercise of peremptories \r\n  is Equal Protection violation); State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d \r\n  366 (1996) (when a trial judge erroneously upholds a discriminatory juror strike, \r\n  the jurorâ€™s Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights have been violated).  \r\n  Further, Juror 126 was erroneously removed over appellantsâ€™ objections.  Appellants \r\n  may therefore appeal this violation of their right to a fair and impartial jury. \r\n  [5]  Id.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n          Appellants were denied a fair and impartial jury \r\n  when the trial judge erroneously excused a juror who objected to taking a religious \r\n  oath.  Accordingly, their convictions and sentences are reversed, and the cases \r\n  remanded. \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Appellantsâ€™ appeals were consolidated for oral \r\n    argument because they raised two identical issues.  At oral argument, their \r\n    attorney conceded the second issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Some state constitutions explicitly proscribe \r\n    religious qualifications for juror service.  See e.g., Ariz. Const. \r\n    art. 2, Â§ 12; Cal. Const. art. I, Â§ 4; Mo. Const. art. I, Â§ 5; N.M. Const. \r\n    art. VII, Â§ 3; N.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 28; N.D. Const. art. I, Â§ 3; Or. Const. \r\n    art. I, Â§ 6; Tenn. Const. art. I, Â§ 6; Utah Const. art. 1, Â§ 4; Wash. Const. art. I, Â§ \r\n    11; W.Va. Const. art. 3, Â§ 11; Wyo. Const. art. 1, Â§ 18.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  An affirmation in lieu of an oath has been permitted \r\n    in South Carolina courts since at least 1731.  See 1731 Act No. 522, \r\n    Â§ 28, reported in Statutes of South Carolina, vol. III, p. 281 (1838).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The oath used here is a variation on the oath \r\n    contained in Form 3, the â€œUniform Juror Information Pamphlet,â€ promulgated \r\n    pursuant to Rule 84, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Juror 126 was improperly removed from appellantsâ€™ \r\n    jury because of his religious beliefs.  Where the jury that tries the complaining \r\n    party is affected by this type of constitutional error, the line of cases \r\n    which hold a defendant is entitled only to a fair and impartial jury but has \r\n    no right to trial by a particular jury, do not apply.

Myers, of Lexington; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:  \r\n  Appellant, Jeffrey Haselden, was convicted of the murder of his two-year \r\n  old son, Joshua. [1]   The jury \r\n  found the aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed while in the \r\n  commission of physical torture, and that the murder was of a child under eleven \r\n  years of age; it recommended a sentence of death.  We affirm the murder conviction, \r\n  but reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding.    \r\nFACTS\r\nShortly after midnight on Thursday, \r\n  May 13, 1999, Haseldenâ€™s girlfriend, Rebecca Tindall, called 9-1-1 in Lexington \r\n  County to report that she had found two-year old Joshua Haselden on the floor \r\n  of his bedroom not breathing.  When paramedics arrived, they found Tindall administering \r\n  CPR on Joshua.  Haselden advised paramedics they had checked on Joshua twenty \r\n  minutes prior to calling 9-1-1 and he had been fine.  Joshua had noticeable \r\n  swelling and bruising throughout his abdomen, from the waistline to the ribcage.  \r\n  Joshua was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:40 AM.  \r\nAt trial, Tindall testified she had just \r\n  finished giving Joshua his bath and putting him to bed when Haselden arrived \r\n  home from running an errand for her.  She heard Haselden yell at Joshua to â€œget \r\n  his ass back to bed.â€  She and Haselden then went to Joshuaâ€™s room to check \r\n  on him as he had a habit of sticking things up his nose.  They retrieved a foreign \r\n  object from his nose, after which Haselden hit Joshua in the head four or five \r\n  times.  â€œHaselden had a golf ball on his key chain and he hit him in the top \r\n  of the head with it.  Then [Haselden] pulled [Joshua] up and was shaking him \r\n  and then he pushed him at me and told me to put him to bed and not to kiss him \r\n  good night either.â€  Sometime around 11:00 PM, she went to put some laundry \r\n  in the dryer.  She heard Haselden yell â€œGoddammit Josh,â€ and heard a noise like \r\n  a thud.  She went into Joshâ€™s room and saw Haselden swinging his arm hitting \r\n  Josh hard in the stomach area three or four times and hollering, â€œDo you hear \r\n  me boy, do you hear me?â€  She grabbed Haseldenâ€™s shirt and told him that was \r\n  enough.  Haselden told her heâ€™d punish his son the way he wanted to, and pushed \r\n  her, causing her to stumble and fall, knocking both her and Joshua to the ground.  \r\n  Haselden told her to get out and she complied.  A few minutes later, she went \r\n  back down the hallway and saw Joshua still lying on the floor.  She started \r\n  to go in and pick him up, but Haselden told her Josh was fine and to leave him \r\n  alone.  They went back to Haseldenâ€™s bedroom and had sex, after which she snuck \r\n  back into Joshuaâ€™s room and found him limp and began screaming for Haselden.  \r\n  Haselden told her to call 9-1-1.  \r\nAn autopsy was performed \r\n  on May 14, 1999.  There was a bruise on the right side of Joshuaâ€™s forehead \r\n  which was consistent with being hit with a golf ball key chain.  An internal \r\n  examination of Joshuaâ€™s scalp revealed a total of eight areas of bruising, only \r\n  one of which was visible from the outside.  There were a number of bruises on \r\n  the lower legs, and significant bruises on the abdomen.  The pathologist, Dr. \r\n  Sexton, found â€œextensive injuries inside the abdomen.â€  He opined the abdominal \r\n  bruises were consistent with a blow from the knuckles and, in his opinion, the \r\n  bruising could not have resulted from doing CPR.  He concluded that there were \r\n  at least six blows to the abdomen.  Further examination revealed internal bruising \r\n  under the skin near the belly button, and a lot of blood in the abdominal cavity \r\n  which had been caused by several areas of the intestine being separated from \r\n  the mesentery (the structure that holds the intestines together).  Dr. Sexton \r\n  concluded there were two causes of death either of which could have been fatal; \r\n  internal bleeding in the abdomen and swelling in the brain caused by the blows \r\n  to the head.  \r\nThe jury convicted Haselden of murder \r\n  and found the aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed while \r\n  in the commission of physical torture, and that the murder was of a child under \r\n  eleven years of age; it recommended a sentence of death.   \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in allowing \r\n  the testimony of Haseldenâ€™s ex-wife concerning his golfing and fishing habits?  \r\n\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Haselden entitled to a parole \r\n  ineligibility charge?  \r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were autopsy photographs of Joshua \r\n  improperly admitted?  \r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEX-WIFEâ€™S TESTIMONY  \r\nDuring the guilt or innocence phase of \r\n  trial, the state called Haseldenâ€™s ex-wife, Robin Lucas.  The two had married \r\n  shortly after the birth of their daughter, Felicia, when Lucas was eighteen \r\n  years old, and Haselden was twenty-four.  Lucas testified that they did not \r\n  have a stable marriage.  Joshua was born in December 1996.  The solicitor asked \r\n  Lucas whether Haselden was working when Joshua was born, and Lucas replied that \r\n  he â€œworked all the time.â€  The solicitor continued, â€œIf he wasnâ€™t working, what \r\n  was he doing?â€ to which she replied, over defense counselâ€™s objection of irrelevancy, \r\n  that â€œhe was fishing or golfing with his friends or at his mothers.â€  She further \r\n  testified that Haselden did not spend much time with her or Joshua.  \r\nHaselden argues his \r\n  ex-wifeâ€™s testimony concerning his golfing and fishing habits constituted an \r\n  improper attack on his character.  We disagree.\r\nInitially, Haselden did not object \r\n  to this testimony on the grounds that it was improper character evidence below.  \r\n  He objected only on the basis of relevancy.  Accordingly, this issue is not \r\n  preserved for review.  State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) \r\n  (defendant may not argue one ground below and another on appeal).  In any event, \r\n  Haselden has not demonstrated reversible error.  \r\nCharacter evidence is not admissible \r\n  to prove the accused possesses a criminal character or has a propensity to commit \r\n  the crime with which he is charged.  Rule 404(a), SCRE, states the general rule \r\n  that &quot;[e]vidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not \r\n  admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular \r\n  occasion.&quot;  State v. Brown, 344 S.C. 70, 543 S.E.2d 552 (2001).   \r\n  Evidence Haselden had a tendency to golf, fish, or go to his motherâ€™s house \r\n  is simply not evidence which would tend to prove he had a tendency toward abusing \r\n  and murdering his two-year old son.  Brown, supra (whatever negative \r\n  connotation appellant's gambling may have had, it did not imply any propensity \r\n  on his part to commit the violent crime with which he was charged, such that \r\n  any error in its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).  \r\nIn any event, even assuming this evidence \r\n  was objectionable, this Court has held that where there is other properly admitted \r\n  evidence of conduct demonstrating the particular character trait in question, \r\n  there is no reversible error.  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d 300 (2001).  Whether an error in the admission of evidence is harmless \r\n  generally depends upon its materiality in relation to the case as a whole.  \r\n  State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990).  The erroneous \r\n  admission of character evidence is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if its \r\n  impact is minimal in the context of the entire record.  State v. Forney, \r\n  321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641 (1996). \r\nHere, Haseldenâ€™s girlfriend Tindall was \r\n  questioned as to how she began dating Haselden.  She explained that she began \r\n  as a babysitter for the children.  The solicitor asked where Haselden would \r\n  be when she was babysitting, to which she responded, â€œhe would either be playing \r\n  golf or working.â€  Further, Haselden admitted on cross-examination that he played \r\n  a lot of golf.  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) \r\n  (any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence \r\n  is harmless); State v. Johnson, 298 S.C. 496, 499, 381 S.E.2d 732, 733 \r\n  (1989) (admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative \r\n  to other evidence).  We find any error in admission of this evidence was clearly \r\n  harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPAROLE INELIGIBILITY CHARGE\r\nHaselden next asserts \r\n  the trial court erred, at sentencing, in refusing to instruct the jury that \r\n  if sentenced to life imprisonment, he would be ineligible for parole.  We agree.  \r\n\r\nAt trial, Haselden requested \r\n  a parole ineligibility charge pursuant to Simmons v. South Carolina, \r\n  512 U.S. 154 (1994).  In Simmons, the United States Supreme Court held \r\n  that where the evidence raises an issue of future dangerousness, due process \r\n  requires the jury be instructed of a defendantâ€™s parole ineligibility.  The \r\n  trial court refused the request.  Haseldenâ€™s sentencing phase took place approximately \r\n  one month prior to the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Shafer v. \r\n  South Carolina, 532 U.S. 36, 121 S.Ct. 1263 (2001)(remanding to this Court \r\n  for a determination whether the evidence and argument raised the issue of future \r\n  dangerousness).  Haselden moved for a new sentencing hearing under Shafer, \r\n  contending the state had placed his future dangerousness at issue.  The trial \r\n  court denied the motion.  Thereafter, the United States Supreme Court decided \r\n  Kelly v. South Carolina, 534 U.S. 246, 122 S.Ct. 726 (2002), which, as \r\n  we recently recognized in State v. Shafer, Op. No. 25562 (S.C. S.Ct. \r\n  filed Nov. 25, 2002)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 39 at 38), expanded the law of what \r\n  evidence or argument raises future dangerousness.  Haselden contends he was \r\n  entitled to a parole ineligibility instruction under Kelly, Shafer, \r\n  and Simmons.  We agree.\r\nIn Kelly, the United States Supreme Court \r\n  stated â€œ[a] jury hearing evidence of a defendantâ€™s demonstrated propensity for \r\n  violence reasonably will conclude that he presents a risk of violent behavior, \r\n  whether locked up or free, and whether free as a fugitive or as a parolee.â€  \r\n  534 U.S. at     , 122 S.Ct. at 731.  The Kelly Court went on to \r\n  state that â€œevidence of dangerous â€˜characterâ€™ may show â€˜characteristicâ€™ future \r\n  dangerousness. . . [e]vidence of future dangerousness under Simmons is \r\n  evidence with a tendency to prove dangerousness in the future; its relevance \r\n  to that point does not disappear merely because it might support other inferences \r\n  or be described in other terms.â€  534 U.S. at     , 122 S.Ct. at 732.  \r\n  The Court then analyzed the specifics of the prosecutionâ€™s argument in that \r\n  case, to wit: (1) the prosecution expressed its hope the jurors would â€œnever \r\n  in [their] lives again have to experience . . . [b]eing some thirty feet away \r\n  from such a person;â€ (2) the prosecution characterized Kelly as a dangerous \r\n  bloody butcher; (3) the prosecution stated Kelly was â€œmore frightening than \r\n  a serial killerâ€ and that â€œmurderers will be murderers.â€  The Court found that \r\n  â€œKellyâ€™s jury, like its predecessor in Simmons, [was] invited to infer \r\n  â€˜that petitioner is a vicious predator who would pose a continuing threat to \r\n  the community.â€™â€  534 U.S. at     , 122 S.Ct. at 732-33.\r\nHere, although the state did not directly argue \r\n  Haseldenâ€™s future dangerousness, it is patent that the evidence presented and \r\n  argument thereon placed Haseldenâ€™s future dangerousness in issue.  As in Kelly, \r\n  the solicitor here argued that he hoped the jury would never in its lives be \r\n  thirty feet away from a baby-killer.  The solicitor compared Haselden to a Dr. \r\n  Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and called him the â€œevil Mr. Haselden.â€  The solicitor \r\n  also referred to the Night Stalker Special Task Forces Unit Haselden was in \r\n  while in the army, and its motto, â€œDeath waits in the dark.â€  During penalty \r\n  phase, a correctional officer from Lee County Correctional Institute testified \r\n  that while in county safekeeping awaiting trial, there was an incident in which \r\n  Haselden had to be restrained with pepper spray.  Further, during the guilt \r\n  phase of trial, the state elicited testimony from Haseldenâ€™s girlfriend, Becky \r\n  Tindall, that immediately after Joshuaâ€™s death, Haselden had threatened her \r\n  babies, saying â€it would be ashamed [sic] if something happened to one of your \r\n  babies, wouldnâ€™t it Becky,â€ and that he had told her he had ways of eliminating \r\n  people, having been in special forces.  \r\nThe above evidence clearly raises inferences \r\n  of future dangerousness, placing Haselden within the ambit of Kelly.  \r\n  Accordingly, he was entitled to a jury instruction that, if sentenced to life \r\n  imprisonment, he would be ineligible for parole.  Accordingly, we reverse and \r\n  remand for a new sentencing proceeding.\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGRUESOME AUTOPSY PHOTOS\r\nFinally, Haselden asserts \r\n  the trial court erroneously admitted several autopsy photographs (Exhibits 23-26, \r\n  29, and 31-33) of Joshua.  In particular, he objects to Exhibit 29, an enlarged \r\n  photo of Joshuaâ€™s anus.  Although we find the remaining photos were properly \r\n  admitted, we agree with Haselden that exhibit 29 was irrelevant to any issue \r\n  at sentencing.  Accordingly, we hold that it may not be admitted at resentencing.  \r\n\r\nThe relevance, materiality \r\n  and admissibility of photographs are matters within the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial court and a ruling will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse \r\n  of discretion.  State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996), \r\n  cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1200 (1997).  The purpose of the sentencing phase \r\n  in a capital trial is to &quot;direct the jury's attention to the specific circumstances \r\n  of the crime and the characteristics of the offender.&quot;  State v. Matthews, \r\n  296 S.C. 379, 390, 373 S.E.2d 587, 594 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. \r\n  1091, 109 S.Ct. 1559, 103 L.Ed.2d 861 (1989).  Photographs may be offered as \r\n  evidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation.  State v. Ard, 332 \r\n  S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998).  In State v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, \r\n  518 S.E.2d 588 (1999), this Court held that in the sentencing phase, the scope \r\n  of the probative value of such photos is much broader than at the guilt or innocence \r\n  phase.  In State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 525 S.E.2d 519 (2000), we \r\n  noted that, notwithstanding the sometime gory nature of autopsy photographs, \r\n  they are nonetheless admissible where they reveal the true nature of the attack, \r\n  and allow the jury to determine the existence of physical torture.  338 S.C. \r\n  at 129-130, 525 S.E.2d at 527.  Further, there is no abuse of discretion if \r\n  the offered photograph serves to corroborate testimony.  Id.\r\nThe majority of the challenged \r\n  photographs were necessary to corroborate the pathologistâ€™s testimony, to understand \r\n  the true nature of the attack on Joshua, and were relevant to demonstrate the \r\n  aggravating circumstance of physical torture.  \r\nExhibits 23 and 24 are photographs \r\n  of the left and right side of Joshuaâ€™s head.  The pathologist testified that \r\n  he had to dissect from ear to ear and â€œreflect the scalp forwardâ€  to be able \r\n  to see the large areas of bruising which could not be seen from outside.  Exhibit \r\n  25 is a photo of the back of Joshuaâ€™s head, and more clearly reveals the extent \r\n  of the bruising.  Exhibit 26 is a photo of Joshuaâ€™s brain from the top of the \r\n  head.  Dr. Sexton testified that the color of the brain, and the lack of blood \r\n  on top was significant as it demonstrated that the brain had swollen so much \r\n  that it had actually pressed the blood out and decreased the function of the \r\n  brain.  \r\nExhibits 31, 32, \r\n  and 33 are photos of Joshuaâ€™s abdominal area.  Exhibit 31 shows bruising under \r\n  the skin in the abdominal muscles, and bruises to the soft tissue area.  Exhibit \r\n  31 demonstrates the hemorrhage in the soft tissue in the fatty layer.  Exhibit \r\n  32 shows blood inside the abdomen.  Sexton testified that all of the blood inside \r\n  the abdomen contributed to the cause of death by loss of blood and that the \r\n  blood had come from tears in the messentry (which holds the intestines in) which \r\n  had been torn or separated due to the force of the blows.  Exhibit 33 is a photo \r\n  of the intestine, after it had been removed from Joshua, and demonstrates the \r\n  bruising and areas of the intestine which had separated from the messentry.  \r\n  Sexton also testified that Joshua would have most probably been in pain both \r\n  from the head injuries and the abdominal injuries.  \r\nWe find the above \r\n  photos were properly admitted for the purposes of demonstrating the extent of \r\n  bruising which was not visible from an external review, and they served to corroborate \r\n  the pathologistâ€™s testimony, as well as to prove the existence of the aggravating \r\n  circumstance of physical torture.  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in admitting these photos.\r\nHowever, as to Exhibit \r\n  # 29, the photo of Joshuaâ€™s dilated anus, we find  no legitimate purpose for \r\n  its admission at the sentencing phase of trial.  \r\nAt guilt phase, Dr. Sexton \r\n  noted that Joshuaâ€™s anus was dilated to the extent that he could put three fingers \r\n  in the anus, which was abnormal, but he found no indication of any anal injury, \r\n  and nothing to indicate any sexual assault. \r\n  [2]   He testified that it was not uncommon for the anus to relax and open \r\n  post-mortem.  During his guilt phase closing argument, the solicitor explained \r\n  Sextonâ€™s testimony, noting that Sexton opined you cannot really tell precisely \r\n  when somebody died from taking a rectal temperature.  â€œOne reason you canâ€™t \r\n  tell is because Joshâ€™s rectum, two years old, easily accepts three fingers, \r\n  easily accepts three fingers.  I know some of yaâ€™ll have children.  I donâ€™t \r\n  remember which ones in particular.  I know yâ€™all have seen a rectal thermometer.  \r\n  And I know yâ€™all know that a rectal thermometer is not as big around as three \r\n  fingers.  Sexton told you what that was all about.â€  \r\nAt sentencing, the state \r\n  introduced the photo of Joshuaâ€™s anus, and again asked Sexton, â€œJoshuaâ€™s anus \r\n  easily accepted three fingers, is that correct?â€  Haseldenâ€™s relevancy objection \r\n  was overruled.  On cross-exam, Sexton reiterated that there was no trauma to \r\n  the anus that he could see, and that rectal dilation was not unusual after death.  \r\n\r\nHaselden argues Exhibit 29 \r\n  was simply irrelevant to any issues before the sentencing phase jury and served \r\n  only to inflame the jury and leave them with the impression that, perhaps, Joshua \r\n  had been sexually abused.  We agree.\r\nExhibit 29 did not go to \r\n  the circumstances of the crime, the characteristics of the defendant, nor to \r\n  the existence of aggravating circumstances.  The sole purpose of the photo was \r\n  to insinuate that perhaps there was sexual abuse when, in fact, there was absolutely \r\n  no evidence of such an assault.  We find the extremely prejudicial nature of \r\n  this photograph clearly outweighs any probative value; accordingly, Exhibit \r\n  29 may not be admitted at resentencing. \r\nHaseldenâ€™s murder conviction is affirmed; the case is remanded for \r\n  a new sentencing proceeding. \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    Haselden was divorced and had custody of his \r\n    two children, Felicia and Joshua.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]    The reason for this line of inquiry, at guilt phase, had to do \r\n    with the precise time of Joshuaâ€™s death.  Dr. Sexton testified that Joshuaâ€™s \r\n    rectal temperature in the emergency room was 87 degrees.  The defense was \r\n    attempting to demonstrate that this body temperature indicated that Joshua \r\n    had been dead for quite some time, thereby making it less probable that Haselden \r\n    was the perpetrator of the injuries.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of John Earl Duncan","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-02-07-01","description":"This order reinstates John Earl (Jack) Duncan to the practice of law in South Carolina.","date":"2003-02-18","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of John Earl Duncan, Petitioner.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nOn June 12, 2000, petitioner was \r\n  placed on indefinite suspension.Â  In the Matter of Duncan, 340 S.C. 622, \r\n  533 S.E.2d 894 (2000).Â  Petitioner has now filed a petition for reinstatement.Â  \r\n  The Committee on Character and Fitness recommends the petition be granted.Â  \r\n  We grant the petition and reinstate petitioner to the practice of law in South \r\n  Carolina.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n s/Jean H.

Heckler, \r\n  of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: Appellant John Phillip Corley appeals his commitment pursuant to the South \r\n  Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act (â€œthe SVP Actâ€).  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-48-10 et seq. (2002).  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 1993, a jury convicted appellant of assault \r\n  and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN); he was sentenced to ten \r\n  years.  In August 1993, appellant pled guilty to criminal sexual conduct (CSC) \r\n  in the second degree and was sentenced to 14 years, concurrent.  \r\nShortly before his scheduled release from prison, \r\n  the State filed a petition pursuant to the SVP Act seeking appellantâ€™s commitment \r\n  for long term control, care and treatment.  Prior to trial, appellant moved \r\n  to prevent the details of the ABHAN and CSC convictions from being admitted \r\n  into evidence via the indictments.  He argued that because he would admit to \r\n  the convictions, the details surrounding his prior offenses were not necessary \r\n  and admission of the information would be prejudicial. [1]   The trial court denied the motion.\r\nAt trial, both the Stateâ€™s expert, Dr. Donna Swartz-Watts, \r\n  and appellantâ€™s expert, Dr. Harold Morgan, diagnosed appellant with depression \r\n  and anti-social personality disorder. \r\n  [2]   Both experts also discussed appellantâ€™s past drug abuse.  Dr. Swartz-Watts \r\n  testified it was her opinion that appellant met the SVP Actâ€™s criteria for a \r\n  sexually violent predator.  Dr. Morgan stated that, based on his evaluation \r\n  and diagnoses of appellant, there was a seven to twenty percent likelihood appellant \r\n  would engage in acts of sexual violence if not committed for long-term control, \r\n  care and treatment.  Dr. Morgan noted, however, that if appellant continued \r\n  his treatment for depression, that likelihood would be reduced.\r\nAppellant testified he did not think he was violent \r\n  or dangerous.  He attributed his problems and the assaults to his abuse of crack \r\n  cocaine.\r\nThe jury found the State proved, beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt, that appellant is a sexually violent predator under the SVP Act.  As \r\n  a result, the trial court entered an order committing appellant to the Department \r\n  of Mental Health for his long-term control, care and treatment.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      Did the trial court err by admitting the ABHAN and CSC indictments?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      Does the SVP Act comply with Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002)?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by admitting \r\n  the ABHAN and CSC indictments.  Specifically, he argues that because he was \r\n  willing to stipulate he had previous convictions which triggered the SVP Act, \r\n  there was no legitimate reason to admit the details of the offenses.  We disagree.\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the \r\n  discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.  \r\n  E.g., State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).  Evidence \r\n  is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter \r\n  in controversy.  Rule 401, SCRE.  Relevant evidence may be excluded if the danger \r\n  of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value.  Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE.  In the context of a criminal case, we have noted that while evidence \r\n  of other crimes is generally inadmissible to show criminal propensity or to \r\n  demonstrate that the accused is a bad individual, evidence of other crimes is \r\n  admissible if necessary to establish a material fact or element of the crime \r\n  charged.  See State v. Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 324, 360 S.E.2d \r\n  317, 319 (1987); see also State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, \r\n  156, 526 S.E.2d 228, 230  (â€œwhile generally inadmissible, propensity evidence \r\n  is not prohibitedâ€), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1209 (2000).\r\nUnder the SVP Act, the State bears the \r\n  burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is a sexually violent \r\n  predator.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100 (2002).  A sexually violent \r\n  predator is defined as a person who:  (a) has been convicted of a sexually violent \r\n  offense; and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that \r\n  makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined \r\n  in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1)(a) &amp; (b) (2002).  \r\nPast criminal history is therefore directly relevant \r\n  to establishing section 44-48-30(1)(a).  As such, the State was not required \r\n  to accept appellantâ€™s stipulation.  Cf. Benton, 338 S.C. at 155-56, \r\n  526 S.E.2d at 230 (since evidence of other crimes is admissible to establish \r\n  an element of the crime charged, the appellantâ€™s two prior burglary convictions \r\n  were properly admitted to prove a statutory element of the first degree burglary \r\n  charge; the evidence was not admitted to suggest appellant was a bad person); \r\n  State v. Hamilton, 327 S.C. 440, 486 S.E.2d 512 (Ct. App. 1997) (the \r\n  State could not be forced to stipulate generally to the prior offenses required \r\n  for first degree burglary because such stipulation might cause a substantial \r\n  gap in the evidence needed for the jury to find the defendant guilty of the \r\n  offense), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 904 (1998).\r\nMoreover, appellantâ€™s offer to stipulate to the \r\n  requirement in section 44-48-30(1)(a), with the details of the offenses suppressed, \r\n  would have hampered the Stateâ€™s ability to establish the requirement in section \r\n  44-48-30(1)(b).  The Act defines â€œ[l]ikely to engage in acts of sexual violenceâ€ \r\n  to mean â€œthe personâ€™s propensity to commit acts of sexual violence is \r\n  of such a degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of others.â€  Â§ \r\n  44-48-30(9) (emphasis added).  Therefore, a personâ€™s dangerous propensities \r\n  are the focus of the SVP Act.  \r\nIn the instant case, the State sought to prove \r\n  that appellantâ€™s likelihood to re-offend was based in part upon the fact that \r\n  his previous offenses were similar to one another.  The testimony of the Stateâ€™s \r\n  expert illustrates why evidence regarding the details of the offense was directly \r\n  relevant to the ultimate issue of this case.  Dr. Swartz-Watts testified it \r\n  was important if a personâ€™s past crimes were similar in nature, e.g., similar \r\n  sex, race, and age of the victims.  She testified that where there is similarity, \r\n  it is significant because it evinces a pattern of behavior which in turn indicates \r\n  the person would be at an increased risk to commit future offenses.  In addition, \r\n  Dr. Swartz-Watts stated that appellantâ€™s two victims were similar age, race \r\n  and gender.  Thus, it is clear the details of appellantâ€™s prior offenses found \r\n  in the indictments were relevant to the issue of whether appellant was likely \r\n  to engage in acts of sexual violence again.  Rule 401, SCRE.  Furthermore, we \r\n  note that the details -- as presented in the indictments -- were not unduly \r\n  prejudicial.

Rauch Wise, of Greenwood, for respondent.\r\nSuzanne E. Groff, of Charleston, for amicus curiae. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  McKnight was indicted for homicide \r\n  by child abuse and distribution of cocaine after giving birth to a stillborn \r\n  infant which had benzoylecgonine, a substance metabolized by cocaine, in its \r\n  system.  At the conclusion of the stateâ€™s evidence, the trial court granted \r\n  McKnight a directed verdict on the distribution of crack cocaine charge. [1]   The state appeals the grant \r\n  of a directed verdict to McKnight.\r\nIn State v. Holliday, 255 S.C. 142, 177 S.E.2d 541 (1970), \r\n  this Court recognized limited situations where the state may appeal, stating,\r\n\r\nWhile a limited right of appeal \r\n  in criminal cases has been conferred upon the State by statute in a number of \r\n  jurisdictions, the extent of the right of the prosecution to appeal in this \r\n  jurisdiction has been defined by our judicial decisions.\r\nBased primarily upon the double \r\n  jeopardy provisions of the Constitution, we have long recognized that the State \r\n  has no right of appeal from a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case, \r\n  State v. Lynn, 120 S.C. 258, 113 S.E. 74; unless the verdict of acquittal \r\n  was procured by the accused through fraud or collusion, State v. Johnson, \r\n  248 S.C. 153, 149 S.E.2d 348.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).  Citing State v. Rogers, 198 S.C. 273, 17 S.E.2d \r\n  563 (1941), the Court noted that â€œno writ of error, appeal, or other proceeding \r\n  lies on behalf of the state to review or to set aside a verdict or a judgment \r\n  of acquittal in a criminal case, although there may have been error committed \r\n  by the court, or a perverse finding by the jury.â€  255 S.C. at 145, 177 \r\n  S.E.2d at 542-43.  (Emphasis supplied).  These cases are premised upon the basic \r\n  double jeopardy principle that a defendant in a criminal prosecution is in legal \r\n  jeopardy when he has been placed upon trial under a valid indictment and a competent \r\n  jury has been sworn.  State v. Steadman, 216 S.C. 579, 59 S.E.2d 168 \r\n  (1950). [2] \r\nAccordingly, as there is no right in this state [3]  to appeal the grant of a directed verdict in \r\n  the defendantâ€™s favor, the stateâ€™s appeal is dismissed.\r\n APPEAL DISMISSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]   The jury convicted McKnight of homicide by child abuse, and we affirmed \r\n    that conviction in State v. McKnight, Op. No. 25585 (filed Jan. 27, \r\n    2003)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 3 at 42)(McKnight I).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   The state may appeal an order quashing an indictment, \r\n    State v. Bouknight, 55 S.C. 353, 33 S.E. 451 (1899); State v. Young, \r\n    30 S.C. 399, 9 S.E. 355 (1889), or the grant of a new trial after conviction \r\n    if based on an error of law.  State v. Dasher, 278 S.C. 395, 297 S.E.2d \r\n    414 (1982); State v. DesChamps, 126 S.C. 416, 120 S.E. 491 (1923).  \r\n    These situations, however, involve either a dismissal prior to the jury being \r\n    sworn, or the grant of a new trial following conviction, not an acquittal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   The stateâ€™s reliance on federal caselaw is misplaced.  This \r\n    Court has specifically noted that the stateâ€™s right of appeal is governed \r\n    by statute and caselaw.  State v. Miller, 289 S.C. 426, 346 S.E.2d \r\n    705 (1986)(federal cases cited by appellant concern federal statute and had \r\n    no applicability to state court appeals); State v.

Michael Henthorne, of McNair Law Firm, of Myrtle \r\n  Beach, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  This appeal is from a family court order \r\n  requiring appellant (Husband) to pay child support for his adult disabled child \r\n  and refusing to terminate his alimony payments to respondent (Wife).  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife divorced in 1985.  By consent, a \r\n  modification order was entered in 1987 setting Husbandâ€™s periodic alimony payments \r\n  at $400 per month and child support at $800 per month for their three minor \r\n  children.  As each child reached eighteen, Husband reduced his child support \r\n  payment proportionately.  Finally, in 1995, the youngest child reached eighteen \r\n  and Husband ceased paying child support altogether.\r\nWife commenced this action in 1998 seeking an \r\n  increase in alimony or, in the alternative, child support for Nancy, the partiesâ€™ \r\n  middle child, who turned eighteen in 1993 but still lives with Wife.  Nancy \r\n  is disabled from Leighâ€™s Syndrome, a degenerative metabolic disease with which \r\n  she was diagnosed in 1995.  Nancy first started experiencing problems related \r\n  to her condition sometime in 1993, the year she turned eighteen.  Nancy functions \r\n  on the level of an eight- to ten-year-old and has eye and muscle mobility problems.  \r\n  She also suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and is afraid of strangers.  \r\n  She insists on sleeping in Wifeâ€™s bed and cannot be alone for any significant \r\n  amount of time.  Wife assists Nancy with her daily care including meals, bathing, \r\n  and dressing. \r\nIn response to Wifeâ€™s complaint, Husband counterclaimed \r\n  for a termination or reduction of alimony.  He contested child support on the \r\n  ground Nancy was over eighteen years of age.  \r\nAfter a hearing, the family court reduced Husbandâ€™s \r\n  alimony payment to $150 per month but ordered him to pay child support for Nancy \r\n  in the amount of $553.14 per month, reduced by the amount of his monthly health \r\n  insurance premium for Nancy.  Child support was ordered retroactive to the date \r\n  of filing of Wifeâ€™s complaint. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.\r\n       Does the family court have jurisdiction \r\n  under Â§ 20-7-420(17) to order child support for an adult disabled child who \r\n  has never been emancipated?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.\r\n       Does this section violate equal protection?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       3.\r\n       Did the family court abuse its discretion in refusing \r\n  to terminate alimony?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1. Continuation of child support\r\nThe family courtâ€™s jurisdiction to order child support \r\n  in this case derives from S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(17) (Supp. 2002) which provides:\r\n\r\nThe family court shall have exclusive jurisdiction:\r\n(17) To make all orders of support run until further order of the court, except \r\n  that orders for child support run until the child is eighteen years of age or \r\n  until the child is married or becomes self-supporting, as determined by the \r\n  court, whichever occurs first or to provide for child support past the age of \r\n  eighteen years if the child is in high school and is making satisfactory progress \r\n  toward completion of high school, not to exceed the nineteenth birthday unless \r\n  exceptional circumstances are found to exist or unless there is a preexisting \r\n  agreement or order to provide for child support past the age of eighteen years; \r\n  and in the discretion of the court, to provide for child support past age \r\n  eighteen where there are physical or mental disabilities of the child or other \r\n  exceptional circumstances that warrant the continuation of child support beyond \r\n  age eighteen for as long as the physical or mental disabilities or exceptional \r\n  circumstances continue.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nHusband contends the family court could not order child support in this case \r\n  because Â§ 20-7-420(17) provides only for the â€œcontinuationâ€ of child support \r\n  past eighteen.  Husband claims since Nancyâ€™s disability was not diagnosed before \r\n  she reached eighteen and child support for Nancy had already terminated, the \r\n  family courtâ€™s order was not a â€œcontinuationâ€ of support within the terms of \r\n  the statute.\r\nFirst, medical testimony in the record indicates Nancyâ€™s condition \r\n  is â€œa genetic error of metabolism.â€  Although this condition was not definitively \r\n  diagnosed until she was past eighteen, the fact that it is of genetic origin \r\n  indicates Nancyâ€™s disability was not caused by some event that occurred after \r\n  she reached majority.  It is uncontested that Nancy has never been emancipated.  \r\n  Further, Husbandâ€™s child support obligation was not judicially terminated; Husband \r\n  relied on the presumption of emancipation to terminate payment on his own.\r\nMost jurisdictions recognize a common law duty of parental support for a child \r\n  who has reached majority but is so physically or mentally disabled as to be \r\n  unable to support herself. [1]   \r\n  Where the disability prevents the child from becoming emancipated, the presumption \r\n  of emancipation upon reaching majority is inapplicable.  Parker v. Parker, \r\n  230 S.C. 28, 31, 94 S.E.2d 12, 13 (1956) (emancipation is effected by operation \r\n  of law when a child attains majority unless there is some â€œinfirmity of mind \r\n  or body rendering the child unable to take care of itselfâ€).  \r\n&nbsp;We construe the language of Â§ 20-7-420(17) to be consistent with \r\n  this common law duty and hold the family court is vested with jurisdiction to \r\n  order child support for an unemancipated disabled adult child.  Further, we \r\n  discern the legislatureâ€™s intent that a noncustodial parent share the burden \r\n  of supporting a child who cannot be emancipated because of a disability that \r\n  arose before majority but was diagnosed only after the child turned eighteen.\r\nEmancipation is a factual issue dependent upon the \r\n  circumstances of each case.  Timmerman v. Brown, 268 S.C. 303, 233 S.E.2d \r\n  106 (1977).  In this case, there is no challenge to the fact that Nancy is not \r\n  emancipated.  Further, her disability has prevented her emancipation.  The family \r\n  court therefore had jurisdiction under Â§ 20-7-420(17) to order child support \r\n  in this case. [2] \r\n2.  Equal \r\n  protection\r\nHusband contends the underscored language of Â§ 20-7-420(17) violates \r\n  equal protection because a married parent has no legal obligation to support \r\n  a disabled adult child and therefore a divorced parent cannot constitutionally \r\n  be ordered to support such a child. [3]   This issue is without merit.  Equal protection \r\n  essentially requires that all those similarly situated are treated alike.  City \r\n  of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985).  As we \r\n  construe it, Â§ 20-7-420(17) treats divorced parents the same as all other parents \r\n  regarding support for an unemancipated disabled adult child.  We find no equal \r\n  protection violation.\r\n3.  Alimony\r\nThe family court reduced Husbandâ€™s monthly alimony \r\n  obligation from $400 per month to $150 per month, a reduction of about 62%.  \r\n  Husband contends alimony should have been terminated, rather than reduced, because \r\n  of Wifeâ€™s increased financial ability.\r\nThe modification of alimony is within the sound discretion of the \r\n  family court and will not be overturned absent an abuse thereof.  Thornton \r\n  v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 492 S.E.2d 86 (1997).  A modification of alimony \r\n  must be based on a substantial or material change in circumstances.  Sharps \r\n  v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 535 S.E.2d 913 (2000).  In addition to the changed \r\n  circumstances of the parties, the financial ability of the supporting spouse \r\n  to pay is a specific factor to be considered.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985).    \r\n\r\nAlthough both parties have increased income, Wife still earns substantially \r\n  less than Husband.  Wifeâ€™s original earnings were 22% of Husbandâ€™s; Wife now \r\n  earns 37% of Husbandâ€™s income. [4] \r\n    The family court found Wifeâ€™s increased income justified a reduction in \r\n  alimony but properly considered Wifeâ€™s continued custodial care of Nancy in \r\n  refusing to terminate it.  Cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(9) (Supp. \r\n  2002) (in making award of alimony, family court must consider custody of children).  \r\n  In light of the substantial reduction in alimony ordered by the family court, \r\n  Husband has failed to show an abuse of discretion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHusbandâ€™s remaining issues are without merit and \r\n  we dispose of them pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR.  See Issue IV:  Smith \r\n  v. Smith, 275 S.C. 494, 272 S.E.2d 797 (1980); Hatfield v. Hatfield, \r\n  327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997) (issue must be raised to and ruled \r\n  on by family court to be preserved for review); and Issue V:  Glasscock \r\n  v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991) (beneficial result a factor \r\n  to be considered in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees).  The order of the family court \r\n  is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] See \r\n    Streb v. Streb, 774 P.2d 798 (Alaska 1989); Towery v. Towery, \r\n    685 S.W.2d 155 (Ark. 1985); Nelson v. Nelson, 548 A.2d 109 (D.C. 1988); \r\n    Pocialik v. Fed. Cement Tile Co., 97 N.E.2d 360 (Ind.

Van Tinker, 229 P.2d \r\n    333 (Wash. 1951).   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Husband also argues the award of child support was not in Nancyâ€™s best interest \r\n    because she will lose benefits such as Social Security Income and medicaid.  \r\n    The record indicates an administrative law judge has ruled that the child \r\n    support payments do not make Nancy ineligible for Social Security Income.  \r\n    Although there is speculation in the record that Nancyâ€™s eligibility for other \r\n    government programs may be affected, it is mere speculation.  This issue is \r\n    without merit.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] This \r\n    issue was not raised to the family court.  The issue of a statuteâ€™s constitutionality \r\n    may be raised for the first time on appeal, however, where the statute determines \r\n    subject matter jurisdiction.  State v. Keenan, 278 S.C. 361, 296 S.E.2d \r\n    676 (1982).  Because Â§ 20-7-420 determines the family courtâ€™s subject matter \r\n    jurisdiction, Amisub of South Carolina, Inc. v. Passmore, 316 S.C. \r\n    112, 447 S.E.2d 207 (1994), this issue is properly before us. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] At the time of the 1987 consent \r\n    order setting alimony at $400 per month, Wife was earning $12,000 to 13,000 \r\n    per year.  The family court found her current income to be $4,091 per month, \r\n    or $49,092 per year, from her salary as an accountant, investment income, \r\n    and part-time work.  At the time the parties divorced, Husband earned $56,000 \r\n    to 58,000 per year.  The family court found he now earns $11,066 per month, \r\n    or $132,792 per year.

McCulloch, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\nJ. Neil Robinson, of Charlotte, and Leo A. Dryer, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\nG. Dewey Oxner, Jr. and Moffatt G. McDonald, of Greenville; R. Ray Dennis, \r\n  of Spartanburg; Stanley T. Case and Edward G. Smith, of Spartanburg; and Thomas \r\n  E. McCutchen and Hoover C. Blanton, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  Walker Scott Russell (â€œScottâ€) \r\n  and Mildred Neiman (â€œMimâ€), collectively â€œAppellantsâ€, each filed Summons and \r\n  Complaints in the Spartanburg County Probate Court seeking to set aside the \r\n  Last Will and Testament of their father, Donald S. Russell, Sr. (â€œTestatorâ€), \r\n  and seeking to set aside the Revocable Trust and Irrevocable Trust of Testator. \r\n  Appellants contend both the will and the trust instruments resulted from undue \r\n  influence exerted on Testator.  Wachovia Bank (â€œWachoviaâ€), Executor of Testatorâ€™s \r\n  estate and trustee of both trusts, as well as the other Defendants, moved for \r\n  summary judgment, which was granted.  These appeals followed. \r\n  [1]   We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nTestator was married to Virginia U. Russell (â€œMrs. \r\n  Russellâ€) and they had four children, Donald Russell, Jr. (â€œDonnieâ€), Mim, John \r\n  Russell (â€œJohnnyâ€) and Scott.  Mim married Thad Williams (â€œThadâ€) and had three \r\n  children, Russell Williams (â€œRussellâ€), Virginia Williams (â€œVirginiaâ€) and Cecilia \r\n  Williams (â€œCeciliaâ€), collectively â€œThe Williams Children.â€  Mim and Thad divorced, \r\n  and Mim married Leonard Neiman  in June of 1997.  \r\nTestator served as an active United States Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit \r\n  until his death on February 22, 1998, at the age of 92.  Prior to his appointment \r\n  to the federal bench, Testator served as a governor of and United States senator \r\n  from South Carolina, as well as President of the University of South Carolina.  \r\n  Testatorâ€™s physical condition deteriorated in his later years, and he was occasionally \r\n  hospitalized.\r\nThe Williams Children lived with Testator and his wife for most of their lives.  \r\n  Cecilia lived in the home until Testatorâ€™s death, while Russell and Virginia \r\n  resided in the home intermittently.  \r\nTestator executed many \r\n  wills, codicils, and trusts beginning in 1959.    His final will and trusts \r\n  were executed on February 27, 1996, with codicils executed on May 15, 1996, \r\n  November 6, 1996, October 9, 1997, and November 6, 1997.  The last codicil was \r\n  executed on February 20, 1998, just two days before his death.  Testatorâ€™s estate \r\n  totaled 33 million dollars.  \r\nTestatorâ€™s final estate plan provided that his estate be held in trust for \r\n  Mrs. Russell for her lifetime, and at her death the trust property be distributed \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       (1)\r\n       $750,000 to Scott in trust for life, if he is not living then \r\n  to Scottâ€™s spouse and descendants then living, also in trust.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (2)&nbsp;\r\n       One-third of the balance to Donnie.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (3)&nbsp;\r\n       One-third of the balance to Johnny.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (4)&nbsp;\r\n       The remaining one-third of the balance to Mim and her three \r\n  children, the Williams Children, as follows:\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      a.\r\n       One-fourth to Mim in trust for life, and then to \r\n  the Williams Children in trust for life.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      b.\r\n       One-fourth to Virginia in trust for life.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      c.\r\n       One-fourth to Cecilia in trust for life.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      d.\r\n       One fourth to Russell in trust for\r\n        life.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nMim is to receive only the income from her trust, but the trustee has the discretion \r\n  to distribute principal. At Mimâ€™s death, the property remaining in the trust \r\n  shall be divided per stirpes into trusts for Mimâ€™s descendants living at the \r\n  time of her death.  The Williams Children receive distributions of principal \r\n  and income at the sole discretion of the trustee.  The Williams Children are \r\n  to have a power of appointment over their trusts through their wills, and cannot \r\n  appoint the trust property to their estates or to creditors. If the Williams \r\n  Children do not exercise their powers of appointment, their shares are divided \r\n  per stirpes into trusts for their descendants living at the time of their death.  \r\n\r\nAppellants contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment \r\n  against them.  Since our standard of review requires we review the evidence \r\n  in the light most favorable to Appellants, Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. \r\n  488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002), we recount from the record the evidence supporting \r\n  their claims of undue influence by the Williams Children and their father Thad.  \r\n\r\nAppellants presented evidence, that at times, Testator was confused.  One incident \r\n  in 1997, detailed by several nurses employed by Testator, involved Testator \r\n  thinking that he was in Richmond, Virginia, when in fact he was in Spartanburg, \r\n  South Carolina.  The nurses also stated that Testator â€œdoubled upâ€ on his medication, \r\n  which caused them to regulate the medication Testator took, and put a lock on \r\n  the medicine cabinet.  \r\nThere was evidence that the Williams Children were disrespectful to Testator, \r\n  and frequently yelled at Testator about money.  The Williams Children engaged \r\n  in physical fights in front of Testator. There was evidence that Cecilia monitored \r\n  Testatorâ€™s telephone calls while he was in his home, and sometimes told Testator \r\n  which clothes to wear.  Cecilia would not allow Testator to regulate the thermostat \r\n  in his house.  \r\nThe Williams Children spent large amounts of Testatorâ€™s money, sometimes charging \r\n  as much as $12,000 in a month.  The Williams Children had unfettered access \r\n  to Testatorâ€™s office, and lived in his house.  There was evidence that Thad [2]  had frequent contact with Testatorâ€™s attorney \r\n  regarding the estate plans.  Two medical doctors testified that Testator could \r\n  have been susceptible to undue influence.  Finally, there was evidence that \r\n  Russell and Cecilia removed records from Testatorâ€™s office on the weekend of \r\n  his death. [3]   \r\nThere is, however, undisputed evidence that the Testator was mentally competent \r\n  and worked until the day he died.  Testator drove himself to work every day.  \r\n  At the direction of Testator, his secretary, not the Williams Children or Thad, \r\n  handled Testatorâ€™s financial transactions.  Testator frequently attended social \r\n  engagements with Donnie and Johnny, as well as other friends and colleagues.  \r\n  There is also undisputed evidence that Mim has not provided for her own children, \r\n  the Williams Children, in her estate plan.  Finally, Testator met with his attorney \r\n  alone on most occasions, and neither the Williams Children, nor Thad were present \r\n  at the signing of the will, trust documents or codicils.           \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nDid the trial judge err in granting summary judgment because a  genuine issue \r\n  of material fact existed concerning the exercise of undue influence over the \r\n  Testator in the execution of his will?\r\nDid the trial judge err in failing to make a specific ruling that North Carolina \r\n  law governed the validity vel non of the trust documents?\r\nDid the trial judge err in granting summary judgment because a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact existed concerning the validity of Testatorâ€™s trusts due to \r\n  undue influence or lack of trust res?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will Contest\r\nAppellants argue that Testatorâ€™s entire estate plan is void ab initio \r\n  due to undue influence exerted by the Williams Children as well as by Thad Williams, \r\n  their father, and that summary judgment was inappropriate as there was a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact.  We disagree.\r\nAll parties stipulate that South Carolina law governs the will contest.  For \r\n  a will to be invalidated for undue influence, the influence must be the kind \r\n  of mental coercion which destroys the free agency of the creator and constrains \r\n  him to do things which are against his free will, and that he would not have \r\n  done if he had been left to his own judgment and volition. Last Will and \r\n  Testament of Smoak v. Smoak, 286 S.C. 419, 334 S.E.2d 806 (1985). Undue \r\n  influence must be shown by unmistakable and convincing evidence, which is usually \r\n  circumstantial. Id. The evidence must show that the free will of the \r\n  testator was taken over by someone acting on testatorâ€™s behalf.  Id.   \r\n  Undue influence is demonstrated where the will of the influencer is substituted \r\n  for the will of the maker.  Id.\r\nGenerally, in cases where a will has been set aside for undue influence, there \r\n  has been evidence either of threats, force, and/or restricted visitation, or \r\n  of an existing fiduciary relationship.  Hembree v. Estate of Hembree, \r\n  311 S.C. 192, 428 S.E.2d 3 (Ct. App. 1993).  The â€œmere existence of influence \r\n  is not enough to vitiate a Willâ€¦A mere showing of opportunity and even a showing \r\n  of motive to exercise undue influence does not justify a submission of that \r\n  issue to a jury, unless there is additional evidence that such influence was \r\n  actually utilized.â€  Last Will and Testament of Smoak, supra, \r\n  at 424, 334 S.E.2d at 809.  Where the testator has an unhampered opportunity \r\n  to revoke a will or codicil subsequent to the operation of undue influence upon \r\n  him, but does not change it, the court as a general rule considers the effect \r\n  of undue influence destroyed.  Smith v. Whetstone, 209 S.C. 78, 39 S.E.2d \r\n  127 (1946), as quoted in Estate of Cumbee, supra.  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to \r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP.  When \r\n  reviewing a summary judgment order, an appellate court applies the same standard \r\n  as the trial court.  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).  \r\n  â€œThe evidence, and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most \r\n  favorable to the non-moving party.â€ Id. at 494, 567 S.E.2d at 860.  Since \r\n  the standard of proof in an undue influence case is unmistakable and convincing \r\n  evidence, there must be more than a scintilla of evidence in order to defeat \r\n  a motion for summary judgment. Id.  A heightened standard for summary \r\n  judgment is required where â€œthe inquiry involved in a ruling on a motion for \r\n  summary judgmentâ€¦necessarily implicates the substantive evidentiary standard \r\n  of proof that would apply at a trial on the merits.â€   George v. Fabri, \r\n  345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001) quoting Anderson v. Liberty \r\n  Lobby, Inc. 477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).  \r\nTaking the facts in the light most favorable to the Appellants, \r\n  we agree with the trial judge that there is no genuine issue of material fact \r\n  to preclude the grant of summary judgment as to the validity of the will. Appellants \r\n  have not presented unmistakable and convincing evidence that the Williams Children \r\n  or Thad utilized their relationship with Testator to substitute their will for \r\n  his.  The evidence presented points to the conclusion that the Williams Children \r\n  were churlish, spoiled children, who took advantage of Testatorâ€™s generosity.   \r\n  While unattractive, such conduct and demeanor does not amount to undue influence.  \r\n\r\nIn previous cases, this Court has found no undue influence \r\n  existed where the evidence was similar in degree to that presented by Appellants.  \r\n  See, e.g., Calhoun v. Calhoun, 277 S.C. 527, 290 S.E.2d \r\n  415 (1982) (Testator was confined to a nursing home, in feeble physical condition, \r\n  yet continued to conduct business affairs three years after the signing of the \r\n  will.  Beneficiary drove testator to the attorneyâ€™s office, but was not present \r\n  at the signing of the will. Case should not have gone to the jury because no \r\n  undue influence.); Last Will and Testament of Smoak, supra, (Testator \r\n  was bedridden, and beneficiaryâ€™s attorney drafted the will. Directed verdict \r\n  should have been granted because no evidence of undue influence.); \r\n  [4]  First Citizens Bank v. Inman, 296 S.C. 8, 370 S.E.2d 99 (1988) \r\n  (Testator was in reasonably good health, worked in her yard, spoke with her \r\n  neighbors and did some cooking.  Testator â€œexhibited a pattern of changing her \r\n  will over the yearsâ€¦she went through a consistent procedure of talking with \r\n  her lawyerâ€¦it appears she was the ultimate decision maker.â€  Directed verdict \r\n  was proper.)  \r\nWhere undue influence has been found, the facts have been \r\n  far more egregious than those in this situation.  See, Estate of Cumbee, \r\n  supra (Testatorâ€™s conversations were monitored by beneficiaries through \r\n  a baby monitor, and testator developed hand signals to communicate with her \r\n  visitors.  The beneficiary controlled the testatorâ€™s finances, and gave the \r\n  directions for the new will to the attorney, picked up the will, and had the \r\n  will executed in the home of the beneficiary.); Byrd v. Byrd, 279 S.C. \r\n  425, 308 S.E.2d 788 (1983) (Testator was infirm, both physically and mentally, \r\n  prior to and contemporaneously with the execution of the will.  The beneficiary \r\n  threatened to send the testator to a nursing home, and visitation was severely \r\n  restricted by the beneficiary. The will was voided for undue influence.) \r\n Here, it is undisputed that Testator was independent, and physically mobile \r\n  until a few days before his death.  Testator, while elderly, was not infirm, \r\n  mentally or physically, and was not prevented from seeing relatives, friends \r\n  or business associates.  \r\nIn order for the will to be void due to undue influence, â€œ[a] contestant must \r\n  show that the influence was brought directly to bear upon the testamentary act.â€  \r\n  Mock v. Dowling, 266 S.C. 274, 277, 222 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1976).  The \r\n  record is devoid of any evidence that the Williams Children or Thad influenced \r\n  the execution or any modification of the will.  Neither the Williams Children \r\n  nor Thad were present when the contents were discussed, or when the will was \r\n  executed.  The circumstances surrounding the will indicate the will was the \r\n  product of the free and unfettered act of Testator.  \r\nAppellants argue that two expert witnesses, both medical doctors, testified \r\n  that Testator was subject to undue influence, and that this testimony is enough \r\n  to withstand summary judgment.  We disagree.  Neither of the experts examined \r\n  the Testator. Both experts testified that Testator was competent to execute \r\n  a will.  Absent examination of Testator by the expert, or an opinion that Testator \r\n  was mentally incompetent and therefore more susceptible to undue influence, \r\n  we fail to see how expert medical testimony can be probative as to undue influence.  \r\n  Further, neither expert based his opinion on the circumstances surrounding the \r\n  execution of the Will, which is the critical issue when evaluating an undue \r\n  influence case. â€œHad his expert testimony related to mental capacity it might \r\n  have properly been considered on that issue.â€  Smoak v. Smoak, 286 S.C. \r\n  419, 427, 334 S.E.2d 806, 810 (1985).  The doctorsâ€™ testimony here did not, \r\n  and therefore does not preclude summary judgment.\r\nTestator had numerous opportunities to change the will after executing it in \r\n  1996.  In fact, Testator did amend his estate plan multiple times.  The undisputed \r\n  evidence to the effect that Testator drove his own car, worked, and met alone \r\n  with his attorney [5]  while executing \r\n  the will, is evidence of the â€œunhampered opportunityâ€ to change his will, which \r\n  negates any undue influence evidence that the Appellants put forth.  Smith \r\n  v. Whetstone, supra.\r\nWhen opposing a summary judgment motion, the nonmoving party must do more than \r\n  â€œsimply show that there is a metaphysical doubt as to the material facts but \r\n  must come forward with â€˜specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue \r\n  for trial.â€™â€  Baughman v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 306 \r\n  S.C. 101, 107, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).  Where a verdict is not â€œreasonably \r\n  possible under the facts presented, summary judgment is proper.â€  Bloom \r\n  v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 529 S.E.2d 710 (2000) (emphasis added).  In this \r\n  case, the trial judge properly granted summary judgment on the undue influence \r\n  claim relating to the will.  A judgment for Appellants was not reasonably possible \r\n  under the facts presented when measured against the level of unmistakable and \r\n  convincing proof.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Carolina Law\r\nAppellants argue that North Carolina law applies to \r\n  the trust documents.  We agree.  The trust documents specifically provide for \r\n  the application of North Carolina law.  Both trusts state, â€œ[t]he situs of this \r\n  trust shall be the State of North Carolina, and the administration and construction \r\n  of the trust, and the rights of the beneficiaries hereof, shall be governed \r\n  by the laws of the State of North Carolina.â€  As to interests in personal property \r\n  held in testamentary or living trusts, a testator may designate the local law \r\n  to govern the validity of the trust unless application of the designated law \r\n  would be contrary to public policy of the state of testatorâ€™s domicile at death. \r\n  Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws Â§Â§ 268-270 (1971).

Â§ 62-7-202 (1987) (suggests the settlor can \r\n  designate in the trust instrument the principal place of administration of the \r\n  trust).  Further, the designated state must have a substantial relation to the \r\n  trust. Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws Â§Â§ 268-270.  â€œA state \r\n  has a substantial relation to the trust when it is the state, if any, which \r\n  the settlor designated as that in which the trust is to be administered, or \r\n  that of the place of business or domicil of the trustee at the time of the creation \r\n  of the trust, or that of the location of the trust assets at that time, or that \r\n  of the domicil of the settlor, at that time, or that of the domicil of beneficiaries.  \r\n  There may be other contacts which will likewise suffice.â€  Restatement (Second) \r\n  of Conflict of Laws Â§270 cmt. b.  \r\nIn this case, the Testator \r\n  [6]  designated that North Carolina law should apply, and the trustee as \r\n  well as the trust property are located in North Carolina.  There is a substantial \r\n  relationship between the trust and North Carolina.  We hold that a settlor may \r\n  designate the law governing his trust, and absent a strong public policy reason, \r\n  or lack of substantial relation to the trust, the choice of law provision will \r\n  be honored.  North Carolina law applies to Testatorâ€™s trusts.    \r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust Contest\r\n\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Undue Influence\r\n\r\nAppellants argue that the trusts are invalid due to undue \r\n  influence by the Williams Children and/or Thad.  Under North Carolina law, which \r\n  is similar to South Carolina law, undue influence requires that: \r\n\r\nthere must be something operating upon the mind of the person \r\n  whose act is called in judgment, of sufficient controlling effect to destroy \r\n  the free agency and to render the instrument, brought into question, not properly \r\n  an expression of the wishes of the maker, but rather the expression of the will \r\n  of another.  It is the substitution of the mind of the person exercising the \r\n  influence for the mind of the testator, causing him to make a will which he \r\n  otherwise would not have made.  \r\n\r\nIn re Will of Andrews, 261 S.E.2d 198, 199 (N.C. \r\n  1980).  \r\nUndue influence must be proved by the greater weight \r\n  of the evidence.  Id.  The Appellants must â€œcarry their burden of presenting \r\n  specific evidence that [Testatorâ€™s] will was the result of â€˜overpoweringâ€™ and \r\n  â€˜fraudulent influenceâ€™ exerted by [the Williams Children and/or Thad] which \r\n  overcame [Testatorâ€™s] will.â€  Estate of Whitaker, 547 S.E.2d 853, 858 \r\n  (N.C. Ct. App. 2001).  \r\n          There are several factors that the North \r\n  Carolina courts look to in determining whether undue influence was exerted over \r\n  the testator. In re Will of Andrews, supra.  â€œThe test for determining \r\n  the sufficiency of the evidence of undue influence is usually stated as follows: \r\n  (i)t is generally proved by a number of facts, each one of which, standing alone, \r\n  may have little weight, but taken collectively may satisfy a rational mind of \r\n  its existence.â€ Id. at 200.  Analyzing the North Carolina factors one-by-one \r\n  it is apparent that summary judgment was proper:  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (1)&nbsp;\r\n       Old age and physical and mental weakness.  Appellants \r\n  presented evidence that Testator was an elderly man who occasionally showed \r\n  signs of physical and mental weakness. \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (2)&nbsp;\r\n      The person signing the paper is in the home of the beneficiary \r\n  and subject to his constant association and supervision.  Appellants contend \r\n  the Williams Children lived in the home of Testator.  However, evidence that \r\n  a beneficiary lived with the Testator must be coupled with evidence of constant \r\n  association and supervision.  Appellants presented no evidence that Testator \r\n  was subject to the Williams Childrenâ€™s constant supervision or association and \r\n  admit that Testator was free to leave the house, drove himself to work everyday, \r\n  and freely associated with other friends, family members, and colleagues.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (3)&nbsp;\r\n      Others have little or no opportunity to see him.  There \r\n  is no evidence to support this factor. \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (4)&nbsp;\r\n      The will is different from and revokes a prior will.   \r\n  Appellants presented evidence that the Williams Children were not included in \r\n  any of the estate plans previous to the 1996 plan and contended Testator intended \r\n  to treat his children equally. However, Testator had never treated his children \r\n  equally in previous estate plans.  Beginning in 1981, Scott received a specific \r\n  bequest, which increased substantially in all of the subsequent revisions, including \r\n  the one executed two days before Testatorâ€™s death, which increased Scottâ€™s trust \r\n  share from $500,000 to $750,000.  Although the Williams Children were not included \r\n  in the previous wills, there was evidence that Mim had disinherited the Williams \r\n  Children, and that Testator changed his estate plan to make sure they were provided \r\n  for.  Also, there was evidence that Testator did not approve of Mimâ€™s marriage \r\n  to Neiman, and wanted to insure Mimâ€™s bequest passed to her children, and not \r\n  to Neiman.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (5)&nbsp;\r\n      It is made in favor of one with whom there are no ties of \r\n  blood. This element is not applicable, as the Williams Children are the \r\n  grandchildren of the Testator.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (6)&nbsp;\r\n      It disinherits the natural objects of his bounty. This \r\n  element is also not applicable.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (7)&nbsp;\r\n      The beneficiary has procured its execution.    \r\n  Appellants presented evidence that Thad arranged for the execution of the documents, \r\n  and was heavily involved in the entire process.  However, the Appellants presented \r\n  no evidence that Thad, or the Williams Children, were present at the execution \r\n  of any of the documents, nor that they procured the execution.  Also, \r\n  Thad is not a beneficiary of the estate plan. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAnalyzing North Carolina jurisprudence, and applying \r\n  these factors in the light most favorable to the Appellants, there is no evidence \r\n  to make out a prima facie case of undue influence under North Carolina \r\n  law. [7]   Appellants presented evidence of the first factor, â€œ[b]ut \r\n  evidence of mental or physical condition standing alone is not evidence of undue \r\n  influence.â€  In re Ballâ€™s Will, 33 S.E.2d 619, 621 (N.C. 1945).  The \r\n  only other evidence Appellants presented was that the will was different from \r\n  prior wills.  There is no specific evidence of an â€œoverpoweringâ€ or â€œfraudulent \r\n  influenceâ€ exerted over Testator, therefore the  summary judgment motion was \r\n  proper and we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling.  Estate of Whitaker, supra.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust Res\r\n\r\nScott argues that the trust was not funded at its creation, \r\n  and therefore was not validly created.  We disagree.  There is sufficient evidence \r\n  that the trusts were funded.  Testator expressed an intent to create a trust, \r\n  designated beneficiaries and a trustee, and funded the trust.  &quot;In order \r\n  to create an enforceable trust it is necessary that the donor or creator should \r\n  part with his interest in the property to the trustee by an actual conveyance \r\n  or transfer, and, where the creator has legal title, that such title should \r\n  pass to the trustee.&quot;  Tyson v. Henry, 514 S.E.2d 564, 565 (N.C. \r\n  Ct. App. 1999).  Under the Restatement (Second) of Trusts, â€œ[i]f  the \r\n  owner of property executes an instrument purporting to transfer to another in \r\n  trust such property as he may designate thereafter, the conveyance is incomplete \r\n  and no trust arises unless and until he designates and transfers the property.â€  \r\n  Â§26 cmt. e (1959) (emphasis added).    There is evidence that a ten dollar bill \r\n  was attached to the trust documents when Testator executed the documents.  â€œThe \r\n  trust agreement obviously may precede the transfer of title, as well as occur \r\n  at the time of the transfer.â€ George Gleason Bogert, Trusts and Trustees, \r\n  Â§ 141, 10 (2d ed., West 1979).  \r\nEven if Testator did not fund the trust at the moment \r\n  the documents were signed, the trusts were funded as of March 21, 1997, one \r\n  year prior to Testatorâ€™s death, as evidenced by a partnership agreement.  See, \r\n  e.g. Burbridge v. First Nat. Bank and Trust Co. of Oklahoma City, \r\n  415 P.2d 591 (OK 1965) (No property or assets were listed in the trust agreement \r\n  or attached thereto as exhibits.  The trust did not become operative as to any \r\n  of the settlorâ€™s assets when the trust agreement was drawn up, but only later \r\n  when property was specifically transferred and delivered to the trustee by the \r\n  settlor.)   We therefore conclude that all of the required elements for the \r\n  formation of a trust were met. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the order of the circuit court judge \r\n  granting summary judgment on the will under South Carolina law.  \r\nWe hold that North Carolina law applies to the issues surrounding \r\n  the trust documents.  Under North Carolina law, Appellants presented no evidence \r\n  that would give rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to their undue influence \r\n  claim and Respondents are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.  \r\n  Finally, we hold that the trust was validly funded.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, J., and Acting Justices John W. Kittredge \r\n  and Perry M. Buckner, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Appellantsâ€™ actions were consolidated for purposes \r\n    of discovery and trial, and have remained consolidated on appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  After receiving his law degree, Thad Williams \r\n    earned a Master of Law in Taxation from New York University.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Although Appellants tout this as a major indication \r\n    of undue influence, the records were immediately sent to Wachovia, and the \r\n    Testator authorized the removal of the records.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The standard for summary judgment â€œmirrors the \r\n    standard for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a).â€  Baughman v. American \r\n    Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 \r\n    (1991).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  We note that Testatorâ€™s counsel served as President \r\n    of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  Donald S. Russell, Sr. continues to be referenced \r\n    as â€œTestatorâ€ for consistency, notwithstanding that we discuss the validity \r\n    of trust instruments.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]   Following is an example of a \r\n    case, with facts far more favorable to a contestant than the one at hand, \r\n    in which it was held that a prima facie case was not presented. In \r\n    Matter of Will of Prince, 425 S.E.2d 711, 714 (N.C. Ct. App. \r\n    1993), the North Carolina Court of Appeals held that the evidence presented \r\n    was insufficient to warrant submission of the issue of undue influence to \r\n    a jury. \r\n  The caveator presented evidence that the testatrix was old and at times suffered \r\n    with memory loss; that the propounder, the testatrix's brother, assisted testatrix \r\n    with her affairs; that the propounder's former daughter-in-law made an appointment \r\n    for the testatrix with the attorney; and that the propounder drove the testatrix \r\n    to see her attorney and sat in the conference she had with her attorney. The \r\n    caveator also presented evidence that the testatrix did not make provisions \r\n    in her will for her son and her two grandchildren; that on occasions the testatrix \r\n    expressed to others that she was afraid of the propounder; and that the propounder \r\n    was a beneficiary under the will. In holding that such evidence was insufficient \r\n    to support an inference of undue influence, [the court] stated that the evidence \r\n    â€œfails â€˜to support an inference that the will was the result of an overpowering \r\n    influence exerted by propounder of testatrix which overcame testatrix's free \r\n    will and substituted for it the wishes of propounder, so that testatrix executed \r\n    a will that she otherwise would not have executed.â€™â€ \r\n  In the Matter of Estate of Whitaker, 547 S.E.2d 853, 858 (N.C.

Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  Curtis Gibbs (â€œGibbsâ€) pleaded \r\n  guilty to driving under suspension (second) and to uttering a fraudulent check \r\n  of more than $500.  For DUS, Gibbs was sentenced to six months imprisonment \r\n  and a fine of $500, provided upon payment of $200, the balance was to be suspended \r\n  with probation for two months.  For the fraudulent check conviction, Gibbs was \r\n  sentenced to eight years imprisonment and a fine of $1,000.  The sentence was \r\n  to be suspended with probation for two years provided Gibbs paid restitution \r\n  of $618.28, with at least $200 of the restitution to be paid by June 25, 2000.\r\nGibbs filed a notice of appeal.  The State commenced a probation \r\n  revocation action after Gibbs failed to report to the probation officer, and \r\n  failed to pay the $200 restitution due on June 25th.  Gibbs argued \r\n  that the State could not proceed with probation revocation because his sentences \r\n  were automatically stayed pending the conclusion of the appeal.  The State contended \r\n  the sentences were not automatically stayed and that to obtain a stay, Gibbs \r\n  was required to post an appeal bond pursuant to Rule 230(a), SCACR.  The trial \r\n  court held the sentences were automatically stayed pending appeal, without the \r\n  filing of an appeal bond.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  State v. Gibbs, \r\n  346 S.C. 355, 550 S.E.2d 908 (Ct. App. 2001).  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition \r\n  for writ of certiorari to review this decision, and reverse.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that a sentence \r\n  of confinement suspended to probation is automatically stayed pending appeal, \r\n  without the necessity of filing an appeal bond?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSouth Carolina Appellate Court Rule 230(a) states that \r\n\r\n[t]he service of a notice of appeal by a criminal defendant shall operate as \r\n  a stay of the execution of the sentence until the appeal is finally disposed \r\n  of; provided, however, a sentence of confinement shall not be stayed until the \r\n  defendant has posted bail under S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 18-1-80 and -90 (1985)â€¦\r\n\r\n The issue then is whether Gibbs received a sentence of confinement within \r\n  the meaning of Rule 230(a) SCACR.  We hold that he did.  \r\nGibbs received a sentence of eight years imprisonment for the fraudulent check \r\n  conviction, and a sentence of six months imprisonment for the DUS conviction, \r\n  each of which were suspended upon the fulfillment of certain conditions.  Both \r\n  of these sentences were sentences of â€œconfinementâ€ even though the committed \r\n  portions were suspended by the trial court judge under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 \r\n  (Supp. 2001).  Simply put, a sentence of confinement is no less so because it \r\n  is suspended. [1]   \r\nThe Court of Appeals held in State v. Gibbs, supra, that â€œ[t]he \r\n  sentences did not require Gibbs to be confined and, therefore, the filing of \r\n  the notice of intent to appeal alone was sufficient to stay the sentences.  \r\n  Thus, we conclude that Gibbsâ€™s [sic] sentences were stayed pending appeal without \r\n  the necessity of an appeal bond being filed.â€ We disagree. The Court of Appeals \r\n  erroneously focused on Gibbsâ€™ status at the time of the appeal as an \r\n  â€œunconfined probationerâ€ rather than the actual sentence that he received.  \r\n  Although Gibbsâ€™ confinement was suspended to probation, he was appealing â€œsentences \r\n  of confinement.â€ Rule 230(a), SCACR.  [2]   \r\nRule 230(a), SCACR is drawn from the S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 18-1-70 [3]  and -80. \r\n  [4]    The statutes distinguish between a defendant who receives a fine \r\n  and a defendant who receives a sentence of confinement.  The statutes do not \r\n  require a defendant who is sentenced to pay a fine to post a bond while his \r\n  appeal is being decided, because that, in essence, would require that the defendant \r\n  comply with his monetary sentence before his appeal is decided.  However, a \r\n  defendant who receives a prison term must post bond for a different reason:  \r\n\r\n\r\n[t]he primary purpose of bail in a criminal case is to relieve the accused \r\n  of imprisonment, and the state of the burden of keeping him, pending the trial \r\n  (or pending appeal), and at the same time, to put the accused as much under \r\n  the power of the court as if he were in the custody of the proper officer, and \r\n  to secure the appearance of the accused so as to answer the call of the court \r\n  and do what the law may require of him. \r\n\r\nE.H. Schopler, Appealability of Order Relating to Forfeiture of Bail, \r\n  78 A.L.R.2d 1180, 1181 (1961).  \r\nThe practical effect is that an appeal bond relieves the State of the cost \r\n  of supervising the probationer, perhaps unnecessarily, during the appeal process.  \r\n  At the same time the sentenced defendant remains â€œâ€¦as much under the power of \r\n  the court as if he were in the custody of the proper officerâ€¦.â€  The distinction \r\n  in Rule 230(a), SCACR, drawn from the statutes, is between sentences that are \r\n  fines and those that are confinement, not sentences that are suspended to probation \r\n  and those that are not.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals.  Gibbs was given two sentences of confinement, therefore, \r\n  the circuit court erred in holding that Gibbsâ€™ probationary sentence should \r\n  have been stayed pending appeal without Gibbs having to post an appeal bond.  \r\n  We remand the case to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this \r\n  opinion.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   â€œA rose is a rose is a rose is a roseâ€¦â€ Gertrude \r\n    Stein, Sacred Emily in Selected Writings of Gertrude Stein (Vintage \r\n    Books, 1990).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The sentencing sheet for Gibbsâ€™ DUS (second) charge \r\n    states â€œ[w]herefore, the Defendant is committed to the State Department of \r\n    Corrections for a determinate term of  six  monthsâ€¦â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  â€œIn criminal cases service of notice of appeal \r\n    in accordance with law shall operate as a stay of the execution of the sentence \r\n    until the appeal is finally disposed of.â€  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  â€œPending such appeal the defendant shall still \r\n    remain in confinement until he give bail in such sum and with such sureties \r\n    as to the court shall deem proper.â€  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Will T.
