Watson, Post-Conviction \r\n  Relief Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25573\r\nSubmitted November 21, 2002 - Filed January \r\n  13, 2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\nAND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHarry Leslie Devoe, Jr., of New Zion, for petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General \r\n  John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, Jr., and \r\n  Assistant Attorney General William Bryan Dukes, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this petition \r\n  for a writ of certiorari to determine whether the post-conviction relief (PCR) \r\n  court erred by finding petitionerâ€™s claim was inappropriate for PCR.  We reverse \r\n  and remand for a hearing.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner pled guilty to conspiracy to traffic in marijuana and was sentenced \r\n  to imprisonment for seven years.  A direct appeal was not filed.  Thereafter, \r\n  petitioner filed a PCR application, which was dismissed after a hearing.  We \r\n  granted his petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nAt the hearing to determine whether petitioner was entitled to an evidentiary \r\n  hearing on his PCR claim, the State moved to dismiss his application because \r\n  it was filed after the statutory one-year filing period had expired.  Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  counsel argued that petitioner did not discover his claim until he was informed \r\n  by the Department of Corrections that he was parole ineligible.  While in prison, \r\n  petitioner was initially treated as if he was parole eligible and had a parole \r\n  hearing.  Petitioner filed his PCR application immediately upon learning of \r\n  his parole ineligible status.  The PCR court denied the Stateâ€™s motion to dismiss \r\n  based upon the statute of limitations.\r\nAs to the merits of the claim, petitioner alleged counsel \r\n  had advised him, prior to his plea, that he would be parole eligible.  The PCR \r\n  court dismissed petitionerâ€™s claim regarding parole eligibility as being improper \r\n  for PCR.  The court found the claim should be resolved via the Department of \r\n  Correctionsâ€™ internal grievance system.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err by finding petitionerâ€™s claim should be determined by \r\n  the Department of Corrections under Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, \r\n  527 S.E.2d 742 (2000)?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn Al-Shabazz, supra, we held that, except for two non-collateral \r\n  matters specifically listed in the PCR Act, \r\n  [1]  PCR is a proper avenue of relief only when the applicant mounts \r\n  a collateral attack challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence.  \r\n  We stated a claim regarding sentence-related credits or other condition of imprisonment \r\n  does not fall into this category.  Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 367-368, 527 \r\n  S.E.2d at 749.  The avenue of relief for these latter claims is the Department \r\n  of Correctionsâ€™ internal grievance system.  Id. at 371-373, 527 S.E.2d \r\n  at 751-752.\r\nThe PCR court incorrectly concluded that petitionerâ€™s \r\n  claim was an Al-Shabazz claim that can only be resolved in the Department \r\n  of Correctionsâ€™ internal grievance system.  We find his claim is appropriate \r\n  for PCR because he alleges that counsel was ineffective for improperly advising \r\n  him that he would be parole eligible.  His understanding about his parole eligibility \r\n  may have affected the validity of the underlying plea.  See Al-Shabazz, \r\n  supra (PCR is a proper avenue of relief when applicant mounts collateral \r\n  attack challenging validity of his conviction or sentence).  An evidentiary \r\n  hearing is warranted to determine if counsel was in fact ineffective.  See, \r\n  e.g., Frasier v. State, 351 S.C. 385, 570 S.E.2d 172 (2002) (PCR \r\n  court held evidentiary hearing to determine whether applicant was induced to \r\n  plead guilty based on counselâ€™s parole advice prior to plea; PCR courtâ€™s decision \r\n  denying relief because counsel did not give any advice as to parole eligibility \r\n  affirmed); Hinson v. State, 297 S.C. 456, 377 S.E.2d 338 (1989) (held \r\n  applicant established attorneyâ€™s advice regarding parole eligibility constituted \r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel); Griffin v. Martin, 278 S.C. 620, \r\n  300 S.E.2d 482 (1983) (upheld PCR courtâ€™s decision that applicant failed to \r\n  prove his attorneyâ€™s erroneous advice concerning parole eligibility induced \r\n  his guilty plea).\r\nHowever, petitioner did not file his claim within one \r\n  year after his conviction as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (Supp. \r\n  2001). [2]   It would appear that this section \r\n  bars petitionerâ€™s claim; however, we conclude his claim falls within the discovery \r\n  rule, which provides:\r\n\r\nIf the applicant contends that there is evidence of \r\n  material facts not previously presented and heard that requires vacation of \r\n  the conviction or sentence, the application must be filed under this chapter \r\n  within one year after the date of actual discovery of the facts by the applicant \r\n  or after the date when the facts could have been ascertained by the exercise \r\n  of reasonable diligence.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(C) (Supp. 2001).\r\nPetitioner was allegedly informed by his counsel and \r\n  was informed by the Department of Corrections that he was eligible for parole.  \r\n  The Department even conducted a parole hearing for petitioner in 1999.  A few \r\n  months later, the Department informed him he was not parole eligible.  When \r\n  he finally received the correct information, he learned he had a claim of ineffective \r\n  assistance of counsel based on counselâ€™s allegedly erroneous parole eligibility \r\n  advice.  Petitioner filed his PCR application raising that claim within one \r\n  year after the date of actual discovery of the fact he was parole ineligible.  \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the PCR court and remand this matter for an evidentiary \r\n  hearing on the merits of petitionerâ€™s claim regarding counselâ€™s mistaken advice \r\n  that petitioner would be eligible for parole.  Cf. Tilley v. State, \r\n  334 S.C. 24, 511 S.E.2d 689 (1999) (fourth PCR application, challenging guilty \r\n  plea as involuntary on ground applicant did not know he was parole ineligible, \r\n  not successive where applicant could not have raised claim in previous application \r\n  because he previously did not know he was parole ineligible).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] The non-collateral matters that can be heard in the PCR setting \r\n    are the claims that an applicantâ€™s sentence has expired and that an applicantâ€™s \r\n    probation, parole, or conditional release has been unlawfully revoked.  S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(5) (1985). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Petitioner pled guilty in March 1997, but did not file \r\n    his PCR application until October 1999. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25574","title":"Bowen v.

Fuge, P.A., of Beaufort, \r\n  for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this writ \r\n  of certiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals properly held that the \r\n  presumption of a resulting trust should not be applied to the acquisition of \r\n  land where Husband and Wife had an antenuptial agreement.  Bowen v. Bowen, 345 S.C. 243, 547 S.E.2d 877 (Ct. App. 2001).  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nPROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\nPreviously, respondent (Wife) brought a divorce \r\n  action against petitioner (Husband).  The family court upheld Husbandâ€™s and \r\n  Wifeâ€™s antenuptial agreement and held that four jointly titled properties acquired \r\n  during the marriage were non-marital properties in which Wife had a one-half \r\n  interest.  The Court of Appeals vacated the portion of the family court order \r\n  that addressed the partiesâ€™ respective interests in the properties because the \r\n  family court did not have jurisdiction over non-marital property.  Bowen \r\n  v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 490 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nWife then sought a declaratory \r\n  judgment that she was the owner of an undivided one-half interest in the four \r\n  properties.  The matter was referred to the Beaufort County Master-in-Equity, \r\n  who found for Wife.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  We granted \r\n  Husbandâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in May 1985, and \r\n  were granted a divorce in 1994.  Prior to their marriage, they entered into \r\n  an antenuptial agreement in an attempt to predetermine the financial consequences \r\n  of any later separation, divorce, or death, and to preserve each partyâ€™s separate \r\n  property.  The pertinent language from this agreement follows:\r\n\r\n          3.  All property owned or income earned or \r\n  accumulated by either of the parties at the time of their marriage or which \r\n  the parties may acquire, earn or accumulate hereafter, or during their \r\n  marriage, from any source whatever shall be the separate property of the respective \r\n  party now owning, earning, accumulating or hereafter acquiring such property, \r\n  free and clear of any rights, interest, claims or demands of the other . . .\r\n          5.  . . .[E]ach party specifically waives any and \r\n  all right of claim [sic] that such party may at any time have to take any share \r\n  of the property of the other party under any circumstances whatsoever, with \r\n  the same force and effect as though single persons before any marriage.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nDuring the marriage, four \r\n  parcels of land were purchased and titled in both Husbandâ€™s and Wifeâ€™s names.  \r\n  Lot 270, Haig Point, and Lot 365, Haig Point, were conveyed by third parties \r\n  to Husband and Wife â€œfor and during their joint lives and upon the death of \r\n  either of them, then to the survivor of them, his or her heirs or assigns.â€  \r\n  Townhouse Unit #7, Gangplank Pointe, and Lot 336, Waterâ€™s Edge, were conveyed \r\n  by third parties to Husband and Wife â€œas tenants by the entirety, with the right \r\n  of survivorship.â€\r\nWife did not make any financial contribution to the \r\n  purchase of the properties, nor did she pay for any expenses in relation to \r\n  the properties.  However, Wife and Husband together borrowed part of the purchase \r\n  price for Lot 365, Haig Point. [1]   Wife and Husband also signed \r\n  for a line of credit that was ultimately used for the down payment on the Townhouse \r\n  property.\r\nWife testified Husband never informed her she was \r\n  holding the properties in her name for him.  She also testified that, while \r\n  Husband had not explicitly so stated, she believed her interest in the properties \r\n  were gifts from Husband.\r\nHusband testified he never intended to make a gift \r\n  of an undivided one-half interest in the properties to Wife, but instead had \r\n  the properties jointly titled as an estate planning device.  He did not recall \r\n  telling Wife that he intended her to hold the properties for him and they were \r\n  to be his sole property or that he did not intend to give her one-half interests \r\n  in the properties. \r\nThe Master-in-Equity found \r\n  Wife was entitled to a one-half interest in the net proceeds from the four disputed \r\n  properties and that she owed one-half of all expenses incurred in keeping the \r\n  properties, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance of the funds to which \r\n  the properties were converted. [2]   The Master found Husband had \r\n  made a gift to Wife of a one-half interest in the properties.  The Master found \r\n  the antenuptial agreement did not alter the result because â€œ[n]othing in the \r\n  antenuptial agreement prevent[ed] [Husband] from being more generous than he \r\n  contracted to be.â€ \r\nThe Court of Appeals held \r\n  that because Husband and Wife had a clear understanding of their respective \r\n  rights involving property acquired by each during the marriage, via the antenuptial \r\n  agreement, it was unnecessary to employ the resulting trust or gift presumptions \r\n  to determine those property rights.  The Court of Appeals looked to the plain \r\n  language of the agreement to give effect to the intentions of Husband and Wife \r\n  and held that Wife had acquired a one-half interest in the four properties.  \r\n  Bowen, 345 S.C. at 250-251, 547 S.E.2d at 881.\r\nAs for Husbandâ€™s contention \r\n  that the Master erred by finding he intended to make a gift to Wife of an interest \r\n  in the disputed properties, the court held that, while there was sufficient \r\n  evidence in the record to sustain such a factual finding, it was unnecessary \r\n  to address that issue.  Id. at 251, 547 S.E.2d at 881.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the presumption of a \r\n  resulting trust should be applied to the acquisition of land where Husband and \r\n  Wife agreed in their antenuptial agreement to be treated as unmarried persons?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHusband claims the court should have treated he and Wife as single persons, \r\n  as their agreement required, and imposed a resulting trust on the properties \r\n  in his favor.\r\nEquity devised the theory of resulting trust to effectuate \r\n  the intent of the parties in certain situations where one party pays for property, \r\n  in whole or in part, that for a different reason is titled in the name of another.  \r\n  Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248-249, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  472, 475 (1997) (citing McDowell v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Servs., \r\n  296 S.C. 89, 370 S.E.2d 878 (Ct. App. 1987)).  The general rule is that when \r\n  real estate is conveyed to one person and the consideration paid by another, \r\n  it is presumed that the party who pays the purchase money intended a benefit \r\n  to himself, and accordingly a resulting trust is raised in his behalf.  Id. \r\n  at 249, 489 S.E.2d at 475.  The presumption, however may be rebutted and the \r\n  actual intention shown by parol evidence.  Id.        \r\nBut when the conveyance is taken to a spouse or child, \r\n  or to any other person for whom the purchaser is under legal obligation to provide, \r\n  no such presumption attaches.  Id.  On the contrary, the presumption \r\n  in such a case is that the purchase was designated as a gift or advancement \r\n  to the person to whom the conveyance is made.  Id. at 249, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  at 475-476 (citing Lollis v. Lollis, 291 S.C. 525, 354 S.E.2d 559 (1987)).  \r\n  This presumption, however, is one of fact and not of law and may be rebutted \r\n  by parol evidence or circumstances showing a contrary intention.  Id. \r\n  at 249, 489 S.E.2d at 476 (citing Legendre v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, \r\n  215 S.C. 514, 56 S.E.2d 336 (1949)).\r\nAs the Court of Appeals properly noted, â€œin situations \r\n  in which there is no clear understanding between the parties as to the ownership \r\n  of conveyed property,â€ the competing legal presumptions of a resulting trust \r\n  and a gift between spouses generally arise.  However, in this case, Husband \r\n  and Wife entered into an antenuptial agreement which provides that Husband and \r\n  Wife would be treated as if they were unmarried persons in relation to property \r\n  and which expressly states that all property that the parties may acquire during \r\n  the marriage from any source whatever shall be the separate property of the \r\n  respective party.  Because Husband and Wife had a clear understanding as to \r\n  the ownership of conveyed property according to the antenuptial agreement, the \r\n  presumptions are inapplicable.\r\nThe agreement restricted each spouseâ€™s right to acquire \r\n  an ownership interest in the otherâ€™s separate property, but it did not address \r\n  a spouseâ€™s right to jointly title newly acquired property.  Although Husband \r\n  paid the entire purchase price for each of the properties, he chose to allow \r\n  the properties to be jointly titled.  If Husband had desired the four properties \r\n  to be his separate property upon a divorce, pursuant to their antenuptial agreement, \r\n  he should have had the properties conveyed and titled in his name alone.  Under \r\n  the terms of the agreement, the land, which was purchased with Husbandâ€™s separate \r\n  funds, would have remained his separate property had he not chosen to have the \r\n  properties jointly titled.  Treating the parties as â€œsingle persons before [the] \r\n  marriageâ€ as required under the antenuptial agreement, Wife acquired her interests \r\n  in the properties by holding title with Husband.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals properly affirmed the Masterâ€™s \r\n  findings that Wife owned an undivided one-half interest in the four properties \r\n  and that Wife owed one-half of all expenses in keeping the properties.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] \r\n    However, Wife did not contribute to the loan payments. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] All four properties have been sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25575","title":"Cunningham v.

Helping Hands, Inc., 346 S.C. 253, 550 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nHelping Hands is a charitable organization that operates \r\n  a childrenâ€™s shelter in Aiken, South Carolina.  At the time of her accident, \r\n  respondent, Lora Cunningham (Cunningham), was a fifteen-year-old resident of \r\n  Helping Hands.\r\nOn September 8, 1996, Lieutenant Frank Conoly, a Department \r\n  of Public Safety officer, brought a fire truck to Helping Hands so the children \r\n  could see and climb onto the fire truck.  When he arrived, two staff members \r\n  of Helping Hands, John Heos and Lanita Battle, brought between six and ten teenagers \r\n  to view the truck.  The teenagers were allowed to climb on the truck and some, \r\n  including Cunningham, were allowed to sit inside the truck.  After approximately \r\n  thirty minutes, Conoly asked the children to â€œstand clearâ€ because he had to \r\n  leave.  Before leaving, he walked completely around the truck to ensure that \r\n  all the children were standing clear.\r\nAs Conoly began to leave, Cunningham jumped onto the \r\n  passenger side running board of the truck.  Prior to her action, some other \r\n  teenagers had also boarded the truck.  As the truck drove away, Cunningham became \r\n  frightened and either jumped or slipped from the truck, and fell under the rear \r\n  wheels.  She stated she got on the truck, knowing Conoly would be driving away \r\n  and that she should not be on the moving truck, because she wanted to ride for \r\n  a short distance and then jump off.\r\nCunningham stated Conoly was the first person to assist \r\n  her after she was injured.  At the time she fell, she did not remember any of \r\n  the Helping Hands staff being present, and the last time she remembered an adult, \r\n  other than Conoly, being present was about ten to fifteen minutes prior to the \r\n  accident.  Conoly testified John Heos went inside shortly before he left.\r\nMonica Brown, a teenager present at the time, testified \r\n  that when Conoly began to leave, she told those on the truck to get off before \r\n  they got hurt.  She also stated that Heos knocked on the window from inside \r\n  the building and told the children to get off the fire truck.  At the time of \r\n  the accident, Brown testified there were no staff members outside.  Another \r\n  teenager, Maurice Kelly, corroborated this fact.  Brown testified that, previously, \r\n  Battle had been outside while the children were at the fire truck.  Kelly testified \r\n  Heos and a female staff member periodically checked on them while they were \r\n  outside with the truck.\r\nBattle testified that when she went inside the building \r\n  to use the restroom, Heos remained outside with the children.  While answering \r\n  a telephone call, Monica Brown ran in and said that Cunningham had been hit. \r\n\r\nHeos testified that, initially, he, Battle, and possibly \r\n  another staff member, were outside with the children; however, he did not stay \r\n  outside the whole time because he had to assist a girl inside.  He then watched \r\n  the children from the window inside the building.  He stated he did not know \r\n  for sure if any staff members were outside after he went inside.\r\nHeos testified that when Conoly began to leave he saw \r\n  that two boys were hanging on the back of the truck.  He jumped up to tell them \r\n  to get off of the truck.  From the window, he did not see Cunningham right away, \r\n  but saw her hanging off the side of the truck as it made a circle.\r\nPrior to the accident, Heos testified he had seen children \r\n  hanging on moving vehicles and that he had seen Cunningham jump out in front \r\n  of the moving fire truck previously that day.\r\nAt the time of Cunninghamâ€™s placement at Helping Hands, \r\n  Helping Hands knew that Cunningham had been evaluated for oppositional defiant \r\n  disorder [1]  and had to take \r\n  Prozac and Ritalin.  Battle testified that a few weeks before Cunninghamâ€™s accident, \r\n  Cunningham had overdosed on possibly Ritalin or aspirin and had to be supervised \r\n  for a week following the overdose.\r\nRegarding the responsibilities of Helping Handsâ€™ staff, \r\n  both Heos and Battle testified that they were familiar with Helping Handsâ€™ personnel \r\n  manual on policy and procedure.  The manual indicated that, as part of the staffâ€™s \r\n  responsibilities, the staff must ensure client safety and supervise clients \r\n  at all times, and that staff are expected to take breaks only when it will not \r\n  interfere with the daily routine of the children, supervision, or activities \r\n  of the children.\r\nAs a result of her injuries from the accident, Cunningham \r\n  brought a claim of negligence against Helping Hands.  Before trial, Helping \r\n  Hands moved for summary judgment on the ground that Cunninghamâ€™s actions were \r\n  the sole cause of her injuries.  The trial court granted the motion, finding \r\n  that Cunningham had assumed the risk of injury.  The trial court noted that \r\n  because Cunninghamâ€™s action arose and accrued prior to this Courtâ€™s opinion \r\n  in Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Prop. Regime, 333 S.C. \r\n  71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998), [2]  the case was governed by the common law principles \r\n  of assumption of risk existing prior to Davenport.  The trial court found \r\n  Cunninghamâ€™s assumption of the risk acted as a complete bar to recovery without \r\n  regard to any comparative standard of fault.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  granting Helping Handsâ€™ motion for summary judgment because a question of fact \r\n  existed as to whether Cunningham assumed the risk of her injury.  The court \r\n  concluded that, â€œ[e]ven if there is evidence that Cunningham assumed the risk \r\n  of her injury, that evidence is not sufficient to warrant judgment as a matter \r\n  of law given Helping Handsâ€™ duty to supervise its charges.â€\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether Helping Hands was entitled to summary judgment based upon \r\n  Cunninghamâ€™s assumption of the risk under pre-Davenport common law?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Conner \r\n  v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002); Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP.  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist for summary \r\n  judgment purposes, the evidence and all the inferences that can be reasonably \r\n  drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.  Id.  Moreover, since it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment \r\n  should be cautiously invoked so that a litigant will not be improperly deprived \r\n  of trial on disputed factual issues.  Id.\r\nSecondary implied assumption of risk, as exists in the \r\n  instant case, arises when the plaintiff knowingly encounters a risk created \r\n  by the defendantâ€™s negligence.  Davenport, 333 S.C. at 82, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  at 571.  â€œIt is a true defense because it is asserted only after the plaintiff \r\n  establishes a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant.  \r\n  Secondary implied assumption of the risk may involve either reasonable or unreasonable \r\n  conduct on the part of the plaintiff.â€  Id.\r\nPrior to the Davenport opinion, there were four \r\n  requirements to establish the defense of assumption of risk:  (1) plaintiff \r\n  must have knowledge of the facts constituting a dangerous condition; (2) plaintiff \r\n  must know the condition is dangerous; (3) plaintiff must appreciate the nature \r\n  and extent of the danger; and (4) plaintiff must voluntarily expose himself \r\n  to the danger.  The doctrine is predicated on the factual situation of a defendantâ€™s \r\n  acts alone creating the danger and causing the accident, with the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  act being that of voluntarily exposing himself to such an obvious danger with \r\n  appreciation thereof which resulted in the injury.  Davenport, 333 S.C. \r\n  at 78-79, 508 S.E.2d at 569 (citation omitted).  Assumption of risk may be implied \r\n  from the plaintiffâ€™s conduct.  Id.\r\nWe conclude the trial court improperly granted Helping \r\n  Handsâ€™ motion for summary judgment because the evidence presented did not establish \r\n  the defense of assumption of risk as a matter of law.  No evidence was presented \r\n  to establish that Cunningham appreciated the nature and extent of the danger \r\n  of riding on the side of the fire truck.  The evidence also does not show that \r\n  Cunningham in fact knew the condition was dangerous. \r\n  [3]   \r\nTherefore, because the evidence does not clearly establish \r\n  the defense of assumption of risk, the trial court erred by granting the motion \r\n  for summary judgment.  See Conner v. City of Forest Acres, supra \r\n  (summary judgment is drastic remedy that should be cautiously invoked so litigant \r\n  will not be improperly deprived of trial on disputed factual issues); Strange \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways and Pub. Transp., 307 S.C. 161, 414 \r\n  S.E.2d 138 (1992) (assumption of risk is generally factual question to be determined \r\n  by jury).\r\nWhile the Court of Appeals reached the correct result \r\n  by finding the summary judgment motion should not have been granted, we disagree \r\n  with its analysis.  The Court of Appeals, while finding the case was governed by the common law as it existed prior to the Davenport \r\n  decision, held that the defense of assumption of risk was unavailable to Helping \r\n  Hands because it had an enhanced duty to supervise and protect Cunningham at \r\n  all times.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reached this conclusion by extending \r\n  the rule set out in Bramlette v. Charter-Medical-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, \r\n  393 S.E.2d 914 (1990).  In Bramlette, this Court held that where a duty \r\n  exists to prevent a patient from committing suicide, the very suicide, which \r\n  the defendant has the duty to prevent, cannot constitute assumption of the risk \r\n  as a matter of law.  See also Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. \r\n  361, 429 S.E.2d 190 (1993) (same) (hereinafter referred to as the Bramlette \r\n  rule).  The Court of Appeals found the Bramlette rule to be applicable \r\n  in the instant case â€œbecause Helping Hands had a duty to supervise Cunningham \r\n  at all times and its breach of that duty may have caused her injury.â€  However, \r\n  we have not extended the Bramlette rule beyond the factual situation \r\n  of Bramlette and Hoeffner and we decline to extend it here.\r\nThe specific duty of a health professional to prevent \r\n  the suicide of a person who is known by the health professional to be suicidal \r\n  is very different from a group homeâ€™s general duty to supervise a child in its \r\n  care.  Unlike the health professionals in Bramlette and Hoeffner, \r\n  Helping Hands did not have a specific duty to prevent the very act by which \r\n  Cunningham was injured, nor did it have specific notice that Cunningham was \r\n  likely to commit such an act.  Therefore, the defense of assumption of risk \r\n  may apply in this case.\r\nIn conclusion, while the Court of Appeals improperly \r\n  extended the Bramlette rule, we find the court reached the right result \r\n  by reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision granting Helping Handsâ€™ motion for summary \r\n  judgment.  Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as modified.  \r\n  Further, we vacate the portion of the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion concerning the \r\n  issue of comparative negligence. [4] \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] \r\n    A clinical psychologist stated, by affidavit, \r\n    that the essential feature of the disorder is a recurrent pattern of negativistic, \r\n    defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior towards authority figures.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] \r\n    In Davenport, we held the absolute defense of assumption \r\n    of risk is inconsistent with the stateâ€™s comparative negligence system.  We \r\n    further held the Davenport ruling would apply to all causes of action \r\n    accruing after November 9, 1998, the date of the opinion.  Because the accident \r\n    in this case occurred on September 8, 1996, the law of assumption of risk \r\n    as it existed prior to Davenport is the applicable law. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] We also \r\n    find that the evidence presented did not establish Helping Hands was not negligent \r\n    as a matter of law.  According to the Helping Handsâ€™ personnel manual, the \r\n    staff is required to ensure client safety and supervise the clients at \r\n    all times.  The manual further states that the staff is not allowed to \r\n    take a break if it would interfere with the supervision of the children.  \r\n    The staff of Helping Hands may have failed to adequately supervise Cunningham \r\n    on the day of the accident.  When Conoly readied to leave, allegedly no staff \r\n    members were present with the children.  However, this determination of negligence \r\n    is a question of fact for the jury.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] \r\n    The Court of Appeals unnecessarily addressed this issue \r\n    by elevating the trial courtâ€™s footnote on a hypothetical situation as a trial \r\n    court â€œruling.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25576","title":"McLaughlin v.

We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was convicted of trafficking in cocaine, possession with intent \r\n  to distribute (PWID) cocaine, and two counts of PWID cocaine within proximity \r\n  of a school.  He was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment for trafficking, \r\n  fifteen years concurrent for PWID cocaine, and ten years concurrent for each \r\n  count of PWID within proximity of a school.  His convictions and sentences were \r\n  affirmed on direct appeal.  State v. McLaughlin, 307 S.C. 19, 413 S.E.2d \r\n  819 (1992).\r\nISSUE \r\n  I\r\n\r\nWhether the PCR court erred by \r\n  finding respondent was incompetent to stand trial?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe \r\n  State argues the PCR court erred by finding respondent was incompetent to stand \r\n  trial due to the effects of his anti-seizure medication, Dilantin.\r\nWhile respondent chose not to testify at his PCR \r\n  hearing, his father (Father) and sister (Sister) testified that respondentâ€™s \r\n  health problems began when he was a teenager.  They testified respondent acted \r\n  strangely, had migraine headaches, mood swings, and was depressed.  Father did \r\n  not attend the trial, but he testified that, prior to trial, respondent was \r\n  acting strangely.  He indicated he had spoken with respondentâ€™s counsel about \r\n  respondentâ€™s problems.\r\nShortly before respondent was arrested, Sister stated \r\n  he began taking Dilantin, which made him depressed, disoriented, confused, and \r\n  caused mood swings.  Sister indicated she was present with respondent before \r\n  and during the trial, and that respondent acted strangely and had mood swings.  \r\n  Sister testified respondent did not have any problems communicating with counsel \r\n  during trial.  However, she indicated respondent did not understand counsel \r\n  when counsel attempted to discuss the terms of an offered plea agreement.\r\nNancy Culbertson, a pharmacist, testified on respondentâ€™s \r\n  behalf at the PCR hearing.  She testified the side effects of taking Dilantin \r\n  include confusion, mood and mental changes, cognitive impairment, depression, \r\n  and mental incompetency.\r\nCulbertson indicated she had reviewed respondentâ€™s \r\n  medical records from the Department of Corrections.  From the review, she determined \r\n  respondent exhibited various physical side effects after taking Dilantin.  Culbertson \r\n  testified that respondentâ€™s taking of Dilantin could have affected his ability \r\n  to make rational decisions.  She felt that, from reading the trial testimony, \r\n  respondent could not adequately handle his day-to-day affairs.  However, she \r\n  testified that she could not tell whether respondent was in fact taking Dilantin \r\n  at the time of trial. [1]   \r\n  Further, on cross-examination, Culbertson admitted she was not qualified to \r\n  examine someone to determine if that person was competent to stand trial and \r\n  she admitted she did not know the standard for determining whether someone is \r\n  competent to stand trial.\r\nFrom our review of respondentâ€™s trial testimony, \r\n  respondent clearly understood the questions he was asked and responded to the \r\n  questions in an appropriate manner.  At no time did respondent indicate he did \r\n  not understand what counsel was asking him.   \r\nRespondentâ€™s trial counsel testified that he had \r\n  no trouble communicating with respondent.  As a result of knowing that respondent \r\n  was taking Dilantin and had been treated for seizures, counsel had him evaluated \r\n  before trial by a forensic psychiatrist to determine his competency.  The psychiatrist \r\n  did not find any indications that respondent was incompetent.  In an effort \r\n  to provide mitigation in sentencing, counsel informed the trial court that, \r\n  according to respondentâ€™s evaluation, respondentâ€™s medical conditions did not \r\n  interfere with his mental state. \r\nThe PCR court found respondent incompetent at the \r\n  time of trial, and stated â€œit is clear that [respondent], at the \r\n  time of his trial was mentally impaired because \r\n  of his seizure condition; his medication and its adverse effects.â€  (Emphasis \r\n  in original).\r\nDue process prohibits the conviction of a person \r\n  who is mentally incompetent.  Jeter v. State, 308 S.C. 230, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  594 (1992).  The test for competency to stand trial or continue trial is whether \r\n  the defendant has the sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer \r\n  with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational, \r\n  as well as a factual, understanding of the proceedings against him.  State \r\n  v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. \r\n  1077, 119 S.Ct. 816, 142 L.Ed.2d 675 (1999).  The defendant bears the burden \r\n  of proving his incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence.  Id.\r\nThe evidence does not suggest that respondent was \r\n  incompetent before or during his trial.  As noted previously, the pharmacist \r\n  was not qualified to determine competency and did not know the standard for \r\n  determining competency to stand trial.  The pharmacist also could not determine \r\n  from the records in her possession whether respondent was even taking the medicine \r\n  at the time of his trial. \r\nAdditionally, the Department of Correctionsâ€™ medical \r\n  records are of little probative value because they commence after the completion \r\n  of respondentâ€™s trial and they do not directly relate to respondentâ€™s ability \r\n  to consult with his counsel or to understand the proceedings.  Further, none \r\n  of the physical side effects respondent appeared to exhibit from Dilantin during \r\n  his time in prison would seem to have any effect on his capacity to understand \r\n  counsel or the trial proceedings.\r\n \r\nFrom counselâ€™s PCR testimony that he had no trouble \r\n  communicating with respondent and from a review of respondentâ€™s trial testimony, \r\n  it is clear respondent had the ability to â€œconsult with his lawyer with a reasonable \r\n  degree of rational understanding.â€  See State v. Kelly, supra.  \r\n  During his trial testimony, respondent answered his counselâ€™s questions, and \r\n  those of the prosecution, clearly and appropriately.\r\nFurther, given the fact a forensic psychiatrist evaluated \r\n  respondent prior to trial and found that his medical conditions did not affect \r\n  his mental state, the PCR court erred by granting respondent relief on this \r\n  ground.  We reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision granting respondent relief on the \r\n  basis he was not competent at the time of trial.  See Gilchrist v. \r\n  State, 350 S.C. 221, 565 S.E.2d 281 (2002) (Court will not uphold PCR courtâ€™s \r\n  findings if no probative evidence supports those findings).\r\nISSUE \r\n  II\r\n\r\nWhether the PCR court erred by \r\n  finding counsel ineffective for failing to preserve for appeal the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  refusal to allow counsel to cross-examine the SLED chemist regarding his drug \r\n  arrest? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAt trial, the State offered the testimony of a \r\n  former SLED chemist to testify that the substance found in respondentâ€™s possession \r\n  was cocaine and to state the weight of that cocaine.  After the State presented \r\n  the chemistâ€™s qualifications, counsel voir dired the witness outside the juryâ€™s \r\n  presence.  He immediately began questioning the chemist regarding his arrest \r\n  the Friday before the trial began.\r\nThe chemist testified he \r\n  was arrested for possession of cocaine and misconduct in office.  When asked \r\n  specific details about his arrest, the chemist declined to answer.  He also \r\n  refused to answer whether he had ever analyzed drugs while under the influence \r\n  of cocaine during his tenure at SLED. \r\nCounsel requested that he \r\n  be allowed to ask the chemist questions regarding his arrest in the juryâ€™s presence \r\n  because the arrest affected whether the chemist was qualified to be an expert \r\n  in the case.  The trial court found the chemistâ€™s arrest did not affect his \r\n  qualifications as a chemist, and subsequently ruled the chemist was qualified \r\n  as an expert.  The trial court also refused to allow counsel to cross-examine \r\n  the chemist regarding his arrest.  However, the court allowed counsel to ask \r\n  the chemist whether he was impaired at the time of the cocaine testing and whether \r\n  the test on the cocaine in respondentâ€™s case was compromised by the chemistâ€™s \r\n  use of cocaine. \r\nOn cross-examination of \r\n  the chemist, counsel did not ask the permitted questions.  Following cross-examination, \r\n  the trial court made it clear on the record that counsel had chosen not to ask \r\n  the permitted questions.  Counsel indicated he had proffered the questions he \r\n  proposed to ask.  In light of the courtâ€™s ruling on that proffer, counsel stated \r\n  he decided that to ask only the allowed questions would be unwise because it \r\n  would isolate the testimony with respect to the test and would not have the \r\n  same effect as if he were also allowed to ask questions about the chemistâ€™s \r\n  arrest.\r\nOn direct appeal, respondent \r\n  appealed the trial courtâ€™s limitations on cross-examining the chemist.  We ruled \r\n  the issue was not properly preserved for review on appeal.  State v. McLaughlin, \r\n  supra. [2] \r\nAt the PCR hearing, trial \r\n  counsel was questioned regarding his failure to cross-examine the chemist regarding \r\n  his drug use.  Counsel stated that once the trial court limited the questions \r\n  he could ask of the chemist, he felt that to ask the permitted questions would \r\n  not have advanced the case.  Counsel thought the fact the chemist had an unrelated \r\n  charge for cocaine possession would not have necessarily helped respondent, \r\n  but it was something he would have liked to have explored.\r\nThe PCR court held counsel \r\n  should have made a proffer and asked the permitted questions.  The court stated \r\n  that if the issue had been properly preserved, it would have resulted in a new \r\n  trial. \r\nTo prove counsel was ineffective, \r\n  a PCR applicant must show counselâ€™s performance was deficient and the deficient \r\n  performance caused prejudice to the applicantâ€™s case.  Strickland v. Washington, \r\n  466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).  To show prejudice, the \r\n  applicant must show that, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability \r\n  the result of the trial would have been different.  Johnson v. State, \r\n  325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).  A reasonable probability is a probability \r\n  sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.  Strickland, \r\n  supra.\r\nWe find counsel was not deficient for failing to \r\n  make a proffer because counsel in fact made a proffer.  We further find counsel \r\n  was not deficient for failing to ask the specific questions allowed by the trial \r\n  court.  Counsel gave a valid reason for consciously deciding not to ask those \r\n  questions.  See Whitehead v. State, 308 \r\n  S.C. 119, 417 S.E.2d 529 (1992) (if counsel articulates valid reason for employing \r\n  certain trial strategy, such tactics will not be deemed ineffective assistance \r\n  of counsel).  Counsel stated that to ask the questions regarding whether \r\n  the chemist was impaired while performing the test on the cocaine or whether \r\n  the test on the cocaine was compromised by the chemistâ€™s use of cocaine would \r\n  not have greatly aided respondentâ€™s defense unless he could have laid the foundation \r\n  for those questions by placing the chemistâ€™s arrest before the jury.\r\nMoreover, respondent has not shown that there is \r\n  a reasonable probability the result of his trial would have been different.  \r\n  If counsel had asked the questions before the jury, [3]  it is unlikely these responses \r\n  would have garnered respondent a verdict of not guilty.  While the responses \r\n  could have affected the credibility of the chemist in the eyes of the jury, \r\n  respondent has not met his burden of proving that he would have been granted \r\n  a new trial on appeal, but for trial counselâ€™s alleged deficient performance.\r\nAccordingly, we find the PCR court erred by granting \r\n  respondent relief on the ground counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve \r\n  for appeal the trial courtâ€™s limitations on cross-examining the chemist.\r\nISSUES \r\n  III and IV\r\n\r\nWhether the PCR court erred by finding counsel ineffective for failing to \r\n  properly preserve for appeal issues regarding an alleged Doyle \r\n  [4]  violation and a jurorâ€™s dismissal?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State argues the PCR court erred by finding \r\n  counsel ineffective for failing to properly preserve for appeal issues regarding \r\n  an alleged Doyle violation and a jurorâ€™s dismissal.  We agree.\r\nThese issues were previously addressed on the merits \r\n  in respondentâ€™s direct appeal.  State v. McLaughlin, supra.  We \r\n  affirmed respondentâ€™s convictions on the Doyle issue by citing Anderson \r\n  v. Charles, 447 U.S. 404, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980) (Doyle \r\n  does not apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent \r\n  statements of accused).  We affirmed his convictions \r\n  on the juror dismissal issue by citing State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, \r\n  388 S.E.2d 816 (1990) (juror competency is within discretion of trial judge); \r\n  State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 377 S.E.2d 298 (1989) (whether to grant \r\n  motion for mistrial is within trial courtâ€™s discretion); and State v. Prince, \r\n  279 S.C. 30, 301 S.E.2d 471 (1983) (mistrial should not be granted except in \r\n  cases of manifest necessity)).  Accordingly, the merits \r\n  of these issues have already been determined in respondentâ€™s direct appeal and \r\n  the PCR court erred by granting respondent relief on these grounds.  Cf. \r\n  Foye v. State, supra (issue raised on direct appeal but disposed \r\n  of on ground unpreserved may be raised in PCR proceeding).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the PCR court erred by granting respondent relief \r\n  and, as a result, the courtâ€™s decision is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]  The Departmentâ€™s records begin almost a week after respondentâ€™s \r\n    trial was completed.

Floyd, Circuit \r\n  Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25577\r\nSubmitted November 21, 2002 - Filed January \r\n  13, 2003\r\n\r\nVACATED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Tara S. Taggart, of Columbia, \r\n  for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, \r\n  Jr., and Attorney General William Bryan Dukes, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: \r\nWe granted a writ of certiorari \r\n  to review the denial of Petitionerâ€™s application for Post-Conviction Relief \r\n  (PCR).  We vacate the plea to possession of a firearm during commission of a \r\n  violent crime and remand the matter to family court.  \r\nFACTS\r\nAustin was charged with three counts of armed robbery, one count of assault \r\n  and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), and one count of possession of a firearm \r\n  during the commission of a violent crime.  The crimes occurred on June 24, June \r\n  27, [1]  and July \r\n  1, 1996, at a time when Austin was 15 years old (his date of birth is August \r\n  2, 1980).  Austin had no prior adjudications.  \r\nThe family court transferred jurisdiction of the offenses to general sessions \r\n  court pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-430(5)(1985). [2]   Austin pled guilty to one count \r\n  of armed robbery, ABIK and possession of a firearm during commission of a violent \r\n  crime.  He was sentenced to twenty years for armed robbery, twenty years for \r\n  ABIK, and five years, consecutive, for possession of a firearm.  His application \r\n  for PCR was denied; however, he was granted a belated review of his direct appeal \r\n  under White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).  We directed \r\n  the parties to brief the following issue:\r\nDid the Family Court have the power pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-430(5) \r\n  (1985) to transfer the charge of possession of a weapon during the commission \r\n  of a violent crime to circuit court?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAustin was fifteen years old when he committed the offenses to which he pled \r\n  guilty (the June 27, 1996 offenses).  At the time, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-430(5) \r\n  provided:\r\n\r\nIf a child fourteen or fifteen years of age is charged with an offense which, \r\n  if committed by an adult, would be a Class A, B, C, or D felony as defined \r\n  in Section 16-1-20 or a felony which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment \r\n  of fifteen years or more, the court, after full investigation and hearing, may \r\n  determine it contrary to the best interest of such child or of the public to \r\n  retain jurisdiction.  The court, acting as committing magistrate, may bind over \r\n  the child for proper criminal proceedings to a court which would have trial \r\n  jurisdiction of the offenses if committed by an adult.  (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nPossession \r\n  of a firearm during commission of a violent crime is not a Class A, B, C, or \r\n  D felony; rather it is a Class F felony pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-90(f), \r\n  which is not specifically enumerated in section 20-7-430(5).  We have specifically \r\n  held that only those offenses specifically enumerated in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-430(5) \r\n  may be waived up to the court of general sessions.  Johnson v. State, \r\n  312 S.C. 556, 437 S.E.2d 20 (1993).  The court of general sessions does not \r\n  have jurisdiction over charges which are not within the ambit of section 20-7-430(5).  \r\n  Id.  Because the offense of possession of a firearm during commission \r\n  of a violent crime may not be waived up for fourteen or fifteen year olds, the \r\n  circuit court was without jurisdiction over the charge.  Cf. Slocumb \r\n  v. State, 337 S.C. 46, 522 S.E.2d 809 (1999) (where petitioner was thirteen \r\n  at time he committed offense, general sessions court was without jurisdiction \r\n  to accept his plea to CSC charge).  Accordingly, Austinâ€™s plea and sentence \r\n  to possession of a firearm is vacated and the matter remanded to the family \r\n  court. [3] \r\n \r\n  VACATED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  MOORE, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    The \r\n    ABIK and possession of firearm occurred simultaneous with the June 27, 1996 \r\n    armed robbery.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]    Section 20-7-430 was repealed by 1996 Act No. 383, Â§ 2, \r\n    eff. July 1, 1996.  It was replaced by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605 (Supp. 2001).\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]    Austinâ€™s \r\n    remaining pleas and sentences are unaffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25578","title":"Moore v.

Todd, Jr., \r\n  and J. Derrick Jackson, both of Todd Holloway &amp; Ward, P.C., of Columbia, \r\n  for Petitioner.\r\nLeonard R. Jordan, Jr., \r\n  of Berry Quackenbush &amp; Stuart, P.A., of Columbia, for Respondent Louie E. \r\n  Moore.\r\nRobert E. Stepp, and \r\n  Laura W. Robinson, both of Sowell, Gray, Stepp &amp; Laffitte, L.L.C., of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent Community Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\nCURIAM:  This \r\n  case involves a dispute over the results of a mortgage foreclosure sale.  Fairfield \r\n  Real Estate Company, Inc. (Fairfield), of which respondent Louie E. Moore (Moore) \r\n  was the president and sole shareholder, executed and delivered several promissory \r\n  notes to plaintiff Jerry Branham and respondent Community Federal Savings and \r\n  Loan Association (Community), secured by mortgages on Fairfield=s \r\n  real estate.  Fairfield defaulted on these mortgages, and Branham brought the \r\n  underlying foreclose action.\r\nThe foreclosure action was \r\n  referred to a Special Referee who found that Communityâ€™s liens had first priority \r\n  and Branham had second priority.  The Special Referee ordered the property sold \r\n  at public auction and issued an order of foreclosure requiring the successful \r\n  bidder to post a deposit of five-percent of the successful bid.  \r\nAt the public auction, Moore \r\n  was the highest bidder, bidding $96,000 for the property.  However, Moore was \r\n  unable to immediately post the five-percent deposit, and the Special Referee \r\n  reopened the sale.  Petitioner was the highest bidder at the second sale, bidding \r\n  $84,100.  Petitioner was allowed fifteen minutes to post his deposit.  Petitioner \r\n  posted the bond, and the sale was concluded.  \r\nMoore filed an Objection \r\n  to the Confirmation of the Second Foreclosure Sale and a Motion to Confirm the \r\n  Initial Sale.  The Master-in-Equity denied the motions and found that the Special \r\n  Referee conducting the sale acted appropriately in requiring Moore to post a \r\n  deposit within minutes of the sale and that, upon Mooreâ€™s failure to do so, \r\n  conducting a second sale.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a purchaser at \r\n  a foreclosure sale has until 5:00 p.m. on the sale day to tender the deposit \r\n  unless the order of the court and the notice of the sale specifically provide \r\n  for a different payment time.  The Court of Appeals found that the \r\n  Special Referee impermissibly amended \r\n  the court order and notice of sale by requiring immediate payment of the deposit \r\n  and, therefore, the second sale to petitioner should be set aside.   \r\nEx parte Moore, 346 S.C. \r\n  274, 550 S.E.2d 877 (Ct. App. 2001).  \r\nWe granted certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion and \r\n  now reverse the Court of Appeals.\r\nThe terms and conditions of a judicial sale are controlled \r\n  by court order, Rule 71, SCRCP, and statute.  See S.C. Code Ann.15-39-660 \r\n  (1977) (requirements of the notice of sale); Rule 71(b), SCRCP (requirements \r\n  for the court order);  Ex parte Kellar, 185 S.C. 283, 194 S.E. 15 (1937) \r\n  (the court order sets the terms of the sale).  Further, although selling officers \r\n  may not alter the terms of the court order, they are given wide discretion in \r\n  the manner in which they conduct judicial sales.  Ex parte Kellar, supra.  \r\n  The Court of Appealsâ€™ bright-line 5:00 p.m. rule creates a condition not imposed \r\n  by statute and conflicts with established case law granting selling officers \r\n  broad discretion in conducting judicial sales.  Accordingly, we reverse the \r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nThe parties have notified the Court that they have reached a settlement agreement \r\n  under which petitioner will receive title to the land.  The parties ask the \r\n  Court to accept the agreement and vacate the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.\r\nIn light of our holding, we deny the request to vacate the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion.  However, we grant the remainder of the partiesâ€™ motion to approve \r\n  the settlement agreement without prejudice to the partiesâ€™ right to petition \r\n  the Court for rehearing in this matter.\r\nREVERSED.\r\n                   TOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25579","title":"German Evangelical v.

Koon, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam B. Regan, Carl W. Stent, and Frances I. Cantwell, \r\n  of Regan, Cantwell &amp; Stent, all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE \r\n  WALLER:  At issue in this case is whether four tax-exempt properties owned \r\n  by Appellant, [1]  German Evangelical Lutheran Church \r\n  of Charleston (a/k/a St. Matthewâ€™s Lutheran Church), located on King Street, \r\n  are subject to an assessment which was adopted by the Charleston City Council \r\n  pursuant to the Municipal Improvement Act of 1999, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-10 \r\n  et seq. (Supp. 2001).  The circuit court ruled the Church was properly subjected \r\n  to the assessment.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\nAugust 1999, Charleston \r\n  City Council adopted a resolution creating the King Street Streetscape Improvement \r\n  District (District), the purpose of which was to raise money by assessment to \r\n  property owners on King Street for improvements such as the undergrounding of \r\n  utilities, planting trees, new street lights, repaving King Street, installation \r\n  of granite curves with handicap accessibility and special bluestone sidewalks.  \r\n  Council adopted the resolution pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-40(B), which \r\n  allows council to adopt a resolution â€œupon written petition signed by a majority \r\n  . . . of the owners of real property within the district which is not exempt \r\n  from ad valorem taxation as provided by law.â€ [2]   The ordinance adopting the resolution \r\n  was ratified on Dec. 7, 1999.  \r\nThe Church, being a tax-exempt \r\n  property, did not participate in the petition method. [3]   It was, however, given notice \r\n  and appeared at two public hearings.  It also filed a written objection.  The \r\n  resolution was ultimately adopted by City Council, and the Church was assessed \r\n  a total of $5917.62 per year for a ten year period. [4]   It filed this complaint \r\n  challenging the assessment contending, inter alia, the Municipal Improvement \r\n  Act evidences a Legislative intent that tax-exempt properties not be subject \r\n  to assessments, and that it had been denied equal protection and due process \r\n  in not being allowed to participate in the petition process.  The circuit court \r\n  rejected Churchâ€™s claims, and upheld Cityâ€™s assessment. [5]    \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nMay the City of Charleston impose an assessment on Churchâ€™s tax-exempt \r\n  properties pursuant to the Municipal Improvement Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-10 \r\n  et seq.? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Municipal Improvement \r\n  Act of 1999 (Act) [6]  authorizes municipal governing bodies to establish \r\n  improvement districts and create an â€œimprovement planâ€ for purposes of preserving \r\n  property values, preventing deterioration of  urban areas, and preserving the \r\n  tax base of the municipality.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-20.   It is authorized \r\n  to finance such improvement plans by the imposition of assessments in accordance \r\n  with the Act, or by issuance of various sorts of bonds, or any combination thereof.  \r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 5-37-30.  Pursuant to section 5-37-40(A) &amp; (B) of the Act, a \r\n  municipality may create an improvement district, as follows:\r\n\r\n(A) If the governing body finds \r\n  that:\r\n  (1) improvements would be beneficial \r\n  within a designated improvement district;\r\n  (2) the improvements would preserve \r\n  or increase property values within the district;\r\n  (3) in the absence of the improvements, \r\n  property values within the area would be likely to depreciate, or that the proposed \r\n  improvements would be likely to encourage development in the improvement district;\r\n  (4) the general welfare and \r\n  tax base of the city would be maintained or likely improved by creation of an \r\n  improvement district in the city;  and\r\n  (5) it would be fair and equitable \r\n  to finance all or part of the cost of the improvements by an assessment upon \r\n  the real property within the district, the governing body may establish the \r\n  area as an improvement district and implement and finance, in whole or in part, \r\n  an improvement plan in the district in accordance with the provisions of this \r\n  chapter. However, owner-occupied residential property which is taxed under Section \r\n  12-43-220(c) must not be included within an improvement district unless the \r\n  owner gives the governing body written permission to include the property within \r\n  the improvement district.\r\n(B)  If an improvement district \r\n  is located in a redevelopment project area created under Title 31, Chapter 6, \r\n  the improvement district being created under the provisions of this chapter \r\n  must be considered to satisfy items (1) through (5) of subsection (A).   The \r\n  ordinance creating an improvement district may be adopted by a majority of council \r\n  after a public hearing at which the plan is presented, including the proposed \r\n  basis and amount of assessment, or upon written petition signed by a majority \r\n  in number of the owners of real property within the district which is not exempt \r\n  from ad valorem taxation as provided by law. However, owner-occupied residential \r\n  property which is taxed under Section 12-43-220(c) must not be included within \r\n  an improvement district unless the owner gives the governing body written permission \r\n  to include the property within the improvement district. [7]   (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, \r\n  City opted to use the emphasized method, i.e., a written petition by a majority \r\n  of the owners of real property within the district which is not exempt from \r\n  ad valorem taxation.\r\na.  Legislative \r\n  Intent\r\nThe Church asserts imposition \r\n  of an assessment against it is contrary to the legislative intent that tax-exempt \r\n  property owners not be subjected to charges, as evidenced by the fact that they \r\n  are not included in the petition process. [8]   \r\nInitially, we note that \r\n  municipalities do have the authority to impose assessments upon otherwise \r\n  tax-exempt churches for street improvements.  See City of Greenville \r\n  v. Query, 166 S.C. 281, 164 S.E. 244 (1931); Wesley M. E. Church v. Columbia, \r\n  105 S. C. 303, 89 S. E. 641 (1916)(churches and similar institutions, otherwise \r\n  exempted from taxation, have been denied by this court exemption from liability \r\n  for street improvement assessments).  See also Sutton v. Town of Fort \r\n  Mill, 171 S.C. 291, 172 S.E. 119 (1933)(recognizing distinction between \r\n  â€œtaxesâ€ and â€œassessmentsâ€ and holding that an assessment for street paving is \r\n  not a tax under the constitutional meaning).  The issue remains, however, whether \r\n  the Legislature intended to exempt tax-exempt properties from assessments under \r\n  the Municipal Improvement Act.\r\nEssentially, section \r\n  5-37-40(B) allows two methods to create an improvement district: it may be done \r\n  by a majority of council after a public hearing at which the plan is presented, \r\n  or it may be accomplished by written petition signed by a majority in \r\n  number of the owners of non-tax exempt real property within the district.  However, \r\n  even when a majority petitions, it is up to the governing body to create the \r\n  district by ordinance with such changes and/or modifications as it may determine.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-100.  It is also up to the governing body to adopt a resolution \r\n  describing the improvement district, and its purposes, and setting a public \r\n  hearing at which interested persons may be heard.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-50.  \r\n  Thereafter, the governing body may adopt an ordinance creating the district.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-100.  \r\nChurch argues the failure \r\n  of the Legislature to include it in the petition process under subsection 5-37-40(B) \r\n  indicates a legislative intent that it be exempted from assessments under the \r\n  Act.  We disagree.  The fact that the Legislature has seen fit to specifically \r\n  exempt some categories of properties from assessments under the Act, and has \r\n  failed to do so for tax-exempt properties, is dispositive.&nbsp; \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-20(3) \r\n  specifically exempts the State House grounds from inclusion in an improvement \r\n  district.  Further, section 5-37-40(B) exempts owner-occupied residential property \r\n  from inclusion within an improvement district unless the owner gives the governing \r\n  body written permission to include the property within such district.  1999 \r\n  Act No. 118, Â§ 2.  In Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000), \r\n  we recently recognized:\r\n\r\nThe canon of construction &quot;expressio \r\n  unius est exclusio alterius&quot; or &quot;inclusio unius est exclusio alterius&quot; \r\n  holds that &quot;to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of another, \r\n  or of the alternative.&quot;   Black's Law Dictionary 602 (7th ed. 1999). . \r\n  . . The enumeration of exclusions from the operation of a statute indicates \r\n  that the statute should apply to all cases not specifically excluded.  Exceptions \r\n  strengthen the force of the general law and enumeration weakens it as to things \r\n  not expressed.  Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction Â§ \r\n  47.23 at 227 (5th ed. 1992) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nHere, the General Assembly has \r\n  specifically exempted both owner-occupied residences and the State House grounds \r\n  from inclusion in improvement districts.  Under the doctrine of &quot;expressio \r\n  unius est exclusio alterius,&quot; its failure to exclude tax-exempt properties \r\n  is indicative of a legislative intent that such properties may be included in \r\n  an improvement district.  Accordingly, we find no clearly evinced legislative \r\n  intent expressed in section 5-37-40.  \r\nDue Process/Equal \r\n  Protection\r\nThe Church also asserts \r\n  that depriving it of the opportunity to participate in the petition process \r\n  violates due process and equal protection.  We disagree.  \r\nAs for its due process \r\n  contention, we find no violation.  Although Church did not have an opportunity \r\n  to petition to be in a majority of those supporting creation of an improvement \r\n  district, it was given notice of the resolution and ample opportunity to be \r\n  heard, along with the opportunity to file objections and appeal any assessment.  \r\n  Moreover, as the circuit found, the petition process is merely the first step \r\n  in the process of adopting an ordinance to create an improvement district.  \r\n  It does not result in creation of the district; the actual creation of the district \r\n  still depends upon a favorable majority vote of City Council. [9]   In fact, the ordinance here was \r\n  not adopted until there had been two public hearings, at which objections were \r\n  heard, and a favorable second reading of the resolution at council.  We find \r\n  Church was sufficiently afforded due process.  Accord Stono River \r\n  Envâ€™t Prot. Assâ€™n v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envâ€™tl Control, \r\n  305 S.C. 90, 406 S.E.2d 340 (1991); Ogburn-Matthews v. Loblolly Partners, \r\n  332 S.C. 551, 505 S.E.2d 598 (Ct.App.1998) (requirements of due process include \r\n  notice, an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way, and judicial review).\r\nChurch also asserts \r\n  it is being denied equal protection as it is being treated differently from \r\n  others who are similarly situated, i.e., it is being assessed along with all \r\n  other property owners, but it is not allowed to initiate creation of a district \r\n  via the petition process.  We disagree.\r\nTo satisfy the Equal \r\n  Protection Clause, a classification must (1) bear a reasonable relation to the \r\n  legislative purpose sought to be achieved, (2) members of the class must be \r\n  treated alike under similar circumstances, and (3) the classification must rest \r\n  on some rational basis.  D.W. Flowe &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Christopher Constr. \r\n  Co., 326 S.C. 17, 23, 482 S.E.2d 558, 562 (1997).  A legislative enactment \r\n  will be sustained against constitutional attack if there is &quot;any reasonable \r\n  hypothesis&quot; to support it.  Id. \r\nContrary to Churchâ€™s \r\n  contention, it is not similarly situated to other property owners; it is tax-exempt.  \r\n  We find the Legislature could reasonably have determined that those property \r\n  owners who currently pay taxes on their property should be afforded a greater \r\n  voice in determining whether an improvement district is to be created.  Given \r\n  that the non-exempt property owners already bear a greater financial burden \r\n  with respect to payment of taxes, we find it completely logical that they should \r\n  likewise be the ones to petition for creation of a district.  Indeed, it would \r\n  seem anomalous to allow those tax-exempt property owners, who currently share \r\n  none of the financial burdens, to petition for creation of a district resulting \r\n  in an even greater financial responsibility on those who do currently pay ad \r\n  valorem taxes. [10]     \r\n  Accordingly, we find no equal protection violation.  \r\nFurther, under section \r\n  5-37-40, the municipality is not required to obtain a majority of any property \r\n  owners and can adopt an ordinance by a majority of county council, and is not \r\n  in any way bound by a majority petition.  We fail to see in what manner exclusion \r\n  of the Church from the petition process denies it of equal protection or due \r\n  process.\r\nWe find the failure \r\n  to include tax-exempt properties from the petition process of section 5-37-40 \r\n  (B) does not indicate a Legislative intent to exempt such properties from an \r\n  assessment under the Municipal Improvement Act.  Further, we find a lack of \r\n  participation in the petition process does not deprive Church of either equal \r\n  protection or due process.  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s ruling upholding \r\n  the assessment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  I respectfully dissent.  In my opinion, \r\n  the General Assembly intended to exclude owners of property exempt from ad valorem \r\n  taxation from assessment under the Municipal Improvement Act.  Accordingly, \r\n  I would reverse the trial judgeâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of \r\n  the City.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the Court ascertain and \r\n  effectuate the actual intent of the legislature.  Burns v. State Farm Mut. \r\n  Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 520, 377 S.E.2d 569 (1989).  A statute as a whole \r\n  must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with \r\n  the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.  Browning v. Hartvigsen, \r\n  307 S.C. 122, 414 S.E.2d 115 (1992).  \r\nAs originally enacted, the predecessor to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§5-37-40(B) \r\n  (Supp. 2001) provided:  \r\n\r\n. . . If the governing body shall find . . \r\n  . and (v) that it would be fair and equitable to finance all or part of the \r\n  cost of such improvements by an assessment upon the real property located within \r\n  such district, the governing body may establish such area as an improvement \r\n  district and implement and finance, in whole or in part, an improvement plan \r\n  therein in accordance with the provisions of this act; provided, \r\n  that the governing body shall, prior to the enactment of the ordinance creating \r\n  the improvement district, obtain written consent for the creation of such improvement \r\n  district from a majority in number of the owners of real property within the \r\n  district and having an aggregate assessed value in excess of sixty-six percent \r\n  of the assessed value of all real property within such improvement district. \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. 1207, Â§ 4, 1974 Acts 2813(italic in original) (underline added).  \r\nThereafter, the General Assembly amended the Municipal \r\n  Improvement Act as follows:   \r\n\r\nIf the governing body finds that: . . . (v) it would be fair and equitable \r\n  to finance all or part of the cost of the improvements by an assessment upon \r\n  the real property within the district, the governing body may establish the \r\n  area as an improvement district and implement and finance, in whole or part, \r\n  an improvement plan in the district in accordance with the provisions of this \r\n  chapter.  However, the governing body, prior to the enactment of the ordinance \r\n  creating the improvement district, shall obtain written consent for the creation \r\n  of the improvement district from a majority in number of the owners of real \r\n  property within the district that is not exempt from taxation under the Internal \r\n  Revenue Code and having an aggregate assessed value in excess of sixty-six percent \r\n  of the assessed value of all real property within the improvement district that \r\n  is not exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code.  \r\n\r\nAct No. 160, Â§ 1, 1987 S.C. Acts 1081 (underline added).  \r\nThe following year, the legislature again amended the \r\n  Municipal Improvement Act to permit, in relevant part, adoption of an improvement \r\n  district through initiative.  In part, the statute provided:\r\n\r\n. . . The ordinance creating an improvement \r\n  district may be adopted by a majority of council after a public hearing at which \r\n  the plan is presented, including the proposed basis of the assessment, or \r\n  upon written petition signed by a majority in number of the owners of real property \r\n  within the district which is not exempt from ad valorem taxation as provided \r\n  by law. \r\n\r\nAct No. 505, Â§ 2, 1988 S.C. Acts 4550.  \r\nIn 1999, this section was again amended.  It appears \r\n  today as follows:\r\n\r\n. . . The ordinance creating an improvement district may be adopted by a majority \r\n  of counsel after a public hearing at which the plan is presented, including \r\n  the proposed basis and amount of assessment, or upon written petition signed \r\n  by a majority in number of the owners of real property within the district which \r\n  is not exempt from ad valorem taxation as provided by law.  However, owner-occupied \r\n  residential property which is taxed under Section 12-43-220(c) must not be included \r\n  within an improvement district unless the owner gives the governing body written \r\n  permission to include the property within the improvement district.  \r\n\r\nAct No. 118, 1999 S.C. Acts 1238 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-37-40 (Supp. \r\n  2001).  \r\nThe legislative history of the Municipal Improvement \r\n  Act indicates the General Assemblyâ€™s clear intent to allow a municipality to \r\n  assess the improvement fee only upon those property owners who have property \r\n  which is subject to ad valorem taxation.  See Wade v. Berkeley County, \r\n  348 S.C. 224, 559 S.E.2d 586 (2002) (in interpreting a statute, the Court will \r\n  not ignore its clear legislative history).  Until 1988, the Municipal Improvement \r\n  Act required a municipality to obtain the consent of a majority of owners who \r\n  had taxable real property with an assessed value in excess of sixty-six percent \r\n  before establishing an improvement district.  In 1988, the General Assembly \r\n  deleted the majority consent requirement, but added a petition method which \r\n  permitted a majority of tax-paying property owners to petition the municipality \r\n  for creation of an improvement district.  In 1999, the legislature added the \r\n  provision which required owners of owner-occupied residential property to consent \r\n  to inclusion of their property in the improvement district.   \r\nAs I read the history of the Municipal Improvement Act, \r\n  the General Assembly intended only those property owners who are subject to \r\n  ad valorem taxation to pay the assessments for the improvement district.  To \r\n  hold otherwise and require churches and other charitable institutions who receive \r\n  no economic benefit from the improvement district would be absurd.  \r\nContrary to the majorityâ€™s analysis, the owner-occupied \r\n  provision does not evince the legislatureâ€™s intent to exclude only owner-occupied \r\n  residencies from the assessment.  Instead, the provision indicates the General \r\n  Assemblyâ€™s intent to exclude only one type of property subject to ad valorem \r\n  taxation - - owner-occupied residences -- from the improvement district assessment.  \r\n  All other owners of property subject to ad valorem taxation are subject to the \r\n  assessment.  Since Church is not subject to ad valorem taxation, [11]  City may not assess Church for the improvement \r\n  district.   \r\nFinally, Section 5-37-20(3) \r\n  which precludes the State House grounds from inclusion in any special improvement \r\n  district does not evince the General Assemblyâ€™s intent as to which property \r\n  owners must pay the assessments for improvement districts.  \r\nIn my opinion, the trial judge erred in granting summary \r\n  judgment in Cityâ€™s favor.  I would reverse.  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]    The properties include the church \r\n    and Sunday school building, a community outreach center, a parking lot for \r\n    employees, and a building the Church hopes to turn into a parking facility.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]   Alternatively, a majority of council \r\n    may implement an improvement district without the consent of a majority of \r\n    property owners.  Section 5-37-40(B).  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [3]    There is some testimony in the \r\n    record that even tax-exempt properties were sent copies of the petitions.  \r\n    However, counsel for the Church denied having received a copy of the petition.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [4]    The assessment is based upon a \r\n    formula: 50% based on the assessed value of the properties, and 50% based \r\n    on linear footage.  Since Church properties have no assessment value for tax \r\n    purposes, the Churchâ€™s assessment is generally less than that of non-tax exempt \r\n    properties.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [5]    The circuit court also ruled City \r\n    had the authority to impose an assessment pursuant to its Home Rule powers.  \r\n    In light of our holding, we need not address this contention.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [6]    The Act was originally enacted \r\n    in 1973 and has been amended several times, most recently by 1999 Act No. \r\n    118, Â§ 2, eff. June 30, 1999.  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [7]   The owner occupied exemption was \r\n    added in the 1999 amendments.  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [8]    Church does not argue the assessment \r\n    is in fact a â€œtaxâ€ and has not appealed the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that the \r\n    assessment is a fee rather than a tax.   See Brown v. County of Horry, \r\n    308 S.C. 180, 417 S.E.2d 565 (1992) (generally, a tax is an enforced contribution \r\n    to provide for the support of government, whereas a fee is a charge for a \r\n    particular benefit to the payer).  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [9]   \r\n  See also S.C. Code Â§Â§ 5-37-50, \r\n    5-37-60, 5-37-100, 5-37-100, 5-37-110, 5-37-120, and 5-37-120 (setting forth \r\n    procedures municipality must follow to enact ordinance and make assessments).\r\n\r\n \r\n    [10]    It is undisputed that of the \r\n    309 properties in the improvement district, only 14 were tax-exempt.  The \r\n    Cityâ€™s director of economic development testified that even if all 14 of the \r\n    tax-exempt organizations been against the district, it would not have altered \r\n    the majority petition in favor of the district.  However, if all tax-exempt \r\n    properties owners were allowed to petition, it could have an impact on the \r\n    required 51% majority needed under section 5-27-40(B).\r\n\r\n \r\n  11 S.C.

Richardson, Jr., and Susan M. Johnston, both of Columbia, \r\n  for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nStephen M. Pstrak, of Lexington, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In \r\n  this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to \r\n  Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct \r\n  and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand or a definite suspension \r\n  not to exceed eight months.  We accept the agreement and find an eight month \r\n  suspension from the practice of law is the appropriate sanction.  The facts, \r\n  as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nIn or around July 2000, respondent represented \r\n  a client who had been charged with speeding.  Respondent sent a letter to the \r\n  Clerk of Court for the Spartanburg Central Court setting forth the following \r\n  as a possible disposition of his client's charge:\r\n\r\n1.       Noll Pross, treating the matter as a warning to be more responsible \r\n  in the future, seeking restitution rather than retribution, as a professional \r\n  courtesy.  You are prosecuting this matter in the County of Spartanburg.  I \r\n  am representing and advising my client and am the town prosecutor for the Town \r\n  of Gilbert in Lexington County, South Carolina.  Gilbert, as the county seat \r\n  of Spartanburg, is a member of the Municipal Association of South Carolina.  \r\n  Spartanburg's Attorney, H. Spencer King and I are members of South Carolina \r\n  Municipal Attorney's Association.  I plan to vacation with Mayor Talley at the \r\n  Municipal Association annual meeting in July.  Please allow every possible \r\n  consideration for treating this matter as a warning.\r\n\r\nRespondent acknowledged that he is not, nor has he ever been, the town &quot;prosecutor&quot; \r\n  for Gilbert, South Carolina.  Respondent is the appointed attorney for the Town \r\n  of Gilbert.  He represents the Town of Gilbert in instituting and defending \r\n  all actions at law and appears on behalf of the town, and any of its officers, \r\n  in legal proceedings in which the town or its officers may be a party or have \r\n  an interest.  Respondent does not prosecute criminal cases for the town.\r\nRespondent also acknowledged that he does not personally know H. Spencer King \r\n  or Mayor Talley and that he never &quot;vacationed&quot; with Mayor Talley.  \r\n  Accordingly, respondent's representations concerning Mr. King and Mayor Talley \r\n  were misleading.  Respondent sought, through these misrepresentations, to improperly \r\n  influence the court, the clerk of court and/or the state trooper to base the \r\n  disposition of his client's speeding ticket on respondent's acquaintances rather \r\n  than make such decisions according to law.\r\nIn representing another client charged with speeding, respondent sent a letter \r\n  to the Richland County Central Traffic Court, to the attention of &quot;Clerk \r\n  of Court, Presiding Judge, Officer Bryant [and] Officer Gentry,&quot; asking \r\n  that his client's charge be nolle prossed as a professional courtesy and advising \r\n  that he was &quot;the city prosecutor for a city in Lexington County . . . .&quot;    \r\n  In this same letter, respondent stated, &quot;I am the Director of the South \r\n  Carolina Trooper's Coalition.  [My client] has made a very large donation in \r\n  the past and is willing to do so again now if he is able to continue driving \r\n  and flying . . . in the Air National Guard.&quot;  In a subsequent letter to \r\n  City Attorney Dana Thye, respondent stated, &quot;If treating the matter as \r\n  a warning is not agreeable, [my client] is willing to cheerfully make \r\n  a contribution to the City Police Department Benevolent Society \\ charity ball \r\n  or similar concern as a good-faith gesture of his regret for this pending matter.&quot;\r\nFinally, in representing a third client charged with speeding, respondent \r\n  wrote the Clerk of Court for the Town of Wagener and the arresting officer and \r\n  again advised that he was the town prosecutor for Gilbert, South Carolina. \r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 7.1(a)(a lawyer \r\n  shall not make a material misrepresentation of fact about the lawyer); Rule \r\n  8.4(e)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); and Rule 8.4(f)(a lawyer shall not state or imply an ability to influence \r\n  improperly a government agency or official).\r\nConclusion\r\nIn our opinion, respondent's misconduct warrants \r\n  an eight month suspension from the practice of law.  As a condition of reinstatement, \r\n  respondent shall submit the name of a lawyer who, upon approval by this Court, \r\n  will serve as a mentor for respondent for one year following reinstatement.  \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25581","title":"Furtick v.

Knox, Tommy Evans, Jr., \r\n  and J. Benjamin Aplin, of South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and \r\n  Pardon Services, all of Columbia, for appellant\r\nJames\r\nFurtick, of Bennettsville, \r\n  pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: The South Carolina Department of Probation, \r\n  Parole, and Pardon Services (â€œDPPPSâ€) argues that the circuit court erred in \r\n  holding that the Administrative Law Judge Division (â€œALJDâ€) has jurisdiction \r\n  to review the final decision of the DPPPS in this case.\r\nFactual / Procedural \r\n  Background\r\nRespondent, James Furtick, \r\n  was indicted for burglary in the second degree and grand larceny on June 30, \r\n  1994 for crimes committed in September 1992.  Respondent was convicted as charged \r\n  and sentenced to fifteen years for burglary in the second degree and three years \r\n  for grand larceny, to run consecutively.  The Court of Appeals affirmed Respondentâ€™s \r\n  conviction and sentence.  State v. Furtick, 95-UP-338 (Ct. App. filed \r\n  December 28, 1995).\r\nInitially, the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Corrections (â€œSCDCâ€) projected that Respondent would be eligible \r\n  for parole.  Based on this projection, the DPPPS notified Respondent that a \r\n  parole hearing had been scheduled.  Before the scheduled hearing, however, the \r\n  DPPPS notified Respondent that he was not eligible for parole on his burglary \r\n  conviction because he was classified as a subsequent violent offender under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. 1992).  Section 24-21-640 provides, in relevant \r\n  part, \r\n\r\nThe board must not grant parole . . . to any prisoner serving \r\n  a sentence for a second or subsequent conviction, following a separate sentencing \r\n  for a prior conviction, for violent crimes as defined in Section 16-1-60.\r\n\r\nSection 24-21-640 was in effect both in 1992, when \r\n  Respondent committed the crimes, and in 1994, when Respondent was tried and \r\n  convicted.  Section 16-1-60 was enacted under the 1986 Omnibus Criminal Justice \r\n  Improvements Act, [1]  and defines burglary in the second degree as a \r\n  violent crime. [2]   \r\n\r\nThe DPPPS classified Respondent \r\n  as a violent offender based on a prior conviction for voluntary manslaughter. \r\n  [3]            Respondent objected to the DPPPSâ€™s classification \r\n  of him as a â€œviolent offender,â€ and ultimately appealed from the DPPPSâ€™s decision \r\n  to the ALJD.  The ALJD dismissed Respondentâ€™s appeal on grounds that the ALJD \r\n  lacked jurisdiction to review an appeal from a final decision of the DPPPS.  \r\n  Respondent appealed, and the circuit court reversed and remanded, finding that \r\n  the ALJD does have jurisdiction to review the final decision of the DPPPS in \r\n  this case.  \r\nDPPPS raises the following \r\n  issue on appeal:\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in finding that the ALJD \r\n  has jurisdiction to review the DPPPSâ€™s final decision that Respondent is not \r\n  eligible for parole by operation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640?\r\n\r\n &nbsp;Law /Analysis\r\nRespondent argues that \r\n  the ALJD has jurisdiction to hear his appeal from the decision made by the DPPPS \r\n  that he is not parole eligible by operation of section 24-21-640.  We agree.\r\nEssentially, Respondent \r\n  argues that section 16-1-60 operates as an ex post facto law in conjunction \r\n  with section 24-21-640 because it enhances his sentence, making him ineligible \r\n  for parole.  This Court has defined ex post facto claims as non-collateral \r\n  matters.  Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 531 S.E.2d 507 (2000).  In \r\n  Al-Shabazz v. State, this Court held, \r\n\r\n[a]n inmate may . . . seek \r\n  review of [the SCDCâ€™s] final decision in an administrative manner under the \r\n  [Administrative Procedures Act (â€œAPAâ€)].  Placing review of these cases within \r\n  the ambit of the APA will ensure that an inmate receives due process, which \r\n  consists of notice, a hearing, and judicial review.  \r\n\r\n338 S.C. 354, 369, 527 \r\n  S.E.2d 742, 750 (1999).  This Court recognized that not all of the SCDCâ€™s decisions \r\n  were subject to review by the ALJD, and specifically declined to apply certain \r\n  provisions of the APA to decisions made as part of the SCDCâ€™s internal disciplinary \r\n  process.  Id.  The Court distinguished internal disciplinary decisions \r\n  from the denial of sentence-related credits at issue in Al-Shabazz, however, \r\n  on grounds that denial of good time credits affected a constitutionally protected \r\n  liberty interest.  Id. at 369-70, 527 S.E.2d at 750 (citing Wolff \r\n  v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d. 935 (1974)).  \r\nIn Wolff v. McDonnell, \r\n  the United States Supreme Court found that Nebraska had created a statutory \r\n  right to good time credits, which provided that good time credits were to be \r\n  forfeited only for serious misbehavior.  418 U.S. at 557, 94 S.Ct. at 2975, \r\n  41 L.Ed.2d at 951 (citing Neb. Rev. Stat. Â§ 83-1 (Supp. 1972)).  Based on Nebraskaâ€™s \r\n  statute, the United States Supreme Court found,\r\n\r\nthe prisonerâ€™s interest \r\n  [in good time credits] has real substance and is sufficiently embraced within \r\n  the Fourteenth Amendment â€œlibertyâ€ to entitle him to those minimum procedures \r\n  appropriate under the circumstances and required by the Due Process clause to \r\n  ensure that the state-created right is not arbitrarily abrogated.   \r\n\r\n418 U.S. at 557, 94 S.Ct. \r\n  at 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d at 951.\r\nLike the inmate in Wolff, \r\n  the inmate in Al-Shabazz protested the SCDCâ€™s reduction of good time \r\n  credits he had accrued as a method of punishment.  In Al-Shabazz, this \r\n  Court found the inmate had a â€œprotected liberty interest due to the potential \r\n  loss of sentence-related creditsâ€ and, therefore, that he was entitled to review \r\n  by the ALJD, and in turn, to review by the judicial branch.  338 S.C. at 382, \r\n  527 S.E.2d at 757.\r\nIn Al-Shabazz, the \r\n  Court recognized that â€œ[t]hese administrative matters typically arise in two \r\n  ways:  (1) when an inmate is disciplined and punishment is imposed and (2) when \r\n  an inmate believes prison officials have erroneously calculated his sentence, \r\n  sentence-related credits, or custody status.â€  338 S.C. at 369, 527 S.E.2d at \r\n  750.  Respondentâ€™s case arises in the latter manner.  He alleges that the DPPPS \r\n  erroneously determined that he is not eligible for parole.\r\nUnder Wolff, to \r\n  determine whether Respondent is entitled to review of the DPPPSâ€™s decision, \r\n  the Court must decide whether Respondent has a liberty interest in gaining access \r\n  to the parole board.  In our opinion, the permanent denial of parole \r\n  eligibility implicates a liberty interest sufficient to require at least \r\n  minimal due process.   Section 24-21-620 provides for review by the Board, â€œregardless \r\n  of whether or not any application has been made therefore, for the purposes \r\n  of determining whether or not such prisoner is entitled to any of the benefits \r\n  provided for in this chapter.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-620 (Supp. 1992). \r\n  [4]   \r\nFollowing DPPPSâ€™s determination \r\n  that Respondent was ineligible for parole as a violent offender under section \r\n  24-21-640, Respondent then had the same right to review as the inmate in Al-Shabazz.  \r\n  In Al-Shabazz, the Court outlined the nature of the review available \r\n  to inmates raising non-collateral issues that implicate liberty interests; those \r\n  procedures apply equally to inmates affected by final decisions of the DPPPS \r\n  that affect liberty interests, such as the decision in this case.\r\nAlthough we believe Respondent \r\n  was entitled to review of his claim by the ALJD, we will address the merits \r\n  of his claim now for the sake of judicial economy.  The issue Respondent raises \r\n  is well-settled on the merits.  As discussed, Respondent argues that he has \r\n  been subjected to an ex post facto law because retroactively designating \r\n  his 1968 manslaughter conviction a violent crime has enhanced his punishment \r\n  for that crime.  We disagree.\r\nIn Phillips v. State, \r\n  under very similar factual circumstances, this Court held â€œ[i]t is not a violation \r\n  of the ex post facto clause for the legislature to enhance punishment \r\n  for a later offense based on a prior conviction, even though the enhancement \r\n  provision was not in effect at the time of the prior offense.â€  331 S.C. 482, \r\n  484, 504 S.E.2d 111, 112 (1998) (citing State v. Dabney, 301 S.C. 271, \r\n  391 S.E.2d 563 (1990)).  In Phillips, the inmateâ€™s 1982 armed robbery \r\n  conviction was used to deny him parole eligibility on his sentence for a 1987 \r\n  burglary conviction even though armed robbery was not a violent crime until \r\n  section 16-1-60 was enacted in 1986. \r\n  [5]   \r\nSimilarly, the DPPPS claims \r\n  Respondentâ€™s 1968 voluntary manslaughter conviction can be used to deny him \r\n  parole eligibility on the sentence he is currently serving for burglary in the \r\n  second degree, as both were violent crimes under section 16-1-60 when Respondent \r\n  committed the burglary in 1992.  This Court has determined that the time that \r\n  the crime was committed is the relevant time for purposes of characterizing \r\n  the crime as violent or non-violent, not the time that the inmate was convicted.  \r\n  See Sullivan v. State, 331 S.C. 479, 504 S.E.2d 110 (1998); Phillips, \r\n  331 S.C. at 484, 504 S.E.2d at 112, footnote 2 (noting that section 16-1-60 \r\n  was amended between 1993 and 1995 to provide prospective effect only, but declining \r\n  to express an opinion on the impact of this language on persons committing \r\n  offenses during that period).  \r\nAccordingly, Respondent \r\n  is not eligible for parole under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. 1992).\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the \r\n  order of the circuit court holding that the ALJD does have jurisdiction over \r\n  non-collateral challenges to final decisions of the DPPPS under the procedure \r\n  outlined in Al-Shabazz.  On the merits, we find that Respondent as a \r\n  violent offender is not eligible for parole.\r\n         \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  1986 Act No. 462 Â§ 33.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]   In addition to burglary in the second degree, section 16-1-60 \r\n    defines the following offenses as violent crimes:  murder, criminal sexual \r\n    conduct in the first and second degree, assault and battery with intent to \r\n    kill, kidnapping, voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, drug trafficking, \r\n    arson in the first degree, and burglary in the first degree.  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 16-1-60 (Supp. 1991) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   Respondent pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter in \r\n    1968, and was sentenced to 30 years.  Respondent escaped from prison in 1971, \r\n    was captured, and sentenced to 2 additional years for escape.  In addition, \r\n    Respondent was charged with housebreaking and grand larceny (committed before \r\n    he was recaptured), and was sentenced to 15 additional years.  In 1978, Respondent \r\n    was released on parole for the remainder of the 47 years of his sentence.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]   Although this provision creates a liberty interest in parole \r\n    eligibility, it does not create a liberty interest in parole.  Section 24-21-620 \r\n    also provides the procedure to follow when the Board determines not to grant \r\n    parole for a potentially eligible inmate:  â€œ[u]pon a negative \r\n    determination, the prisonerâ€™s case shall be reviewed every twelve months thereafter \r\n    for the purpose of such determination.â€  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]   In Phillips, the inmate raised his ex post facto \r\n    challenge by bringing an action for post-conviction relief (â€œPCRâ€).  After \r\n    Al-Shabazz, this avenue is no longer available.  The Court held that \r\n    PCR â€œis a proper avenue for relief only when the applicant mounts a collateral \r\n    attack challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence as authorized \r\n    by section 17-27-20(a).â€  Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 367, 527 S.E.2d at \r\n    749.  For this reason, it is especially important that Respondent receive \r\n    some form of administrative review of the DPPPSâ€™s permanent denial \r\n    of parole eligibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25582","title":"Burnett v.

Allen Bullard, Jr., \r\n  and Assistant Attorney General Douglas E. Leadbitter, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen \r\n  P. Clare, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Respondent, \r\n  Robert Lee Burnett (â€œBurnettâ€), filed an application for post-conviction relief \r\n  (â€œPCRâ€).  The PCR court granted relief, and the State filed a petition for writ \r\n  of certiorari. \r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nBurnett pled guilty \r\n  to malicious injury to personal property, assault and battery of a high and \r\n  aggravated nature (â€œABHANâ€), and three counts of pointing a firearm.  He was \r\n  sentenced to thirty days on the property charge, and ten years consecutive on \r\n  the ABHAN charge (suspended on service of five years in prison and five years \r\n  of probation).  In addition, he was sentenced to three years on the first firearm \r\n  charge, four years on the second firearm charge, and five years on the third \r\n  firearm charge, all to be served concurrently.  Burnettâ€™s aggregate sentence \r\n  was ten years imprisonment, and five years of probation. \r\n  [1]   \r\nBurnett did not file \r\n  a direct appeal.  He filed an application for PCR, alleging that his guilty \r\n  plea was involuntary.  The PCR judge granted relief and this Court granted certiorari \r\n  to review the following issue:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err in granting \r\n  PCR on grounds that Burnettâ€™s guilty plea was involuntary?\r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nThe State argues that the \r\n  PCR court erred in finding that Burnettâ€™s counsel was ineffective and that his \r\n  guilty plea was involuntary.  We agree.\r\nEntering a guilty plea results in a waiver of several \r\n  constitutional rights, therefore the Due Process Clause requires that defendants \r\n  enter into guilty pleas voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.  Boykin \r\n  v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969).  This \r\n  Court has held that, â€œin addition to the requirements of Boykin, a defendant \r\n  entering a guilty plea must be aware of the nature and crucial elements of the \r\n  offense, the maximum and any mandatory minimum penalty, and the nature of the \r\n  constitutional rights being waived.â€  Pittman v. State, 337 S.C. 597, \r\n  599, 524 S.E.2d 623, 624 (1999) (citing Dover v. State, 304 S.C. 433, \r\n  405 S.E.2d 391 (1991); State v. Hazel, 275 S.C. 392, 271 S.E.2d 602 (1980)).  \r\n  A plea made in ignorance of its direct consequences is entered in ignorance \r\n  and is invalid.  Hazel, 275 S.C. 392, 271 S.E.2d 602.     \r\nA defendant who pleads guilty on the advice of \r\n  counsel may collaterally attack the voluntariness of his plea only by showing \r\n  that (1) counsel was ineffective and that (2) there is a reasonable probability \r\n  that but for counselâ€™s errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty.  Wolfe \r\n  v. State, 326 S.C. 158, 485 S.E.2d 367 (1997).  When considering an allegation \r\n  on PCR that a guilty plea was based on inaccurate advice of counsel, the transcript \r\n  of the guilty plea hearing will be considered to determine whether information \r\n  conveyed by the plea judge cured any possible error made by counsel.  Moorehead \r\n  v. State, 329 S.C. 329, 496 S.E.2d 415 (1998).  The Court will uphold the \r\n  PCR courtâ€™s findings if there is any evidence of probative value to support \r\n  them.  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).\r\nIn Moorehead, the \r\n  defendant pled guilty to criminal sexual conduct (â€œCSCâ€) in the third degree, \r\n  and was sentenced to ten years, suspended after service of seven years, and \r\n  five years probation.  329 S.C. 329, 496 S.E.2d 415.  At the PCR hearing, the \r\n  defendant testified that he pled guilty to the CSC charge based on counselâ€™s \r\n  advice that he would receive only probation.  Id.  At the plea hearing, \r\n  however, the judge asked the defendant if he understood that the possible sentence \r\n  for CSC was ten years, and summarized the plea agreement on the record.  Id.  \r\n  The defendant said he understood the possible sentence and the plea agreement \r\n  as a whole.  Id.  Based on the colloquy between the defendant and the \r\n  plea judge, this Court reversed the PCR courtâ€™s grant of relief, holding that \r\n  â€œ[e]ven if trial counsel erroneously informed [defendant] that his sentence \r\n  would be probationary, any misconception was cured at the plea hearing.â€  Id. \r\n  at 333, 496 S.E.2d at 416-17.\r\nIn the case before the \r\n  Court now, the colloquy between the plea judge and defendant was even more comprehensive \r\n  than the one in Moorehead.  In this case, the plea judge informed Burnett \r\n  of the maximum penalties for each of his crimes (25 years if sentenced consecutively), \r\n  and informed Burnett that he had not agreed to give him a particular sentence.  \r\n  The judge told Burnett, â€œthereâ€™s been no promise by this Court as to what the \r\n  sentence would be.  You [could] get one after the other after the other.  They \r\n  could be concurrent, consecutive, jail time, combination.  I just donâ€™t know.â€  \r\n  After asking if Burnett understood that he had not agreed to give him any particular \r\n  sentence, the judge asked Burnett if anyone else had promised him anything about \r\n  his sentence.  Burnett indicated he understood the possible sentences, and answered \r\n  that no one had made promises to him about his sentence.  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, Burnettâ€™s \r\n  trial counsel testified, \r\n\r\nIâ€™m sure I didnâ€™t tell him that he was going to get three \r\n  years because I didnâ€™t have a clue what he was going to get.  Iâ€™m sure I told \r\n  him he could get up to 25 as did the judge he had to plea in front of.  Itâ€™s \r\n  possible that I told him you might get three years, but I meant that loosely \r\n  and I hope by my saying you might get three years didnâ€™t mean that I thought \r\n  that he was necessarily, but that was certainly within the range of possible \r\n  sentences. \r\n\r\nTrial counsel testified further, â€œI donâ€™t tell them \r\n  what a judge is going to do.  I tell them what the sentence range could be, \r\n  thatâ€™s my practice.â€  Trial counsel admitted that he knew three years was what \r\n  Burnett wanted, and that it was possible Burnett could have thought he \r\n  was going to get three years, but reiterated that anything he might have said \r\n  regarding three years would have been qualified by a statement that he didnâ€™t \r\n  know what Burnett would get.\r\nThe plea judge accepted Burnettâ€™s \r\n  guilty pleas only after a very thorough questioning of Burnettâ€™s understanding \r\n  of what rights he was waiving by pleading guilty, what his possible sentences \r\n  were, and that the judge had not agreed to give him any particular sentence.   \r\n\r\nIn our opinion, the record in this case does not \r\n  indicate that trial counsel promised Burnett a three-year sentence.  Regardless, \r\n  any possible misconceptions on Burnettâ€™s part were cured by the colloquy during \r\n  the actual plea hearing.  See Moorehead; Wolfe.  For this reason, we \r\n  find there is no probative evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that \r\n  Burnett received ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  we REVERSE the PCR courtâ€™s grant of relief.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]\r\n   The charges against Burnett arose out \r\n    of a single incident.  Apparently, Burnett got angry with a driver in front \r\n    of him on the highway and bumped his car from behind.  The other driver pulled \r\n    into a gas station to get help, and Burnett followed him.  Burnett got out \r\n    of his car and began beating the driver of the other vehicle.  At some point, \r\n    Burnett produced a gun, and pointed it at the driver and at two bystanders \r\n    in the parking lot.  He fired one shot into the driverâ€™s vehicle without injuring \r\n    anyone, and then drove away. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of James Graham Bennett, Respondent","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-01-09-01","description":"Respondent reinstated to the practice of law.","date":"2003-01-13","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn \r\nthe Matter of James Graham Bennett, Respondent\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 2002, Respondent was suspended from the practice of law for \r\n  a period of eight months, retroactive to October 17, 2000.&nbsp; He has now filed \r\n  an affidavit requesting reinstatement pursuant to Rule 32, of the Rules for \r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement contained in Rule 413, SCACR.  \r\nThe request is granted and he is hereby reinstated to the practice of law in \r\n  this state.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     JEAN H.

Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-50(B)(6) \r\n  (Supp. 2001), originally enacted as part of the Charter Schools Act of 1996, \r\n  and finding it unseverable from the remainder of the Act.  Because the legislature \r\n  has substantially amended this provision, we vacate the order of the circuit \r\n  court.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1996, appellant/respondent Lighthouse Charter School Committee (Lighthouse) \r\n  submitted to respondent/appellant (Board) an application for a local charter \r\n  school on Hilton Head Island.  The Board denied the application on the ground \r\n  Lighthouse failed to meet several requirements of the Charter Schools Act, including \r\n  the racial composition requirement found in the original version of Â§\r\n59-40-50(B)(6) \r\n  which provided in pertinent part:  &quot;under no circumstances may a charter school \r\n  enrollment differ from the racial composition of the school district by more \r\n  than ten percent.&quot;\r\nThe case first reached this Court on appeal in 1999.  We  affirmed the denial \r\n  of Lighthouse's application but remanded for the circuit court to consider whether \r\n  the racial composition requirement was unconstitutional as a violation of equal \r\n  protection.  Beaufort County Bd. of Educ. v. Lighthouse Charter Sch. Comm., \r\n  335 S.C. 230, 516 S.E.2d 655 (1999).  On remand, the circuit court found the \r\n  racial composition requirement of Â§\r\n59-40-50(B)(6) violated equal protection \r\n  and this provision was not severable from the remainder of the Act.  Accordingly, \r\n  the Charter Schools Act in its entirety was declared unconstitutional.  \r\nLighthouse and the Attorney General appealed the circuit\r\ncourt's ruling on \r\n  severability; the Board cross-appealed on the constitutional issue.  While the \r\n  appeal was pending, 2002 S.C. Act No. 265 was signed by the Governor on May \r\n  20, 2002.  This Act amended the Charter Schools Act by adding a severability \r\n  clause but did not change the existing racial composition requirement.  On July \r\n  1, 2002, however, the Governor signed a second Act, 2002 S.C. Act No. 341, which \r\n  rewrote several provisions of the Charter Schools Act including the racial composition \r\n  requirement originally found in Â§ 59-40-50(B)(6).  Under Act No. 341, the Charter \r\n  Schools Act now provides:\r\n          Â§ 59-40-50(B)  A charter school must:\r\n\r\n          (7) admit all \r\n  children eligible to attend public school in a school district to a charter \r\n  school operating in that school district, subject to space limitations.  However, \r\n  it is required that the racial composition of the charter school enrollment \r\n  reflect that of the school district or that of the targeted student population \r\n  which the charter school proposes to serve, to be defined for the purposes of \r\n  this chapter as differing by no more than twenty percent from that population.  \r\n  This requirement is also subject to the provisions of Section 59-40-70(D).  \r\n  If the number of applications exceeds the capacity of a program, class, grade \r\n  level, or building, students must be accepted by lot, and there is no appeal \r\n  to the sponsor.\r\n\r\nFurther, the new Act provides under Â§ 59-40-70(D):\r\n\r\nIn the event that the racial composition of an applicantâ€™s \r\n  or charter schoolâ€™s enrollment differs from the enrollment of the local school \r\n  district or the targeted student population by more than twenty percent, despite \r\n  its best efforts, the local school district board shall consider the applicantâ€™s \r\n  or the charter schoolâ€™s recruitment efforts and racial composition of the applicant \r\n  pool in determining whether the applicant or charter school is operating in \r\n  a nondiscriminatory manner.  A finding by the local school district board \r\n  that the applicant or charter school is operating in a racially discriminatory \r\n  manner may justify the denial of a charter school application or the revocation \r\n  of a charter as provided herein or in Section 59-40-110, as may be applicable.  \r\n  A finding by the local school district board that the applicant is not operating \r\n  in a racially discriminatory manner shall justify approval of the charter without \r\n  regard to the racial percentage requirement if the application is acceptable \r\n  in all other aspects.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  This second amendment also includes a \r\n  severability clause. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhat effect do the amendments to the Charter Schools Act \r\n  have on this case challenging the constitutionality of the original racial composition \r\n  clause?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAct No. 341 applies generally to the â€œorganization, \r\n  operation, and governanceâ€ of all charter schools.  As the latest enactment, \r\n  it is the controlling legislation governing the charter application process \r\n  and pre-existing charter schools.  See Iâ€™On L.L.C.  v. Town of Mt. \r\n  Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (later legislation takes precedence \r\n  over earlier).  The racial composition provision originally found in Â§ 59-40-50(B) \r\n  has been superseded, not only here where Lighthouse is still in the application \r\n  process, but also regarding existing schools which must comply with Act No. \r\n  341 as well.  Accordingly, there is no reason for us to issue an opinion ruling \r\n  on the constitutionality of the original racial composition provision.\r\nFurther, the new provisions regarding racial composition, Â§Â§ 59-40-50(B)(7) \r\n  and -70(D), are substantially different in effect from the original provision.  \r\n  The original provision stated that â€œunder no circumstancesâ€ could the racial \r\n  composition of a charter school differ by more than ten percent from the district \r\n  population.  Under Act No. 341, the provision found in Â§ 59-40-70(D) excuses \r\n  the new twenty-percent racial composition requirement entirely if the charter \r\n  school is not operating in a racially discriminatory manner.  These new provisions \r\n  have changed the character of the racial composition requirement by injecting \r\n  a fact-based determination regarding discrimination rather than mandating a \r\n  straightforward racial quota.  \r\nBecause the original provision under which this case was brought is no longer \r\n  applicable and the new requirements under Act No. 341 are substantially different, \r\n  we vacate the order of the circuit court and dismiss this appeal as moot.  Cf. \r\n  Peterson Outdoor Advertising Corp. v. Beaufort County, 291 S.C. 533, \r\n  354 S.E.2d 563 (1987) (repeal or amendment of zoning ordinance during appeal \r\n  renders the appeal moot).  Lighthouse may continue the application process under \r\n  the applicable provisions of Act No. 341. \r\nVACATED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25584","title":"Greenville County v.

We affirm.\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGreenville County (â€œthe Countyâ€) \r\n  brought lawsuits against appellants to enforce the Countyâ€™s ordinance regulating \r\n  the location of sexually oriented businesses.  The trial court granted summary \r\n  judgment in favor of the County and enjoined appellants from operating their \r\n  businesses.  In addition, the trial court granted the County summary judgment \r\n  on appellantsâ€™ counterclaims.  Appellants Kenwood Enterprises, Inc., and Elephant, \r\n  Inc., d/b/a Platinum Plus, and Ken Wood (collectively â€œPlatinum Plusâ€) and HH&amp;M, \r\n  Inc., and First Five Management, Inc., d/b/a Heartbreakers (collectively â€œHeartbreakersâ€) \r\n  together have filed a brief raising several issues on appeal.  Appellant Pretty \r\n  Woman, Inc., d/b/a Diamonds (â€œDiamondsâ€) filed a separate brief raising a single \r\n  issue.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 7, 1995, the County enacted \r\n  Greenville County Zoning Ordinance No. 2673 (â€œthe Ordinanceâ€).  The Ordinance \r\n  established both a licensing scheme and location restrictions for sexually oriented \r\n  businesses.  Several adult businesses (but none of the appellants in the instant \r\n  case) challenged the constitutionality of the Ordinance in Harkins v. Greenville \r\n  County, 340 S.C. 606, 533 S.E.2d 886 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. \r\n  1125 (2001), and the Harkins Court invalidated the licensing portion \r\n  of the ordinance.  The Harkins opinion initially was filed on April 24, \r\n  2000.  On June 12, 2000, the Court withdrew the April 24 opinion, denied a petition \r\n  for rehearing, and refiled the opinion, stating that the â€œConclusion section \r\n  of the initial opinion has been clarified so that only the licensing \r\n  portion of the Greenville County Ordinance is declared unconstitutional.â€  Id. \r\n  at 611, 533 S.E.2d at 888 (emphasis added).  In August 2000, the County instituted \r\n  the instant actions against appellants.\r\nThe Ordinance states that County Council considered, \r\n  inter alia, several summaries of other citiesâ€™ land use studies as well \r\n  as court cases including City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 \r\n  U.S. 41 (1986).  Based on these materials, County Council concluded that â€œin \r\n  areas surrounding adult&#8209;oriented entertainment establishments crime increases, \r\n  property values decrease, and the quality of life for residents declines.â€  \r\n  Moreover, the â€œPurpose and Intentâ€ section of the Ordinance provides as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this ordinance \r\n  to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, \r\n  and general welfare of the citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable \r\n  and uniform regulations to prevent the continued deleterious location and concentration \r\n  of sexually oriented businesses within the county.  The provisions of this ordinance \r\n  have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction \r\n  on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials.  \r\n  Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny \r\n  access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, \r\n  or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment \r\n  to their intended marketâ€¦\r\n\r\nSection 12 of the Ordinance governs the location \r\n  of sexually oriented businesses, and subsection (a) provides that all sexually \r\n  oriented businesses shall be located in an S-1 district.  Subsection (b) establishes \r\n  a 1500-foot setback requirement such that a sexually oriented business cannot \r\n  be located within 1500 feet of nine enumerated types of properties, including \r\n  a church, school, boundary of a residential district, and property line of a \r\n  lot devoted primarily to residential use.  Subsection (c) states that a sexually \r\n  oriented business cannot be within 1500 feet of another sexually oriented business.  \r\n  In subsection (i), the provisions, with the exception of subsection (a), are \r\n  made applicable to â€œthose areas of the county that are not zoned.â€ \r\n  [1] \r\n Initially, the Ordinance \r\n  was proposed and drafted as an amendment to the Countyâ€™s Zoning Ordinance (â€œZoning \r\n  Ordinanceâ€). [2]   Ultimately, \r\n  however, the Ordinance was not passed as an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, \r\n  but instead was passed as a stand-alone ordinance applicable to both the zoned \r\n  and unzoned areas of the County.  John Owings, Jr., of the Countyâ€™s Planning \r\n  Commission, explained that if the Ordinance had been applied only to the zoned \r\n  areas of the County, then it would have encouraged the location and possible \r\n  concentration of adult businesses on the edge of the zoned areas.  Thus, Owings \r\n  advised that the Ordinance should be county&#8209;wide and not as an amendment \r\n  to the Zoning Ordinance. [3] \r\nThe Ordinance was given \r\n  a first and second reading.  At the recommendation of the Planning Commission, \r\n  a workshop was held between the second and third reading.  Upon the third reading, \r\n  the Ordinanceâ€™s location requirement, originally drafted at 1000 feet, was amended \r\n  to the 1500-foot requirement, and then County Council adopted the Ordinance \r\n  as amended.\r\nPlatinum Plus, Heartbreakers, \r\n  and Diamonds are all â€œsexually oriented businesses,â€ as that term is defined \r\n  by the Ordinance. [4]   Platinum \r\n  Plus and Heartbreakers are both located in an S-1 district and did not exist \r\n  when the Ordinance was enacted.  Although located in an S-1 district, both Platinum \r\n  Plus and Heartbreakers violate the Ordinanceâ€™s 1500-foot location requirement.  \r\n  Diamonds is located in a C&#8209;2 district and is in violation of the \r\n  1500-foot location requirement.  Because Diamonds was in existence when the \r\n  Ordinance was enacted, it was entitled to a one-year moratorium pursuant to \r\n  Section 12(g) of the Ordinance.\r\nPlatinum Plus leased a building \r\n  in late 1999 and intended to open a nightclub.  At the Countyâ€™s request, Platinum \r\n  Plus advised the County Code Enforcement Administrator, Peter Nomikos, in December \r\n  1999 that it did not intend to operate an adult business at its location.  However, \r\n  after the initial Harkins decision was filed, Platinum Plus met with \r\n  County representatives and was told that the Ordinance had been declared unconstitutional.  \r\n  Platinum Plus was issued a temporary certificate of occupancy on June 30, 2000, \r\n  which indicated the business was going to be a nightclub only.  In a July 27, \r\n  2000, letter, Platinum Plus was notified by Nomikos that the substituted Harkins \r\n  opinion upheld the Ordinanceâ€™s location provisions and that Platinum Plus would \r\n  be prohibited from being operated as a sexually oriented business.  On August \r\n  9, 2000, Platinum Plus responded stating the intent to open as a nightclub.\r\nPlatinum Plus alleged in its answer \r\n  that it relied on the representations made by the County that there was no ordinance \r\n  regulating sexually oriented businesses and modified its renovation plans, spending \r\n  over $750,000 to construct Platinum Plus as an adult nightclub.  Thus, Platinum \r\n  Plus asserted that the County should be estopped from enforcing the Ordinance \r\n  against it.  In addition, Platinum Plus asserted a claim of gross negligence \r\n  against the County and sought money damages.\r\nHeartbreakers also had a certificate \r\n  of occupancy issued to it during the time period between the two Harkins \r\n  opinions.  Nomikos testified that the certificate of occupancy was issued with \r\n  the knowledge that Heartbreakers was going to operate as a sexually oriented \r\n  business, but at a time when he mistakenly believed that the Ordinance had been \r\n  declared unconstitutional by this Court.  Heartbreakers alleged estoppel against \r\n  the County and sought money damages.\r\nAPPEAL OF PLATINUM PLUS \r\n  AND HEARTBREAKERS\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1. Did the trial court err in finding that the Ordinance was properly \r\n  enacted pursuant to the Countyâ€™s police power and thus did not need to be enacted \r\n  pursuant to the Comprehensive Planning Act?\r\n2.  Is the Ordinanceâ€™s location \r\n  requirement constitutional?\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in finding the County \r\n  was not estopped from enforcing the Ordinance?\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in granting summary \r\n  judgment on the counterclaims?\r\n  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in quashing the subpoenas \r\n  for County Council members?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.  The Ordinance Was Properly Enacted\r\nThe trial court ruled that the \r\n  Ordinance was properly enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the \r\n  County by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-25 (Supp. 2001). \r\n  [5]   Further, the trial court found that the Ordinance is not part of the \r\n  Zoning Ordinance and did not have to be enacted pursuant to the South Carolina \r\n  Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act of 1994, S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 6-29-310 et seq. (Supp. 2001) (â€œComprehensive Planning Actâ€). \r\nPlatinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  argue that the trial court erred because the Ordinance is clearly a zoning ordinance.  \r\n  Furthermore, they argue that if the Ordinance is not a zoning ordinance, it \r\n  should be â€œstruck down as an illegal land use control actâ€ because the County \r\n  cannot enact such ordinances unless it complies with the Comprehensive Planning \r\n  Act.  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court correctly \r\n  concluded that the Ordinance was not part of the Countyâ€™s Zoning Ordinance.  \r\n  This does not mean, however, that the Ordinance itself could not fairly be characterized, \r\n  in general terms, as a zoning ordinance. \r\n  [6]   The real issue is whether this type of ordinance must be adopted pursuant \r\n  to the Comprehensive Planning Act.  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that this type of ordinance may be adopted pursuant to the Countyâ€™s general \r\n  police powers and that the Comprehensive Planning Act does not, in effect, preempt \r\n  this particular type of local legislation.\r\nâ€œIn order to pre-empt an entire \r\n  field, an act must make manifest a legislative intent that no other enactment \r\n  may touch upon the subject in any way.â€  Bugsyâ€™s, Inc. v. City of Myrtle \r\n  Beach, 340 S.C. 87, 94, 530 S.E.2d 890, 893 (2000); accord Town \r\n  of Hilton Head Island v. Fine Liquors, Ltd., 302 S.C. 550, 397 S.E.2d 662 \r\n  (1990) (same).\r\nIn Fine Liquors, we \r\n  held that while the Legislature gave the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission \r\n  the sole and exclusive authority to regulate the sale of beer, wine, and alcohol, \r\n  it had not preempted the field to preclude Hilton Head from passing a zoning \r\n  ordinance which prohibited internally illuminated â€œred dotâ€ signs.  Similarly, \r\n  in Bugsyâ€™s, we held that the Legislatureâ€™s enactment of a comprehensive \r\n  regulatory scheme for video poker did not preempt a municipality from enacting \r\n  a zoning ordinance that also regulated video poker.   We commented as follows \r\n  in Bugsyâ€™s:\r\n\r\n[W]hile the General Assembly \r\n  has enacted a comprehensive scheme regulating many aspects of video poker machines, \r\n  the scheme does not manifest an intent to prohibit any other enactment from \r\n  touching on video poker machines.  State regulation of video poker machines \r\n  does not preclude a municipality from passing a zoning ordinance which impacts \r\n  businesses which have video game pokerâ€¦\r\n\r\nBugsyâ€™s, 340 S.C. at 94, \r\n  530 S.E.2d at 893.\r\nIn the instant case, \r\n  while the Comprehensive Planning Act governs zoning, it simply does not evince \r\n  a legislative intent to completely prohibit any other local enactments from \r\n  touching upon zoning or land use.  See id.  That fact, in conjunction \r\n  with the liberal reading we are required to give section 4-9-25, compels us \r\n  to conclude that this type of ordinance may be properly enacted pursuant to \r\n  the Countyâ€™s police powers.\r\nWe note that North Carolina \r\n  has addressed this issue under similar circumstances and arrived at the same \r\n  conclusion.  In Onslow County v. Moore, 499 S.E.2d 780 (N.C. Ct. App.), \r\n  review denied, 525 S.E.2d 453 (N.C. 1998), the appellants argued that \r\n  a county ordinance regulating the location of sexually oriented businesses was \r\n  â€œa zoning ordinance, and as such is invalid since it was not adopted pursuant \r\n  to a comprehensive zoning plan for the County.â€  Id. at 784.  The North \r\n  Carolina Court of Appeals held that â€œâ€˜[c]ounties may enact ordinances regulating \r\n  land use in two fashions:  one, pursuant to a comprehensive zoning plan, â€¦ and\r\ntwo, \r\n  pursuant to their police powersâ€¦â€™â€  Id. at 785 (quoting Maynor v. \r\n  Onslow County, 488 S.E.2d 289 (N.C. Ct. App.), appeal dismissed, \r\n  493 S.E.2d 458, cert. denied, 496 S.E.2d 385 (N.C. 1997)) (internal citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nThe trial court relied \r\n  on both Maynor v. Onslow County and Onslow County v. Moore and \r\n  we find that reliance appropriate.  \r\nFurthermore, we note the Comprehensive \r\n  Planning Act does not require that counties zone their entire area.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 6-29-330 (Supp. 2001) (â€œA county may exercise the powers granted \r\n  under the provisions of this chapter in the total unincorporated area or \r\n  specific parts of the unincorporated area.â€) (emphasis added).  Thus, the \r\n  Act envisions that a county may, like the County in the instant case, have both \r\n  zoned and unzoned areas.  If we accepted Platinum Plus and Heartbreakersâ€™ contention \r\n  that any land use regulation not enacted pursuant to the Comprehensive Planning \r\n  Act is unlawful, the effect would be to disallow a county from regulating its \r\n  unzoned land in any way.  We find the Legislature clearly could not have intended \r\n  that result.  Instead, it is logical that the County should be able to enact, \r\n  pursuant to its police powers, one ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses \r\n  and have the ordinance apply to both zoned and unzoned areas.\r\n Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  also contend that the detailed specifications set out in the Comprehensive Planning \r\n  Act, see Â§Â§ 6-29-710 through -960, indicate the only way a County can \r\n  regulate land use is through a comprehensive plan; they cite Iâ€™On, L.L.C. \r\n  v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000), in support \r\n  of their argument.  \r\nThe Iâ€™On Court was faced \r\n  with the issue of whether zoning by initiative and referendum is allowed in \r\n  South Carolina.  The Court concluded that the detailed nature of zoning acts \r\n  like the Comprehensive Planning Act â€œindicates a legislative intent that zoning \r\n  matters must be decided only in the manner specified in those acts.â€  Id. \r\n  at 415, 526 S.E.2d at 721.  Iâ€™On held that by passing the Comprehensive \r\n  Planning Act, the Legislature did not intend to allow voters to enact more complex \r\n  zoning measures by initiative and referendum.  Significantly, the Court stated \r\n  the following:\r\n\r\n[T]he comprehensive and detailed \r\n  nature of [the Comprehensive Planning Actâ€™s] provisions â€¦ reveals our Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intent that zoning decisions should be made by a cross-section of unbiased \r\n  officials after careful deliberation.  Whether the zoning decisions involve \r\n  the development of an overall zoning system or master plan, or the application \r\n  of established rules in a particular case, [the Comprehensive Planning Act] \r\n  is designed to allow ample planning and ensure due process for all interested \r\n  parties.\r\n\r\nId. at 416, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  at 721 (emphasis added).\r\n Iâ€™On does not \r\n  stand for the proposition that any ordinance affecting land use must \r\n  be part of the comprehensive plan and enacted pursuant to the Comprehensive \r\n  Planning Act.  Instead, Iâ€™On simply held that land use regulation cannot \r\n  be effected via the referendum and initiative process.  Thus, Iâ€™On is \r\n  not dispositive.  To accept Platinum Plus and Heartbreakersâ€™ expansive reading \r\n  of Iâ€™On would necessarily eviscerate a Countyâ€™s ability to exercise its \r\n  police power if that exercise in any way impacted land use.  Moreover, we note \r\n  that in the instant case, the Ordinance was passed â€œby a cross-section of unbiased \r\n  officials after careful deliberation,â€ with the involvement of the County Planning \r\n  Commission, and therefore does not run afoul of the dangers with which Iâ€™On \r\n  was concerned.  See id. at 416-17, 526 S.E.2d at 721 (indicating \r\n  that an initiative and referendum process could result â€œin arbitrary decisions \r\n  and patchwork zoning with little rhyme or reasonâ€).\r\nIn sum, the Comprehensive \r\n  Planning Act does not preempt passage of the Ordinance outside of the Countyâ€™s \r\n  Zoning Ordinance. See Bugsyâ€™s, supra; Fine Liquors, \r\n  supra.  Therefore, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s holding that the County \r\n  permissibly enacted the Ordinance pursuant to its police powers. \r\n  [7]   See Â§ 4-9-25; Onslow County v. Moore, supra; \r\n  Maynor v. Onslow County, supra.\r\n2. \r\n  The Ordinanceâ€™s Location Requirement is Constitutional\r\nPlatinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  argue that the Ordinance is unconstitutional because it violates:  (1) Article \r\n  VIII, section 14 of the South Carolina Constitution; and (2) the First Amendment \r\n  of the U.S. Constitution.  We disagree.\r\nFirst, Platinum Plus \r\n  and Heartbreakers contend that this Courtâ€™s decisions in Diamonds v. Greenville \r\n  County, 325 S.C. 154, 480 S.E.2d 718 (1997), and Connor v. Town of Hilton \r\n  Head, 314 S.C. 251, 442 S.E.2d 608 (1994), apply to the instant case.  In \r\n  both Diamonds and Connor, the Court held ordinances which were \r\n  absolute bans unconstitutional; in Diamonds, Greenville County \r\n  banned public nudity, and in Connor, Hilton Head banned nude dancing.  \r\n  The Court found in both cases that Article VIII, Â§ 14 of the South Carolina \r\n  Constitution prohibited a municipality from proscribing conduct that is not \r\n  unlawful under State criminal laws governing the same subject.  Because state \r\n  criminal laws addressing the subject of public nudity did not prohibit all public \r\n  nudity, or nude dancing, the ordinances at issue criminalized conduct that was \r\n  not unlawful under State law.  Therefore, the Court concluded that Greenville \r\n  County and Hilton Head had exceeded their power in enacting the ordinances.\r\nIn the instant case, \r\n  however, the Ordinance does not outright ban either nude dancing or sexually \r\n  oriented businesses.  Instead, it regulates the location of such businesses.  \r\n  Accordingly, Diamonds and Connor are clearly inapplicable. [8] \r\nPlatinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  next argue the Ordinance violates their First Amendment rights.  Primarily, \r\n  Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers maintain that the County was not justified in \r\n  increasing the location requirement from 1000 feet to 1500 feet because County \r\n  Council did not have any data to rely on for this increased distance.  Thus, \r\n  they claim the Ordinance is not â€œnarrowly tailored.â€\r\nPlatinum Plus and Heartbreakersâ€™ \r\n  First Amendment arguments are governed by the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s \r\n  decisions in City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), \r\n  and Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976).  These \r\n  decisions hold that ordinances designed to regulate the secondary effects of \r\n  sexually oriented businesses are content-neutral and are properly analyzed as \r\n  â€œtime, place, and mannerâ€ regulations.  See, e.g., Renton, \r\n  475 U.S. at 48 (regulations which are justified without reference to \r\n  the content of the regulated speech are â€œcontent neutralâ€); Centaur, Inc. \r\n  v. Richland County, 301 S.C. 374, 379, 392 S.E.2d 165, 168 (1990).  The \r\n  appropriate inquiry, [9]  therefore, \r\n  is whether the Ordinance â€œis designed to serve a substantial governmental interest \r\n  and allows for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.â€  Renton, \r\n  475 U.S. at 50; see also Harkins 340 S.C. at 614, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  at 890 (â€œsexually oriented business regulations will be upheld if they are designed \r\n  to serve the substantial governmental interest of preventing harmful secondary \r\n  effects and they allow for reasonable avenues of communicationâ€).  \r\nThe Ordinance clearly meets the \r\n  Renton standard.  The Countyâ€™s interest in combating the secondary effects \r\n  of sexually oriented businesses is, undoubtedly, a substantial one.  See \r\n  Renton, 475 U.S. at 50 (â€œA cityâ€™s â€˜interest in attempting to preserve \r\n  the quality of urban life is one that must be accorded high respect.â€™â€) (citation \r\n  omitted).  Moreover, we note that in Harkins, the Court specifically \r\n  decided that the Ordinance did not â€œzone the adult businesses out of existence.â€  \r\n  Harkins, 340 S.C. at 620-21, 533 S.E.2d at 893.\r\nNonetheless, Platinum Plus and \r\n  Heartbreakers maintain that the County lacked evidence for the 1500-foot requirement.  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe First Amendment requires only \r\n  that whatever evidence the County relies upon is â€œreasonably believed to be \r\n  relevant to the problemâ€ the County is addressing.  Renton, 475 U.S. \r\n  at 51-52.  â€œThis is not to say that a municipality can get away with shoddy \r\n  data or reasoning.  The municipalityâ€™s evidence must fairly support the municipalityâ€™s \r\n  rationale for its ordinance.â€  Alameda Books, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 122 \r\n  S.Ct. 1728, 1736 (2002) (plurality opinion).  Furthermore, the County â€œâ€˜must \r\n  be allowed a reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to admittedly \r\n  serious problems.â€™â€  Renton, 475 U.S. at 52 (quoting American Mini \r\n  Theatres, 427 U.S. at 71).\r\nHere, the County relied upon, \r\n  inter alia, several summaries of other citiesâ€™ secondary effects studies \r\n  as well as the Renton decision itself.  The evidence that County Council \r\n  relied upon clearly supports its rationale for the ordinance.  For instance, \r\n  the Los Angeles study recommended more than 1000 feet separating sexually oriented \r\n  businesses from one another and a minimum of 500 feet separation from schools, \r\n  parks, churches, and residential areas.  Thus, Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  are simply incorrect when they maintain there is not data in the studies to \r\n  justify the 1500-foot requirement.  Furthermore, it is undisputed that the record \r\n  in the instant case reveals the County Planning Commission considered both the \r\n  1000-foot and 1500-foot requirements and concluded that, with either distance, \r\n  there was a reasonable opportunity for these businesses to locate in the County.\r\nAs Justice Kennedy observed in \r\n  Alameda Books:\r\n\r\nIt is well documented that multiple \r\n  adult businesses in close proximity may change the character of a neighborhood \r\n  for the worse. Those same businesses spread across the city may not have the \r\n  same deleterious effects. At least in theory, a dispersal ordinance causes these \r\n  businesses to separate rather than to close, so negative externalities are diminished \r\n  but speech is not.\r\n\r\nAlameda Books, Â­Â­Â­___ U.S. \r\n  at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1740 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  The County \r\n  in this case has chosen to disperse sexually oriented businesses with a 1500-foot \r\n  requirement.  In our opinion, the County is free â€œto experimentâ€ with this distance \r\n  provided that reasonable avenues of communication remain.  Renton, supra.\r\nIn sum, we find the \r\n  Ordinance is constitutional. [10] \r\n  \r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe County Is Not \r\n  Estopped from Enforcing the Ordinance  \r\nPlatinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  argue that the County should be estopped from enforcing the Ordinance against \r\n  them because they received certificates of occupancy in between the time the \r\n  original Harkins decision and the clarified Harkins decision were \r\n  filed.  We disagree.\r\nAs a general rule, \r\n  estoppel does not lie against the government to prevent the due exercise of \r\n  its police power or to thwart the application of public policy.  Grant v. \r\n  City of Folly Beach, 346 S.C. 74, 551 S.E.2d 229, (2001); South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 275 S.C. 176, 268 S.E.2d 282 (1980).  However, \r\n  this does not mean that estoppel cannot ever apply against a government agency.  \r\n  See, e.g., Landing Dev. Corp. v. City of Myrtle Beach, \r\n  285 S.C. 216, 329 S.E.2d 423 (1985).  To prove estoppel against the government, \r\n  the relying party must prove:  (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge \r\n  of the truth as to the facts in question, (2) justifiable reliance upon \r\n  the governmentâ€™s conduct, and (3) a prejudicial change in position.  E.g., \r\n  Grant, supra.\r\nPlatinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  argue that because the County issued certain permits to them, the County should \r\n  be estopped from enforcing the ordinance.  This Court recently rejected a similar \r\n  argument in Grant.  See Grant, 346 S.C. at 82, 551 S.E.2d \r\n  at 233 (issuance of a building permit did not estop the City since Grant had \r\n  the means to ascertain the flood limitations on his building).\r\nPlatinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  also contend that because Nomikos and other County officials communicated to \r\n  them that the Ordinance had been declared unconstitutional by this Court and \r\n  therefore there was no ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses, the \r\n  County is estopped from enforcing the ordinance.  However, we hold that estoppel \r\n  against the County does not lie under the unusual facts of this case.\r\nâ€œThe general rule is that administrative \r\n  officers of the state cannot estop the state through mistaken statements of \r\n  law.â€  Kelso &amp; Irwin, P.A. v. State Ins. Fund, 997 P.2d 591, 599 \r\n  (Idaho 2000) (citing Austin v. Austin, 350 So.2d 102, 105 (Fla.Ct.App. \r\n  1977); Rainaldi v. Public Emp. Retirement Bd., 115 N.M. 650, 857 P.2d \r\n  761, 769 (1993)); see also Earl Township v. Reading Broad., \r\n  Inc., 770 A.2d 794, 798 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2001), appeal denied, 793 \r\n  A.2d 910 (Pa. 2002) (where the Townshipâ€™s solicitor expressed his legal opinion \r\n  that the broadcasting company was not required to obtain a permit for the construction \r\n  of a new television broadcasting tower, the court held that the mutual mistake \r\n  of law, as opposed to a mistake of fact, would not support a claim of estoppel); \r\n  see generally 28 Am.Jur.2d Estoppel and Waiver Â§ 142 (1966) \r\n  (â€œIn general, an estoppel cannot be asserted against a government entity based \r\n  on mistaken statements of lawâ€¦.â€); 31 C.J.S. Estoppel and Waiver Â§ 91 \r\n  (1996) (representations or opinions on matters of law not generally basis for \r\n  estoppel).\r\nThe Countyâ€™s representation that \r\n  the Ordinance had been declared completely unconstitutional was obviously \r\n  a statement of law, and therefore cannot be the basis for estoppel.  Id.  \r\n  The instant case is a perfect example of why estoppel against the government \r\n  should not be based on an erroneous statement of the law, because neither the \r\n  County nor the appellants could have had â€œthe means of knowledge of the truthâ€ \r\n  while the Harkins opinion was on rehearing.  Thus, we find the County \r\n  should not be estopped based on its misunderstanding of the law handed \r\n  down by this Court, which was subsequently clarified by this Court on \r\n  denial of a petition for rehearing. [11]   \r\nAn estoppel claim against the \r\n  County for representations made in between the two Harkins opinions is \r\n  simply unavailable as a matter of law.  Accordingly, the trial court correctly \r\n  granted summary judgment to the County on the estoppel claims.\r\n4.  Summary Judgment Was Properly Granted on the Counterclaims\r\nNext, Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on their counterclaims \r\n  because there were disputed material issues of fact which preclude summary judgment.  \r\n  In our opinion, however, these fact findings are either clearly undisputed or \r\n  not material to resolution of the issues.  See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (judgment \r\n  shall be rendered â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \r\n  and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of lawâ€).  In addition, we agree with the County that \r\n  Platinum Plus has not appealed several of the trial courtâ€™s rulings which preclude, \r\n  as a matter of law, its negligence claim. [12]   E.g., ML-Lee Acquisition \r\n  Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 489 S.E.2d 470 (1997) \r\n  (unappealed ruling is the law of the case).\r\n5.  \r\n  The Trial Court Properly Quashed the Subpoenas for County Council Members\r\nPlatinum Plus and Heartbreakers \r\n  sought to take depositions of those who were members of County Council when \r\n  the Ordinance was passed.  The trial court granted the Countyâ€™s request to quash \r\n  the subpoenas.  Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers argue this was error because \r\n  they were entitled to discover from the Council members whether the Ordinance \r\n  was designed to prevent harmful secondary effects.  We disagree. [13] \r\n In Bear Enterprises v. County of Greenville, \r\n  319 S.C. 137, 459 S.E.2d 883 (Ct. App. 1995), the Court of Appeals commented \r\n  on the propriety of using Council membersâ€™ deposition testimony regarding their \r\n  decisions:\r\n\r\nWe note that Bear deposed Council members and presented \r\n  their testimony as evidence to support Bearâ€™s argument that Councilâ€™s decision \r\n  [against rezoning] was arbitrary.  We are aware of no authority allowing someone \r\n  challenging action by Council to interrogate members individually to impeach \r\n  Councilâ€™s decision.  The governing body of a municipality acts as a collective \r\n  body, not as individuals, and decisions made in this fashion are the product \r\n  of debate and compromise.  If individuals are not satisfied with decisions made \r\n  by members of a municipal government within the limits of the law, their remedy \r\n  is at the polls, not the courts.  Although we feel it was inappropriate to examine \r\n  Council members in this manner, the County did not object to the procedure in \r\n  this case.\r\n\r\nBear Enterprises v. County of Greenville, 319 S.C. \r\n  137, 139 n.1, 459 S.E.2d 883, 885 n.1 (Ct. App. 1995).  Moreover, the Supreme \r\n  Court in Renton made clear that an â€œalleged illicit legislative motiveâ€ \r\n  to suppress protected speech is not a proper basis for finding a statute unconstitutional.  \r\n  475 U.S. at 47-48 (citation omitted); see also United States \r\n  v. Oâ€™Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 383 (1968) (â€œInquiries into congressional motives \r\n  or purposes are a hazardous matter.â€).\r\nWhat County Council membersâ€™ motivations were for passing \r\n  the Ordinance simply is not a proper inquiry.  Id.; Bear Enterprises, \r\n  supra.  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in quashing the subpoenas.\r\nAPPEAL OF DIAMONDS\r\nUnlike Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers, Diamonds \r\n  was in operation at the time the Ordinance was passed.  It therefore fell under \r\n  Section 12(g) of the Ordinance which provides in part:  â€œAny sexually oriented \r\n  business lawfully operating on the effective date of this ordinance that is \r\n  in violation of subsection[s] (a) through (f) of this section shall be deemed \r\n  a nonconforming use.  The nonconforming use will be permitted to continue for \r\n  a period not to exceed one (1) yearâ€¦â€  Pursuant to this subsection, Diamonds \r\n  was supposed to cease operating as a sexually oriented business by February \r\n  7, 1996.  However, because of the Harkins litigation, the County did \r\n  not begin to enforce the Ordinance until August 2000, when the County sought \r\n  an injunction against Diamonds.  Diamonds counterclaimed for injunctive and \r\n  declaratory relief alleging that the Ordinance is unconstitutional.  The trial \r\n  court granted summary judgment in the Countyâ€™s favor on all claims.\r\nIn its statement of the issue on appeal, Diamonds argues \r\n  that the Ordinance is unconstitutional as an impermissible taking because â€œit \r\n  divests nonconforming use rights, which, under statutory law, may only be divested \r\n  by zoning provisions.â€  Diamonds appears to assert that because the Ordinance \r\n  is not a â€œzoning ordinance,â€ it cannot create a nonconforming use since a nonconforming \r\n  use may only be accomplished via a zoning regulation enacted pursuant to the \r\n  Comprehensive Planning Act.  See Â§ 6-29-730.\r\nWe reject Diamondsâ€™ argument, because, as discussed above, \r\n  the Comprehensive Planning Act does not preempt the County from enacting an \r\n  ordinance, pursuant to its police power, which impacts land use.  Moreover, \r\n  no taking has occurred since Diamonds â€œcan continue in its existing location, \r\n  the only restriction is that it cannot operate as an adult useâ€¦â€  Restaurant \r\n  Row Associates v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 218, 516 S.E.2d 442, 447, \r\n  cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1020 (1999).  Therefore, Diamonds cannot contend \r\n  that the Ordinance has deprived it of all economically viable use of its land.  \r\n  See, e.g., Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v. Stewart, 341 S.C. \r\n  297, 305-06, 534 S.E.2d 270, 274, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1029 (2000) \r\n  (if a land-use regulation substantially advances legitimate government interests \r\n  and does not deny the owner of all economically viable use of his land, it does \r\n  not constitute a taking).  \r\nAccordingly, Diamondsâ€™ argument that a taking has occurred \r\n  is without merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the \r\n  County on all claims is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice Diane S. Goodstein, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In Harkins, this Court recognized that when read together, \r\n    the subsections of Section 12 allowed sexually oriented businesses to locate \r\n    in the Countyâ€™s unzoned areas, in addition to S-1 districts.  Harkins, \r\n    340 S.C. at 620-21, 533 S.E.2d at 893.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The Countyâ€™s Zoning Ordinance is part of the Record \r\n    on Appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  We note, however, that language remained in the final version of \r\n    the Ordinance that the Zoning Ordinance was being amended.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Specifically, these businesses \r\n    all feature adult entertainment by persons â€œwho appear in a state of nudity,â€ \r\n    and therefore fall under the Ordinanceâ€™s definition of â€œadult cabaret.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [5]    This section, entitled â€œPowers of Counties,â€ provides \r\n    as follows:\r\n  \r\n  All counties of the State, in addition to the powers conferred \r\n    to their specific form of government, have authority to enact regulations, \r\n    resolutions, and ordinances, not inconsistent with the Constitution and \r\n    general law of this State, including the exercise of these powers in relation \r\n    to health and order in counties or respecting any subject as appears to them \r\n    necessary and proper for the security, general welfare, and convenience of \r\n    counties or for preserving health, peace, order, and good government in them.  \r\n    The powers of a county must be liberally construed in favor of the county \r\n    and the specific mention of particular powers may not be construed as limiting \r\n    in any manner the general powers of counties.\r\n  \r\n  Â§ 4-9-25 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Indeed, as Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers observe in their own Reply \r\n    Brief:  â€œThe mere fact that the County can enact land use ordinances under \r\n    its police power does not mean this ordinance is not a zoning ordinance.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [7]    Because we find the Ordinance is not part of the Countyâ€™s Zoning \r\n    Ordinance, it is unnecessary to rule on Platinum Plus and Heartbreakersâ€™ arguments \r\n    regarding the trial courtâ€™s alternative rulings.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  In other words, while the ordinances at issue in Diamonds \r\n    and Connor were content-based, the Ordinance in the instant case is \r\n    content-neutral.  See Connor, 314 S.C. at 255 n.2, 442 S.E.2d \r\n    at 610 n.2 (where the Court noted that because Hilton Headâ€™s ordinance targeted \r\n    the sexual or erotic message of nude dancing, the ordinance was not content-neutral, \r\n    and then contrasted that with an ordinance justified by reference to the secondary \r\n    effects of protected speech, which is content-neutral).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  Although the parties discuss the four-pronged standard of United \r\n    States v. Oâ€™Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), in this context, the Renton \r\n    standard is the appropriate one.  See International Eateries of \r\n    Am., Inc. v. Broward County, 941 F.2d 1157, 1161 n.2 (11th \r\n    Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 920 (1992) (noting the â€œconsiderable \r\n    confusionâ€ over whether to apply the Oâ€™Brien analysis or the Renton \r\n    analysis, but concluding that Renton applied where the regulation was \r\n    similar to that found in Renton, and in any event, that â€œthe answer \r\n    should be the same regardless of which analysis is usedâ€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [10]  Although Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers raise constitutional arguments \r\n    regarding both their â€œvested rightsâ€ and the Ordinanceâ€™s amortization period, \r\n    we decline to address them.  Because neither club was in existence at the \r\n    time the Ordinance was enacted, they have no standing to assert such arguments.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [11]  Furthermore, as Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers acknowledge in their \r\n    brief, they received the permits while the constitutionality of the Ordinance \r\n    was being questioned; hence, they had no right to rely on the misstatements \r\n    made by the County.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [12]  The trial court found Platinum Plusâ€™ counterclaims were barred by \r\n    the doctrine of illegality, the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, and the doctrine \r\n    of unclean hands.  The trial court also found no duty of care owed by the \r\n    County to Platinum Plus.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [13]  We reject the Countyâ€™s assertion that this issue is procedurally \r\n    barred because Platinum Plus and Heartbreakers failed to notice the appeal \r\n    of the trial courtâ€™s order quashing the subpoenas.  Because they are appealing \r\n    from a final judgment, this Court is permitted to review any intermediate \r\n    order or decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before appealed from.  \r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(1) (1976); Lancaster v.

McCulloch, Jr., of Columbia, Judith K. Appel and \r\n  Daniel N. Abrahamson, of Oakland, Susan King Dunn, of Charleston, and William \r\n  S. Bernstein, of New York, for amicus curiae. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:  Appellant, Regina McKnight \r\n  was convicted of homicide by child abuse; she was sentenced to twenty years, \r\n  suspended upon service of twelve years.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 15, 1999, McKnight gave birth to a stillborn \r\n  five-pound baby girl.  The babyâ€™s gestational age was estimated to be between \r\n  34-37 weeks old.  An autopsy revealed the presence of benzoylecgonine, a substance \r\n  which is metabolized by cocaine.  The pathologist, Dr. Proctor, testified that \r\n  the only way for the infant to have the substance present was through cocaine, \r\n  and that the cocaine had to have come from the mother. \r\n  [1]   Dr. Proctor testified that the baby died one to three days prior to \r\n  delivery.  Dr. Proctor determined the cause of death to be intrauterine fetal \r\n  demise with mild chorioamnionitis, funisitis [2]  and cocaine consumption.  He ruled the death \r\n  a homicide.  McKnight was indicted for homicide  by child abuse.  A first trial \r\n  held Jan. 8-12, 2002 resulted in a mistrial. [3]   At the second trial held May 14-16, 2001, the jury returned \r\n  a guilty verdict.  McKnight was sentenced to twenty years, suspended to service \r\n  of twelve years.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the Court err in refusing \r\n  to direct a verdict on the grounds that a) there was insufficient evidence of \r\n  the cause of death, b) there was no evidence of criminal intent, and c) there \r\n  was no evidence the baby was viable when McKnight ingested cocaine?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the Court err in refusing \r\n  to dismiss the homicide by child abuse indictment on the grounds that a) the \r\n  more specific criminal abortion statute governs, b) the statute does not apply \r\n  to the facts of this case, and c) the legislature did not intend the statute \r\n  to apply to fetuses?\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does application of the homicide by child abuse \r\n  statute to McKnight violate her due process right of adequate notice?\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does application of the homicide by child abuse \r\n  statute to McKnight violate her constitutional right to privacy?\r\n  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in refusing to dismiss the \r\n  indictment on eighth amendment cruel and unusual punishment grounds?\r\n  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does application of the homicide by child abuse \r\n  statute to McKnight violate equal protection?\r\n  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in refusing to exclude evidence \r\n  of the results of a urine specimen taken from McKnight shortly after the stillbirth, \r\n  on grounds that the specimen was obtained in violation of her fourth amendment \r\n  rights?\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDIRECTED VERDICT\r\nMcKnight asserts the trial court erred in refusing to direct \r\n  a verdict for her on the grounds that a) there was insufficient evidence of \r\n  the cause of death, b) there was no evidence of criminal intent, and c) there \r\n  was no evidence the baby was viable when McKnight ingested the cocaine.  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State \r\n  fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.  State v. McHoney, \r\n  344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).  In reviewing a motion for directed \r\n  verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of the evidence, not \r\n  with its weight.  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, \r\n  127 (2000).  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court \r\n  must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.  State v. \r\n  Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999).  If there is any \r\n  direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to \r\n  prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted \r\n  to the jury.  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d 526 (2000).\r\na.  Cause of Death\r\nMcKnight asserts the state failed to introduce \r\n  sufficient evidence demonstrating that cocaine caused the stillbirth.  We disagree. \r\n\r\n Dr. Proctor, who performed the autopsy \r\n  and who was qualified as an expert in criminal pathology, testified that the \r\n  only way for the infant to have benzoylecgonine present was through cocaine, \r\n  and that the cocaine had to have come from the mother.  Dr. Proctor determined \r\n  the cause of death to be intrauterine fetal demise with mild chorioamnionitis, \r\n  funisitis and cocaine consumption.  Dr. Proctor ruled the death a homicide.  \r\n\r\nAnother pathologist, Dr. Woodward, who was qualified \r\n  as an expert in pediatric pathology testified that the gestational age of the \r\n  infant was between 35-37 weeks, and that it was viable.  He then described how \r\n  one determines the cause of death of a viable fetus, by looking for abnormalities, \r\n  placental defects, infections, and the chemical constituency of the child.  \r\n  He explained the effect that cocaine would have on both an adult and a child. \r\n  He testified that the placenta was the major heart-lung machine while the baby \r\n  was inutero and that cocaine usage can produce degeneration of the small blood \r\n  vessels in the placenta.  He stated that he found areas of pinkish red degeneration \r\n  of the blood vessels which were consistent with cocaine exposure.  He testified \r\n  that he did not see any other indications of the cause of death, and found a \r\n  lack of evidence of other infections, lack of other abnormalities, otherwise \r\n  normal development of the child, itâ€™s size, weight, and lung development.  Although \r\n  Dr. Woodward agreed with Dr. Proctor that chorioamnionitis and mild funisitis \r\n  were present, he testified that to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, \r\n  those conditions had not caused the death of the infant.  He also opined that \r\n  neither syphilis, nor placental abruption killed the infant.  He concluded that, \r\n  to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the cause of death was intrauterine \r\n  cocaine exposure.  Although Woodward could not say the exact mechanism by which \r\n  the cocaine had killed the infant, he testified the â€œmechanisms through cardiac \r\n  function, placental functions, are seen as most probable.â€  On cross-exam, Woodward \r\n  testified that he believed the death was caused solely by the cocaine effect, \r\n  and that the drugs could have caused the babyâ€™s heart to stop, or to have caused \r\n  the babyâ€™s heart to rise precipitously putting the baby in congestive heart \r\n  failure.  He explained the lack of abnormalities in the heart found by Dr. Proctorâ€™s \r\n  autopsy, stating, â€œI wouldnâ€™t expect to see specific indices in the heart if \r\n  the heart just stopped or if the heart went into congestive heart failure.â€  \r\n  Finally, Woodward testified he had seen both children and adults dead with less \r\n  benzoylecgonine in their systems than McKnightâ€™s baby.  \r\nAlthough McKnightâ€™s expert, Dr. Conradi, would \r\n  not testify that cocaine had caused the stillbirth, she did testify that cocaine \r\n  had been in the baby at one point.  She also ruled out the possibility of chorioamnionitis, \r\n  funisitis or syphilis as the cause of death.  \r\nViewing the expert testimony in the light most favorable \r\n  to the state, we find sufficient evidence to withstand a directed verdict.  \r\n  McHoney, supra.  Any defect in the expert testimony went to its \r\n  weight, a defect McKnight was free to challenge with her own evidence.  \r\nb.  Criminal Intent\r\nMcKnight next asserts \r\n  she was entitled to a directed verdict as the state failed to prove she had \r\n  the requisite criminal intent to commit homicide  by child abuse.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85 (A), a person is \r\n  guilty of homicide  by child abuse if the person â€œcauses the death of a child \r\n  under the age of eleven while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death \r\n  occurs under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life.â€  \r\n  McKnight claims there is no evidence she acted with extreme indifference to \r\n  human life as there was no evidence of how likely cocaine is to cause stillbirth, \r\n  or that she knew the risk that her use of cocaine could result in the stillbirth \r\n  of her child. \r\nRecently, in State v. Jarrell, \r\n  350 S.C. 90, 97, 564 S.E.2d 362, 366 (Ct. App. 2002), the Court of Appeals defined \r\n  â€œextreme indifference,â€ as used in the homicide  by child abuse statute, stating:\r\n\r\nIn this state, indifference in the context of criminal statutes \r\n  has been compared to the conscious act of disregarding a risk which a person's \r\n  conduct has created, or a failure to exercise ordinary or due care.   See State \r\n  v. Rowell, 326 S.C. 313, 315, 487 S.E.2d 185, 186 (1997) (discussing the \r\n  requisite mental state for recklessness);  see generally Hooper v. \r\n  Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999) (&quot;Conduct of \r\n  the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly \r\n  be characterized as willful because it manifests a conscious indifference to \r\n  the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.&quot;).  \r\n  At least one other jurisdiction with a similar statute has found that &quot;[a] \r\n  person acts 'under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value \r\n  of human life' when he engages in deliberate conduct which culminates in the \r\n  death of some person.&quot;  Davis v. State, 325 Ark. 96, 925 S.W.2d \r\n  768, 773 (1996).  Therefore, we . . . hold that in the context of homicide by \r\n  abuse statutes, extreme indifference is a mental state akin to intent characterized \r\n  by a deliberate act culminating in death.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in reckless homicide  cases, we have \r\n  held that reckless disregard for the safety of others signifies an indifference \r\n  to the consequences of one's acts.  It denotes a conscious failure to exercise \r\n  due care or ordinary care or a conscious indifference to the rights and safety \r\n  of others or a reckless disregard thereof.  See State v. Tucker, \r\n  273 S.C. 736, 259 S.E.2d 414 (1979).\r\nIn Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 10, 492 S.E.2d 777, \r\n  782 (1997), cert. denied 523 U.S. 1145 (1998), this Court noted that \r\n  â€œalthough the precise effects of maternal crack use during pregnancy are somewhat \r\n  unclear, it is well documented and within the realm of public knowledge that \r\n  such use can cause serious harm to the viable unborn child.â€  Given this common \r\n  knowledge, Whitner was on notice that her conduct in utilizing cocaine during \r\n  pregnancy constituted child endangerment.  Id. at 16, 492 S.E.2d at 785.  \r\n  Indeed, more than twelve years ago, Justice Toal wrote:\r\n\r\nThe drug &quot;cocaine&quot; has torn at the very fabric \r\n  of our nation.  Families have been ripped apart, minds have been ruined, and \r\n  lives have been lost.  It is common knowledge that the drug is highly addictive \r\n  and potentially fatal.  The addictive nature of the drug, combined with its \r\n  expense, has caused our prisons to swell with those who have been motivated \r\n  to support their drug habit through criminal acts.  In some areas of the world, \r\n  entire governments have been undermined by the cocaine industry. \r\n\r\nState v. Ball, 301 S.C. 181, 391 S.E.2d 235 \r\n  (1990).  \r\nHere, it is undisputed that McKnight took cocaine \r\n  on numerous occasions while she was pregnant, that the urine sample taken immediately \r\n  after she gave birth had very high concentrations of cocaine, and that the baby \r\n  had benzoylecgonine in its system.  The DSS investigator who interviewed McKnight \r\n  shortly after the birth testified that McKnight admitted she knew she was pregnant \r\n  and that she had been using cocaine when she could get it, primarily on weekends.  \r\n  Given the fact that it is public knowledge that usage of cocaine is potentially \r\n  fatal, we find the fact that McKnight took cocaine knowing she was pregnant \r\n  was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury on whether she acted with extreme \r\n  indifference to her childâ€™s life.  Accordingly, the trial court correctly refused \r\n  a directed verdict.  State v. Pinckney, supra (if the State presents \r\n  any evidence which reasonably tends to prove defendant's guilt, or from which \r\n  defendant's guilt could be fairly and logically deduced, case must go to the \r\n  jury).   \r\nc. Viability\r\nFinally, McKnight asserts she was entitled to a \r\n  directed verdict as there was no evidence the baby was viable at the time she \r\n  ingested cocaine.  This argument was not raised in McKnightâ€™s motions to dismiss.  \r\n  Nor was it ruled on by the trial court.  Accordingly, this argument is unpreserved.  \r\n  State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209, cert. denied, 525 \r\n  U.S. 1022 (1998) (issue must be raised to and ruled upon by trial court to be \r\n  preserved for review).     \r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDIMISSAL OF HOMICIDE  INDICTMENT\r\nMcKnight next asserts the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to dismiss the homicide by child abuse indictment on the grounds that a) the \r\n  more specific criminal abortion statute governs, b) the homicide  by child abuse \r\n  statute does not apply to the facts of this case, and c) the legislature did \r\n  not intend the statute to apply to fetuses.  We disagree. \r\n a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criminal Abortion Statute  \r\nInitially, McKnight asserts the criminal abortion statute, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-41-80, is a more specific statute which controls under the \r\n  circumstances of this case.  McKnight did not raise this contention to the trial \r\n  court.  Contrary to the assertions in her reply brief, although McKnight did \r\n  argue that the statute was inapplicable to the circumstances of this case, at \r\n  no time did she assert that the criminal abortion statute was the more specific, \r\n  controlling statute.  Accordingly, this issue is unpreserved.  State v. Hicks, \r\n  supra (issue must be raised to and ruled upon by trial court to be preserved \r\n  for review).     \r\n b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application of Homicide  by Abuse Statute \r\n  in This Case  \r\nMcKnight next asserts the Legislature did not intend the \r\n  homicide by child abuse statute apply to the stillbirth of a fetus.  We disagree.\r\nMcKnight asserts the term â€œchild,â€ as used in \r\n  the statute, is most naturally read as including only children already born.  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(B).  In several cases this Court has specifically \r\n  held that the Legislatureâ€™s use of the term â€œchildâ€ includes a viable fetus.  \r\n  State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998); Whitner v. State, \r\n  328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997); State v. Horne, 282 S.C. 444, 319 \r\n  S.E.2d 703 (1984).  McKnight cites to portions of the statute defining â€œharmâ€ \r\n  as relating to corporal punishment and/or abandonment; she asserts this demonstrates \r\n  that the statute was clearly intended to apply only to children already born.  \r\n  However, section 16-3-85 (B) also defines â€œharmâ€ as â€œinflicting or allowing \r\n  to be inflicted on the child physical injury. . .â€ and â€œfailing to supply the \r\n  child with adequate health care. . .â€  Either of these provisions may clearly \r\n  be applied to an unborn child.  Accordingly, given the language of the statute, \r\n  and this Courtâ€™s prior opinions defining a child to include a viable fetus, \r\n  we find the plain language of the statute does not preclude its application \r\n  to the present case.\r\n c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legislative History  \r\nMcKnight lastly asserts that the legislative history of \r\n  section 16-3-85 conclusively demonstrates that it does not apply to unborn children.  \r\n  We find this contention unpersuasive.  \r\nSection 16-3-85 was amended by 2000 Acts No. 261, Â§ 1.  \r\n  The prior statute read that a person is guilty of homicide  by child abuse who \r\n  â€œcauses the death of a child under the age of eleven while committing child \r\n  abuse or neglect as defined in Section 20-7-490, [4]  and the death occurs under circumstances manifesting \r\n  an extreme indifference to human life.â€  (Emphasis supplied).  The effect of \r\n  the 2000 amendment was the deletion of the reference to the definitions of â€œabuseâ€ \r\n  and â€œneglectâ€ contained in section 20-7-490, and the addition of subsection \r\n  (B), defining those terms as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) &quot;child abuse or neglect&quot; means an act or omission \r\n  by any person which causes harm to the child's physical health or welfare;\r\n(2) &quot;harm&quot; to a child's health or welfare occurs \r\n  when a person:\r\n          (a) inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the \r\n  child physical injury, including injuries sustained as a result of excessive \r\n  corporal punishment;\r\n          (b) fails to supply the child with adequate food, \r\n  clothing, shelter, or health care, and the failure to do so causes a physical \r\n  injury or condition resulting in death;  or\r\n          (c) abandons the child resulting in the child's \r\n  death.\r\n\r\nThere is a presumption that the legislature has knowledge \r\n  of previous legislation as well as of judicial decisions construing that legislation \r\n  when later statutes are enacted concerning related subjects.  State v. Corey \r\n  D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 23 (2000); Berkebeile v. Outen, 311 \r\n  S.C. 50, 426 S.E.2d 760 (1993).  The homicide  by child abuse statute was amended \r\n  in May 2000, some three years after this Court, in Whitner, had specifically \r\n  held that the term â€œchildâ€ includes a viable fetus. \r\n  [5]   The fact that the legislature was well aware of this Courtâ€™s opinion \r\n  in Whitner, yet failed to omit â€œviable fetusâ€ from the statuteâ€™s applicability, \r\n  is persuasive evidence that the legislature did not intend to exempt fetuses \r\n  from the statuteâ€™s operation.  Contrary to McKnightâ€™s assertion, we do not find \r\n  the legislatureâ€™s decision to define the terms â€œabuse and neglectâ€ within the \r\n  confines of section 16-3-85, deleting the reference to section 20-7-490 of the \r\n  Childrenâ€™s Code, in any way evinces a retraction from our opinion in Whitner.  \r\n  Although Whitner did examine the policy and purpose of the Childrenâ€™s \r\n  Code, that discussion was not central to our  holding.  More fundamentally, \r\n  Whitner found no basis upon which to grant a viable fetus the status \r\n  of a â€œpersonâ€ for purposes of homicide  and wrongful death laws, while denying \r\n  such status in the context of child abuse.  Indeed, if the legislature had intended \r\n  to remove a fetus from the operation of the statute, it could have plainly said \r\n  so.  Stardancer Casino v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 556 S.E.2d 357 (2001); \r\n  Tilley v. Pacesetter, 333 S.C. 33, 508 S.E.2d 16 (1998) (if legislature \r\n  had intended certain result in statute it would have said so).  \r\n 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DUE PROCESS/NOTICE  \r\nMcKnight next asserts application of the homicide  by child \r\n  abuse statute to her violates due process; she contends she had no notice the \r\n  statute could be applied to a woman whose fetus is stillborn.  We disagree.\r\nIn numerous cases dating since 1960, we have held that a \r\n  viable fetus is a â€œperson.â€  Hall v. Murphy, 236 S.C. 257, 113 S.E.2d \r\n  790 (1960); Fowler v. Woodward, 244 S.C. 608, 138 S.E.2d 42 (1964); State \r\n  v. Horne, 282 S.C. 444, 319 S.E.2d 703 (1984).  In Whitner, supra, \r\n  we reiterated the fact that a viable fetus is a â€œchildâ€ within the meaning of \r\n  the child abuse and endangerment statute.  Most recently, we held that a viable \r\n  fetus is both &quot;person&quot; and &quot;child&quot; as used in statutory \r\n  aggravating circumstances which provide for death penalty eligibility.   State \r\n  v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998).  \r\nA penal statute offends due process only when it fails to \r\n  give fair notice of the conduct it proscribes.  State v. Edwards, 302 \r\n  S.C. 492, 397 S.E.2d 88 (1990); State v. Smith, 275 S.C. 164, 268 S.E.2d \r\n  276 (1980).  The statute must give sufficient notice to enable a reasonable \r\n  person to comprehend what is prohibited.  State v. Crenshaw, 274 S.C. \r\n  475, 266 S.E.2d 61, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 883 (1980).  In Whitner, \r\n  we rejected the claim that application of the child endangerment and neglect \r\n  statute did not give the defendant fair notice of the conduct proscribed, stating:\r\n\r\nThe statute forbids any person having legal custody of a \r\n  child from refusing or neglecting to provide proper care and attention to the \r\n  child so that the life, health, or comfort of the child is endangered or is \r\n  likely to be endangered.  As we have found above, the plain meaning of &quot;child&quot; \r\n  as used in this statute includes a viable fetus.  Furthermore, it is common \r\n  knowledge that use of cocaine during pregnancy can harm the viable unborn child.  \r\n  Given these facts, we do not see how Whitner can claim she lacked fair notice \r\n  that her behavior constituted child endangerment as proscribed in section 20-7-50.  \r\n  Whitner had all the notice the Constitution requires.\r\n\r\n328 S.C. at 16, 492 S.E.2d at 784-785.  \r\nSimilarly, a person is guilty of homicide  by \r\n  child abuse if the person causes the death of a child under the age of eleven \r\n  while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death occurs under circumstances \r\n  manifesting an extreme indifference to human life.  Under Whitner, taking \r\n  cocaine while pregnant constitutes neglect and, as discussed in Issue 1 above, \r\n  it was a jury question whether McKnight acted with â€œextreme indifference to \r\n  human life.â€  Given the ample authority in this state finding a viable fetus \r\n  to be a person, we find McKnight was on notice that her conduct in ingesting \r\n  cocaine would be proscribed. [6] \r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RIGHT TO PRIVACY\r\nMcKnight next asserts application of the homicide  by child \r\n  abuse statute to women for conduct during pregnancy violates the constitutional \r\n  rights of privacy and autonomy.\r\nMcKnight asserts several policy reasons why women should \r\n  not be placed in the position of fearing prosecution for conduct engaged in \r\n  while pregnant (e.g., choosing abortion over pregnancy, foregoing medical care, \r\n  etc.).  While she raises a number of legitimate concerns, she is in reality \r\n  attempting to assert the privacy rights of other pregnant women, something she \r\n  does not have standing to do.  Curtis v. State, supra (one cannot \r\n  obtain a decision as to the invalidity of an act on the ground that it impairs \r\n  the rights of others).  \r\nAs to her own right to privacy, this Court specifically \r\n  rejected the claim that prosecution for abuse and neglect of a viable fetus \r\n  due to the motherâ€™s ingestion of cocaine violates any fundamental right.  Whitner, \r\n  supra.  In Whitner we stated, \r\n\r\nIt strains belief for Whitner to argue that using crack \r\n  cocaine during pregnancy is encompassed within the constitutionally recognized \r\n  right of privacy.  Use of crack cocaine is illegal, period.  No one here argues \r\n  that laws criminalizing the use of crack cocaine are themselves unconstitutional.  \r\n  If the State wishes to impose additional criminal penalties on pregnant women \r\n  who engage in this already illegal conduct because of the effect the conduct \r\n  has on the viable fetus, it may do so.  We do not see how the fact of pregnancy \r\n  elevates the use of crack cocaine to the lofty status of a fundamental right.\r\n\r\n328 S.C. at 18, 492 S.E.2d at 786.  Accordingly, we find \r\n  McKnightâ€™s right of privacy was not violated.\r\n  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIGHTH AMENDMENT\r\nMcKnight next asserts the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to dismiss the indictment on Eighth Amendment grounds.  We disagree.\r\nThe cruel and unusual punishment clause requires the \r\n  duration of a sentence not be grossly out of proportion with the severity of \r\n  the crime.  Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983).  Pursuant to Solem, \r\n  this Court reviews three factors in assessing proportionality: (1) the gravity \r\n  of the offense compared to the harshness of the penalty; (2) sentences imposed \r\n  on other criminals in the same jurisdiction;  and (3) sentences for the same \r\n  crime in other jurisdictions.  State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  541 (2001). [7]   \r\nHere, the gravity of the offense is severe; McKnight \r\n  is charged with homicide. [8]   The sentence for homicide  by child abuse \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(C)(1) is twenty years to life, and McKnight received \r\n  a twenty year sentence, suspended upon service of twelve years.  The penalty \r\n  is no harsher than that imposed upon any other individual charged with murder.  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (persons guilty of murder must be punished \r\n  by death, life imprisonment, or mandatory minimum term of thirty years); Simmons \r\n  v. State, 264 S.C. 417, 215 S.E.2d 883 (1975) (holding sentence of life \r\n  imprisonment resulting from a wrongful killing caused by the use of an automobile \r\n  is not cruel and unusual punishment).\r\nFinally, although other states have not defined \r\n  a viable fetus as a child for purposes of criminal prosecution of a pregnant mother, other states \r\n  impose severe sentences on those who are guilty of the murder or neglect of \r\n  a child.  See e.g., Az. St. Â§ 13-604.1 (B)(person convicted of \r\n  attempted murder of a minor under twelve years of age may be sentenced to life \r\n  imprisonment); Or. St. Ann. Â§ 163.115 (1)(c)(when a person by abuse, recklessly \r\n  under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, \r\n  causes the death of a child under 14 years of age, it is murder requiring mandatory \r\n  life sentence); W.Va. Code Â§ 61-8D-2 (parent who maliciously and intentionally \r\n  fails to supply child with necessary food, clothing, shelter or medical care \r\n  resulting in childâ€™s death is guilty of murder in first degree and penalized \r\n  accordingly).  We find no Eighth Amendment violation.\r\n  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EQUAL PROTECTION\r\nMcKnight next asserts that application of the homicide by \r\n  child abuse statute to her violates equal protection inasmuch as a person charged \r\n  under the criminal abortion statute is subjected to a maximum of two years imprisonment, \r\n  while one prosecuted under the homicide  by child abuse statute is subjected \r\n  to the possibility of life imprisonment. \r\nThis issue is procedurally barred from review.  While McKnight \r\n  did file a pre-trial motion to dismiss based upon equal protection, and renewed \r\n  that motion at trial, her arguments at trial were premised upon the statuteâ€™s \r\n  applicability only to women and its disparate impact upon women.  At no time \r\n  did she raise the contention she now raises concerning the disproportionality \r\n  of the criminal abortion statute.  Accordingly, this argument is unpreserved \r\n  and we therefore decline to address it.  State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 268 (2000) (party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate \r\n  ground on appeal); In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001) \r\n  (constitutional claim must be raised and ruled upon to be preserved for appellate \r\n  review).\r\n  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUPRESSION OF URINE SAMPLE\r\nFinally, McKnight asserts the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to suppress the results of a urine sample taken at the hospital after the stillbirth, \r\n  contending the sample was taken in violation of her fourth amendment rights.  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nPursuant to a Conway Hospital Protocol for the Management \r\n  of Drug Abuse during Pregnancy, a medical urine drug screening may be \r\n  ordered at the discretion of the attending physician if an obstetrical patient \r\n  meets one of several criteria, including lack of prenatal care or unexplained \r\n  fetal demise.  If such a drug screening test turns up positive from the hospitalâ€™s \r\n  lab, then hospital personnel are to request consent from the patient for forensic \r\n  (medical-legal) testing.  If consent is obtained, the sample is sent to the \r\n  hospitalâ€™s reference lab and the nursery is notified.  The Department of Social \r\n  Services is to be notified of positive medical urine drug screening and the \r\n  criteria causing the drug screen to be done, and whether forensic testing is \r\n  being done on the mother or newborn.  The protocol states that â€œAs mandated \r\n  by law, it is the obligation of every medical facility, as well as each individual, \r\n  to report to DSS any suspected abuse or neglect involving an unborn, yet viable, \r\n  fetus or newborn child.â€  The hospital also has a Chain of Custody form and \r\n  procedure for handling forensic samples.   \r\nHere, an initial drug screen was ordered by the obstetrician, \r\n  Dr. Niles, due to McKnightâ€™s lack of prenatal care.  When the initial screen \r\n  tested positive for cocaine, Mary McBride, a labor and delivery nurse, was instructed \r\n  to obtain a forensic urine sample from McKnight.  Before doing so, McBride read \r\n  an â€œInformed Consent to Drug Testingâ€ form to McKnight.  McBride testified she \r\n  read the form to McKnight, and advised her that it could be used for legal purposes; \r\n  she did not, however, specifically advise McKnight that police would possibly \r\n  arrest her.  The form states that McKnight acknowledges she has testified positive \r\n  for cocaine, and is being requested to give consent for a â€œmedical-legal (forensic) \r\n  test which will confirm or deny the initial report.  The form further states \r\n  that â€œIt has been explained to me that I may refuse consent for this test.  \r\n  It has been explained to me that this test may be used for legal purposes.â€  \r\n  McKnight signed the form indicating her consent.  The second sample also tested \r\n  positive for cocaine. \r\nMcKnight asserts the forensic/legal sample was \r\n  taken in violation of her fourth amendment rights, contrary to the United States \r\n  Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 \r\n  (2001).  We disagree.  The issue in Ferguson, as framed by the Court, \r\n  was as follows: \r\n\r\nIn this case, we must decide whether a state hospital's \r\n  performance of a diagnostic test to obtain evidence of a patient's criminal \r\n  conduct for law enforcement purposes is an unreasonable search if the patient \r\n  has not consented to the procedure. More narrowly, the question is whether the \r\n  interest in using the threat of criminal sanctions to deter pregnant women from \r\n  using cocaine can justify a departure from the general rule that an official \r\n  nonconsensual search is unconstitutional if not authorized by a valid warrant.  \r\n\r\n\r\n532 U.S. at 69-70.\r\nIn Ferguson, staff members of MUSC developed \r\n  a written policy, in conjunction with the solicitor and police, for obtaining \r\n  evidence to prosecute women who bore children who tested positive for drugs \r\n  at birth. These procedures provided a plan to identify and test pregnant patients \r\n  suspected of drug use without their knowledge or consent. The plan (1) \r\n  required that a chain of custody be followed when obtaining and testing patients' \r\n  urine samples, (2) contained police procedures and criteria for arresting patients \r\n  who tested positive, and (3) encouraged prosecution for drug offenses and child \r\n  neglect, and specifically set forth the offenses with which the women could \r\n  be charged, as well as procedures for police to follow upon arresting the women.  \r\n  Id. at 70-73.\r\nThe Supreme Court held MUSCâ€™s performance of diagnostic \r\n  tests to obtain evidence of the womenâ€™s criminal conduct for law enforcement \r\n  purposes was an unreasonable search if the patient had not consented to the \r\n  procedure.  Id. at 84-85.  The Court held that â€œ[g]iven the primary purpose \r\n  of the Charleston program, which was to use the threat of arrest and prosecution \r\n  in order to force women into treatment, and given the extensive involvement \r\n  of law enforcement officials at every stage,â€ the policy did not fit with the \r\n  closely guarded â€œspecial needsâ€ category which would justify a warrantless, \r\n  non-consensual search.  Id. \r\nFerguson  is distinguishable in several respects.  \r\n  First, there is no evidence that Conway Hospitalâ€™s policy was in any way developed \r\n  or implemented in conjunction with police, the solicitor, the Attorney General, \r\n  or any other law enforcement personnel.  Second, unlike the policy at issue \r\n  in Ferguson, Conway Hospitalâ€™s policy did not require hospital staff \r\n  to turn drug screening results over to law enforcement personnel.  On the contrary, \r\n  the hospitalâ€™s protocol merely requires that its department of social work services \r\n  be notified and that a telephone referral be made to DSS when an assessment \r\n  reveals suspicion of illegal drug use or reason to believe the unborn or newborn \r\n  child is at risk.  A DSS caseworker is not a law enforcement officer.  State \r\n  v. Sprouse, 325 S.C. 275, 478 S.E.2d 871 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nThird, unlike Ferguson, Conway Hospitalâ€™s testing \r\n  was not done surreptitiously, but was done with McKnightâ€™s knowledge and consent.  \r\n  The labor and delivery nurse specifically testified that she obtained a written \r\n  consent form from McKnight to perform the second urine specimen; the consent \r\n  form indicated to McKnight that she had the right to refuse the test, and that \r\n  it could be used for legal purposes.  \r\nWe find the state sufficiently demonstrated, through the \r\n  testimony of Nurse McBride, that McKnight consented to the search.  The only \r\n  evidence in the record on this point is the testimony of McBride, who testified \r\n  that she read the form to McKnight, and told her that the sample could be used \r\n  for legal purposes.  The form which was read to McKnight specifically advised \r\n  that she may refuse consent, and that the test may be used for legal purposes.  \r\n  This is sufficient evidence upon which to find the consent was voluntary.  Schneckloth \r\n  v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973); State v. Wallace, 269 S.C. 547, \r\n  238 S.E.2d 675 (1977) (whether a consent to search was voluntary is a question \r\n  of fact to be determined from the &quot;totality of the circumstances).&quot;  \r\n\r\nFinally, even assuming arguendo that McKnight \r\n  did not consent to the urine specimen, and that it was illegally obtained, we \r\n  find any error in its admission was harmless.  The DSS caseworker testified, \r\n  without objection, that McKnight told her she knew she was pregnant and that \r\n  she had been using crack cocaine when she could get it.  Further, the defensesâ€™ \r\n  own expert, Dr. Conradi, testified that cocaine was in the baby at some point.  \r\n  Both of the stateâ€™s expert pathologists testified that the only way for the \r\n  infant to have the benzoylecgonine present was through cocaine, and that the \r\n  cocaine had to have come from the mother.  Given this evidence, even assuming \r\n  the urine sample was erroneously admitted, it could not have impacted the juryâ€™s \r\n  verdict.  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992), cert. \r\n  denied, 507 U.S. 927 (1993) (error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt \r\n  where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained).\r\nMcKnightâ€™s conviction and sentence are affirmed.\r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n TOAL, C.J., and BURNETT, J., concur.  MOORE, \r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  I respectfully dissent.  Once again, I must \r\n  part company with the majority for condoning the prosecution of a pregnant woman \r\n  under a statute that could not have been intended for such a purpose.  Our abortion \r\n  statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-41-80(b) (2002), carries a maximum punishment of \r\n  two years or a $1,000 fine for the intentional killing of a viable fetus by \r\n  its mother.  In penalizing this conduct, the legislature recognized the unique \r\n  situation of a feticide by the mother.  I do not believe the legislature intended \r\n  to allow the prosecution of a pregnant woman for homicide by child abuse under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (Supp. 2001) which provides a disproportionately \r\n  greater punishment of twenty years to life.\r\nAs expressed in my dissent in Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d \r\n  777 (1997), [9]  it is for the legislature to determine whether \r\n  to penalize a pregnant womanâ€™s abuse of her own body because of the potential \r\n  harm to her fetus.  It is not the business of this Court to expand the application \r\n  of a criminal statute to conduct not clearly within its ambit.  To the contrary, \r\n  we are constrained to strictly construe penal statutes in the defendantâ€™s favor.  \r\n  State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 (1991).    \r\nBecause I disagree that Â§ 16-3-85 applies in this case, I dissent. \r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]    He testified that because of the rapid breakdown of pure cocaine, \r\n    a baby would always have benzoylecgonine in its system, rather than pure cocaine.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]    He testified that chorioamnionitis and funisitis is the medical \r\n    term given to the placenta and umbilical cord when they are inflamed, which \r\n    can be caused by an underlying infection, but that most children with these \r\n    conditions have live births.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3]    McKnight was also indicted for distribution of cocaine.  The court \r\n    dismissed the distribution charge.  A separate appeal from that ruling remains \r\n    pending in this Court.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [4]   Section 20-7-490 is contained in the Childrenâ€™s Code and defines \r\n    â€œchildâ€ as a â€œperson under the age of eighteenâ€ and also defines â€œabused or \r\n    neglected child,â€ and â€œharm.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [5]\r\n     \r\n    We granted McKnightâ€™s motion to argue against the precedent of Whitner \r\n    v. State, supra.  We adhere to our opinion in Whitner.   \r\n    As did Whitner, McKnight forebodes a â€œparade of horriblesâ€ and points to commentators \r\n    who object to the prosecution of pregnant women as being contrary to public \r\n    policy and deterring women from seeking appropriate medical care and/or creating \r\n    incentives for women to seek abortions to avoid prosecution.  See e.g. \r\n    Tolliver, Child Abuse Statute Expanded to Protect the Viable Fetus: The \r\n    Abusive Effects of South Carolinaâ€™s Interpretation of the Word â€œChildâ€, \r\n    24 S.Ill.U.L.J. 383 (Winter 2000); DeLouth, Pregnant Drug Addicts As Child \r\n    Abusers: A South Carolina Ruling, 14 Berkeley Womenâ€™s L.J. 96 (1999).  \r\n  \r\n  However, not all of the commentaries concerning Whitner \r\n    have been critical.  See Miller, Fetal Neglect and State Intervention: \r\n    Preventing Another Attleboro Cult Baby Death, 8 Cardozo Womenâ€™s L. J. \r\n    71 (2001)(suggesting that the state's interest in protecting the life of the \r\n    fetus takes precedence over any rights the mother may have and that the fetus \r\n    has the right to be protected by the State as soon as the fetus is viable \r\n    or when a woman can no longer obtain a legal abortion); Janssen, Fetal \r\n    Rights and the Prosecution of Women For Using Drugs During Pregnancy, \r\n    48 Drake L.Rev. 741 (2000); Schueller, The Use of Cocaine by Pregnant Women: \r\n    Child Abuse or Choice? 25 J. Legisl. 163 (1999).  As noted by Janssen, \r\n    although the threat of abortion or lack of prenatal care is real, â€œthe burden \r\n    placed on pregnant substance abusers is not the burden to get an abortion.  \r\n    Rather the burden is on the woman to stop using illegal drugs once she has \r\n    exercised her constitutional decision not to have an abortion. . . . Once \r\n    the mother has made the choice to have a child, she must accept the consequences \r\n    of that choice.  One of the consequences of having children is that it creates \r\n    certain duties and obligations to that child.  If a woman does not fulfill \r\n    those obligations, then the state must step in to prevent harm to the child.  \r\n    As one judge aptly pointed out, there is simply â€˜no reason to treat a child \r\n    in utero any differently from a child ex utero where the mother has decided \r\n    not to destroy the fetus or where the time allowed for such destruction is \r\n    past.â€™â€  48 Drake L. Rev. at 762-763 (Internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\n \r\n    [6]\r\n    McKnight \r\n    also asserts the statute as interpreted to apply to pregnant women is void \r\n    for vagueness as it is unclear what conduct by a pregnant woman is likely \r\n    to result in the stillbirth of her fetus.  As recently recognized by the Court \r\n    in Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001), however, one \r\n    to whose conduct the law clearly applies does not have standing to challenge \r\n    it for vagueness.  Given that the statute clearly applies to a stillbirth \r\n    caused by ingestion of cocaine, McKnight lacks standing to raise a void for \r\n    vagueness contention.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [7]    It is questionable, in light of the United States Supreme Court's \r\n    opinion in Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), whether the stringent \r\n    three-factor Solem inquiry remains mandated in &quot;cruel and unusual \r\n    punishment&quot; cases.  See State v. Brannon, 341 S.C. 271, \r\n    533 S.E.2d 345 (Ct.App.2000) (finding 3-prong inquiry no longer applicable \r\n    and requiring only a threshold comparison of the gravity of the offenses against \r\n    the severity of the sentence). \r\n\r\n \r\n    [8]    To the extent McKnight attempts to compare the \r\n    gravity of the offense with criminal abortion, she is, in reality, raising \r\n    an equal protection claim.   See Issue 6 below.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [9]\r\n    \r\n   \r\n     See also State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998) \r\n    (Moore, J. dissenting). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25586","title":"Bakala v.

Varner, of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n  for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ACTING JUSTICE FLOYD:  In this domestic case, appellant \r\n  (Husband) appeals three family court orders regarding contempt, equitable division, \r\n  and divorce on the ground of adultery.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband was born in the Czech Republic, which was formerly part of \r\n  Czechoslovakia, and came to this country as a political refugee.  He holds dual \r\n  U.S. and Czech citizenship.  Husband and respondent (Wife) met while both were \r\n  business graduate students at Dartmouth College.  They married after graduation \r\n  in 1990 while living in New York City. \r\nAfter marrying, the parties moved to London and then Prague where \r\n  they both worked.  Wife quit working sometime before the birth of their son \r\n  in 1994.  When Czechoslovakia was divided in the early 1990â€™s, Husband co-founded \r\n  the first full-service investment bank in the Czech Republic, Patria Finance, \r\n  and was very successful.  He also invested in several restaurants through his \r\n  investment company, Hartig Company.  According to Wife, during this time, the \r\n  parties â€œtraveled a lot and lived very, very well.â€  They renovated a four-story \r\n  house in one of Pragueâ€™s most fashionable neighborhoods.  Husbandâ€™s average \r\n  yearly income was $536,817.  \r\nIn November 1996, Wife confronted Husband with information that he \r\n  was having an affair.  After a physical altercation, Wife left the marital residence.  \r\n  Two weeks later, she and Husband divided their  savings account and, with $198,000, \r\n  Wife moved back to the U.S. where she eventually settled in Beaufort County.\r\nOn May 1, 1998, while Husband was visiting from Prague, Wife had \r\n  him personally served with a summons and complaint seeking a divorce on the \r\n  ground of adultery or physical cruelty, custody of the partiesâ€™ minor son, child \r\n  support, alimony, and equitable division of the marital estate.\r\nOn May 7, Wife filed a motion for temporary relief.  \r\n  A hearing was held June 3, 1998, at which both parties and their attorneys appeared.  \r\n  Husband agreed to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the Beaufort County \r\n  Family Court on all issues.  Following this hearing, as part of its temporary \r\n  order, the family court ordered Husband to deposit in escrow $500,000 upon the \r\n  pending sale of shares of Patria Finance in which he acknowledged owning a 34.5% \r\n  interest.  An additional $250,000 was to be deposited pro rata over the next \r\n  eighteen months resulting in a payment schedule requiring equal payments of \r\n  $83,333 each in December 1998, June 1999, and December 1999.\r\nHusband answered and counterclaimed on the merits of \r\n  Wifeâ€™s action.  He alleged that on the day of the temporary hearing, he had \r\n  learned that Wife was engaged in an adulterous relationship and accordingly \r\n  he was entitled to a divorce on the ground of her adultery.  In Wifeâ€™s reply, \r\n  she admitted she was currently engaged in a relationship that began in June \r\n  1997 after the parties had separated.  Wife subsequently withdrew her request \r\n  for alimony. \r\nMeanwhile, Husband returned to Prague while the litigation \r\n  continued.  On June 3, 1999, a pre-trial conference was held at which Husbandâ€™s \r\n  counsel appeared.  A trial date was set for November 1, 1999.  Effective August \r\n  13, 1999, counsel was relieved at Husbandâ€™s request and Husband was ordered \r\n  to appoint an agent for service or he would be served by mail in the Czech Republic.  \r\n\r\nThe final hearing in the case was held as scheduled \r\n  on November 1, 1999.  Husband did not appear.  By order dated December 21, 1999, \r\n  the family court found Husband in contempt of the 1998 temporary order, ordered \r\n  child support, equitably divided the marital estate 50/50, and awarded attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs.  By order dated December 22, 1999, Wife was granted a divorce \r\n  on the ground of adultery.  These appeals followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the family courtâ€™s order dividing the marital \r\n  estate reversible because of an ex parte communication?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were Husbandâ€™s due process rights violated?\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did service in Prague violate international law?\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the valuation of the marital estate proper?\r\n  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family court retain jurisdiction \r\n  to determine the validity of the bench warrant?\r\n  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the deposit of funds with \r\n  the court purge Husband of contempt?\r\n  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the award of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  excessive?\r\n  8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the family court have \r\n  sua sponte dismissed Wifeâ€™s complaint on the ground of recrimination?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.  Ex parte communication\r\nHusband complains the family court relied on an ex \r\n  parte communication in valuing the marital estate.  He claims he was unfairly \r\n  prejudiced because the evidence does not otherwise support the family courtâ€™s \r\n  findings.\r\nAs found in the 1998 temporary order, at the time of filing Husband \r\n  held a 34.5% interest in Patria Finance, the investment bank he co-founded in \r\n  Prague, and had pending contracts to sell some of his shares.  As required by \r\n  the temporary order, Husband made an initial escrow deposit of $500,000 and \r\n  made a second deposit of $83,333 in December 1998.  He did not make the June \r\n  1999 payment.  At the time of the final hearing on November 1, 1999, Husband \r\n  owed two payments of $83,333 each, for a total of $166,666. \r\nThe record indicates Husband received a total of  $3,049,475 for \r\n  the sale of a 14.5% interest in Patria; he retained a 20% interest valued at \r\n  $3,000,000.  The total value of the Patria stock in the marital estate is therefore \r\n  $6,049,475.  \r\nAfter the final hearing on November 1, 1999, the family court faxed \r\n  to Wifeâ€™s counsel a hand-written list dividing the marital assets   and requested \r\n  counsel to call the judge.  There is no evidence Husband was informed of this \r\n  fax. \r\nIn response to the family courtâ€™s fax, Wifeâ€™s counsel \r\n  forwarded a letter from her financial expert explaining that the court had omitted \r\n  $2,265,809 from the marital estate.  The explanation notes that in dividing \r\n  the Patria stock, the family court considered only the escrow amounts previously \r\n  ordered to be paid to Wife under the temporary order and the value of the 20% \r\n  interest still held by Husband.  This division did not take into account the \r\n  evidence that Husband actually received a total of $3,049,475 from the sale \r\n  of the Patria stock, or $2,265,809 more than the amount considered.  The record \r\n  indicates a copy of this letter was faxed to Husband. \r\nThe family courtâ€™s final order conforms to the calculation \r\n  faxed by Wifeâ€™s counsel to the family court.  The family court ordered Husband \r\n  to transfer to Wife 10,909 shares from his remaining 20% interest in Patria \r\n  or pay her $1,636,404, to complete Wifeâ€™s 50% share of the total Patria asset.\r\nHusband contends the only support for the family courtâ€™s final order is the \r\n  calculation by Wifeâ€™s expert faxed to the family court after the final hearing.  \r\n  He contends this letter was an improper ex parte communication that prejudiced \r\n  him.  He asserts by affidavit that he had no knowledge of the communication \r\n  between Wifeâ€™s counsel and the family court until this appeal was filed. [1] \r\nGenerally, one who has notice and fails to appear cannot complain of an ex \r\n  parte proceeding.  See People v. Klovstad, 522 N.E.2d 803 (Ill. \r\n  App. 1988); Repp v. Horton, 335 N.E.2d 722 (Ohio 1974).  Here, Husband \r\n  had notice [2]  and intentionally \r\n  absented himself from the entire evidentiary hearing.  The communication between \r\n  the family court and Wifeâ€™s counsel introduced no new evidence and was simply \r\n  a continued discussion of the same matter.  Since the entire final hearing was \r\n  ex parte because of Husbandâ€™s intentional absence, Husband waived any objection \r\n  to this post-hearing communication.\r\nFurther, although ex parte contacts are strongly disfavored, prejudice must \r\n  be shown to obtain a reversal on this ground.  Ellis v. Proctor and Gamble \r\n  Distrib. Co., 315 S.C. 283, 433 S.E.2d 856 (1993); Burgess v. Stern, \r\n  311 S.C. 326, 428 S.E.2d 880 (1993).  Husband has shown no prejudice.\r\nAs evidence of prejudice, Husband points to the family \r\n  courtâ€™s finding of a total marital estate of $8,384,809, which is greater than \r\n  the $7,562,846 amount submitted by Wife as exhibit 36 at trial.  This difference \r\n  in the total marital estate, however, is not due to the recalculation of the \r\n  Patria stock which was the subject of the ex parte communication.\r\nThe family court valued the marital residence at $1.5 million based on Wifeâ€™s \r\n  testimony and her request for admissions which Husband was deemed to admit by \r\n  his failure to respond, rather than the $1 million valuation in exhibit 36.  \r\n  Further, the family court included in its calculation of the marital estate \r\n  a credit of $198,000 to each party for the savings account they divided when \r\n  they first separated.  This credit was not calculated in Wifeâ€™s exhibit 36 which \r\n  accounts for only $74,037 from the partiesâ€™ savings account.  These differences \r\n  in the valuation of the marital home and the savings account explain the difference \r\n  between exhibit 36 and the order in the total marital estate.\r\nIn the family courtâ€™s final order, neither the valuation of the house nor the \r\n  $198,000 credit to each party is changed from the judgeâ€™s hand-written note \r\n  which issued before the ex parte communication  from Wifeâ€™s counsel.  \r\n  Further, these amounts are supported by the record.  The division of the Patria \r\n  stock, the only asset recalculated based on Wifeâ€™s expertâ€™s letter, is also \r\n  supported by the record.  Accordingly, Husband cannot show prejudice from the \r\n  ex parte communication between the family court and Wifeâ€™s counsel.\r\nIn conclusion,  we find Husband waived his objection \r\n  to the ex parte communication between the judge and Wifeâ€™s counsel and, further, \r\n  that he has failed to show prejudice.\r\n2.  Due process\r\nHusband claims his procedural due process rights were violated by Wifeâ€™s mailing \r\n  of various notices [3]  pursuant \r\n  to the family courtâ€™s order allowing Husband to be served by mail in Prague.  \r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1999, the family court signed an order granting Husbandâ€™s \r\n  counsel permission to withdraw from the case at Husbandâ€™s request, and ordering \r\n  Husband to appoint an agent for service in the U.S. â€œwithin two weeks, or, on \r\n  or before August 13, 1999.â€  Failure to appoint an agent as directed would render \r\n  service on Husband effective as of the date of mailing to the Czech Republic \r\n  for all documents subsequently served.  See Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP (service \r\n  by mail complete upon mailing).  This order was filed August 19.  \r\nHusband complains service by mail violated his procedural due process \r\n  rights because he did not have timely notice of the order that he appoint an \r\n  agent for service.  As indicated in the record, mail to the Czech Republic takes \r\n  ten to fourteen days.  Further, the date for appointment of an agent (August \r\n  13) was before the order itself was filed (August 19).\r\nWe find Husband waived any objection to the family courtâ€™s August 19 order \r\n  allowing service by mail.  Although, as Husband correctly points out, it would \r\n  have been impossible for him to comply with the directive that he appoint an \r\n  agent for service by August 13, there is no indication Husband ever attempted \r\n  to appoint such an agent.  Husband did not appeal the August 19 order, nor does \r\n  he claim the directive to appoint an agent violated his due process rights.  \r\n  Husband never raised any due process issue to the family court, an issue which \r\n  could have been raised by a Rule 59(e) motion.  A due process claim raised for \r\n  the first time on appeal is not preserved.  Grant v. South Carolina Coastal \r\n  Council, 319 S.C. 348, 461 S.E.2d 388 (1995).  \r\nFurther, the record indicates Wifeâ€™s counsel both faxed and mailed to Husband \r\n  every document served subsequent to the August 19 order.  Evidence of mailing \r\n  establishes a rebuttable presumption of receipt.  Weir v. Citicorp Natâ€™l \r\n  Servs. Inc., 312 S.C. 511, 435 S.E.2d 864 (1993).  Here, there is no evidence \r\n  rebutting this presumption to indicate Husband was deprived of actual notice \r\n  by Wifeâ€™s mailing of these various documents.\r\nFinally, there is no evidence Husband was prejudiced by the evidence procured \r\n  as a result of the discovery notices mailed to him in Prague.  The evidence \r\n  obtained was merely cumulative to other evidence or was not prejudicial in light \r\n  of the 50/50 division of marital assets. \r\n  [4]   We conclude Husband has failed to show prejudice and we find no merit \r\n  in his due process claim.  Ross v. Med. Univ. of South Carolina, 328 \r\n  S.C. 51, 492 S.E.2d 62 (1993) (one claiming a deprivation of procedural due \r\n  process must show substantial prejudice).  \r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International law\r\nHusband contends that service abroad of the various \r\n  notices mailed after August 19 and service of the Rule to Show Cause underlying \r\n  the contempt finding violated international law.\r\na.  Notices\r\nHusband claims service of the various notices by mail \r\n  to Prague pursuant to the August 19 order violated the Hague Convention on the \r\n  Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra-Judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial \r\n  Matters (Hague Service Convention).\r\nThe Hague Service Convention is an international treaty that pre-empts \r\n  inconsistent methods of service prescribed by state law in all cases where service \r\n  abroad is required.  Volkswagenwerk v. Schlunk, 486 U.S. 694 (1988).  \r\n  Essentially, the Hague Service Convention requires each country to establish \r\n  a central authority that receives requests for service of documents from other \r\n  countries, serves the documents, and provides certificates of service.  A country \r\n  may also consent to methods of service other than a request to its central authority.  \r\n  See generally Arts. 1-11.  Specifically, Article 10(a) provides:\r\n\r\nProvided the State of destination does not object, the present \r\n  Convention shall not interfere withâ€”\r\n  \r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the freedom to send judicial documents, \r\n  by postal channels, directly to persons abroadâ€¦.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAccording to our Department of State, the Czech Republic \r\n  bound itself to the Hague Service Convention as of January 1, 1993, but objected \r\n  to Article 10(a).\r\nBy its terms, service abroad by mail is allowed under Article \r\n  10(a) where no objection has been lodged by the receiving country.  There is \r\n  considerable controversy, however, regarding whether the Hague Service Convention \r\n  applies to documents served subsequent to the service of process, and whether \r\n  Article 10(a) applies to the original service of process or whether it applies \r\n  only to subsequent documents as indicated by use of the word â€œsendâ€ rather than \r\n  â€œserve.â€  Compare Bankston v. Toyota Motor Corp., 889 F.2d 172 \r\n  (8th Cir. 1989); ARCO Electronics Control Ltd. v. Core Internatâ€™l, \r\n  794 F. Supp. 1144 (S.D. Fla. 1992) (art. 10(a) applies only to documents subsequent \r\n  to service of process); with In re: Mandukich, 87 B.R. 296 (S.D.N.Y. \r\n  1988); Schiffer v. Mazda Motor Corp., 192 F.R.D. 335 (N.D. Ga. 2000) \r\n  (Hague Service Convention applies only to service of process and not subsequent \r\n  notices).\r\nIf, as some courts have found, the Hague Service Convention \r\n  applies only to service of process, it is not applicable here.  Original service \r\n  of process in this case was accomplished in South Carolina by personal service \r\n  and there is no challenge to its validity.  Accordingly, the mailing of subsequent \r\n  documents to Husband in Prague would not violate the Hague Service Convention.\r\nOn the other hand, if the Hague Service Convention applies \r\n  and Article 10(a) allows only subsequent documents to be served by mail, a receiving \r\n  countryâ€™s decision to opt out of Article 10(a) amounts to a decision to forbid \r\n  the use of the mails entirely.  See Randolph v. Hendry, 50 F. \r\n  Supp. 572, 577-78 (S.D.W.Va. 1999).  Under this interpretation, Husband claims \r\n  the mailings to Prague violate the Hague Service Convention.\r\nThere is no definitive precedent on the merits of this issue \r\n  and we need not resolve the issue here.  Like Husbandâ€™s due process argument \r\n  discussed above, the issue of service in compliance with the Hague Service Convention \r\n  was never raised to the family court.  Accordingly, we decline to address it.  \r\n  Smith v. Smith, 275 S.C. 494, 272 S.E.2d 797 (1980) (issue not raised \r\n  to family court not preserved for review on appeal).\r\nSimilarly, Husband raises for the first time on appeal a \r\n  violation of the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil \r\n  and Commercial Matters (Hague Evidence Convention) to which the Czech Republic \r\n  also bound itself as of January 1, 1993.  \r\nUnlike the Hague Service Convention, the Hague Evidence Convention \r\n  is not mandatory.  It essentially allows discovery abroad through Letters of \r\n  Request executed by a central authority designated by the signatory country.  \r\n  Arts. 1-3.  This procedure is not mandatory and simply provides a method of \r\n  seeking evidence that a court may elect to employ.  Societe Nationale \r\n  Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States District Court for the Southern District \r\n  of Iowa, 484 U.S. 522, 541 (1987).  By failing to raise the Hague Evidence \r\n  Convention to the family court, Husband has waived any argument regarding its \r\n  application.  See Murphy v. Reifenhauser KG Maschinenfabrik, 101 \r\n  F.R.D. 360 (D. Vt. 1984) (partyâ€™s delay in raising issue of Hague Evidence Convention \r\n  during course of discovery a factor in declining to order compliance). \r\nb.  \r\n  Rule to Show Cause\r\nHusband complains he was not properly served the \r\n  Rule to Show Cause heard by the family court as part of the final hearing on \r\n  November 1, 1999, and upon which Husband was found in contempt for failure to \r\n  make the June 1999 $83,333 payment from the proceeds of the sale of Patria stock.  \r\n  Husband contends service was invalid under the Hague Service Convention and \r\n  therefore the family court had no jurisdiction to find him in contempt.\r\nThe record includes an affidavit of personal service \r\n  of the Rule to Show Cause in Prague, signed by Wifeâ€™s private investigator and \r\n  notarized, indicating Husband saw the documents as they were being handed to \r\n  him on the street and he refused to take them.  The investigator picked up the \r\n  documents from the ground and â€œdesisted from further attempts to deliver the \r\n  papers.â€  \r\nThe Hague Service Convention clearly applies to \r\n  the service of process.  Volkswagenwerk, supra.  A contempt proceeding \r\n  regarding contemptuous conduct outside the presence of the court, as here, must \r\n  be commenced by service of process, which includes a rule to show cause.  State \r\n  v. Johnson, 249 S.C. 1, 152 S.E.2d 669 (1967).  The Hague Service Convention \r\n  requires that such process be served through the Central Authority of the signatory \r\n  country.  \r\nWhen service is challenged, the record must affirmatively \r\n  show that service of process was correctly made.  Jensen v. Doe, 292 \r\n  S.C. 592, 358 S.E.2d 148 (Ct. App. 1987) citing Matheson v. McCormac, \r\n  186 S.C. 93, 195 S.E.122 (1938).  Here, there is no indication that service \r\n  was attempted through the Central Authority of the Czech Republic.  Under Article \r\n  15 of the Hague Service Convention, process must be served â€œby a method prescribed \r\n  by the internal lawâ€ of the signatory country or actually delivered to the defendant \r\n  or to his residence.  The record does not indicate either of these conditions \r\n  was met and accordingly it appears service of the Rule to Show Cause was not \r\n  accomplished in compliance with the Hague Convention.\r\nHusband never raised this issue, however, which, \r\n  assuming he never received notice of the contempt charge until entry of the \r\n  final order, he could have raised by post-trial motion.  Service of process \r\n  under the Hague Service Convention relates to personal jurisdiction.  Objections \r\n  to personal jurisdiction, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, are waived unless \r\n  raised.  Shinn v. Kreul, 311 S.C. 94, 427 S.E.2d 695 (Ct. App. 1993); \r\n  see also Garner v. Houck, 312 S.C. 481, 435 S.E.2d 847 (1993) \r\n  (failure to timely assert improper service waives any issue regarding its validity); \r\n  Republic Leasing Co. v. Haywood, 329 S.C. 562, 495 S.E.2d 804 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (lack of personal jurisdiction may always be waived).  The family court \r\n  was never asked to rule on whether service of the Rule to Show Cause was proper.  \r\n  Accordingly, Husband has waived this issue.\r\nWe note the better practice here would have been \r\n  for the family court to appoint an agent for service when Husbandâ€™s counsel \r\n  was relieved.  See Rule 4(e), SCRCP (â€œWhenever . . . an order of court \r\n  provides for service of a summons and complaint or of a notice, or an order \r\n  upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the State, service shall be \r\n  made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by the . . . orderâ€).  \r\n  In the alternative, counsel should comply with the Hague Service Convention \r\n  when engaging in transnational domestic litigation.\r\n4.  \r\n  Valuation of marital property\r\nHusband complains the family court valuation of the Hartig \r\n  stock at $300,000 was without evidentiary support.  We disagree.\r\nThe Hartig company invested in several Prague restaurants.  \r\n  The $300,000 valuation for Husbandâ€™s Hartig stock is supported by Wifeâ€™s testimony \r\n  based on her opinion as follows:\r\n\r\nA:  Because the business owns this set of restaurants and \r\n  basically if I were a buyer coming in and I wanted to buy them what would be \r\n  attractive to me is that they have the sites.  I donâ€™t have to go out and find \r\n  them and set them up.  They have the employees and staff and they have the franchise, \r\n  the name or brand awareness and anything else.  So I just cannot imagine that \r\n  somebody most likely would either be a wealthy Czech investor or a foreign investor \r\n  would come in and buy seven restaurants in, you know, choice areas of Prague \r\n  for less than say a million dollars or so and probably more than that.  Um, \r\n  these are somewhat the femoral (sic) values as any pricing is but I just, \r\n  um - given my knowledge of turnover in these types of areas and that - thatâ€™s \r\n  the assessment I would make.\r\n\r\nHer testimony further indicates she was familiar with Prague \r\n  real estate generally and the Hartig restaurants in particular.  \r\nOpinion testimony of a nonexpert who has sufficient \r\n  knowledge of the value of the property in question or who has ample opportunity \r\n  for forming a correct opinion of it is admissible.  Whether a witness is properly \r\n  qualified is a question primarily addressed to the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  judge.  Newton v. Boggs, 274 S.C. 268, 262 S.E.2d 741 (1980).  Here, \r\n  no objection was made to Wifeâ€™s testimony.  The evidence supports her qualification \r\n  to testify regarding the valuation of Husbandâ€™s interest in Hartig.\r\nFurther, Husband did not respond to Wifeâ€™s request \r\n  to admit that his interest in Hartig had a value of $300,000 and this fact is \r\n  therefore deemed admitted under Rule 36(a), SCRCP.  Although Husband complains \r\n  this request to admit was not properly served in compliance with the Hague Evidence \r\n  Convention as discussed above, this issue was never raised to the family court \r\n  and therefore is not preserved.\r\nIn conclusion, the family courtâ€™s valuation of \r\n  Husbandâ€™s interest in Hartig is supported by the record.\r\n5.  Bench warrant\r\nAs part of the final December 21,1999, order, the \r\n  family court found Husband in contempt for failure to make the June 1999 payment \r\n  of $83,333 as required by the 1998 temporary order.  In the December 21 order, \r\n  the family court sentenced Husband to four months unless he purged himself by \r\n  making the payment directly to Wife.  As discussed above, Husband appealed this \r\n  contempt finding on the ground service of the Rule to Show Cause was improper.  \r\n  That appeal was filed January 28, 2000.\r\nMeanwhile, on January 26, 2000, a bench warrant \r\n  was filed pursuant to the December 21 order.  Husband subsequently obtained \r\n  an order signed by Judge Smoak authorizing him to deposit $166,666 with the \r\n  court in an interest-bearing account.  This amount would cover two $83,333 payments \r\n  -- the June 1999 payment for which Husband was held in contempt, and the December \r\n  1999 payment which by then had become due.\r\nHusband then moved before Judge Segars-Andrews \r\n  to quash the bench warrant based on his deposit of funds with the court.  By \r\n  order filed November 27, 2000, Judge Segars-Andrews denied the motion finding \r\n  the family court lacked jurisdiction since the contempt finding was on appeal.  \r\n  Husband moved for the same relief before Judge Armstrong.  By order filed March \r\n  19, 2001, Judge Armstrong denied the motion to quash for the same reason given \r\n  by Judge Segars-Andrews.  \r\nHusband contends Judge Armstrong erred in finding the family \r\n  court had no jurisdiction to quash the bench warrant because of the pending \r\n  appeal.  We agree but find the motion to quash was properly denied.\r\nAn order of civil contempt is not automatically stayed on \r\n  appeal.  In re:  Decker, 322 S.C. 212, 471 S.E.2d 459 (1995).  An order \r\n  that is not automatically stayed remains enforceable while pending appeal unless \r\n  the party seeks a stay.  See Rule 225(c)(1), SCACR.  The lower court \r\n  has jurisdiction to determine a partyâ€™s motion for a stay in the first instance.  \r\n  Rule 205, SCACR.  Further, the lower court retains jurisdiction â€œover matters \r\n  not affected by the appeal including the authority to enforce any matters not \r\n  stayed.â€  Rule 225(a), SCACR.  Here, the continued viability of the bench warrant \r\n  is a matter within the family courtâ€™s authority to enforce its unstayed contempt \r\n  order.  The family court therefore retained jurisdiction to decide the merits \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s motion to quash.\r\nIn this case, however, Judge Armstrong could not overrule \r\n  the prior order of Judge Segars-Andrews.  Charleston County Dept. of Soc. \r\n  Servs., 317 S.C. 283, 454 S.E.2d 307 (1995).  Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™s unappealed \r\n  ruling finding no jurisdiction is therefore the law of the case.  In re: \r\n  Morrison, 321 S.C. 370, 468 S.E.2d 651 (1996).  Moreover, as discussed below, \r\n  we find on the merits the motion to quash was properly denied.  \r\n6.  \r\n  Deposit of funds as purging contempt\r\nHusband contends his deposit of funds with the family court \r\n  amounted to a purge of his contempt and therefore the bench warrant should have \r\n  been quashed.  We disagree.\r\nFirst, the December 21 order specifically directed \r\n  Husband to pay the outstanding $83,333 directly to Wife.  Judge Smoakâ€™s \r\n  order allowing the deposit of funds did not, and in fact could not, alter Judge \r\n  Armstrongâ€™s prior order requiring that Husband pay Wife directly in order to \r\n  purge himself of contempt.\r\nFurther, Rule 67 may not be used as a means of \r\n  altering the legal duties of the parties.  Renaissance Enterprises, Inc. \r\n  v. Ocean Resorts, Inc., 334 S.C. 324, 513 S.E.2d 617 (1999).  Where payment \r\n  has been ordered and not appealed, and a contempt order is issued to compel \r\n  payment, a deposit of funds under Rule 67 will not constitute a purge.  Husband \r\n  never contested the original order that he pay Wife from the proceeds of the \r\n  sale of Patria stock and he remains legally obligated to make these payments \r\n  to Wife.  The deposit of uncontested funds with the court does nothing but delay \r\n  payment of funds that are legally due.  This is not the intent of Rule 67. [5] \r\nIn conclusion, we find Husband did not purge himself \r\n  of contempt by depositing the funds with the court and the motion to quash was \r\n  properly denied.  Further, in light of our affirmance of the contempt finding \r\n  as discussed in Issue 3b above, we order the funds dispersed to Wife and, upon \r\n  payment to Wife, the bench warrant shall be quashed.\r\n7.  \r\n  Attorneyâ€™s fees\r\nIn conjunction with his order denying Husbandâ€™s motion to \r\n  quash the bench warrant, by order filed April 30, 2001, Judge Armstrong awarded \r\n  Wifeâ€™s counsel attorneysâ€™ fees and costs -- to Mr. Rosen, $2,500, and to Ms. \r\n  Varner, $7,500.  Husband contends these amounts are excessive and the judge \r\n  failed to consider whether Wife could pay her own fees.\r\nIn support of the request for attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  costs, Mr. Rosen submitted an affidavit of $2,970 in fees and costs for defending \r\n  Husbandâ€™s motion to quash.  Ms. Varner submitted an affidavit of $8,065.85.  \r\n  These amounts exceed the amounts awarded.  There is no basis to find the fees \r\n  awarded excessive as a matter of law.\r\nFurther, in awarding these fees, Judge Armstrong considered \r\n  the factors set forth in Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  313 (1991).  While noting the case was not â€œcomplex,â€ Judge Armstrong emphasized \r\n  that Husband had previously brought the same motion to quash which was denied \r\n  by Judge Segars-Andrews.  By bringing the same motion twice, Husband had forced \r\n  Wife to expend these amounts in fees and costs.  A claim for fees and costs \r\n  may be properly awarded irrespective of whether the requesting party is financially \r\n  able to pay where the litigation is unfounded.  Darden v. Witham, 263 \r\n  S.C. 183, 209 S.E.2d 42 (1974), overruled in part on other grounds, Glasscock \r\n  v. Glasscock, supra. \r\nIn conclusion, the amount of fees and costs awarded is supported \r\n  by the record and Judge Armstrong did not abuse his discretion in making the \r\n  award.  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 368 S.E.2d 901 (1988) (an \r\n  award of attorney's fees will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion).\r\n8.  Recrimination\r\nThe divorce decree was issued on December \r\n  22, 1999, granting Wife a divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery.  One \r\n  year later, on December 22, 2000, Husband filed a motion to vacate the decree \r\n  under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, on the ground the evidence of Husbandâ€™s adultery was \r\n  fraudulent and Husband lacked notice of the November 1, 1999, hearing. \r\n  [6]   By order dated April 19, 2001, the family court denied the motion.  \r\n  Husband appeals that denial.\r\nHusband contends the family court should have sua sponte \r\n  dismissed Wifeâ€™s complaint seeking a divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery \r\n  because Wifeâ€™s own admitted adultery amounted to recrimination.  Recrimination \r\n  is a defense to an action for divorce if the acts of recrimination charged constitute \r\n  in themselves a ground for divorce.  Jeffords v. Jeffords, 216 S.C. 451, \r\n  58 S.E.2d 731 (1950); Allen v. Allen, 287 S.C. 501, 339 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1986).  Although recrimination was never ruled on below, \r\n  [7]  Husband contends it is a jurisdictional issue and is therefore properly \r\n  before us on appeal.  This argument is without merit.\r\nHusband raised the defense of recrimination in his answer.  \r\n  The fact that recrimination was pled, however, does not affect the family courtâ€™s \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to enter a divorce decree.  See Dove v. \r\n  Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598 (1994) (subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings \r\n  in question belong).  Recrimination is not a jurisdictional issue and we decline \r\n  to address it for the first time on appeal.  Smith v. Smith, supra.\r\nFurther, although in equitably dividing the marital estate \r\n  the family court referred to Husbandâ€™s marital misconduct, the court ultimately \r\n  divided the marital assets 50/50.  In light of the family courtâ€™s finding that \r\n  the parties started out equally and contributed jointly to the acquisition of \r\n  assets, the equal division of property was not affected by the finding of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  fault.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude Husbandâ€™s appeals are without merit.  His decision \r\n  to forego participation in the family court proceedings inevitably resulted \r\n  in his failure to properly preserve for appeal any complaint regarding those \r\n  proceedings.  The orders of the family court are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Husbandâ€™s affidavit was submitted in response to Wifeâ€™s motion to dismiss \r\n    this appeal which was denied by the Court of Appeals.  Our analysis assumes \r\n    Husband had no notice of the ex parte communication until this appeal was \r\n    pending.  Cf.  Ray v. State, 527 So.2d 166 (Ala. Crim. App. \r\n    1988); Sottile v. Carney, 596 N.E.2d 140 (Ill. App. 1992) (where a \r\n    party knows of the ex parte communication but does not timely object, any \r\n    objection is waived).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] As \r\n    noted above, Husband still had retained counsel when the trial date was set \r\n    and counsel was informed of this date. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    The documents mailed after August 13 were:  Requests for Admission; Motion \r\n    to Allow Plaintiffâ€™s Appraiser Access to the Marital Home; Motion to Compel \r\n    Discovery; Motion to Lift Restraining Order; Motion for Emergency Relief; \r\n    and Notice of Deposition of Marlene Arbess.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    For instance, Husband complains that the deposition of Marlene Arbess provided \r\n    evidence of his fault.  This evidence had no impact on the equal division \r\n    of marital assets.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Husbandâ€™s \r\n    contention that he deposited the funds under Rule 67 to preserve his appeal \r\n    of the contempt finding is unpersuasive.  Husband could have sought a stay \r\n    of that order to preserve his appeal. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  \r\n    As discussed above, Husband was represented by counsel when this trial date \r\n    was set.  His claim of lack of notice is without merit.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  \r\n    The grounds for Husbandâ€™s Rule 60(b) motion do not include recrimination and \r\n    the order on appeal denying this motion does not address it. Further, Husband \r\n    never presented evidence of Wifeâ€™s admitted adultery at the final hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25587","title":"Gardner v.

The 1995 Act permits a â€œclaimant agencyâ€ to seize \r\n  the South Carolina income tax refund of a taxpayer who has a delinquent debt \r\n  with the claimant agency.   We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.  \r\n    \r\nFACTS\r\nPlaintiffs/Respondents (Plaintiffs) brought this declaratory \r\n  judgment action against Defendants/Appellants (Defendants) asserting Defendants, \r\n  as claimant agencies, improperly seized their income tax refunds.  Plaintiffs \r\n  sought injunctive relief, the return of their seized tax refunds, and damages.  \r\n  In addition, Plaintiffs sought to be certified as class representatives of all \r\n  taxpayers who incurred a reduction in their income tax refund in the amount \r\n  of $100 or more and requested the Defendants be certified as class representatives \r\n  of all claimant agencies which had availed themselves of the 1995 Act by recovering \r\n  debts of $100 or more.  \r\nThe trial judge granted Plaintiffsâ€™ motion for summary judgment. \r\n  Through a series of orders, the trial judge 1) held certain notices did not \r\n  substantially comply with the 1995 Act 2) refused to presently consider the \r\n  Named Defendantsâ€™ counterclaims against the Named Plaintiffs, 3) ordered the \r\n  return of seized income tax refunds for 1996, 1997, and 1998, plus related administrative \r\n  fees and interest, 4) ordered a return of administrative fees, plus interest, \r\n  collected by Defendants/Appellants Municipal Association of South Carolina (MASC) \r\n  and South Carolina Association of Counties (SCAC) [3]  in 1999, and 5) enjoined the South Carolina Department of Revenue \r\n  (DOR) from collecting any claims submitted by the Associations for tax year \r\n  1999.   In addition, the trial judge certified a bilateral class action.  Thereafter, \r\n  the trial judge denied Intervenors/Appellants (Intervenors) petition to intervene \r\n  as parties in the matter.  Defendants appeal. \r\n  [4]   \r\nI.  ISSUES RELATING TO THE 1995 ACT\r\nIn 1988, the General Assembly enacted the â€œSetoff Debt Collection Act.â€  Act \r\n  No. 474, 1988 S.C. Acts 4020.  This Act permits â€œclaimant agenciesâ€ to seize \r\n  the South Carolina income tax refunds of taxpayers who owe delinquent debts \r\n  to the agencies. [5]   Defendants are currently defined \r\n  as â€œclaimant agencies.â€  In relevant part, Â§ 12-56-60(A) of the 1995 Act provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nA request for setoff [by the claimant agency to the DOR] may be made only \r\n  after the claimant agency has notified the debtor of its intention to cause \r\n  the debtorâ€™s refund to be set off.  This notice must be given in \r\n  person, left at the dwelling or usual place of business of the debtor, or sent \r\n  by certified or registered mail to the debtorâ€™s last known address no less than \r\n  thirty days before the claimant agencyâ€™s request to the [DOR].  The notice \r\n  shall include a statement which sets forth administrative appeal procedures \r\n  available to the debtor and alternatives available to the debtor which could \r\n  prevent setoff.  The claimant agency promptly shall notify the debtor when the \r\n  liability out of which the set off arises is satisfied. \r\n\r\n(Underline added). \r\nSection 12-56-60(B) provides:\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the certification of the claimant agency \r\n  of the amount of the delinquent debt, the [DOR] shall determine if the debtor \r\n  is due a refund.  If the debtor is due a refund of more than twenty-five dollars, \r\n  the DOR shall set off the delinquent debt against the amount of the refund in \r\n  excess of twenty-five dollars and transfer the amount set off to the claimant \r\n  agency.  The department may retain an amount not to exceed twenty-five dollars \r\n  of each refund set off to defray its administrative expenses. . . The [DOR] \r\n  shall consider any certified delinquent debt and debtor list provided by a claimant \r\n  agency as correct.  Reviews of refund setoffs are with the claimant agency.  \r\n  If, after appropriate review the claimant agency determines that the setoff \r\n  amount is excessive, it shall refund the appropriate amount to the taxpayer.  \r\n  If, after appropriate review, the claimant agency determines that it is entitled \r\n  to no part of the amount set off, it shall refund the entire amount plus the \r\n  administrative fee retained by the [DOR].  That portion of the refund reflecting \r\n  the administrative fee must be paid from claimant agency funds.  If a refund \r\n  has been retained in error, the claimant agency shall pay interest to the taxpayer \r\n  calculated as provided in Section 12-54-20 from the date provided by law after \r\n  which interest is paid on refunds until the appeal is final . . .  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge held those claimant agencies whose 1996, 1997, \r\n  or 1998 notices were included on lists designated as â€œCategory 1â€ or â€œCategory \r\n  2â€ failed to substantially comply with the statutory notice requirement of Â§ \r\n  12-56-60(A).  The trial judge described Category 1 notices as those â€œwithout \r\n  mention of an â€˜administrative appealâ€™ but at best a name and phone number to \r\n  call in case that taxpayer had a questionâ€ and Category 2 notices as â€œthose \r\n  notices which make some mention of an appeal but do not â€˜include a statement \r\n  which sets forth administrative appeals procedures available to the debtorâ€™.â€   \r\n\r\nA.  Notice\r\n Defendants argue the trial judge erred by holding the Category 1 and Category \r\n  2 notices did not substantially comply with Â§ 12-56-60(A).  They contend the \r\n  information provided by the Category 1 and Category 2 notices adequately set \r\n  out the â€œreview procedureâ€ as contemplated by the statute.  Accordingly, Defendants \r\n  contend the notices complied with due process and, therefore, substantially \r\n  complied with Â§ 12-56-60(A).  We disagree.  \r\nInitially, we note the issue is not whether the Category 1 or 2 notices \r\n  complied with the requirements of constitutional due process.  [6]   Instead, the issue is whether \r\n  the notices complied with the requirements of Â§ 12-56-60(A).  [7]   The General Assembly legislatively established \r\n  the due process required by the 1995 Act.  \r\nThe primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give \r\n  effect to the intent of the legislature.  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington \r\n  v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 476 S.E.2d 690 (1996).  Where the terms of the relevant \r\n  statute are clear, there is no room for construction.  Parsons v. Georgetown \r\n  Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 355 (1995).    \r\n The plain language of Â§ 12-56-60(A) requires that \r\n  the notice of a tax refund setoff  â€œshall include a statement which sets forth \r\n  administrative review procedures available to the debtor. . .â€.  The Category \r\n  1 notices which provided a telephone number and, perhaps, the name of a contact \r\n  person, clearly did not meet the mandatory provision of the statute.  While \r\n  the Category 2 notices informed the taxpayer he/she could â€œrequest a reviewâ€ \r\n  by calling or writing the claimant agencyâ€™s Setoff Debt Collection department \r\n  within a specified length of time, the notices did not â€œset forth administrative \r\n  appeal procedures availableâ€ as specified by Â§ 12-56-60(A).  Advising the taxpayer \r\n  he/she may â€œrequest a reviewâ€ within a declared deadline is not the equivalent \r\n  of â€œset[ting] forth administrative appeal procedures.â€\r\nDefendants rely on South Carolina Second Injury Fund v. American \r\n  Yard Products, 330 S.C. 20, 496 S.E.2d 852 (1998), and Davis v. Nationscredit \r\n  Fin. Servs. Corp., 326 S.C. 83, 484 S.E.2d 471 (1997), to suggest that, \r\n  while the Category 1 and Category 2 notices may not have specified the administrative \r\n  appeal procedures available as provided by Â§ 12-56-60(A), the notices were nonetheless \r\n  adequate.  The cited cases hold that compliance with the technical requirements \r\n  of a notice statute may be excused where the parties received the substance \r\n  of the statutorily required notice.  Here, however, the Category 1 and 2 notices \r\n  did not provide Plaintiffs with the substance - the claimant agencyâ€™s administrative \r\n  appeal procedure - required by the statute.  Accordingly, American Yard Products \r\n  and Davis are inapplicable.  \r\nFinally, some Defendants claim that subsequent \r\n  amendments to the 1995 Act demonstrate the legislative intent of the 1995 Act \r\n  was not to require an explanation of all administrative appeal procedures in \r\n  the notice.  We disagree.\r\nIn 1999, the General Assembly substantially amended the Setoff Debt \r\n  Collection Act.  Act No. 114, 1999 S.C. Acts 1177.  That portion of the 1995 \r\n  Act requiring â€œ[t]he notice shall include a statement which sets forth administrative \r\n  appeal procedures available to the debtorâ€ was deleted in the 1999 Act.  Section \r\n  12-56-62 was added to the 1999 Act.  This provision states:  \r\n. . . The notice must include a statement of appeal \r\n  procedures available to the debtor substantially as follows:\r\n\r\nAccording to our records, you owe the (claimant agency) a debt in the \r\n  amount of (amount of the debt) for (type of debt).  You are hereby \r\n  notified of the (claimant agencyâ€™s) intention to submit this debt to \r\n  the South Carolina Department of Revenue to be set off against your individual \r\n  income tax refund.  Pursuant to the Setoff Debt Collection Act, this amount, \r\n  plus all costs, will be deducted from your South Carolina individual income \r\n  tax refund unless you file a written protest within thirty days of the date \r\n  of this notice. . . The protest must contain the following information: \r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your name;\r\n(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your address;\r\n(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your social security number;\r\n(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the type of debt in dispute; and\r\n(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a detailed statement of all the reasons you disagree \r\n  or dispute the debt.\r\n  \r\nThe original written protest must be mailed to the \r\n  (claimant agency) at the following address: \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (address of the \r\n  entity requesting the setoff). \r\n\r\nIn addition, the 1999 Act established a uniform \r\n  procedure governing the protest of setoff claims.  Under the 1999 Act, a claimant \r\n  agency is required to appoint a hearing officer to consider the protest of a \r\n  taxpayer before submitting the claim to the DOR.  Further, the claimant agency \r\n  is required to notify the DOR that it has received a protest and it must hold \r\n  an informal hearing before the DOR may proceed with the setoff.  If the hearing \r\n  officer rules in favor of the claimant agency, the DOR may proceed with the \r\n  setoff, even though the taxpayer may appeal the adverse decision to the Administrative \r\n  Law Judge Division or, in some circumstances, file a summons and complaint with \r\n  the circuit court.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-56-63; Â§ 12-56-65; Â§ 12-56-67 (2000).   \r\n\r\nUnder the 1995 Act, a claimant agency could proceed with its claim \r\n  with the DOR after giving the taxpayer thirty days notice of its intent to seek \r\n  setoff, regardless of whether the taxpayer sought review.  Â§ 12-56-60(A) and \r\n  (B) (Supp. 1996).  Review was with the claimant agency in accordance with its \r\n  own procedures.  Â§ 12-56-60(B).  \r\nWhile Defendants correctly assert that subsequent amendments may be \r\n  interpreted as clarifying the legislative intent behind existing law, Hyde \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 314 S.C. 207, 442 S.E.2d 582 (1994), \r\n  the 1999 Act does not clarify the notice provisions of the earlier legislation \r\n  as the two versions of the Setoff Debt Collection Act are significantly different.  \r\n  Because each claimant agency had its own unique review procedure under the 1995 \r\n  Act, that Act reasonably required the claimant agencies to include â€œa statement \r\n  set[ting] forth administrative appeal proceduresâ€ in the notice.  Because the \r\n  1999 Act established a standard review procedure for all claimant agencies, \r\n  it eliminated the need for providing the administrative appeal procedures of \r\n  the particular claimant agency.  Taxpayers can obtain the uniform review procedure \r\n  by referring to the statute.          \r\nWe conclude the trial judge properly held the Category 1 and Category \r\n  2 notices did not substantially comply with the notice requirements of the 1995 \r\n  Act.  \r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prejudice  \r\nDefendants argue that, even if the pre-setoff notices were statutorily inadequate, \r\n  each Plaintiff is required to establish prejudice in that he/she would have \r\n  taken action upon receipt of a sufficient notice and had a valid defense to \r\n  the underlying debt.  We agree. \r\nAs a general rule, a party must establish prejudice as the result \r\n  of anotherâ€™s failure to follow mandatory statutory procedure.  See Rose \r\n  v. Beasley, 327 S.C. 197, 489 S.E.2d 625 (1997) (where statutory pre-removal \r\n  hearing was not provided, party nonetheless failed to establish prejudice where \r\n  received post-removal hearing); see also Porter v. South Carolina \r\n  Public Serv. Commâ€™n, 338 S.C. 164, 525 S.E.2d 866 (2000) (Court reversed \r\n  agency decision where it found substantial prejudice from lack of notice).  \r\n  Where a party receives inadequate notice, he must demonstrate prejudice resulting \r\n  from the insufficient notice.  Ballenger v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health \r\n  and Envtl. Control, 331 S.C. 247, 500 S.E.2d 193 (Ct. App. 1998) (even though \r\n  applicantâ€™s notice was misleading, opposing party was not prejudiced); Long \r\n  v. Bd. of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys., 117 F.3d 1145 (10th \r\n  Cir. 1997) (although party did not receive adequate notice of potential penalty, \r\n  he failed to establish he could have obtained better outcome, therefore, failed \r\n  to establish prejudice).  Even where a party receives no notice, he must establish \r\n  that, had he received notice, he would have taken pertinent action and could \r\n  have reduced his liability.  Boley v. Brown, 10 F.3d 218 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1993).  \r\nIn granting summary judgment in favor of the Named and Class Plaintiffs, \r\n  the trial judge did not specifically address the issue of prejudice, but apparently \r\n  determined violation of the notice provision of the 1995 Act constituted prejudice \r\n  in and of itself.  This was erroneous.  It may well be that, had some taxpayers \r\n  received a notice which complied with the 1995 Act, they would have opted not \r\n  to protest their income tax setoff for various reasons, one being they owed \r\n  the delinquent debt to the claimant agency.  Further, we find it likely that, \r\n  if they had filed protests, some taxpayers would not have prevailed:  they would \r\n  not have established their debts were not due and owing.\r\nC.  Collection \r\n  Costs\r\nDefendants argue the trial judge erred by holding claimant agencies \r\n  were not entitled to add collection costs to Plaintiffsâ€™ underlying debts.  \r\n\r\nSince its inception in 1988, the Setoff Debt Collection Act has provided \r\n  that â€œclaimant agencies may submit for collection under the procedure \r\n  established by this article all delinquent debts which they are owed.â€  \r\n  Act No. 474, 1988 S.C. Acts 4022 (underline added); Act No. 76, 1995 S.C. Acts \r\n  521 (substituted â€œchapterâ€ for â€œarticleâ€). \r\nAs originally enacted, \r\n  the Setoff Debt Collection Act did not include the Associations within the definition \r\n  of â€œclaimant agency.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-54-420(1) (Supp. 1989).  In 1992, \r\n  the General Assembly amended the definition of â€œclaimant agency.â€  Under the \r\n  amended provision, the MASC and SCAC were defined as  â€œpolitical subdivisionsâ€ \r\n  (and, therefore, claimant agencies) â€œwhen these organizations submit claims \r\n  on behalf of their members.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-54-420(1) (Supp. 1993).  In \r\n  1994, the legislature again amended the Setoff Debt Collection Act, adding the \r\n  MASC and SCAC are â€œpolitical subdivisionsâ€ (and, therefore, claimant agencies) \r\n  â€œwhen these organizations submit claims on behalf of their members and other \r\n  political subdivisions.â€  Act No. 516, 1994 S.C. Acts 5916. \r\nOriginally, the Setoff Debt Collection Act defined â€œdelinquent debtâ€ as:\r\n\r\n[A]ny liquidated sum due and owing any claimant agency, \r\n  including court costs, fines, penalties, and interest which have accrued through \r\n  contract, subrogation, tort, operation of law, or any other legal theory regardless \r\n  of whether there is an outstanding judgment for that sum which is legally collectible \r\n  and for which a collection effort had been or is being made.  \r\n\r\nAct No. 474, 1988 S.C. Acts 4022. \r\nIn 1994, the General Assembly amended the definition \r\n  of â€œdelinquent debtâ€ as follows:  \r\n\r\n[A]ny liquidated sum due and owing any claimant agency, \r\n  including collection costs, court costs, fines, penalties, and interest \r\n  which have accrued through contract, subrogation, tort, operation of law, or \r\n  any other legal theory regardless of whether there is an outstanding judgment \r\n  for that sum which is legally collectible and for which a collection effort \r\n  has been or is being made.  \r\n\r\nAct No. 516, 1994 S.C. Acts 5916 (underline added). [8]   \r\nSince 1992 the MASC and SCAC have participated in the setoff  \r\n  collection process by consolidating and forwarding delinquent debts on behalf \r\n  of claimant agencies to the DOR.  In exchange for their collection efforts, \r\n  the MASC and SCAC add $25 and $15, respectively, as an administrative fee to \r\n  each â€œsuccessful setoffâ€ submitted on behalf of a claimant agency to the DOR.  \r\n  Some claimant agencies which avail themselves of the Associationsâ€™ procedures \r\n  also add a collection fee to the underlying debt.  Not all claimant agencies \r\n  pursue collection through the MASC or SCAC.  Some agencies which pursue tax \r\n  setoffs on their own add a collection fee.   \r\nThe trial judge ruled the 1995 Act did not permit automatic recovery \r\n  of collection costs or administrative fees assessed by the Associations or claimant \r\n  agencies.  Instead, he held the recovery of costs or fees was permissible only \r\n  if they â€œaccrued through contract, subrogation, tort, operation of law, or any \r\n  other legal theory  . . .â€.   \r\nDefendants argue the trial judge misconstrued the provisions permitting \r\n  recovery of collection costs.  Specifically, they claim the statute provides \r\n  for the recovery of â€œany liquidated sum due and owing a claimant agencyâ€ and \r\n  â€œcollection costsâ€ is not limited by the phrase â€œaccrued through contract, subrogation, \r\n  tort, operation of law, or any other legal theory.â€  We disagree.\r\nThe primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give \r\n  effect to the intent of the legislature.  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington \r\n  v. Altman, supra.  Where the terms of the relevant statute are clear, \r\n  there is no room for construction.  Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, supra.   \r\n\r\nThe language of the 1995 Act indicates the legislatureâ€™s clear intent \r\n  to define â€œdelinquent debtsâ€ expansively.  As originally provided by the Setoff \r\n  Debt Collection Act, â€œdelinquent debtâ€ was defined as any liquidated \r\n  sum due and owing any claimant agency, including . . . which \r\n  have accrued through contract, subrogation, tort, operation of law, or any \r\n  other legal theory . . .â€.  Act No. 474, 1998 S.C. Acts 4022 (underline \r\n  added).  The only â€œlimitationâ€ is that the cost be legally recognizable (i.e., \r\n  that the cost accrues through a legal theory).  The legislature later added \r\n  â€œcollection costsâ€ to its definition of recoverable debt and retained the â€œlegally \r\n  recognizableâ€ requirement.  Act No. 516, 1994 S.C. Acts 5916.  Accordingly, \r\n  we conclude the trial judge did not err by holding, in order to be recoverable \r\n  through the Setoff Debt Collection Act, collection costs must accrue via some \r\n  legal theory.          \r\nD.  Associationsâ€™ Liability\r\nAssociations argue the trial judge erred by holding them liable to the Named \r\n  and Class Plaintiffs for return of the seized income tax refunds and interest.  \r\n  We agree. \r\nThe 1995 Act required the claimant agency seeking the \r\n  income tax setoff to provide the statutorily required notice to the delinquent \r\n  taxpayer.  Â§ 12-56-60(A).  In addition, it provided any review of refund setoffs \r\n  was through the claimant agency.  Â§ 12-56-60(B).  If the claimant agency determined \r\n  a setoff was excessive, the claimant agency was to provide the refund and interest.  \r\n  Id.  \r\nThese statutory provisions indicate the legislature clearly intended the refund \r\n  of any excessive income tax setoff be made by the claimant agency who collected \r\n  the setoff.  Similarly, any claimant agencyâ€™s failure to follow the statutory \r\n  procedure should result in liability by the claimant agency, not the Associations. \r\n  [9]    \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;   ISSUES RELATING TO THE 1999 ACT  \r\n The Associations, DOR, and other Defendants argue the trial judge erred by \r\n  holding the collection fees assessed by the Associations pursuant to 1999 amendments \r\n  to the Setoff Debt Collection Act are unconstitutional.  We agree.\r\nAs noted above, the General Assembly substantially amended the Setoff Debt \r\n  Collection Act in 1999.  In part, the legislature added Â§ 12-56-63(B) as follows:\r\n\r\nAn association defined as a political subdivision in \r\n  Section 12-56-20(1) may contract with another political subdivision for the \r\n  processing of debts to be submitted to the [DOR].  These services may be funded \r\n  through an administrative fee. . . .  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge held â€œ[t]he portion of the 1999 Act which purports \r\n  to allow the Associations to seize from taxpayersâ€™ refunds a collection fee \r\n  unspecified and unlimited in amount . . . is unconstitutional, as a denial of \r\n  due process and equal protection.â€  \r\n  [10]   The trial judge ordered a return of fees, plus interest, collected \r\n  for tax year 1999 to Plaintiff class members. \r\n  [11]     \r\nAll statutes are presumed constitutional and will, if possible, \r\n  be construed so as to render them valid.  Davis v. County of Greenville, \r\n  322 S.C. 73, 470 S.E.2d 94 (1996).  The substantive due process guarantee ensures \r\n  legislation which deprives person of a life, liberty, or property right has, \r\n  at a minimum, a rational basis, and is not arbitrary or overly vague.  Treatment \r\n  and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d 338 (2000).  The burden \r\n  of showing that a statute is unreasonable falls on the party who attacks it \r\n  on due process grounds.  State v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 484 S.E.2d 869 \r\n  (1997).  \r\nNamed Plaintiffs have not established the 1999 Actâ€™s failure to \r\n  provide a cap on the administrative fees assessed by the Associations violates \r\n  substantive due process.  Named Plaintiffs did not establish the General Assembly \r\n  had no rational basis for permitting the Associations to assess taxpayers for \r\n  processing setoffs for claimant agencies.  Instead, we find the General Assembly \r\n  determined the Associationsâ€™ ability to consolidate and process setoff claims \r\n  was of administrative benefit both to the claimant agencies and to the DOR.  \r\n  Furthermore, Plaintiffs failed to establish the fees actually charged ($15 or \r\n  $25) were arbitrary or unreasonable.  The failure of the statute to set a cap \r\n  for a particular charge does not, standing alone, violate substantive due process.  \r\nFurther, Named Plaintiffs failed to establish that that portion of \r\n  the 1999 Act which permits the Associations to assess a fee for processing claims \r\n  on behalf of claimant agencies violates equal protection.  Murphy v. Richland \r\n  Memorial Hospital, 317 S.C. 560, 455 S.E.2d 688 (1995) (party asserting \r\n  unconstitutionality of statute on equal protection grounds has burden of showing \r\n  classification is essentially arbitrary and without any reasonable basis).  \r\n  While those taxpayers whose claimant agencies did not use the Associationsâ€™ \r\n  services would not be assessed a fee, there is clearly a reasonable basis to \r\n  permit the disparate treatment - the Associations should be permitted to recover \r\n  a reasonable fee from taxpayers for consolidating and processing the setoffs \r\n  for claimant agencies.  Using the Associationsâ€™ services results in cost savings \r\n  and administrative convenience for both the DOR and those claimant agencies \r\n  who use the Associationsâ€™ service.  Id.  (to satisfy equal protection, \r\n  statutory classification must bear reasonable relation to legislative purpose \r\n  sought to be achieved, members of class must be treated alike under similar \r\n  circumstances, and classification must rest on some rational basis).   \r\nWe conclude the trial judge erred by holding the fee provision of \r\n  the 1999 Act violated due process and equal protection.  \r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nISSUES \r\n  RELATING TO CLASS CERTIFICATION  \r\nDefendants argue the trial \r\n  court erred in granting class certification.  We agree.\r\nProponents of class certification bear the burden of proving five prerequisites \r\n  under South Carolina law.  See Waller v. Seabrook Island Property \r\n  Owners Assâ€™n, 300 S.C. 465, 388 S.E.2d 799 (1990); Rule 23(a), SCRCP.  The \r\n  prerequisites are:  1) the class must be â€œso numerous that joinder of all members \r\n  is impracticable;â€ 2) there must be â€œquestions of law or fact common to the \r\n  class;â€ 3) the â€œclaims or defenses of the representative parties [must be] typical \r\n  of the claims or defenses of the class;â€ 4) â€œthe representative parties [must] \r\n  fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class;â€ and 5) â€œthe amount \r\n  in controversy [must] exceed[] one hundred dollars for each member of the class.â€  \r\n  Rule 23(a), SCRCP.  The first four criteria are often referred to as the requirements \r\n  for numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy of representation.\r\nIn deciding whether class certification is proper, the court must apply a rigorous \r\n  analysis to determine each prerequisite is satisfied.  Waller v. Seabrook \r\n  Island Property Owners Assâ€™n, supra.  We generally defer to the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s discretion in granting class certification absent an error of law. [12]   Id.  \r\nBecause failure to satisfy even one prerequisite is fatal to class certification \r\n  we limit our discussion to the Named Plaintiffsâ€™ inability to prove commonality. [13]   See id. (failure to satisfy \r\n  all five prerequisites is fatal to class certification).  To establish commonality, \r\n  a party must show that â€œthere are questions of law or fact common to the class.â€  \r\n  Rule 23, SCRCP.  In practical terms this means the party must articulate the \r\n  existence of â€œsignificant common, legal, or factual issuesâ€ which bind the proposed \r\n  class together.  Boggs v. Divested Atomic Corp., 141 F.R.D. 58, 64 (S.D. \r\n  Ohio 1991). \r\nCritically, â€œ[n]ot every issue in the case must be common to all class members.â€ \r\n  Oâ€™Connor v. Boeing North Amer., Inc., 184 F.R.D. at 311, 329 (C.D.Cal.1998).  \r\n  Commonality is met only where the class shares a determinative issue.  See \r\n  Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134, 145 (4th Cir.1990) (â€œcertification is \r\n  proper only when a determinative critical issue overshadows all other issues; \r\n  and â€œquestion[s] [that are] in no way dispositive and [which] simply propel \r\n  the action into a posture where judicial scrutiny is necessary for just adjudicationâ€ \r\n  are insufficient to establish commonality under Rule 23(a)(2), FRCP); see \r\n  also Peoples v. Wendover Funding Inc., 179 F.R.D. 492, 498 (D. \r\n  Md.1998) (â€œa representative plaintiff cannot establish commonality . . . if \r\n  the court must investigate each plaintiff's individual claim.â€).\r\nPlaintiffs assert a â€œcommon threadâ€ exists among its \r\n  class members concerning  whether Defendantsâ€™ actions were proper \r\n  in seizing income tax refunds without proper notice.  We disagree.\r\nThere are at least two common questions of law in this case relating to the \r\n  1995 Act:  1) whether the Defendantsâ€™ notices pursuant to the 1995 Act were \r\n  deficient and 2) whether Plaintiffs were prejudiced by the alleged  deficiency.  \r\n  Even if the notices were deficient, Plaintiffs cannot prevail unless they establish \r\n  they were prejudiced by the insufficiency.  See Rose v. Beasley, \r\n  supra; Porter v. South Carolina Public Serv. Commâ€™n, supra; \r\n  Ballenger v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, supra.  \r\n\r\nThis is not a typical class action where minor factual differences exist among \r\n  the individualized cases of class members.  See, e.g., Monaco \r\n  v. Stone, supra.  Instead, the factual differences (whether prejudice \r\n  exists) are the crux of a predominant legal issue.  A representative class cannot \r\n  exist where the court must investigate each plaintiffâ€™s prejudice claim where \r\n  it is one of the two predominate issues in the case.  Requiring such individualized \r\n  examination negates the benefits of a class action suit.  See Oâ€™Quinn \r\n  v. Beach Associates, 272 S.C. 95, 104, 249 S.E.2d 734, 738 (S.C. 1978) (â€œThe \r\n  very purpose of a class action is to avoid the necessity of requiring each member \r\n  of the class to prove the elements of the cause of action.â€).\r\nLikewise, Named Plaintiffs cannot show that commonality exists for the defendant \r\n  class.  A court determines the existence of commonality among defendants by \r\n  examining the plaintiffsâ€™ claims and the defendantsâ€™ anticipated defenses.  \r\n  See Kline v. Coldwell Banker &amp; Co., 508 F.2d 226 (9th \r\n  Cir. 1974).  As with Plaintiffs, Defendantsâ€™ anticipated defenses center upon \r\n  the predominant issue of whether Plaintiffs were prejudiced by the deficient \r\n  notices.  Such a defense necessitates forming legal arguments around the individual \r\n  facts of each case to show whether prejudice may or may not exist.\r\nWe conclude the trial judge erred by certifying both a plaintiff \r\n  and a defendant class. [14] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn summary, the trial judge abused his discretion \r\n  by granting Plaintiffsâ€™ request to certify this matter as a bilateral class \r\n  action.  Accordingly, the Named Plaintiffs and Named Defendants are the proper \r\n  parties in this matter.  \r\nFurthermore, while Named Defendantsâ€™ setoff notices failed \r\n  to comply with the requirements of the 1995 Act, the trial judge erred by failing \r\n  to determine whether each Named Plaintiff was prejudiced by the inadequate notice.  \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the entry of summary judgment.  This matter is remanded \r\n  to the circuit court which shall then remand the matter to the  Named Defendant \r\n  claimant agencies.  The claimant agencies are hereby ordered to determine whether \r\n  the Named Plaintiff whose income tax refund was setoff by the agency in tax \r\n  years 1996, 1997, or 1998 was prejudiced by the inadequate notice.  This determination \r\n  involves consideration of the Named Defendantsâ€™ defenses and counterclaims.  \r\n  If the claimant agency concludes the Named Plaintiff was prejudiced, it shall \r\n  issue a refund of the setoff tax return in accordance with the Setoff Debt Collection \r\n  Act.  If the claimant agency concludes the Named Plaintiff was not prejudiced, \r\n  the Named Plaintiff may appeal in accordance with the provisions of Â§ 12-56-65 \r\n  (2000).\r\nThe trial judge properly held the Named Defendants and Associations \r\n  were not entitled to assess collection fees against the Named Plaintiffs under \r\n  the 1995 Act unless the fees accrued through contract, subrogation, tort, operation \r\n  of law, or any other legal theory.  Accordingly, in addition to the issue of \r\n  prejudice, each Named Defendant claimant agency shall determine whether it or, \r\n  if applicable, the Associations, were authorized to assess a collection fee \r\n  from the Named Plaintiff. [15]   If the claimant agency determines \r\n  it was not authorized to collect all or a portion of the assessed fee, the Named \r\n  Defendant shall refund the excess amount.   \r\nAccordingly, the orders of the trial judge are AFFIRMED \r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED for further action in compliance \r\n  with this opinion.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  Henry F. Floyd, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Act No. 76, 1995 S.C. Acts 521.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Act No. 1144, 1999 S.C. Acts 1177.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    At times, the MASC and SCAC are referred to jointly as â€œthe Associations.â€  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    At times, Named Defendants, Class Defendants, and Intervenors are referred \r\n    to collectively as â€œDefendants.â€  At other times, we refer to Defendants individually.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    In the 1995 Act, â€œclaimant agencyâ€ is defined as â€œa state agency, board, committee, \r\n    commission, public institution of higher learning, political subdivision, \r\n    and the Internal Revenue Service.  It also includes a private institution \r\n    of higher learning for the purpose of collecting debts related to default \r\n    on authorized educational loans made pursuant to Chapters 111, 113, or 115 \r\n    of Title 59.  â€˜Political subdivisionâ€™ includes the Municipal Association of \r\n    South Carolina and the South Carolina Association of Counties when these organizations \r\n    submit claims on behalf of their members or other political subdivisions.â€  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-56-20(1) (Supp. 1996).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  \r\n    The trial judge expressly declined to rule whether the Category 1 or Category \r\n    2 notices complied with due process.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  \r\n    Anderson v. White, 888 F.2d 985 (3rd Cir. 1989), cited by Defendants, \r\n    is inapposite.  In Anderson, the taxpayers argued the pre-offset notices \r\n    did not satisfy due process, not whether the notices satisfied the applicable \r\n    United States Code provision.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  \r\n    â€œDelinquent debtâ€ was again revised in 1996.  In relevant part, the amendment \r\n    deleted the requirement that the delinquent debt be liquidated.  Act No. 395, \r\n    1996 S.C. Acts 2415.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]  \r\n    We question whether the 1995 Act creates a private right of action which can \r\n    be enforced by taxpayers.  The statute does not expressly provide a cause \r\n    of action for taxpayers.  Moreover, it appears the 1995 Act does not create \r\n    an implied right of action.  See Camp v. Springs Mortgage Corp., \r\n    310 S.C. 514, 426 S.E.2d 304 (1993) (test to determine whether right of private \r\n    action in favor of certain party is created by implication under civil statute \r\n    is whether legislation was enacted for special benefit of the party).  The \r\n    Setoff Debt Collection Act was created for the benefit of claimant agencies \r\n    who are owed delinquent debts by taxpayers.  While the Act provides for notice \r\n    prior to the setoff of income tax refunds, violation of the notice provision \r\n    does not evince a legislative intent to create a private right of action.  \r\n    The â€œremedyâ€ provided by Â§ 12-56-60(B) only suggests refund by the claimant \r\n    agency â€œif the setoff amount is excessive,â€ not for failure to follow the \r\n    setoff procedures.  Nevertheless, we decline to rule on this issue.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [10]  \r\n    At the hearing, the trial judge allowed Plaintiffs to amend their complaint \r\n    to add a cause of action stating the fee provision of the 1999 Act was unconstitutional.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [11]  \r\n    Since the plaintiff class is â€œcomposed of all persons who had their 1996, \r\n    1997, or 1998 South Carolina income tax refund seizedâ€ by certain enumerated \r\n    agencies, we assume the trial judge meant only the Named Defendants would \r\n    reimburse those Named Plaintiffs who had their 1999 taxes seized.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [12]  \r\n    This case is significantly more complex due to the fact it is a bilateral \r\n    class action.  That is, Named Plaintiffs seek to have the court certify both \r\n    a plaintiff class and a defendant class.  Both the Federal Rules and the South \r\n    Carolina Rules allow for bilateral class actions.  See Rule 23(a), \r\n    SCRCP, and Rule 23(a), FRCP (both using the introductory phrase â€œOne or more \r\n    members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf \r\n    of all. . .â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [13]  \r\n    During oral argument, Named Plaintiffs asserted they were properly certified \r\n    as class representatives of taxpayers who had been improperly assessed a collection \r\n    fee during tax years 1996, 1997, and 1998.  We disagree.  We note the collection \r\n    fees do not meet the monetary threshold of $100.  Rule 23(a), SCRCP.  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [14]   While we decline to specifically address the \r\n    requirement of typicality, we reject Named Plaintiffsâ€™ request for us to adopt \r\n    the â€œjuridical links doctrine.â€  See La Mar v. H &amp; B Novelty \r\n    and Loan Co., 489 F.2d 461 (9th Cir. 1973); Doss v. Long, \r\n    93 F.R.D. 112 (N.D. Ga. 1981).  We note the doctrine has recently come under \r\n    close scrutiny primarily due to its conflict with Article III standing issues.  \r\n    See, e.g., William D. Henderson, Reconciling the Juridical \r\n    Links Doctrine with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Article III, \r\n    67 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1347 (2000).  The doctrine also runs counter to this Courtâ€™s \r\n    previous decisions which hold that a plaintiff may not sue a defendant unless \r\n    the plaintiff has suffered an injury at the hands of the defendant.  Edisto \r\n    Fleets, Inc., v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 256 S.C. 350, 182 S.E.2d \r\n    713 (1971) (A plaintiff cannot maintain a class action where record indicates \r\n    he was not directly harmed by defendants actions); Furman University v. \r\n    Livingston, 244 S.C. 200, 136 S.E.2d 254 (1964) (only a taxpayer directly \r\n    affected by erroneously paying taxes has a right to seek a refund).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [15]  \r\n    We recognize the trial judge considered whether some Named Defendants had \r\n    legal theories which permitted them to assess collection costs against the \r\n    Named Plaintiffs.  Because it is unclear which Named Defendants the trial \r\n    judge considered, this issue is remanded for consideration by all Named Defendant \r\n    claimant agencies.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25588","title":"Green v.
