Mackay, of Anderson, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: The State appealed an order requiring it to pay fees incurred to hire an expert to examine Frank Gary Cooper (\"Cooper\") in conjunction with a trial pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to -170 (Supp. 1999). The State simultaneously \r\n\r\nfiled a Petition for a Writ of Supersedeas or for Clarification in the Court of\r\nAppeals and a Petition for an Extraordinary Writ with this Court, which was\r\ndenied as moot. This Court certified this case for review pursuant to Rule\r\n204(b), SCACR, and, pending the disposition of the merits of the appeal, stayed\r\nthe portion of the order on appeal that directed the Attorney General's office to\r\npay the expert's fee within ten days of the order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State initiated an involuntary civil commitment process for the long-term control, care, and treatment of Cooper as a sexually violent predator pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-10 (Supp. 1999). On August 5,1991, Cooper was convicted in Anderson County for Criminal Sexual Conduct with a Minor, Second Degree, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for fifteen years. Cooper has previous convictions from Tennessee for Rape and Assault and Battery with Intent to Fondle a Female Under 12 years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 22, 1998, a probable cause hearing was held to determine whether there was enough evidence to find Cooper was a sexually violent predator. At the hearing, the trial judge found that probable cause had been established and required Cooper to submit to a psychiatric evaluation. Cooper's attorney requested funding for an independent psychiatric examination. The attorneys and the trial judge noted that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 1999) did not specify the entity responsible for paying the fee. The trial court found that Cooper was entitled to an independent examination by an expert and ruled that the Office of Indigent Defense should pay the expert's fee. The trial judge further ordered, without objection, that if funds were unavailable from the Office of Indigent Defense; the fee would be paid by the Attorney General's office. 1 The trial court also directed that compensation for Cooper's expert would be subject to approval. by the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 2,1999, the trial court approved the expenditure of $1,500.00 for the retention of Cooper's expert psychiatrist, Dr. Helen Marie Clark. The \r\n  trial court further found that Cooper was incarcerated and indigent and in need of funds to properly prepare his defense. However, the Order was silent as to the funding source. On February 12,1999, the Attorney General's office sent a letter claiming the office had no money to pay the expert fees and should not be ordered to pay. On April 29, 1999, the Office of Indigent Defense sent a letter to Cooper's attorney indicating that the Sexually Violent Predator Act makes no one responsible for the payment of expert fees. According to the Office of Indigent Defense, no money had been appropriated for the payment of these services and the funds that were available were restricted to the payment of trial expenses in criminal matters or in Post-Conviction Relief cases. The Office of Indigent Defense claimed that it could not voluntarily use its resources to pay for the expenses because it was currently facing a severe financial crisis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 3,1999, a bench trial was held and the trial judge found Cooper was a sexually violent predator, and he was committed for treatment. The trial judge found that Cooper's social and psycho-sexual history, his poor prognosis for successful treatment due to his unwillingness or inability to recognize the extent of his illness, and his prior convictions for sexually violent offenses prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Cooper suffers from a mental abnormality that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secured facility for long-term control, care, and treatment. The Order did not address Cooper's expert fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 7, 1999, the State filed a Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion asserting that the earlier orders of the court regarding payment of expert fees by the Attorney General's office were void, or in the alternative, asking the trial judge to hold that they were no longer equitable under Rule 60(b)(5). On June 10, 1999, the trial judge denied the post-trial motions and directed the Attorney General's office to pay the $1,500.00 expert fee within ten days of the Order. On June 17, 1999, the State filed a Notice of Appeal in the Court of Appeals appealing the portion of the orders requiring the Attorney General's office to pay the expert fees. The State's Notice of Intent to Appeal references only the Rule 60(b) Order and the November 1998 and February 1999 Orders. The State also moved in the circuit court for a stay pending the appeal in the event the appeal did not automatically stay the Order to pay the fee. The circuit court denied the motion to stay. Also on June 17, 1999, the State filed a Petition for a Writ of Supersedeas in the Court of Appeals requesting a stay in the event the Notice of Appeal did not automatically stay the portions of the orders on appeal. On June 18, 1999, the Court of Appeals issued a stay which was subsequently dissolved on June 30, 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1999, the State filed a Petition for Extraordinary Relief and Memorandum in this Court. The State notified this Court that the stay issued by the Court of Appeals had been dissolved and requested that this Court hear the appeal and stay the orders on appeal, if the Orders were not automatically stayed. This Court certified the case for review and stayed the portion of the Order on appeal that directed the Attorney General's office to pay the expert's fee. The following issues have been certified for review: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1)Is the State's appeal timely and, therefore, properly before this Court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)Does the Court of Appeals have authority to decide a dispute as to whether an exception to the automatic stay contained in Rule 225, SCACR applies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)Does the exception to the automatic stay contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-9-130 (1985) apply in this case?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)Does the circuit court have the authority to order the Attorney General to pay the expenses of the expert?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp.1999) constitute a continuing appropriation that authorizes the State to pay expert witness fees for indigents from the General Fund?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) Does Act No. 100, 1999 S.C. Acts 355 authorize payment of expert witness fees by the Office of Indigent Defense?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7) Are any other sources of state funding available to pay expert witness fees including, but not limited to, appropriations to the Judicial Department for Judicial Commitment or appropriations to the Department of Mental Health for the Sexually Violent Predators Act?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Timeliness of the Appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues its appeal was timely and, therefore, properly before this Court from final judgment entered on June 10, 1999. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal in this case was timely because the judgment on appeal was not final and appealable until after the issuance of the June 10, 1999 Order. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976), only final judgments and limited interlocutory orders are appealable. 2 The funding issue was merely hypothetical and not ripe for appeal before the cause of action was concluded, the fee was approved by the trial court, and the request for payment was denied by the Office of Indigent Defense. The issue did not become ripe for appeal until the trial judge ordered the Attorney General to pay the expert fees on June 10,1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Baber v. Greenville County, 327 S.C. 31, 488 S.E.2d 314 (1997) (this Court generally declines to pronounce a declaration wherein the rights of a party are contingent upon the happening of some event which cannot be forecast and which may never take place).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1999, the State filed: (1) a Notice of Appeal in the Court of Appeals; 3 (2) a Motion to Stay Orders Pending Appeal in the trial court; (3) a Petition for Writ of Supersedeas or for Clarification in the Court of Appeals; and (4) a Petition for an Extraordinary Writ in this Court. The State filed its Notice of Appeal within thirty days of the order disposing of Cooper's Rule 59, SCRCP motion. When either party files a timely Rule 59, SCRCP motion, the time to appeal for all parties is stayed until the motion in resolved. Rule 203 (b)(1), SCACR; Rule 59 (f), SCRCP. The State, therefore, filed the appropriate motions and acted in a timely manner to appeal the June 10, 1999 Order directing it to pay the expert fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Court of Appeals' Authority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that the Court of Appeals has authority to decide whether an exception to the automatic stay contained in Rule 225, SCACR is applicable. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly's recent amendments to the South Carolina Code, effective June 1, 1999, expanded the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and provided for filing of cases directly in the Court of Appeals rather than the Supreme Court. Included in those amendments was section 14-8-200, which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [Court of Appeals] shall have the same authority to issue writs of supersedeas, grant stays, and grant petitions for bail as the Supreme Court would have in a similar case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 1999) (emphasis added). These recent amendments provided the Court of Appeals with jurisdiction over the appeal and, therefore, the authority to decide whether the automatic stay rule contained in Rule 225, SCACR was applicable to the instant case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Kearney v. Allen, 287 S.C. 324, 338 S.E.2d 335 (1985), we held that when there is a dispute as to whether an automatic stay exists under our rule, 4 \"authority to resolve such a dispute is vested in the Supreme Court.\" When Kearney was decided, our appellate procedural rules provided that appeals were filed and finalized in the Supreme Court, then transferred to the Court of Appeals. Since disagreements over the meaning of the rules almost always arose while jurisdiction over the appeal was vested in the Supreme Court, it was sensible that the Supreme Court resolve the disputes. Under our current procedure, the vast majority of appeals are filed, processed, and decided by the Court of Appeals. We, therefore, modify Kearney and hold the Court of Appeals has the power and the authority to rule upon issues arising under SCACR, including those arising under Rule 225.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Automatic Stay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that the filing of the Notice of Appeal acted to automatically stay the June 10, 1999 Order. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As a general rule, the service of a notice of appeal in a civil matter acts to automatically stay matters decided in the order on appeal, and to automatically stay the relief ordered in the appealed order, judgment, or decree.\" Rule 225, SCACR. Certain exceptions to this general rule are found in statutes, court rules, and case law. Id. Section 18-9-130 provides that a notice of appeal does not act as a stay of a judgment directing the payment of money unless the presiding judge before whom the judgment was obtained grants a stay of execution. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-9-130 (1976). The term \"judgment\" used in the statute and rule connotes a final decision of the court that addresses the merits of the cause of action and disposes of the cause as to all. Link v. School Dist. of Pickens, 302 S.C. 1, 393 S.E.2d 176 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe payments in this case are not \"money judgments\" within the contemplation of section 18-9-130. See Pelzer Mfg. Co. v. Cely, 40 S.C. 430, 18 S.E. 790 (1894) (section 18-9-130 applies to judgments directing money be paid by one party to another party) (emphasis added). Expert fees are matters incidental to the case and do not constitute a traditional judgment as contemplated by the statute. Therefore, because the payment of expert fees is a collateral issue, no exception applies and the circuit court orders were automatically stayed by the filing of the notice of appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.The Circuit Court's Authority to Order the Attorney General's Office to Pay for the Expert's Expenses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that the circuit court erred in ordering the Attorney General's office to pay the expert's expenses. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a party to the lawsuit, the Attorney General, acting as an embodiment \r\n\r\nof the State, becomes subject to the authority of the court. Once the State subjects itself to the jurisdiction of the court, the court has the authority to direct the State to employ and compensate experts in order to maintain the integrity of the judicial process. In State v. Locklair, Op. No. 25161 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 26, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 27 at 1) we held that a trial judge can order an independent psychiatric examination of a defendant in a death penalty case when he or she believes that mental competency may be an issue at trial. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court found that \"[i] n order to protect the legal process and preserve the integrity of the trial, a trial judge should have the authority to order a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant when his or her competency may be in question.\" Id. at 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the trial judge in this case has the inherent authority to require an expert examination of an indigent and direct which party should pay for the examination. If the State's theory is correct, and the State could not pay for anything unless it was specifically appropriated, a trial court would never have the authority to require the State to pay for its obligations. For example, under the State's theory, a trial court would not have the authority to direct the State to pay for its tort obligations unless such obligations were specifically appropriated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the issue of the expert's fees arose at the first hearing. The Attorney General representing the State not only failed to object to the judge's oral ruling that the Attorney General's office would be. contingently liable for the fee, but drafted the order. Prior to the filing of the Rule 60(b) motion, the only indication that the Attorney General's office found the payment provision to be unacceptable was a cover letter accompanying a proposed order that did not address the payment issue. The record demonstrates that the Attorney General's office essentially consented to the November order, and as such, cannot now appeal it. See, e.g., Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 513 S.E.2d 358 (1999). For this same reason, the Attorney General's office cannot now challenge the February Order authorizing the expenditure of $1,500.00. Further, we agree with the circuit court that the fact the Attorney General's office subsequently regretted its decision to agree to pay does not render the order \"void\" or \"no longer equitable\" under Rule 60(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Continuing Appropriation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 1999) constitutes a continuing appropriation that authorizes the State to pay expert witness fees for indigents from the general fund. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn appropriation may be made by a permanent continuing statute. Grimball v. Beattie, 174 S.C. 422, 177 S.E. 668 (1934). A continuing appropriation is an appropriation running on from year to year without further legislative action until the purpose of levy and appropriation has been accomplished. State ex rel. Edwards v. Osborne, 195 S.C. 295, 11 S.E.2d 260 (1940); see also Cox v. Bates, 237 S.C. 198, 116 S.E.2d 828 (1960) (finding no provision in the South Carolina Constitution which prohibits continuing appropriations); Dacus v. Johnston, 180 S.C. 329, 185 S.E.491 (1936) (defining continuing appropriations as payments to be continued beyond the term or session of the Legislature by which they are made).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that section 44-48-90 constitutes a continuing appropriation because it provides that the circuit court shall \"approve payment\" of expert fees for an indigent person's defense in an action pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act. We find that this is a strained reading of the statute. Section 44-48-90 does not operate as an appropriation of money that is to carry over from year to year, it merely gives the circuit court the authority to review the expert fees and approve them if they are reasonable. The statute is silent as to the source of the funding. Section 44-48-90 is not a continuing appropriation statute because it does not contemplate that a specific amount of money will be spent annually until the statute is repealed by the Legislature. See, e.g., Dacus, supra (holding that an act which authorizes the Highway Commission to appoint a chief highway commissioner fixed the manner of the payment of his salary by a continuing appropriation each year); Briggs v. Greenville County, 137 S.C. 288, 135 S.E.153 (1926) (discussing continuing appropriations in terms of payments from special funds set aside to pay for specific projects such as highway construction).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Appropriations Act\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that Act No. 100, 1999 S.C. Acts 355 (the \"Act\") authorizes payment of expert witness fees by the Commission on Indigent Defense for future cases but not the instant matter. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 35.5 of Part IB of the Act states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[t]he funds appropriated under \"Civil Court Appointments\" shall be used for Civil Court Appointments including Termination of Parental Rights, Abuse and Neglect, Probate Court Commitments, Sexually Violent Predator Act, and Post Conviction Relief (PCR) to reimburse court appointed private attorneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). The appropriation is not limited to attorney's fees, but applies broadly to the reimbursement of attorneys. Accordingly, the appropriation may be used to reimburse private attorneys for experts they have hired to defend an action brought under the Sexually Violent Predator Act. However, this provision will apply to future cases because the provision was not in place at the time this action was initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the Office of Indigent Defense indicated that they did not have the money to pay for the expert's fees because they are \"currently facing a severe financial crisis.\" As stated above, the trial court has the authority to employ experts and direct the payment of expert expenses by the parties in the lawsuit. Because the Office of Indigent Defense did not have enough money to pay for the fees at the time of the lawsuit, the circuit court properly ordered the Attorney General's office to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Other Available Sources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that there are no other sources of State funding available to pay expert witnesses in this type of case. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 10.13 of Part IB of the Act, the provision dealing with the Department of Mental Health, sets up a sexual predator program with funds that \"may be used to reimburse the Department for expenses associated with the program in fiscal year 1998-1999.\" The expert expenses in this case are not typical expenses of the Department of Mental Health, so it would not be covered by this provision. The Department of Mental Health's responsibilities under the Sexually Violent Predator Act include: (1) serving on a Multidisciplinary Team to assess whether or not the person satisfies the definition of a sexually violent predator, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50 (Supp. 1999); (2) providing the facility for the control, care, and treatment of such persons until his or her mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe to be at large, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100 (Supp. 1999); and (3) authorizing the release of such committed persons when the Director of the Department of Mental Health determines that the person is safe to be at large, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-120 (Supp. 1999). The Department of Mental Health's responsibilities under the Sexually Violent Predator Act do not include the payment of expert fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisions for Judicial Commitment expenses under Section 30.4 of Part IB of the Act do not apply to expert fees because it does not expressly include the Sexually Violent Predator Act. The appropriations for the Judicial Department are very specific and include appropriations for Judicial Commitment, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-17-510 (1976); commitment of children, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-24-10 to -280 (Supp. 1999); and treatment facilities for alcohol and drug abuse treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the trial court's orders providing for the payment of Cooper's expert fees by the Attorney General's office. MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The provision of the Sexually Violent Predator Act concerning expert witness fees states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of an indigent person who would like an expert of.his own choosing, the court shall determine whether the services are necessary. If the court determines that the services are necessary and the expert's requested compensation for the services is reasonable, the court shall assist the person in obtaining the expert to perform an examination or participate in the trial on the person's behalf. The court shall approve payment for the services upon the filing of a certified claim for compensation supported by a written statement specifying the time expended, services rendered, expenses incurred on behalf of the person, and compensation received in the case or for the same services from any other source. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-48-90 (Supp. 1999).\r\n2 The trial court's orders do not fall into the category of limited interlocutory orders that are directly appealable, either as orders which involve the merits of the case or which affect a substantial right. The orders did not determine any issues in the case, affect the mode of trial, or prevent a judgment from being rendered. See Mid-State Distrib., Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 S.E.2d 777 (1993).\r\n\r\n3 The State's failure to list the March final judgment in its Notice of Appeal does not preclude our review of the November 1998 and February 1999 orders, and of the Rule 60(b) order. See, e.g., Lancaster v. Fielder, 305 S.C. 418, 409 S.E.2d 375 (1991) (in timely appeal after final order, party can challenge intermediate orders).\r\n4 Kearney involves Rule 41 of the former Supreme Court Rules. Rule 225, SCACR, replaced this rule. See Appendix A, Table of Comparative Rules, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25193","title":"State v.

Cottingham, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25193Heard June 7, 2000 - Filed September 11, 2000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Deputy Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, for appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: This is a death penalty case. Appellant raises a single sentencing phase issue. We reverse and remand for resentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant David McClure murdered his father and his father's girlfriend by stabbing them. At the time of the murders, appellant was eighteen and lived with the victims. In a taped confession, appellant admitted his guilt and alleged Satan had ordered him to kill the victims. The State sought the death penalty. The solicitor rejected appellant's offer to plead guilty. Appellant presented no evidence at the guilt phase and did not testify at either phase. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in permitting the solicitor to refer to appellant's lack of remorse during closing argument in the sentencing phase?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant did not testify at the guilt or sentencing phases of the trial. In the closing argument in the guilt phase, appellant's counsel stated that appellant had tears running down his cheeks when the tape of his statement was played and was \"very sorry about what's happened here.\" Further, counsel stated, \"From the time this thing happened David's been sorry. He's been remorseful.\" 1  In the opening argument in the sentencing phase, the solicitor referred to appellant's lack of remorse. Appellant objected. The trial judge overruled the objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her closing argument in the sentencing phase, the solicitor then stated: .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . [L] et's talk mitigation. Is there any mitigation? Is there anything that says, hey, is he truly sorry? Does he truly want to make it better? You know, those are, the things that you are entitled and I want you to consider, 'cause that's part of the job you all have. And you're going to hear, the judge is gonna say, \"Consider it,  if you want to.\" What can we tell you about this defendant, about this defendant that will help you? No remorse whatsoever. 2 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou heard from the family members, his friends, his associates, the people at the jail, the doctors, the psychologist, that this defendant has no remorse whatsoever. Whatsoever.No one, no one, could - even his mother - could take this stand, put their hand on the Bible, sit in this chair. and say, \"He didn't want to do it. He was truly sorry.' No one could come up here, put - sit in this chair and tell you all that there is, have been in any way whatsoever, any remorse for the double murders of David McClure, Senior, and Donna Fitzpatrick. None. None. There has been no remorse ... You know there is no remorse. There's no appropriate \"I'm sorry.\" I didn't - you know \"I wish I could take it back. \" No.. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm confident by his actions, by his deeds, by his lack of remorse, by his desire to be as big and bad as he can be, he will do it again ...Appellant objected on the ground the solicitor had commented on appellant's right to remain silent. Appellant also pointed out that the solicitor had been sitting in the witness chair when she argued that no one had testified about appellant's remorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant asked for a curative instruction. The trial judge stated he would instruct the jury that generally \"the defendant doesn't have to testify and they can't use that fact against him.\"' The trial judge specifically declined to give a curative instruction because he ruled the comments were appropriate. The trial judge also stated that he thought appellant had \"[opened] the door\" when appellant had referred to remorse initially. The fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination extends to the penalty phase of a capital case. State v. Hawkins, 292 S.C. 418, 357. S.E.2d 10 (1987). 3  A corollary of the right to remain silent is the prohibition against prosecutorial comment upon the failure to testify. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965); Hawkins, supra. This constitutional prohibition, however, does not preclude a prosecutor from making \"a fair response to a claim made by defendant or his counsel.\" United States v. Robinson, 485 U.S. 25, 32, 99 L.Ed.2d 23, 108 S. Ct. 864 (1988) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Robinson, defense counsel mentioned several times in his closing argument that the government did not allow the defendant, who did not testify, to explain his side of the story and had unfairly denied him the opportunity to explain his actions. The prosecutor in rebuttal remarked that the defendant \"could have taken the stand and explained to you anything he wanted to. The United States of America has given him, throughout, the opportunity to explain.\" 108 S.Ct. at 867. The Supreme Court held the prosecutor's statements, in light of defense counsel's comments, did not infringe upon the defendant's fifth amendment rights. The Court held that those rights are violated when a prosecutor, on his own initiative, asks the jury to draw an adverse inference from a defendant's silence or to treat such silence as substantive evidence of guilt. The Court also held no violation of the privilege'takes place,, however, when the prosecutor's reference to the defendant's opportunity to testify is a fair response to a claim by the defense. 4 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that the State's comments in this case are a far cry from the restrained rebuttal sanctioned by the Supreme Court in Robinson and are not a fair response to the two comments made by defense coun.sel. Although here defense counsel did invite some comment on the remorse issue, the solicitor could have fairly responded by referring to the lack of evidence showing remorse without specifically commenting on the failure of appellant to take the stand and apologize. If the solicitor had stopped prior to commenting on the lack of an \"I'm sorry\" or \"I wish I could take it back,\" we might agree with the State that the solicitor was merely responding to appellant's comments about remorse. However, in our opinion, the solicitor's argument went too far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State cites Six v. Delo, 94 F.3d 469 (8th Cir. 1996) as a case \"almost directly on point.\" We disagree. In Six, the comments about remorse were prefaced with a reference to the jury's observance of the defendant during the trial. The court held the prosecutor's comments about remorse were remarks on the defendant's general demeanor in the courtroom and not about a failure of the defendant to take the stand and express remorse. In contrast, here the solicitor, while sitting in the witness stand, commented specifically upon the fact that appellant had not stated \"I'm sorry\" or \"I wish I could take it back.\" Here, the solicitor's comments were not a fair response and cannot be seen as a reasonable response to the defense's argument of remorse. Thus, the trial court erred in overruling appellant's objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur review of the closing argument is based upon whether the solicitor's comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denialof due process. State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 422 S.E.2d 133, 146 (1992); State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe note the evaluation of the consequences of an error in the sentencing phase,of a capital case are more difficult because of the discretion that is given to the sentencing jury. A capital jury can recommend a life sentence for any reason or no reason at all. State v. Atkins, 303 S.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d 760 (1990); State v. Tyner, 273 S.C. 646, 258 S.E.2d 559 (1979). State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, in this capital case, the solicitor's comments are reversible error. The solicitor repeatedly emphasized the fact that appellant had not shown remorse and had not testified. This focused the jury's attention on an improper consideration - on whether appellant had to testify and express remorse to avoid the death penalty. Further, as the trial judge stated, the issue of appellant's remorse in this case \"bears on the question of [appellant's] future dangerousness.\" Thus, we find the solicitor's comments so infected the sentencing phase of appellant's trial with unfairness as to make the resulting death sentence a denial of due process. Accordingly, appellant's sentence is reversed and the case is remanded for resentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In appellant's closing argument in the sentencing phase, counsel again stated appellant had tears running down his cheeks when the taped confession was being played and that appellant was \"so sorry for what has happened.\"\r\n\r\n2 At this point in the argument, appellant's counsel and the trial judge held a bench conference after which the argument resumed. After the argument was completed, the trial judge sent the jury out and stated that appellant had objected timely and then addressed appellant's objection. \r\n3 The fifth amendment, as applicable to the States through the fourteenth amendment, provides that \"No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . .\"  \r\n4 Appellant points to the reversible error the court has previously found in State v. Hawkins, 292 S.C. 418, 357 S.E.2d 10, 13 (1987) (\"remorse is not an appropriate matter for consideration by the jury when a defendant pleads not guilty and does not testify\") and State v. Sloan, 278 S.C. 435, 298 S.E.2d 92 (1982) (Court found egregious error in State's closing argument during sentencing phase when State argued: \"Has anyone said to you he's sorry, sorry for what he did? ... What have you been told up until you found him guilty. He has pled not guilty ... Is that someone who wants to be rehabilitated?\").. However, these cases did not address the \"invited response\" argument now before us. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25194","title":"In the Matter of Huskey","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25194","description":"","date":"2000-09-11","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Huskey\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n            In the Matter of Willard Vandy Huskey,                      Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n                           Opinion No.  25194     \r\nSubmitted August 1, 2000 - Filed September 11, 2000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n            Henry B. Richardson and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n            Willard Vandy Huskey, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. 1 In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to disbarment from the practice of law. We accept the agreement for disbarment. The facts in the agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Client Files\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent worked at the Henson Law Firm (Firm) as an Equity Associate until November 1998. Although respondent does not recall retaining client files, respondent's wife brought a box of respondent's case files into the Firm after respondent was discharged. Respondent was not aware of his wife's actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Social Security Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent represented a client in a Social Security disability action for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability (SSD). The client was awarded SSI in the fall of 1997. Respondent billed the client for 25% of his past due SSI benefits because the Social Security Administration does not withhold attorney fees out of SSI awards. Client forwarded a cashier's check in the amount of $1,452 payable to respondent on October 22, 1997. Client was later awarded SSD, and the Social Security Administration withheld $4,000 as attorney's fees out of the client's past due benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    In April 1998, the client tried to get a refund of the $1,452 from respondent without any success. The Firm's manager investigated, but could find no records of the $1,452 being deposited into the firm escrow account. Respondent gave misleading statements to the office manager about whether he would resolve the matter personally. Respondent admitted to cashing the client's check and converting all of the money for his own personal use. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent falsely stated that he refunded the $1,452 to the client after he received the $4,000 from the Social Security Administration. Respondent accused the client's wife of stealing the check and cashing it without client's knowledge. He produced an altered cancelled check for the $1,452 he had allegedly refunded to the client. However, there was no date on the back of the cancelled check where it had been processed by the bank. Respondent subsequently refunded the $1,452 out of his personal funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Failure to Prosecute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent prepared a Summons and Complaint on behalf of a client. The Summons and Complaint was served approximately thirty days after its filing. The case was later dismissed for failure to prosecute one year after the filing of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Statute of Limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent failed to terminate representation of a client in a matter which lacked merit. Respondent also failed to advise this client that the statute of limitations was about to expire. Respondent then failed to take action within the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Tennessee Action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Respondent represented a client involved in a motor vehicle accident in Tennessee. Respondent failed to file suit or associate a Tennessee lawyer to file suit, within the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Failure to Appear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent represented another client involved in a motor vehicle accident which occurred on April 10, 1994. Respondent filed suit in Newberry County on April 10, 1997. Opposing counsel filed a Motion to Dismiss the action, arguing that the statute of limitations had run on the action. Respondent did not appear at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The court was unable to contact respondent at the time of the hearing, despite having given him proper notice of the hearing. Respondent went on vacation at the time of the hearing, but he failed to protect his absence by notifying the court or the opposing party. The court issued an order allowing respondent ten additional days to prove that the statute of limitations had riot expired. Respondent did not respond to the court. The client's case was dismissed with prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Settlement Funds Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent represented a client in a matter which was settled for $15,000. Prior to receiving the money, respondent allegedly loaned the client $10,000 without reducing the transaction to writing or suggesting that the client consult independent counsel. He failed to have the client sign a release in this matter. Respondent has no documentation to support his assertion that he loaned the client the funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    A check was later issued which was payable to the client and respondent. The draft was endorsed and negotiated. None of the funds were deposited into the client escrow account at the Firm or at any other firm's escrow account. On June 30, 1998, the entire $15,000 was deposited into a passbook savings account at First Federal Bank, in the name of another client or \"W. Vandy Huskey, her Attorney.\" This was not a trust or escrow account, and the other client named on the passbook savings account was unrelated to the client awarded the $15,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   With the $15,000 in his personal account, respondent considered $10,000 of the funds to be reimbursement for the loan to the client. He later disbursed $2,000 to the client and converted the remaining funds to his personal use. Respondent failed to reduce that transaction to writing, failed to suggest that the client consult independent counsel about the transaction, and has no written documentation to support his claim that the funds were disbursed in that manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    On July 15, 1998, respondent transferred $12,000 from the passbook savings account to a joint checking account he held with his wife. Respondent purchased an automobile with those funds. The balance in the joint account held with petitioner's wife remained below $12,000 until December 31, 1998, when a cash deposit occurred unrelated to this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Passbook Account Matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent represented two clients injured in a motor vehicle accident which occurred in 1994. Respondent settled their cases independent of the Firm and without notice to the Firm. Respondent cannot locate these clients files nor any records of the financial transactions related to the cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent received a settlement check for the first client for $250,001. He deposited those funds into the passbook savings account he had opened jointly in the client's name and his name at First Federal Bank, not in the Firm escrow account or any other trust account. Respondent entered several false entries on the disbursement sheet. He disbursed a fee of $73,000 to \"your firm for legal services.\" The disbursement sheet also showed disbursements to the Firm of $295 for legal expenses and $243.53 for records. None of these funds went to the Firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent also indicated on the disbursement sheet that $12,677.60 was \"to be held in trust.\" Of those funds, respondent disbursed only $1,215.12 to the client and converted the remainder to his own use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent failed to answer two letters from Cost Recovery Systems, Inc., seeking reimbursement to a medical benefits plan from the proceeds of monies recovered from third parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent settled the second client's case for $90,000. He handled her case similar to the first client, using a passbook system account and taking a fee from that account independent and outside of the Firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Failure to Cooperate with Investigation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent was contacted by letter on November 12, 1999, on January 27, 2000, and on February 9, 2000, requesting that he contact and make an appointment with the Attorney to Assist in the investigation of these matters. The Attorney to Assist filed his report with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct on February 15, 2000. Respondent did not contact the Attorney to Assist as of the date of that report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    After an informal meeting with agents of the Attorney General's office, respondent was instructed to verify the identity of the account into which the $15,000 from the Settlement Funds Matter had been deposited. Respondent stated that the funds had been deposited into a personal account at Wachovia Bank. Respondent was served a Notice to Appear, and a hearing was held on June 20, 2000. Respondent falsely testified under oath that the $15,000 from the Settlement Funds Matter was deposited into an account at First Federal Bank in the name of \"W. Vandy Huskey\" only. Respondent failed to identify the other client's name as being on that account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    By his actions, we find that respondent violated numerous provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct contained in Rule 407, SCACR. Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his clients. Rule 1.3. He failed to keep his clients informed about the status of their cases or comply with requests for information and failed to keep clients informed to the extent necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation. Rule 1.4 (a) and (b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respondent entered into prohibited business transactions with a client without giving the client a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel. Rule 1.8. He failed to maintain his clients' funds separate from his own funds, failed to keep complete records of such account funds, failed to promptly inform the client when funds were received by him, failed to promptly deliver the funds to the client, and failed to obtain an accounting and severance of respondent's interest in the funds from the clients' interests. Rule 1.15 (a), (b), and (c). Respondent failed to properly withdraw from representation of a client where the representation would result in a violation of the rules or the lawyer is discharged. Rule 1.16 (a)(1), (2), and (3). He failed to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client. Rule 3.2. Respondent knowingly made a false statement of material fact to a third person in the course of representing a client. Rule 4.1 (a). Respondent knowingly made a false statement of material fact and knowingly failed to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority. Rule 8.1 (a) and (b). Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. Rule 8.4 (a), (b), and (d). Respondent has also violated Rules 7(a)(1), (3), (5) and (6) of the RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Based on these violations, we find that respondent should be disbarred.\r\n    Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             DISBARRED.\r\n1 Respondent was suspended from the practice of law by this Court on June 12, 2000, for failure to pay license fees. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25195","title":"Buff v.

Nance, of Nance & McCants, of Aiken, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT: Petitioner Gary E. Buff was injured in an automobile accident while driving a truck for Petitioner Southeastern Freight Lines. Buff and Southeastern Freight Lines (Buff) brought these negligence actions against Respondent South Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT). 1  The jury awarded damages to Buff. DOT appealed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding the trial judge improperly sent the jury back to deliberate after it had twice stated it was deadlocked, the Court of Appeals reversed. Buff v. South Carolina Dept of Transp, 332 S.C. 472, 505 S.E.2d 360 (Ct. App. 1998) (Anderson, J., dissenting). We granted a writ of certiorari to review this decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury began deliberations at 4:25 p.m. Through a note, the jury requested a copy of a deposition. At 5:00 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom; the trial court informed the jury it could not have the deposition. The jury returned to deliberate at 5:03 p.m.The jury sent a second note requesting a definition of proximate cause. At 5:25 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom and was instructed. The jury returned to deliberate at 5:45 p.m.At 8:00 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom. The trial judge stated he had received a third note which stated: \"we are deadlocked.\" The trial judge inquired if the jury was making progress. The foreperson responded: \"No, sir. We have been deadlocked ever since we came in, went back out and we've been informed that, that the deadlock have (sic) not changed since we came back out.\" After giving an Allen charge, 2  the trial judge instructed the jury to return at 9:00 the following morning to resume deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt some point after resuming deliberations the following morning, the jury sent a fourth note which stated: \"we are deadlocked 11-1 with no chance of reaching an agreement.\" At 10:50 a.m., the jury returned to the courtroom. The trial judge stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have received your note from the bailiff that indicates that, up until this point in time, Mr. Foreman, we've been unable to reach a unanimous verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain I want to thank you for your deliberations up to this point. I did want to give you some additional instructions that may be of some benefit to you. So if you would consider this fact. If I have to declare a mistrial in the case it would require us to come back and try the case again before another jury with great cost and expense to both sides. Of course it's an important case for both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I may have indicated earlier, you were chosen because we had full confidence in your abilities to hear testimony and evidence and decide the factual issues in dispute and we still do. We believe that you're the best twelve we could ever have impaneled to hear this case. You've heard all the testimony and evidence and while I understand that you've been unable up to this point in time to reach a unanimous verdict if there is some question of law that I need to instruct you on I can certainly do that. If [sic] any question that you need further clarification on, I'll be more than happy to do that. If you need me to [sic] send me a note through the bailiff and let me know, if that's the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I'm going to ask you to try if you can to make one last effort at trying to reach a unanimous verdict, if possible. Again, I'm not going to ask any individual juror to give up his or her conscience [sic] convictions about the case just simply to reach a verdict but on the other hand I am going to ask you re-evaluate your position and if there is some question about the law, I'll be more than happy to instruct you on the law if there is some misunderstanding in that regard. But, I don't want to comment on the facts. I have no opinion about the facts. I do want you to understand the law. So if it's a question about that, you let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe factual issues in dispute must be decided by you and that's why we sent back the special verdict form to try to assist you when you make your findings. If there is a problem in the way in which the form was presented to you, let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any event I believe both sides would like, if possible, for you to reach a unanimous verdict if you can. So I'm going to continue the trial in the other case and ask you to make a continued effort to reach a unanimous verdict and let me know. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury returned to the jury room. DOT moved for a mistrial, arguing a mistrial was appropriate after the jury twice stated it was deadlocked. The trial judge refused to grant a mistrial but stated he would declare a mistrial if the jury was again unable to reach a verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt some point thereafter, the jury sent a note stating \"we are making progress.\" At 11:50 a.m. the jury returned to the courtroom and delivered a unanimous verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by holding the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant a mistrial after the jury twice indicated it was unable to reach a verdict? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1330 (1976) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a jury, after due and thorough deliberation upon any cause, returns into court without having agreed upon a verdict, the court may state anew the evidence or any part of it and explain to it anew the law applicable to the case and may send it out for further deliberation. But if it returns a second time without having agreed upon a verdict, it shall not be sent out again without its own consent unless it shall ask from the court some further explanation of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). 3 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held Â§ 14-7-1330 permits a jury to resume deliberations after it has twice stated it is unable to reach a verdict only if the trial judge informs the jury it may choose whether to continue deliberations. It found the trial judge's final words to the jury, \" [s]o I'm going to continue the trial in the other case and ask you to make a continued effort to reach a unanimous verdict and let me know,\" ordered the jury to continue deliberations until it reached a verdict and the jury's silence after the instruction could not be construed as consent. Buff 332 S.C. 472, 505 S.E.2d 360. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of  Â§ 14-7-1330 is \"to prevent forced verdicts, and to prevent undue severity of jury service.\" State v. Freely, 105 S.C. 243, 247, 89 S.E. 643, 644 (1916). 4 In Freely, the trial judge did not advise the jury it could not be required to deliberate a third time without its consent. On appeal, the Court held the question is whether, under all the circumstances, it appeared to the trial judge the jury consented to deliberate a third time. Affirming the trial court, the Court noted: \"[t1he exercise of such a discretion at so delicate stage of a trial ought not to be disturbed unless it was obviously wrongly exercised.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Rowell, 75 S.C. 494, 56 S.E. 23 (1906), the jury twice stated it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The trial court sent the jury back to deliberate for a third time; it did not inform the jury its consent was necessary in order to pursue further deliberations. The Court held there was no abuse of discretion in returning the jury to deliberate a third time where there was no indication of unwillingness on the part of the jury to retire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Drakeford, 120 S.C. 400, 113 S.E. 307 (1922), the trial judge gave the foreman instructions on how to deliver the verdict when reached. The foreman inquired, \"[sluppose we can't agree?\" and the trial judge responded, \"[olh, but you must agree; we wouldn't consider a mistrial in this case.\" The next morning, upon questioning by the trial judge, the jury stated it had not reached a verdict. After giving an Allen charge, the trial judge instructed the jury to \"make one more effort.\" Thereafter, the jury returned with a verdict. The Court held, even if the jury had twice indicated it was unable to reach a verdict, 5 the statute was not violated because \"[t] here was no insistence here that a verdict could not be agreed on and no objection or complaint ... on the part of the jury as to retiring for further deliberations.\" Id. at 406, S.E. at 310.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Edwards v. Edwards, 239 S.C. 85, 121 S.E.2d 432 (1961), in returning the jury to the jury room to deliberate a third time, the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm going to ask you in all seriousness, Gentlemen, to make one more attempt at this case. When you tell me you can't do it, that's going to be the end of it, because I'm not going to send you back again. So, I'm putting it right straight up to you, see what you can do with it, Gentlemen. Was there any question any of you Gentlemen wanted to ask?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 93, S.E.2d at 436.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining whether the jury was returned with its consent as required by statute, the Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no response or indication of unwillingness on the part of any member of the jury, but on the contrary they returned immediately to the jury room for further deliberation. No verbal acceptance of the request of the trial Judge was made, but consent was implied. Had there been a statement to the effect that further consideration of the case was without their consent, it would have become the duty of the trial Judge to discharge them. However, under the circumstances, if the Judge was satisfied in the exercise of his discretion that the jury consented to return for further deliberation, he should not have dismissed them but permitted further deliberation as was done in the instant case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn other hand, where the trial judge's comments clearly coerce the jury into reaching a verdict, the Court has found a violation of the statute and mistrial the appropriate remedy. Rowland v. Harris, 218 S.C. 42, 61 S.E.2d 397 (1950) (statute violated where trial judge indicated jury would spend weekend injury room until it reached a unanimous verdict); State v. Simon, 126 S.C. 437, 120 S.E. 230 (1923) (statute violated where trial judge notified jury it would spend night injury room unless it reached a unanimous verdict); State v. Kelley, 45 S.C. 659, 24 S.E. 45 (1896) (statute violated where jury deliberated from 4:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m. the next day without lunch, indicated it could not agree, judge instructed jury to retire again, and foreman responded \" [w] e have been in the room for twenty-four hours, and can't agree\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContrary to the holding in Buff, neither the language of Â§14-7-1330 nor our cases applying the statute require the trial judge to inform the jury its consent is necessary before deliberating a third time. We decline to impose such a requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead, we conclude the trial judge who is in the best position to observe the jury's demeanor should have some flexibility in guiding a case to its final resolution while protecting the parties' rights to a fair, impartial, and conscientious verdict. Accordingly, when a jury has twice indicated it is deadlocked, the trial judge should diplomatically discuss with the jury whether further deliberations could be beneficial. The jury's consent to resume or to discontinue deliberations is determined, either expressly or impliedly, by its response to the trial judge's comments. Edwards, 239 S.C. 85, 121 S.E.2d 432 (jury's consent to continue deliberations may be implied from lack of verbal response to request or failure to indicate unwillingness to resume deliberations); Drakeford, 120 S.C. 400, 113 S.E. 307 (consent implied where jury did not insist verdict could not be rendered and jury did not complain about further deliberations); Rowell, 75 S.C. 494, 56 S.E. 23 (consent implied where jury did not indicate it was unwilling to deliberate a third time).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the trial judge properly responded to the jury's second note stating it was deadlocked. The court informed the jury of the desirability of reaching a verdict and advised the jury no other twelve individuals were more capable of deciding the matter, yet reminded the jury no juror should surrender his or her conscientious conviction simply to reach a unanimous verdict. The trial judge's request, \"to try if you can to make one last effort at trying to reach a unanimous verdict, if possible\" and \"both sides would like, if possible, for you to reach a unanimous verdict if you can,\" urged the jury to make one last attempt at reaching a unanimous verdict. 6  It did not require deliberations continue for a certain length of time or imply that the jury must reach a verdict. Although the jury had not previously hesitated tocommunicate with the trial judge, 7 none of the jurors expressed any unwillingness to comply with the trial judge's request. In fact, within the hour, the jury informed the trial judge it was making progress and reached a unanimous verdict. Accordingly, the record indicates the jury consented to a third attempt at deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder all circumstances of this case, we conclude the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by determining the jury consented to return for further deliberation as required by Â§ 14-7-1330. See Edwards, 239 S.C. 85, 121 S.E.2d, Rowell, 75 S.C. 494, 56 S.E. 23, Freely, 105 S.C. 243, 89 S.E. 643. In the future, we suggest the trial judge carefully ensure the existence of a sufficient record from which the appellate court can determine the jury's consent to further deliberations.\r\nAccordingly, we REVERSE the decision of the Court of Appeals and REMAND this matter to the Court of Appeals to rule on DOT's remaining issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate opinion. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In addition, petitioners brought an action against the driver of the other vehicle. \r\n\r\n2 Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896).\r\n\r\n3 Whether the jury had duly and thoroughly deliberated prior to declaring itself deadlocked, as required by &sect; 14-7-1330, is not at issue in this case. \r\n4 The predecessor to &sect; 14-7-1330 has been in existence since at least 1893 and the pertinent language remains the same. 1893 Revised Statutes &sect;2409.\r\n5There was some discussion as to whether the statute applied at all.\r\n\r\n6 When coupled with these phrases, the trial judge's instruction to \"make a continued effort\" did not suggest, as the Court of Appeals held, to continue to deliberate until a verdict is reached, but rather to attempt one final time to reach a unanimous verdict. \r\n7The jury had sent four notes to the trial judge.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal, concurring separately.\r\nWhile I concur with the majority's conclusion that a trial judge does not have to affirmatively inform the jury its consent is necessary before sending it back to deliberate a third time, I write separately to emphasize the importance of \"due deliberation\" in the analysis of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1330 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 14-7-1330 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a jury, after due and thorough deliberation upon any cause, returns into court without having agreed upon a verdict, the court may state anew the evidence or any part of it and explain to it anew the law applicable to the case and may send it out for further deliberation. But if it returns a second time without having agreed upon a verdict, it shall not be sent out again without its own consent unless it shall ask from the court some further explanation of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). This statutory language establishes that due deliberation must occur prior to the jury's claim of deadlock. As the majority points out, the main concern of section 14-7-1330 is the avoidance of forced verdicts and undue severity of jury service. See State v. Freely, 105 S.C. 243, 247, 89 S.E. 643, 644 (1916). As a practical matter, neither of these concerns are relevant until the jury has had the case long enough to qualify as due deliberation. In some cases, a jury may return to the court claiming deadlock well before there has been enough time for due deliberation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, where a complicated trial has occurred over the course of several weeks, if the jury returns claiming deadlock after only a few hours of initial deliberation, the trial judge does not have to count that interruption under section 14-7-1330. If a trial judge had to count every such claim of deadlock as a return, the statute would improperly limit the trial judge's discretion in guiding a case to its final resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe section 14-7-1330 sets up two requirements. First, the section establishes there must be \"due and thorough deliberation\" by the jury before returns to the courtroom may be considered evidence of deadlock. Second, after such due deliberation has occurred, if the jury comes back twice claiming to be deadlocked, the judge must receive the jury's consent before requiring them to deliberate further. As made clear by the majority's opinion, this consent can be either expressed or implied based on the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, J.: I respectfully dissent, and would affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals.\r\nThis case presents for consideration a matter wholly governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1330, the language of which has remained unchanged since at least 1871. 1 Section 14-7-1330 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a jury, after due and thorough deliberation upon any cause, returns into court without having agreed upon a verdict, the court may state anew the evidence or any part of it and explain to it anew the law.applicable to the case and may send it out for further deliberation. But if it returns a second time without having agreed upon a verdict, it shall not be sent out again without its own consent unless it shall ask from the court some further explanation of the law. (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no dispute under the facts of this case but that the jury returned a second time without agreeing upon a verdict. The case thus turns on the question of whether this jury was sent out without its consent since it did not ask for further explanation of the law. Whether the jury has consented is, as found by the majority, a matter for the sound discretion of the trial judge, to be exercised after consideration of the totality of the circumstances. Here, it is my judgment that the trial judge abused his discretion in sending the jury out, following its second return, because they neither verbalized nor manifested by conduct their consent to continued deliberations, as required by the statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree with the majority that a jury's consent may be implied from circumstances. I do not, however, agree that simply because this jury expressed no unwillingness to continue, its consent can be implied. Jurors are told from the beginning of a trial that the trial judge's pronouncements on the law are binding upon them and that their role is to be the sole and exclusive judges of the facts.2 In this case the trial judge instructed the jury to continue its deliberations without in any way seeking to ascertain if they consented. The jury's mere passive acquiescence to this direction was nothing more than an example of the jury appropriately following the charge of the trial judge, and did not, in and of itself, allow an implication of consent. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority, in finding implied consent, relies in part upon the fact that the jury sent a note to the effect that it was making progress after its second return. This note can just as easily be construed as manifesting the jury's reluctance to incur the displeasure of the trial judge as it can as an expression of consent. Again, all that the jury's conduct exhibited was acquiescence to the trial judge's charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I agree with the majority that there are decisions of this Court which seem to support their view, I do not believe that affirmation of the Court of Appeals' decision requires overruling of that precedent. 4  I believe the Court of Appeals has appropriately distinguished Edwards v. Edwards, supra, from the case at bar. In my opinion, the cases relied upon by the majority were each decided upon their unique facts and circumstances which differ markedly from those of this case. Nonetheless, to the extent that Edwards or the other cases cited by the majority may be read to sustain a finding of implied consent solely from the jury's obedience to the judge's instruction to continue its deliberation, I would overrule them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority sets forth in its opinion appropriate guidance to the trial bench for its future dealings with the jury in similar circumstances involving this statute.5I would go further, and require a specific finding by the trial judge setting forth the basis for her conclusion that the jury has consented to continued deliberation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, this is a matter wholly governed by the statute; the statute says what it says, and the exercise of discretion by the trial judge constituted an abuse. I would therefore affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals and would remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 1871 Act No. 419, &sect; 27.\r\n2 They are of course told this by the sole authority figure in the courtroom, the trial judge. \r\n\r\n3 Juries are presumed and bound to follow the instructions of the trial judge.

Bogle, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Respondent was found to have committed several acts of judicial misconduct while serving as the municipal judge for the City of Hanahan. The hearing panel recommended respondent receive a public reprimand. We agree with the findings of the panel and concur in the recommended sanction. Accordingly, we impose a public reprimand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent, a nonlawyer, was first appointed a Berkeley County Magistrate in 1993. He has served continuously since; his current term expires in 2003. From March until December 1997, he also served as a municipal judge in Hanahan. The present charges arose out of his actions as a municipal judge, and involve two defendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. The Chandler Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Chandler was ticketed for careless operation of a motor vehicle in violation of a Hanahan ordinance. Chandler appeared in court on the date specified on the ticket. He testified at the panel hearing that he intended to plead guilty, and had the $140 fine money with him. Pursuant to the well-established procedure followed in the Hanahan Municipal Court, the respondent opened court by inviting all those present who wished to plead guilty to come forward and form a line. When Chandler got to the head of the line, the respondent asked him how he wished to plead. Chandler testified he said \"guilty,\" then started to explain the circumstances surrounding his arrest. The respondent interrupted Chandler and asked him again how he wished to plea, \"and I said guilty and he looked around a little bit and then told me to go ahead and leave.\" The municipal court clerk testified that once Chandler left the courtroom, the respondent turned to her and asked if she knew who Chandler was. When she said no, the respondent told her the defendant was the son of Jeff Chandler, a Hanahan city council member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panel found the respondent directed the clerk to write 'dismissed' on Chandler's ticket, and to stamp it, \"Dismissed on Motion of State.\" Neither the arresting officer (Chanceley), who was not yet present in the courtroom, nor the town prosecutor, was aware of the dismissal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, the respondent testified that Chandler said he wanted to plead guilty, but then started to say more. According to his testimony, the respondent stopped Chandler, looked for Officer Chanceley, and then dismissed the case since he did not see Chanceley in the courtroom. He denied saying anything to the clerk. 1  On cross-examination, the respondent acknowledged he departed from \"standard operating procedure\" in the Chandler case by (1) not telling the defendant to step aside if he was not pleading guilty, and (2) not having someone look for Officer Chanceley before dismissing the charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The Cutrell Matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn David Cutrell (John) was ticketed for driving under the influence (DUI) on August 14, 1997, with the court date set for August 26. Shortly thereafter, John's father (Mr. Cutrell) called a city councilman friend to ask whom Mr. Cutrell could call to ask for a continuance. The city councilman told him to call the respondent. Mr. Cutrell did so, and testified that the respondent suggested that he and John come to the respondent's business office that day. The respondent lectured John, then told Mr. Cutrell he could have a continuance. There is no contention that there was any discussion of the merits of John's case during the meeting. The next day, the respondent called the municipal clerk at work, asked her to hold the ticket out (i.e. continue it past August 26), and to set it for trial before him rather than before the other municipal judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the unchallenged panel findings, when John's case appeared on the September 9 docket, the respondent instructed the clerk to mark it off. After court that day, the clerk asked the respondent what he wanted done with John's DUI charge, and the respondent told her to dismiss it. The respondent had indicated on his copy of the docket that John was `NG', that is, not guilty, and the clerk proceeded to process the ticket as if John had been acquitted after a trial. In mid-October, John appeared before the respondent on a separate shoplifting charge. The arresting officer on the August DUI charge was present, and inquired about disposing of that charge, too. He was told, for the first time, that the DUI charge had been dismissed in September. Subsequently, an Ishmell 2  order was signed October 28, 1997, recalling the DUI ticket. John eventually pleaded guilty to the DUI charge in February 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the shoplifting ticket was called before the respondent on October 14, 1997, John pleaded guilty and was sentenced to thirty days in jail or payment of a $845 fine, plus thirty hours of community service. After court that day, Mr. Cutrell, John, and the respondent met in a conference room at the courthouse. As a result of this private meeting, the respondent altered John's sentence and placed him in an alternative program, with his sentence suspended upon completion of participation in a substance abuse program. Neither the prosecutor nor the arresting officer was told of the meeting, nor of the decision to change the sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panel found the respondent violated these provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1)  Canon l(A), by failing to establish, maintain and enforce high standards of conduct in the two matters at issue;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  Canon 2(A), by failing to respect and comply with the law, and act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)  Canon 2(B), by allowing social or other relationships to influence his conduct or judgment, and by lending the prestige of his judicial office to advance the private interests of another;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)  Canon (3)(B)(5), by failing to perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  Canon 3(B)(7), by initiating, permitting or considering ex parte communications, or considering other communications made to him outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe factual findings in a judicial misconduct action must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. In the Matter of White, 330 S.C. 505, 499 S.E.2d 813 (1998). The findings here are supported by the evidence. While in a disciplinary action the Court is free to find its own facts and draw its own conclusions, In the Matter of Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 510 S.E.2d 804 (1999), we see no basis for departing from the findings and conclusions of the panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has fully acknowledged that his actions in the Chandler and Cutrell matters were wrong, and has expressed remorse. We note that while respondent has served for more than seven years as a member of the unified judicial system, these are the only charges of impropriety made against him, and both occurred shortly after he assumed a new office.

Young, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n        Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary proceeding, the sub-panel and full panel recommend an indefinite suspension. We concur and impose the recommended sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent, Edward S. Ervin, IV, was arrested for 9 counts of obtaining controlled substances by fraud. 1   He was permitted to enter Pre-Trial Intervention (PTI), with the condition he complete 40 hours of community service at the Sumter County Museum. In February, 1999, Ervin submitted a community service work form to the solicitor's office indicating he had completed his 40 hours. Thereafter, the museum employees indicated Ervin had misrepresented the number of hours he had worked on the form. Upon learning of the misrepresentation, the solicitor terminated Ervin from PTI for failing to successfully complete his hours, and for \"Representing False Documentation of Community Service.\" Due to his termination from PTI, Ervin was indicted for 9 counts of obtaining controlled substances by fraud, a felony. 2   He was permitted to plead guilty to 9 counts of obtaining drugs by fraud, deceit or the like, a misdemeanor. 3   He was sentenced to two years, suspended on 6 months probation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the hearing before the sub-panel, respondent did not dispute the fact of his convictions; the only contested issue was whether or not respondent had falsified his PTI hours. Respondent was not present at the sub-panel hearing; Disciplinary Counsel presented testimony of the four Sumter County Museum employees, all to the effect that Ervin misrepresented the number of hours worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sub-panel unanimously recommended imposition of an indefinite suspension, finding Ervin violated Rule 7 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, and the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, due to his convictions for obtaining drugs by fraud. The sub-panel declined to address the issue of whether Ervin had misrepresented the hours worked on his community service form. It found \"the recommended sanction would be the same in any event.\" The full panel adopted the sub-panel's report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, we find clear and convincing evidence from which to conclude Ervin misrepresented the number of hours worked at the Sumter Museum. At the hearing before this Court, respondent acknowledged that the evidence supports a finding that he falsified his PTI hours. Accordingly, we find respondent guilty of misconduct in misrepresenting his hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violation of a Rule of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(4) (conviction of a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime), 4   Rule 7(a)(5) (conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law or bringing the legal profession into dispute), and Rule 7(a)(6) (violation of the oath of office taken upon the admission to practice law in this State). Further, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.4(a) (violated the Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 8.4(b) (commission of a criminal act). We conclude the appropriate sanction in this case is an indefinite suspension from the practice of law. The commencement point for this suspension will be the date respondent was temporarily suspended. Respondent shall file, within fifteen (15) days of this opinion, an affidavit with the clerk of this Court stating he has complied with Paragraph 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Ervin became addicted to Oxcycodone in 1993 after he was prescribed pain medications for a back injury. \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  2 See S.C.

Bogle, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This is a judicial disciplinary matter. Respondent served as a Municipal Court Judge for the town of Sellers and is charged with misconduct. The hearing panel recommended Respondent be publicly reprimanded and enjoined from holding a judicial position in the future. We agree with the findings and recommendation of the Panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has never been licensed to practice law in South Carolina. She is an attorney formerly licensed in California who resigned from the California bar as a result of a disciplinary action. Respondent has failed to respond to these charges. Thus, the Panel held respondent in default . Respondent has not filed anything with this Court since the filing of the formal charges. \r\n\r\n  1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was indicted on May 5, 1999, in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, for among other things, credit card fraud, supplying false tax returns, false employment information, and false social security numbers in applying for a loan, filing false federal income tax returns, mail fraud, and money laundering. The Court placed respondent on interim suspension on June 4, 1999. On September 28, 1999, respondent filed a petition with this Court seeking to lift the interim suspension. In her petition, respondent stated the jury had acquitted her on the federal charges on September 24, 1999. On September 24, 1999, however, respondent had been found guilty of all charges in the indictment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent's convictions of these federal crimes constitute \"serious crimes\" as defined in Rule 2(z), of Rule 502, SCACR, and are crimes of moral turpitude. 2  Thus, respondent's convictions of these federal charges are grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(3), Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR. \r\n\r\n3   Further, under the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, respondent is in default and is deemed to have admitted all allegations in the two complaints served upon her. Rule 24, Rule 502, SCACR; In re Thornton, 327 S.C. 193, 489 S.E.2d 198 (1997). Accordingly, the charges of misconduct against respondent are deemed admitted and we must determine only the appropriate sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude respondent has violated Rule 7(a)(1) and (2) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR, for the California misconduct and failing to respond to the investigation. 4   Further, respondent has violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR (Canons 1, 2, and 4). 5   Respondent no longer holds the position of municipal court judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we publicly reprimand respondent, the maximum sanction we may impose. In addition, respondent shall not seek future appointment to any judicial office within the unified judicial system of South Carolina unless authorized by this Court. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND AND INJUNCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Respondent filed a motion with this Court following her interim suspension. This motion has become a part of the grounds for misconduct currently before us. See further discussion below. \r\n\r\n2 \"Serious crime\" is defined in Rule 2(z) as:\r\nany felony or lesser crime that reflects adversely on the judge's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a judge in other respects, or any crime a necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of the crime, involves interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, isrepresentation, fraud, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, willful failure to file income tax returns, or an attempt, conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a serious crime.\r\n3 Rule 7(a) states, in part: \"It shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to: (3) be convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime. . .\"\r\n4 We note Rule 7(a) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement,  Rule 502, SCACR, provides: \"It shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to: \r\n(1) violate or attempt to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct or the Rules of Professional Conduct or any other applicable ethics codes.\" Thus, respondent's California misconduct is a ground for us to discipline respondent under our rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Canon 1 A states, in part: \"A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved.\" Canon 2 states, in part: \"A judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\" Canon 4 states, in part: \"A judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra judicial activities so that they do not: (1) cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge; (2) demean the judicial office . . . \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25199","title":"In the Matter of Thornton","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25199","description":"","date":"2000-09-25","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Thornton\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of K.

Bentz Kirby, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n        Henry B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension of six months and one day. We accept the agreement. \r\n\r\n1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts in the agreement are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to promptly pay court-related expenses on two occasions. In the first incident, respondent failed to pay a $450 court reporter's fee in a timely fashion. Although the court reporter telephoned respondent's office numerous times after the statement for the fee became past-due, respondent failed to respond. Respondent also failed to respond to telephone calls regarding this fee from the judge presiding over the underlying matter. The court reporter filed a complaint with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct after attempts to reach respondent were unavailing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to pay the court reporter's fee until after he received a Notice of Full Investigation from the ODC. Further, respondent failed to respond to the Commission's requests for a reply in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second matter, respondent failed to pay a $134.15 fee fromanother court reporter in a timely fashion. Respondent promised the court reporter on numerous occasions that payment would be forthcoming. However, respondent failed to make payment until after he received notice of the court reporter's complaint from the ODC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.1(b)(failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a)(violating a Rule of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e)(engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement: Rule 7(a)(1)(violating a Rule of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3)(willfully violating a valid order of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct); and Rule 7(a)(5)(engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice, bringing the legal profession into disrepute, or demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has been disciplined by this Court for similar misconduct on prior occasions. Respondent was issued a Letter of Caution with a finding of minor misconduct in June 1998 for failing to pay a court reporter's fee of $335.31 in a timely fashion. Respondent was also disciplined in December 1998 for failing to pay two court reporters in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of those violations, respondent entered into a Deferred Disciplinary Agreement with the Commission whereby he entered and successfully completed the Law Office Management Program of the South Carolina Bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent's current violations, coupled with his history of prior violations, indicate a disturbing pattern of misconduct with regard to the payment of court reporter fees. Accordingly, we hereby suspend respondent from the practice of law for six months and one day. This suspension shall be retroactive to the date of interim suspension imposed in the income tax matter. Respondent shall neither apply nor be eligible for reinstatement to the practice of law prior to successfully completing the terms of any probation and/or incarceration imposed as a result of the income tax matter. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Respondent recently pled guilty in General Sessions Court to a charge of failing to file a South Carolina income tax return. On February 15, 2000, respondent was placed on interim suspension as a result of this violation. In the Matter of Thornton, 339 S.C. 22, 528 S.E.2d 657 (2000). This Court subsequently imposed a definite suspension for a period of ninety days.
