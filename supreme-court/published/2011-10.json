The Court first held the circuit court did not err in failing to excuse a juror for cause because, when considered as a whole, the voir dire demonstrated the juror could be fair and impartial.  Next, the Court found the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the defenseâ€™s cross-examination of the Stateâ€™s expert under Rule 403, SCRE, because the proffered testimony was misleading and would only serve to confuse the jury.  The Court also held that a defendant is not entitled to a charge on a â€œlesser-relatedâ€ offense, reasoning that a charge on an offense that is not included within the indicted offense diminishes the reliability of the proceedings.  As to the last assignment of error, the Court held the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of the defendantâ€™s cousin as to how his execution would impact their family because it was an opinion of what punishment the jury should recommend.  Finally, the Court found the death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; supported by the evidence; and neither excessive nor disproportionate.","date":"2011-10-03","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        The State, Respondent,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        William O.\r\n          Dickerson, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Charleston County\r\n  R.

Â He argues the circuit\r\n  court erred: (1) in not excusing a juror for cause; (2) in limiting the\r\n  cross-examination of the pathologist called by the State; (3) in not charging\r\n  the jury on the law of accessory after the fact; and (4) in limiting the\r\n  testimony of Dickerson's cousin during the penalty phase of his trial.Â  We\r\n  affirm and further find that Dickerson's sentence is proportional, supported by\r\n  the evidence, and not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\r\n  factor.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nDickerson and\r\n  Gerard Roper had been friends, even best friends, since childhood.Â  On the\r\n  morning of March 6, 2006, Roper went to his friend, Ben Drayton's, house to\r\n  play video games.Â  Around the same time, Dickerson went to his friend, Antonio\r\n  Nelson's, house asking for a ride to his brother, Armon Dickerson's, house.Â \r\n  Nelson was unable to give Dickerson a ride at that time and told him to come\r\n  back later.Â  When Dickerson returned later that afternoon, he was carrying a\r\n  gun.\r\nEn route to\r\n  Armon's house, however, Dickerson began calling Roper from his cell phone.Â \r\n  After receiving no answer, Dickerson asked if they could make a stop at\r\n  Drayton's house so he could &quot;get some money.&quot;Â  When they arrived at\r\n  Drayton's home, Dickerson entered brandishing his weapon and asking for money.Â \r\n  Roper told Dickerson &quot;I got your money,&quot; begging &quot;don't shoot\r\n  me&quot; and &quot;please don't kill me.&quot;Â  Dickerson nevertheless fired a\r\n  shot at Roper but missed.Â  He then struck Roper in the head with the gun,\r\n  dragged him out of the house, and forced him into Nelson's car.Â  Dickerson then\r\n  took Roper to Armon's house.[1]Â  \r\nArmon and\r\n  Dickerson brought Roper inside and systematically tortured him over\r\n  approximately thirty-six hours.Â  It started with Dickerson continuing to hit\r\n  Roper with the gun, knocking out some of his teeth.Â  Armon then left to\r\n  retrieve Dickerson's car and some drugs, and blood covered the inside of the\r\n  house when he returned. Â Dickerson then called another friend of his, Rashid\r\n  Malik, and threatened him with death if he did not come to Armon's house.[2]Â  When Malik arrived, Roper was still\r\n  conscious but clothed only in his T-shirt, and Armon was attempting to clean up\r\n  the blood covering the house.Â  Malik then joined Armon and Dickerson.\r\nAlthough\r\n  Dickerson, Armon, and Malik all tortured Roper to varying degrees, Dickerson\r\n  appeared to be the primary actor.[3]Â \r\n  Through this entire ordeal, Roper suffered the following at the hands of\r\n  Dickerson alone: choking, being tied up and placed in a closet, being sodomized\r\n  with a gun and a broomstick, having his scrotum burned, being hit with a heavy\r\n  vase and a mirror, and generalized beating and cutting.Â  At one point, Roper began\r\n  asking that they just let him die.\r\nAll told, Roper\r\n  received over 200 individual wounds to the outside of his body, including\r\n  lacerations to his anus.Â  He also received several internal injuries, including\r\n  various broken bones in his face that caused it to appear misshapen, blunt\r\n  force trauma to his neck resulting in the breaking of various structures, a\r\n  broken tibia, broken fingers and wrist, brain swelling, and bleeding into the\r\n  internal structures around his rectum as the result of objects being inserted\r\n  into it.Â  Although there is no definite timeline of events, Roper survived for\r\n  eighteen to twenty-four hours after the sodomy occurred, and none of these\r\n  wounds were inflicted post-mortem.Â  No single wound was fatal.Â  Instead, Roper\r\n  died from the sum total of his injuries, apparently shortly after he was struck\r\n  with the mirror and the vase on the morning of March 8.\r\nAs these events\r\n  transpired, Dickerson made several phone calls to various people during which\r\n  he discussed what he was doing to Roper.Â  Many of them were to Dickerson's girlfriend,\r\n  and she managed to record one of them containing his description of the sodomy\r\n  and even Roper's own confirmation of what was happening.Â  Dickerson also\r\n  confirmed the sodomy, as well as the burning of Roper's scrotum, over the phone\r\n  to another friend.Â  In a later call to that same friend, he said that Roper was\r\n  &quot;gone.&quot;Â  However, he told a different friend that Roper was all right\r\n  but that Dickerson needed to run.\r\nDickerson and\r\n  Armon wrapped Roper's semi-clothed body in a blanket and dumped it in the\r\n  vacant townhouse next to Armon's.Â  Dickerson then changed clothes and fled.Â \r\n  Armon and Rouse attempted to clean Armon's house, but they abandoned it upon\r\n  realizing their efforts would be futile.Â  That same day, a woman who was planning\r\n  to rent the vacant townhouse entered and discovered Roper's bloodied and\r\n  mutilated body.Â  \r\nDickerson was arrested\r\n  on March 11, 2006, and indicted for murder, kidnapping, and criminal sexual\r\n  conduct.Â  During voir dire, Juror 370 was the second venireman to be called.Â \r\n  He initially identified himself as the type of juror who was able to recommend\r\n  a sentence of death or life without parole in the appropriate circumstances.Â \r\n  The following exchanges then occurred between Juror 370 and the circuit judge:\r\n\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  I would also instruct you that the only party\r\n    which has any burden of proof in this proceeding is the State.Â  Mr. Dickerson\r\n    doesn't have to prove anything, he doesn't have to -- he doesn't have to\r\n    present any evidence, he has no obligation whatsoever.Â  Would you have any\r\n    problem following that presumption?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  No sir.\r\n  . . . . \r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  . . . I would tell you that if the jury were\r\n    to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that there were aggravating\r\n    circumstances, that does not mean that that jury has to return a death\r\n    sentence, only that it is a potential sentence; do you understand that?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Because the jury would have the right,\r\n    notwithstanding the conclusion of aggravating circumstances to find that the\r\n    appropriate sentence would be life imprisonment without the possibility of\r\n    parole.Â  I would give you an instruction as to that.Â  You could make that\r\n    consideration, as well; is that correct?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  When\r\n    questioned by Dickerson, Juror 370 made the following statements:\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Let me just kind of start off with, what is\r\n    your opinion of the death penalty?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  I am -- I think it needs to be there but there\r\n    are certain situations that -- I mean, I am not too up-to-date on this whole\r\n    system but I feel like a lot of people get the death penalty when it is not\r\n    deserved.Â  People die all the time, I mean get put to death, when they're\r\n    innocent.Â  So -- I don't know.Â  It's a big thing.\r\n  . . . . \r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  In those types of situations, now that you\r\n    know what the term &quot;murder&quot; is, not accident, self-defense,\r\n    manslaughter or insanity, would you always automatically vote for [the death\r\n    penalty] if the person who did it meant to do it and they had the right person?\r\n  . . . .\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  I would still have to hear all of the\r\n    evidence, everything behind it.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  When, how, where, all that stuff.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  So even if there is no accident, self-defense,\r\n    manslaughter, insanity, the State has proved it beyond a reasonable doubt, did\r\n    it, meant to do it and they had the right person; in those cases you're not\r\n    going to automatically vote for the death penalty?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  I guess -- I guess I would.Â  If it was\r\n    absolute, then definitely.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  When you say &quot;absolutely&quot;, you mean\r\n    ---\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Exactly what you just said, all those.\r\n\r\nHowever, in response to\r\n  further questioning by Dickerson, Juror 370 stated, &quot;That's why -- all\r\n  those situations, like who he is, like -- that kinds of stuff is what I'd want\r\n  to hear before I just say 'give them the death penalty.'&quot; Â He then\r\n  said he would &quot;certainly&quot; listen to mitigating evidence presented by\r\n  the defense.\r\nBefore turning Juror 370 over\r\n  to the State, Dickerson pressed the juror on his belief regarding the\r\n  defendant's burden of proof during the sentencing phase of a capital trial:\r\n\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  . . . [W]ould you expect the defendant or his\r\n    attorney to present something to you to give you a reason not to vote for\r\n    death?Â  To kind of convince you, 'Okay, I found him guilty of murder, I've\r\n    heard all this other stuff but I[']m for death.'Â  Would you expect the defense\r\n    to show, 'you need to show me stuff that would convince me otherwise, to vote\r\n    for life'?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  (No verbal response).\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Is that what you're telling me?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  I -- yeah, isn't that what you've got to do?\r\n  . . . .\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  And all that bad stuff in there and they just\r\n    argue for mercy, that is not something that is going to persuade you?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  No.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  So you would be looking at the defense to kind\r\n    of convince you that a death penalty wasn't the right sentence?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah.Â  Just to represent him, show something\r\n    -- I mean, something had to happen.\r\n  During rehabilitation, the\r\n    State informed Juror 370 that the judge would in fact instruct him that it was\r\n    improper to hold a defendant's decision to not present any evidence against\r\n    him.Â  The following exchange then occurred:\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Because just a minute ago you were saying that\r\n    you would expect the defendant to put something up.\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Well, I mean -- I thought that was kind of how\r\n    it worked.Â  But if -- (pause).\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Well, the Judge would tell you that it works\r\n    differently and ---\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  If he told me that, yeah, then I wouldn't\r\n    expect it.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  You wouldn't consider that, the fact that he\r\n    didn't put anything up -- any evidence?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  So you could follow the Judge's instructions?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, ma'am.\r\n\r\nThe State then confirmed that\r\n  Juror 370 would in fact be able to consider a sentence of life without parole\r\n  even if the State proved aggravating circumstances.\r\nDuring follow-up questioning\r\n  by the court, the circuit judge repeated the State's question of whether Juror\r\n  370 would have any trouble abiding by the court's instruction that Dickerson\r\n  would have nothing to prove, to which Juror 370 reiterated that he would not.\r\n  However, Dickerson again asked whether Juror 370 would look to Dickerson to\r\n  prove why the death penalty was not appropriate, to which Juror 370 said\r\n  &quot;yes,&quot; but Juror 370 then told the State once again that he would\r\n  follow whatever the judge instructed him.Â  Dickerson then moved to have Juror\r\n  370 disqualified because he was a &quot;burden shifter&quot; who would require\r\n  the defense to prove that death should not be imposed.Â  The court disagreed,\r\n  finding Juror 370's statements that he would follow the law as instructed and\r\n  he would want to hear all of the circumstances demonstrated he was not a burden\r\n  shifter.\r\nDuring the guilt phase, one\r\n  of the many witnesses called by the State was Dr. Cynthia Schandl, the\r\n  pathologist who performed Roper's autopsy.Â  On direct examination, she\r\n  testified that the blood toxicology report on Roper was negative, which\r\n  demonstrated he did not have any drugs in his system when he died.Â  On cross\r\n  examination, Dickerson attempted to inquire about an initial urine screen test\r\n  performed by Dr. Shandl that would show whether there were drugs present in\r\n  Roper's system up to two days prior to his death.Â  The State objected under\r\n  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  In her proffer, Dr. Shandl testified that this test was\r\n  &quot;presumptively positive&quot; for cocaine metabolites, but Dr. Schandl\r\n  never ordered confirmatory testing.Â  According to her, these initial screening\r\n  tests produce a large number of false positives and are very unreliable absent\r\n  any sort of confirmation.Â  Dickerson, however, argued the State's question\r\n  about the blood toxicology results opened the door for this line of questioning\r\n  as it left the jury with the misleading impression that Roper had not used\r\n  cocaine.Â  Finding the proffered testimony itself was actually misleading, the\r\n  possibility of prejudice from excluding it was remote, it did not challenge any\r\n  of Dr. Schandl's findings, and it would only serve to confuse the jury, the\r\n  court refused to permit this line of questioning.\r\nAt the close of evidence,\r\n  Dickerson requested the jury be charged on the law of accessory after the\r\n  fact.Â  The court, however, denied this request because accessory after the fact\r\n  is not a lesser-included offense of murder.Â  The jury subsequently convicted\r\n  Dickerson on all charges.Â  In the sentencing phase, the State proceeded under\r\n  three aggravating factors: criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, and torture,\r\n  also highlighting Dickerson's prior criminal history and adaptability to prison\r\n  life.Â  Dr. Shandl testified again during the sentencing phase, repeating much of\r\n  her testimony from the guilt phase.Â  In particular, she emphasized that none of\r\n  Roper's wounds were inflicted post-mortem, and he died from the totality of his\r\n  injuries rather than from any single blow.\r\nIn mitigation, Dickerson called\r\n  several witnesses from the Charleston County Detention Center, where he was\r\n  being held pending trial, who testified he was a model prisoner.Â  He also\r\n  called several witnesses who testified extensively regarding his drug use,\r\n  childhood trauma, and mental problems.Â  These witnesses further opined that he\r\n  suffered from cocaine psychosis and attendant paranoia.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Dickerson's cousin, Johnette Watson, testified on his behalf.Â  She stated he\r\n  had always been like a brother to her, a good person who just got mixed up in\r\n  the wrong things and with the wrong people.Â  However, the court did not permit\r\n  her to testify as to what impact his execution would have on her family,\r\n  chiefly that her family would be devastated as it had already lost two close members\r\n  to homicide.\r\nUltimately, the jury\r\n  recommended the court impose a sentence of death, finding the State proved all\r\n  three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  The court followed\r\n  the jury's recommendation.Â  This appeal followed pursuant to section 16-3-25.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\nDickerson raises four issues\r\n  on appeal:\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in\r\n    qualifying Juror 370?\r\n  II.&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in not\r\n    permitting Dickerson to cross examine Dr. Schandl regarding the urinalysis\r\n    screen results?\r\n  III. Did the circuit court err in not\r\n    charging the jury on the law of accessory after the fact?\r\n  IV. Did the circuit court err in not\r\n    permitting Watson to testify regarding the impact Dickerson's potential\r\n    execution would have on her family?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; JUROR QUALIFICATION\r\nDickerson first argues the\r\n  court erred when it found Juror 370 qualified to serve on the panel because he\r\n  was a burden shifter, meaning he improperly placed the burden on the defense to\r\n  show why death would not be an appropriate punishment.Â  We disagree.\r\nA juror must be excused from\r\n  service if &quot;the juror's views would 'prevent or substantially impair the\r\n  performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and\r\n  his oath.'&quot; Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424 (1985) (quoting Adams\r\n    v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38, 45 (1980)); see also State v. Green, 301 S.C.\r\n  347, 354, 392 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1990).\r\n\r\n  A juror\r\n    who will automatically vote for the death penalty in every case will fail in\r\n    good faith to consider the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\r\n    as the instructions require him to do. . . .Â  If even one such juror is empaneled\r\n    and the death sentence is imposed, the state is disentitled to execute the\r\n    sentence.\r\n\r\nMorgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 729 (1992).Â  General protestations\r\n  that the juror will follow the law, without the opportunity for further inquiry\r\n  by the defendant, are not sufficient for &quot;[i]t may be that a juror could,\r\n  in good conscience, swear to uphold the law and yet be unaware that maintaining\r\n  such dogmatic beliefs about the death penalty would prevent him or her from\r\n  doing so.&quot; Id. at 734-36; see also State v. Bennett, 328\r\n  S.C. 251, 257-58, 493 S.E.2d 845, 848 (1997) (holding that a juror's general\r\n  statements he could be fair and impartial and follow the law were not sufficient\r\n  in light of his later, unequivocal statement that he would just &quot;go with\r\n  the majority&quot;).\r\nThis inquiry, however,\r\n  &quot;cannot be reduced to question-and-answer sessions which obtain results in\r\n  the manner of a catechism.&quot; Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424.Â  Thus, the\r\n  record may not be entirely clear to the point of &quot;unmistakable clarity&quot;\r\n  as to the juror's views, and situations will arise where a circuit court simply\r\n  is left with a &quot;definite impression&quot; of a juror's qualifications\r\n  following voir dire. Id. at 425-26.Â  &quot;[T]his is why deference must\r\n  be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.&quot; Id. at\r\n  426.Â  Therefore, determinations of whether a juror is qualified to serve on a\r\n  panel are left to the sole discretion of the circuit court. Green, 301\r\n  S.C. at 354, 392 S.E.2d at 160.Â  In reviewing the circuit court's decision, we\r\n  must examine the juror's responses in light of the entire voir dire and will\r\n  not reverse the court's decision unless it is wholly unsupported by the\r\n  evidence. Id. at 354, 392 S.E.2d at 160-61.\r\nAlthough Juror 370\r\n  unquestionably displayed some equivocation on how he might vote should the\r\n  State prove an aggravating circumstance, the State's rehabilitation revealed this\r\n  was more the result of a misunderstanding of the trial process than any firmly\r\n  held belief that he would automatically vote for the death penalty.Â  For\r\n  example, after stating that he would expect the defense to put forth evidence\r\n  in mitigation, Juror 370 stated, &quot;isn't that what you've got to do&quot;\r\n  and &quot;I thought that was kind of how it worked.&quot;Â  He went on to state,\r\n  however, if the court instructed him that the defense bore no burden, he\r\n  &quot;wouldn't expect it.&quot;Â  He also stated he &quot;would have to hear all\r\n  of the evidence&quot; before he would say &quot;give them the death\r\n  penalty.&quot;Â  Although similar exchanges occurred throughout the voir dire,\r\n  the one thing he was unequivocal about was that he would follow the law as it\r\n  was instructed to him by the court.Â  Consistent with Morgan, Dickerson\r\n  was allowed to probe the true nature of Juror 370's beliefs, and that\r\n  examination produced nothing resembling either a deep-seeded preference for the\r\n  death penalty or a true belief Dickerson must prove that death is not\r\n  appropriate.Â  \r\nAfter a review of the entire\r\n  voir dire, the salient portions of which are reproduced above, this in-depth\r\n  examination produced evidence to support the court's ruling that Juror 370\r\n  could be a fair and impartial juror, acting in accordance with the court's\r\n  instructions and not merely blindly professing that he would do so. Â The\r\n  circuit judge was more persuaded by the juror's consistent affirmation he would\r\n  follow the law and wait to hear all of the evidence than by his apparent\r\n  confusion over the State's burden, and we believe his ultimate determination of\r\n  Juror 370's qualification to serve is supported by the record.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; CROSS EXAMINATION OF DR.\r\n  SCHANDL\r\nNext, Dickerson argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in preventing him from asking Dr. Schandl about the urine\r\n  screen test she performed on Roper in conjunction with the autopsy.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;Although relevant,\r\n  evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\r\n  jury, or by consideration of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\r\n  presentation of cumulative evidence.&quot; Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The admission of\r\n  evidence is within the circuit court's discretion and will not be reversed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. State v. Gaster, 349 S.C.\r\n  545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).\r\nOn direct examination, Dr.\r\n  Schandl testified that Roper's blood toxicology report was negative, meaning\r\n  there were no drugs in his system when he died.Â  On cross examination,\r\n  Dickerson attempted to elicit the results of a preliminary urinalysis test that\r\n  would show whether Roper used cocaine within two days prior to his death.Â  In\r\n  her proffer in response to the State's objection under Rule 403, SCRE, Dr.\r\n  Schandl stated that while the urine screen test performed was\r\n  &quot;presumptively positive,&quot; that test alone is unreliable and no\r\n  confirmatory testing was done.Â  The circuit court refused to admit this\r\n  evidence, agreeing this form of testing was inherently unreliable and therefore\r\n  would be misleading, would confuse the jury, and actually did not challenge any\r\n  of Dr. Schandl's conclusions.Â  We agree.\r\nThe relevance of whether the victim had used cocaine within the two days prior to his death is dubious, at best,\r\n  under the facts of this case.Â  Dickerson calls this presumptive test &quot;an\r\n  inconvenient truth for the [S]tate,&quot; but we fail to see in what way it is\r\n  inconvenient; it does not challenge any of Dr. Schandl's findings regarding\r\n  Roper's cause of death and would only have injected irrelevant considerations\r\n  into the trial.Â  Therefore, there is little, if any, probative value to this\r\n  evidence, and it would only serve to confuse the jury and distract it from the\r\n  case at hand.\r\nDickerson turns to Rule\r\n  608(c), SCRE, to supply the requisite relevance and probative value, arguing\r\n  this testimony demonstrates Dr. Schandl's bias, prejudice, or motive to lie.Â  &quot;[A]nything having a legitimate tendency to\r\n  throw light on the accuracy, truthfulness, and sincerity of a witness may be\r\n  shown and considered in determining the credit to be accorded his testimony.Â \r\n  On cross-examination, any fact may be elicited which tends to show\r\n  interest, bias, or partiality of the witness.&quot; State v. Saltz, 346\r\n  S.C. 114, 131-32, 551 S.E.2d 240, 250 (2001) (quotations omitted).Â  Â Â However,\r\n  the proffered cross examination did not elicit a single fact that might shed\r\n  any light on a potential motive or bias for Dr. Schandl to misrepresent.Â \r\n  Although Dickerson is correct that Dr. Schandl was the key witness for the\r\n  State regarding cause of death and torture, that fact alone certainly does not establish\r\n  a reason for her to lie, and the proffered testimony does not complete the\r\n  circle.\r\nSimilarly, we reject\r\n  Dickerson's argument that the evidence must be available to rebut the\r\n  &quot;false impression&quot; created by the State when Dr. Schandl testified\r\n  that Roper's blood toxicology report was negative.Â  A defendant generally is\r\n  entitled to rebut false impressions created by the State's evidence. See\r\n    State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 221, 641 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2007).Â  Dickerson\r\n  argues the false impression he is entitled to rebut is that Roper did not use\r\n  cocaine.Â  Even assuming Dr. Schandl's testimony did create this impression,\r\n  Roper's drug use is irrelevant in this case. Â Therefore, this plainly is not a\r\n  situation where the false impression created is at all prejudicial to the\r\n  defendant.Â  Permitting Dickerson to respond would only take her testimony\r\n  further down that rabbit hole.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold the\r\n  circuit court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence.[4]\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT\r\nDickerson next argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in failing to charge the jury on the law of accessory after\r\n  the fact.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn a capital case, a\r\n  defendant is entitled to a charge on any lesser-included offenses of murder when\r\n  supported by the evidence. See Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 635-38\r\n  (1980).Â  A lesser-included offense is one whose elements are wholly contained\r\n  within the crime charged. Northcutt, 372 S.C. at 215, 641 S.E.2d at\r\n  877.Â  Stated differently, if the offense contains any elements that are not\r\n  part of the crime charged, then it is not a lesser-included offense. Id.Â \r\n  However, even if an offense does not meet the elements test, it will be\r\n  considered a lesser-included offense if it &quot;has traditionally been considered\r\n  a lesser included offense of the greater offense charged.&quot; Id. at\r\n  216, 641 S.E.2d at 877-78.Â  The Supreme Court of the United States stated the\r\n  rationale for requiring charges on lesser-included offenses as follows:\r\n\r\n  For when\r\n    the evidence unquestionably establishes that the defendant is guilty of a\r\n    serious, violent offenseâ€”but leaves some doubt with respect to an element that\r\n    would justify conviction of a capital offenseâ€”the failure to give the jury the\r\n    &quot;third option&quot; of convicting on a lesser included offense would seem\r\n    inevitably to enhance the risk of an unwarranted conviction.\r\n\r\nBeck, 447 U.S. at 637.Â  A court must therefore charge on\r\n  lesser-included offenses that are supported by the evidence in order to enhance\r\n  the reliability of guilt determinations. Id. at 638.\r\nIt is well-settled that accessory\r\n  after the fact is not a lesser-included offense of murder in this State.[5] State v. Fuller, 346 S.C. 477, 481, 552 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001).Â \r\n  Therefore, Beck standing alone does not require a court to charge the\r\n  jury on accessory after the fact.Â  Dickerson, however, argues that accessory\r\n  after the fact is a &quot;lesser-related offense&quot; of murder and Beck,\r\n  when combined with our decision in State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 494 (2005), mandates a charge on it when requested.\r\nIn Gentry, we held\r\n  that the concepts of subject matter jurisdiction and sufficiency of an\r\n  indictment are distinct. 363 S.C. at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499.Â  A court therefore\r\n  has subject matter jurisdiction to hear cases even if the indictment fails to\r\n  allege all the elements of the offense. See id.Â  Accordingly, if the\r\n  defendant fails to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment prior to the\r\n  jury being sworn, he waives that challenge. Id. at 102, 610\r\n  S.E.2d at 500.Â  \r\nDickerson extrapolates from\r\n  this the ability to charge a lesser-related offense because the court would\r\n  still have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim, and it is therefore\r\n  inconsequential that he was not indicted as an accessory.Â  Thus, a defendant\r\n  should be able to request a charge on any related offense supported by the\r\n  evidence, regardless of whether it is included within the ones for which he was\r\n  indicted.[6]Â \r\n  We do not read Gentry so broadly.Â  While the circuit court may have had\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to try Dickerson as an accessory after the fact, Gentry merely held that a defendant must challenge an indictment prior to the swearing\r\n  of the jury.Â  Because the sufficiency of the indictment is not at issue here, Gentry is inapposite.\r\nThe Supreme Court of the\r\n  United States has held that, unlike lesser-included offenses under Beck,\r\n  there is no constitutional requirement to charge a jury on lesser-related\r\n  offenses. Hopkins v. Reeves, 524 U.S. 88, 90-91 (1998); see also\r\n    People v. Birks, 960 P.2d 1073, 1087-88 (Cal. 1998) (finding the analysis\r\n  in Reeves &quot;utterly convincing&quot; and rejecting a charge on\r\n  lesser-related offenses).Â  Such a requirement would be\r\n  &quot;unprecedented&quot; and &quot;unworkable&quot; because there would be no\r\n  real basis for determining when such charges would be warranted. Hopkins,\r\n  524 U.S. at 97.Â  Furthermore, charging on lesser-related offenses, which by\r\n  their nature generally contain elements that are not included within the crimes\r\n  for which the defendant was charged and tried, would permit the jury &quot;to\r\n  find beyond a reasonable doubt elements that the State had not attempted to\r\n  prove, and indeed that it had ignored during the course of the trial.Â  This can\r\n  hardly be said to be a reliable result.&quot; Id. at 99.\r\nWe agree with the Supreme\r\n  Court's reasoning in Hopkins that permitting such a charge does not\r\n  further the policy behind charging lesser-included offenses.Â  The core of Beck's\r\n  requirement was to ensure reliability in the proceedings by giving the jury a\r\n  third option beyond acquittal or conviction so that its verdict will better\r\n  conform to the evidence presented.Â  The Hopkins Court, on the other\r\n  hand, believed that charging on lesser-related offenses would diminish the\r\n  proceeding's reliability by permitting the jury to convict the defendant of a\r\n  crime the State never even sought to prove at trial.\r\nTherefore, we adopt the\r\n  Supreme Court's holding in Hopkins and hold that a defendant is not\r\n  entitled to a charge on lesser-related offenses.Â  Here, permitting the jury to\r\n  convict Dickerson as an accessory after the fact would permit the jury to find\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt elements of a crime the State never sought to prove\r\n  and Dickerson was not on notice he had to defend against.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  affirm the circuit court's denial of Dickerson's request to charge.\r\nIV.&nbsp; EXECUTION IMPACT EVIDENCE\r\nFinally, Dickerson argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in preventing his cousin, Johnette Watson, from testifying\r\n  as to what effects Dickerson's execution would have on her family.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nDuring the sentencing phase\r\n  of a capital trial, the defense must be able to present mitigating evidence on\r\n  &quot;any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the\r\n  circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a\r\n  sentence less than death.&quot; Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110\r\n  (1982) (quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality)); Northcutt,\r\n  372 S.C. at 221, 641 S.E.2d at 880.Â  The jury is entitled to hear this evidence\r\n  so that it may &quot;give a 'reasoned moral response to the defendant's\r\n  background, character, and crime'&quot; and prevent it from reacting out of an\r\n  &quot;unguided emotional response.&quot; Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302,\r\n  328 (1989) (quoting Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U.S. 164, 184 (O'Connor,\r\n  J., concurring)), abrogated on other grounds by Atkins v. Virginia, 536\r\n  U.S. 304 (1989).Â  However, Eddings does not limit a court's ability to\r\n  exclude evidence not bearing on the defendant's character, his prior record, or\r\n  the circumstances of the crime as being irrelevant. 438 U.S. at 604 n.12.Â  \r\nFor example, &quot;[a]\r\n  capital defendant is prohibited from directly eliciting the opinion of family\r\n  members or other penalty-phase witnesses about the appropriate penalty.Â  Such\r\n  questions go to the ultimate issue to be decided by the juryâ€”life in prison\r\n  versus the death penaltyâ€”and are properly reserved for determination by the\r\n  jury.&quot; State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 27, 596 S.E.2d 475, 481 (2004).Â \r\n  A capital defendant also cannot present witnesses who will testify as to what punishment\r\n  the jury &quot;ought&quot; to recommend. Id.Â  However, defense witnesses\r\n  who know the defendant well can beg for mercy on his behalf. Id.Â  Whether\r\n  certain evidence is a plea for mercy versus an opinion of what is the\r\n  appropriate penalty can be a close call and thus is left to the discretion of\r\n  the trial judge; that decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Id. at 21, 596 S.E.2d at 478.\r\nThe thrust of Dickerson's\r\n  argument is that the emotional impact an execution would have on his family\r\n  members demonstrates that he has the ability to form cohesive, lasting\r\n  relationships with others, a trait that reflects positively on his character.Â  We\r\n  agree that evidence of a defendant's ability to form positive relationships\r\n  with others is evidence that Eddings renders admissible.Â  And here,\r\n  Watson testified without objection to the close bond she shared with Dickerson\r\n  and how he was like a brother to her.Â  However, execution impact evidence can\r\n  easily cross the line from illuminating a defendant's character or a plea for\r\n  mercy to an opinion of what is the proper punishment.Â  \r\nHad the court permitted\r\n  Watson to testify as planned, she would have testified her family lost two\r\n  members to homicide: her brother as well as another cousin of Dickerson's.Â \r\n  Dickerson's execution would therefore exacerbate the suffering her family has\r\n  already endured.Â  This evidence no longer concerns Dickerson's character but\r\n  rather borders on an opinion that Dickerson should not be executed in order to\r\n  spare her family the suffering.Â  Watson's proferred testimony thus strayed from\r\n  relevant considerations into the realm of an opinion regarding which punishment\r\n  the jury ought to recommend.Â  Under our standard of review, we find the circuit\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the State's objection in this\r\n  case.[7]\r\nV. PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nPursuant to section 16-3-25(C),\r\n  we must conduct a review of Dickerson's sentence.Â  In doing so, we must\r\n  determine whether the sentence was the result of passion, prejudice, or any\r\n  other arbitrary factor; whether there is evidence to support the jury's\r\n  findings; and whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the\r\n  sentences imposed in similar cases. See id.\r\nFirst, we cannot find anything\r\n  demonstrating that the sentence was the result of passion, prejudice, or any\r\n  other arbitrary factor.Â  Although Dickerson's attorneys did a commendable job\r\n  representing him during both phases of trial, the gruesome nature of\r\n  Dickerson's acts fits squarely within the aggravating circumstances for which\r\n  the jury recommended the death penalty.Â  Furthermore, there is no indication\r\n  that the proceedings were tainted in any way or that the sentence was anything\r\n  other than a rational response to the evidence presented.\r\nSecond, and similarly, we\r\n  hold evidence exists to support the jury's finding that the State met its\r\n  burden with respect to all three aggravating circumstances.Â  The record readily\r\n  demonstrates Dickerson kidnapped Roper, committed criminal sexual conduct on\r\n  him, and tortured him.Â  Indeed, the jury separately convicted Dickerson of\r\n  kidnapping and criminal sexual conduct during the guilt phase of the trial.Â  We\r\n  can find nothing reflecting an absence of proof as to any of these aggravating\r\n  factors.\r\nFinally, we believe\r\n  Dickerson's sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate in light of the\r\n  results in similar cases.Â  In capital cases where the State proceeded on the\r\n  aggravating circumstances of kidnapping, criminal sexual conduct, torture, or\r\n  any combination thereof, this Court has routinely affirmed the sentence of\r\n  death. See State v. Stanko, 376 S.C. 571, 573, 579, 658 S.E.2d 94, 95, 98 (2008)\r\n  (affirming death penalty where defendant strangled girlfriend and attempted to\r\n  murder her daughter during the course of a robbery and sexual assault); State v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 410-11, 422, 645 S.E.2d 904, 907, 913 (2007)\r\n  (affirming death sentence where defendant kidnapped victim, sexually assaulted\r\n  her, and stabbed her twelve times); State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 37,\r\n  46, 599 S.E.2d 448, 449-50, 454 (2004) (affirming death sentence where\r\n  defendant robbed the victim, beat her with a stick, strangled her, and sexually\r\n  assaulted her while she was &quot;half and half&quot; alive); State v.\r\n    Stokes, 345 S.C. 368, 371, 377, 548 S.E.2d 202, 203, 206-07 (2001)\r\n  (affirming death sentence where the defendant had sex with the victim, stabbed\r\n  her, continued to have sex with her, shot her in the head, and then mutilated\r\n  her body); State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 120-21, 130, 525 S.E.2d 519,\r\n  521-22, 527 (2000) (affirming death sentence where the defendant robbed the\r\n  victim at knifepoint, kidnapped her, tied the victim up, and sliced her\r\n  multiple times with a machete); State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 46, 54,\r\n  476 S.E.2d 683, 685, 689 (1996) (affirming death sentence where defendant\r\n  stabbed victim multiple times, beat her with a lamp and an iron, strangled her\r\n  with a lamp cord, stuck a dish towel in her mouth, and sexually assaulted her).[8]\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find that the death penalty was warranted in this case.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm Dickerson's conviction for murder and the circuit court's sentence of\r\n  death.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a\r\n  separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the decision to affirm this capital\r\n  appeal and sentence, but write separately to address both the lesser-included\r\n  issue and the majority's suggestion in footnote 8 that we should consider\r\n  altering our approach to proportionality review.\r\nI agree with the majority\r\n  that appellant has no constitutional right to a charge on a lesser-related\r\n  offense.Â  Hopkins v. Reeves, 524 U.S. 88 (1998).Â  Rather, the question\r\n  of a defendant's right to such a charge is a matter of state law.Â  Id.; see\r\n    e.g., Sheffield v. State, 64 So.3d 529 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).Â  In my\r\n  opinion, State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005),\r\n  fundamentally altered state law by converting an indictment, which theretofore\r\n  had been a jurisdictional document, into a mere notice document.Â  Id. at\r\n  102-103, 610 S.E.2d at 500.Â  Since the notice is directed only to the\r\n  defendant, in my opinion, it is within his sole prerogative to waive such\r\n  notice.\r\nUnlike the majority, I find\r\n  nothing in People v. Birks, 960 P.2d 1073 (Cal. 1998) which conflicts\r\n  with my view that a court may authorize a criminal defendant to request\r\n  a jury charge on a lesser-related offense.Â  In Birks, the California\r\n  Supreme Court held it had created a state constitutional problem by extending\r\n  to the defendant alone the right to request such a charge on state due process\r\n  grounds, and reversed its earlier decision.Â  If the Court agrees with Birks that it is a constitutional violation to give only one party in a criminal\r\n  proceeding the right to request such a charge, then the problem can be remedied\r\n  by overruling Gentry.Â  \r\nOn the merits, I find no\r\n  reversible error in the circuit court's decision not to charge the jury on the\r\n  lesser-related offense of accessory after the fact because such a charge was\r\n  not supported by the evidence.Â  See State v. Collins, 329 S.C.\r\n  23, 495 S.E.2d 202 (1998) (elements of accessory after the fact explained).\r\nI believe that when S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(3) (2003) requires us to determine whether the death sentence\r\n  &quot;is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\r\n  considering both the crime and the defendant,&quot; and to refer to the similar\r\n  cases that we considered, we should confine our review to only those cases in\r\n  which a death sentence was imposed. [9]State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982)(only review of\r\n  appeals where death sentence was imposed satisfies both state statute and\r\n  constitution). As Copeland explains, to include in our review cases\r\n  where a capital sentence was sought but not imposed requires us to speculate\r\n  on, among other things, the solicitor's decision-making process, the\r\n  strength of the State's case, and/or upon the jurors' or trial judge's decision\r\n  to exercise mercy.Â  Moreover, our reference for proportionality extends only to\r\n  cases which are appealed, and thus is not truly representative of all cases\r\n  where the death penalty was or could have been sought.Â  Experience teaches that\r\n  many of these cases where a lesser sentence is imposed are never appealed.Â  \r\nOn the merits, I agree that the\r\n  death sentence imposed upon appellant is not disproportionate.\r\nFor the reasons given above,\r\n  I concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] After dropping Dickerson and Roper off, Nelson left\r\n  and did not return.Â  There is no suggestion he knew of Dickerson's plans beforehand\r\n  or had any involvement in the subsequent events.\r\n[2] Malik attempted to bring Dickerson's mother to\r\n  Armon's house to calm Dickerson down.Â  When Dickerson learned of this, he\r\n  threatened to kill Malik's mother and cut the baby out of Malik's pregnant\r\n  girlfriend.\r\n[3] Armon's girlfriend, Selena Rouse, was in and out of\r\n  the house during that evening, along with her young son.Â  At some point,\r\n  Dickerson asked her whether he should let Roper live or die.Â  However, there is\r\n  no evidence that she actually participated in the torture.\r\n[4] We emphasize that there is absolutely no suggestion,\r\n  let alone evidence, that Dr. Schandl or the State purposefully failed to run\r\n  confirmatory tests in order to exclude the evidence Dickerson sought to\r\n  introduce.\r\n[5] The elements of accessory after the fact are that the\r\n  felony has been completed, the accused had knowledge that the principal felon\r\n  committed the felony, and the accused harbored or assisted the principal. Fuller,\r\n  346 S.C. at 480, 552 S.E.2d at 283.Â  Murder is simply defined as &quot;the killing\r\n  of any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied.&quot; S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003).\r\n[6] Under Dickerson's view, only the defendant would have\r\n  the option of requesting this additional charge.Â  The Supreme Court of\r\n  California resoundingly rejected this very point. Birks, 960 P.2d at\r\n  1084-86.Â  Following Hopkins, questions concerning the right to a charge\r\n  on a lesser-related offense are of course questions of state law.Â  However, we\r\n  find the California court's reasoning on this point persuasive.Â  Birks was re-examining the court's prior decision in People v. Geiger, 674\r\n  P.2d 1303 (1984), which held in part that only the defendant could request a\r\n  charge on a lesser-related offense. See Birks, 960 P.2d at 1083.Â  In\r\n  reversing this portion of Geiger, the Birks court found that such\r\n  a rule created\r\n\r\n  an\r\n    unfair one-way street where lesser related offenses are at issue.Â  On the one\r\n    hand, the defendant's right to notice of the charges limits the circumstances\r\n    in which a jury, over the defendant's objection, may receive\r\n    instructions on lesser offenses which are not necessarily included in those to\r\n    which a plea was entered.Â  On the other hand, if a lesser offense is related to\r\n    the charge, as Geiger defines that term, Geiger gives the defendant\r\n      an absolute entitlement to such instructions on request, regardless of\r\n    notice or prejudice to the People, and even over their objection.\r\n  . .\r\n    . . \r\n  Where\r\n    lesser related offenses are concerned, the Geiger rule therefore may\r\n    actually permit and encourage a one-sided use of the &quot;gambling hall&quot;\r\n    strategies we have consistently denounced.Â  If the evidence suggests the\r\n    possibility of a related lesser offense neither charged nor tried by the\r\n    prosecution, the defendant either may demand that instructions on that offense\r\n    be given, or may raise notice objections which, if successful, will prevent\r\n    such instructions from being given at the prosecution's behest.Â  Geiger thus affords the defense a superior right at trial to determine whether the\r\n    jury will consider a lesser offense alternative, or instead will face an\r\n    all-or-nothing choice between conviction of the stated charge and complete\r\n    acquittal.Â  Such a rule is neither just nor rational.\r\n\r\nId. at 1085.Â  Contrary to the concurrence's view, Gentry's\r\n  holdingâ€”thatÂ  an indictment is a notice document that must be challenged prior\r\n  to the swearing of the juryâ€”is unaffected by our decision today. See 363\r\n  S.C. at 102, 610 S.E.2d at 500.Â  Here, we merely find that a defendant's\r\n  ability to waive notice of a particular charge does not also grant him an\r\n  unqualified, non-reciprocal right to request any charge supported by the\r\n  evidence, for to do so would grant him an unfair tactical advantage that\r\n  interferes with the State's prerogative of deciding on which charges to try a\r\n  defendant.

Stevens, 879 P.2d 162, 168 (Or.\r\n  1994).Â  However, we decline to adopt a categorical rule.Â  If the proffered\r\n  evidence fits within the boundaries discussed in Wise and goes to the\r\n  defendant's character, it is admissible.Â  While we are cognizant of the reasons\r\n  why these courts declined to permit this evidence, we are confident that our\r\n  existing framework is sufficient to ferret out problematic testimony.\r\n[8] Before the circuit court, Dickerson argued that our\r\n  current proportionality review is deficient because it fails to examine cases\r\n  where death was not imposed and cases where death was not even sought. See\r\n    State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 591, 300 S.E.2d 63, 75 (1982).Â  He\r\n  primarily relied upon Justice Stevens's statement regarding the denial of\r\n  certiorari in Walker v. Georgia, 129 S. Ct. 453 (2008) (memorandum\r\n  opinion), in which he wrote that examining similar cases &quot;assume[s] that\r\n  the court would consider whether there were 'similarly situated defendants' who\r\n  had not been put to the death because that inquiry is an essential part\r\n  of any meaningful proportionality review.&quot; Id. at 454.Â  In his\r\n  view, this analysis is &quot;judicious because, quite obviously, a significant\r\n  number of similar cases in which death was not imposed might well provide the\r\n  most relevant evidence of arbitrariness in the sentence before the court.&quot; Id.Â Â  Justice Stevens noted,\r\n\r\n  Had\r\n    the Georgia Supreme Court looked outside the universe of cases in which the\r\n    jury imposed a death sentence, it would have found numerous cases involving\r\n    offenses very similar to petitioner's in which the jury imposed a sentence of\r\n    life imprisonment.Â  If the Georgia Supreme Court had expanded its inquiry still\r\n    further, it would have discovered many similar cases in which the State did not\r\n    even seek death.Â  Cases in both of these categories are eminently relevant to\r\n    the question of whether a death sentence in a given case is proportionate to\r\n    the offense.Â  The Georgia Supreme Court's failure to acknowledge these or any\r\n    other cases outside the limited universe of cases in which the defendant was sentenced\r\n    to death creates an unacceptable risk that it will overlook a sentence infected\r\n    by impermissible considerations.\r\n\r\nId. at 455-56 (citations omitted).Â  This issue is not\r\n  before us on appeal, and it would require us to overrule our prior decision in Copeland.Â \r\n  However, we note our concern that restricting our statutorily-mandated\r\n  proportionality review to only similar cases where death was actually imposed\r\n  is largely a self-fulfilling prophecy as simply examining similar cases where\r\n  the defendant was sentenced to death will almost always lead to the conclusion\r\n  that the death sentence under review is proportional.Â  \r\n[9] Like the majority, I have enormous respect for\r\n  Justice Stevens.Â  If we were to be true to his views on capital sentencing,\r\n  however, we would join his minority view that imposition of the death sentence\r\n  violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.Â  Baze\r\n    v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35 (2008) (decided the term before he issued his Walker\r\n      v. Georgia statement).Â  While perhaps Justice Stevens would find our\r\n  practice of reviewing only other capital cases violative of the Eighth\r\n  Amendment, the fact remains that proportionality review is a requirement only\r\n  of state law, not the Constitution.Â  Pulley v.

Â They apparently continued to live\r\n  together in New Jersey until September 2007, at which point Marccuci left for\r\n  South Carolina and took the minor child with her. Â Taylor followed her to South\r\n  Carolina, ostensibly to find his daughter.Â  \r\nTaylor\r\n  moved in with Marccuci and his daughter at the Value Inn Hotel in North\r\n  Charleston in October, planning to stay until he earned enough money to return\r\n  to New Jersey with his child.Â  On January 23, 2008, police came to the hotel\r\n  looking for Marccuci after she failed to show up at her job.[4] Â Following a background check on Taylor, the police inexplicably and\r\n  erroneously reported he had an outstanding warrant for rape in New Jersey.[5]Â \r\n  Consequently, Taylor was arrested and taken away in chains, and his daughter,\r\n  then two years old, was placed in DSS protective custody.\r\nTaylor's travel to South Carolina was a violation of\r\n  his probation, which ultimately resulted in his incarceration in New Jersey for\r\n  five months.Â Â  However, Taylor was still in jail in South Carolina at the time\r\n  of the probable cause hearing concerning the child's removal held on January\r\n  28, 2008, and appeared pro se.[6]Â \r\n  The Grandparents traveled to South Carolina to be present as well.Â  An\r\n  agreement was reached wherein the Grandparents were added as party defendants &quot;for\r\n  the purposes of possible placement for the minor child.&quot;Â  Moreover,\r\n  both Taylor and Marccuci were temporarily restrained from having any contact\r\n  with their daughter, pending further order of the family court. Â Because DSS\r\n  requested a priority placement evaluation of the Grandparents' residence in New\r\n  Jersey, the family court issued a separate order for an expedited home study\r\n  pursuant to an interstate compact with New Jersey regarding child custody.Â  That\r\n  order was issued the same day as the hearing, but DSS did not provide the New\r\n  Jersey Department of Children and Families (NJDCF) with the necessary\r\n  information until the Grandparents retained an attorney who urged DSS to do so.Â Â \r\n  The letter approving the Grandparents' home as a licensed foster home finally was\r\n  issued by NJDCF on August 20, 2008, some eight months after the court's order.\r\nTaylor\r\n  was released from jail on June 3, 2008.Â  However, he remained subject to the\r\n  order restraining him from having contact with his daughter and admittedly made\r\n  no motion to rescind that order, relying instead on his belief that the plan\r\n  was still for the child to be placed with his parents in New Jersey after the interstate\r\n  compact study had been completed.Â  Following completion of that home study in\r\n  August 2008, no transfer of custody occurred so the Grandparents moved for an\r\n  expedited hearing to have it done. Â On December 16, 2008, that hearing was held\r\n  and the family court, by order dated March 9, 2009, mandated a two-week\r\n  transition period with Ms. Taylor[7] in Charleston where she would &quot;participate in a therapeutic clarification&quot;\r\n  with her granddaughter.Â  It is noteworthy that by this point in time,\r\n  the minor child had been in seven foster placements, none of which had\r\n  apparently involved a transition period for &quot;therapeutic clarification.&quot;\r\nThe Grandparents attempted to obtain relief from the\r\n  two-week transition period, but were unsuccessful and ultimately traveled to\r\n  South Carolina for the transition at their own expense and began visits with\r\n  the child, which were taped at the office of Dr. Don Elsey, the Clinical\r\n  Director of the Dee Norton Low Country Children's Center.Â  Despite staying\r\n  approximately eleven days, the Grandparents were only permitted to visit with\r\n  the child twice before having to return to work in New Jersey.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  they were advised by DSS that the interstate compact had &quot;run out&quot;\r\n  and their designation as foster parents was no longer viable; even if the Grandparents\r\n  completed the two-week transition period, they were informed they would not be\r\n  able to bring the minor child back to New Jersey until the compact was renewed.Â  Although the Grandparents returned to South Carolina once more after this\r\n  visit, DSS denied them visitation with the minor child and told them there\r\n  would be no more visitation.Â  \r\nFrom\r\n  the time this little girl was taken into custody until the issuance of the merits\r\n  order on the removal, this case can best be described as a procedural morass.Â \r\n  The action began in a timely manner on January 28, 2008, with the probable\r\n  cause hearing.[8]Â \r\n  The merits hearing was scheduled for February 28, but the court continued it\r\n  upon the motion of Taylor's guardian ad litem once it was clear the case\r\n  was contested.Â  At some point, the merits hearing was set for June 4.Â  However,\r\n  a pre-trial hearing scheduled for May 13 was continued until June 18 because no\r\n  judge was available; the June 4 merits hearing accordingly was rescheduled for\r\n  October 1.Â  For some reason not apparent in the record, this hearing was\r\n  continued again.Â  Frustrated at the lack of progress in this case, the\r\n  Grandparents moved for an expedited placement hearing, but that too was\r\n  continued on December 8 for unknown reasons.Â  On January 22, 2009, the hearing\r\n  on the expedited motion was again continued.[9]Â \r\n  The merits hearing was then scheduled for April 30, nearly fifteen months after\r\n  the minor child was removed by DSS, to no avail: it was continued for lack of\r\n  notice.Â  The hearing was again continued on May 4 for the same reason.Â  It was\r\n  not until July 10â€”far beyond the thirty-day limit provided for by statuteâ€”that\r\n  the merits hearing was held, and the final order was not issued until August 3,[10] over one-and-a-half years after the child was placed in protective custody.Â \r\n  The final order authorized DSS to forego efforts at reunification and pursue\r\n  TPR.Â  By the time the removal action was complete, the child had lived in seven\r\n  different foster homes and no less than seven different family court judges had\r\n  been involved.\r\nBefore\r\n  the removal action had been resolved, however, DSS had already initiated this\r\n  TPR action against Taylor and Marccuci alleging willful failure to visit,\r\n  willful failure to support, and the fact that the minor child had been in\r\n  foster care for at least fifteen of the last twenty-two months.Â  On August 10,\r\n  2010, the family court issued a final order terminating Taylor and Marccuci's\r\n  rights on all of the alleged grounds. This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIt\r\n  is well settled that before parental rights can be forever terminated, the\r\n  alleged grounds for the termination must be established by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence. Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339\r\n  (1982); Charleston Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87,\r\n  95, 627 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Moreover, on appeal, we may make our\r\n  own determination from our review of the record as to whether the grounds for\r\n  termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  \r\nSection\r\n  63-7-2570 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) provides the various ways in which a parent's rights can\r\n  be terminated.Â  That section provides as grounds for TPR, in part:\r\n\r\n(3) The\r\n  child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\n  and during that time the parent has willfully failed to visit the child. Â The\r\n  court may attach little or no weight to incidental visitations, but it must be\r\n  shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having\r\n  custody or by court order. Â The distance of the child's placement from the\r\n  parent's home must be taken into consideration when determining the ability to\r\n  visit.\r\n(4) The\r\n  child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\n  and during that time the parent has willfully failed to support the child.\r\n\r\nId. Â§\r\n  63-7-2570(3)-(4).Â  Willful conduct is\r\n  that which &quot;evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties . . .\r\n  because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to\r\n  receive support and consortium from the parent.&quot; S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992).Â  Under our\r\n  standard of review, we find DSS has failed to show either willful failure to\r\n  visit or support the minor child.\r\nWhile Taylor cannot be excused for violating his\r\n  probation by coming to South Carolina in search of Marccuci and the minor\r\n  child, it appears that DSS's case against him was initially fueled by the\r\n  erroneous information supplied by the police that he had an outstanding warrant\r\n  for rape in New Jersey.Â Â  He was then enjoined from visiting with his daughter\r\n  at the probable cause hearing, which presumably would not have been warranted\r\n  but for the erroneous information about the pending New Jersey charge.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Taylor was extradited to New Jersey where he served a five month\r\n  prison sentence for violating his probation, during which it was impossible for him to visit his daughter.Â \r\n  Afterwards, he was subject to the court order preventing any contact between\r\n  him and his daughter.Â  The mere fact that Taylor did not seek to have this\r\n  order rescinded or altered does not demonstrate any willful failure to visit on\r\n  his part; his lawful obedience of a valid court order, which was based largely\r\n  on his belief that his daughter was soon going to be returned to his parents'\r\n  custody in New Jersey, should not be used to mount a case against him for\r\n  willful failure to visit.Â  It is also of no moment that Taylor initially agreed\r\n  to the order enjoining his contact with the child.Â  Taylor, who appeared pro\r\n    se at the probable cause hearing, was facing extradition to and jail time\r\n  in New Jersey for his probation violation.Â  Furthermore, Taylor spent the next\r\n  eighteen months fighting for custody of the minor child, or, alternatively, in\r\n  support of her placement with the Grandparents.Â  Therefore, DSS has failed to\r\n  prove by clear and convincing evidence that Taylor willfully failed to visit\r\n  the child while she was in protective custody.\r\nAdditionally, we disagree that there was clear and\r\n  convincing evidence that Taylor willfully failed to support the minor child.Â \r\n  Taylor testified that he had no income while incarcerated, had no job for some\r\n  time when released, and that he tried to support the child once he did have\r\n  gainful employment but was unaware of the location of the child or even how to\r\n  pay any support to DSS.Â  Once a court order was in place for Taylor to pay\r\n  support for the child, he immediately paid on time and was never in arrears.Â \r\n  This conduct certainly does not evince a settled purpose to forego his\r\n  obligation to support his child, and we therefore hold the family court erred\r\n  in terminating Taylor's rights on this ground. \r\nThe\r\n  family court also terminated Taylor's parental rights on the ground that the\r\n  minor child had been in foster care for at least fifteen out of the last\r\n  twenty-two months, per section 63-7-2570(8). Â While the family court's\r\n  determination is technically correct, the facts of this case militate against strict\r\n  adherence to section 63-7-2570(8).Â  Indeed, this case represents an &quot;instance[]\r\n  where this statutory ground would not support termination of parental\r\n  rights.&quot; Jackson, 368 S.C. at 102 n.8, 627 S.E.2d at 773 n.8\r\n  (citing S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 356 S.C. 413, 420, 589\r\n  S.E.2d 753, 756 (2003) (Pleicones, J., concurring)).Â  Where there is &quot;substantial\r\n  evidence that much of the delay . . . is attributable to the acts of others,&quot;\r\n  a parent's rights should not be terminated based solely on the fact that the\r\n  child has spent greater than fifteen months in foster care. Cochran, 356\r\n  S.C. at 420, 589 S.E.2d at 756.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  there is substantial evidence that this little girl languished unduly in foster\r\n  care not because of any actions, or inactions, by Taylor, but because the\r\n  delays generated and road blocks erected in the removal action made it\r\n  impossible for the parties to regain legal custody of her prior to the\r\n  expiration of the fifteen month period. Â Several continuances of the removal\r\n  action were ordered, only one of which was requested by Taylor through his\r\n  guardian.Â  Taylor continued to contest his daughter being in the custody of DSS\r\n  throughout the entire process, despite not being able to appear himself in many\r\n  instances because he was incarcerated and subject to his probation. Â In fact,\r\n  DSS initiated the TPR proceedings while the removal actionâ€”the very action that\r\n  would determine whether the child was properly placed into foster care in the\r\n  first placeâ€”was still pending and contested.Â  Taking our own view of the\r\n  evidence, we find that Taylor did not sit idly by while his child was in foster\r\n  care, but rather he was stymied by the system charged with the responsibility\r\n  of protecting this child and reuniting her with her father if possible.Â  The\r\n  various continuances requested by other parties were largely the reason the\r\n  child had remained in foster care for fifteen months at the time the TPR action\r\n  was filed, and under these circumstances, we hold that this ground should not\r\n  serve as the basis for terminating this father's parental rights. \r\nAs a\r\n  final matter, we turn briefly to the purpose behind the TPR statute itself:\r\n\r\n[T]o\r\n  establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of\r\n  parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to\r\n  protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for\r\n  adoption by persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love\r\n  and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560 (1984).Â \r\n  Thus, the very purpose behind the statute is to provide for children who are &quot;abused,\r\n  neglected, or abandoned&quot; and place them with people who will nourish and\r\n  protect them. \r\n However, this child\r\n  was neither abused, neglected, nor abandoned[11] by Taylor.Â  Indeed, it is undisputed that at the time she was taken into\r\n  protective custody, she was healthy, clean, and neatly dressed.Â Â  Moreover,\r\n  there is no indication in the record that she had any behavioral problems at\r\n  the time she was removed from her father.Â  In fact, Dr. Elsey testified that\r\n  when he saw her on March 7, 2008, &quot;[s]he was a verbal, very pleasant\r\n  little two year old.&quot;Â  Although he stated she had symptoms of Reactive\r\n  Attachment Disorder, he also testified that this disorder arises in children\r\n  who have been separated from their parents.Â  \r\n We also express our\r\n  concern about the numerous unexplained delays in the removal action, as well as\r\n  DSS's apparent reluctance to return this little girl to the Grandparents\r\n  despite the fact that they previously had served as foster parents.Â  Moreover,\r\n  DSS's insistence on a two-week &quot;therapeutic clarification&quot; Â period\r\n  for the Grandparents even after the interstate compact had been complied with\r\n  seems especially inexplicable, particularly given the child's placement with\r\n  seven sets of strangers where no transition period was required.Â  While\r\n  removing this little girl from her father's care and custody in the face of his\r\n  probation violation may have been warranted, the sole basis for probable cause\r\n  contained in the caseworker's affidavit was the outstanding rape warrant, not\r\n  the probation violation.Â  Moreover, the continued procedural road blocks which prevented\r\n  the expeditious return of this child had tragic consequences for this family,\r\n  especially for this little girl who has been deprived of the opportunity to\r\n  develop a relationship with her father over the past three and half years.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that Taylor's parental rights should not be terminated based on willful\r\n  failure to support, willful failure to visit, or that the minor child has been\r\n  in foster care for more than fifteen months.Â  The order of the family court is\r\n  therefore reversed,[12] and we direct DSS to immediately implement a plan for the reunification of\r\n  Taylor and his daughter or, in the alternative, for placement of the minor\r\n  child with the Grandparents in New Jersey until that reunification can be\r\n  achieved, effective immediately upon the filing of this opinion.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a\r\n  separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm the order terminating\r\n  appellantâ€™s parental rights as I find clear and convincing evidence supports\r\n  the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc.

Â§ 9:6-3.\r\n[4] Marccuci apparently has not been heard from since,\r\n  and did not file an answer or appear at any hearing in either the removal or\r\n  TPR action.\r\n[5] The police officer did not testify in this matter and\r\n  there was no explanation why the police erroneously reported Taylor's violation\r\n  of probation charge as an outstanding warrant for rape.\r\n[6] Shortly after the hearing, he was extradited to New\r\n  Jersey, where he served the remainder of his sentence for his probation\r\n  violation.Â  \r\n[7] Although Shappell had been made a party defendant to\r\n  this action at the probable cause hearing, DSS consistently referred to him as Ms.\r\n  Taylor's &quot;paramour,&quot; and the family court ordered the transition\r\n  period only for Ms. Taylor.Â  \r\n[8] While the order that emanated from this hearing was\r\n  the result of an agreement, the lone affidavit filed in support of DSS\r\n  retaining temporary custody was from the DSS caseworker and stated, with\r\n  respect to Taylor: &quot;It was further reported that Mr. Sean Taylor was arrested\r\n  and will be extradited to New Jersey where he will be charged with rape.&quot;Â \r\n  It is not clear when DSS recognized the error in this statement, but DSS\r\n  appears to have relied on it nonetheless in justifying the removal of the\r\n  child.\r\n[9] It appears from the record that this is the same\r\n  expedited hearing that was resolved through the order dated March 9, 2009.Â \r\n  That order, however, noted the hearing was held on December 16, 2008, by\r\n  phone.Â  If our reading of the record is correct, we are puzzled as to why the\r\n  hearing held on December 16 was not brought to the attention of the family court\r\n  in January when it issued an order extending the continuance it granted\r\n  December 8 for the same matter.Â  We are also concerned that it took three\r\n  months for the court to issue an order following an expedited hearing\r\n  regarding the placement of a minor child with her own family, particularly when\r\n  it had been established by that time that Taylor had no outstanding rape charge\r\n  in New Jersey and he had already served his time for the probation violation.\r\n[10] This order apparently is the final or merits order in\r\n  the removal action, although it is captioned &quot;Final Order Judicial Review\r\n  and Permanence Planning.&quot;Â  Both the TPR court and DSS appear to treat it\r\n  as the final merits order, and it is the only order regarding removal that\r\n  seems to make all the findings required by Section 63-7-1660(B) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2008).\r\n[11] Taylor certainly did not abandon his daughter in the\r\n  traditional sense.Â  He was arrested and she was placed in DSS protective\r\n  custody ostensibly because of an outstanding warrant for rape in New Jersey\r\n  which turned out to be nonexistent.Â  While Taylor initially agreed to stay away\r\n  from his daughter until the criminal charges were sorted out, he did so\r\n  primarily based on his belief that his daughter would be expeditiously placed\r\n  with his parents. \r\n[12] Because our holding is dispositive of this appeal, we\r\n  do not reach the other issues raised by Taylor.

McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n  (declining to address additional issues when one issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Terry Lance Carter","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2011-10-05-01","description":"This is an order transferring a lawyer to incapacity inactive status.","date":"2011-10-05","type":"order","text":"\r\n  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\ntd           { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Terry\r\n          Lance Carter, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  ORDER\r\n\r\n   Respondent\r\n    is a member of the South Carolina Bar and Tennessee Bar.Â  Pursuant to Rule\r\n    29(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) provided\r\n    the Clerk of Court with a certified copy of the Supreme Court of Tennessee's\r\n    April 25, 2011, order transferring respondent to disability inactive status in\r\n    that State.Â  In accordance with Rule 29(b), the Clerk provided the order to ODC\r\n    and respondent and gave the parties thirty (30) days in which to inform the\r\n    Court of any reason why respondent should not be transferred to incapacity\r\n    inactive status in South Carolina.Â  Neither ODC nor respondent filed a\r\n    response.Â  \r\n   Pursuant\r\n    to Rule 29, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, respondent is hereby transferred to\r\n    incapacity inactive status.Â  \r\n  \r\n  IT IS SO ORDERED.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

Todd, Assistant Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nBrian C.\r\n  Reeve, of Columbia, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to the imposition of a definite suspension not to exceed two (2)\r\n  years.Â  Respondent further agrees to pay the costs incurred in the\r\n  investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission on\r\n  Lawyer Conduct (the Commission).Â Â  In addition, he agrees to complete the Ethics\r\n  School and Trust Account School portions of the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\n  Program prior to seeking reinstatement.Â  We accept the Agreement and impose a\r\n  definite suspension of two (2) years.Â  In addition, respondent shall pay the\r\n  costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and\r\n  the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of this order.Â  Respondent\r\n  shall not seek reinstatement until he has completed the Ethics School and Trust\r\n  Account School portions of the Legal Ethics and Practice Program.Â  The facts,\r\n  as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\n Respondent was\r\n  admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1983.Â  In late 2009, he closed his law\r\n  office and ceased practicing law.Â  Although respondent initially notified the\r\n  South Carolina Bar of his change of address, he since moved and failed to\r\n  update his address with the Bar as required by Rule 410(e), SCACR.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits violating Rule 410(e), SCACR, and acknowledges that his failure to keep\r\n  the Bar informed of his current address resulted in him not receiving some of\r\n  ODC's inquiries in the matters discussed below.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\n In\r\n  January of 2002, Complainant A bought a mobile home and land in Laurens\r\n  County.Â  In May of 2009, Laurens County served Complainant A with a back tax\r\n  notice for the mobile home.Â  Complainant A contacted Laurens County and was\r\n  advised that the mobile home was not in Complainant A's name and that\r\n  Complainant A needed a copy of the title.Â  Complainant A's mortgage company\r\n  forwarded all closing document to Complainant A, but there was no title for the\r\n  mobile home.Â  \r\n Complainant\r\n  A contacted respondent's office and was informed that Complainant A's file\r\n  would need to be pulled from storage.Â  Complainant A communicated with\r\n  respondent's office directly and, later, through counsel, for several months.Â \r\n  Respondent ultimately filed a corrective deed to resolve the issue, but failed\r\n  to inform Complainant A that he had done so.Â  Respondent admits he did not\r\n  adequately communicate with Complainant A regarding this issue and closed his\r\n  office without notice to Complainant A.Â  \r\n Respondent\r\n  responded to ODC's initial inquiry regarding the letter of complaint.Â  On April\r\n  15, 2010, ODC forwarded a Notice of Full Investigation to respondent regarding\r\n  this matter via certified mail.Â  The certificate of receipt was signed for and\r\n  returned to ODC, but respondent failed to respond to the Notice of Full\r\n  Investigation.Â  On May 25, 2010, ODC forwarded a Notice to Appear and Subpoena\r\n  to respondent regarding this matter via certified mail and regular first class\r\n  mail.Â  Respondent was to appear before ODC on June 17, 2010.[1]Â  Respondent did not appear pursuant\r\n  to the Notice to Appear and did not send the documentation pursuant to the\r\n  subpoena.Â  He did, however, appear for an interview on October 6, 2010.Â \r\n  Although he answered questions during his interview, he never submitted a\r\n  written response to the Notice of Full Investigation.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\n During\r\n  his practice, respondent was an agent for a title insurance company.Â  The title\r\n  insurance company filed a complaint against respondent and ODC forwarded the\r\n  complaint and a Notice of Investigation to respondent.Â  Respondent did not\r\n  respond to the Notice of Investigation or to a reminder letter sent pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).Â \r\n  Respondent also failed to appear for an interview scheduled on June 17, 2010,\r\n  but did appear for an interview scheduled on October 6, 2010.Â  Although\r\n  respondent answered questions during his interview, he never provided ODC with\r\n  a written response to the Notice of Investigation.\r\n Thereafter,\r\n  on two occasions, ODC sent respondent additional information received from the\r\n  title insurance company and, on both occasions, respondent provided a written\r\n  response.Â  The title insurance company asserts respondent failed to remit\r\n  $415.90, representing the company's portion of title insurance premiums on four\r\n  closings.Â  Respondent submits he believes he remitted all premiums due, but\r\n  cannot establish payment because he failed to keep his financial records after\r\n  closing his practice.Â  Respondent submits that he closed his trust account\r\n  after waiting to ensure all outstanding items had cleared.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\n Respondent\r\n  was the closing attorney on Complainant B's home purchase in 2005.Â  After\r\n  respondent closed his office, Complainant B determined she needed her file.Â \r\n  Complainant B made numerous unsuccessful attempts to locate respondent and her\r\n  file before filing a complaint with ODC.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  did not respond to ODC's Notice of Investigation or to the reminder letter sent\r\n  pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, id.Â  Respondent never\r\n  submitted a written response to the complaint.Â Â  \r\n Respondent\r\n  appeared for an on-the-record interview on October 6, 2010.Â  During the\r\n  interview, respondent admitted that, although he was aware Complainant B was\r\n  trying to retrieve her file, he made no effort to ensure she received her file\r\n  or its contents.Â  \r\nLAW\r\n Respondent admits he\r\n  has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about\r\n  status of matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information);\r\n  Rule 1.15 (d) (lawyer shall\r\n  promptly deliver to client or third person any funds or other property that the\r\n  client or third person is entitled to receive); Rule 1.16(d) (upon termination\r\n  of representation, lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable\r\n  to protect clientâ€™s interests, including surrendering papers and property to\r\n  which the client is entitled); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to\r\n  expedite litigation consistent with interests of client); Rule 8.1 (lawyer\r\n  shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information from\r\n  disciplinary authority); and Rule\r\n    8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n    Professional Conduct).Â  In addition, respondent admits he has violated the\r\n    recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp; Respondent admits\r\n  that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to\r\n  pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice\r\n  law).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and impose a definite suspension of two (2) years.Â  Within thirty\r\n  (30) days of the date of this order, respondent shall pay the costs incurred by\r\n  ODC and the Commission in the investigation and prosecution of this matter.Â \r\n  Respondent shall not seek reinstatement until he has completed\r\n  the Ethics School and Trust Account School portions of the Legal Ethics and\r\n  Practice Program.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\n  complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,

Trier, Jr., hired respondent to represent him\r\n  in a criminal matter.Â  At some point thereafter, respondent became aware that\r\n  Mr. Trier was seeking assistance in protecting the proceeds of his criminal\r\n  activities.Â  Respondent assisted Mr. Trier in obtaining advice and\r\n  representation concerning the disposition of the proceeds of Mr. Trier's\r\n  criminal activities.Â  In consultation with others, respondent knowingly\r\n  conspired with Mr. Trier to take actions that were intended to hide, conceal,\r\n  and protect the proceeds and assets that resulted from Mr. Trier's criminal\r\n  activities.Â  \r\n Respondent\r\n  was charged with Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud and Money Laundering in\r\n  violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371.Â  On September 16, 2009, respondent pled guilty to\r\n  Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud and Money Laundering.Â  On October 13, 2010,\r\n  respondent was committed to the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons\r\n  to be imprisoned for a total term of twelve (12) months and one (1) day.Â  In\r\n  addition, he was deemed to be jointly and severally liable for restitution in\r\n  the amount of $483,350.00.Â  \r\nLAW\r\n Respondent admits that, by his\r\n  misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall not assist a\r\n  client in conduct that lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent), Rule 8.4(a) (it\r\n  is professional misconduct forÂ  lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a\r\n  criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness\r\n  or fitness as a lawyer in other respects), Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit\r\n  or misrepresentation), and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a\r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice).Â  \r\n Further, respondent admits his\r\n  misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for lawyer to be convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or a\r\n  serious crime), and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to\r\n  bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct\r\n  demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent, retroactive to September 22, 2009, the date\r\n  of his interim suspension. Â Id.

Todd, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nStephen John Henry, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this\r\n  attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and\r\n  respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to\r\n  Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct\r\n  and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand or a definite suspension\r\n  from the practice of law not to exceed nine (9) months.Â  In addition,\r\n  respondent agrees to the imposition of certain conditions dependent upon the\r\n  sanction issued.Â  Finally, respondent agrees to pay the costs incurred by ODC\r\n  and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) in the investigation and\r\n  prosecution of this matter. \r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement and impose a nine (9)month suspension with the following\r\n  conditions:Â  1) within twenty (20) days of the filing of this opinion, respondent\r\n  shall certify to the Commission that she has read the South Carolina Notary\r\n  Public Manual published by the South Carolina Secretary of State and 2) if she is\r\n  reinstated to the practice of law, respondent shall notify the Commission\r\n  before returning to practice and, no later than three (3) months after\r\n  returning to the practice of law, she shall begin quarterly reporting of her\r\n  trust account activity to the Commission for a period of one (1) year.Â  The\r\n  trust account reports shall include copies of respondent's bank statements,\r\n  including copies of her cancelled checks, copies of her deposit records, a copy\r\n  of her receipt and disbursement journal, copies of her ledgers for any clients\r\n  with a trust account balance or trust account activity, copies of her monthly\r\n  reconciliations, and any other financial records requested by the Commission as\r\n  needed to interpret the monthly reconciliations.Â  Further, within thirty (30)\r\n  days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred by\r\n  ODC and the Commission in the investigation and prosecution of this matter.Â  The\r\n  facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\n Complainant A was the personal\r\n  representative of his mother's estate.Â  Complainant A hired respondent to\r\n  assist him in probating the estate.Â  Respondent accepted a $750 retainer to be\r\n  expended at the rate of $150 per hour.Â  Initially, Complainant A wanted\r\n  assistance in evicting one of his siblings from their mother's former home.Â \r\n  Later, after a pro se attempt to sell the home to one of the\r\n  heirs, Complainant A sought respondent's assistance in obtaining court approval\r\n  for the sale.Â  The heirs litigated various issues, including the sale of the\r\n  home to one of the heirs.Â  \r\n Respondent made procedural errors in\r\n  some of her pleadings, failed to correctly serve at least one defendant, and\r\n  failed to file an answer to a complaint filed by two of the heirs.Â \r\n  Approximately ten months after her representation began, respondent failed to\r\n  appear at a probate court hearing.Â  Respondent attributed her failure to appear\r\n  to a calendaring mistake.Â  \r\n As a result of her failure to appear,\r\n  the probate court sanctioned respondent and Complainant A terminated her\r\n  services.Â  Thereafter, respondent submitted an invoice to Complainant A and the\r\n  probate court, seeking protection of her outstanding fees.Â  The invoice\r\n  indicated respondent was owed a balance of $7,650.Â  Among other billing\r\n  entries, respondent charged two hours for preparing the invoice.\r\n In a letter to respondent, Complainant\r\n  A disputed the fee and took the position that the estate did not owe respondent\r\n  any additional fees.Â  Complainant A forwarded this letter to the Commission;\r\n  the letter was forwarded to ODC where it was treated as a letter of\r\n  complaint.Â Â Â  \r\n The probate court accepted testimony\r\n  on the question of respondent's fee.Â  During her testimony, respondent admitted\r\n  she had not maintained contemporaneous time records and created her invoice\r\n  after her termination based on her review of the file and her recollection of\r\n  how much time she would typically devote to the various tasks performed.\r\n In an order awarding fees to\r\n  respondent, the probate court expressed concern about the accuracy of\r\n  respondent's time estimates and whether all of the hours she claimed to have\r\n  expended were necessary.Â  The probate court expressed further concern that most\r\n  of respondent's billing entries were for full hours and the smallest entry was\r\n  for one-fourth of an hour.Â  The probate court determined respondent was\r\n  entitled to a total of $1,500 for her services to the estate; this amount\r\n  included the $750 retainer she initially received.Â  Respondent appealed the\r\n  court's order, but later abandoned the appeal.Â  \r\n Although respondent admits she should\r\n  have maintained contemporaneous time records and should not have billed Complainant\r\n  A for the time to prepare the invoice, she contends her invoice accurately\r\n  reflected the time she spent on Complainant A's case.Â  \r\n\r\nMatter II\r\n Complainant B hired respondent to\r\n  represent him in a divorce action brought by his wife.Â  Although Complainant B\r\n  wanted a divorce, he disputed the grounds for divorce cited by his wife.Â  \r\n Respondent charges an hourly rate in\r\n  contested cases and a flat rate for uncontested cases.Â  Although she did\r\n  communicate her hourly rate to Complainant B, the fee agreement he signed\r\n  covered both uncontested and contested divorce cases and did not clearly\r\n  explain how respondent's fee would be calculated in a contested case.Â  This\r\n  difficulty was exacerbated because respondent inadvertently and incorrectly\r\n  wrote &quot;uncontested divorce&quot; on a receipt she issued to Complainant B\r\n  and Complainant B refused to accept that his divorce was contested.Â  \r\n The relationship between Complainant B\r\n  and respondent deteriorated, in part because of Complainant B's erroneous\r\n  belief that his case was uncontested and he should be entitled to pay\r\n  respondent accordingly.Â  Complainant B complained to the Greenville County Bar\r\n  Association and a member of the bar's client relations committee attempted to\r\n  mediate the dispute between respondent and Complainant B.Â  Those efforts were\r\n  unsuccessful and respondent filed a motion to be relieved with the family\r\n  court.Â  In preparation for a hearing in the matter, respondent prepared an invoice\r\n  to give Complainant B.Â  Although the invoice was based on an hourly rate,\r\n  respondent created the invoice from a review of her file because she had not\r\n  maintained any contemporaneous time records.Â  The invoice included a charge of\r\n  one hour for time spent requesting a hearing date on her motion to be\r\n  relieved.Â  Respondent also included entries totaling five hours for the time\r\n  she spent communicating with the Greenville County Bar Association member who\r\n  was trying to resolve her differences with Complainant B.Â  \r\n Respondent admits she should not have\r\n  billed Complainant B for the time she spent communicating with the Greenville\r\n  County Bar Association or the time she spent moving to be relieved because\r\n  these items were not contemplated by the fee agreement.Â  She otherwise contends\r\n  her invoice accurately reflected the time she spent on the case but realizes\r\n  she should have kept contemporaneous time records because she was charging\r\n  Complainant B by the hour.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\n Respondent issued four checks on her\r\n  trust account which were returned for insufficient funds.Â  Respondent admits\r\n  her account was overdrawn because she failed to maintain proper records for her\r\n  trust account as required by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  In addition to failing to\r\n  conduct complete monthly reconciliations, respondent failed to maintain an\r\n  accurate receipt and disbursement journal and accurate client ledgers to assist\r\n  her in the reconciliation process.Â  \r\n Respondent's practice is such that the\r\n  only funds she typically holds in trust are for filing fees and service of\r\n  process.Â  At times, respondent deposited personal funds into the account to\r\n  avoid overdrafts.Â  Because of her lack of adequate recordkeeping, respondent\r\n  was unable to provide ODC with an accurate accounting of the funds currently\r\n  held in trust which, at the time, totaled less than $100.Â  \r\n Respondent maintains she did not\r\n  misappropriate any client funds and did not deposit unearned fees into her\r\n  operating account; ODC does not dispute these contentions.Â  During the\r\n  investigation, respondent completed a Continuing Legal Education Course on\r\n  trust accounting. Â She represents she has also sought and implemented the\r\n  advice of a Certified Public Accountant to bring her trust accounting practices\r\n  into compliance with Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp; \r\n Respondent acknowledges it is her\r\n  responsibility to reconcile her trust account and return any funds due to her\r\n  clients or other payees.Â  If, after due diligence, respondent is unable to\r\n  locate the payees for identified funds, she understands she must deliver those\r\n  funds in accordance with the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  27-18-10 to -400 (2007).Â  If, after due diligence, respondent is unable to\r\n  identify the proper payees of remaining funds, she understands she must deliver\r\n  those funds to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\n Complainant C hired respondent to\r\n  pursue a contempt action against her ex-husband who was not meeting his spousal\r\n  support obligation.Â  Respondent filed a Summons and Complaint, along with\r\n  Complainant C's Verification.Â  \r\nRespondent later discovered an\r\n  error in her pleadings and drafted an Amended Summons and Complaint.Â \r\n  Respondent represents she contacted Complainant C to inform her of the Amended\r\n  Complaint and told Complainant C she would take care of the situation.Â  Rather\r\n  than have Complainant C sign a Verification of the amended pleading, respondent\r\n  signed Complainant C's name to the Verification and notarized the signature.Â \r\n  Respondent did not have Complainant C's permission to sign her name nor did she\r\n  notify Complainant C that she did so.Â  \r\nAlthough respondent realizes her\r\n  actions were wrong and violated her responsibilities as a notary, she submits\r\n  that, at the time, she was simply attempting to avoid an inconvenience to\r\n  Complainant C.Â  \r\nLAW\r\n Respondent admits that by her\r\n  misconduct she has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation), Rule\r\n  1.5(a) (lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an\r\n  unreasonable fee), Rule 1.5(b) (scope of the representation and the basis or\r\n  rate of the fee for which the client will be responsible shall be communicated\r\n  to the client, preferably in writing), Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of\r\n  clients or third persons that is in lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a\r\n  representation separate from lawyerâ€™s own property), Rule 3.3 (lawyer shall not\r\n  knowingly make false statement of fact or law to tribunal), Rule 8.4(a) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for\r\n    lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit\r\n  or misrepresentation), and Rule 8.4(e)\r\n    (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is\r\n    prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent further admits she\r\n    violated the recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp; In\r\n  addition, respondent admits that hers actions constitute grounds for discipline\r\n  under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1)\r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for\r\n  a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice\r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We\r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the\r\n  practice of law for nine (9) months with the following conditions:Â  1) within\r\n  twenty (20) days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall certify to the\r\n  Commission that she has read the South Carolina Notary Public Manual published\r\n  by the South Carolina Secretary of State and 2) if she is reinstated to the\r\n  practice of law, respondent shall notify the Commission before returning to\r\n  practice and shall, no later than three (3) months after returning to the\r\n  practice of law, begin quarterly reporting of her trust account activity to the\r\n  Commission for a period of one (1) year.Â  The trust account reports shall\r\n  include copies of respondent's bank statements, including copies of her\r\n  cancelled checks, copies of her deposit records, a copy of her receipt and\r\n  disbursement journal, copies of her ledgers for any clients with a trust\r\n  account balance or trust account activity, copies of her monthly\r\n  reconciliations, and any other financial records requested by the Commission as\r\n  needed to interpret the monthly reconciliations.[1] Â Within thirty (30) days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall pay\r\n  the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission in the investigation and\r\n  prosecution of this matter.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the filing of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating she has complied with\r\n  the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In imposing this sanction, the Court is mindful\r\n  of respondent's disciplinary history which includes a private reprimand in 1993\r\n  and 1996, a public reprimand in 2005, In the Matter of Nwangaza, 362\r\n  S.C. 208, 608 S.E.2d 132 (2005), and a letter of caution with a finding of minor\r\n  misconduct in 2007.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Gopal, Inc. and Super 8 Motels, Inc.,\r\n  384 S.C. 238, 680 S.E.2d 917 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  This case is now before the\r\n  Court upon grant of Petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari, pursuant to\r\n  Rule 242(a), SCACR.\r\nIssue\r\nI.&nbsp; Whether the court of appeals\r\n  erred in upholding the circuit court's finding that Respondent did not have a\r\n  duty to protect Petitioner from the criminal act of a third party.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment under the same standard\r\n  required of the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Edwards v. Lexington\r\n    County Sheriff's Dep't, 386 S.C. 285, 290, 688 S.E.2d 125, 128 (2010).Â \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP, provides that summary judgment may be granted if a review of\r\n  all documents submitted to the court shows there is no genuine issue as to any\r\n  material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court\r\n  must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Gignilliat v.\r\n    Gignilliat, Savitz &amp; Bettis, L.L.P., 385 S.C. 452, 456, 684 S.E.2d 756,\r\n  758 (2009).Â  In a negligence case, where the burden of proof is a preponderance\r\n  of the evidence standard, the non-moving party must only submit a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment.Â  Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803\r\n  (2009). \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues the court of appeals placed too much emphasis on the lack of evidence of\r\n  other crimes committed at the motel prior to the assault on Petitioner when it\r\n  upheld the circuit court's grant of summary judgment.Â  Petitioner contends the\r\n  court of appeals should have instead considered the evidence submitted as a\r\n  whole, arguing the evidence, viewed in its entirety, raised a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact as to whether Respondent had a duty of care with respect to\r\n  Petitioner.Â  In our opinion, Petitioner's submissions to the circuit court\r\n  provided at least a scintilla of evidence that the criminal assault on\r\n  Petitioner was foreseeable.Â  However, Petitioner offered no evidence that\r\n  Respondent's preventative measures were unreasonable under the circumstances. Therefore,\r\n  we uphold the circuit court's grant of summary judgment.\r\nIn\r\n  any negligence action, the threshold issue is whether the defendant owed a duty\r\n  to the plaintiff. Â See Daniel v. Days Inn of America, Inc., 292 S.C.\r\n  291, 295, 356 S.E.2d 129, 131 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating the familiar components\r\n  of a negligence actionâ€”duty, breach, causation, and damages).Â  In South\r\n  Carolina, while an innkeeper is not the insurer of safety of its guests, it is\r\n  settled that an innkeeper &quot;is under a duty to its guests to take\r\n  reasonable action to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical\r\n  harm.&quot;Â  Allen v. Greenville Hotel Partners, Inc., 405 F. Supp.2d\r\n  653, 659 (D.S.C. 2005) (quoting Courtney v. Remler, 566 F. Supp. 1225,\r\n  1231 (D.S.C. 1983)). As a guest at the motel, Respondent undoubtedly had a duty\r\n  to protect Petitioner on some level.Â  The extent of that duty may be determined\r\n  with an analysis of whether the innkeeper knew or had reason to know of a probability\r\n  of harm to its guests. Â Daniel, 292 S.C. at 296, 356 S.E.2d at 132 (citing\r\n    Courtney, 566 F. Supp. at 1232).Â  Perhaps a clearer description of a\r\n  business owner's duty, then, is that a business owner has a duty to take\r\n  reasonable action to protect its invitees against the foreseeable risk\r\n  of physical harm.\r\n\r\nFour\r\n  basic approaches to the foreseeability issue have emerged amongst jurisdictions\r\n  nationally.Â  Miletic v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 339 S.C. 327, 331, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 68, 69 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Posecai v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\r\n  752 So.2d 762, 766 (La. 1999)).Â  The first approach, considered to be somewhat\r\n  outdated, is known as the imminent harm rule.Â  Miletic, 339 S.C. at 331,\r\n  529 S.E.2d at 69.Â  Under this rule, the landowner owes no duty to protect\r\n  patrons from violent acts of third parties unless he is aware of specific and\r\n  imminent harm about to befall him.Â  Id. at 331, 529 S.E.2d at 70.Â  Â Â This\r\n  Court adopted this rule in Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc.:\r\n\r\nThere is\r\n  no duty upon the owners or operators of a shopping center, individually or\r\n  collectively, or upon merchants and shopkeepers generally, whose mode of\r\n  operation of their premises do not attract or provide a climate for crime, to\r\n  guard against the criminal acts of a third party, unless they know or have\r\n  reason to know that acts are occurring or about to occur on the premises\r\n  that pose imminent probability of harm to an invitee; whereupon a duty\r\n  of reasonable care to protect against such act arises.\r\n\r\n269 S.C. 479, 484, 238 S.E.2d\r\n  167, 169 (1977) (quoting and expounding the rule in Cornpropst v. Sloan,\r\n  528 S.W.2d 188, 198 (Tenn. 1975)) (emphasis supplied).Â  This standard has been\r\n  criticized as imposing too minimal a duty on business owners to protect\r\n  patrons. Â Delta Tau Delta v. Johnson, 712 N.E.2d 968, 972 (Ind. 1999); McClung v.\r\n    Delta Square Ltd. P'ship, 937 S.W.2d 891, 902 (Tenn. 1996).Â  Since adopting this standard, Tennessee has\r\n  replaced its imminent harm rule with the balancing test, discussed below.Â  McClung,\r\n  937 S.W.2d at 902. \r\n A second approach\r\n  is the prior or similar incidents test.Â  Miletic, 339 S.C. at 331, 529\r\n  S.E.2d at 70 (citing Posecai, 752 So.2d at 765).Â  This is the test urged\r\n  by Respondent, and in our view, is the test applied by the circuit court and\r\n  court of appeals in this case.Â  Under this test, foreseeability may only be\r\n  established by evidence of previous crimes on or near the premises.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Courts following this test will consider the nature and extent of previous\r\n  crimes, their frequency, recency, and similarity to the crime at issue.Â  Id.Â \r\n  With this approach, some courts require that prior crimes be of the same\r\n  general type and nature as the offense at issue, see, e.g., Taylor v.\r\n    Hocker, 428 N.E.2d 662, 664-65 (Ill. App. Ct. 1981) (holding that previous\r\n  crimes against property were insufficient to put the landowner on notice of\r\n  personal assaults against its patrons), while others will impose a duty to\r\n  protect patrons based on past crimes of any type, see, e.g., Polomie\r\n    v. Golub Corp., 640 N.Y.S.2d 700, 701 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996) (&quot;[T]here\r\n  is no requirement that the past experience relied on to establish\r\n  foreseeability be of the same type of criminal conduct to which plaintiff was\r\n  subjected . . . .&quot;).Â  The prior incidents test offers the same advantages as\r\n  the imminent harm testâ€”it prevents businesses from effectively becoming the\r\n  insurer of the public's safety.Â  However, for the following reasons, we do not\r\n  believe evidence of prior criminal incidents should be the sine qua non of determining the foreseeability required to establish a duty:\r\n\r\n  First, the rule leads to results which are\r\n  contrary to public policy . . . . [U]nder the rule, the first victim always\r\n  loses, while subsequent victims are permitted recovery. Such a result is not\r\n  only unfair, but is inimical to the important policy of compensating injured\r\n  parties. Â Surely, a landowner\r\n  should not get one free assault before he can be held liable for criminal acts\r\n  which occur on his property.\r\nSecond, a rule which limits evidence of\r\n  foreseeability to prior similar criminal acts leads to arbitrary results and\r\n  distinctions. Under this rule, there is uncertainty as to how &quot;similar&quot;\r\n  the prior incidents must be to satisfy the rule. The rule raises a number of\r\n  other troubling questions. For example, how close in time do the prior\r\n  incidents have to be? How near in location must they be? The rule invites\r\n  different courts to enunciate different standards of foreseeability based on\r\n  their resolution of these questions.\r\nThird, the rule erroneously equates\r\n  foreseeability of a particular act with previous occurrences of similar acts .\r\n  . . . The mere fact that a particular kind of an accident has not happened\r\n  before does not . . . show that such accident is one which might not reasonably\r\n  have been anticipated. Thus, the fortuitous absence of prior injury does not\r\n  justify relieving defendant from responsibility for the foreseeable consequences\r\n  of its acts.\r\n\r\nIsaacs v. Huntington Mem'l Hosp., 695 P.2d 653, 658-59 (Cal. 1985)\r\n  (internal citations and quotations omitted); see also Michael J.\r\n  Yelnosky, Comment, Business Inviters' Duty to Protect Invitees from Criminal\r\n    Acts, 134 U. Pa. L. Rev. 883, 905 (1986) (observing that the prior similar\r\n  acts test produces &quot;extraordinarily arbitrary results&quot; and\r\n  &quot;denies . . . compensation to the first victim&quot;).\r\n A\r\n  majority of jurisdictions have adopted the totality of the circumstances\r\n  approach in an effort to prevent the &quot;rigid application of a\r\n  mechanical&quot; prior incidents rule.Â  Isaacs, 695 P.2d at 659; see\r\n    also District of Columbia v. Doe, 524 A.2d 30, 33 (D.C. 1987); Seibert v. Vic Regnier Builders, Inc., 856 P.2d 1332, 1339 (Ariz. 1993); Doud\r\n      v. Las Vegas Hilton Corp., 864 P.2d 796, 802 (Nev. 1993); Clohesy v.\r\n        Food Circus Supermarkets, Inc., 694 A.2d 1017, 1023-24 (N.J. 1997); Reitz\r\n          v. May Co. Dept. Stores, 583 N.E.2d 1071, 1074 (Ohio Ct. App. 1990).Â  Under\r\n  this test, courts will\r\n  consider all relevant factual circumstances, &quot;including the nature,\r\n  condition, and location of the land, as well as prior similar incidents, to\r\n  determine whether a criminal act was foreseeable.&quot;Â  Delta Tau Delta v.\r\n    Johnson, 712 N.E.2d 968, 972 (Ind. 1999).Â  Therefore, &quot;[t]he lack of\r\n  prior similar incidents will not preclude a claim where the landowner knew or\r\n  should have known that the criminal act was foreseeable.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  973.Â  This test is the broadest of the four approaches.\r\n Because\r\n  of its broad applicability, the totality of the circumstances approach has been\r\n  subject to criticism.Â  See Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Ctr., 863\r\n  P.2d 207, 215 (Cal. 1993) (noting that, at the time, it was the only\r\n  jurisdiction employing the standard); McClung, 937 S.W.2d at 900\r\n  (&quot;[T]he totality approach arguably requires businesses to implement\r\n  expensive security measures (with costs passed on to consumers) and makes them\r\n  the insurers of customer safety, two results which courts seek to\r\n  avoid.&quot;);Â  Uri Kaufman, When Crime Pays: Business Landlord's\r\n    Duty to Protect Customers from Criminal Acts Committed on the Premises, 31\r\n  S. Tex. L. Rev. 89, 112 (1990) (stating the totality approach's effect is to\r\n  impose an unqualified duty on businesses in high crime areas to provide\r\n  elaborate security).Â  The Supreme Court of Tennessee expressed concern over the\r\n  natural consequence of this test in McClung v. Delta Square Limited\r\n    Partnership: &quot;[b]usinesses may react by moving from poorer areas where\r\n  crime rates are often the highest.Â  Not surprisingly then, the totality of the\r\n  circumstances test has been described as 'imprecise,' 'unfair,' and\r\n  'troublesome' because it makes liability for merchants even less predictable\r\n  than under the prior incidents rule.&quot; 937 S.W.2d at 900 (citations omitted).Â \r\n  We note that, in McClung, the Supreme Court of Tennessee abandoned the\r\n  imminent harm test put forth in Cornpropst v. Sloan, the case on which this\r\n  Court relied in Shipes.Â  We, too, believe that a totality of the\r\n  circumstances test shifts too great a burden on business owners, and effectively\r\n  requires businesses to anticipate crime by virtue of the unfortunate fact that\r\n  crime is endemic in today's society.Â  Â \r\n The fourth and\r\n  final approach adopted by courts is the balancing test; an approach originally formulated\r\n  by the California Supreme Court, Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Ctr.,\r\n  863 P.2d 207, 214-15 (1993), and that has since been adopted by the supreme courts\r\n  of Tennessee, McClung, 937 S.W.2d at 902, and Louisiana, Posecai,\r\n  752 So.2d at 768.Â  See also Krier v. Safeway Stores 46, Inc., 943\r\n  P.2d 405, 415 (Wy. 1997) (approving of McClung's balancing test but not\r\n  expressly adopting).Â  &quot;The balancing approach acknowledges that duty is a\r\n  flexible concept, and seeks to balance the degree of foreseeability of harm\r\n  against the burden of the duty imposed.&quot;Â  McClung, 937 S.W.2d at 901\r\n  (citing Ann M., 863 P.2d at 215).Â  As such, the more foreseeable\r\n  a crime, the more onerous is a business owner's burden of providing security.Â  McClung,\r\n  937 S.W.2d at 901.Â  Under this test, the presence or absence of prior criminal\r\n  incidents is a significant factor in determining the amount of security required\r\n  of a business owner, but their absence does not foreclose the duty to provide\r\n  some level of security if other factors support a heightened risk.Â  Simply put\r\n  by Judge Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,\r\n  &quot;the hotel should increase its expenditures on security until the last\r\n  dollar buys a dollar in reduced expected crime costs . . . to the hotel's\r\n  guests.&quot;Â  Shadday v. Omni Hotels Mgmt. Corp., 477 F.3d 511, 514\r\n  (7th Cir. 2007).Â  \r\n At least one court\r\n  has criticized the balancing test as bleeding the line between duty and\r\n  breach.Â  See Delta Tau Delta v. Johnson, 712 N.E.2d 968, 973 (Ind. 1999)\r\n  (adopting the totality of the circumstances instead of the balancing test\r\n  because the reasonableness of a business owner's precautions &quot;is basically\r\n  a breach of duty evaluation and is best left for the jury to decide.&quot;).Â \r\n  We note this concern, but believe the heavy burden imposed on businesses by the\r\n  totality of the circumstances approach requires narrowing, and duty can be a flexible\r\n  concept.Â  As the foreseeability of potential harm increases, so, too, does the\r\n  duty to prevent against it.Â  Indeed, our courts have consistently imposed a\r\n  duty on business owners to employ reasonable measures to protect invitees from\r\n  foreseeable harm.Â  Â See Allen v. Greenville Hotel Partners, Inc., 405 F.\r\n  Supp.2d 653, 659 (D.S.C. 2005) (business owner has a &quot;duty to its guests\r\n  to take reasonable action to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical\r\n  harm&quot;).Â  In adopting a balancing approach, we do not alter this duty, but\r\n  merely elucidate how to determine (1) if a crime is foreseeable, and (2) given\r\n  the foreseeability, determine the economically feasible security measures\r\n  required to prevent such harm.Â  The optimal point at which a dollar spent equals\r\n  a dollar's worth of prevention will not always be apparent, but may be roughly\r\n  ascertained with the aid of an expert, or some other testimony. Â Shadday,\r\n  477 F.3d at 514.Â  As opposed to the imminent harm, prior incidents, or totality\r\n  of circumstances tests, we believe the balancing approach appropriately weighs\r\n  both the economic concerns of businesses, and the safety concerns of their\r\n  patrons.Â  In replacing our imminent harm test with a balancing test, we hope to\r\n  &quot;encourage[] a reasonable response to the crime phenomenon without making\r\n  unreasonable demands.&quot;Â  McClung, 937 S.W.2d at 902.\r\n We turn now to the\r\n  facts of the instant case.Â  The circuit judge found Defendants owed no duty of\r\n  care to protect Petitioner from the criminal act of a third party because\r\n  Petitioner did not demonstrate Defendants knew or had any reason to know an\r\n  assault against Petitioner would occur.Â  The circuit court determined this\r\n  based on Petitioner's failure to provide the court with specific instances of\r\n  criminal activity on the premises prior to the September 28, 1999 incident.Â  \r\n Petitioner was\r\n  unable to supply a report of criminal incidents at the Super 8 prior to the\r\n  attack on Petitioner.[2]Â Â \r\n  However, Petitioner produced a CRIMECAST report[3] that showed, in 1999, the risk of crimes against persons at the Super 8 was 3.5\r\n  times the national average risk, nearly twice the state average risk, but slightly\r\n  less than the county risk.Â  The risk of rape and robbery at the Super 8 was\r\n  above the county average, according to the report. Â Petitioner also submitted a\r\n  report indicating the robbery rate in Orangeburg County in 1999 exceeded the\r\n  state benchmark by approximately 190 percent. Â Specifically, from January 1,\r\n  1999, through September 30, 1999, 160 aggravated assaults and 60 robberies occurred\r\n  county-wide.\r\nWe\r\n  do not believe evidence of an elevated crime rate covering the expanse of an\r\n  entire county, on its own, is sufficient to prove foreseeability by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Such a finding would diminish a business's\r\n  economic incentive to expand into higher crime counties, which arguably are in\r\n  the greatest need of commercial stimulus.Â  However, we are not prepared to say\r\n  crime forecasting tools, such as the CRIMECAST report, bear no probative\r\n  value.Â  The weight given to CRIMECAST reports in determining foreseeability varies\r\n  nationally.Â  Compare Shadday v. Omni Hotel Mgmt. Corp., 2006 WL 693680\r\n  (S.D. Ind. 2006) (finding a CRIMECAST report showing the risk of rape as 3.5\r\n  times higher than the national average did not prove foreseeability sufficient\r\n  to survive summary judgment), and Ali v. Dao, 2009 WL 2567995 (N.J.\r\n  Super. A.D. 2009) (finding high CAP index was not sufficient evidence to prove\r\n  foreseeability), with Whitt v. Wal-Mart Stores East, L.P., 2010\r\n  WL 1416756 (E.D. Ky. 2010) (a low CAP index for violent crimes indicated a low\r\n  risk of a violent crime in Wal-Mart parking), and Currie v. Chevron USA,\r\n    Inc., 2006 WL 5249707 (N.D. Ga. 2006) (CRIMECAST report was sufficient to\r\n  establish lack of foreseeability).Â  In citing these cases, we note federal\r\n  courts require more from a non-moving party to survive summary judgment than do\r\n  our state courts.Â  In this case, the especial high probability of crime at the\r\n  Super 8 compared to the national and state averages raised at least a scintilla\r\n  of evidence that the crime against Petitioner was foreseeable.Â  We recognize\r\n  that, according to the report, the risk of an aggravated assault occurring at\r\n  the Super 8 was slightly lower than the county-wide risk.Â  However, the risk of\r\n  robbery and rape at the Super 8 was above the county average, and the security\r\n  measures required to curb robbery, rape, and aggravated assault are arguably\r\n  similar.Â  Based on the foregoing, we believe Petitioner produced at least some\r\n  evidence the aggravated assault was foreseeable.\r\n In so finding, this\r\n  Court must determine whether Petitioner provided any evidence Respondent's\r\n  preventative actions were unreasonable given this risk.Â  Petitioner asserts\r\n  Respondent should have either hired a security guard to patrol the premises or\r\n  installed a roving camera security system.Â  In our view, the hiring of security\r\n  personnel is no small burden.Â  Considering a business's economic interest, it\r\n  is difficult to imagine an instance where a business would be required to\r\n  employ costly security guards in the absence of evidence of prior crimes on the\r\n  premises.Â  However, a business, such as this one, in a high crime area without\r\n  evidence of prior criminal incidents may be required to institute less costly\r\n  measures to offset an elevated risk of harm, such as installing extra lighting,\r\n  fences, locks, or security cameras, or simply training existing personnel on\r\n  best security practices.\r\n As part of the\r\n  balancing approach we adopt, a determination of whether a business proprietor's\r\n  security measures were reasonable in light of a risk will, at many times, be identified\r\n  by an expert.Â  Petitioner's expert visited the Super 8 on three occasions, both\r\n  during the day and night time, to observe the neighborhood and physical layout\r\n  of the motel.Â  He determined Respondent provided adequate lighting at its\r\n  facility and the physical hardware on the door was within industry standards.Â  However,\r\n  the expert concluded the addition of a closed circuit camera or some type of\r\n  additional security personnel would have been reasonable in light of his\r\n  perceived risk.Â  The expert based his risk perception at the site primarily\r\n  upon criminal incident data he gathered from 2000 to 2004, after the assault on\r\n  Petitioner took place.Â  Determinative of this case, in our opinion, is the\r\n  expert's testimony that &quot;if . . . this is [the] first time [a criminal\r\n  incident occurred], there wasn't enough data for [Respondent] to say he really\r\n  needed to spend a bunch of money on surveillance cameras, a bunch of money on a\r\n  full-time security guard or part-time, or train his employees to do a guard\r\n  tour . . . .&quot;Â  This expert's testimony was the only evidence supplied by\r\n  Petitioner that spoke to the reasonableness of Respondent's precautions.[4] Â Â Even casting all evidence in a light most favorable to the Petitioner, he failed\r\n  to provide any evidence that Respondent should have expended more resources to\r\n  curtail the risk of criminal activity that might have been probable.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find the court of appeals' decision upholding the circuit court's\r\n  grant of summary judgment was proper.Â Â  \r\nConclusion\r\n Today, we adopt the\r\n  balancing approach to determining foreseeability in the context of whether a\r\n  business owner has a duty to protect its invitees from criminal acts of third\r\n  parties.Â  We believe this test appropriately strikes a balance between the\r\n  economic concerns of businesses and the safety concerns of the public.Â  Even with\r\n  all reasonable inferences from the evidence cast in favor of Petitioner, we\r\n  find Petitioner did not provide the circuit court any evidence that\r\n  Respondent's security measures were unreasonable given the risk of criminal\r\n  activity on the property.Â  Therefore, the circuit court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majority's decision to affirm the\r\n  Court of Appeals' decision upholding the circuit court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment, but would do so on the ground that petitioner's negligence in leaving\r\n  the safety of his motel room exceeded respondent's negligence, if any, as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  See Bass v. GOPAL, Inc., 384 S.C. 238, 247, 680\r\n  S.E.2d 917, 921-922 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n The Court of\r\n  Appeals held that, under existing South Carolina law, an innkeeper owes a duty\r\n  to her guests &quot;to provide. . . reasonable protection against injuries from\r\n  criminal acts, and the actual amount of protection depends on the amount and\r\n  types of criminal activity that have previously occurred on the\r\n  premises.&quot;Â  Bass, at 245, 680 S.E.2d at 245, fn. 4.Â  The court\r\n  distinguished this specialized innkeeper duty from that of a merchant, whose\r\n  duty to protect customers from third party criminal acts is limited to those\r\n  which the merchant has actual or constructive knowledge are, or are about to,\r\n  occur.Â  Id. [citing Miletic v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 339 S.C.\r\n  327, 529 S.E.2d 68 (Ct. App. 2000)].Â  \r\n While I appreciate\r\n  the majority's scholarly approach to the issues of duty and foreseeability, I\r\n  perceive little difference between our existing law, and the test adopted by\r\n  the majority, other than a requirement for expert testimony, and reliance upon\r\n  city/county statistics.Â  Like the Court of Appeals, I would hold that since\r\n  there is no duty imposed upon business owners to conduct a crime analysis,\r\n  there is no reason to impute knowledge of the CRIMECAST report to respondent,\r\n  and further that these types of city/county statistical reports are irrelevant\r\n  to determining an innkeeper's duty.Â  I would not alter our existing law, but\r\n  were I to do so, I would remand to permit the parties an opportunity to meet\r\n  the newly announced test.\r\nBecause I would\r\n  hold that the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the grant of summary judgment\r\n  on the comparative negligence ground, I concur in the result reached by the\r\n  majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The appeal against Super 8 has been dismissed.Â \r\n  In describing the procedural history preceding this appeal, we refer to Super 8\r\n  and Gopal collectively as Defendants.\r\n[2] The Orangeburg County Department of Public\r\n  Safety only has records dating back to 2000 because of a software change in\r\n  2000 that deleted records prior to that time.Â  Instead, Petitioner's expert\r\n  supplied the circuit court with a crime incident report at the Super 8 showing\r\n  three robberies, two aggravated assaults, and four simple assaults occurred on\r\n  the property from 2000 to 2004.\r\n[3] &quot;The CRIMECAST model produces probability\r\n  measures that place any location in the United States in context with national,\r\n  state and county levels of criminality.&quot;Â  The crimes against persons (CAP)\r\n  index represents the overall risk of homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated\r\n  assault.Â  \r\n[4] The affidavit of another expert supplied by\r\n  Petitioner merely agreed with the first expert's assessment as it related to\r\n  the precautionary measures required of Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27055","title":"Spence v.

Spence (&quot;Mrs.\r\n  Spence&quot;) alleges attorney Kenneth Wingate and his law firm\r\n  (&quot;Wingate&quot;)[1] breached a fiduciary duty to her as a former client regarding the handling of\r\n  her late husband's congressional life insurance policy.Â  The circuit court\r\n  granted partial summary judgment to Wingate, finding as a matter of law that\r\n  Wingate did not owe any fiduciary duties in this regard.Â  The Court of Appeals\r\n  reversed and remanded the matter for trial, holding summary judgment was\r\n  inappropriate because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to what, if\r\n  any, fiduciary duties were owed by Wingate to Mrs. Spence and whether those\r\n  duties were breached.Â  Spence v. Wingate, 385 S.C. 316, 684 S.E.2d 188\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009) (Spence III).Â  This Court granted Wingate's petition for\r\n  a writ of certiorari.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nI.Â  FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case has a complex\r\n  history and has been before the appellate courts on three prior occasions.Â  The\r\n  current dispute concerns the handling of a $500,000 Federal Group Life\r\n  Insurance Policy held by Congressman Floyd D. Spence[2] (&quot;Mr. Spence&quot;),\r\n  Mrs. Spence's late husband.Â  The facts, viewed in the light most favorable to\r\n  Mrs. Spence as required by our standard of review, are as follows.\r\nMr. Spence was a member of\r\n  United States House of Representatives, and he held a life insurance policy of\r\n  $500,000 as a member of Congress. Â On October 12, 1988, Mr. Spence executed a\r\n  Designation of Beneficiary form that named Mrs. Spence and his four sons from a\r\n  prior marriage as the beneficiaries of the congressional life insurance policy,\r\n  with all five to receive equal shares of the proceeds.Â  \r\nOn March 15, 1990, Mr. Spence\r\n  executed a codicil to a 1987 will he had made before his marriage.Â  In the\r\n  codicil Mr. Spence bequeathed to Mrs. Spence all of his interest and shares of\r\n  stock in Spence Plantation, Inc., as well as 22 acres of real estate that was\r\n  subject to a development agreement.Â  The property was located at Lake Murray , South Carolina.Â  According to Mrs. Spence, in 1994 her husband also named\r\n  her the sole beneficiary of all federal and congressional benefits, including\r\n  the life insurance policy.[3]Â Â Â  \r\nIn August 2001, Mr. Spence\r\n  was hospitalized in Mississippi.Â  He suffered a subdural hematoma while in the\r\n  hospital and thereafter underwent surgery.Â  On or about August 9, 2001, Mrs.\r\n  Spence was informed that her husband had suffered brain damage from the\r\n  subdural hematoma, was in a coma, and was not expected to survive.Â  \r\nMrs. Spence sought legal\r\n  counsel and on August 13, 2001, Wingate undertook representation of Mrs. Spence\r\n  with regards to the assets of her husband, her inheritance rights, and her\r\n  rights in his estate.Â  Wingate advised Mrs. Spence that she was entitled to\r\n  nothing from her husband's estate and that she was barred from receiving an\r\n  elective share by a prenuptial agreement.[4]Â \r\n  During the course of this representation, Mrs. Spence consulted with Wingate\r\n  about her husband's life insurance policy and &quot;informed Wingate that [her]\r\n  husband had named [her] as beneficiary.&quot;Â  \r\nTo resolve any disputes about\r\n  the effect of the 1987 will and 1990 codicil and her elective share rights, Wingate\r\n  advised Mrs. Spence to enter into an agreement with the four adult sons of Mr.\r\n  Spence to create a trust for her benefit.Â  The trust was to provide Mrs. Spence\r\n  with a lifetime income stream, and it was to be created and funded from one-third\r\n  of the value of Mr. Spence's probate estate applying a pecuniary formula. Â Wingate\r\n  negotiated the agreement concerning the division of Mr. Spence's probate\r\n  estate, and the parties formally entered into an &quot;Agreement Among\r\n  Successors to Floyd Davidson Spence, Sr.&quot; on or around August 15, 2001. Â \r\nMr. Spence died on August 16,\r\n  2001.Â  Sometime between August 23, 2001 and the first week of September 2001,\r\n  Wingate and attorney Robert P. Wilkins, Jr.[5] visited Mrs. Spence and\r\n  informed her that Wingate had agreed to represent the estate.Â  Wingate also advised\r\n  her that she no longer needed an attorney.Â  Wingate never informed Mrs. Spence\r\n  of any potential conflict of interest that he had in representing the estate,\r\n  nor did he seek her consent to, or a waiver of, any conflict of interest.Â  \r\nMrs. Spence thereafter came\r\n  to believe that the amount she received under the agreement negotiated by\r\n  Wingate was much less than what she was entitled to under the will and codicil\r\n  or if she had opted for an elective share as provided by South Carolina law. Â Mrs.\r\n  Spence met with Wingate, Wilkins, Mr. Spence's four sons, and others in a\r\n  family meeting.Â  The estate and the life insurance policy were discussed by the\r\n  parties.Â  According to Mrs. Spence, &quot;Wingate suggested that the boys\r\n  receive the insurance in what he termed an effort for me to make the boys\r\n  'whole again.'&quot;Â  However, Mrs. Spence objected to the insurance proceeds\r\n  being divided five ways, in contravention of what she stated were her husband's\r\n  wishes.Â  \r\nMrs. Spence called Ken\r\n  Wingate after the meeting and asked him to put his hat back on as her attorney\r\n  and he refused.Â  Mrs. Spence stated Wingate never advised her that she needed\r\n  to take any action to protect her rights with regard to the insurance benefits\r\n  or that she needed to hire a different lawyer to represent her regarding the\r\n  insurance benefits.[6]Â  \r\nMrs. Spence thereafter\r\n  brought a lawsuit to set aside the agreement creating the trust.Â  Wingate\r\n  withdrew as counsel for the estate in August 2002, around the time of the\r\n  lawsuit.Â  The agreement was eventually set aside.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nMrs. Spence, individually and\r\n  on behalf of her late husband's estate, filed the current action against\r\n  Wingate.[7] Â She alleged several causes of action; however, the focus here concerns her\r\n  claim for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  Mrs. Spence alleged Wingate failed to disclose\r\n  any potential conflict of interest created by him representing her and then the\r\n  estate, and that he failed to either obtain her waiver of this conflict or to protect\r\n  her interests, breaching his fiduciary duty.[8]Â  Mrs. Spence further alleged\r\n  Wingate failed to protect her interests regarding the proceeds of the $500,000\r\n  life insurance policy, for which she was the sole beneficiary.Â  Mrs. Spence\r\n  asserted Wingate owed her a fiduciary duty because Wingate had served as her\r\n  lawyer and he had discussed the insurance policy issue with her during the\r\n  course of this representation.Â  \r\nWingate moved for partial\r\n  summary judgment requesting a ruling that he was not liable to Mrs. Spence (individually\r\n  or on behalf of the estate) in connection with the congressional life insurance\r\n  policy.Â  Wingate asserted the life insurance policy was paid based upon a\r\n  contract, it was a non-probate asset, and the manner in which it was paid was\r\n  not controlled by the personal representative of the estate or by himself.Â  Additionally,\r\n  any claims related to the manner in which the benefits were to be paid belonged\r\n  to any potential beneficiaries of the policy, not the estate.[9]Â  \r\nAt the summary judgment\r\n  hearing, Wingate further argued no duty was owed to Mrs. Spence individually\r\n  because at the time the dispute arose concerning the insurance he was acting\r\n  solely as attorney for the estate and, thus, section 62-1-109 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code prevented any duty from being owed to Mrs. Spence as a\r\n  beneficiary of the estate.Â  In contrast, Mrs. Spence asserted that when a\r\n  former client comes to a lawyer and asks for legal advice on an issue related\r\n  to the former representation, the lawyer has a fiduciary duty to that client.Â \r\n  Thus, Wingate breached his fiduciary duty to her by failing to either take\r\n  action to properly advise her in the matter of the insurance policy or to\r\n  advise her that she needed to consult a different attorney to protect her\r\n  interests.Â  She noted that Wingate opened a file purporting to represent the\r\n  estate on August 15, 2001, merely two days after he undertook to represent her,\r\n  and that his representation of her and then the estate's interests created a\r\n  conflict of interest that she was not advised of and did not approve.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted\r\n  partial summary judgment in favor of Wingate and found that, &quot;[b]y\r\n  statute, [Wingate] owed no duty or obligation to [Mrs. Spence] in connection\r\n  with the congressional life insurance policy or the manner in which it was\r\n  paid.&quot; Â The circuit court relied upon section 62-1-109 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code and found Wingate owed no fiduciary duty to Mrs. Spence as a mere\r\n  beneficiary of the estate. \r\nMrs. Spence appealed, arguing\r\n  a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether Wingate breached a\r\n  fiduciary duty owed to her arising from his earlier representation of her in a\r\n  related matter.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment to\r\n  Wingate and remanded the matter for trial in Spence III.[10]Â  \r\nCiting Hotz v. Minyard,\r\n  304 S.C. 225, 403 S.E.2d 634 (1991) and Rule 1.9(a), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, the\r\n  Court of Appeals explained:Â  &quot;Duties to a former client on a related\r\n  matter are separate and distinct from any duties arising from Wingate's\r\n  representation of the estate; therefore, the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  section 62-1-109 of the South Carolina Code [ ] absolved Wingate of any duty he\r\n  owed to [Mrs. Spence].&quot;Â  Spence III, 385 S.C. at 320, 684 S.E.2d at\r\n  191.Â  The Court of Appeals concluded a factual issue exists regarding what if\r\n  any fiduciary duties were owed to Mrs. Spence, and whether these duties were\r\n  breached.Â  Id. at 319, 684 S.E.2d at 190.Â  This Court granted Wingate's\r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Spence III decision.\r\nII.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nRule 56(c) of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides a motion for summary judgment shall\r\n  be granted &quot;if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  In determining whether any triable issues\r\n  of fact exist, the trial court must view the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party\r\n  opposing the motion.Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer Senior Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr.,\r\n  386 S.C. 108, 687 S.E.2d 29 (2009).Â  An appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard used by the trial court under Rule 56(c) when reviewing the grant of a\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  Id.Â  Because summary judgment is a drastic\r\n  remedy, it should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not\r\n  improperly deprived of a trial.Â  Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters\r\n    Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004).\r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe granted certiorari to\r\n  review the Court of Appeals's conclusion that the existence of a fiduciary duty\r\n  is a question of fact and to evaluate its treatment of Hotz v. Minyard,\r\n  304 S.C. 225, 403 S.E.2d 634 (1991) in reaching that conclusion.Â  Wingate\r\n  argues the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the grant of summary judgment\r\n  because, as a matter of law, he owed no fiduciary duty to Mrs. Spence.Â  Mrs.\r\n  Spence asserts she was owed a fiduciary duty based on their former attorney-client\r\n  relationship.Â  Our review is limited to the determination of the existence a\r\n  fiduciary duty, not its breach.\r\nInitially, we note that\r\n  section 62-1-109 of the South Carolina Code is not applicable to the issue of\r\n  the congressional insurance policy.Â  This section provides: \r\nUnless\r\n  expressly provided otherwise in a written employment agreement, the creation of\r\n  an attorney-client relationship between a lawyer and a person serving as a\r\n    fiduciary shall not impose upon the lawyer any duties or obligations to\r\n      other persons interested in the estate, trust estate, or other fiduciary\r\n      property, even though fiduciary funds may be used to compensate the lawyer\r\n  for legal services rendered to the fiduciary.Â  This section is intended to be\r\n  declaratory of the common law and governs relationships in existence between\r\n  lawyers and persons serving as fiduciaries as well as such relationships\r\n  hereafter created.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-109\r\n  (2009) (emphasis added).Â  A &quot;fiduciary&quot; as\r\n  used here includes a personal representative, guardian, conservator, or\r\n  trustee.&nbsp; Id. Â§ 62-1-201(13).\r\nÂ  The\r\n  circuit court concluded Wingate, as the attorney for the estate, owed no duty\r\n  or obligation to Mrs. Spence based on section 62-1-109 and her status as merely\r\n  a &quot;person[] interested in the estate.&quot;Â  However, it is\r\n  undisputed that the congressional life insurance policy in question was a\r\n  non-probate asset[11] and the manner in which\r\n  it was paid was not controlled by the personal representative.Â  The circuit\r\n  court specifically made this finding and neither party took exception;\r\n  therefore, it is the law of the case.\r\nOn its face, section 62-1-109\r\n  limits duties only to third parties &quot;interested in the estate, trust\r\n  estate, or other fiduciary property.&quot;Â  Thus, section 62-1-109 negates any\r\n  duty owed by an attorney to persons other than the estate's representative in\r\n  matters concerning estate assets or assets controlled in some manner by the\r\n  personal representative.[12]Â  Although Wingate\r\n  represented the estate, the property in question was not a part of the estate\r\n  and was not controlled by the personal representative; therefore, the\r\n  protection provided by section 62-1-109 does not attach to Wingate on the issue\r\n  of the congressional life insurance.Â  The circuit court erred in granting\r\n  summary judgment on the basis of section 62-1-109.\r\nTurning to the question of\r\n  the determination of the existence of a fiduciary duty, this Court has said &quot;[a]\r\n  fiduciary relationship exists when one reposes special confidence in another,\r\n  so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good\r\n  faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing\r\n  confidence.&quot;Â  O'Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629,\r\n  631&nbsp;(1992).\r\nOur courts have long\r\n  recognized that an attorney-client relationship is, by its very nature, a\r\n  fiduciary relationship.Â  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 578\r\n  S.E.2d 711 (2003); Hotz v. Minyard, 304 S.C. 225, 403 S.E.2d 634 (1991); In re Green, 291 S.C. 523, 354 S.E.2d 557 (1987); Royal Crown\r\n    Bottling Co. v. Chandler, 226 S.C. 94, 83 S.E.2d 745 (1954); Wise v.\r\n      Hardin, 5 S.C. 325 (1874); Weatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 532\r\n  S.E.2d 310 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\n&quot;The relationship of an\r\n  attorney with his or her client is 'highly fiduciary in its nature and of a\r\n  very delicate, exacting and confidential character, requiring a high degree of\r\n  fidelity and good faith.'&quot;Â  Weatherford, 340 S.C. at 582, 532\r\n  S.E.2d at 315 (quoting 7 Am. Jur. 2d Attorneys at Law Â§&nbsp;137\r\n  (1997)). \r\nIn finding summary judgment\r\n  was inappropriate the Court of Appeals, citing Hotz v. Minyard,\r\n  concluded a factual issue exists regarding what if any fiduciary duties were\r\n    owed to Wife and whether these duties were breached. \r\nIn Hotz, the circuit\r\n  court granted summary judgment in favor of attorney Robert A. Dobson III on\r\n  Judy Hotz's claim for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  Hotz, 304 S.C. at 229-30,\r\n  403 S.E.2d at 636-37.Â  Dodson and Hotz had a long standing attorney-client\r\n  relationship. Â Id. at 230, 403 S.E.2d at 637.Â  Whenever she had legal\r\n  questions she sought Dodson's counsel.Â  Id.Â  Hotz had met with Dobson to\r\n  request a copy of her father's will of a certain date that had been prepared by\r\n  Dobson; the will was favorable to Hotz. Â Dobson discussed the will with Hotz\r\n  without telling her it had been revoked by a second will that he had also\r\n  prepared.Â  Id. at 227-28, 403 S.E.2d at 635-36.Â  According to Dobson,\r\n  his client (Hotz's father) had instructed him not to disclose the existence of\r\n  the second will.Â  Id.Â  Hotz &quot;claimed she trusted Dobson because of\r\n  her dealings with him over the years as her lawyer and accountant.&quot;Â  Id. at 230, 403 S.E.2d at 637.Â  The circuit court ruled Dobson owed no fiduciary\r\n  duty to Hotz because he was acting as her father's attorney and not as Hotz's\r\n  attorney in connection with the will.Â  Id. at 230, 403 S.E.2d at 637.Â Â  \r\nThis Court reversed the grant\r\n  of summary judgment, finding &quot;the evidence indicates a factual issue\r\n  [exists] whether Dobson breached a fiduciary duty to Judy [Hotz] when\r\n  she went to his office seeking legal advice about the effect of her father's\r\n  will.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added).Â  The Court stated although Dobson\r\n  represented Hotz's father, not Hotz, regarding the will, &quot;Dobson did have\r\n  an ongoing attorney/client relationship with [Hotz] and there is evidence she\r\n  had 'a special confidence' in him.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The Court further stated\r\n  that, while Dobson had no duty to disclose the existence of a second will\r\n  against the wishes of his client (Hotz's father), he owed Hotz a duty to deal\r\n  with her in good faith and to not actively misrepresent the first will.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The Court then reiterated that a question of fact existed as to &quot;whether\r\n  Dobson breached a fiduciary duty&quot; to Hotz and &quot;conclude[d] summary\r\n  judgment was improperly granted to Dobson on this cause of action.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nHotz did not state that whether a fiduciary duty is owed\r\n  is a question of fact.Â  However, the West headnotes indicate otherwise, which\r\n  might have led to some confusion in later cases that have relied upon Hotz and cited it for this proposition.Â  However, this Court has since expressly\r\n  clarified any resulting mischaracterization of the Hotz case and held:Â \r\n  &quot;The determination of the existence of a duty is solely the responsibility of the court.Â  Whether the law recognizes a particular duty is\r\n  an issue of law to be decided by the Court.&quot;Â  Hendricks v. Clemson\r\n    Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 456, 578 S.E.2d 711, 714&nbsp;(2003) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Â Â \r\nIn Hendricks, this\r\n  Court rejected the party's argument that whether a fiduciary duty was owed\r\n  between a college advisor and a student created a question of fact:\r\n\r\n  Although\r\n    whether a fiduciary relationship has been breached can be a question for the\r\n    jury, the question of whether one should be imposed between two classes of\r\n    people is a question for the court.Â \r\n    The Court of Appeals cites Hotz v. Minyard for the proposition that the existence of a fiduciary duty may\r\n    be a factual question for the jury.Â  304 S.C. 225, 403 S.E.2d 634 (1991).Â  In\r\n    our opinion, they have misapprehended Hotz. . . .Â  The Court sent the\r\n      issue of breach, not the existence of the relationship, to the jury.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 459, 578 S.E.2d at 715-16 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThus, to the extent the Court\r\n  of Appeals states in Spence III that a question of fact exists as to whether\r\n  a fiduciary duty is owed in the current matter, this was error.Â  However,\r\n  we find the Court of Appeals was correct in determining summary judgment should\r\n  be reversed because a question of fact exists as to whether Wingate breached a fiduciary duty to Mrs. Spence.\r\nIt is undisputed that\r\n  attorneys owe fiduciary duties to existing clients.Â  In addition, fiduciary\r\n  duties created by an attorney-client relationship may be breached even though the\r\n  formal representation has ended.Â  See, e.g., Burnett v. Sharp,\r\n  328 S.W.3d 594 (Tex. App. 2010) (holding the plaintiff's claim against a former\r\n  attorney for breach of fiduciary duty for failure to return the unearned\r\n  portion of a retainer fee constituted a viable claim even though the attorney's\r\n  representation had ended). \r\nThe Court of Appeals cited\r\n  Rule 1.9(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct in support of its conclusion\r\n  that duties to a former client on related matters are separate and distinct\r\n  from any duties arising out of Wingate's representation of the estate.Â \r\n  Wingate, in turn, argues that an attorney's duty to a former client is limited\r\n  to the requirements of Rule 1.9.Â  We disagree. Â In Hendricks, we\r\n  observed that &quot;[a]n affirmative legal duty exists only if created by\r\n  statute, contract, relationship, status, property interest, or some\r\n  other special circumstance.&quot;Â  Hendricks, 353 S.C. at 456, 578\r\n  S.E.2d at 714 (emphasis added). \r\nWe note that, although the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct do not, in themselves, create a cause of action\r\n  or establish evidence of negligence per se, they are relevant in assessing the\r\n  legal duty of an attorney in a malpractice action.Â  Smith v. Haynsworth,\r\n    Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 472 S.E.2d 612 (1996).Â  &quot;In\r\n  order to relate to the standard of care in a particular case, . . . a Bar rule\r\n  must be intended to protect a person in the plaintiff's position or be\r\n  addressed to the particular harm.&quot;Â  Id. at 437, 472 S.E.2d at 614\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  It is the breach of a duty, not the breach of a rule, that\r\n  is of determinative import. Â Id. at 436 n.5, 472 S.E.2d at 614 n.5.Â \r\n  Duties owed to a former client are not controlled by the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct.Â  A review of the Scope of Rule 407, SCACR clearly indicates that the\r\n  rules are intended for guidance and disciplinary purposes, not to form the\r\n  basis for civil litigation.\r\nWe further agree with the\r\n  Court of Appeals that &quot;[d]uties to a former client on a related matter are\r\n  separate and distinct from any duties arising from Wingate's representation of\r\n  the estate; therefore, the circuit court erred in finding section 62-1-109 . .\r\n  . absolved Wingate of any duty he owed to&quot; Mrs. Spence.Â  Spence III,\r\n  385 S.C. at 319-20, 684 S.E.2d at 190.Â  Section 62-1-109 simply provides that\r\n  an attorney acting as a fiduciary in a probate matter has no obligation,\r\n  without more, to other parties with interests in the fiduciary property.Â  This\r\n  statute does not purport to eliminate all obligations or duties the attorney\r\n  might have to parties arising by other means.Â  Thus, although Mrs. Spence is\r\n  not owed a fiduciary duty based on her status as a beneficiary of the estate, she\r\n  alleged Wingate's fiduciary duty arose based on their prior attorney-client\r\n  relationship. Â Wingate himself concedes in his brief that an attorney owes a\r\n  fiduciary duty to former clients.Â  Contrary to the circuit court's conclusion,\r\n  section 62-1-109 is not determinative of whether Mrs. Spence is owed a fiduciary\r\n  duty as a former client.\r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude Wingate owed a\r\n  fiduciary duty to his former client, Mrs. Spence.Â  This duty included, among\r\n  other obligations, the obligation not to act in a manner adverse to her\r\n  interests in matters substantially related to the prior representation.Â  We\r\n  agree with the Court of Appeals that whether Wingate breached a duty regarding\r\n  the congressional life insurance policy is a question of fact for a jury to\r\n  determine.Â  Thus, we uphold the decision of the Court of Appeals to reverse the\r\n  grant of summary judgment and remand this matter for trial.Â  To the extent the\r\n  Court of Appeals indicated whether a duty was owed was a question of fact for\r\n  the jury, the decision is modified to recognize that whether a fiduciary\r\n  relationship exists between two classes of persons is a matter to be determined\r\n  by a court.Â  Consequently, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed as\r\n  modified.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nActing Justices James E.\r\n  Moore and John H. Waller, Jr., concur. Acting Justice Alexander Macaulay\r\n  concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion in which\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE MACAULAY: I concur in part and respectfully dissent in part.Â  I\r\n  concur with the majority opinion that â€œthe determination of the existence [of\r\n  a] fiduciary duty is for the courtâ€ and not the jury.Â  Nevertheless, under the\r\n  allegations and undisputed facts of this particular case, the Circuit Courtâ€™s\r\n  grant of summary judgment to Petitioners, â€œthat they are not liable to Deborah\r\n  W. Spence, individually, or the Estate of Floyd D. Spence, Sr. in connection\r\n  with the congressional life insurance policy or the manner it was paid,â€ should\r\n  be affirmed and the Court of Appeals respectfully reversed.\r\nThe Respondent/Plaintiffâ€™s â€œSECOND\r\n  CAUSE OF ACTION (Breach of Fiduciary Duty as to all Defendants)â€ merely\r\n  asserts that the â€œPlaintiff and Defendants . . . were in a fiduciary\r\n  relationship as . . . Defendants were counsel for Plaintiff,â€ from whom, with\r\n  the Defendant Wilkins, â€œshe sought advice and counsel regarding the estate of\r\n  her dying husband.â€Â  As found by the majority, â€œMrs. Spence sought legal counsel\r\n  and on August 13, 2001, Wingate undertook the representation of Mrs. Spence\r\n  with regards to the assets of her husband, her inheritance rights, and her\r\n  rights in his estate.â€ As noted by the majority, â€œit is undisputed that the\r\n  congressional life insurance policy in question was a non-probate asset,â€ and,\r\n  further, â€œ[a]lthough Wingate represented the estate, the property in question\r\n  was not a part of the estate.â€ The matters of the policy and the estate, ergo,\r\n  are not related. Rule 407, 1.9(a), SCACR.\r\nMoreover, as regards â€œthe\r\n  congressional life insurance policy in question,â€™â€™ there was no â€œprior\r\n  attorney-client relationship,â€ until â€œMrs. Spence sought legal counsel and on\r\n  August 13, 2001, Wingate undertook the representation of Mrs. Spence with\r\n    regards to the assets of her husband, her inheritance rights, and her rights in\r\n    his estate.â€Â  (Emphasis supplied).Â  It was only after and â€œ[d]uring the\r\n  course of this representation, Mrs. Spence consulted with Wingate about her\r\n  husbandâ€™s life insurance policy and â€˜informed Wingate that [her] husband had\r\n  named [her] as beneficiary.â€™â€Â  Not only was there no confidential prior or\r\n  â€œongoing attorney/client relationshipâ€ regarding her husbandâ€™s life insurance\r\n  policy, but there is no allegation that Wingate â€œactively misrepresentedâ€\r\n  anything, cf. Holtz v. Minyard, 304 S.C. 225, 230, 403 S.E.2d 634, 637\r\n  (1991), â€œin connection with the congressional life insurance policy or the\r\n  manner it was paidâ€ â€” as the Circuit Court concluded in granting summary\r\n  judgment.Â  In fact, when â€œthe estate and the life insurance were discussed by\r\n  the partiesâ€ and others in a family meeting in October 2001, Mrs. Spence\r\n  acknowledged that there was no ongoing attorney/client relationship with regard\r\n  to the subject policy and she called Wingate â€œafter the meeting and asked him\r\n  to put his hat back on as her attorney and he refused.â€\r\nMrs. Spence did retain\r\n  counsel, who advised the representatives of â€œThe Estate of Congressman Floyd\r\n  David Spenceâ€ that their firm was asking the federal government for a review of\r\n  the payments that were made pursuant to the policy and that they â€œ[did] not\r\n  expect this [will] have any impact on the estate.â€Â  Accordingly, I would affirm\r\n  the Circuit Court. \r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  &quot;Wingate&quot; shall refer to Wingate individually and also his law firm,\r\n  where appropriate.\r\n[2]Â \r\n  Mr. Spence's name appears as Floyd W. Spence in the prior appeals, but it has\r\n  been corrected here to Floyd D. Spence.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Mrs. Spence's attorney explained at the summary\r\n  judgment hearing that Mr. Spence executed and submitted the necessary forms to\r\n  make the change, but the congressional benefits office apparently had the prior\r\n  form on file at the time of Mr. Spence's death.Â  \r\n[4]Â  On July 1, 1988, just a few days before their\r\n  marriage, the parties signed a prenuptial agreement, but the agreement did not\r\n  contain financial disclosures and Mrs. Spence did not have independent counsel,\r\n  so Mrs. Spence and Wingate ultimately came to believe the prenuptial agreement\r\n  was probablyÂ  unenforceable.Â  \r\n[5] Â Wilkins was the\r\n  developer for the 22 acres procured by Mr. Spence and reportedly recommended\r\n  Wingate as the attorney for Mrs. Spence.\r\n[6]Â  The Members Services Office of the United State\r\n  House of Representatives ultimately paid the proceeds of the life insurance\r\n  policy in equal shares to Mrs. Spence and each of the four sons.\r\n[7] Mrs. Spence also named attorney\r\n  Wilkins as a defendant.Â  However, Wilkins is not a party to this appeal.Â  \r\n[8]Â \r\n  Mrs. Spence's attorney stated at the hearing in this matter that a conflict\r\n  arose because Wingate negotiated an agreement using a pecuniary formula as\r\n  opposed to providing for a one-third share of the estate to be set aside as a\r\n  trust for life for Mrs. Spence.Â  The pecuniary formula was based on arriving at\r\n  a value for each of the assets in the estate, and then the trust was to be\r\n  funded using a one-third share based on what that number was.Â  A conflict arose\r\n  due to the competing interests of the estate (which wanted a lower value on the\r\n  estate assets because it would lower the estate taxes and the charge to the\r\n  estate) and Mrs. Spence (who had an interest in obtaining a higher value on the\r\n  estate assets because her share was to be funded using the pecuniary formula).\r\n[9]Â  Wingate made additional\r\n  motions for summary judgment that were also addressed in the circuit court's\r\n  order.Â  These rulings are not at issue here.\r\n[10] In the first appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed in\r\n  a split decision (2-1) on error preservation grounds, finding Mrs. Spence\r\n  should have made a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion.Â  Spence v. Wingate, 378\r\n  S.C. 486, 663 S.E.2d 70 (Ct. App. 2008) (Spence I).Â  This Court granted\r\n  certiorari on Spence I and reversed and remanded the matter to the Court\r\n  of Appeals for a ruling on the merits.Â  Spence v. Wingate, 381 S.C. 487,\r\n  674 S.E.2d 169 (2009) (Spence II).Â  Upon remand, the Court of Appeals\r\n  reversed the circuit court's order granting summary judgment to Wingate and\r\n  remanded the matter for trial.Â  Spence III, 385 S.C. at 320, 684 S.E.2d\r\n  at 191. \r\n[11]&nbsp; &quot;[P]robate estate\r\n  means the decedent's property passing under the decedent's will plus the\r\n  decedent's property passing by intestacy, reduced by funeral and administration\r\n  expenses and enforceable claims.&quot;Â  S.C.

on the remaining cases which they shared.Â  This agreement\r\n  eliminated the clients' rights to choose who would serve as counsel.Â  \r\nOn July 15, 2008, respondent\r\n  sent selection letters to the shared clients.Â  Complainant B was not informed\r\n  respondent sent the letters.Â  \r\nOn July 16, 2008,\r\n  Complainant B arrived at respondent's office to attend a recorded statement of\r\n  one of their clients.Â  Respondent met with Complainant B and informed him thatÂ \r\n  respondent would be handling the case alone.Â  Complainant B was directed to leave\r\n  the office.Â  When Complainant B asked about their earlier verbal agreement to\r\n  handle the cases together, respondent replied that the agreement was not in\r\n  writing.Â  Respondent did not inform Complainant B that he had already sent\r\n  selection letters to the clients with whom Complainant B had been working while\r\n  an associate in respondent's office.Â Â  \r\nBy letter dated July 18,\r\n  2008, respondent asked several clients who had already notified him in writing\r\n  that they wished their files to be transferred to Complainant B to reconsider\r\n  their decision.Â  \r\nRespondent represents that,\r\n  through subsequent litigation and mediation, he and Complainant B reached an\r\n  agreement to share the fees on cases that were transferred from respondent's\r\n  office and completed by Complainant B.Â  The division of fees was in compliance\r\n  with Rule 1.5(e), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\nMatter III\r\n\r\nRespondent represented the\r\n  claimant in a worker's compensation matter.Â  Complainant C is an attorney who\r\n  represented the opposing party.Â  On May 19, 2009, Complainant C arrived at\r\n  respondent's office to depose the claimant.Â  Respondent was not present.Â  \r\nRespondent had directed his\r\n  paralegal to be present at the deposition on his behalf.Â  The paralegal failed\r\n  to disclose to Complainant C that he was not an attorney prior to the\r\n  deposition.Â  Complainant C began the deposition and questioned respondent's\r\n  client for approximately thirty (30) minutes before, in response to a direct\r\n  question, the paralegal revealed he was not an attorney.Â  Complainant C immediately ceased the\r\n  deposition.Â  By letter dated May 19, 2009, respondent apologized for the\r\n  misunderstanding and offered to reschedule the deposition at Complainant C's\r\n  earliest convenience.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW\r\n\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.2(a) (lawyer shall\r\n  abide by client's decision whether to accept an offer of settlement); Rule 4.2\r\n  (lawyer shall not communicate about the\r\n  subject of representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by\r\n  another lawyer in the matter unless the lawyer has the consent of the other\r\n  lawyer);\r\n  Rule 5.3 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure firm has in effect\r\n  measures giving reasonable assurance conduct of non-lawyer retained by lawyer\r\n  is compatible with professional obligations of lawyer;

Williams, Assistant Disciplinary\r\n          Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        Amanda\r\n          Graham Steinmeyer, of West Columbia, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this attorney\r\n  disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent\r\n  have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to the imposition of a definite suspension not to exceed two (2) years\r\n  or disbarment.Â  She requests that the suspension or disbarment be made\r\n  retroactive to the date of her interim suspension, December 2, 2010.Â  In the Matter of Steinmeyer,\r\n  390 S.C 437, 702 S.E.2d 558 (2010).Â  Respondent further agrees to pay the costs\r\n  incurred by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) in the\r\n  investigation and prosecution of this matter.Â  She agrees to complete the Legal\r\n  Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account School prior to\r\n  reinstatement and, as set forth further in this order, to\r\n  reimburse the complainants and/or Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (Lawyers'\r\n  Fund) prior to seeking reinstatement or returning to the active practice of\r\n  law.Â  \r\nWe accept the agreement and disbar respondent\r\n  from the practice of law in this state, retroactive to the date of her interim\r\n  suspension, December 2, 2010.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date of this\r\n  order, respondent shall enter into a payment plan with the Commission setting\r\n  forth the terms for repayment of costs.Â  Prior to petitioning for\r\n  reinstatement, respondent shall complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program\r\n  Ethics School and Trust Account School.Â  Further, as set forth in this order, respondent shall reimburse the complainants and/or\r\n  Lawyers' Fund prior to seeking reinstatement or returning to the active\r\n  practice of law.Â  Â \r\nThe facts,\r\n  as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn 2007, respondent\r\n  self-reported witnessing her former employer, a lawyer, violate several provisions\r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  Respondent reported that the lawyer's\r\n  violations occurred as early as 2004 and admits that her self-report in 2007\r\n  was untimely.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nWhile employed with\r\n  Complainant A's law firm, respondent settled an underinsured claim for a\r\n  client.Â  Respondent did not deposit the settlement draft in the law firm's\r\n  escrow account, but, instead, deposited the settlement in her personal bank\r\n  account and paid the client the entire share of the settlement from her\r\n  personal account.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent's office served a\r\n  legal notice entitled &quot;Application for Ejectment (Eviction)&quot; on\r\n  Complainant B's client.Â  The document appeared to be under the signature of a\r\n  magistrate.Â  Thereafter, respondent brought a Rule to Show Cause for ejectment\r\n  based on the document.Â  The court verified the document was neither issued by\r\n  the court nor the magistrate.\r\nRespondent represents the\r\n  document was her draft copy and that she had instructed her secretary to\r\n  prepare a proposed order with the information contained on the draft copy.Â \r\n  Respondent represents she was out of town for a funeral when the document was\r\n  executed.Â  Respondent further represents that the document was signed by her\r\n  secretary and then notarized and executed in her absence.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent had a trust\r\n  account with BB&amp;T Bank.Â  Respondent admits that, in early June 2010, checks\r\n  in the amount of $149.00 and $177.51 were presented against the account. Â The\r\n  trust account lacked sufficient funds to honor the checks.Â  Respondent admits\r\n  the checks were issued to pay non-client related expenses.Â  \r\nOn June 15, 2010, a check in\r\n  the amount of $1,400.00 was presented against respondent's trust account.Â  The\r\n  trust account lacked sufficient funds to honor the check.Â  Respondent admits\r\n  the check was issued to pay a client, but the $1,400.00 used to pay the client\r\n  belonged to a different client.Â Â  Â \r\n\r\nODC served respondent with a\r\n  subpoena requesting copies of all of her trust account records required to be\r\n  maintained pursuant to Rule 417, SCACR , for the period between June 1, 2009,\r\n  and June 31, 2010.Â  By letter dated February 24, 2011, ODC again requested the\r\n  documents.Â  To date, respondent has not furnished any trust account records.Â  \r\nRespondent represents she\r\n  failed to maintain records as required by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  In particular,\r\n  respondent failed to maintain receipt and disbursement journals, ledger\r\n  records, bills, disbursement sheets, checkbook registers or check stubs, bank\r\n  statements, records of deposit, and monthly reconciliation statements.Â  Further,\r\n  respondent admits that she failed to reconcile her trust account and, in that\r\n  regard, also failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent represented\r\n  Complainant C in a Workers' Compensation action that was settled in March\r\n  2009.Â  The agreement was approved by the Workers' Compensation Commission.Â  The\r\n  terms of the agreement provided that Complainant C would receive a lump sum\r\n  payment of $20,000.00 and weekly payments of $533.44 for one hundred and eleven\r\n  (111) weeks directly from the State Accident Fund, in addition to other\r\n  payments for a total award of $120,000.00.Â  Â Â \r\nIn error, the State Accident\r\n  Fund issued a check to respondent for the total amount of $120,000.00.Â \r\n  Respondent deposited the $120,000.00 check directly into her checking account\r\n  and paid Complainant C the $20,000.00 lump sum as outlined in the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Agreement.Â  Respondent retained the $100,000.00 balance in her\r\n  checking account.Â  From April 2009 until February 2010, respondent made weekly\r\n  deposits into Complainant C's bank account.Â  Many of the weekly payments were untimely.Â Â \r\n  Â Â Â Â  \r\nBeginning in March 2010,\r\n  respondent began making monthly deposits into Complainant C's bank account.Â \r\n  The monthly payments were inconsistent in date paid and in amount paid.Â  One\r\n  payment in the amount of $1,400.00 was returned by the bank for insufficient\r\n  funds.Â  The check was written on respondent's trust account and was paid using\r\n  funds belonging to another client.Â  \r\nRespondent led Complainant C\r\n  to believe the payments into Complainant C's bank account were coming directly\r\n  from the State Accident Fund when in fact it was respondent who was depositing\r\n  the payments into Complainant C's account.Â  Ultimately, respondent paid $56,448.90\r\n  of the $58,778.50 owed to Complainant C.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  provided false information and testimony to ODC regarding this matter.Â  In\r\n  respondent's written response to the complaint, respondent stated:\r\n\r\n  [Respondent]\r\n    denies that each week Complainant C has to call her about a payment but does\r\n    acknowledge that some weeks the payments were late as customarily happens with\r\n    worker's comp carriers sending payments to claimants and [respondent] further\r\n    states that each week she did everything possible to assist claimant in getting\r\n    her payment received as expeditiously as possible.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent\r\n  also stated:\r\n\r\n  The carrier\r\n    did decide to go to a monthly schedule in April 2010 and I understand some\r\n    months they have paid on time and some months they have been a few days late\r\n    and again when they are late and [respondent] has received a call from\r\n    Complainant C, she has done everything possible to assist claimant in getting\r\n    her payment received as expeditiously as possible.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent was issued a\r\n  Notice to Appear and give testimony under oath.Â  In respondent's first\r\n  appearance, she initially denied that she ever received a check from the State\r\n  Accident Fund in the amount of $120,000.00.Â  During the same interview, she\r\n  later acknowledged that she had received the $120,000.00 check, but stated she\r\n  instructed her secretary to return the check to the State Accident Fund.Â \r\n  Respondent denied negotiating the check.Â  \r\nIn a separate interview, ODC\r\n  presented a copy of the executed $120,000.00 check.Â  Respondent then admitted\r\n  under oath that she had received, endorsed, and deposited the check into her\r\n  checking account.Â  Respondent also endorsed Complainant's C's name on the\r\n  check.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent had a trust\r\n  account with BB&amp;T Bank.Â  She admits that, on or about October 19, 2010,\r\n  checks in the amount of $8.31, $30.21, $80.12, and $120.82 were presented\r\n  against her trust account.Â  At the time the checks were presented, the trust\r\n  account lacked sufficient funds to honor the checks.Â  Respondent admits that\r\n  the checks were issued to pay non-client related expenses.Â  \r\nOn October 26, 2010, checks\r\n  in the amount of $30.21, $80.12, and $120.82 were presented against the trust\r\n  account.Â  The trust account lacked sufficient funds to honor the checks.Â \r\n  Respondent represented the $80.12 and $120.82 checks had been renegotiated by\r\n  the bank in an attempt to honor the checks presented on October 19, 2010.Â \r\n  Respondent admits the $30.21 check was issued to pay a non-client related\r\n  expense.Â \r\n\r\nOn November 16, 2010, three\r\n  checks in the amount of $30.00 each were presented against respondent's trust\r\n  account.Â  At the time of presentment, the account lacked sufficient funds to\r\n  honor the checks.Â  Respondent admits these checks were issued to pay non-client\r\n  related expenses.Â  \r\nReview of respondent's trust\r\n  account statements from BB&amp;T Bank revealed numerous checks written to\r\n  &quot;cash&quot; in amounts ranging from $149.00 to $3,500.00 and numerous\r\n  account transfers from respondent's trust account to respondent's checking\r\n  account in amounts ranging from $300.00 to $4,600.00.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent represented\r\n  Complainant D in a Workers' Compensation action that was settled in June\r\n  2010.Â Â  On or about August 17, 2010, respondent was issued a check from the\r\n  State Accident Fund in the amount of $60,000.00.Â  Respondent endorsed her name\r\n  and Complainant D's name on the check and then deposited the funds into her\r\n  trust account.Â  Respondent endorsed Complainant D's name without Complainant\r\n  D's knowledge or consent.Â  \r\nRespondent failed to pay\r\n  Complainant D any of the $60,000 settlement proceeds.Â  Instead, respondent used\r\n  the funds belonging to Complainant D for respondent's personal benefit and the\r\n  benefit of other clients.Â  \r\nBy letter dated December 9,\r\n  2010, respondent was issued a Notice of Investigation and a request for a\r\n  response within fifteen (15) days.Â  When no response was received, ODC sent\r\n  respondent a &quot;Treacy&quot;[1] letter by certified mail which requested an immediate response to the Notice of\r\n  Investigation.Â  To date, respondent has failed to submit a written response to\r\n  the Notice of Investigation. \r\nMatter VIII\r\nOn October 10, 2010, respondent\r\n  and a co-defendant were arrested and charged with distribution or possession\r\n  with intent to distribute a Schedule IV drug, possession of prescription\r\n  medication in an unlabeled container, possession of less than one gram of meth\r\n  or cocaine base, and open container.Â  Additionally, respondent was charged with\r\n  driving under the influence, 1st offense.Â  \r\nOn October 11, 2010, respondent\r\n  pled guilty to the driving under the influence and open container charges.Â \r\n  Respondent was allowed to enroll in a Pre-Trial Intervention Program on the\r\n  charges of distribution or possession with intent to distribute a Schedule IV\r\n  drug, possession of prescription medication in an unlabeled container, and\r\n  possession of less than one gram of meth or cocaine base.Â  Respondent has now\r\n  successfully completed a Pre-Trial Intervention Program.Â  Â Â \r\nMatter IX\r\nRespondent represented\r\n  Complainant E in a civil dispute between Complainant E and her neighbor.Â  In\r\n  March 2010, respondent wrote a letter to Complainant E's neighbor.Â  Complainant\r\n  E then requested respondent file an action against the neighbor.Â  \r\nOn March 30, 2010, Complainant\r\n  E paid respondent $190.00, representing court costs and filing fees, to file\r\n  the action.Â  Respondent did not file the action.Â  Respondent did not expedite\r\n  the case as requested by Complainant E.Â  Respondent failed to adequately communicate\r\n  with Complainant E regarding the status of the case and failed to promptly\r\n  respondent to Complainant E's requests for copies of documents.Â  Respondent did\r\n  request the attorney appointed to protect the interests of her clients pursuant\r\n  to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, refund $190.00 from respondent's expense\r\n  account following the filing of the complaint.&nbsp; \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by her misconduct, she\r\n  has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall\r\n    act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule\r\n  1.4 (lawyer shall keep client\r\n    reasonably informed about the status of matter and promptly comply with\r\n    reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold funds belonging to clients or third\r\n  persons separately from lawyer's personal account; lawyer shall maintain funds\r\n  belonging to clients and third parties on deposit in trust account; upon\r\n  receiving funds in which third person has an interest, lawyer shall promptly\r\n  deliver funds to the third person); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable\r\n  efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of client); Rule 4.1 (in\r\n  course of representing client, lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement\r\n  of material fact to a third person); Rule 5.3 (lawyer who possesses managerial\r\n  authority in law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has\r\n  in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that non-lawyer's conduct is\r\n  compatible with professional obligations of lawyer); Rule 8.1(a) (in connection\r\n  with disciplinary matter, lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement of\r\n  material fact); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful\r\n  demand for information from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.3 (lawyer who knows\r\n  that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty,\r\n  trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the\r\n  appropriate professional authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct\r\n  for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely\r\n  on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other\r\n  respects); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in\r\n  conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule\r\n  8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is\r\n  prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent further admits she\r\n  violated the financial recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  In\r\n  addition, she admits she wrote checks payable to &quot;cash&quot; on her trust\r\n  account and failed to perform monthly reconciliations of her trust account,\r\n  both in violation of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Â Â \r\nRespondent admits her misconduct is grounds for discipline\r\n  under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be\r\n  ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct),\r\n  Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail to\r\n  comply with a subpoena issued under Rule 413, SCACR, or knowingly fail to\r\n  respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority to include a request\r\n  for a response), and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring\r\n  the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an\r\n  unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and\r\n  disbar respondent from the practice of law, retroactively to the date of her\r\n  interim suspension.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall enter into a payment plan with the Commission for repayment of\r\n  costs incurred by ODC and the Commission in the investigation and prosecution\r\n  of this matter. \r\nPrior to seeking reinstatement, respondent shall complete\r\n  the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account School.Â  Prior\r\n  to seeking reinstatement or returning to the active practice of law, respondent\r\n  shall reimburse Complainant C $2,329.60 and shall reimburse Complainant D\r\n  $60,000.00.Â  If Complainant C and/or Complainant D are reimbursed by the\r\n  Lawyers' Fund, the amount due the complainants shall be reduced accordingly, and\r\n  respondent shall reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for its payments to the\r\n  complainants prior to seeking reinstatement or returning to the active practice\r\n  of law.Â  \r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has\r\n  complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender her\r\n  Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]

Â Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes\r\n  grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline\r\n  for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public\r\n  reprimand with conditions.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  Respondent\r\n  shall:Â  1) fully comply with the terms of his current contract with LHL which\r\n  was renewed in October 2010; 2) submit an affidavit to ODC attesting to his\r\n  compliance with the terms of his contract with LHL every three months for a\r\n  period of one year from the date of this order; 3) submit statements to ODC from\r\n  his medical treatment provider and his LHL monitor attesting to his compliance\r\n  with his LHL contract every three months for a period of one year from the date\r\n  of this order; 4) submit his affidavit to ODC attesting to completion of the\r\n  terms of the LHL contract one year after the date of this order; 5) submit to\r\n  ODC a letter signed by his LHL monitor and a representative of the South\r\n  Carolina Bar responsible for administration of LHL confirming respondent's\r\n  completion with the terms of his LHL contract one year after the date of this\r\n  order; 6) submit a letter to ODC signed by respondent's medical treatment\r\n  provider confirming respondent's compliance with his treatment program and\r\n  providing his prognosis and plan for future treatment, if any, one year from\r\n  the date of this order; 7) allow an investigative panel to review this matter\r\n  one year after the date of this order and to unilaterally extend the above six\r\n  conditions for one additional year; 8) bear all costs of compliance with the terms\r\n  of the Agreement and to be personally responsible for obtaining and submitting\r\n  the required documentation; and 9) pay the costs incurred by ODC and the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) in the investigation and\r\n  prosecution of this matter within thirty (30) days of the date of this order.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27059","title":"Holmes v.

Nat'l Servs.\r\n    Indus., Op. No. 2009-UP-364 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 25, 2009).[1]Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner began\r\n  working for respondent National Service Industries (&quot;National&quot;), a\r\n  linen company, at its Charleston laundering facility in August 1984.Â  According\r\n  to petitioner, the work environment at the facility was &quot;very hot&quot;\r\n  and &quot;sticky&quot; with &quot;a lot of lint and dust in the air,&quot; and\r\n  was poorly ventilated.Â  Petitioner was exposed to the fumes of bleach and did\r\n  not wear a protective mask.\r\nIn 1992, petitioner\r\n  began experiencing breathing and sinus problems.Â  Petitioner never experienced\r\n  breathing or sinus problems prior to working for National.Â  Petitioner's\r\n  breathing was &quot;good&quot; when she was away from work.Â  In 1993, National\r\n  transferred petitioner to its Atlanta facility where the working conditions\r\n  were worse than in the Charleston facility.Â  Petitioner ultimately left her\r\n  employment with National because the working conditions were making her\r\n  breathing problems worse.\r\nIn 1995,\r\n  petitioner visited Dr. Jefrey Lieberman, who diagnosed petitioner as suffering\r\n  from sarcoidosis, a respiratory and pulmonary condition.Â  Petitioner testified\r\n  Dr. Lieberman told her he did not know what caused her sarcoidosis and that, in\r\n  light of this statement, she took no further steps to determine the cause of\r\n  her condition.\r\nIn July 2005, petitioner\r\n  visited Dr. Michael Spandorfer.Â  Dr. Spandorfer stated in his report that it\r\n  was unclear whether petitioner's work exposure at National caused her\r\n  sarcoidosis, but that it was more likely that petitioner's exposure to the\r\n  airborne particles and fumes worsened her condition, which had previously\r\n  developed. \r\nPetitioner filed\r\n  a workers' compensation claim alleging a compensable injury by accident to her\r\n  lungs and respiratory system arising out of and in the scope of her employment\r\n  with National on July 12, 2005, the date she alleges she first discovered her\r\n  sarcoidosis was related to her employment.\r\nThe single\r\n  commissioner found petitioner sustained a compensable injury by accident to her\r\n  lungs which was discovered on July 12, 2005.\r\nThe full\r\n  commission reversed the commissioner, finding petitioner's claim was barred by\r\n  the two-year statute of limitations.Â  Specifically, the full commission found\r\n  petitioner was aware of her working conditions and, with some diligence on her\r\n  part, could have discovered she had a claim more than two years before her\r\n  filing date.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  appealed.Â  The circuit court and Court of Appeals, pursuant to Rule 220(b),\r\n  SCACR, affirmed the full commission's determination that petitioner failed to\r\n  file her claim within the statute of limitations.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn workers' compensation\r\n  cases, the Commission is the ultimate fact finder.Â  Jordan v. Kelly Co., 381 S.C. 483, 674 S.E.2d 166 (2009).Â  An appellate court must affirm the\r\n  findings made by the Commission if they are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Pierre v. Seaside Farms, Inc., 386 S.C. 534, 540, 689 S.E.2d 615, 618\r\n  (2010).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but\r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds\r\n  to reach the conclusion the agency reached.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The substantial\r\n  evidence test &quot;need not and must not be either judicial fact-finding or a\r\n  substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment;&quot; and a judgment\r\n  upon which reasonable men might differ will not be set aside.Â  Lark v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981) (quoting Dickinson-Tidewater,\r\n      Inc. v. Supervisor of Assess., 273 Md. 245, 329 A.2d 18, 25 (Md. 1974)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues the Court\r\n  of Appeals erred in holding substantial evidence in the record supported the\r\n  full commission's finding that petitioner's claim was barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe right to workers'\r\n  compensation for an injury by accident &quot;is barred unless a claim is filed\r\n  with the commission within two years after an accident . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 2010).\r\nUnder the discovery rule, the\r\n  statute of limitations begins to run from the date the claimant knew or should\r\n  have known that, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, a cause of action\r\n  exists.Â  Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 20, 416 S.E.2d\r\n  639, 640 (1992).\r\nWhether petitioner knew or\r\n  should have known that her sarcoidosis was related to her employment with\r\n  National over two years before filing her claim in 2005 is a question of fact\r\n  for the commission.Â  In our view, the Court of Appeals correctly held that substantial\r\n  evidence in the record supported the full commission's finding that\r\n  petitioner's claim was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Considering the record as a whole, there is\r\n  substantial evidence that would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion\r\n  that petitioner should have known she had a compensable injury when first\r\n  diagnosed with sarcoidosis.Â  Pierre, supra.Â  There is evidence\r\n  petitioner knew or should have known as early as 1992 her work environment was\r\n  negatively affecting her health. Â Petitioner testified she experienced\r\n  breathing problems and lesions when she was working at National's Charleston\r\n  facility.Â  Petitioner also testified her breathing was &quot;good&quot; when\r\n  she was away from work and that she ultimately left her employment with National\r\n  because the working conditions were making her breathing problems worse.Â  Although\r\n  reasonable minds may differ as to whether petitioner should have known after\r\n  being diagnosed with sarcoidosis that she had a compensable injury, this is not\r\n  sufficient to set aside the judgment of the Appellate Panel.Â  Lark, supra.\r\nWe requested the parties\r\n  address whether the commission's findings regarding compensability and\r\n  causation are the law of the case.Â  Because we affirm the Court of Appeals'\r\n  opinion regarding the statute of limitations issue, we decline to address this\r\n  issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\n  S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) (when one issue is dispositive, the remaining\r\n  issues need not be addressed).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals correctly found there was substantial evidence in the record to support\r\n  the full commission's findings that petitioner's claim was barred by the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Accordingly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J., and Acting\r\n  Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concur.Â  BEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion in which Acting Justice James E. Moore, concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  I respectfully dissent,\r\n  as I believe the substantial evidence in the record demonstrates Carolyn\r\n  Holmes's claim for workers' compensation benefits was filed within two years of\r\n  the date she knew or reasonably should have known that she had sustained a compensable injury.Â  It is not the mere existence of the injury, but also the\r\n  reasonable discovery of its compensable nature, i.e., the nexus between\r\n  the injury and the claimant's employment, that is required to trigger the\r\n  running of the statute of limitations.Â  Holmes saw no fewer than half a dozen\r\n  different doctors, none of whom related her ongoing medical problems to her\r\n  employment until 2005, and Holmes timely filed her claim two months\r\n  thereafter.Â  Holmes, as a layperson, should not be held to a higher degree of\r\n  medical skill than her treating physicians.Â  This is especially true in light\r\n  of the fact that medical experts universally acknowledge that sarcoidosis is a\r\n  rare condition of unknown etiology that can encompass a multitude of seemingly\r\n  unrelated symptoms.Â  The discovery and evaluation of this complex condition is\r\n  uniquely difficult, so a review of the events leading to Holmes's claim is\r\n  illustrative.\r\nI.\r\nNational Service Industries,\r\n  Inc. (&quot;National&quot;) is a holding company for National Linen Service\r\n  Corp., a textile rental business that supplies towels, washcloths, and sheets\r\n  to hotels and restaurants.Â  Holmes began working for National at its Charleston\r\n  laundering facility in August 1984.Â  It is undisputed that the building was\r\n  very hot and poorly ventilated, and the air contained a large amount of dust,\r\n  lint, and chemical fumes.Â  National provided hair nets to its employees, but did\r\n  not offer dust masks or any other form of respiratory protection.\r\nIn 1992, approximately eight\r\n  years after Holmes began working for National, she began to have breathing and\r\n  sinus problems, and some lesions appeared on her skin.Â  Holmes took over-the-counter\r\n  medications that seemed to help. Â The relief was short-lived, however, and\r\n  Holmes eventually sought medical care before transferring to another National\r\n  facility in Atlanta in 1993.Â  Holmes's symptoms worsened, and she left National\r\n  in 1994 after working at the Atlanta location for six months.\r\nHolmes next worked for United\r\n  Parcel Service for a year, and then worked for six months at the Shepherd\r\n  Center, a rehabilitation hospital.Â  During this time, Holmes's sinus issues\r\n  remained the same.Â  In 1995, during her tenure at Shepherd, Holmes sought\r\n  treatment at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta.Â  The medical staff there diagnosed\r\n  her as having allergy and sinus conditions and provided treatment in accordance\r\n  with this diagnosis. \r\nHolmes's symptoms persisted,\r\n  so she again sought treatment and was seen later in 1995 by Dr. Jefrey D.\r\n  Lieberman.Â  Dr. Lieberman noted Holmes was suffering at that time from\r\n  congestion with bloody drainage, &quot;lumps&quot; on various parts of her\r\n  legs, upper arms, and left cheek, and changes in pigmentation on her face.Â  Dr.\r\n  Lieberman diagnosed Holmes for the first time as having sarcoidosis, a highly\r\n  variable, multi-systemic autoimmune disorder, and opined that her skin\r\n  condition was indicative of the sarcoidosis and &quot;that her sinus symptoms\r\n  [were] secondary to the same process.&quot;Â  He placed her on a course of\r\n  medication.Â  During this treatment, some of Holmes's symptoms improved.Â  Holmes\r\n  inquired as to the cause of her sarcoidosis and Dr. Lieberman told Holmes there\r\n  was no known cause.Â  He never advised her there was any possibility that it\r\n  could be work-related.Â  Holmes stated that, in light of Dr. Lieberman's\r\n  statement, she had no reason to believe her condition could be related to her\r\n  work.Â  Rather, it was her understanding that sarcoidosis was something that\r\n  &quot;just happen[s]&quot; or &quot;just comes.&quot; \r\nAfter working at Shepherd,\r\n  Holmes was employed by Oak Hill Farm, a wine distributor, where her sinus\r\n  symptoms continued unabated.Â  Holmes subsequently changed doctors, but none of\r\n  these doctors ever related her sarcoidosis to her employment. \r\nSince her initial symptoms, Holmes\r\n  had consulted at least half a dozen doctors before she was seen in 2005 by Dr. Michael\r\n  Spandorfer, of Charleston.Â  Although Dr. Spandorfer could not ascertain its\r\n  cause, he determined that Holmes's sarcoidosis was aggravated by her employment\r\n  with National from 1984 to 1994 and her exposure to airborne particulates and\r\n  fumes.Â  Dr. Spandorfer stated in a report dated July 12, 2005 that the work\r\n  conditions at National triggered what could have been a dormant sarcoidosis\r\n  condition.Â  Dr. Spandorfer also diagnosed Holmes with occupational-onset\r\n  asthma.Â  This was the first time that a medical professional had ever linked Holmes's\r\n  wide range of physical problems to her employment at National.Â  \r\nOn September 7, 2005, less\r\n  than two months after Dr. Spandorfer's evaluation, Holmes filed her workers'\r\n  compensation claim.Â  A single commissioner of the South Carolina Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission concluded Holmes sustained a compensable injury by\r\n  accident on July 12, 2005, &quot;the date o[n] which the Claimant reasonably\r\n  discovered the compensability of [her] injuries.&quot; \r\nIn a split decision (2-1),\r\n  the Appellate Panel reversed.Â  The Appellate Panel, noting it could make its\r\n  own findings of fact, found an employment relationship existed at the time of\r\n  Holmes's injury by accident and that the parties had stipulated the amount of\r\n  Holmes' average weekly wage and compensation rate.Â  It further found that\r\n  Holmes suffered from sarcoidosis and occupationally-induced asthma, &quot;which\r\n  was aggravated by, and whose development was contributed to by, her employment\r\n  and exposure to airborne dust, fumes, and particulate matter,&quot; and that\r\n  she will require ongoing medical treatment for her pulmonary injury.Â  However, the\r\n  Appellate Panel lastly found and concluded that Holmes's claim was,\r\n  nevertheless, barred by the two-year statute of limitations contained in\r\n  section 42-15-40 of the South Carolina Code.Â  \r\nThe dissenting member of the\r\n  Appellate Panel stated he would affirm the commissioner because throughout all\r\n  of her visits to physicians, none ever indicated Holmes's sarcoidosis or sinus\r\n  problems were related to her work at National until Dr. Spandorfer made this\r\n  determination in 2005.Â  Further, Dr. Lieberman told Holmes that he did not know\r\n  where her sarcoidosis came from, and there is no evidence in the record that\r\n  would indicate Holmes was negligent in relying on Dr. Lieberman's expert\r\n  medical opinion.Â  \r\nHolmes appealed, challenging\r\n  only the Appellate Panel's finding that the statute of limitations had run on\r\n  her claim.Â  She now appeals from the affirmance of the Court of Appeals.Â  Thus,\r\n  the only issue before this Court is the timeliness of Holmes's claim.\r\nII.\r\n&quot;Under the\r\n  discovery rule, the statute would begin to run from the date [the claimant]\r\n  either knew or should have known of her compensable injury.&quot;Â  Mauldin\r\n    v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 20, 416 S.E.2d 639, 640&nbsp;(1992)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The claimant's knowledge of an injury, in and of itself, is\r\n  not enough to commence the running of the statute of limitations.Â  Rather, the\r\n  claimant must also know or reasonably should have known that the injury is\r\n  compensable.Â  Compensability is the gravamen of the claim.Â  The claimant must\r\n  exercise reasonable diligence in discerning compensability.Â  See Snell\r\n    v. Columbia Gun Exch., Inc., 276 S.C. 301, 303, 278 S.E.2d 333,\r\n  334&nbsp;(1981) (&quot;The exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that\r\n  an injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and\r\n  circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and\r\n  experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim\r\n  against another party might exist.Â  The statute of limitations begins to run\r\n  from this point . . . .&quot;).\r\nThe alleged lack\r\n  of diligence by Holmes is the cornerstone of the Appellate Panel's finding that\r\n  the statute of limitation bars her claim.Â  The Appellate Panel found that\r\n  Holmes knew or reasonably should have known that she had a compensable injury\r\n  based on her sarcoidosis diagnosis in 1995.Â  Further, it found her knowledge of\r\n  her work conditions and her symptoms should have also alerted her to the\r\n  compensability of her injury.Â  \r\nIn my opinion, the substantial evidence in the record does not\r\n  support these findings.Â  Compensability requires a nexus between the injury and\r\n  the employment that is known, or reasonably should have been known, by the\r\n  claimant.Â  The requisite nexus between Holmes's sarcoidosis and her employment\r\n  at National could not have been known by Holmes before 2005, and she should not\r\n  be charged with this knowledge at a time when it was not even known by the many\r\n  medical experts who treated her.\r\nThe undisputed\r\n  facts establish that in 1995 Dr. Lieberman, while diagnosing Holmes with\r\n  sarcoidosis, failed to advise her of any causal relationship between her\r\n  condition and her work at National.Â  Instead, he told her that the cause of\r\n  sarcoidosis was unknown and that her breathing and sinus problems were\r\n  secondary to the sarcoidosis.Â  \r\nAs noted by the\r\n  dissenting member of the Appellate Panel, Holmes was entitled to rely upon Dr.\r\n  Lieberman's expert medical opinion.Â  The mere diagnosis of her sarcoidosis\r\n  condition, without more, does not give rise to a compensable injury under our\r\n  workers' compensation law, and Holmes could not simply assume the condition was\r\n  work related in the absence of expert medical evidence.Â  See Mauldin,\r\n  308 S.C. at 20, 416 S.E.2d at 640 (stating a workers' compensation claim must\r\n  be for a &quot;compensable&quot; injury); cf. Hanks v. Blair Mills,\r\n    Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 335 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1985) (observing there are\r\n  &quot;non-compensable causes&quot; that can accelerate or aggravate an\r\n  occupational illness).Â  Based on Dr. Lieberman's statement, a reasonable person\r\n  would have believed that sarcoidosis is a malady, not unlike cancer, whose\r\n  occurrence is both unfortunate and unpredictable.[2]\r\nDr. Lieberman's\r\n  medical opinion is consistent with existing medical knowledge, which universally\r\n  recognizes that sarcoidosis is a rare condition whose etiology is unknown by\r\n  medical experts, that it can affect any organ in the body, and that its\r\n  symptoms are highly variable from patient to patient.Â  SeeÂ  Booker v.\r\n    Int'l Rivercenter, 905 So. 2d 498, 502 (La. Ct. App. 2005) (noting a\r\n  physician's testimony that sarcoidosis has no known cause); Hatem v. Bryan,\r\n  453 S.E.2d 199, 200 (N.C. Ct. App. 1995) (stating the plaintiff &quot;suffered\r\n  from sarcoidosis, a chronic disease process of unknown cause which may affect\r\n  any organ or tissue of the body&quot;).\r\nIt is also\r\n  consistent with the fact that Dr. Spandorfer, likewise, was unable to\r\n  definitively state the origin of Holmes's sarcoidosis in 2005.Â  However, Dr.\r\n  Spandorfer was, in contrast to Dr. Lieberman and Holmes's prior physicians,\r\n  able to discern a link between what might have been a dormant underlying\r\n  condition and Holmes's employment at National in his report of July 12, 2005.Â  In\r\n  addition, July 12, 2005 is the first date Holmes was advised by Dr. Spandorfer that\r\n  she also suffered from occupationally-induced asthma related to her work at\r\n  National.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe record as a\r\n  whole indicates that the variety of complex symptoms Holmes experienced, such\r\n  as the respiratory problems, lumps, skin lesions, changes in skin pigmentation,\r\n  joint pain, and swelling of the lower extremities, among others, were all\r\n  within the wide range of symptoms that can arise with sarcoidosis. At the same\r\n  time, these symptoms were also indistinguishable from many other maladies.Â \r\n  Merely being aware of her sarcoidosis symptoms would not alert Holmes to the\r\n  compensability of her injury, especially when her treating physician told her\r\n  sarcoidosis has no known cause and that her symptoms were secondary to the\r\n  disease itself.Â  Moreover, although Holmes commented at one point that her symptoms\r\n  seemed to temporarily improve when she was away from work, Holmes also\r\n  testified that her symptoms temporarily improved when she began taking\r\n  over-the-counter medications, but ultimately, the symptoms persisted, even as\r\n  she changed employers and work environments.Â  Consequently, there was no definitive\r\n  pattern to her condition.\r\nThe unique\r\n  character of sarcoidosis undoubtedly made it more difficult for the medical\r\n  experts to analyze as compared to conditions that uniformly manifest specific\r\n  symptoms in a localized area.Â  The fact that the current state of medical\r\n  knowledge ascribes no known cause for this condition also proved to be an\r\n  impediment to Holmes's physicians relating her sarcoidosis to her employment\r\n  until it had progressed to the point where the connection was made by Dr.\r\n  Spandorfer.Â  Holmes went to a variety of physicians seeking medical treatment\r\n  for her evolving array of symptoms.Â  As a layperson, Holmes should not be\r\n  penalized for, in essence, failing to detect what her own treating physicians\r\n  had failed to discover prior to 2005.Â  Cf. Youngblood v. U.S. Silica\r\n    Co., 130 S.W.3d 461 (Tex. App. 2004) (reversing the grant of summary\r\n  judgment based on the two-year statute of limitations and finding the fact that\r\n  the employee continued to visit doctors from 1992 to 1997 was some evidence\r\n  that he exercised reasonable diligence in ascertaining the cause of his\r\n  silicosis and the employee did not discover his illness was work related and\r\n  could not have assumed it was work related prior to the time he was so informed\r\n  by a doctor in 1997).\r\nÂ Based on the foregoing,\r\n  I would hold Holmes's claim regarding her sarcoidosis condition was filed\r\n  within two years of when she knew or reasonably should have known that she had sustained\r\n  a compensable injury.Â  In addition, while the Appellate Panel found\r\n  Holmes knew of her sarcoidosis diagnosis in 1995, there has been no allegation\r\n  or finding that Holmes's occupationally-induced asthma existed at the time her\r\n  sarcoidosis was diagnosed.Â  Rather, it subsequently developed as Holmes's\r\n  health problems progressed and was diagnosed in 2005.Â  The Appellate Panel's\r\n  discussion regarding the statute of limitations focused only on the timing of\r\n  Holmes's sarcoidosis diagnosis and her alleged failure to timely determine the\r\n  relation of her sarcoidosis to her employment.Â  The diagnosis of Holmes's\r\n  sarcoidosis has no bearing on her later-developed asthma.Â  Holmes's claim\r\n  regarding her asthma was timely asserted within two years of when she knew or\r\n  reasonably should have known she had a compensable injury in this regard.\r\nThe Court observed\r\n  in Mauldin that statutes of limitation should not be applied\r\n  mechanically, but in a manner consistent with both their underlying purposes\r\n  and the need to provide substantial justice to all parties.Â  Mauldin,\r\n  308 S.C. at 21, 416 S.E.2d at 640.Â  The desire to protect defendants from false\r\n  or fraudulent claims &quot;must be balanced against a plaintiff's interest in\r\n  prosecuting an action and pursuing [her] rights.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;Plaintiffs should not suffer where circumstances prevent them from\r\n  knowing they have been harmed.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The statute of\r\n  limitations applicable to workers' compensation claims, like the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Act as a whole, should be given liberal construction, and any\r\n  reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.&quot;Â  Rogers v.\r\n    Spartanburg Reg'l Med. Ctr., 328 S.C. 415, 418, 491 S.E.2d 708,\r\n  710&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).\r\nAllowing Holmes\r\n  to recover for her injuries is consistent with the underlying purpose and\r\n  objectives of the statute of limitations.Â  Holmes's appeal presents an unusual\r\n  case of a claimant with a rare condition; there is no allegation of a false or\r\n  fraudulent claim and National has not been disadvantaged in its ability to\r\n  evaluate the validity of the claim.Â  As this Court has previously held, any\r\n  doubts regarding the statute of limitations should be resolved in favor of\r\n  coverage.Â  This principle is particularly relevant in light of the fact that\r\n  the Appellate Panel was itself divided on the statute of limitations issue.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nHaving determined\r\n  Holmes's claim is not time-barred, I would further hold the unchallenged\r\n  factual findings of the Appellate Panel as to the compensability of Holmes's\r\n  claim and her stipulated compensation rate are the law of the case.Â  Therefore,\r\n  I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to\r\n  the Commission for it to reinstate the order of the single commissioner. \r\nActingÂ  Justice James E.\r\n  Moore, concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This Court has corrected the spelling of the employer's name to &quot;National\r\n  Service Industries&quot; (rather than &quot;National Services Industries&quot;)\r\n  in the caption.\r\n[2] &quot;Logically, an\r\n  employee cannot be expected and certainly cannot be required to institute a\r\n  claim until he has reliable information that his condition is the result of his\r\n  employment.&quot;Â  Sellers v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 752 S.W.2d\r\n  413, 416&nbsp;(Mo. Ct. App. 1988), overruled on other grounds by Hampton\r\n    v. Big Boy Steel Erection, 121 S.W.3d 220 (Mo. 2003).Â  &quot;Just as\r\n  logically, given that there must be competent and substantial evidence of this\r\n  link, the claimant is entitled to rely on a physician's diagnosis of his\r\n  condition rather than his own impressions.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27060","title":"Burch v.

Small, Jr. who owns Avtex\r\n  Commercial Property, Inc. (Avtex), a real estate development company.Â  Husband\r\n  and Small agreed to share ownership with each other in deals that Husband\r\n  brought to Avtex and also decided that each development project would be\r\n  structured under a separate limited liability company (LLC) designated Avtex\r\n  Partners I, Avtex Partners II, and so forth.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  appeal concerns two of those entities, Avtex Partners VI, LLC (&quot;Avtex\r\n  VI&quot;) and Avtex Partners VII, LLC (&quot;Avtex VII&quot;).Â  Husband owned a\r\n  25% interest in Avtex VI and Avtex VII, while Small retained a 65% interest,\r\n  and a third investor, Tom Fox, shared a 10% interest in the companies.Â  \r\nAvtex\r\n  VII's sole asset consisted of a development located in Charleston County known\r\n  as the Market at Oakland (Oakland).Â  Husband's largest contribution to the\r\n  project was setting up the initial meeting between Small and the owner of the\r\n  property, which led to an agreement in February 2003 to develop Oakland.Â  Small\r\n  financed 100% of the deal by taking out a personal loan, and he testified that\r\n  Husband's role in the Avtex VII project was limited: \r\n\r\nI have got to tell you\r\n  I didn't want [Husband] working on it . . . . Mount Pleasant is a very\r\n  difficult place to develop. And you can't have more than one voice out there .\r\n  . . . The politics down there are incredible.Â  So I asked him, you work on the\r\n  others, I will work on this.\r\n\r\n At the time of the\r\n  divorce filing, Avtex VII had yet to be developed, no lease had been signed,\r\n  and Husband claimed the property had zero equity value.Â  After the divorce\r\n  filing, Husband's participation in Avtex VII amounted to attending two trade\r\n  shows in Charlotte, North Carolina and Las Vegas, Nevada in March and May 2005,\r\n  respectively.Â  At both shows, Husband failed to attract any lessees for the\r\n  project.Â  \r\n In contrast, Small\r\n  secured the participation of Wal-Mart to anchor Oakland for Avtex VII, and in\r\n  September 2005, a lease agreement was entered into by the parties.Â  When asked\r\n  what role Husband played in the development of Avtex VII between January 2005\r\n  and September 2005, Small stated, &quot;I think his was more of a passive\r\n  role.&quot;Â  Around the same time, Husband and Small parted ways and Small bought\r\n  Husband's interest in Avtex VII for $1,591,500.Â  \r\n The Avtex VI development\r\n  project was a shopping center located on Forest Drive in Richland County.Â  At\r\n  the time of the divorce filing, a lease for Bonefish Grill, a restaurant chain,\r\n  was already in place.Â  After filing, Casual Living, a retail store, signed a\r\n  lease with Avtex VI.[3]Â \r\n  Subsequently, while the divorce was pending, Small also bought Husbandâ€™s\r\n  interest in Avtex VI.Â  \r\nWith\r\n  respect to Avtex VI, the family court allocated $254,920.35 as non-marital\r\n  assets and $194,730.82 as marital assets.Â  The family court also awarded the\r\n  marital home to Wife and directed Husband to make payments on the mortgage in\r\n  the amount of $3,982.80.Â  Husband did not tender the money in violation of the\r\n  court's order.Â  Instead, Wife advanced the payment and then sought\r\n  reimbursement, which the family court denied on equitable grounds, finding Wife\r\n  received a $54,279.66 windfall from refinancing the marital home.Â  \r\nIssues\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n       Whether the family court erred in\r\n  valuing Husband's interests in Avtex VI and VII at the filing date rather than\r\n  at a date occurring after the separation but before the divorce was final.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Whether the family court erred in\r\n  declining to require Husband to contribute to the expenses of Son's private\r\n  school education.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Whether the family court erred in\r\n  denying Wife reimbursement for an interest payment advanced by her.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      IV.&nbsp;\r\n       Whether the family court abused\r\n  its discretion in awarding $1,000 per month in child support.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      V.\r\n       Whether the family court properly\r\n  assessed attorney's fees against Wife.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On appeal from\r\n  the family court, this Court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with\r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dickert v.\r\n    Dickert, 387 S.C. 1, 6, 691 S.E.2d 448, 450 (2010) (citation omitted).Â  This\r\n  broad scope of review does not require the Court to disregard the findings of\r\n  the family court.Â  Id. (citation omitted). \r\nAnalysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Valuation\r\n  of Avtex VII\r\nPetitioner\r\n  contends the family court erred in valuing Avtex VII at the time of filing\r\n  rather than at a date occurring after a separation but before final divorce.Â \r\n  We agree. \r\nIn\r\n  South Carolina, marital property subject to equitable distribution is generally\r\n  valued at the divorce filing date.Â  Fuller v. Fuller, 370 S.C. 538,\r\n    545-48, 636 S.E.2d 636, 640 (Ct. App. 2006); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    20-3-630 (Supp. 2010) (&quot;'[M]arital\r\n  Property' as used in this article means all real and personal property which\r\n  has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of\r\n  the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation&quot;).Â  However, the\r\n  parties may be entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation in marital\r\n  assets occurring after a separation but before divorce.Â  McDavid v.\r\n    McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 497 n.7, 511 S.E.2d 365, 369 n.7 (1999); Fields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182,\r\n      186, 536 S.E.2d 684, 686 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  &quot;[G]iven the volume of cases handled by our family courts, there often is\r\n  a substantial delay between the commencement of an action and its ultimate\r\n  resolution.Â  Thus, it is not unusual for the value of marital assets to change,\r\n  sometimes substantially, between the time the action was commenced and its\r\n  final resolution.&quot;Â  Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222,\r\n    228, 512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  determining the proper date of valuation, other states examine whether there\r\n  has been &quot;active&quot; or &quot;passive&quot; appreciation or depreciation\r\n  of the marital assets.Â  See Mayhew v. Mayhew, 205 W. Va.\r\n    490, 519 S.E.2d 188 (W. Va. 1999); Greenwald v.\r\n      Greenwald, 164 A.D.2d 706, 565 N.Y.S. 494 (N.Y. 1991); In re Marriage\r\n        of Wagner, 208 Mont. 369, 679 P.2d 753 (Mont. 1984); Brackney v.\r\n          Brackney, 199 N.C.

O'Brien,\r\n  131 N.C. App. 411, 420, 508 S.E.2d 365 (1999). See Lee's Family Law Â§ 12.52(b)(i)\r\n  (&quot;[P]assive forces include interest, inflation, market forces, government\r\n  action, [and] labor of third parties . . . .&quot;).Â  &quot;Active\r\n    appreciation,&quot; on the other hand, refers to &quot;financial or\r\n  managerial contributions&quot; of one of the spouses.Â  O'Brien, 131 N.C.\r\n  App. at 420, 508 S.E.2d at 306.

App.\r\n  at 385-86, 682 S.E.2d at 408 (emphasis\r\n  added). \r\nCourts\r\n  tend to value active appreciation or depreciation at the filing date to\r\n  encourage the parties to engage in productive economic activity and discourage waste\r\n  by allowing them to reap the reward of their labor and suffer the burden of\r\n  their dissipation.

App. 2004).Â \r\n  On the other hand, passive appreciation of marital property should be valued at\r\n  a post-filing date when equity requires that both spouses share in the fruits\r\n  of the marriage.Â  See, e.g., Fuller,\r\n    370 S.C. at 546, 636 S.E.2d at 640.Â \r\n  In making the public policy argument for the active and passive distinction it\r\n  has been said:\r\n\r\nIt is fairer to value a\r\n  passive asset at or near the time of the final hearing, because both parties\r\n  are equally deserving to share in any increase or decrease . . . . [On the\r\n  other hand,] active assets should be valued at the time of commencement [or\r\n  filing] of the marital litigation, to enable the person who causes the change\r\n  in value to receive the benefits of his or her labor and skills or, conversely,\r\n  to prevent the person who controls the assets from manipulating the value\r\n  downward during litigation.\r\n\r\nRoy T. Stuckey, Marital\r\n  Litigation in South Carolina 310 (3rd ed., 2001).\r\nWhile\r\n  this Court has never formally adopted the active and passive distinction, precedent\r\n  in our state supports its adoption.Â  In Bowman, the court of appeals noted\r\n  that &quot;passive post-filing changes in the appreciation or depreciation of\r\n  marital assets may be considered by the family court in determining an\r\n  equitable apportionment of the marital estate.&quot;Â  357 S.C. at 146,\r\n    591 S.E.2d at 660.Â  Moreover, without\r\n  using the precise language, our courts in practice have applied the active and\r\n  passive distinction in furtherance of equity and public policy.Â  See, e.g., Fuller,\r\n    370 S.C. at 546, 636 S.E.2d at 640 (finding an IRA account that passively increased in value should be valued at\r\n  the date of the final hearing rather than the divorce filing date); Bowman, 357 S.C. at\r\n    159, 594 S.E.2d at 660 (holding where\r\n  the husband actively and intentionally depleted his retirement account, the\r\n  account should be valued at the filing date); Dixon, 334 S.C. at\r\n    234, 512 S.E.2d at 545 (finding where\r\n  the husband actively set out to destroy his business during the marital\r\n  litigation, the proper valuation date for equitable division is the filing\r\n  date); Mallet v. Mallet, 323 S.C. 141,\r\n    151, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding where the husband's insurance business decreased passively because of\r\n  market forces, the proper valuation date was the date of the hearing rather\r\n  than the filing date).Â  In McDavid v. McDavid, this Court determined\r\n  that the increase in the equity of a marital home from the time of filing to\r\n  the time of trial stemmed from the reduction in the mortgage balance due solely\r\n  to payments made by the wife and not her husband.[4] 333 S.C. at 496,\r\n    511 S.E.2d at 368.Â  In other words,\r\n  the wife's active contribution caused the appreciation in the equity of\r\n  the marital home, and we determined the valuation date should be the date of\r\n  filing.Â  Id.\r\nApplying\r\n  the active and passive distinction in the present case, we find that\r\n  appreciation in value of Avtex VII that occurred post-filing does not cross the\r\n  threshold from passive to active.Â  Husband's only real contribution to the\r\n  Avtex VII project was to arrange the initial meeting between Small and the\r\n  landowners.Â  However, Husband made this contribution during the marriage so any\r\n  value derived from it was marital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    20-3-630 (Supp. 2010) (&quot;The term\r\n  'marital property' as used in this article means all real and personal property\r\n  which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage&quot;).Â  Husband\r\n  claimed Avtex VII had no value at the time of filing because the equity value\r\n  of the property was zero.[5]Â \r\n  Assuming this proposition is true, only Husband's post-filing activities matters. \r\n In this regard, the\r\n  Record indicates that Husband's post-filing contribution was minimal, if any.Â \r\n  Small financed 100% of the deal by taking out a personal loan, and Small\r\n  testified that he purposely restricted Husband's role in the Avtex VII\r\n  project.Â  In addition, neither party contests that the Wal-Mart lease was the\r\n  primary cause of the increase in the value of Avtex VII.Â  The acquisition of\r\n  the lease and the subsequent appreciation of the property was attributable to\r\n  Small alone, and as Small testified, Husband played a &quot;passive role&quot;\r\n  from January 2005 (the filing date) to September 2005 (the lease date). Husband's\r\n  participation in the Avtex VII project amounted to attending two trade shows\r\n  where he failed to attract any lessees or add value to the project.Â \r\n  Consequently, the appreciation resulted from the labor of a third party.Â  See Brackney,\r\n    199 N.C.App. at 385-86, 682 S.E.2d at 408 (citing with approval a definition of passive appreciation that includes\r\n  &quot;labor of a third party&quot;).Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  these facts, Husband's involvement does not cross the threshold from passive to\r\n  active.[6]Â \r\n  Thus, we formally adopt the active and passive distinction and deem the\r\n  appreciation of Avtex VII passive, and value the property at the buyout date of\r\n  the property rather than the filing date.Â  Furthermore, we order that the\r\n  passive gain be split fifty/fifty between the parties.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Valuation\r\n  of Avtex VI\r\nWith\r\n  respect to Avtex VI, the family court allocated $254,920.35 as a non-marital\r\n  asset and $194,730.82 as a marital asset subject to equitable division in\r\n  recognition of Husband's contribution in acquiring the Casual Living lease.Â  By\r\n  statute, marital property subject to equitable distribution is by default\r\n  valued at the date of the divorce filing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    20-3-630 (Supp. 2010).Â  While our\r\n  jurisprudence has carved out exceptions to this rule, the burden of proof is\r\n  properly on the party seeking a deviation from the statutory filing date. Â See Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 56, 126 S. Ct. 528, 534 (2005) (&quot;The burdens of\r\n  pleading and proof with regard to most facts have and should be assigned to the\r\n  plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who\r\n  therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure or proof or\r\n  persuasion&quot;) (quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence Â§\r\n  337, p. 412 (5th ed. 1999)). \r\nHere,\r\n  the burden of proof is on Wife to show Husband's activity is passive because\r\n  she seeks a deviation.Â  However, the Record is insufficiently\r\n  developed to classify Husband's contribution to the acquisition of the Casual\r\n  Living lease as passive.Â  Thus, Wife fails to meet her burden of proof, and we\r\n  affirm the family court's decision as to Avtex VI.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Sonâ€™s Private School\r\n  Education\r\nWife\r\n  claims the family court erred in declining to require Husband to contribute to\r\n  the expenses of Sonâ€™s private school education.Â  We agree.\r\nSection\r\n  63-5-20(A) of the South Carolina Code entitled &quot;Obligation to Support&quot; requires a\r\n  divorced person to &quot;provide a living standard for the [child]\r\n  substantially equal to that of the person owing the duty to support.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    63-5-20(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  In Miller v. Miller, this Court reiterated\r\n  that family courts should &quot;award support in an amount sufficient to\r\n  provide for the needs of the children and to maintain the children at the\r\n  standard of living they would have been provided but for the divorce.&quot;Â  299 S.C. 307,\r\n    312, 384 S.E.2d 715, 717 (1989).Â \r\n  This may include contributing to private school expenses where appropriate.Â  See Rabon v.\r\n    Rabon, 288 S.C. 338, 340, 342 S.E.2d 605, 606 (1986) (ordering an increase in child support to cover\r\n  private school tuition because &quot;the children would benefit from enrollment\r\n  at a [private school,] . . . . [f]ather [was] in good health, earn[ed] a high\r\n  income and [was] capable of meeting the increased expenses&quot;); LaFrance v.\r\n    LaFrance, 370 S.C. 622, 657, 636 S.E.2d 3, 22 (Ct. App. 2006), overruled on other grounds by Arnal v. Arnal, 371 S.C. 10,\r\n      636 S.E.2d 864&nbsp;(2006) (requiring\r\n  the husband to contribute fifty-seven percent to child's private school tuition\r\n  because the parties historically placed the child in private school, it was in\r\n  the best interest of the child, and it was within the financial ability of the\r\n  husband).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Son has attended Heathwood Hall since kindergarten, and the Record does not suggest it\r\n  would be detrimental or against the child's best interest to continue to attend\r\n  Heathwood Hall.Â  Rabon, 288 S.C. at\r\n    340, 342 S.E.2d at 606; LaFrance, 370 S.C. at\r\n      657, 636 S.E.2d at 22.Â  We see no reason here to upset the status quo.Â  Given\r\n  Husband's income and high standard of living, Husband can afford to contribute\r\n  approximately $6,000 towards Son's private education &quot;to maintain [Son] at\r\n  the standard of living [he] would have been provided but for the\r\n  divorce.&quot;Â  Miller, 299 S.C. at\r\n    312, 384 S.E.2d at 717; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    63-5-20(A). \r\nThus,\r\n  we reverse the family court and order Husband to contribute fifty percent of\r\n  the cost of Sonâ€™s tuition at Heathwood Hall.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Reimbursement\r\n  for Delinquent Payment\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred in denying reimbursement for a delinquent payment\r\n  advanced by Wife.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder\r\n  a temporary court order, the family court directed Husband to pay $3,982.80 on\r\n  the mortgage on the marital home.Â  Husband did not tender the money, so Wife\r\n  made the payment.Â  When Wife sought reimbursement, the family court denied her\r\n  request, noting that the stipulated payoff for the first mortgage at trial was\r\n  $299,197, and Wife refinanced the mortgage with a payoff of $244,918.34.Â  In\r\n  the family court's view, Wife received a $54,279.66 windfall because the court\r\n  relied on the stipulated amount to fashion an equitable apportionment of the\r\n  marital property.Â  Accordingly, the family court concluded that the amount of\r\n  delinquent interest owed by the Husband should be absolved as a matter of\r\n  equity.\r\n In\r\n  considering whether the family court erred, it is settled law in South Carolina\r\n  that &quot;[c]ourts have the inherent power to do all things reasonably\r\n  necessary to insure that just results are reached to the fullest extent\r\n  possible.&quot;Â  Buckley v.\r\n    Shealy, 370 S.C. 317, 323-24, 635 S.E.2d 76, 79 (2006) (citing Ex Parte Dibble, 279 S.C. 592,\r\n      595-96, 310 S.E.2d 440, 442 (Ct. App. 1983)).Â  Equally instructive is the equitable maxim that &quot;[one] who\r\n  seeks equity must do equity.&quot; Provident Life\r\n    &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 479, 451 S.E.2d 924, 929\r\n    (1994); Ingram v.\r\n      Kasey's Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 107, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000).\r\n In\r\n  the present case, we need not decide whether Wife received a windfall in\r\n  refinancing the marital home.Â  In Buckley v. Shealy, this Court found\r\n  the family court erred in awarding the husband a set-off for overpaying child\r\n  support because the husband failed to make timely child support payments as\r\n  ordered.Â  370 S.C. at 325,\r\n    635 S.E.2d at 80.Â  Similarly, here,\r\n  Husband violated an explicit court order to make the mortgage payment on the\r\n  marital home.Â  Therefore, Husband is not entitled to have his obligation\r\n  absolved in equity since Husband did not act equitably in fulfilling his\r\n  obligation to the court and to Wife.Â  Id; Provident Life\r\n    &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 317 S.C. at 479, 451 S.E.2d at 929.\r\n Accordingly,\r\n  we reverse the family court and order Husband to pay Wife the delinquent\r\n  interest payment. \r\nV.&nbsp; Child\r\n  Support Payment\r\nWife\r\n  claims the family court abused its discretion in awarding $1,000 per month in\r\n  child support.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  determining whether or not to award child support, courts should consider both\r\n  parents': (1) incomes; (2) ability to pay; (3)\r\n  education; (4) expenses; (5) assets; and (6) the facts and circumstances\r\n  surrounding each case.Â  Holcombe v.\r\n    Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524-25, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991) (citing  Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 384 S.E.2d 715 (1989)).Â  Family court judges are generally required to\r\n  follow the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines (Guidelines) when awarding\r\n  child support.Â  Matter of\r\n    Bennett, 321 S.C. 485, 469 S.E.2d 608 (1996); see also  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n      63-17-470(A) (2010).\r\nThe\r\n  family court determined that Wife had an income of $10,418.16 per month and Husband\r\n  had an income of $6,792 per month.Â  Wife paid $119 per month to provide health\r\n  insurance for Son and $200 per month for babysitters.Â  Because Son spent 132\r\n  overnights annually with Husband, the family court classified the case as a\r\n  &quot;shared custody&quot; calculation under the Guidelines.Â  Under a\r\n  &quot;shared custody&quot; calculation under Worksheet C, Husband would be\r\n  required to pay only $181 per month in child support.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n    Regs. 114-4720, et. seq. (Supp. 2009).Â  Therefore, by requiring Husband to pay $1,000 per month, the family\r\n  court deviated upward and exercised its discretion to &quot;provide a living\r\n  standard for the [the child] substantially equal to that of the person owing\r\n  the duty to support.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    63-5-20(A).\r\nIn\r\n  our view, the family court did not abuse its discretion, and we affirm.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees Assessed\r\n  Against Wife\r\nWife\r\n  asserts the family court improperly assessed attorney's fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  family court expressed frustration at Wife's non-cooperation and delay.[7]Â \r\n  After concluding that the &quot;positions taken by [Wife] were not reasonable\r\n  or appropriate,&quot; the court awarded Husband $3,250 in attorney's fees.Â  \r\nWife\r\n  asserts that the family court improperly relied on evidence of mediation in\r\n  violation of ADR Rule 8(a)(4) on confidentiality to award attorney's fees.[8]Â \r\n  Specifically, the family court found that &quot;the majority of the issues\r\n  brought before the Court by [Wife] were of such a nature that they should have\r\n  been resolved by the parties through agreement and/or mediation.&quot;Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is not clear that the family court considered confidential communications in\r\n  reaching its decision to award attorney's fees because it merely looked at the\r\n  &quot;nature&quot; of the &quot;issues brought before the [c]ourt.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Even if the family court considered evidence of mediation, the Record suggests\r\n  that both parties may have waived confidentiality by agreeing to voluntarily\r\n  submit the various offers of settlement for the court's consideration.Â  See  Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 480, 682 S.E.2d 804, 807 (2009) (a waiver is a\r\n  voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right) (citations omitted); Laser Supply and Servs., Inc. v. Orchard Park Assocs., 382 S.C. 326,\r\n    347 676 S.E.2d 139, 145 (Ct. App. 2009) (the determination of whether one's actions constitute waiver is a question of fact).Â  Nevertheless, the Record\r\n  provides sufficient independent grounds for the family court to award\r\n  attorney's fees based on Wife's non-cooperation and delay.Â  \r\nThus,\r\n  we affirm the family court's award of $3,250 in attorney's fees.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justices James E.\r\n  Moore and DeAndrea Gist Benjamin, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wifeâ€™s expert alleged that Husband actually earned\r\n  $8,333 per month from 2000 to 2004.Â  \r\n[2] But shortly after Wife filed for divorce, Husband\r\n  purchased a new home worth approximately 1 million dollars, a brand new Porsche\r\n  costing $90,000, and a new office in the Vista area of Columbia.Â  \r\n[3] The Record lacks details concerning the post-filing activities\r\n  of Husband in acquiring the Casual Living lease.\r\n[4] Similar to the Bowman court, we recognized in McDavid that the statutory filing date is not appropriate for every situation and that\r\n  &quot;both parties may be entitled to share in any appreciation in\r\n  marital assets which occurs after the parties separate but before the parties\r\n  divorce.&quot;Â  333 S.C. at 497\r\n    n.7, 511 S.E.2d at 369 n.7 (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n[5] We question whether Husbandâ€™s stake in the property\r\n  really was valueless at the time of filing because of the business and\r\n  investment opportunities that such a stake presents.Â  However, we do not reach\r\n  this question because here the parties dispute only the appreciation in the\r\n  value of the land post-filing.\r\n[6] We emphasize that the determination of whether a\r\n  person's involvement crosses the threshold from passive to active requires an\r\n  intensive examination of the underlying facts, and in this particular case\r\n  involving a close corporation, Husband's level of activity does not pass muster.Â Â  \r\n[7] In its order, the family court noted, &quot;[T]he\r\n  Court has considered the lengthy period of time this property has been on the\r\n  market for sale unsuccessfully and Wife's failure to remove Husband from the\r\n  Paradise Island financing, despite the Order of the Court.&quot;\r\n[8] ADR rule 8(a)(4) provides: \r\n\r\n[T]he parties and any\r\n  other person present shall maintain the confidentiality of the mediation and\r\n  shall not rely on, or introduce as evidence in any arbitral, judicial, or other\r\n  proceeding, any oral or written communication having occurred in a mediation\r\n  proceeding, including but not limited to . . .

Brooker, Jr, SCDOT, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nT.S. Stern, Jr. and V. Elizabeth Wright, of Covington Patrick\r\n  Hagins Stern &amp; Lewis, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN: This is the second appeal involving a\r\n  highway construction project and the payment bond for it required by the\r\n  Subcontractors and Suppliers Payment Protection Act (SPPA).Â  After examining Sloan\r\n    Construction Co. v. Southco Grassing, Inc., 377 S.C. 108, 659 S.E.2d 158\r\n  (2008) (Sloan I), we find a governmental entity does not have a\r\n  continuing obligation to maintain a payment bond.Â  However, we hold that Sloan\r\n    I is the law of the case and affirm the circuit court's order that SCDOT\r\n  was liable to Sloan Construction.Â  We further affirm the circuit court's finding\r\n  SCDOT did not meet its burden in proving Sloan Construction failed to mitigate\r\n  its damages.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSouthco\r\n  Grassing, Inc. (Southco) and SCDOT were parties to a contract in January 2000\r\n  for the performance of highway maintenance in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  In\r\n  connection with the contract and the SPPA, Southco supplied to SCDOT a\r\n  performance bond and a payment bond with Southco as principal and Amwest\r\n  Insurance Company (Amwest) as surety in the penal sum of 100% of the face value\r\n  of the contract.Â  On November 27, 2000, Sloan Construction Company entered into\r\n  a subcontract with Southco, and it is undisputed that Sloan Construction\r\n  properly performed all of its work.Â  During the course of performance on the\r\n  project, Amwest was adjudged insolvent in Nebraska and ordered to be\r\n  liquidated; all outstanding bonds, including the bond with Southco, were\r\n  cancelled. Â A Nebraska court approved a distribution amount of forty percent of\r\n  each claim to be relinquished to claimants who previously held bonds.[1]\r\n On July 28, 2001,\r\n  SCDOT wrote Southco, advising it of the need to obtain a replacement surety\r\n  company for the payment bond.Â  Southco did not respond or replace the bond.Â \r\n  Sloan Construction submitted to Southco its final billing on October 31, 2001; however,\r\n  Southco never paid any amount of money to Sloan Construction.Â  A few months\r\n  later, on January 15, 2002, Sloan Construction notified SCDOT of its demand for\r\n  payment from SCDOT by reason of Southco's failure to pay.Â  Shortly thereafter,\r\n  on February 6, 2002, Sloan Construction's lawyer advised SCDOT that SCDOT was\r\n  liable for its failure to require Southco to obtain a bond in substitution for\r\n  the cancelled Amwest payment bond.Â  The following day, SCDOT responded that &quot;[a]ll\r\n  payments under the contract with Southco have not been made.Â  It is likely some\r\n  funds may remain and may therefore be available to at least partially satisfy\r\n  your client's claims.&quot;Â  Wanda Surrett, Southco's principal, represented in\r\n  writing to SCDOT on March 6, 2003, that all payments had been made in full for\r\n  work performed in connection with the project.Â  Later that same month, SCDOT\r\n  completed its checklist confirming Southco had completed all contract work and\r\n  dispersed to Southco its final retainage.Â  However, Southco never paid Sloan\r\n  Construction for its work.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n Thereafter, Sloan\r\n  Construction commenced this action against Southco, Surrett, SCDOT, and Greer\r\n  State Bank, but it made no claim against Amwest.Â  Sloan Construction alleged\r\n  negligence against SCDOT pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and\r\n  breach of contract as a third party beneficiary of Southco and SCDOT's contract,\r\n  both relating to SCDOT's obligation under the SPPA to ensure a contractor is properly\r\n  bonded.Â  SCDOT moved to dismiss Sloan Construction's complaint against it under\r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, and the circuit court granted the motion on the ground\r\n  that there was no private right of action to sue for violations of the SPPA.Â \r\n  The court of appeals affirmed this dismissal, but we reversed that decision in Sloan\r\n    I and remanded the matter for a determination of SCDOT's liability to Sloan\r\n  Construction consistent with the opinion. 377 S.C. at 121, 659 S.E.2d at 166.Â \r\n  On remand, the circuit court found SCDOT liable in the amount of $26,393.37.Â  The\r\n  court also held SCDOT did not meet its burden of proof in showing Sloan\r\n  Construction failed to mitigate its damages when it did not file a claim\r\n  against Amwest.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\nSCDOT raises two issues on appeal:\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in\r\n  ruling SCDOT had a duty to maintain a payment bond under the SPPA? \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in\r\n  ruling SCDOT failed to meet its burden of proof regarding mitigation?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; DUTY TO MAINTAIN BOND\r\n In Sloan I,\r\n  we granted certiorari on the following issue: &quot;Did the court of appeals\r\n  err in holding that statutory bond requirements applicable to public projects\r\n  do not create an enforceable duty giving rise to a private right of action by a\r\n  subcontractor against a government entity?&quot; 377 S.C. at 112, 659 S.E.2d at\r\n  161.Â  In answering that question, we held that &quot;the duty created under the\r\n  SPPA gives rise to a private right of action against a government entity for\r\n  failure to ensure that a contractor is properly bonded.&quot; Id. at\r\n  118, 659 S.E.2d at 164.Â  We instructed that the SPPA is separate from the &quot;little\r\n  Miller Acts&quot; enacted in various states which address the problem of\r\n  subcontractors not being able to use liens on public property to secure\r\n  payment. Id. at 114, 659 S.E.2d at 161-62. Â As we noted, the SPPA was\r\n  intended to give stronger payment protection to subcontractors on government\r\n  projects than the &quot;little Miller Acts.&quot; Id. at 115, 659 S.E.2d\r\n  at 162.Â  As to the third-party beneficiary claim, we first determined that\r\n  public policies contained in the SPPA plus its applicability to public\r\n  procurement incorporated the bond requirements into construction contracts. Id. at 120, 659 S.E.2d at 165.Â  We then found that because subcontractors are the\r\n  only ones with a financial stake in enforcing bond requirements, they are\r\n  direct third-party beneficiaries to\r\n  these contracts and could bring suit against governmental entities for their\r\n  failure to ensure a payment bond is properly in place. Id.Â  \r\nWe stated in Sloan I that &quot;a\r\n  government agency's failure to secure and maintain statutory bonding as\r\n  required by the SPPA&quot; gives rise to an action against the agency. Id. at 120, 659 S.E.2d at 165 (emphasis added).Â  Sloan Construction thus argues\r\n  SCDOT's claim that it had no duty to continuously monitor the bond was already\r\n  determined in Sloan I and therefore is the law of the case.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nUnder the law of the case doctrine, &quot;a\r\n  party is precluded from relitigating, after an appeal, matters that were either\r\n  not raised on appeal, but should have been, or raised on appeal, but expressly\r\n  rejected by the appellate court.&quot; Judy v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455,\r\n  458-59, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153 (2009) (citing Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C.\r\n  612, 632, 576 S.E.2d 156, 166 (2003)). &quot;The law of the case applies both\r\n  to those issues explicitly decided and to those issues which were necessarily\r\n  decided in the former case.&quot; Nelson v. Charleston &amp; Western\r\n    Carolina Railway Co., 231 S.C. 351, 357, 98 S.E.2d 798, 800 (1957).Â  While Sloan\r\n      I did not specifically raise the issue of maintenance of the payment bond,\r\n  this Court's holding resolved that issue in this matter.Â  However, although Sloan\r\n    I requires us to affirm the circuit court's ruling that SCDOT had a duty to\r\n  maintain the bond in this case, we take this opportunity to address whether a governmental\r\n  entity otherwise has a duty to continuously monitor and maintain a bond on a\r\n  construction project.Â  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory\r\n  construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. Kiriakides\r\n    v. United Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366\r\n  (1994) (&quot;All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one\r\n  that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in\r\n  the language used . . . .&quot;). Â If a statute's language is plain,\r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, &quot;the rules of statutory\r\n  interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\n  meaning.&quot; Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 582\r\n  (2000). Â &quot;In construing statutory language, the statute must be read as a\r\n  whole, and sections which are part of the same general statutory law must be\r\n  construed together and each one given effect.&quot; TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 620, 503 S.E.2d 471, 476 (1998). \r\nAs\r\n  recognized in Sloan I, the SPPA creates a duty on the part of SCDOT to\r\n  secure an appropriate bond for its projects, the breach of which gives rise to\r\n  a cause of action on behalf of the contractor or subcontractor. Â In pertinent\r\n  part, the SPPA reads as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) When a governmental body is a party to a contract\r\n  to improve real property, and the contract is for a sum in excess of fifty\r\n  thousand dollars, the owner of the property shall require the contractor to\r\n  provide a labor and material payment bond in the full amount of the contract .\r\n  . . . \r\n. . . . \r\n(3) For the purposes of any contract covered by the\r\n  provisions of this section, it is the duty of the entity contracting for the\r\n    improvement to take reasonable steps to assure that the appropriate payment\r\n    bond is issued and is in proper form.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-250\r\n  (emphasis added). \r\nSome\r\n  jurisdictions have determined whether a bonding statute places an affirmative\r\n  duty on government entities to require contractors to provide a payment bond\r\n  for public works projects. Compare Med. Clinic Bd. of the City of\r\n    Birmingham-Crestwood v. E.E. Smelley, 408 So.2d 1203, 1204 (Ala. 1981)\r\n  (finding liability against a municipality for failing to require a bond based\r\n  on statute), with O &amp; G Indus., Inc. v. Town of New Milford,\r\n  640 A.2d 110, 111 (Conn. 1994) (finding no liability for failing to require a\r\n  bond).Â  In addition, courts have also considered whether such statutes place a\r\n  duty on government entities to ensure that a contractor's bond is valid. See,\r\n    e.g., DeKalb County v. J &amp; A Pipeline Co., 437 S.E.2d 327, 330\r\n  (Ga. 1993) (holding there is a duty on the government entity to take the bond\r\n  and the surety's affidavit in &quot;specified manner and form&quot;).Â  However,\r\n  the jurisdictions that have considered the precise issue hereâ€”whether a bonding\r\n  statute places on a government entity a continuing duty to ensure a\r\n  valid bond is maintained by a contractor throughout the course of the\r\n  construction processâ€”have answered that question in the negative.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  one of the first cases to address this issue, the Michigan Court of Appeals\r\n  determined that Michigan's bonding statute imposed no such duty on a\r\n  governmental body. Barnes &amp; Sweeney Enters., Inc. v. City of Hazel Park,\r\n  425 N.W.2d 572, 573 (Mich. 1988).Â  In Barnes &amp; Sweeney, the City of\r\n  Hazel Park contracted with Conco Midwest to repair the city's streets. Id.Â \r\n  Barnes &amp; Sweeney was subcontracted to supply materials for the project. Id.Â \r\n  After Conco defaulted on payments, Barnes &amp; Sweeney discovered the payment\r\n  bond obtained for the project had expired prior to the beginning of its work. Id.Â \r\n  In its suit against the city and other parties, the subcontractor claimed the\r\n  city had breached its statutory duty to ensure that Conco's payment bond was\r\n  still valid throughout the time the subcontractor supplied materials for the\r\n  project. Id.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Hazel Park and\r\n  the other defendants, and the court of appeals affirmed the finding that the\r\n  city owed no duty to inform the subcontractor of the bond's expiration or to\r\n  ensure that the bond was renewed. Id. Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  Arizona Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in Flori Corp. v. Yellow Rose\r\n    Development &amp; Construction, Inc., 911 P.2d 546 (Ariz. 1995).Â Â  In Flori, Yellow Rose and the City of Tucson contracted for certain\r\n  improvements, and Yellow Rose posted payment and performance bonds obtained\r\n  from Pacific States Casualty. See 911 P.2d at 547.Â  One of Yellow Rose's\r\n  subcontractors notified Tucson that it had not been paid, and shortly\r\n  thereafter, Tucson learned Pacific States was in a court-ordered\r\n  conservatorship in California. Id.Â  Tucson eventually terminated its\r\n  contract with Yellow Rose, and various subcontractors of Yellow Rose who did\r\n  not receive payment brought suit against Tucson. Id. at 547-48.Â  The\r\n  subcontractors argued that Tucson owed a duty to subcontractors to ensure that\r\n  a payment bond was always in effect from a financially secure surety. Id.Â Â \r\n  The court in Flori rejected that claim, noting that it &quot;joined most\r\n  other courts&quot; in so holding. Id.Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  believe the reasoning behind these courts' rejection of a continuous duty on a\r\n  government entity to ensure a viable bond is in place is sound and persuasive.\r\n\r\n[I]t\r\n  would be a herculean task for those governmental units which are engaged in a\r\n  number of public works projects at any given time to continually check to\r\n  ensure that a payment bond is still in force for each project and to determine\r\n  the identity of the various subcontractors and suppliers and to advise them of\r\n  the status of the payment bond.\r\n\r\nBarnes &amp; Sweeney, 425 N.W.2d at 575.Â  While an unhappy\r\n  situation for all parties involved in these situations, &quot;the legislature [\r\n  ] did not provide that a public entity would guarantee the debts of the general\r\n  contractor nor the financial stability of bonding companies.&quot; Flori\r\n    Corp., 911 P.2d at 548.Â Â  \r\nLike\r\n  the statutes examined in Barnes &amp; Sweeney and Flori, section\r\n  29-6-250, by its terms, imposes an obligation upon the entity only to ensure\r\n  the appropriate bond is issued and in proper form.Â  Holding that a government\r\n  entity has a continuing duty to maintain a payment bond under the SPPA would\r\n  effectively render government entities guarantors of the general contractor's\r\n  payment bonds.Â  If the government entity has a continuing duty to maintain a\r\n  payment bond under the SPPA, the reason for requiring the bond in the first\r\n  place is substantially eroded.Â  The plain language of the statute does not\r\n  require the government entity to ensure the maintenance of the bond throughout\r\n  the course of the project, and we discern no reason why the General Assembly\r\n  would place such an onerous requirement on government entities.Â Â  As a result,\r\n  we hold that governmental entities do not have a duty to continuously maintain\r\n  a bond in these situations.\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; MITIGATION\r\nSCDOT\r\n  additionally argues the circuit court erred in rejecting its argument that\r\n  Sloan Construction failed to mitigate its damages, thereby entitling SCDOT to\r\n  offset the amounts Sloan Construction could have recovered from the Amwest\r\n  liquidator had it filed a claim.Â  The defendant has the burden of establishing\r\n  the plaintiff's lack of due diligence in mitigating damages. Adams v. Orr,\r\n  260 S.C. 92, 98, 194 S.E.2d 232, 235 (1973).Â  After a thorough review of the\r\n  record, we find there is evidence to support the circuit court's finding that\r\n  SCDOT failed to meet its burden to establish a lack of due diligence in this\r\n  case.Â  Therefore, we affirm.Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Therefore,\r\n  we affirm the circuit court's ruling that SCDOT is liable to Sloan Construction\r\n  for its failure to maintain a valid bond and that SCDOT did not meet its burden\r\n  in proving Sloan Construction failed to mitigate its damages.Â  However,\r\n  pursuant to the clear language of the statute, governmental entities otherwise have\r\n  no duty to continuously maintain a bond throughout the life of a construction project.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in result only in a separate opinion.Â \r\n  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority that\r\n  SCDOT is liable to Sloan Construction under our holding in Sloan I, and\r\n  that SCDOT did not meet its burden in proving Sloan Construction failed to\r\n  mitigate its damages.Â  However, I strongly disagree with the majority's\r\n  suggestion that Sloan I is no longer binding precedent. \r\n The Court already\r\n  squarely addressed the issue of the SCDOT's continuing duty to secure and\r\n  maintain a bond under the SPPA in Sloan I, despite the majority's\r\n  contention to the contrary.Â  The majority relies on the statement in Sloan I that a governmental agency's liability under the SPPA can be premised on that\r\n  agency's &quot;failure to secure and maintain statutory bonding\r\n  as required by the SPPA&quot; as the determining factor of SCDOT's liability in\r\n  the present action.Â  Sloan I, 377 S.C. at 120, 659 S.E.2d at 165\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  However, after stating that Sloan I is binding\r\n  precedent under the law of the case doctrine, the majority opinion then\r\n  effectively overrules Sloan I by holding it has no future application.Â \r\n  In my view, we held in Sloan I that SCDOT had a continuing duty to\r\n  secure and maintain a bond, and for this reason, we should now affirm\r\n  accordingly.Â  \r\n Furthermore, it is\r\n  my opinion that we correctly interpreted the SPPA to require a continuing duty\r\n  to maintain a bond in Sloan I.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-20(3) (stating that &quot;it\r\n  is the duty of the entity contracting for the improvement to take reasonable\r\n  steps to assure that the appropriate payment bond is issued and is in proper\r\n  form.&quot;).Â  It is my firm belief that the legislature did not intend\r\n  to protect a governmental entity at the expense of an innocent (and extremely\r\n  vulnerable) subcontractor in enacting the bond requirement of the SPPA.[2]Â  \r\n Therefore, I would\r\n  affirm the order of the circuit court because SCDOT had a continuing duty to\r\n  maintain the construction bond under our holding in Sloan I.Â  For this\r\n  reason, I concur in result only. \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent because, as I stated the\r\n  first time this case came before the Court, it is my opinion that the SPPA does\r\n  not apply here.Â  Moreover, the majority acknowledges that the issue of\r\n  maintaining the payment bond was not before the Court in the first appeal, but\r\n  concludes that the inclusion of that term in a holding renders it the law of\r\n  the case.Â  I disagree.Â  E.g., Berberich v. Jack, 392 S.C. 278,\r\n  709 S.E.2d 607 (2011) (appellate court comments on unpreserved issue must be\r\n  viewed as dicta).Â  I simply point out that the law of the case doctrine\r\n  does not apply to mere dicta.Â  E.g., Whiteâ€™s Mill Colony Inc.\r\n    v. Williams, 363 S.C. 117, 609 S.E.2d 811 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n I would reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] While Amwest was adjudged insolvent in 2001, the\r\n  distributed amount was not approved until 2009.Â Â  The trustee in Nebraska\r\n  apparently represented that distributions of no less than a total of fifty\r\n  percent of each bond claim would be made before Amwest's estate was exhausted.Â  \r\n[2] I note that the actions of SCDOT in this case were\r\n  particularly egregious, in that the agency possessed knowledge of Amwest's\r\n  financial dissolution and was aware of Southwest's failure to secure a\r\n  replacement bond, yet when charged with this knowledge, SCDOT paid Southwest\r\n  anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27062","title":"State v.

Moreover, the Court affirmed the court of appeals as to the jury instruction, holding the trial court was not required to instruct the jury on the law of accident because the evidence demonstrated that Petitioner merely sought advice from the \"jailhouse lawyer\" and posed the scenario in which he accidentally killed the victim as part of a hypothetical question about what he should tell his attorney.

Commander, 384 S.C. 66, 681 S.E.2d 31 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009), claiming the court of appeals erred by affirming the trial court's\r\n  admission of expert testimony concerning the victim's manner of death and\r\n  refusal to instruct the jury on the defense of accident.Â  We affirm the court\r\n  of appeals' decision as modified.\r\nFacts/ Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nOn\r\n  January 7, 2005, family members discovered Gervonya Goodwin's (Victim)\r\n  mummified[1] and partially decomposed body covered by a blanket and lying on a sofa inside\r\n  her home.[2]Â \r\n  Victim's family members and friends had not seen or spoken to her since\r\n  November 29, 2004.Â  A police investigation revealed (and numerous trial witnesses\r\n  attested) that Petitioner stole Victim's purse, mobile telephone, and vehicle\r\n  from her home, sent text messages from Victim's phone to her family members in\r\n  which Petitioner pretended to be Victim alive and on vacation, withdrew money\r\n  from her bank account, used her credit cards, made calls on Victim's behalf\r\n  from her mobile telephone, and used that telephone number as a contact number\r\n  for a telephone chat line.Â  \r\n\r\nAt\r\n  the time of his arrest in New Orleans, Louisiana, Petitioner possessed Victim's\r\n  vehicle.Â  After police officers gained entry into his hotel room, Petitioner admitted\r\n  killing Victim.[3]Â \r\n  The arresting officers recovered items from Petitioner's hotel room that\r\n  connected Petitioner to Victim, including her checkbook, driverâ€™s license,\r\n  birth certificate, ultrasound image, OB-GYN appointment card, a medical slip\r\n  bearing her name, car keys, and keys to another vehicle that police located in\r\n  Victim's driveway.Â  Trial testimony established that Victim and Petitioner\r\n  worked together, lived together, and shared an intimate relationship, that Petitioner\r\n  fathered Victim's unborn child, and that Victim tried to end the relationship\r\n  shortly before she disappeared. \r\nPetitioner's\r\n  issues on appeal concern the testimony of two of the State's witnesses. Â Dr.\r\n  Clay Nichols testified as the State's expert witness in forensic pathology.[4]Â  Dr. Nichols responded to the crime scene in his\r\n  capacity as chief medical examiner for Richland County on the day Victim's body\r\n  was discovered in her home, and subsequently performed an autopsy on the body.Â \r\n  Dr. Nichols testified the autopsy did not uncover any evidence of violence or\r\n  trauma to Victim's body or any other evidence of injury.Â  A later toxicology report\r\n  was similarly indefinite.Â  However, using the anecdotal history relayed by\r\n  officers at the scene, together with the lack of normal indicators of physical\r\n  violence, Dr. Nichols opined that the cause of death was asphyxiation, which\r\n  would not leave physical marks, and that the manner of death was homicide due\r\n  to the suspicious nature of Victim's death.Â  The following colloquy occurred\r\n  when the Solicitor questioned Dr. Nichols about his preliminary findings:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Did you comeâ€”after your examination\r\n  and prior to getting the toxicology reports back, did you come to a preliminary\r\n  conclusion as [to] the cause of death[5] in this case?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, I did.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       And what was that, sir?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Given the fact that this woman\r\n  died under suspicious circumstances, that the history I was given was that\r\n  herâ€”she was already in her house, no one had talked to her for a period of\r\n  time, her car was missing, her purse was missing, there was some indication\r\n  that somebody was sending text messages to family members indicating that the\r\n  dead woman . . . was still alive, this indicated an extremely suspicious\r\n  circumstance, and I felt that we were dealing with a homicide.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDefense counsel\r\n  objected to Dr. Nichols's description of the death as a &quot;homicide,&quot;\r\n  asserting it constituted an opinion concerning a legal issue because\r\n  &quot;homicide&quot; implies criminal culpability.Â  Therefore, defense counsel\r\n  argued, Dr. Nichols's testimony concerning the cause and manner of death was\r\n  inadmissible under Rule 702, SCRE, because it invaded the province of the\r\n  jury.Â  This prompted the trial judge to question Dr. Nichols outside the\r\n  presence of the jury about the meaning of &quot;homicide&quot; in his line of\r\n  work.Â  Dr. Nichols replied:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, sir.Â  Homicide is someone who\r\n  died as a result of the actions of another individual.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       As opposed to?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       An accidental cause where somebody\r\n  unintentionally caused death to another individual.Â \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDefense counsel\r\n  again objected to Dr. Nichols's reference to intent in his definition of\r\n  &quot;homicide&quot; and asked the court to provide a curative instruction to\r\n  the jury.Â  Instead of providing a curative instruction, however, the trial\r\n  judge allowed the State to proceed with the line of questioning, instructing\r\n  counsel to question Dr. Nichols further, so that he could explain his\r\n  definition of &quot;homicide&quot; to the jurors.[6] Â This directive occasioned the\r\n  following exchange in front of the jury:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Doctor, what is your definition of homicide?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n      A person that has died as a result\r\n  of another personâ€™s actions.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And in your opinion in this case,\r\n  was this or could this have been a natural death?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       No, I donâ€™t believe so.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Or an accidental death?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       No, I donâ€™t believe so.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Or a suicide?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       No, I donâ€™t believe so.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And that is your expert opinion?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, it is.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       During the course of your\r\n  examination, were there any signs of any kind of disease or anything else that\r\n  could have caused her death?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       No.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And as to the cause of death, what was your opinion?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Once again, not stabbed, not shot,\r\n  not beaten, not strangled with hands. And as a result of looking at the body of\r\n  [Victim] and reviewing the circumstances of her death, I was looking for a\r\n  cause of death that would leave no marks, no evidence of injury.Â  And as such,\r\n  I feel that [Victim] died as a result of asphyxiation.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nUnder\r\n  cross-examination by defense counsel about the &quot;suspicious circumstances&quot;\r\n  of the death, Dr. Nichols recounted autopsy procedures and the methodology he\r\n  used in arriving at his opinion, and stated:\r\n\r\nI believe [Victim] died of unnatural causes.Â  And as a result of\r\n  elimination [of other manners of death], and like you mentioned, the\r\n  interpolation of the facts of the case, that being her purse is gone, her car\r\n  is gone, the house is locked up and somebody went through an awful lot of\r\n  effort to cover up this death,[7] that I feel that [Victim] died as a result of homicide due to asphyxiation.Â  \r\n\r\nFinally, Dr. Nichols noted, &quot;I'm not claiming intent.Â  Iâ€™m\r\n  claiming that [Victim] died as a result of somebody elseâ€™s actions.&quot;\r\nPetitioner's &quot;jailhouse lawyer,&quot; John F. Presley, also testified\r\n  at trial.Â  He stated that Petitioner sought legal advice from him while both\r\n  men were detained at the county jail.Â  Presley testified Petitioner told him he\r\n  admitted to arresting\r\n  officers that he killed Victim and wondered whether his statements would impair\r\n  his case.Â  Presley testified that he and Petitioner had the following\r\n  discussion a few days later: \r\n\r\n[Petitioner] said, &quot;What do you think if I told my attorney\r\n  to tell them that she . . . hit me in the head with a stick, we had an argument\r\n  and she hit me in the head with a stick and I fell unconscious and fell on top\r\n  of her, and when I regained consciousness she had died from being\r\n  suffocated?&quot; \r\nAnd [Presley] said, &quot;Well, no one is going to believe\r\n  that.&quot;\r\n. . .\r\nWell, either later that day or the next day, [Presley] spoke to\r\n  [Petitioner] again.Â  And [Presley] asked him the question, was [Victim]\r\n  cheating on him, and he denied that she was cheating on him.Â  And [Presley]\r\n  asked him was he cheating on her, and he said he had friends like on the side,\r\n  but it wasnâ€™t nothing serious. \r\nAnd [Presley] asked [Petitioner] then, [Presley] said, well, what\r\n  really happened then, you know, what really went on.Â  \r\nAnd [Petitioner] said that he and [Victim] had an argument, [Victim]\r\n  hit him with a stick, and in other words heâ€”she pissed him off and he fell on\r\n  her and suffocated her.Â  \r\nAnd [Presley] asked [Petitioner] were you unconscious, and\r\n  [Petitioner] said, no, he wasnâ€™t unconscious, he suffocated her.\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n[Petitioner] said that he wrapped her body in sheets and placed\r\n  her body on the sofa somewhere in the house.Â  [Petitioner] placed her body on\r\n  the sofa and left her there.Â  And [Petitioner] said he took her credit cards\r\n  and her car.Â  And [Petitioner] went to various states.[8]\r\n\r\nPresley\r\n  subsequently informed police that Petitioner admitted killing Victim.Â  \r\nPetitioner asked the trial court to instruct the jury on the\r\n  defenses of self-defense and accident based on Presley's testimony.Â  The trial\r\n  court declined Petitioner's request, finding the evidence did not substantiate\r\n  the charge.Â  Instead, the trial court instructed the jury on the law of murder,\r\n  voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter.\r\nA\r\n  jury found Petitioner guilty of murder pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10\r\n  (2003).\r\nIssues\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the court of appeals erred\r\n  in affirming the circuit court's admission of expert testimony concerning\r\n  Victim's manner of death?\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the court of appeals erred\r\n  in affirming the circuit court's refusal to charge the defense of accident?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n&quot;The general rule in this State is that the conduct of a\r\n  criminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the presiding judge\r\n  and this Court will not interfere unless it clearly appears that the rights of the\r\n  complaining party were abused or prejudiced in some way.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, \r\n448, 298 S.E.2d\r\n  212, 212 (1982) (citations omitted).Â  Therefore, in criminal cases, this Court will only review errors of law.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nDiscussion\r\nI.&nbsp; Admissibility\r\n  of Expert Testimony\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within the\r\n  trial court's sound discretion, and an appellate court may only disturb a\r\n  ruling admitting or excluding evidence upon a showing of a &quot;manifest abuse\r\n  of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.&quot;Â  State v. Douglas, 369 S.C. 424, 429, 632 S.E.2d\r\n  845, 847-48 (2006) (citations omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court allowing Dr. Nichols\r\n  to testify that Victim died as a result of a &quot;homicide&quot; because any\r\n  error on the part of the trial judge was harmless in view of the overwhelming\r\n  evidence of Petitioner's guilt.Â  On appeal, Petitioner argues that the court of\r\n  appeals erred because Dr. Nichols's testimony was inadmissible under Rule 702,\r\n  SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt\r\n  the outset, we note that the court of appeals\r\n  correctly analyzed Petitioner's position under a harmless error analysis.Â  We agree\r\n  with the court of appeals that the circumstantial evidence implicating\r\n  Petitioner was overwhelming.Â  See Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons,\r\n    Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 375 (2005) (citations\r\n  omitted) (&quot;To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of\r\n  evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the\r\n  resulting prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability the jury's verdict\r\n  was influenced by the wrongly admitted or excluded evidence.&quot;); State\r\n    v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 333, 563 S.E.2d 315, 318 (2002) (listing factors of a harmless error analysis, including &quot;the importance of the witness'\r\n  testimony in the prosecution's case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the\r\n  presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of\r\n  the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise\r\n  permitted, and of course the overall strength of the prosecution's case.&quot;)\r\n  (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)); State v.\r\n    Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (&quot;Error is\r\n  harmless when it 'could not reasonably have affected the result of the\r\n  trial.'&quot;) (quoting State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 180 S.E.2d 888\r\n  (1971)).Â  \r\nHowever, we take this opportunity to expound on the admissibility\r\n  of Dr. Nichols's expert testimony under Rule 702, SCRE. \r\n\r\nRule 702, SCRE, provides:\r\nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will\r\n  assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\r\n  issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\r\n  training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or\r\n  otherwise.\r\n\r\nGenerally,\r\n  &quot;[t]estimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible\r\n  is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the\r\n  trier of fact.&quot;Â  Rule 704, SCRE.Â  However, expert testimony on issues of\r\n  law is usually inadmissible.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 66-67, 580\r\n  S.E.2d 433, 437 (2003) (citations omitted) (finding the trial court properly\r\n  declined to consider an expert affidavit that &quot;offered some helpful,\r\n  factual information&quot; but\r\n  mainly offered legal arguments concerning the reasons the trial court should\r\n  deny summary judgment); Green v.\r\n    State, 351 S.C. 184, 198, 569 S.E.2d 318, 325 (2002) (affirming the\r\n  exclusion of expert testimony where &quot;[t]he testimony was not designed to\r\n  assist the PCR court to understand certain facts, but, rather, was legal\r\n  argument why the PCR court should rule, as a matter of law, trial counsel's\r\n  actions fell below an acceptable legal standard of competence.&quot;). Â Likewise,\r\n  an expert's testimony may not exceed the scope of his expertise.Â  State v.\r\n    Ellis, 345 S.C. 175, 547 S.E.2d 490 (2001) (finding police officer, who was\r\n  qualified as an expert in crime scene processing and fingerprint\r\n  identification, exceeded the scope of his expertise when he was permitted to\r\n  testify to conclusions drawn from the location and position of the victimâ€™s\r\n  body at the time of the shooting). \r\nState law requires medical examiners to make an initial inquiry,\r\n  forming the basis of a medical conclusion, as to the cause and manner of death\r\n  in certain instances. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-5-530(A)(5) (Supp. 2010)\r\n  (&quot;If a person dies . . . in any suspicious or unusual manner . . . a\r\n  person having knowledge of the death immediately shall notify the county\r\n  coroner's or medical examiner's office.&quot;); id. Â§ 17-5-530(B)\r\n  (requiring a coroner or medical examiner once notified to &quot;make an\r\n  immediate inquiry into the cause and manner of death&quot;).Â  The statute\r\n  defines &quot;cause of death&quot; as &quot;the agent that has directly or\r\n  indirectly resulted in a death.&quot; Â Id. Â§ 17-5-5(2). Â On the other\r\n  hand, &quot;manner of death&quot; is &quot;the means or fatal agency that\r\n  caused a death.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 17-5-5(9). Â The statute further categorizes\r\n  the &quot;manner of death&quot; as natural, accidental, homicidal, suicidal,\r\n  and undetermined. Â Id. (emphasis added). Â To aid in his or her\r\n  determination of cause and manner of death, a medical examiner will routinely\r\n  conduct an autopsy, which is defined by the statute as &quot;the dissection of\r\n  a dead body and the removal of bone, tissue, organs or foreign objects for the\r\n  purpose of determining the cause and manner of death.&quot;Â  Id. Â§\r\n  17-5-210(5).\r\nIn\r\n  this context, then, the testimony that an individual died from\r\n  &quot;homicide&quot; means simply that he or she died &quot;by the act, procurement,\r\n  or omission of another&quot;\r\n  without regard to the criminality of the killing or culpability of the killer.Â \r\n  23 S.C. Jur. Homicide Â§ 2 (2011) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 661 (5th ed.\r\n  1979)).[9]Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is well-established in South Carolina that a medical professional, qualified as\r\n  an expert, may render an opinion concerning the scientific bases of a victim's\r\n  injuries or death in a criminal trial. Â Even before the codification of Rule\r\n  702, SCRE, the Court explained: \r\n\r\nThat in questions of science, skill or trade, or others of like\r\n  kind, persons of skill, sometimes called experts, may not only testify to\r\n  facts, but are permitted to give their opinions in evidence. Thus, the opinions\r\n  of medical men are constantly admitted as to cause of death or disease or the\r\n  consequences of wounds, and as to the sane or insane state of a person's mind,\r\n  as collected from a number of circumstances, and as to other objects of\r\n  professional skill; and such opinions are admissible in evidence, though the\r\n  witness founds them, not on his own personal observation, but on the case\r\n  itself as proved by other witnesses.\r\n\r\nState v. Griggs, 184 S.C. 304, 312-13, 192 S.E. 360, 364 (1937) (quoting State\r\n  v. Clark, 15 S.C. 403, 408 (1881) and Greenleaf, vol. 1 Â§ 440). Â Therefore,\r\n  a qualified expert[10] is permitted to testify concerning the cause and manner of death under Rule\r\n  702, SCRE.Â  See Rule 702, SCRE; see also Baraka v.\r\n    Commonwealth, 194 S.W.3d 313, 315 (Ky. 2006) (citations omitted) (&quot;[I]t\r\n  is axiomatic that a determination of the cause and manner which led to a\r\n  person's death is generally scientific in origin and outside the common knowledge\r\n  of layperson jurors.&quot;).\r\nBecause\r\n  autopsies assist the medical examiner at arriving at the cause and manner of\r\n  death, it follows that they fall within the purview of the expert's specialized\r\n  knowledge, and therefore, expert testimony concerning their contents is often\r\n  deemed helpful to the trier of fact.Â  See Rule 702, SCRE.Â  Petitioner\r\n  argues that an expert should not be permitted to testify concerning autopsy findings\r\n  which are based on information comprising the circumstantial evidence in a case.Â  In our estimation, however, anecdotal history\r\n  is routinely relied on by medical professionals in fulfilling their duties\r\n  under section 17-5-530 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The role played by this\r\n  information in arriving at a finding as to the cause and manner of death was aptly\r\n  described by Dr. Nichols under cross-examination when he testified:\r\n\r\n[T]here\r\n  is some confusion as to what [role] the history actually plays in the part of\r\n  the autopsy.Â  Many people feel the autopsy is nothing more than the dissection\r\n  of a person and looking at the tissues underneath the microscope.Â  The history\r\n  is vital and a mandatory part of all autopsies.Â  It's such a mandatory part\r\n  that I must document in every autopsy I do where the history came from and who\r\n  gave it to me.Â  And without a history, the autopsy, in and of itself, is\r\n  invalid. The two are not separable, they are part of one another.Â  The autopsy\r\n  includes the history as well as all the other anatomic and laboratory findings.\r\n\r\nBecause the anecdotal history\r\n  is an essential component of any autopsy, we find testimony concerning findings\r\n  based on this information falls within the umbrella of the expert's specialized\r\n  knowledge.Â  See Rule 703, SCRE; Peterson v. National R.R. Passenger\r\n    Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 399, 618 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2005) (citations omitted) (&quot;An\r\n  expert witness may state an opinion based on facts not within his first-hand\r\n  knowledge, and may base his opinion on information, whether or not admissible,\r\n  made available to him before the hearing if the information is of the type\r\n  reasonably relied upon in the field.&quot;); Hundley ex rel. Hundley v. Rite\r\n    Aid of South Carolina, Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 295, 529 S.E.2d 45, 50-51 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000) (citations omitted) (stating &quot;an expert may testify as to\r\n  matters of hearsay for the purpose of showing what information he relied on in\r\n  giving his opinion of value&quot;); see also In Re Manigo,\r\n  389 S.C. 96, 106, 697 S.E.2d 629, 634 (Ct. App. 2010).Â  Dr. Nichols testified\r\n  extensively concerning his methodology, stating he arrived at the cause and\r\n  manner of death through a process of elimination, in which the lack of physical\r\n  injury figured prominently into his opinion that Victim died from asphyxiation\r\n  as a result of homicide. Â The information gleaned from the police investigation\r\n  formed merely one aspect of his examination.[11]\r\nHowever, we recognize that, in certain circumstances, expert\r\n  medical testimony of this type has the potential to invade the province of the\r\n  jury.Â  Petitioner urges that &quot;[t]he line is crossed where the physician gives an\r\n  opinion outside of his medical expertise where he is in reality only enhancing\r\n  the circumstantial evidence available to the jury with the prestige of a\r\n  forensic pathologist.&quot; Â Pet'r's Br. at 21. While we agree with the spirit\r\n  of Petitioner's contention, no such line was crossed in this case.\r\nOf the many courts in other jurisdictions that have considered\r\n  where to draw the line in these cases, we tend to agree with those courts that\r\n  have found that expert testimony addressing the state of mind or guilt of the\r\n  accused is inadmissible.

State, 489 So.2d 143, 145 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986) (finding trial\r\n  court erred in excluding medical examiner's testimony that death was accidental\r\n  in a fatal shooting because &quot;[s]uch opinions may support a conclusion that\r\n  a defendant is not guilty, but the opinions themselves are directed to expert\r\n  inferences to be drawn from a set of facts, not personal opinions of guilt or\r\n  innocence[]&quot;); State v. Howard, 195 Mont. 400, 637 P.2d 15 (Mont.\r\n  1981) (finding, despite doctor's qualification to testify about the nature and\r\n  extent of the victim's injuries, doctor could not testify that, based on the\r\n  nature of the injuries, the person who inflicted them did so with the intent to\r\n  murder because the jury was as qualified as the doctor to draw an inference of\r\n  intent from the circumstantial evidence). Â \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the circuit court judge relied on State v. Young, 662\r\n  A.2d 904 (Me. 1995), to aid him in determining whether to admit Dr. Nichols's\r\n  opinion testimony that Victim's death was a homicide, and we think such\r\n  reliance was appropriate.Â  Young is in line with those cases that have\r\n  allowed an expert to opine that the victim's death was a homicide so long as\r\n  the testimony does not speak to the defendant's &quot;state of mind at the time\r\n  of the killing,&quot; determining that such testimony &quot;would cross the\r\n  line between proper expert testimony and testimony in the form of a legal\r\n  conclusion.&quot;Â  Id. at 907.\r\nConsequently, we adopt a\r\n  rule whereby an expert in forensic pathology's opinion testimony as to cause\r\n  and manner of death is admissible under Rule 702, SCRE, so long as the expert\r\n  does not opine on the criminal defendant's state of mind or guilt or testify on\r\n  matters of law in such a way that the jury is not permitted to reach its own\r\n  conclusion concerning the criminal defendant's guilt or innocence.\r\n\r\nWe further\r\n  recognize that, practically speaking, there is a real possibility that a lay\r\n  juryperson could interpolate into our technical definition of\r\n  &quot;homicide&quot; his or her preconceived notions of criminal culpability.Â  Depending\r\n  on the circumstances, a jury instruction on the meaning of &quot;homicide&quot;\r\n  could prove necessary to prevent any resulting prejudice to the criminal\r\n  defendant.Â  In the present case, not only did counsel for Petitioner inform the\r\n  trial court that he did not seek an instruction on the meaning of\r\n  &quot;homicide,&quot; but the trial judge went to great lengths to ensure that the\r\n  jury was aware of the context of Dr. Nichols's testimony.Â  In particular, the\r\n  trial judge directed counsel to question Dr. Nichols in front of the jury on\r\n  the meaning of &quot;homicide.&quot;Â  In addition, the trial judge gave a\r\n  standard instruction to the jury concerning the relative weight to accord\r\n  witness testimony, including expert witness testimony, along with the other evidence\r\n  in the case.[12] Â Therefore, we find that any potential prejudice was cured, and the trial judge\r\n  did not abuse his discretion in admitting the testimony. \r\nII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Instruction\r\n&quot;An\r\n  appellate court will not reverse the trial judge's decision regarding a jury\r\n  charge absent an abuse of discretion.&quot; Â State v.

Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 440 S.E.2d 370 (1994)). Â &quot;A homicide is not excusable on the ground of\r\n  accident unless it appears that the defendant was acting lawfully.&quot; Â Id. (citations omitted) (affirming trial courtâ€™s refusal\r\n  to instruct the jury on the defense of accident where the evidence established\r\n  that the defendant engaged in assault and battery and the defendant presented\r\n  no evidence that he was acting in self-defense). Â \r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals held Pressley's testimony concerning his &quot;strategy\r\n  session&quot; with Petitioner did not represent evidence of accident because\r\n  Petitioner &quot;merely sought advice on what to tell his attorney.&quot;Â  Commander,\r\n  384 S.C. at 76, 681 S.E.2d at 36.Â  Therefore, the court of appeals held the\r\n  trial court acted within its discretion in refusing to charge the jury on\r\n  accident.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  contests this characterization of the evidence and submits he deserves a new\r\n  trial because State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 555 S.E.2d 391 (2001),\r\n  supports his contention that discrepancies in the evidence cannot divest a\r\n  criminal defendant of the advantage of using such evidence to support a jury\r\n  instruction on a lesser-included offense. \r\nIn our view, there was no\r\n  evidence to support an accident charge. Considering Pressley's testimony in the\r\n  light most favorable to Petitioner, Petitioner's conversations with Pressley\r\n  intimate that he may have fallen on top of Victim by accident, but not that he\r\n  suffocated her by accident.Â  Petitionerâ€™s only statement that he accidentally\r\n  killed Victim was posited as part of a hypothetical question to Presley in an\r\n  effort to garner legal advice and therefore, does not affirmatively indicate he\r\n  was unconscious at the time of Victim's death.Â  In contrast, in their later\r\n  conversation, Pressley testified Petitioner stated he was conscious when\r\n  he suffocated Victim.Â  Therefore, we agree with the court of appeals that\r\n  Petitioner's &quot;strategy session&quot; cannot form the basis of an accident\r\n  charge under the facts.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals as to this\r\n  issue.\r\nConclusion\r\n Based\r\n  on the foregoing, we affirm the court of appeals' decision as modified.\r\n BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that we should affirm the Court of Appeals'\r\n  decision which upheld petitioner's murder conviction, and agree that there was\r\n  no error in the refusal to charge accident here.Â  I also agree with the Court\r\n  of Appeals that any error in Dr. Nichols's testimony that &quot;suspicious\r\n  circumstances&quot; surrounding the victim's death were evidence of a homicide\r\n  was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the overwhelming evidence of\r\n  petitioner's guilt.Â  State v. Commander, 384 S.C. 66, 681 S.E.2d 31 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009).Â  I do not join that part of the majority's opinion that suggests\r\n  that a forensic pathologist's testimonyÂ  regarding the victimâ€™s anecdotal\r\n  history is always admissible under Rule 702, SCRE, as part of the pathologistâ€™s\r\n  opinion as to manner and cause of death.Â  I also do not agree that the term\r\n  â€œhomicideâ€ is necessarily a neutral term which does not imply death resulting\r\n  from the criminal act of another.Â  SeeÂ  Article 1, â€œHomicide,â€ of\r\n  Chapter 3, â€œOffenses Against the Person,â€ found in South Carolina Code Ann.\r\n  Title 16, â€œCRIMES AND OFFENSES.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] As noted by the court of appeals, &quot;mummification&quot; occurs after the\r\n  body dries out due to conditions of low level humidity such that the skin\r\n  surfaces remain intact and internal organs are preserved anatomically.Â  Dr.\r\n  Clay Nichols, the State's expert in forensic pathology, testified that the\r\n  Victim's body most likely became mummified after it lay undiscovered in her\r\n  heated home for several weeks.\r\n[2] Victim was pregnant at the time of her death, and the non-viable fetus was\r\n  discovered expelled between her legs. \r\n[3] While holding a gun to his head, Petitioner stated to the arresting officers,\r\n  &quot;Get out of the room, I'm going to kill myself like I killed Vonnie,&quot;\r\n  and, in the police car, &quot;I just did what I had to do.&quot;\r\n[4] Defense counsel stipulated to Dr. Nichols's\r\n  qualification as an expert in forensic pathology and did not question his\r\n  reliability. \r\n[5] The parties used the terms &quot;cause of death&quot; and &quot;manner of\r\n  death&quot; interchangeably.\r\n[6] In overruling defense counsel's objection,\r\n  the trial judge observed:\r\n\r\n. . . [H]e\r\n  has not said in his opinion it was a murder, which gets to intent and malice\r\n  and whether or not there was malice, but whether it was a homicide, in other\r\n  words, a death caused by someone else as opposed to an accidental or a natural\r\n  death. That's where I see the line being drawn.Â  And at this point in time, I\r\n  donâ€™t believe this witness has crossed that line.Â  But that definition [of\r\n  homicide]-that question needs to be asked [by counsel], or either the Court\r\n  needs to explain it to the jury.\r\n\r\n[7] Defense counsel did not object to this statement.\r\n[8] Under cross-examination by defense counsel, Presley testified:\r\n\r\nAnd he asked me a question, what\r\n  did I think, he wanted my opinion. If he had this lawyer . . . what did I think\r\n  if he told his lawyer to tell the State that his girlfriend . . . hit him in\r\n  the head with a stick and he fell unconscious and fell on her and when he\r\n  wasâ€”when he regained consciousness that she had died from suffocation because\r\n  he was on her, he fell on top of her. And I told him, no one is going to\r\n  believe this.\r\n\r\n[9] Our cases and statutes also stand for the proposition that &quot;homicide&quot;\r\n  does not necessarily connote criminality, even though our criminal justice\r\n  system categorizes homicide in varying degrees.Â  For example, murder is merely\r\n  one form of homicide.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (defining\r\n  &quot;murder&quot; as &quot;the killing of any person with malice\r\n    aforethought either express or implied.&quot;) (emphasis added); see\r\n      also State v. Elliott, 346 S.C. 603, 552 S.E.2d 727 (2001) (Pleicones, J.,\r\n  dissenting) (&quot;The recognition of these lesser grades of homicide,\r\n  and their accompanying lesser punishments, developed as the common law\r\n  recognized that some killings were more heinous than others: 'The distinction\r\n  between murder and manslaughter . . . is not merely an arbitrary rule, but is\r\n  founded on a thorough knowledge of the human heart, and framed in compassion to\r\n  the passions and frailties which belong to and are inseparable from our natures.'&quot;\r\n  (quoting State v. Ferguson, 20 S.C. Law (2 Hill) 619, 621-22 (1835)), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494\r\n  (2005); State v. Lee, 79 S.C. 223, 60 S.E. 524, 524\r\n    (1908) (affirming the following jury instruction: &quot;'Homicide,'\r\n  Mr. Foreman and gentlemen, is the killing of any human being.Â \r\n  Homicide may be felonious, may be justifiable, may be excusable. Murder is\r\n  felonious homicide, so is manslaughter. Both of them are\r\n  felonies.&quot;). \r\n[10] In Griggs, the Court\r\n  found the coroner unqualified to testify to the cause of death because he was\r\n  not a physician.Â  Id. at 313, 192 S.E. at 364 Â (&quot;We\r\n  do not find where any witness, not a physician, there being some doubt which\r\n  one of two injuries caused a death, has been permitted to give an opinion as to\r\n  the cause of death. This is as it should be. The juror of average intelligence\r\n  would be just as competent to reach a conclusion.&quot;).Â  Because the parties\r\n  stipulated to Dr. Nichols's qualification as an expert in this case, he was\r\n  qualified to render an opinion as to the cause and manner of death.\r\n[11] We note that Dr. Nichols did not base his opinion exclusively on the circumstantial information provided by the police officers at the\r\n  scene.Â  See State v. Vining, 645 A.2d 20,\r\n  20-21 (Me. 1994) (finding an expert's opinion &quot;amounted to an assessment\r\n  of the credibility and investigatory acumen of the police,&quot; and should\r\n  have been a question for the jury, where the physical examination was\r\n  inconclusive and the ultimate issue in the case was whether the victim was\r\n  pushed down a staircase by the defendant or accidentally fell, and the medical\r\n  examiner testified in her &quot;expert&quot; opinion that the victim's death\r\n  was a homicide based on her &quot;conversations with police\r\n  investigators&quot;); see also Rollins v. State, 897 A.2d 821,\r\n  848 (Md. 2006) (distinguishing Vining because the prosecution's expert\r\n  in forensic pathology used a process of elimination to exclude various\r\n  illnesses suffered by the elderly victim in conjunction with police reports to\r\n  ultimately arrive at the cause and manner of death).Â  \r\n[12] As part of the instruction, the trial judge directed the jurors not to &quot;place\r\n  any [expert] opinions above the idea of [their] own opinions on the\r\n  subject&quot; and to form their own conclusions after considering the expert\r\n  opinions in conjunction with all the other evidence in the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
