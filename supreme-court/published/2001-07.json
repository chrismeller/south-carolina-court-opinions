Condon, and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for\r\nthe Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n        William Grady Berry, pro se.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct filed formal charges against\r\nrespondent, (1) which respondent did not answer.  A hearing, which respondent did not attend, was held regarding the\r\ncharges.  The Panel recommended respondent be disbarred.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nNancy Christensen Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained to represent Nancy Christensen, who was involved in an automobile accident.  Christensen signed\r\na Fee Agreement which provided respondent would receive different fees depending on whether the matter was settled\r\nprior to filing a lawsuit or settled after a lawsuit had been filed.  The agreement also stated no fee would be due if a\r\nrecovery was not obtained.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the representation, Christensen had trouble communicating with respondent.  Her only personal meeting\r\nwith respondent was when she retained him.  Thereafter, she had only two telephone conversations with him, one of which\r\nwas an attempt by her to retrieve her client file.  Christensen also attempted to communicate with respondent by sending\r\nhim a letter that included a list of questions she had about her case, which respondent did not answer.  As a result of the\r\nlack of communication, Christensen requested her client file, but was told she could not have the file.\r\n\r\nChristensen sent a letter of termination to respondent, who refused to promptly relinquish her file.  A few days later, she\r\nspoke with respondent, who told her she would never find another lawyer to represent her interests and that he was going to\r\nput a lien on her file, so that \"nobody would touch it.\"  Christensen later retrieved her file and signed a \"Statement of\r\nReceipt,\" which included the statement:  \"lien placed on my file for $4,672.83 which includes time and costs.\"\r\n\r\nRespondent prepared a document entitled \"Attorney Time,\" which set forth the total lien amount, and stated the lien was\r\nbased upon one-third of a settlement offer by the insurance company, but which Christensen had rejected, plus costs. \r\nHowever, a review of respondent's client file did not show any supporting documentation for the costs.\r\n\r\nDuring the representation, respondent attempted to settle Christensen's case twice, without her knowledge or authorization.\r\n\r\nIn response to an inquiry by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (the ODC), respondent submitted a reply that offered a\r\nStatement for Services rendered to Christensen, which differed from the Statement in Christensen's file.  The Statement\r\nsubmitted to the ODC set forth entries for services that had not occurred.\r\n\r\nThe Panel found respondent's lien amount of $4,672.83 to be in excess of the Statement of Services prepared by\r\nrespondent.  The Panel further found that respondent failed to cooperate with the ODC's investigation into this matter.  The\r\nODC set up an appointment to meet with respondent; however, he did not appear for the appointment, nor did he\r\nreschedule it.  Thereafter, the ODC notified respondent and his attorney of a new time for the appointment; however,\r\nneither respondent nor his attorney appeared for the appointment or attempted to reschedule it.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Counsel (Edward King) Matter\r\n\r\nEdward King signed a Fee Agreement, which was similar to the agreement signed by Christensen, hiring respondent on a\r\ncontingency fee basis to represent him in an automobile accident matter.\r\n\r\nRespondent never met with King, and King attempted without success to contact respondent on numerous occasions.  King\r\nattempted to terminate the representation and request his file on three occasions.  He finally retrieved his file from the\r\ncourt-appointed Attorney to Protect Clients' Interests after respondent had been placed on interim suspension.\r\n\r\nKing later settled his automobile accident case for $40,000.  The insurance company paid him $40,000, less $4,284.67, the\r\namount respondent claimed as a lien.  The lien was based upon a settlement offer of $12,810, which King had rejected. \r\nRespondent had informed the insurance company's claims representative he no longer represented King and that he was\r\nplacing a lien on the case.  King's file was reviewed and little information was found to document any work done on behalf\r\nof King. (2)\r\n\r\nDiane Creel Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Diane Creel in a probate court matter (Action I), in which a hearing was held and an order later\r\nfiled.  There was also a separate action brought by the personal representative against Creel, docketed under the same civil\r\naction number, but seeking a different remedy (Action II).  Specifically, Action II was against Creel for the wrongful\r\nremoval of certain household furnishings from the decedent's residence.\r\n\r\nIn Action II, prior to a July 1997 hearing, respondent, as attorney for Creel, asked for a continuance on the ground of\r\nCreel's physical disability, and, by an order, consented to the continuance of the hearing.  Although respondent in fact\r\nrepresented Creel, he did not file an answer when Action II was filed, and he did not answer the personal representative's\r\naffidavit of default.\r\n\r\nDue to the default, a hearing was held on December 1, 1997, to ascertain damages in Action II.  A notice of the hearing was\r\nserved by mail on both respondent and his co-counsel.  By letter dated November 26, 1997, via facsimile, respondent\r\nnotified the personal representative's attorney that neither he nor his co-counsel were ever attorneys of record with regard\r\nto the hearing scheduled for December 1st.  The letter further stated, \"however, I have just been retained by Diane Creel in\r\nregard to representation in this matter.\"  Respondent also falsely stated in a letter that the hearing should be continued\r\nbecause he had a conflict in the Court of Common Pleas.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the personal representative's attorney wrote respondent a letter, with copies to the probate court and\r\nrespondent's co-counsel.  The attorney advised respondent that the probate judge had continued the hearing to January 13,\r\n1998.  The letter further stated,\r\n\r\nI do not understand your saying you do not represent Ms. Creel in this matter.  We have a letter from you dated July 16,\r\n1997, in which you ask for a continuance . . . If you or [co-counsel] do not represent Ms. Creel in this matter, I will have\r\nNotice served upon Ms. Creel of the new hearing date.  If I do not hear from you within the next five days, I will assume\r\nyou or [co-counsel] will be representing Ms. Creel in this matter.  I am forwarding a copy of this letter to [co-counsel].\r\n\r\nNeither respondent nor co-counsel responded to the letter.\r\n\r\nHowever, on January 13, 1998, respondent faxed a letter to the probate court, again falsely stating he did not represent\r\nCreel in Action II.  He stated:  \"Please be advised that my office has not been retained to represent Ms. Creel in connection\r\nwith the proceedings to be heard this afternoon.  However, this matter comes before the Court premature and the Probate\r\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to hear this matter at this time . . . .\"  The probate judge found respondent had represented to the\r\nprobate court that he represented Creel on at least three occasions.  The probate judge further found there had been no\r\nmotion filed by respondent or Creel relieving respondent as attorney.  Creel was found to be in default in Action II.\r\n\r\nThe Panel found respondent represented Creel and neglected her case by failing to file an Answer or otherwise respond on\r\nher behalf, and by failing to appear at the January 13th probate court hearing.  The Panel further found that Creel had\r\nadvanced a sum of money to respondent for costs, but never received an accounting from him as to how those funds were\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\nDomestic Violence Matter\r\n\r\nThe Panel found respondent had pled guilty to simple assault in magistrate's court after having been arrested for criminal\r\ndomestic violence.\r\n\r\nCriminal Convictions\r\n\r\nRespondent pled guilty to numerous narcotics offenses (3) and to the offense of criminal domestic violence.  The Panel found\r\nthe convictions for those crimes constituted convictions of serious crimes as defined by Rule 2 of Rule 413, SCACR, as\r\nwell as crimes of moral turpitude.\r\n\r\nNotice to Appear\r\n\r\nThe Panel found respondent failed to appear at a Notice to Appear, which was scheduled for April 13, 2000.\r\n\r\nPanel's Findings\r\n\r\nRegarding all matters, the Panel (4) found the following violations of Rule 7(a) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:  (1) violating a Rule of Professional Conduct; (2) willfully failing to appear personally\r\nfor a Notice to Appear as directed, and knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority; (3)\r\nbeing convicted of crimes of moral turpitude and serious crimes; (4) engaging in conduct tending to pollute the\r\nadministration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness\r\nto practice law; and (5) violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state.\r\n\r\nThe Panel further found respondent violated certain rules from the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.  The\r\nPanel found, regarding all matters, violations of Rule 8.4, misconduct, subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e).  The Panel\r\nfurther found violations of the following:  (1) Rule 1.2, scope of representation; (2) Rule 1.3, diligence; (3) Rule 1.4,\r\ncommunication; (4) Rule 1.5, fees; (5) Rule 3.3, candor toward a tribunal; (6) Rule 3.4, fairness to opposing party and\r\ncounsel; (7) Rule 4.1, truthfulness in statements to others; (8) Rule 4.2, communication with person represented by counsel;\r\nand (9) Rule 8.1(b), failure to respond to a demand from a disciplinary authority.  The Panel recommended respondent be\r\ndisbarred from the practice of law.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nRespondent's failure to answer the formal charges against \r\n  him constitutes an admission of the factual allegations. Rule 24(a) of the Rules \r\n  for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR. Further, because respondent \r\n  failed to appear at the hearing before the sub-panel, he is deemed to have admitted \r\n  the factual allegations which were to be the subject of such appearance and \r\n  to have conceded the merits of any recommendation to be considered at the hearing. \r\n  Rule 24(b) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n  As a result, we have only to determine the appropriate sanction for respondent. \r\n  See In re Hamer, 342 S.C. 437, 537 S.E.2d 552 (2000) (judge who failed \r\n  to respond to disciplinary charges was deemed to have admitted all allegations \r\n  in the complaints served upon her); In re Rast, 337 S.C. 588, 524 S.E.2d \r\n  619 (1999) (attorney's failure to answer the formal charges against him constitutes \r\n  default; the only issue is the proper sanction for attorney's neglect of his \r\n  duties).\r\n\r\nWe have deemed disbarment the appropriate sanction in similar \r\n  cases involving multiple acts of misconduct, including criminal violations. \r\n  See, e.g., In re Trexler, 343 S.C. 608, 541 S.E.2d 822 \r\n  (2001); In re Courtney, 342 S.C. 617, 538 S.E.2d 652 (2000); In re \r\n  Gibbes, 323 S.C. 80, 450 S.E.2d 588 (1994).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we disbar respondent from the practice of law.  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent\r\nshall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\ns/Jean H.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney\r\nGeneral Donald J. Zelenka, Senior Assistant Attorney General William E. Salter, III, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Walter\r\nM. Bailey, of Summerville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:  Benjamin was convicted of murder and armed robbery and respectively sentenced to life and thirty\r\nyears.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 7, 1997, Benjamin and a co-defendant, Tyrone Aiken, robbed the Sweetwater Citgo convenience store in Calhoun\r\nCounty.  Aiken shot and killed the store's employee, Dale Walker, and the two stole approximately $100.00 from the\r\nregister.  Benjamin and Aiken then went, along with several accomplices who had waited in the car during the robbery, and\r\nbought alcohol and drugs with the stolen money.  Several hours later, they robbed Dodger's Convenience store in\r\nOrangeburg County.  Benjamin was arrested the following day and gave a statement to police in which he admitted his\r\nparticipation in the robberies but claimed Aiken had shot Walker.  Benjamin was tried and convicted for the robbery and\r\nmurder at Sweetwater Citgo. (1)      \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Was the trial court's jury instruction concerning duress misleading?\r\n\r\n2.  Was Benjamin's statement to police taken in violation of his right to remain silent?\r\n\r\n3.  Was evidence of the subsequent robbery of Dodger's store improperly admitted?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DURESS INSTRUCTION  \r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Benjamin testified he only participated in the robbery because Aiken threatened to shoot him if he didn't. \r\nAccordingly, the trial court charged the jury on the defense of duress, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there's some talk about duress or coercion in this case.  Let me tell you what coercion or duress is.  Coercion means to\r\nexcuse a criminal act coercion must be present, eminent, and of such a nature as to induce a reasonable apprehension of\r\ndeath or serious, serious bodily harm if the act is not done.  There must be no reasonable way other than committing the\r\ncrime to escape the threat of harm but I do charge you, Mr. Foreman, members of the jury, that under the law of South\r\nCarolina duress is not a defense to the charge of murder. (2)  It could be a defense to the charge of robbery or armed robbery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense counsel objected to the language that duress could be a defense to robbery, asserting duress is, in fact a defense. \r\nThe trial court declined further instructions, finding the jury had understood the charge as given.\r\n\r\nA jury instruction must be viewed in the context \r\n  of the overall charge. State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 \r\n  (2000). The test for the sufficiency of a jury charge is what a reasonable juror \r\n  would have understood the charge to mean. Id. \r\n\r\nHere, it is patent the judge's statement that duress \"could be\" a defense was simply an attempt to clarify for the jury that,\r\nalthough duress could not be a defense to murder, it could be a defense to robbery and armed robbery.  We find reasonable\r\njurors would have interpreted the charge this way, such that the trial court committed no error. (3)  \r\n\r\n  2.   STATEMENT TO POLICE\r\n\r\nBenjamin next asserts his statement to SLED Agent \r\n  Mears was taken in violation of his right to remain silent contrary to Michigan \r\n  v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96 (1975). We disagree. \r\n\r\nAt a Jackson v. Denno \r\n  (4) hearing, Sheriff Jones testified that Benjamin was arrested at \r\n  approximately 1:30 pm on May 8, 1997 and taken to the sheriff's office. According \r\n  to Jones, when they got there, he asked Benjamin if \"he wanted to talk with \r\n  me,\" and Benjamin said \"No.\" Jones did not question Benjamin anymore, nor did \r\n  he advise Benjamin of his Miranda (5) \r\n  rights. Jones testified Benjamin never requested an attorney. \r\n\r\nJones contacted SLED Agent Mears, who was investigating \r\n  the case, and advised Mears to meet them at the sheriff's office. Mears arrived \r\n  at the sheriff's office at approximately 2:30 pm and was advised that Sheriff \r\n  Jones had not interviewed Benjamin. Benjamin then agreed to talk to Mears and \r\n  was advised of his Miranda rights. Benjamin gave oral and written statements \r\n  confessing to the crime. At no time, according to Mears, did Benjamin request \r\n  counsel. \r\n\r\nBenjamin asserts his statement was taken in violation of his right to remain silent because it was taken by Agent Mears\r\nafter Benjamin had indicated he did not wish to talk to Sheriff Jones.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan v. Mosley, supra, the \r\n  United States Supreme Court held that the fact that a suspect invokes his right \r\n  to remain silent is not a permanent bar to police reinitiating contact with \r\n  the suspect. The Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A reasonable and faithful interpretation of the \r\n    Miranda opinion must rest on the intention of the Court in that case \r\n    to adopt \"fully effective means . . . to notify the person of his right of \r\n    silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously \r\n    honored. . . .\" The critical safeguard identified in the passage at \r\n    issue is a person's \"right to cut off questioning.\" Through \r\n    the exercise of his option to terminate questioning he can control the time \r\n    at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the \r\n    interrogation. The requirement that law enforcement authorities must respect \r\n    a person's exercise of that option counteracts the coercive pressures of the \r\n    custodial setting. We therefore conclude that the admissibility of statements \r\n    obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends \r\n    under Miranda on whether his \"right to cut off questioning\" \r\n    was \"scrupulously honored.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n423 U.S. at 102-104 (citations omitted, emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nCourts interpreting Mosley have set forth \r\n  five factors to analyze to ascertain whether the defendant's right to cut off \r\n  questioning was \"scrupulously honored\": (1) whether the suspect was given Miranda \r\n  warnings at the first interrogation; (2) whether police immediately ceased the \r\n  interrogation when the suspect indicated he did not want to answer questions; \r\n  (3) whether police resumed questioning the suspect only after the passage of \r\n  a significant period of time; (4) whether police provided a fresh set of Miranda \r\n  warnings before the second interrogation; and (5) whether the second interrogation \r\n  was restricted to a crime that had not been a subject of the earlier interrogation. \r\n  Burket v. Angelone, 208 F.3d 172 (4th Cir. 2000). See&nbsp;also \r\n  Roundtree v. Commonwealth, 2000 WL 724026 (Va. App. 2000); Wisconsin \r\n  v. Badker, 2000 WL 1790013 (Wis. App. 2000); State v. Brooks, 505 \r\n  So.2d 714, 722 (La.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 947, 108 S.Ct. 337, 98 L.Ed.2d \r\n  363 (1987). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Mosley factors are not exclusively \r\n  controlling, nor do they establish a test which can be woodenly applied. State \r\n  v. Koput, 396 N.W.2d 773, 776 (Wis. Ct. App. 1986). Rather, the factors \r\n  provide a framework for determining whether, under the circumstances, an accused's \r\n  right to silence was scrupulously honored. Id.\r\n\r\n\"[A] second interrogation is not rendered unconstitutional \r\n  simply because it involves the same subject matter discussed during the first \r\n  interview.\" Jackson v. Wyrick, 730 F.2d 1177, 1180 (8th Cir.), cert. \r\n  denied, 469 U.S. 849 (1984) (unless police wear down defendant by repeatedly \r\n  questioning on same subject after invocation of rights, no violation of Miranda \r\n  to reinterrogate); United States v. Finch, 557 F.2d 1234 (8th Cir.) (as \r\n  long as new Miranda warnings are given and initial request to remain silent \r\n  is scrupulously honored, statements from subsequent interrogations on same subject \r\n  are admissible), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 927, 98 S.Ct. 409, 54 L.Ed.2d \r\n  285 (1977); Mills v. Commonwealth, 996 S.W.2d 473 (Ky 1999), cert. \r\n  denied, 120 S.Ct. 1182 (2000) (no Miranda violation where defendant spoke \r\n  with second officer, after invoking right to remain silent with first officer, \r\n  though encounter with second officer came only about 20 minutes after invocation \r\n  of right and involved same crime); State v. Pierce, 364 N.W.2d 801 (Minn. \r\n  1985) (suspect reinterrogated 2 hours after initial attempt about same crime. \r\n  . . . no undue pressure and defendant's right to cut off questioning was scrupulously \r\n  honored); People v. Foster, 518 N.E.2d 82 (1987), cert. denied, \r\n  486 U.S. 1047 (1988) (resumption of questioning 3 hours later about same crime); \r\n  State v. Isaac, 465 So.2d 1384 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985)(questioning \r\n  resumed 1hour, 40 minutes later about same crime). See&nbsp;also \r\n  United States v. Schwensow, 151 F.3d 650, 659 (7th Cir.1998) (constitutionality \r\n  of subsequent police interview depends not on its subject matter, but rather \r\n  on whether the police in conducting the interview sought to undermine the suspect's \r\n  resolve to remain silent.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1059 (1998).\r\n\r\nHere, under the totality of the circumstances, \r\n  we find Benjamin's right to remain silent was \"scrupulously honored,\" such that \r\n  he had the \"right to cut off questioning at any time.\" No Miranda warnings \r\n  were given by Sheriff Jones because Benjamin indicated he did not wish to speak \r\n  to him. Upon being told Benjamin didn't want to talk to him, Sheriff Jones immediately \r\n  ceased talking to him. Further, there was no immediate resumption of questioning \r\n  by police. At least one hour later, (6) Agent \r\n  Mears arrived and read Benjamin his Miranda rights, having him initial \r\n  after each sentence. Benjamin signed all the waivers, and gave both oral and \r\n  handwritten confessions. \r\n\r\nWe concur with those courts, cited above, which \r\n  hold that a subsequent interrogation concerning the same crime does not, in \r\n  and of itself, violate an accused's right to remain silent. What is paramount \r\n  is that police, under the totality of the circumstances,\"scrupulously honor\" \r\n  the suspects's right to remain silent. We find, under the totality of the circumstances \r\n  presented here, police fully complied with the mandates of Michigan v. Mosley. \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly admitted Benjamin's statement. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.  EVIDENCE OF DODGER'S ROBBERY\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Benjamin asserts the trial court improperly admitted evidence of the armed robbery of Dodger's Convenience Store\r\nwhich occurred  several hours after the robbery/murder at Sweetwater Citgo.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe robbery and murder at Sweetwater Citgo occurred between midnight and 1:00 am on May 7, 1997.  Benjamin and his\r\ncohorts stole approximately $100.00 from the store and used the money to buy cocaine and marijuana.  At approximately\r\n4:30 am, they drove to Orangeburg where Aiken and Benjamin robbed Dodger's Convenience Store; however, they\r\ninadvertently stole the wrong part of the cash register and obtained no money.  As they left the store with the register,\r\nAiken dropped the gun which had been used in the Sweetwater Citgo robbery and murder.  Aiken testified they robbed\r\nDodger's in order to obtain money for more drugs.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the State presented the testimony of the Dodger's clerk, Cecily McMillan.  She positively identified Benjamin,\r\ntestifying that when she attempted to run from her assailants, Benjamin was screaming at her telling her to \"get [your] ass\r\nback here before [I] have to come back and get [you].\"  She also testified Benjamin looked like he was \"up pretty bad\r\nmood, like was angry about something.\" \r\n\r\nBenjamin asserts the probative value of McMillan's testimony was outweighed by its prejudicial value.  We disagree.  We\r\nfind McMillan's testimony was properly admitted for numerous reasons. (7)\r\n\r\nFirst, Benjamin's defense to the charges here was \r\n  that, although he participated in the crimes, he did so under duress, fearing \r\n  Aiken would harm him if he did not go along. McMillan's testimony tended to \r\n  demonstrate that Benjamin was a willing participant, thereby rebutting Benjamin's \r\n  claim that he acted under duress. (8) Accordingly, \r\n  this testimony was properly admitted to demonstrate Benjamin's intent pursuant \r\n  to State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923). See also \r\n  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000)(evidence of other \r\n  bad acts is admissible when it tends to establish motive, identity, a common \r\n  scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent).\r\n\r\nMoreover, we find testimony concerning the subsequent robbery was admissible as part of the res gestae.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  As noted by this Court in Hough, supra:\r\n\r\nOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence of other crimes arises when such evidence furnishes part of the\r\ncontext of the crime or is necessary to a full presentation of the case, or is so intimately connected with and explanatory of\r\nthe crime charged against the defendant and is so much a part of the setting of the case and its environment that its proof is\r\nappropriate in order to complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context or the res gestae or the\r\nuncharged offense is so linked together in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged that one cannot be fully\r\nshown without proving the other . . . [and is thus] part of the res gestae of the crime charged.  And where evidence is\r\nadmissible to provide this full presentation of the offense, [t]here is no reason to fragmentize the event under inquiry by\r\nsuppressing parts of the res gestae.  \r\n\r\n\r\n325 S.C. at 92, 480 S.E.2d at 79. Here, the weapon used, and left behind at the Dodger's store,  was also the weapon used\r\nin the robbery/murder at Sweetwater Citgo such that testimony concerning the weapon was necessary to a full presentation\r\nof the State's case. (9)  Accordingly, we find evidence of the subsequent robbery was properly admitted. (10)\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin's remaining issue is affirmed pursuant \r\n  to SCACR Rule 220(b)(1) and the following authority: State v. Locke, \r\n  341 S.C. 54, 533 S.E.2d 324 (2000). Benjamin's convictions and sentences are\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.    \r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I agree with the result reached by the majority in this case.  However, because I would analyze\r\nISSUE 3 differently, I write separately.\r\n\r\nI would hold that Cecily McMillan's testimony recounting the events of the Dodger's robbery was admissible under Rule\r\n404(b) SCRE only to show identity.  McMillan testified that two men, one very tall and the other much shorter, robbed\r\nDodger's.  She testified that the taller man was armed with a pistol while committing the offense.  Tyrone Aiken, who is\r\nmuch taller than Benjamin, testified that he and Benjamin robbed both the Sweetwater Citgo and Dodger's, and that only\r\nhe had been armed during the crimes.  He further testified that, while fleeing Dodger's, he lost the pistol used in the\r\nrobberies.  Police found a pistol on the ground outside of Dodger's.  The State's ballistics expert testified that the gun\r\nfound outside of Dodger's was the gun used in the Sweetwater Citgo killing.  Eyewitnesses testified to seeing two men, one\r\nvery tall and one very short, walking across the parking lot, towards the Sweetwater Citgo shortly before the robbery.  The\r\nclerk in the Sweetwater Citgo testified that two men, one armed and much taller than the other, committed the Sweetwater\r\nCitgo robbery.  In light of this evidence, McMillan's testimony concerning the descriptions of the Dodger's perpetrators\r\nwas admissible under SCRE 404(b) to show the identity of the Sweetwater Citgo robbers.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it was error to allow McMillan to \r\n  repeat what was said inside Dodger's because the prejudicial impact of the statement \r\n  substantially outweighed its probative value. See Rule 403, SCRE. Nevertheless, \r\n  in light of the overwhelming evidence presented against Benjamin, the error \r\n  in admitting the statement was harmless.\r\n\r\nThe majority finds that McMillan's testimony was admissible because McMillan's testimony rebutted Benjamin's defense\r\nof duress, and was admissible as part of the res gestae.\r\n\r\nBecause the Dodger's robbery occurred after \r\n  the Sweetwater Citgo robbery, I am not persuaded that Benjamin's actions at \r\n  Dodger's were inconsistent with his claim that he was acting under duress when \r\n  he committed the Sweetwater Citgo robbery.\r\n\r\nWere he on trial for the Dodger's robbery, the statements attributed to Benjamin by McMillan would be admissible to rebut\r\nBenjamin's defense of duress, assuming Benjamin proffered such a defense.  That is not the case here.  Benjamin was not\r\non trial for the Dodger's robbery.  The majority superimposes Benjamin's claim that he was acting under duress when he\r\nentered the Sweetwater Citgo over his participation in the Dodger's robbery.  It then finds that evidence admissible to rebut\r\nthe latter claim, i.e., evidence suggesting Benjamin was not acting under duress during the Dodger's robbery, is likewise\r\nadmissible to rebut his claim of duress in the Sweetwater Citgo robbery.  I would hold that evidence of Benjamin's\r\nparticipation in the Dodger's robbery is not admissible to rebut his claim that he acted under duress in committing the\r\nSweetwater Citgo robbery.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the evidence of the Dodger's robbery was not \"necessary to a full presentation of the State's case\" (11) in the\r\nSweetwater Citgo crime, such as to make the challenged evidence admissible under a res gestae exception to Rule 404(b),\r\nSCRE.  The majority, in footnote 9, employs an estoppel analysis and finds that because Benjamin, in his appeal in the\r\nDodger's case, argued that the crimes were part of a single continuous crime spree, he cannot now challenge a finding that\r\nthe evidence was admissible, under a res gestae exception, since the crimes \"would be 'so linked together in point of time\r\nand circumstances' that one could not be shown without proving the other.\"  While I agree that one cannot advance\r\nconflicting factual arguments simply because his interests have changed, (12) I do not agree that Benjamin has somehow lost\r\nhis right to challenge the contested evidence because he has asserted, on appeal in a different case, that the acts were part of\r\na single crime spree.\r\n\r\nI do, however, agree with the result reached by the majority, and would affirm the trial court's decision because, in my\r\nopinion, evidence of the Dodger's incident was admissible to establish the identity of the Sweetwater Citgo perpetrators. \r\nBecause its prejudicial impact substantially outweighed its probative value, the content of Benjamin's statement directed\r\ntoward the Dodger's clerk was not admissible.  Nonetheless, in light of the competent evidence presented by the State, the\r\nerror in admitting the statement was harmless.\r\n1.  He was separately tried \r\n  for the Dodger's robbery. His conviction and sentence were affirmed in State \r\n  v. Benjamin, 341 S.C. 160, 533 S.E.2d 606 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\n2.  See State v. Kelsey, \r\n  331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998);&nbsp;State v. Robinson, 294 S.C. 120, \r\n  363 S.E.2d 104 (1987)(holding duress is not a defense to murder). \r\n3.   Although we find no error, the better practice is to refrain from the use of terms such as \"could be\" or \"might be\" a\r\ndefense.  We suggest the following instruction in cases in which the defense of duress is raised:\r\n\r\n\r\nTo establish duress which will excuse a criminal act, the degree of coercion must be present, imminent, and of such a\r\nnature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily harm if the act is not done.  Coercion is no\r\ndefense if there is any reasonable way, other than committing the crime, to escape the threat of harm.  The fear of injury\r\nmust be reasonable.\r\n\r\n4.   378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n5.  Miranda v. Arizona, \r\n  384 U.S. 436 (1966). \r\n6.  The suspect in Mosley \r\n  was approached by police approximately two hours after his initial invocation \r\n  of his right to remain silent. Here, Agent Mears approached Benjamin approximately \r\n  1hour and 15 minutes after Benjamin told Sheriff Jones he didn't wish to speak \r\n  with him. \r\n7.  The concurrence contends \r\n  McMillan's testimony was admissible only insofar as it demonstrated identity. \r\n  However, as Benjamin admitted his participation in the robberies, identity was \r\n  not an issue in this case, and McMillan's testimony was not admissible for this \r\n  purpose. See Carter v. State, 323 S.C. 465, 476 S.E.2d 916 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996) (testimony of other bad acts not admissible to prove identity under \r\n  Lyle where identity not in issue); cf. State v. Langley, \r\n  334 S.C. 643, 515 S.E.2d 98 (1999) (where victim's identity not an issue, evidence \r\n  not admissible for that purpose); State v. Livingston, 327 S.C. 17, 488 \r\n  S.E.2d 313 (1997) (same). Moreover, we fail to see that McMillan's description \r\n  of the robbers as \"one short and one tall\" is sufficient to demonstrate identity. \r\n8.  The concurrence asserts \r\n  evidence of Benjamin's conduct during the robbery of Dodger's is not relevant \r\n  to his claim of duress during the earlier robbery of Sweetwater Citgo. We disagree. \r\n  Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable \r\n  some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears. State v. \r\n  Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, 342 S.E.2d 401 (1986). All that is required is that \r\n  the fact shown tends to make more or less probable some matter \r\n  in issue and to bear directly or indirectly thereon. It is not required that \r\n  the inference sought should necessarily follow from the fact proved. Evidence \r\n  is relevant if it makes the desired inference more probable than it would be \r\n  without the evidence. State v. Hamilton, 543 S.E.2d 586, 591(Ct. App. \r\n  2001) (citing Jon P. Thames &amp; W.M. Von Zharen, A Guide to Evidence \r\n  Law in South Carolina 28 (1987)).\r\n\r\nHere, the fact that Benjamin was a willing, active participant in the Dodger's robbery tends to make less probable his claim\r\nthat he acted under duress just a few hours earlier during the robbery of the Sweetwater Citgo.  Accordingly, we find it was\r\nproperly admitted to rebut his claim of duress.\r\n9.  In his appeal of the robbery \r\n  of Dodger's, Benjamin maintained the robbery was \"merely part of a single continuous \r\n  crime spree.\" 341 S.C. at ___, 533 S.E.2d at 607. If, as Benjamin claims, the \r\n  crimes were one continuous spree, then they are clearly \"so linked together \r\n  in point of time and circumstances\" that one cannot fully be shown without proving \r\n  the other. Hough, supra. \r\n\r\nContrary to the concurrence's assertion, our notation of Benjamin's argument in the Dodger's appeal in no way constitutes\r\nan estoppel of his ability to challenge the contested evidence in this case.  We simply highlight his argument to demonstrate\r\nthe applicability of the res gestae exception.\r\n10.  Finally, notwithstanding \r\n  its view that much of Cecily McMillan's testimony was improperly admitted, the \r\n  concurrence finds the error was harmless \"in light of the competent evidence \r\n  presented by the State.\" If, however, McMillan's testimony as to what Benjamin \r\n  said inside the Dodger's store were excluded, then there was no testimony rebutting \r\n  his claim of duress. Accordingly, it simply cannot be said that the jury would \r\n  necessarily have rejected Benjamin's claim of duress, such that any error could \r\n  not be deemed harmless. See Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 \r\n  S.E.2d 834 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 927 (1993) (error is harmless \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained). \r\n11.

Lucka, of Charleston, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  This case involves an order by petitioner's (City's) Building Official requiring respondent Grant to\r\nevacuate all residential occupants and remove all kitchen improvements in the downstairs level of a building Grant owns in\r\nCity.  After a hearing, City's Zoning Board of Adjustment (Board) denied Grant's request to overturn the Building\r\nOfficial's order and the circuit court affirmed.  In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and\r\nreversed in part.  We granted City's petition for a writ of certiorari and now reverse. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Grant purchased a two-story building located within City.  At that time, the building contained three apartments on\r\nthe second floor.  Three units (A, B, and C) were located on the ground floor.  Unit A had a bath, kitchen, wall heater, and\r\nair conditioner.  Unit C contained a kitchen.  The previous owner had rented the three second floor apartments, lived in\r\nUnit C, and rented Unit A to residential tenants.  \r\n\r\nBefore purchasing the property, Grant requested a written opinion from City's Building Official regarding whether an ice\r\ncream shop could be located in the lower level of the building.  By letter, City's then Building Official, Forrest Tucker,\r\nresponded:\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .  regarding your desire to situate an ice cream shop in the lower level . . . \r\n\r\n. . . my initial concern focussed [sic] on locating a commercial activity below the base flood elevation (BFE) in what\r\nappears to be a residential structure.  I have reviewed the matter with the Atlanta office of FEMA and jointly, we have\r\nconcluded that your venture does not appear to violate any of our community regulations.  Since less than 75% of this\r\nstructure is devoted to residential use, it is classified as a non-residential structure.  Accordingly, properly flood proofed\r\nuses below the BFE would be allowed.  \r\n\r\nAs to whether you must properly flood proof the lower level in concert with all requirements for new construction, the\r\nanswer is \"no\" provided your renovations do not exceed 50% of the structure's pre-improvement value.  As long as you do\r\nnot exceed the 50% threshold, you may locate your ice cream shop in the lower level without complying with the\r\nmandatory flood proofing provisions of new construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter he purchased the property, Grant received building permits from City and made improvements to the ground floor\r\nunits.  One of the permits describes \"Downstairs Apt. #1\" as the location of the job.  Grant added bathrooms to Units B and\r\nC and upgraded the kitchen sink in Unit C.  A tenant installed a kitchen in Unit B.  Grant did not locate an ice cream store\r\nin the building.  From June 1994 to June 1995, he rented the units to commercial tenants. \r\n\r\nBy letter dated January 3, 1996, Tom Hall, City's current Building Official, notified Grant as follows:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe building . . . is a post FIRM building and the down stairs [sic] may not be used for any occupancy other than\r\ncommercial.  The commercial tenants may not use the downstairs as a commercial live-in.\r\n\r\nConsequently, you have until Monday, January 8th at noon to evacuate all residential occupants and by February 3, 1996 the\r\nowner of the building must show a plan to remove all the kitchen improvements downstairs.  The bath-rooms [sic], which\r\nare is [sic] allowed in commercial space may remain. (1)    \r\n\r\n\r\nGrant appealed the notice.  At the Board hearing, Hall testified he had seen residents living in the three downstairs units. \r\nAccording to Hall, City's zoning/flood ordinance precludes living space, plumbing, and electrical connections for\r\nresidential purposes below the base flood elevation (BFE).  Hall further testified the letter from the former Building\r\nOfficial approving the downstairs units for use as an ice cream shop was in error. \r\n\r\nGrant testified he wanted Unit A to remain residential and Units B and C to be designated for commercial purposes.  He\r\nstated he did not believe the kitchens in Units B and C should have to be removed because he was told an ice cream store,\r\nwhich he asserts requires a kitchen, could be placed in those locations.  Grant admitted he bought the property without\r\nreading City's flood regulations.  \r\n\r\nIn its written order, the Board concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Grant's] request to overturn the order of the Building Official with respect to evacuation of the tenants and removal of the\r\nkitchens is hereby denied.  All tenants must be evacuated and all kitchens, for all purposes  - - residential and commercial,\r\nmust be removed. \r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Did the Court of Appeals err in holding South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 6-7-760 (1977) requires the Board to file a\r\ntranscript with the clerk of the circuit court?  \r\n\r\n2.   Did the Court of Appeals err in remanding this matter to the Board to hear evidence on Grant's estoppel claims?     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1. Failure to file transcript\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals remanded this case for reconstruction of the record because the Board failed to file with the circuit\r\ncourt a transcript of the hearing as required under Â§ 6-7-760.  City claims this was error. \r\n\r\nSection 6-7-760 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Upon the filing of such an appeal [from the board \r\n    of adjustment], the clerk of the circuit court shall give immediate notice \r\n    thereof to the secretary of the board and within thirty days from the time \r\n    of such notice the board shall cause to be filed with the clerk a duly certified \r\n    copy of the proceedings had before . . . . the board of adjustment, including \r\n    a transcript of the evidence heard before it, if any, and the decision \r\n    of the board. (2) \r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  \r\n\r\n  The Court of Appeals held this section requires that a transcript be filed if evidence was heard before the Board.  City\r\nasserts that a transcript must be filed only if one has been prepared at the Board's discretion.  In construing this statute, City\r\ncontends the phrase \"if any\" modifies the noun \"transcript,\" not the phrase \"of the evidence heard before it.\"  We agree\r\nwith City's proposed construction of Â§ 6-7-760.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  for the Court to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. Mid-State \r\n  Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 476 S.E.2d 690 (1996). \r\n  If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite \r\n  meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation \r\n  and the Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning. Miller \r\n  v. Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 441 S.E.2d 319 (1994). Where a statute is ambiguous, \r\n  however, we must construe the terms of the statute according to settled rules \r\n  of construction. Lester v. South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n, \r\n  334 S.C. 557, 514 S.E.2d 751, (1999). It is well-settled that statutes dealing \r\n  with the same subject matter are in pari materia and must be construed \r\n  together, if possible, to produce a single, harmonious result. Joiner v. \r\n  Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000). \r\n\r\nWe find the language of  Â§ 6-7-760 ambiguous and, under our rules of statutory construction, determine it should not be\r\nconstrued to mandate the preparation of a transcript.  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-7-740 (1977), (3) the legislature has\r\ninstructed that the Board \"shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be\r\nimmediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.\"  In specifying the Board's duties at the time of the\r\nhearing, the legislature has imposed no requirement that a verbatim recording be made.  Any party wishing to appeal a\r\ndecision of the Board has access to the record provided under Â§ 6-7-740.  Reading Â§ 6-7-760 together with Â§ 6-7-740, as we\r\nmust, we conclude the legislature intended that preparation of a transcript remains within the Board's discretion.  \r\n\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals erred in holding a transcript must be filed when there is an appeal to the circuit court.  In light\r\nof this conclusion, the remand for reconstruction of the record ordered by the Court of Appeals is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. Estoppel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn affirming the Board's decision, the circuit court rejected Grant's assertion that City was estopped to order the exclusion\r\nof residential tenants and the removal of kitchens.  On appeal of the circuit court's order, the Court of Appeals remanded to\r\nthe Board to \"hear evidence on and consider Grant's estoppel claim.\"  City argues this was error.  We agree.  Because we\r\nfind the record adequate to review this issue, remand is not necessary and we affirm on the merits as follows.\r\n\r\nGrant agrees City's ordinance precludes residential tenants from living in the ground floor units of his building.  He claims,\r\nhowever, that City should be estopped from precluding residential use of Unit A because City officials issued building\r\npermits allowing residential use of that unit.  Grant further claims City issued building permits for kitchens in Units B and\r\nC and rendered a written opinion allowing kitchens in those units. \r\n\r\nAs a general rule, estoppel does not lie against \r\n  the government to prevent the due exercise of its police power or to thwart \r\n  the application of public policy. South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. \r\n  Parker, 275 S.C. 176, 268 S.E.2d 282 (1980). This does not mean that estoppel \r\n  cannot apply against a government agency. Landing Dev. Corp. v. City of Myrtle \r\n  Beach, 285 S.C. 216, 329 S.E.2d 423 (1985). To prove estoppel against the \r\n  government, the relying party must prove (1) lack of knowledge and of the means \r\n  of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question, (2) justifiable reliance \r\n  upon the government's conduct, and (3) a prejudicial change in position. Midlands \r\n  Utility, Inc. v. South Carolina Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, 298 \r\n  S.C. 66, 378 S.E.2d 256 (1989). Because we find Grant failed to meet the first \r\n  element of estoppel, we affirm the circuit court's order.\r\n\r\nTwo pertinent cases address the first element of \r\n  estoppel. In Abbeville Arms v. City of Abbeville, 273 S.C. 491, 257 S.E.2d \r\n  716 (1979), Abbeville Arms obtained an option to purchase real property with \r\n  the intent to construct a multi-family housing project on property zoned R-6 \r\n  High Density Residential. After it reviewed the Abbeville zoning ordinance, \r\n  the official zoning map, and obtained a letter from the zoning administrator, \r\n  Abbeville Arms applied for a building permit. Five days later, the city council \r\n  adopted a resolution stating that, through inadvertence and neglect, the official \r\n  zoning map was defective and the subject property was actually zoned R-8 Medium \r\n  Density Residential, thereby prohibiting the housing project. \r\n\r\nIn discussing the first element of estoppel, we \r\n  noted Abbeville Arms had checked the zoning ordinance, including the official \r\n  zoning map, which indicated the property was zoned R-6 High Density Residential. \r\n  Through correspondence with the City zoning administrator, Abbeville Arms confirmed \r\n  the zoning for its project. We concluded \"it is clear that the defect [on the \r\n  zoning map] was latent and that respondent lacked knowledge and the means of \r\n  knowledge as to its existence.\" Id. at 494, 257 S.E.2d at 718. We held \r\n  the city was estopped to deny Abbeville Arms a building permit.\r\n\r\nLanding Dev. Corp. v. City of Myrtle Beach, \r\n  supra, involved the development of condominium units for short-term \r\n  rentals in a district zoned for \"one, two and multi-family dwellings including \r\n  . . . condominiums . . . for permanent occupancy.\" The zoning ordinance did \r\n  not define \"permanent occupancy\" and there was no law equating \"permanent occupancy\" \r\n  with occupancy by a permanent resident. When asked if rentals were permitted \r\n  in the district, the Director of Zoning and Housing for Myrtle Beach indicated \r\n  they were and eventually issued business licenses to permit short-term rentals. \r\n  The Director later informed respondents that short-term rentals were not permitted. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn concluding Myrtle Beach was estopped from denying business licenses for short-term rentals, we held:  \r\n\r\n\r\n[r]espondents lacked the knowledge or means to know that short-term vacation rentals were prohibited in the A-3 District.\r\nThe only definitive source of information concerning the interpretation and enforcement of the ordinance was [the\r\nDirector].  \r\n\r\n\r\n285 S.C. at 220, 329 S.E.2d at 425.\r\n\r\nIn this case, City issued a building permit for \r\n  work in \"Downstairs Apt. #1.\" Assuming the permit's reference to an \"apartment\" \r\n  misled Grant into believing residential use was permitted in Unit A, issuance \r\n  of the permit does not estop City from enforcing its zoning/flood ordinance \r\n  which precludes residential use of the downstairs floor. Grant could have easily \r\n  ascertained the flood limitations on his building by reviewing the zoning/flood \r\n  ordinance. Unlike the developers in Landing Dev. Corp. and Abbeville \r\n  Arms, Grant had the means but failed to obtain this information. Accordingly, \r\n  we conclude City is not estopped from excluding residential use of Unit A. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, the building permits issued by City for \r\n  Units B and C describe the work to be done as \"plumbing,\" \"HVAC,\" and \"additional \r\n  wiring for electrical circuits.\" There is no reference to kitchens. By issuing \r\n  these permits, City did not approve their installation. Although City agrees \r\n  it is bound by its former Building Official's written opinion approving Grant's \r\n  downstairs units for an ice cream shop, that opinion does not approve installation \r\n  of a kitchen. Town of Sullivan's Island v. Byrum, 306 S.C. 539, 413 S.E.2d \r\n  325 (Ct. App. 1992) (town not estopped from challenging use of garage as apartment \r\n  where no evidence of any statement or conduct by town that reasonably misled \r\n  homeowner into believing garage apartment was a permitted use). We conclude \r\n  City is not estopped from prohibiting kitchens in the downstairs level of Grant's \r\n  building. (4)  \r\n\r\nThe Board's decision is supported by the evidence. \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court upholding the Board's order is affirmed. \r\n  Bannum, Inc., v. City of Columbia, 335 S.C. 202, 516 S.E.2d 439 (1999) \r\n  (appellate court will not disturb the findings of the Board of Adjustment unless \r\n  such findings or decision resulted from board action which is arbitrary, an \r\n  abuse of discretion, illegal, or in excess of lawfully delegated authority); \r\n  Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Comm'n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, \r\n  459 S.E.2d 841 (1995) (Supreme Court will not reverse circuit court's affirmance \r\n  of zoning board unless board's findings of fact have no evidentiary support \r\n  or board commits an error of law). (5) The Court \r\n  of Appeals' decision is\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  BURNETT, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in\r\na separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT: (concurring in part and dissenting in part).  I concur in part and dissent in part.  I concur with the\r\nmajority regarding Grant's estoppel claim.  I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's conclusion which allows a\r\nzoning board to produce a transcript of a hearing solely at its own discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\nIn relevant part, South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 6-7-760 (1977) provides:\r\n\r\n  Upon the filing of such an appeal [from the \r\n    board of adjustment], the clerk of the circuit court shall give immediate \r\n    notice thereof to the secretary of the board and within thirty days from the \r\n    time of such notice the board shall cause to be filed with the clerk a \r\n    duly certified copy of the proceedings had before . . . . the board of adjustment, \r\n    including a transcript of the evidence heard before it, if any, and the \r\n    decision of the board. (6) \r\n\r\n\r\n(Underline added).  \r\n\r\n\"If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, \r\n  and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing \r\n  rules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to look for or \r\n  impose another meaning.\" Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, \r\n  436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995). However, where the language of an act gives \r\n  rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court \r\n  may search for that intent beyond the borders of the act itself. The Lite \r\n  House, Inc., v. J.C. Roy, Co., 309 S.C. 50, 419 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 1992). \r\n\r\n\r\nA statute as a whole must receive a practical, \r\n  reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and \r\n  policy of lawmakers. Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., of Florence, 332 S.C. \r\n  75, 504 S.E.2d 311 (1998). \"Any ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in \r\n  favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial operation of the law.\" Bennett \r\n  v. Sullivan's Island Bd. of Adjustment, 313 S.C. 455, 458, 438 S.E.2d 273, \r\n  274 (Ct. App. 1993). In giving effect to legislative intent, the court is constrained \r\n  to avoid an absurd result. South Carolina Tax Comm'n v. Gaston Copper Recycling \r\n  Corp., 316 S.C. 163, 447 S.E.2d 843 (1994). \r\n\r\nThe majority and I agree that Section 6-7-760 is ambiguous.  As noted by the majority, \"if any\" arguably modifies the noun\r\n\"transcript;\" alternatively, \"if any\" modifies the phrase, \"evidence heard before it.\"   \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the most reasonable interpretation of Â§ 6-7-760 is that the legislature intended to require a zoning board to\r\nprepare and file a transcript with the circuit court whenever evidence was presented before it and its decision is appealed. \r\nRequiring a zoning board to file a transcript if it prepares one leaves the production of a verbatim transcript at the discretion\r\nof the zoning board, a result I find the legislature could not have intended.  My interpretation is entirely consistent with Â§ 6-7-740 which requires zoning boards to keep public records of its hearings and other official actions.  In compliance with\r\nthis section, zoning boards can record evidentiary proceedings then transcribe the recording if a decision is appealed. (7)    \r\n\r\nBecause of my interpretation of Â§ 6-7-760, I necessarily must address City's question whether the Court of Appeals erred\r\nby concluding the circuit court should have remanded this matter to the Board for rehearing after Grant encountered\r\nhostility while attempting to reconstruct the record.  \r\n\r\n                    At the initial hearing before the circuit court, the parties agreed the tape recording from the Board hearing was of\r\npoor quality and could not be transcribed.  Accordingly, Grant moved to either reconstruct the record or hold a new\r\nhearing.  The circuit court allowed Grant to reconstruct the record by stipulation, affidavit, or transcript.  \r\n\r\nAt the second hearing, Grant's attorney stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . it was a bit difficult to supplement the record, Your Honor.  I guess one explanation might be that these were not\r\nfriendly witnesses, in that I did not get return phone calls from people I really wanted to get affidavits from, since I could\r\nnot require them [to] call me back or cooperate. \r\n\r\n\r\nCity's attorney responded:\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Honor, [Grant's attorney] - I don't think she meant to imply this, but I just want to present to the Court that we have\r\nbeen very cooperative in trying to reach a stipulation.  She talked about not [sic] able to reach people.  I do not believe\r\nthose people were city employees, and I do not believe she meant to imply that [City's attorney] or I somehow, you know,\r\ncaused the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrant's attorney replied:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is correct that I did not imply that they were not cooperative at all.  They have been, but, nonetheless, Your Honor, the\r\nrecord is still incomplete. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Grant reconstructed the record with an affidavit from his property manager.   \r\n\r\nThe record does not support the Court of Appeals' conclusion Grant was \"prohibited in obtaining affidavits\" and\r\n\"encountered a hostile environment\" in attempting to reconstruct the record.  The record indicates the circuit court gave\r\nGrant the opportunity to reconstruct the record from the Board hearing through stipulation, affidavits, or transcript. \r\nAlthough she initially suggested otherwise, Grant's counsel agreed City's employees were cooperative.  \r\n\r\nThe circuit court properly allowed Grant to reconstruct \r\n  the record. See Dolive v. J.E.E. Developers, Inc., 308 S.C. 380, \r\n  418 S.E.2d 319 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding trial court did not err in granting \r\n  property owner's request to reconstruct the record of zoning proceeding where \r\n  portions of original tape of hearing were incapable of being transcribed and \r\n  loss of vital portions of record appeared to have been through no fault of zoning \r\n  board); see also China v. Parrott, 251 S.C. 329, 162 S.E.2d \r\n  276 (1968) (where portions of stenographic notes of trial proceeding were lost \r\n  before being transcribed, not error for trial judge to consider affidavit of \r\n  trial counsel and court reporter in determining what transpired). Because Grant \r\n  failed to take advantage of the opportunity to reconstruct the record by obtaining \r\n  a stipulation with City's attorney, deposing witnesses, and/or filing his own \r\n  and his attorney's (8) affidavits, he is not \r\n  entitled to a new hearing. (9)  \r\n\r\nI would affirm in part and reverse in part the Court of Appeals' opinion.  \r\n1. City has consistently agreed Grant may use the lower level of his building for commercial purposes.  \r\n2. Section 6-7-760 has been repealed and recodified with similar language at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-830 (Supp. 2000).   \r\n3. Now recodified as S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-790 (Supp. 2000).\r\n4. In addition, Grant testified \r\n  a tenant added the kitchen in Unit B. Since Grant did not detrimentally change \r\n  his position based on the issuance of building permits for Unit B, he has failed \r\n  to meet the third element of estoppel as to this unit. See Midlands \r\n  Utility, Inc., v. South Carolina Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, supra \r\n  (in order to establish estoppel, party claiming estoppel must prejudicially \r\n  change position in reliance upon government conduct). \r\n5. The circuit court did not address Grant's vested right and waiver claims and these issues are not before us.\r\n6. Section 6-7-760 has been repealed and recodified with similar language at Â§ 6-29-830 (Supp. 2000).   \r\n7. Under my interpretation, zoning boards need not employ full-time court reporters.  \r\n8. A different attorney represented Grant on appeal.    \r\n9. Section 6-9-840 (Supp. 2000) \r\n  specifically provides that if the circuit court judge \"determines that the certified \r\n  record is insufficient for review, the matter may be remanded to the zoning \r\n  board of appeals for rehearing.\" This section became effective in May 1999. \r\n  See Act No. 355, 1994 S.C. Acts 4036. The predecessor to this section, \r\n  Â§ 6-7-780, did not have a provision for remand. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25318","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: We granted \r\n  certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals granting respondent \r\n  a new trial. The Court of Appeals held respondent was entitled to a new trial \r\n  because a seated juror failed to disclose that she had worked as a volunteer \r\n  victims' advocate in the prosecuting office. State v. Woods, 338 S.C. \r\n  561, 527 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 2000). We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn August of 1998 respondent was convicted of possession with intent to distribute (PWID) crack cocaine and PWID within\r\nproximity of a park.\r\n\r\nAfter the jury returned its verdict, but before the court imposed sentence, defense counsel moved for a new trial on the basis\r\nof after-discovered evidence.  The after-discovered evidence consisted of information, made known to respondent after the\r\ntrial, that a juror (\"Juror B\") had for three years worked as a volunteer victims' advocate in the solicitor's office which\r\nprosecuted the case.  The court held an evidentiary hearing to consider the motion.  At the hearing, Juror B testified that she\r\nhad worked as a volunteer victims' advocate in the solicitor's office \"off and on for about a good three years\" ending in\r\n1998.  Juror B added that her job did not entail significant interaction with the attorneys employed in the solicitor's office.\r\n\r\nThe trial court denied the motion for a new trial, \r\n  finding respondent had failed to show Juror B intentionally concealed information. \r\n  The court further found Juror B had not been biased in favor of the State. Respondent \r\n  appealed. The Court of Appeals, citing State v. Gulledge, 277 S.C. 368, \r\n  287 S.E.2d 488 (1982), reversed the trial court's denial of respondent's motion \r\n  for a new trial because \"the juror did not justify her failure to disclose\" \r\n  the information sought during voir dire. We granted the State's petition \r\n  for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision.\r\n\r\nDuring voir dire, the court asked potential jurors the following questions:\r\n\r\nQuestion 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you can tell me are you friends or casual acquaintances with any of them [i.e., the attorneys involved in the trial] or\r\nbusiness associates or social acquaintances with any of them, that would also include having been represented by any of\r\nthem in the past[?] [I]f so please stand. \r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, are any of you contributors to or supporters of any organization which has as its primary function the\r\npromotion of law enforcement or protection of victims' rights such as MADD, SADD, CAVE, or the like[?]  [I]f so please\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral jurors responded affirmatively to the questions above.  However, Juror B did not respond to either question.  Juror\r\nB was subsequently seated as a juror in the case.  When Juror B's name was drawn, respondent had one peremptory\r\nchallenge remaining.\r\n\r\nJuror B testified that she did not recall the judge asking Question 2, and that she would have responded had she heard the\r\nquestion.  She qualified her response by stating, \"it just didn't synchronize if I heard it, but I'm not doubting that it hadn't\r\nbeen said but it just didn't synchronize because I came into court with a clear mind.\"  She testified that she responded\r\naffirmatively to a similar question when asked on voir dire at a subsequent trial during the same term of court.\r\n\r\nJuror B gave conflicting testimony regarding Question 1.  Initially, she admitted hearing the question, but said she did not\r\nthink it applied to her.  She then said she could not recall the question being asked.  When respondent's attorney read the\r\nquestion from the transcript, she replied that the question \"didn't phase [sic] [her],\" implying that she heard the question,\r\nbut chose not to respond.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial court's denial of respondent's motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence?\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAll criminal defendants have the right to a trial \r\n  by an impartial jury. U.S. CONST. amends. VI and XIV; S.C. CONST. art. I, Â§ \r\n  14. To protect both parties' right to an impartial jury, the trial judge must \r\n  ask potential jurors whether they are aware of any bias or prejudice against \r\n  a party. State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998). \"Through \r\n  the judge, parties have a right to question jurors on their voir dire \r\n  examination not only for the purpose of showing grounds for a challenge for \r\n  cause, but also, within reasonable limits, to elicit such facts as will enable \r\n  them intelligently to exercise their right of peremptory challenge.\" Gulledge, \r\n  277 S.C. at 370, 287 S.E.2d at 490.\r\n\r\nWhen a juror conceals information inquired into \r\n  during voir dire, a new trial is required only when the court finds \r\n  the juror intentionally concealed the information, and that the information \r\n  concealed would have supported a challenge for cause or would have been a material \r\n  factor in the use of the party's peremptory challenges. Thompson v. O'Rourke, \r\n  288 S.C. 13, 15, 339 S.E.2d 505, 506 (1986). Where a juror, without justification, \r\n  fails to disclose a relationship, it may be inferred, nothing to the contrary \r\n  appearing, that the juror is not impartial. On the other hand, where the failure \r\n  to disclose is innocent, no such inference may be drawn. State v. Savage, \r\n  306 S.C. 5, 409 S.E.2d 809 (Ct. App. 1991). \r\n\r\nIn Kelly, we stated that the first inquiry \r\n  in the juror disqualification analysis is whether the juror intentionally concealed \r\n  the information during voir dire. Kelly, 331 S.C. at 146, 502 \r\n  S.E.2d at 106-07. However, in Kelly we did not precisely define what \r\n  constitutes an intentional concealment. \r\n\r\nWe hold that intentional concealment occurs when the question presented to the jury on voir dire is reasonably\r\ncomprehensible to the average juror and the subject of the inquiry is of such significance that the juror's failure to respond\r\nis unreasonable.  Unintentional concealment, on the other hand, occurs where the question posed is ambiguous or\r\nincomprehensible to the average juror, or where the subject of the inquiry is insignificant or so far removed in time that the\r\njuror's failure to respond is reasonable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, whether a juror's failure to respond is intentional is a fact intensive determination which must be made on a\r\ncase by case basis.\r\n\r\nOther jurisdictions have recognized similar distinctions between intentional and unintentional juror concealment.  For\r\nexample, the Missouri Supreme Court distinguished intentional from unintentional concealment as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\nIntentional nondisclosure occurs: 1) where there exists no reasonable inability to comprehend the information solicited by\r\nthe question asked of the prospective juror, and 2) where it develops that the prospective juror actually remembers the\r\nexperience or that it was of such significance that his purported forgetfulness is unreasonable. \r\n\r\nUnintentional nondisclosure exists where, for example, the experience forgotten was insignificant or remote in time, or\r\nwhere the venireman reasonably misunderstands the question posed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliams by and through Wilford v. Barnes Hosp., \r\n  736 S.W.2d 33, 36 (Mo. 1987). \r\n\r\nThe State argues that because respondent has not \r\n  shown that he was prejudiced by Juror B's responses, the Court of Appeals' decision \r\n  was erroneous. We disagree. The test pronounced in Thompson v. O'Rourke, \r\n  supra, makes clear that where a juror's response to voir dire \r\n  amounts to an intentional concealment, the movant need only show that the information \r\n  concealed would have supported a challenge for cause or would have been a material \r\n  factor in the use of the party's peremptory challenges. Where the juror's failure \r\n  to disclose information is \"without justification,\" i.e., intentional, the juror's \r\n  bias will be inferred. Conversely, where the failure to disclose is innocent, \r\n  no inference of bias can be drawn. See Savage, 306 S.C. at 8, \r\n  409 S.E.2d at 810. See also Doyle v. Kennedy Heating &amp; Service, \r\n  Inc., 33 S.W.3d 199, 201 (Mo. Ct. App. 2000) (\"If a juror intentionally \r\n  withholds material information requested on voir dire, bias and prejudice \r\n  are inferred from such concealment. . . . Only where a juror's intentional nondisclosure \r\n  does not involve a material issue, or where the nondisclosure is unintentional, \r\n  should the trial court inquire into prejudice.\" (Emphasis in original)).\r\n\r\nApplying this analysis to the instant case, we find the concealment was intentional.  Questions 1 and 2 were reasonably\r\ncomprehensible and should have elicited a positive response from Juror B.  Juror B worked as a volunteer victims'\r\nadvocate for a period of three years in the solicitor's office which prosecuted the case.  There is no question she\r\nremembered the experience.\r\n\r\nQuestion 1 unambiguously sought a response from any juror having a business association with any of the attorneys trying\r\nthe case.  Despite her prior three year relationship with the prosecuting attorney's office, Juror B did not respond.  Her\r\ncontention that she did not hear the question when asked, or that if she heard the question, she did not realize it applied to\r\nher, cannot excuse her failure to respond. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, her failure to respond in the affirmative to Question 2 amounted to an intentional concealment.  Juror B had for\r\nthree years performed volunteer work for an organization whose primary function was the protection of victims' rights. \r\nShe offered inconsistent explanations for her failure to respond, alternately contending that she did not hear the question\r\nand that she failed to comprehend its application to her position as victims' advocate.  The question was reasonably\r\ncomprehensible.  Its application to Juror B was clear.  This finding is further supported by the fact that Juror B responded\r\naffirmatively to a similar question on voir dire at a later trial during the same term of court.\r\n\r\nHaving found that Juror B intentionally concealed \r\n  information on voir dire, we must determine if the information concealed \r\n  would have supported a challenge for cause or would have been a material factor \r\n  in the use of respondent's peremptory challenges. See Thompson v. \r\n  O'Rourke, supra. A juror should be disqualified by the court if it \r\n  appears to the court the juror is not indifferent in the case. The decision \r\n  to strike a juror for cause is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. \r\n  Abofreka v. Alston Tobacco Co., 288 S.C. 122, 341 S.E.2d 622 (1986).\r\n\r\nBecause Juror B did not respond to any of the questions asked during voir dire, any potential biases she might have had\r\ntoward the State were not discovered until after the trial.  No motion to disqualify Juror B was made, thus there is no\r\ndiscretionary ruling by the trial judge for this Court to review.  However, we need not decide whether her relationship with\r\nthe solicitor's office would support a challenge for cause because we find her failure to disclose the relationship prevented\r\nthe respondent's intelligent exercise of his peremptory challenges.\r\n\r\nWhen Juror B's name was selected from the venire, respondent had one peremptory challenge remaining.  Respondent's\r\ntrial counsel stated that had he known of Juror B's relationship with the solicitor's office, he would have used a peremptory\r\nchallenge to remove her from the jury.  Nothing in the record refutes this assertion.  It is reasonable to conclude that a\r\njuror's previous three year relationship as a victims' advocate with the prosecuting solicitor's office would be a material\r\nfactor in the use of a criminal defendant's peremptory challenges.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBecause Juror B failed to respond to questions on voir dire which clearly applied to her, and because her concealment\r\ndeprived respondent of information material to his intelligent use of peremptory challenges, we AFFIRM the decision of\r\nthe Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, J., and Acting Justice George T. Gregory, Jr., concur.  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  I respectfully \r\n  dissent. While Juror B did not respond to two voir dire questions, \r\n  the record does not support the majority's conclusion that she intentionally \r\n  concealed information from the parties. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals granting respondent a new trial. State v. Woods, \r\n  338 S.C. 561, 527 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\n\r\nDuring voir dire, the trial judge asked the following question (Question 1):  \r\n\r\n\r\nNow can you tell me are you friends or casual acquaintances with any of them [i.e., the attorneys involved in the trial] or\r\nbusiness associates of social acquaintances with any of them . . .? \r\n\r\n\r\nNo juror responded.   \r\n\r\nThe trial judge later inquired (Question 2):  \r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, are any of you contributors to or supporters of any organization which has as its primary function the\r\npromotion of law enforcement or protection of victim's rights such as MADD, SADD, CAVE, or the like. . .?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the new trial hearing, the trial judge informed Juror B the parties were interested in her participation as a victim\r\nadvocate with the Solicitor's Office.  Juror B stated she had volunteered as a victim advocate with the Solicitor's Office. \r\nWhen defense counsel referred generally to the voir dire, Juror B stated: \"I may have misunderstood or didn't hear [the trial\r\njudge] but he didn't mention anything about an advocate that I heard.  You know, being an advocate you're not eligible and\r\nso forth, not for this particular trial.\"  \r\n\r\n    Defense counsel then questioned Juror B specifically about her responses to the voir dire questions.  At first, Juror B\r\nagreed she heard the trial judge ask Question 1, but did not believe it applied to her as a victim's advocate.  Thereafter, she\r\nstated she did not recall Question 1 being asked.  Finally, after defense counsel showed her the transcript from the voir dire,\r\nJuror B stated:\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.  Well see, that wouldn't, that didn't phase [sic] me.  I was under the impression that you were talking about, you\r\nknow, the victim or you all because I don't have anything to do with.  Like I never spoken to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding whether she recalled the trial judge asking Question 2, Juror B responded:\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, if I had I would have stepped up.  I heard some things on the second time that they called me to be a juror and then I\r\nstood up. . .   I don't know.  It just didn't synchronize if I heard it, but I'm not doubting that it hadn't been said but it just\r\ndidn't synchronize because I came into court with a clear mind.  And I have no problems.  I cannot associate one thing with\r\nanother.  And I had no association with that at all.      \r\n\r\n\r\nFinding Juror B did not intentionally refuse to respond to the voir dire questions, the trial judge denied respondent's motion\r\nfor a new trial.   \r\n\r\nA trial judge's denial of a new trial motion will \r\n  not be disturbed on review absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Kelly, \r\n  331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998). Where a juror fails to respond to voir \r\n  dire questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n[A new trial] is required only when the court finds the [intentionally] concealed information would have supported a\r\nchallenge for cause or would have been a material factor in the use of the party's peremptory challenges.  The inquiry must\r\nfocus on the character of the concealed information, not on the mere fact that a concealment occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 146, S.E.2d at 106 (brackets in original) \r\n  quoting Thompson v. O'Rourke, 288 S.C. 13, 15, 339 S.E.2d 505, \r\n  506 (1986). \r\n\r\nThe question before the Court is whether Juror \r\n  B intentionally concealed the fact that she had volunteered as a victim advocate \r\n  with the Solicitor's Office. Juror B's responses to defense counsel's inquiries \r\n  do not suggest that she intentionally refused to inform the parties about her \r\n  victim advocate experience. Juror B's response that Question 1 \"didn't phase \r\n  [sic] her\" did not necessarily imply, as the majority assumes, that she intentionally \r\n  chose to conceal information. Her response just as easily implies that she did \r\n  not believe an affirmative response was required because, although she had worked \r\n  in conjunction with the Solicitor's Office, she did not know the prosecutor \r\n  involved with the trial. Juror B had justification for not responding to the \r\n  question. Compare State v. Savage, 306 S.C. 5, 409 S.E.2d 809 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1991) (trial judge did not err by refusing to grant mistrial where \r\n  juror refused to disclose relationship as result of an honest mistake) with \r\n  State v. Gulledge, 277 S.C. 368, 287 S.E.2d 488 (1982) (trial judge should \r\n  have granted mistrial where juror failed to provide any justification for failing \r\n  to disclose relationship with witness). Further, as she acknowledged, Juror \r\n  B's failure to respond to Question 2 was due to her inattentiveness, not to \r\n  an intentional refusal to respond to the inquiry. State v. Savage, supra. \r\n\r\n\r\nI concur with the majority's assertion that whether \r\n  a juror's failure to respond to a particular voir dire question \r\n  is \"a fact intensive determination which must be made on a case by case basis.\" \r\n  Where a decision rests on a \"fact intensive determination,\" the Court should \r\n  defer to the trial judge's assessment of the juror's credibility. State v. \r\n  Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 530 S.E.2d 626 (2000) (trial judge is in the best position \r\n  to determine the credibility of the jurors). Here, the trial judge had the opportunity \r\n  to assess Juror B's candor and he determined she did not intentionally conceal \r\n  information from the parties. I would affirm the trial judge's refusal to grant \r\n  a new trial. State v. Loftis, 232 S.C. 35, 100 S.E.2d 671 (1957) (refusing \r\n  to interfere with the discretion of a trial judge in matters involving the jury \r\n  because trial judge has opportunity to consider credibility of jurors). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25319","title":"Curtis v.

Curtis (\"Curtis\") appeals the trial court's denial of a temporary injunction concerning the enforcement of S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 16-13-470 (Supp. 2000), which prohibits the selling of urine with the intent to defraud a drug screening test.  We affirm. \r\n\r\nFacts/Procedural History\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Curtis started an internet business known as Privacy \r\n  Protection Services. (1) Through this business, \r\n  Curtis sells his own urine, which is certified as drug and adulterant free, \r\n  along with a \"urine test substitution kit.\" Each urine test substitution kit \r\n  comes with Curtis' urine, a pouch, a tube, and a chemical hand warmer device. \r\n  Because proper temperature is critical for acceptance at any urine testing site, \r\n  each kit comes with \"chemically reactive supplemental heat sources\" and a temperature \r\n  monitoring system that insures proper acceptance temperature. Furthermore, the \r\n  kit can be easily concealed on the body and can be used in a natural urinating \r\n  position, which means it cannot be detected even if directly observed. \r\n  (2) According to Privacy Protection Services' website: \"Our complete \r\n  urine test substitution kits allow anyone, regardless of substance intake, to \r\n  pass any urinalysis within minutes.\" (3)\r\n\r\nBased on his website and his June 17, 1999, affidavit, Curtis \r\n  maintains his primary objection to urine testing by employers is they do not \r\n  merely test for drugs, they also test for pregnancy, diabetes, cigarette smoking, \r\n  hypertension, and other diseases or genetic traits. He believes this type of \r\n  testing by employers constitutes an infringement on the privacy rights of prospective \r\n  employees and leads to access of private information.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 1999, the Governor of South Carolina signed \r\n  Senate Bill 277, which amended S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-470 \"to provide that selling \r\n  urine with the intent to defraud a drug screening is a felony.\" Under section \r\n  16-13-470, the penalty for the first offense is a fine of not more than five \r\n  thousand dollars and imprisonment of not more than three years, or both. The \r\n  penalty for a second or subsequent offense is a fine of not more than ten thousand \r\n  dollars or imprisonment of not more than five years, or both. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-13-470 (Supp. 2000). Pursuant to the statute, intent is presumed if a heating \r\n  element or any other device used to thwart a drug-screening test accompanies \r\n  the sale. Id. \r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1999, Curtis filed a Motion for an Ex Parte \r\n  Temporary Restraining Order and a Motion for a Temporary Injunction. The trial \r\n  judge granted the Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order on June 18, \r\n  1999. On June 30, 1999, the trial court denied the Motion for a Temporary Injunction \r\n  and issued a formal Order. Curtis' Motion for Reconsideration was denied and \r\n  this appeal followed. \r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2000, the Attorney General filed a Motion \r\n  to Dismiss Appeal as Moot and a Motion to Supplement Record on Appeal with Memorandum \r\n  in Support Thereof. On August 18, 2000, the trial judge entered an order ruling \r\n  on the merits of this case, holding section 16-13-470 constitutional and a legitimate \r\n  exercise of the State's police powers. The Attorney General moves this Court \r\n  to dismiss the appeal of the denial of a temporary injunction because the appeal \r\n  is moot. According to the Attorney General's Motion, any order issued by this \r\n  Court will be advisory and will have no practical effect on an existing controversy. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following issues are before \r\n  this Court on appeal:\r\n\r\n I.&nbsp; Since the trial court has issued an order \r\n  on the merits of this case, should this Court dismiss the appeal of the denial \r\n  of a temporary injunction because the trial court's order renders the appeal \r\n  moot?  \r\n  II.&nbsp; Did the trial court err by holding Curtis is \r\n    not entitled to a temporary injunction against the enforcement of section \r\n    16-13-470 when Curtis failed to establish that he will suffer irreparable \r\n    harm or that he has no adequate remedy at law? \r\n  III.&nbsp; Did the trial court \r\n    err in holding Curtis is not likely to succeed on the merits? \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp; Does section 16-13-470 create an impermissible \r\n      presumption of guilt?\r\n    B.&nbsp; Is section 16-13-470 vague, overly broad, and \r\n    ambiguous? \r\n    C.&nbsp; What legitimate public purpose does section \r\n      16-13-470 protect? \r\n    D.&nbsp; Does section 16-13-470 infringe upon First \r\n      Amendment rights? \r\n    E.&nbsp; Does section 16-13-470 violate equal protection? \r\n    F.&nbsp; Does section 16-13-470 constitute cruel and \r\n      unusual punishment? \r\n    G.&nbsp; Does section 16-13-470 impermissibly interfere \r\n      with interstate commerce? \r\n    H.&nbsp; Does section 16-13-470 \r\n      abridge the right to privacy? \r\n    I.&nbsp; Does section 16-13-470 violate the Fourth Amendment? \r\n  \r\n  IV.&nbsp; Did the trial court err \r\n  in reaching the merits on a motion for temporary relief? \r\n\r\n\r\n    Law/Analysis  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Mootness \r\nThe Attorney General argues the appeal in this case is moot \r\n  and any order issued by this Court will be advisory because the trial court \r\n  has issued an order on the merits.  \r\n  (4) \r\n\r\nAn appellate court will not pass on moot and academic questions \r\n  or make an adjudication where there remains no actual controversy. Jackson \r\n  v. State, 331 S.C. 486, 489 S.E.2d 915 (1997). Moot appeals differ from \r\n  unripe appeals in that moot appeals result when intervening events render a \r\n  case nonjusticiable. See Jean Hoefer Toal, Shahin Vafai &amp; Robert \r\n  A. Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina 122 (1999). \"A \r\n  case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect \r\n  upon [the] existing controversy. This is true when some event occurs making \r\n  it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.\" Mathis \r\n  v. South Carolina State Highway Dep't, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, \r\n  715 (1973).\r\n\r\nIn the civil context, there are three general exceptions \r\n  to the mootness doctrine. First, an appellate court can take jurisdiction, despite \r\n  mootness, if the issue raised is capable of repetition but evading review. See \r\n  generally Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996); \r\n  Citizen Awareness Regarding Educ. v. Calhoun County Publ'g, Inc., 406 \r\n  S.E.2d 65 (W. Va. Ct. App. 1991) (holding an appellate court could consider \r\n  newspaper's appeal from trial court's injunction compelling newspaper to publish \r\n  political action advertisement even though case was moot because issue was capable \r\n  of repetition yet evaded review). Second, an appellate court may decide questions \r\n  of imperative and manifest urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in \r\n  matters of important public interest. See generally Berry v. Zahler, \r\n  220 S.C. 86, 66 S.E.2d 459 (1951) (the court recognized that questions of public \r\n  interest originally encompassed in an action should be decided for future guidance \r\n  however abstract or moot they may have become in the immediate contest). Finally, \r\n  if a decision by the trial court may affect future events, or have collateral \r\n  consequences for the parties, an appeal from that decision is not moot, even \r\n  though the appellate court cannot give effective relief in the present case. \r\n  See 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate Review Â§ 649 (1995). \r\n\r\nAn order or decree in a court of common pleas granting, \r\n  continuing, modifying, or refusing an injunction is immediately appealable. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(4) (Supp. 2000); Appeal of Paslay, 230 S.C. \r\n  55, 94 S.E.2d 57 (1956) (appeal lay from the restraining order or temporary \r\n  injunction). However, \"[t]he rule that an appellate court limits its review \r\n  to the issues necessary to a proper disposition of the appeal, and will not \r\n  consider immaterial or moot questions, applies when reviewing decrees and orders \r\n  relating to injunctions.\" 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions Â§ 335 (2000). \r\n  Where only injunctive relief is sought and the need for that relief has ceased \r\n  to be a justiciable issue, an appellate court should not review the merits, \r\n  or consider the granting of a new trial after it has become impossible to have \r\n  a new trial in the case. See generally State ex rel. Matthews v. Eastin, \r\n  297 P.2d 170 (Kan. 1956).\r\n\r\nTexas courts have held an appeal of a temporary injunction \r\n  is moot where a trial court renders final judgment while the appeal is pending. \r\n  See Lowe v. Farm Credit Bank of Texas, 2 S.W.3d 293 (Tex. Ct. App. \r\n  1999); Save Our Springs Alliance v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 973 S.W.2d \r\n  378 (Tex. Ct. App. 1998) (trial court's final judgment rendered the appeal of \r\n  the temporary injunction moot). According to Texas case law, dismissing an appeal \r\n  from a temporary injunction after it has been rendered moot by final judgment \r\n  is necessary to prevent premature review of the merits of the case. Isuani \r\n  v. Manske-Sheffield Radiology Group, P.A., 802 S.W.2d 235 (Tex. \r\n  1991). \r\n\r\nThe trial judge's June 30, 1999, Order renders this case \r\n  nonjusticiable because any decision by this Court will not have a practical \r\n  legal effect on the temporary injunction. The sole object of a temporary injunction \r\n  is to preserve the subject of the controversy in its condition at the time of \r\n  the order until opportunity is offered for full and deliberate trial investigation. \r\n  Epps v. Bryant, 218 S.C. 359, 62 S.E.2d 832 (1950). Temporary injunctions \r\n  are interlocutory, tentative, and impermanent and are superseded by the final \r\n  judgment rendered on the merits. 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions Â§ 294 (2000). \r\n  Thus, temporary injunctions \"remain in force only until, and expire upon, the \r\n  entry of the final judgment and are not enforceable after the final judgment \r\n  has been entered.\" Id. \r\n\r\nCurtis has received a full investigation of his claim because \r\n  the trial court has rendered a decision on the merits of this case. Therefore, \r\n  the temporary injunction has expired and the issue is moot. However, we signed \r\n  an Order taking the appeal on its merits from the Court of Appeals. We consolidated \r\n  the merits appeal with the temporary injunction appeal. For the sake of judicial \r\n  economy, we address the merits. \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Success on the Merits\r\n\r\nThis Court has a limited scope of review in cases involving \r\n  a constitutional challenge to a statute because all statutes are presumed constitutional \r\n  and, if possible, will be construed to render them valid. Davis v. County \r\n  of Greenville, 322 S.C. 73, 470 S.E.2d 94 (1996). \"A possible constitutional \r\n  construction must prevail over an unconstitutional interpretation.\" Westvaco \r\n  Corp. v. South Carolina Dep't of Revenue, 321 S.C. 59, 467 S.E.2d 739 (1995). \r\n  Further, a legislative act will not be declared unconstitutional unless its \r\n  repugnance to the Constitution is clear and beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. \r\n  Because Curtis does not establish an infringement of a constitutional right, \r\n  the trial court was correct in holding he is not likely to succeed on the merits \r\n  of the following constitutional challenges. \r\n\r\nA.&nbsp; Impermissible Presumption of Guilt  \r\nCurtis argues section 16-13-470 unconstitutionally shifts \r\n  the burden of proof on the issue of criminal intent to the defendant. We agree. \r\n  Specifically, section 16-13-470 states, \"[i]ntent is presumed if a heating element \r\n  or any other device used to thwart a drug-screening test accompanies the sale, \r\n  giving, distribution, or marketing of urine or if instructions which provide \r\n  a method for thwarting a drug-screening test accompany the sale, giving, distribution, \r\n  or marketing of urine.\" \r\n\r\nSection 16-13-470 unconstitutionally shifts the burden of \r\n  proof to the criminal defendant because it states that \"intent is presumed\" \r\n  when certain conditions are met. This language violates the United States Supreme \r\n  Court's holding in Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, \r\n  61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979) because it acts as a conclusive presumption. \r\n  In Sandstrom, the United States Supreme Court held the defendant's \r\n  due process rights were violated by a jury instruction on the issue of intent \r\n  where the trial judge instructed, \"the law presumes that a person intends the \r\n  ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\" According to the Supreme Court, \r\n  the jury in Sandstrom may have interpreted the trial judge's instruction \r\n  as a burden shifting presumption or a conclusive presumption. This jury instruction \r\n  violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment's due process requirement that the \r\n  State prove every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In finding such \r\n  a presumptive instruction unconstitutional, the Supreme Court found where intent \r\n  is an element of the crime charged, it follows that the trial court may not \r\n  withdraw or prejudge the issue by instructing the jury the law raises a presumption \r\n  of intent from an act. Sandstrom, supra. This invades the fact finding \r\n  responsibility of the jury.\r\n\r\nA statute may be constitutional and valid in part and unconstitutional \r\n  and invalid in part. Thayer v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 307 S.C. \r\n  6, 413 S.E.2d 810 (1992). We find the unconstitutional intent language is severable \r\n  from the remainder of section 16-13-470. The test for severability is whether \r\n  the constitutional portion of the statute remains complete in itself, wholly \r\n  independent of that which is rejected, and is of such a character that it may \r\n  fairly be presumed the legislature would have passed it independent of that \r\n  which conflicts with the constitution. Joytime Distribs. &amp; Amusement \r\n  Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 648-649, 528 S.E.2d 647, 654 (1999) (citations \r\n  omitted). \"When the residue of an Act, sans that portion found to be unconstitutional, \r\n  is capable of being executed in accordance with the Legislative intent, independent \r\n  of the rejected portion, the Act as a whole should not be stricken as being \r\n  in violation of a Constitutional Provision.\" Id. (quoting Dean \r\n  v. Timmerman, 234 S.C. 35, 43, 106 S.E.2d 665, 669 (1959)). \r\n\r\nWe find the unconstitutional intent language is severable \r\n  from the remainder of section 16-13-470. The remainder of the statute outlines \r\n  the different unlawful ways a person can attempt to defraud a drug and alcohol \r\n  screening test, using general language to describe intent. The remainder of \r\n  the statute is complete without the intent presumption language because it allows \r\n  the jury to infer intent from the circumstantial evidence presented at trial. \r\n  We presume the legislature would have passed section 16-13-470 regardless of \r\n  whether the presumption language was included. We, therefore, sever the unconstitutional \r\n  presumption language from the rest of the statute. \r\n\r\nB.&nbsp; Unconstitutionally Vague and Overbroad \r\nCurtis argues section 16-13-470 is unconstitutionally vague \r\n  and overbroad. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the \r\n  constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair notice and \r\n  proper standards for adjudication.\" City of Beaufort v. Baker, 315 \r\n  S.C. 146, 152, 432 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1993). The constitutional standard for vagueness \r\n  is the practical criterion of fair notice to those to whom the law applies. \r\n  Huber v. South Carolina State Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 316 S.C. \r\n  24, 446 S.E.2d 433 (1994). A law is unconstitutionally vague if it forbids or \r\n  requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that a person of common intelligence \r\n  must necessarily guess as to its meaning and differ as to its application. Toussaint \r\n  v. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 303 S.C. 316, 400 S.E.2d 488 (1991). One \r\n  to whose conduct the law clearly applies does not have standing to challenge \r\n  it for vagueness. Id.  \r\n\r\nAlthough some of the terms in section 16-13-470 are undefined, \r\n  the intent of the statute is clear on its face. The statute makes it unlawful \r\n  to \"sell, give away, distribute, or market urine . . . with the intent to defraud \r\n  a drug or alcohol screening test.\" A person of ordinary intelligence seeking \r\n  to obey the law will know, and is sufficiently warned of, the conduct the statute \r\n  makes criminal. Curtis argues that section 16-13-470 is unconstitutionally vague \r\n  because terms such as \"foil,\" \"spike,\" \"defraud,\" \"bodily fluids,\" and \"adulterate\" \r\n  are not defined. However, all of these terms have common, ordinary meanings \r\n  sufficient to proscribe conduct, and do not need to be specifically defined. \r\n  See State v. Hamilton, 276 S.C. 173, 276 S.E.2d 784 (1981) (the fact \r\n  that \"force or coercion\" was undefined by the statute did not render the statute \r\n  vague or ambiguous because the words are of common, ordinary meaning and are \r\n  sufficiently specific to proscribe the conduct). Further, all the Constitution \r\n  requires is that the language convey sufficiently definite warnings as to the \r\n  proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. See \r\n  State v. Solomon, 245 S.C. 550, 141 S.E.2d 818 (1965).\r\n\r\nC.&nbsp; Legitimate Public Purpose \r\nCurtis argues section 16-13-470 serves no legitimate public \r\n  purpose. He argues there is no legitimate public purpose in helping \"private \r\n  industry do urine testing that doesn't even reflect accurately on their consumption \r\n  of substances and which has no relation to impairment of safety.\" Curtis also \r\n  argues the Attorney General fails to submit affidavits demonstrating how section \r\n  16-13-470 will serve to lessen drug use in the workplace or in any way promote \r\n  the safety, health, or welfare of the citizens of South Carolina. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n\r\n As noted in the trial court's Order, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court has held drug testing of employees through urinalysis is lawful \r\n  and constitutional. See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, \r\n  489 U.S. 602, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 103 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1989) (testing railway employees \r\n  for drugs and alcohol after a serious accident was constitutional). The General \r\n  Assembly has passed several statutes that permit random drug testing to further \r\n  the public policy of a drug-free work environment. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 38-73-500 (Supp. 2000) (provides a workers' compensation credit for random \r\n  drug testing to provide incentive for employers to prevent drug use and work-related \r\n  accidents); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-1-15 (Supp. 2000) (authorizing an establishment \r\n  of drug prevention program in the workplace which includes a substance abuse \r\n  testing program). \r\n\r\nA statute making it unlawful to defraud a drug test furthers \r\n  the public purpose of ensuring a drug-free workplace. Section 16-13-470 is a \r\n  legitimate exercise of the State's police powers in regulating public safety \r\n  and welfare. Furthermore, the public purpose of creating safety in the workplace \r\n  outweighs any legitimate interest, if any, of Curtis in doing business. \r\n\r\nD.&nbsp; First Amendment Rights  \r\nCurtis argues section 16-13-470 violates his right to free \r\n  speech because it directly prohibits the expression of ideas relative to urine \r\n  testing. We disagree. \r\n\r\nAlong with his urine, Curtis provides literature with instructions \r\n  on how to defeat a drug test and literature regarding his political beliefs \r\n  on drug testing. Section 16-13-470 does not prohibit Curtis from dispensing \r\n  literature regarding his political beliefs on urine testing. Furthermore, we \r\n  sever the provision from section 16-13-470 which states that intent will be \r\n  presumed if \"instructions which provide a method for thwarting a drug-screening \r\n  test\" accompanies the sale of his urine. We find the remaining statute does \r\n  not infringe on Curtis' right to free speech. \r\n\r\n\r\nE. Equal Protection\r\n\r\n\r\nCurtis argues section 16-13-470 violates the Equal Protection \r\n  Clause because it differentiates urine sales from the sale of herbal supplements \r\n  and other products sold to mask drugs in one's urine. (5) \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Protection Clause provides: \"No State shall . \r\n  . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" \r\n  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1. A classification does not violate the Equal Protection \r\n  Clause if: (1) the classification bears a reasonable relation to the legislative \r\n  purpose sought to be effected; (2) the members of the class are treated alike \r\n  under similar circumstances and conditions; and (3) the classification rests \r\n  on some reasonable basis. Whaley v. Dorchester County Zoning Bd. of Appeals, \r\n  337 S.C. 568, 524 S.E.2d 404 (1999). The determination of whether a classification \r\n  is reasonable is initially one for the legislative body and will be sustained \r\n  if it is not plainly arbitrary and there is a reasonable hypothesis to support \r\n  it. Id. \"The fact that the classification may result in some inequity \r\n  does not render it unconstitutional.\" Id. (citing Davis v. County \r\n  of Greenville, 313 S.C. 459, 465, 443 S.E.2d 383, 386 (1994)).\r\n\r\nThis case does not involve a suspect classification or a \r\n  fundamental right, so the question under equal protection analysis is whether \r\n  the legislation is rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. Casbah, \r\n  Inc., v. Thone, 651 F.2d 551 (8th Cir. 1981) (citing Massachusetts \r\n  Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 96 S. Ct. 2562, 49 L. Ed. 2d 520 (1976)). \r\n  We find the classification of an individual who sells urine or an adulterant \r\n  to defeat a drug test is rationally related to the legitimate state purpose \r\n  of promoting a safe work environment. First, the classification is reasonably \r\n  related to the legislative purpose of insuring the safety of the workplace through \r\n  the protection of drug testing programs. Second, all people who constitute the \r\n  class are treated similarly. The classification rests on a reasonable basis \r\n  and includes any person who sells a product intended to adulterate urine or \r\n  other bodily fluid sample for the purposes of defrauding a drug or alcohol screening \r\n  test. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-470(A)(5). Curtis' equal protection claims fails \r\n  because all individuals who engage in conduct prohibited by section 16-3-470 \r\n  are treated alike, regardless of whether they adulterate urine samples with \r\n  herbal supplements or chemicals. \r\n\r\nF.&nbsp; Cruel and Unusual Punishment \r\nCurtis argues the sentence proscribed by section 16-13-470 \r\n  constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment \r\n  because the sentence is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Amendment only prohibits sentences which are \r\n  grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. Yeargin v. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 313 S.C. 387, 438 S.E.2d \r\n  234 (1993) (citations omitted). Pursuant to section 16-13-470, the punishment \r\n  for a first offense misdemeanor conviction is a fine not more than five thousand \r\n  dollars or imprisonment of not more than three years, or both. A second, or \r\n  subsequent, conviction is a felony punishable by a fine not more than ten thousand \r\n  dollars or imprisonment not more than three years, or both. This punishment \r\n  is not inhumane or disproportionate to the severity of the crime. The trial \r\n  court has discretion as to the amount of the fine or length of imprisonment. \r\n  Moreover, section 16-13-470 does not preclude the sentencing authority from \r\n  considering mitigating and aggravating circumstances in fashioning an appropriate \r\n  sentence. \r\n\r\nG.&nbsp; Interstate Commerce \r\nCurtis argues section 16-13-470 prohibits the flow of interstate \r\n  goods and impermissibly burdens interstate commerce. We disagree.\r\n\r\nFirst, this case does not involve the commerce clause, it \r\n  involves the legislature's exercise of its police powers to prohibit commerce \r\n  that is intended to defraud South Carolina employers and create an unsafe work \r\n  environment. Furthermore, section 16-13-470 does not unduly burden interstate \r\n  commerce because it does not ban the sale of urine and other bodily fluids. \r\n  It simply makes it unlawful for someone to sell, give away, distribute, or market \r\n  urine with the intent to use the urine to defraud a drug or alcohol \r\n  screening test. \r\n\r\nH.&nbsp; Right to Privacy \r\nCurtis argues he has a constitutional right to sell his \r\n  urine. He also argues that South Carolina has placed itself in the unlawful \r\n  position of monitoring urine testing. We disagree. \r\n\r\nFirst, section 16-13-470 does not involve an act of surveillance \r\n  by the State, it involves the commercialization of urine to defraud drug tests. \r\n  Second, Curtis does not have standing to assert section 16-13-470 unconstitutionally \r\n  invades the privacy rights of those who are subject to urine testing. See \r\n  Stone v. Salley, 244 S.C. 531, 537, 137 S.E.2d 788, 790 (1964) overruled \r\n  on other grounds by R.L. Jordan Co. v. Boardman Petroleum, Inc., 338 S.C. \r\n  475, 527 S.E.2d 763 (2000) (holding a plaintiff \"cannot obtain a decision as \r\n  to the invalidity of [an] Act on the ground that it impairs the rights of others.\"). \r\n  Finally, the statute does not prohibit Curtis from doing what he wants with \r\n  his urine. He could even sell his urine for other purposes as long as he does \r\n  not intend to defraud a drug or alcohol screening test. \r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Fourth Amendment  \r\nCurtis argues section 16-13-470 violates the Fourth Amendment. \r\n  We disagree. In essence, Curtis attempts to assert the Fourth Amendment rights \r\n  of his customers against drug testing in the workplace. First, Curtis does not \r\n  have standing to assert the constitutional rights of his customers. See \r\n  Stone, supra. Second, section 16-13-470 does not mandate drug \r\n  testing, it simply makes it a crime to sell urine or other adulterants with \r\n  the intent to defraud a drug test. \r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; The Merits \r\nCurtis argues the trial court erred in reaching the merits \r\n  on his Motion for Temporary Relief. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a temporary injunction should issue, \r\n  the trial judge should not consider the merits of the case, except as they may \r\n  enable the trial court to determine whether a prima facie showing has been made. \r\n  Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 167 S.E.2d 313 \r\n  (1969). When a prima facie showing has been made entitling the plaintiff to \r\n  injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be granted without regard to \r\n  the ultimate termination of the case on the merits. Id. However, when \r\n  a plaintiff's prima facie case depends on an allegation that a statute in unconstitutional, \r\n  the trial judge must consider the matter in determining the reasonable necessity \r\n  for a temporary injunction. Hutchison v. York County, 86 S.C. 396, \r\n  68 S.E. 577 (1910). In order to reverse the refusal of a temporary injunction \r\n  in such a case, this Court must review the constitutional question. Id. \r\n   \r\n\r\nA trial court may consider a case's merit to the extent \r\n  necessary to determine whether a temporary injunction should issue. Roberts \r\n  v. Union County Bd. of Sch. Trs., 284 S.C. 299, 326 S.E.2d 163 (Ct. App. \r\n  1985). The trial court in this case found Curtis was not likely to succeed on \r\n  the merits because he had not established a valid infringement upon a fundamental \r\n  constitutional right. Although the trial judge ruled on the merits of Curtis' \r\n  constitutional arguments, it was necessary to determine the likelihood of success \r\n  on the merits. Furthermore, according to Hutchison, supra, it was proper \r\n  for the trial judge to consider the merits because Curtis' prima facie case \r\n  depended on an allegation that section 16-13-470 was unconstitutional. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe sever the unconstitutional presumption language from \r\n  section 16-13-470, affirm the trial court's order upholding the constitutionality \r\n  of the remainder of section 16-13-470, and find section 16-13-470 is a valid \r\n  exercise of the State's police powers.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring \r\n  in result only. \r\n1.  Privacy \r\n  Protection Services can be found at www.privacypro.com. \r\n2.  According \r\n  to the website, each kit contains a small reservoir pouch (about the size of \r\n  a pack of cigarettes) that has a small diameter tube that can be routed to the \r\n  genital area. The tube has a flow/stop clip that makes dispensing easy and natural. \r\n  The kit can be stored indefinitely or kept on hand in case of random testing. \r\n  These complete kits provide everything needed for two urine testing procedures. \r\n3.  In Curtis' \r\n  Brief he maintains \"he does not tout the product as a means to avoid detection \r\n  of drug or alcohol abuse.\" However, the website describes how one can conceal \r\n  the kit in any drug test. The website also includes a cartoon depicting a man \r\n  urinating on a law enforcement officer. The cartoon is accompanied by the following \r\n  quotation: \"South Carolina law makers are pinching the weenie but can't stop \r\n  the flow!\" \r\n4.  We granted \r\n  the Attorney General's motion to supplement the Record on Appeal with the trial \r\n  judge's order on the merits. \r\n5.  For example, \r\n  Curtis argues the sale of water is not prohibited even thought it is the primary \r\n  adulterant used to defeat urine tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25320","title":"Osborne v.

After Connor developed \r\n  serious physical and mental ailments, Osborne brought suit alleging negligence \r\n  on the part of the above-captioned defendants. The trial court granted McLeod's \r\n  motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals, relying in large part on \r\n  its decision in Simmons v. Tuomey Regional Medical Center, 330 S.C. 115, \r\n  498 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1998) (hereinafter, \"Simmons I\"), affirmed. \r\n  Osborne v. Adams, 338 S.C. 82, 525 S.E.2d 268 (Ct. App. 1999). We granted \r\n  certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision, in light of our modification \r\n  of Simmons I. See Simmons v. Tuomey Regional Medical Center, \r\n  341 S.C. 32, 533 S.E.2d 312 (2000) (\"Simmons II\"). We reverse.\r\n\r\nISSUE I \r\n\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in granting McLeod's motion for summary judgment?\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when \"there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \r\n  of law.\" Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 \r\n  S.E.2d 537 (1991).\r\n\r\nIn determining whether any triable issues of fact \r\n  exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Summer v. Carpenter, \r\n  328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997). On appeal from an order granting summary \r\n  judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and \r\n  inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the \r\n  non-moving party below. Williams v. Chesterfield Lumber Co., 267 S.C. \r\n  607, 230 S.E.2d 447 (1976).\r\n\r\nBased on its holding in Simmons I that a \r\n  hospital's nondelegable duties are confined to emergency room care, the Court \r\n  of Appeals affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of \r\n  McLeod. The Court of Appeals expressed its opinion that Section 429 of the Restatement \r\n  (Second) of Torts was not an accurate reflection of the law of this State, and \r\n  therefore, Osborne could not rely on that section in maintaining a cause of \r\n  action against McLeod. \r\n\r\nHowever, in Simmons II, this Court adopted \r\n  section 429, (1) and held that a hospital owes \r\n  a common law nondelegable duty to render competent service to its emergency \r\n  room patients such that it may not avoid liability for the negligent acts of \r\n  emergency room physicians hired as independent contractors under a contract \r\n  between the hospital and a separate corporation.\r\n\r\nAlthough Simmons II involved emergency room \r\n  physicians, we did not limit our decision to such physicians. The decision was \r\n  limited, however, \"to those situations in which a patient seeks services at \r\n  the hospital as an institution, and is treated by a physician who reasonably \r\n  appears to be a hospital employee.\" Id. at 52, 533 S.E.2d at 323. The holding \r\n  did not \"encompass situations in which a patient is admitted to a hospital by \r\n  a private, independent physician whose only connection to a particular hospital \r\n  is that he or she has staff privileges to admit patients to the hospital.\" Id. \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish liability under section 429, a plaintiff must show that \r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the hospital held itself out to the public by offering to provide services; (2) the plaintiff looked to the hospital, rather than the individual physician, for care;\r\nand (3) a person in similar circumstances reasonably would have believed that the physician who treated him or her was a hospital employee.  When the\r\nplaintiff does so, the hospital will be held vicariously liable for any negligent or wrongful acts committed by the treating physician.  The hospital may attempt to\r\navoid liability for the physician's acts by demonstrating the plaintiff failed to prove these factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 51, 533 S.E.2d at 322.\r\n\r\nWe review each of these elements below.\r\n\r\nElement 1: Holding out\r\n\r\nIn her complaint, Osborne (2) alleged that McLeod \"holds itself out to the public as having specialized facilities, equipment and staff for the provision of high\r\nquality obstetrical care.\"  In an affidavit submitted in opposition to McLeod's summary judgment motion, Osborne stated that \"[t]hrough McLeod's marketing\r\nefforts the representation was made to me that McLeod had first rate physical facilities, staff, equipment and supplies for its birthing center, including a Level 3\r\nNeonatal Intensive Care Unit (hereinafter, \"NICU\"); that Dr. J. E. Harlan, Jr., was director of McLeod's NICU; and that the neonatologists were an integral part\r\nof McLeod's NICU team.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, Osborne submitted a three-part article appearing in McLeod Magazine (3) extolling McLeod's facilities and referring to \"McLeod neonatologists.\"  The\r\narticle depicts Dr. Harlan standing in front of what appears to be medical equipment with his arm outstretched, and refers to Harlan as McLeod's Neonatal\r\nIntensive Care Unit Director.  The article lauds the excellent facilities and care available to newborns and expectant mothers at McLeod.     \r\n\r\nElement 2: Plaintiff looked to hospital, \r\n  rather than individual physician\r\n\r\nIn her affidavit, Osborne stated:  \"I selected McLeod as the hospital where I planned to have my delivery, and obtain any incidental medical services related to\r\nmy pregnancy, labor, delivery and newborn care.\"  She continued: \"[a]t no time did I select these neonatologists to care for my baby.  Rather, I selected McLeod\r\nas the hospital to provide any and all healthcare needs which might arise incident to my labor and delivery and the newborn care for my son. . . .  I had no\r\nknowledge that these neonatologists were employed by their own professional association, as opposed to being employed directly by McLeod.  To my\r\nknowledge they were the only neonatologists working at McLeod. . . .  I thought all of my son's health care [sic] services at the McLeod NICU were being\r\nprovided by McLeod, and did not realize the neonatologists were independently employed.\"\r\n\r\nElement 3: Reasonable belief that service \r\n  is being provided by hospital\r\n\r\nIn addition to the McLeod Magazine article mentioned in the discussion of Element 1, above, Osborne stated in her affidavit that \"I had been exposed to [the\r\nMcLeod Magazine] articles early in my pregnancy, and they reinforced my belief that the neonatologists were not separately employed, but were an integral part\r\nof McLeod's professional NICU team.  I do not recall any marketing materials about McLeod's NICU making a distinction between the nurses/technicians\r\nbeing hospital employees and the neonatologists being independently employed.\"\r\n\r\nViewing this evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to Osborne, she has made a prima facie showing of the elements required \r\n  in Simmons II. The McLeod Magazine article is evidence that McLeod held \r\n  itself out as providing top-notch neonatal services; Osborne avers in her affidavit \r\n  that she believed the neonatologists were McLeod employees; and, in light of \r\n  the magazine article, and the other evidence adduced, a finder of fact could \r\n  infer that her belief was reasonable.\r\n\r\nWe are not convinced by McLeod's argument that \r\n  this case is distinguishable from Simmons II due to the fact that all \r\n  hospitals are required to have emergency rooms while they are not mandated to \r\n  have NICUs. The rule announced in Simmons II contains no requirement \r\n  that the service be mandated by law before a plaintiff can recover based on \r\n  section 429. We decline to add such a requirement. (4) \r\n  We note that although McLeod was not mandated by law to maintain a NICU, the \r\n  hospital sought and acquired a Level III designation from the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Health and Environmental Control. In order to achieve this designation, \r\n  McLeod was required to have the services of a neonatologist available. See \r\n  24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-16 Â§ 608.3 (1992).\r\n\r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\n Should the holding in Simmons II \r\n  apply prospectively only? \r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nOsborne's recovery against McLeod might yet be \r\n  foreclosed if we decide, as McLeod urges, that the holding in Simmons II \r\n  should apply prospectively only. \"[T]he general rule regarding retroactive application \r\n  of judicial decisions is that decisions creating new substantive rights have \r\n  prospective effect only, whereas decisions creating new remedies to vindicate \r\n  existing rights are applied retrospectively. . . . Prospective application is \r\n  required when liability is created where formerly none existed.\" Toth v. \r\n  Square D Co., 298 S.C. 6, 8, 377 S.E.2d 584, 585 (1989) (internal citations \r\n  omitted). \"Other cases which have held prospective application to be appropriate \r\n  include those in which immunities have been dissolved.\" Id. at 9, 377 \r\n  S.E.2d at 586.\r\n\r\nIn Toth, the Court had to determine whether \r\n  its earlier holding in Small v. Springs Industries, Inc., 292 S.C. 481, \r\n  357 S.E.2d 452 (1987), should apply prospectively only. In Small, the \r\n  Court held that employee handbooks were admissible as evidence of a contract \r\n  of employment. The Toth defendants, employers being sued by former employees \r\n  for breach of contract, argued that Small created new contractual obligations, \r\n  and therefore, should apply prospectively only. The Court declined to so limit \r\n  Small. It reasoned that the Small holding recognized no new right \r\n  or cause of action, nor did it abolish any previous immunities. The Court continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Small involved an action for breach of \r\n    contract. It is elementary that a cause of action for breach of contract is \r\n    not a new one. Respondent argues that Small \"substantially altered \r\n    the doctrine of employment at-will to create contractual obligations . . . \r\n    where none had existed before.\" We do not agree that a new contractual obligation \r\n    has been created. The companies themselves previously created the contractual \r\n    obligations through promises made in employee handbooks. . . . Employers cannot \r\n    now be allowed to retract their promises and ignore handbooks they have drafted.\r\n\r\n\r\nToth, 298 S.C. at 9, 377 S.E.2d at 586. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy analogy, Osborne's claims sound in negligence - hardly a novel cause of action.  She alleges that McLeod represented that the neonatologists were hospital\r\nemployees, not independent contractors.  She argues, in essence, that now McLeod seeks to retract its representation and shield itself from liability for the\r\nneonatologists' negligence.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Simmons II did not abolish \r\n  an immunity, it merely clarified the common law of this State. The Court framed \r\n  the issue in that case as whether \"the Court of Appeals err[ed] in holding that \r\n  hospitals have a nondelegable duty under the common law to \r\n  render competent service to the patients of their emergency rooms[.]\" Simmons \r\n  II, 341 S.C. at 38, 533 S.E.2d 315 (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nA portion of that opinion explains that \r\n\r\n\r\n[t]his Court and the Court of Appeals have applied the nondelegable duty doctrine in several situations.  An employer has a nondelegable duty to employees to\r\nprovide a reasonably safe work place and suitable tools, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by unsafe activities or tools under the employer's\r\ncontrol.  A landlord who undertakes repair of his property by use of a contractor has a nondelegable duty to see that the repair is done properly, and remains\r\nvicariously liable for injuries caused by improper repairs.  \r\n\r\nA common carrier has a nondelegable duty to ensure that cargo is properly loaded and secured, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by an\r\nunsecured load.  A bail bondsman has a nondelegable duty to supervise the work of his employees, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by those\r\nemployees.  A municipality has a nondelegable duty to provide safe streets even when maintenance is undertaken by the state Highway Department, and\r\nremains vicariously liable for injuries caused by defective repairs.  \r\n\r\nTuomey Regional mentions some of the above cases and argues they are distinguishable because in this case it is the independent-contractor physician - not the\r\nhospital - who controls a patient's medical treatment.  Tuomey Regional also contends regulations promulgated by the state Department of Health and\r\nEnvironmental Control do not impose such a duty.\r\n\r\nWe find Tuomey Regional's arguments unpersuasive.  The cited cases clearly illustrate that a person or entity entrusted with important duties in certain\r\ncircumstances may not assign those duties to someone else and then expect to walk away unscathed when things go wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 42-44, 533 S.E.2d at 317-18 (internal \r\n  citations omitted).\r\n\r\nHere, if we apply the Simmons II rule retroactively, \r\n  Osborne will only recover against McLeod if she proves the neonatologists' negligence \r\n  proximately caused harm to her son. Applying the rule to McLeod in this case \r\n  would be no different than applying the rule to the defendant-hospital in Simmons \r\n  II.\r\n\r\nBecause Simmons II did not create a new \r\n  cause of action or abolish any existing immunity, but merely recognized a new \r\n  remedy to vindicate existing rights, we apply the rule articulated in that case \r\n  retroactively.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOsborne has made a prima facie showing of \r\nthe existence of a genuine issue of material facts, and because the rule of Simmons \r\nII applies retroactively, the grant of summary judgment in favor of McLeod \r\nwas error. We therefore REVERSE the opinion of the Court of Appeals. \r\n(5) \r\n         TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Section 429, Restatement (Second) of Torts, provides:\r\n\r\nOne who employs an independent contractor to perform services for another which are accepted in the reasonable belief that the services are being rendered by\r\nthe employer or by his servants, is subject to liability for physical harm caused by the negligence of the contractor in supplying such services, to the same extent\r\nas though the employer were supplying them himself or by his servants.\r\n\r\n2. Osborne was employed as a pharmacist at McLeod at the time of her delivery.  Nothing in the record, however, indicates that she had knowledge of the fact\r\nthat the neonatologists at McLeod were employed as independent contractors.\r\n3. There appears to be some dispute as to whether McLeod Magazine is an advertising vehicle aimed at attracting patients to McLeod, or a professional\r\nrecruitment tool designed to attract healthcare providers to the hospital.\r\n4. We stress that the decision we announce today only finds that Osborne has presented some evidence that McLeod had a nondelegable duty as defined in\r\nSection 429 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  We intimate no opinion as to whether Osborne will prevail after a full airing of the facts.\r\n5. We recognize that neither \r\n  the trial court which granted summary judgment, nor the Court of Appeals was \r\n  guided by our decision in Simmons II at the time they rendered their \r\n  decisions in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25321","title":"Brown v.

Howe.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  This Court granted Curtis Brown's (\"Brown\") request for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision in Brown v. Theos,\r\n338 S.C. 305, 526 S.E.2d 232 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nFACTUAL/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Brown was indicted for trafficking in cocaine and three counts of distribution of cocaine.  A jury convicted Brown in December 1993, and Brown was\r\nsentenced to confinement for a period of twenty-five years and fined $50,000.00 for trafficking in cocaine, and fifteen years and fined $25,000.00 for\r\ndistribution of cocaine.  At trial, Brown was represented by Jerry N. Theos (\"Theos\") and Arthur G. Howe (\"Howe\").  Theos, Howe, and Coming B. Gibbs\r\n(\"Gibbs\") (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Attorneys\") represented Brown on direct appeal.  Brown's convictions and sentences were affirmed by this\r\nCourt on direct appeal.  State v. Brown, Op. No. 95-MO-200 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 19, 1995).  Brown then filed an application  for post-conviction relief\r\n(\"PCR\"), alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.  After a hearing, the trial court found counsel ineffective, and granted Brown a new trial.  Thereafter, Brown\r\nentered a plea of no contest to one count of trafficking cocaine and three counts of distribution of cocaine.  He was sentenced to eight years confinement.\r\n\r\nAfter entering the no contest plea, Brown brought a legal malpractice action against Theos and Howe alleging that but for their grossly negligent representation,\r\nhe would have fared better at trial and would not have been convicted through a plea of no contest or otherwise.  Against all Attorneys, Brown alleged but for\r\ntheir grossly negligent representation in his direct appeal, his convictions would have been reversed, and he would not have entered a no contest plea to the\r\ncharges or otherwise been convicted.  The trial judge granted the Attorneys' motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, despite Brown's assertion\r\nhis no contest plea could not be used against him in a subsequent civil proceeding.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\n\r\nThis Court granted Brown's petition for certiorari with respect to Question II only.  The issues now before this Court are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  In an action for legal malpractice, did the Court of Appeals err in holding Brown's nolo contendere plea broke the chain of causation and that Brown is not\r\nentitled to relief based on any theory of the case following such a plea?\r\n\r\nII.  Should this Court overrule In re Anderson, 255 S.C. 56, 177 S.E.2d 130 (1970)?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nBrown argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding he had no cause of action for legal malpractice because his no contest plea broke the chain of causation,\r\nand the plea, not his Attorney's negligence, was the cause of Brown's incarceration.  \r\n\r\nIn order to prevail in this action for legal malpractice, Brown must prove: (1) Attorneys' were negligent; (2) Attorneys' negligence proximately caused his\r\ninjuries; and (3) damages.  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997).  Brown must show he \"most probably would have been successful\" in  the\r\naction if Attorneys had not committed the alleged malpractice.  Summer, supra; Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 365 S.E.2d 24 (1988).  Attorneys will not be\r\nliable where, notwithstanding the attorney's negligence, the client had no meritorious defense to the suit in the first place.  Floyd v. Kosko, 285 S.C. 390, 329\r\nS.E.2d 459 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\nThis Court has not addressed the proximate cause question in a criminal case.  For several reasons, we find Brown has no cause of action for legal malpractice.  \r\n\r\nThe trial court's order and the Court of Appeals' opinion correctly notes that in an action for legal malpractice based on conviction of a crime the general\r\nstandard is the plaintiff must show innocence of the crime in order to establish liability.  See 3 Ronald E. Mallen &amp; Jeffrey M. Smith, Legal Malpractice, Â§ 25.3\r\n(4th ed. 1996).  Brown has not alleged he is innocent or even that he would have been acquitted if his Attorneys' had not committed the alleged malpractice. \r\nBrown's complaints do not allege facts that purport to show he is innocent of all the criminal charges filed against him.  Therefore, Brown's failure to plead\r\ninnocence is fatal to his cause of action.  \r\n\r\n  \"A plea of nolo contendre literally interpreted means 'I do not wish to contend.' For all practical purposes it is a plea of guilty in so far as the consequences  in\r\nthe particular case in which it is pled.\"    Kibler v. State, 267 S.C. 250, 254, 227 S.E.2d 199, 201 (1976).  South Carolina courts have recognized there are\r\ncollateral benefits to a plea of no contest and such a plea cannot be used as an admission of guilt against a defendant in civil litigation.  Kibler, supra; In re\r\nAnderson, supra (a no contest plea may not be used as substantive evidence of guilt in a subsequent civil proceeding). However, a no contest plea may be used\r\nas a record of conviction for impeachment purposes in a subsequent proceeding.  State v. Lynn, 277 S.C. 222, 284 S.E.2d 786 (1981) (recognizing a no contest\r\nplea is equivalent to a conviction and has many similarities to a plea of guilty).\r\n\r\nIn the context of a legal malpractice case, we find a claimant's plea of no contest to the same charges (or charges arising from the same conduct) should operate\r\nas a bar to a legal malpractice action against the attorney who originally represented the claimant. (1)  Brown's no contest plea, not his Attorneys' negligence,\r\ncaused his incarceration.  Because a no contest plea is a conviction, and, for all practical purposes, it is a guilty plea so far as the consequences are concerned,\r\nwe find public policy is not offended by forbidding a client from bringing a legal malpractice action against his criminal attorney after the client has pled no\r\ncontest to the charges. (2)\r\n\r\nWe find persuasive the reasoning behind cases in other jurisdictions.   For example, in Gomez v. Peters, 470 S.E.2d 692 (Ga. Ct. App. 1996), the client Gomez\r\nwas convicted after a criminal trial in which attorney Peters represented him.  Gomez then obtained new counsel and was granted a new trial after spending nine\r\nmonths in prison.  Before the new trial, Gomez entered a guilty plea  (3) for a lesser included offense, and was released on time served. (4)  Gomez then filed a\r\nlegal malpractice claim against Peters.  The trial court dismissed the case on summary judgment.  The Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed, stating:\r\n\r\n\r\nGomez's damages were the result of his acknowledged guilt, and [therefore] he is unable to show any damage proximately caused by any alleged negligence of\r\nPeters.  \r\n\r\nIn other words, a client who has acknowledged guilt cannot assert that his attorney's poor performance caused his incarceration. . . . [T]his is true even in a\r\nsituation like this one where the plaintiff pled guilty to a lesser included offense, as long as his \"damage\" (i.e., the time he already served on the initial\r\nconviction) is no greater than what he would have had to sustain for the offense to which he pled anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nGomez, 470 S.E.2d at 695.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals rejected Brown's argument below that there was a distinction between his no contest plea and a guilty plea in this\r\ninstance.  We agree with the Court of Appeals' statement, \"Brown's plea of no contest was, for all practical purposes, a plea of guilty in the criminal matter\r\nagainst him, and the plea clearly was the cause of his incarceration.\"  Brown, 338 S.C. at 236, 526 S.E.2d at 312.  \r\n\r\nIn its opinion in the instant case, the Court of Appeals  cited with favor  Fleming v. Gardner, 658 A.2d 1074 (Me. 1995).  We also find the Maine court's\r\nreasoning persuasive.  In Fleming, client Fleming entered a guilty plea to all pending criminal charges against him while represented by the Gardners.  The\r\nGardners were relieved as counsel, and Fleming withdrew his guilty pleas. While represented by new counsel, Fleming entered new guilty pleas to the pending\r\ncharges.  The pleas were accepted.  Thereafter, Fleming attempted to sue the Gardners for malpractice, alleging their negligence was the cause of his\r\nincarceration.  The Maine Court upheld the trial court's grant of summary judgement to the Gardners, finding Fleming failed to make a claim there was any\r\nerror in the lower court's acceptance of his second guilt plea.  The Maine Court found Fleming was represented by new counsel when he entered the second\r\nguilty plea, and therefore the Gardners' allegedly negligent actions had not led to his current incarceration.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for the reasons discussed above, we find Brown has no cause of action for legal malpractice.  To the extent In re Anderson,  255 S.C. 56, 177 S.E.2d\r\n130 (1970) conflicts with our holding in this case, it is overruled. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Some Federal courts have held that a plea of nolo contendere in a state criminal action may have collateral estoppel effect in a later federal civil action\r\nbrought by the criminal defendant because the defendant in the criminal action had a reasonable and fair opportunity to litigate the criminal charges, and\r\nbecause the nolo plea constituted an admission of the truth of the facts underlying the criminal charge.  47 Am. Jur. 2d. Judgments Â§ 735 (1996); Walker v.\r\nSchaeffer, 854 F.2d 138 (6th Cir. 1988) (finding an exception to FRE 410); see also Delong v. State, 956 P.2d 937 (Ok. Ct. App. 1998)\r\n2. Rule 410, SCRE provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of the following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant who made the\r\nplea or was a participant in the plea discussions:\r\n(1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn;\r\n\r\n(2) a plea of nolo contendere; . . .  \r\n\r\n\r\nRule 410, SCRE.\r\n\r\nWe find this rule of evidence does not contemplate the type of proceeding at issue in this case and is therefore inapplicable.  Here, Brown is the plaintiff, not a\r\ndefendant. He seeks to use his no contest plea offensively for his own benefit.  This is not a case where a party attempts to use a no contest plea in a criminal\r\nmatter to prove a defendant liable in a civil proceeding.  Instead, Brown as a plaintiff is litigating whether his Attorneys' adequately advised him  during his\r\nplea negotiations.  Rule 410, SCRE was never intended to cover this type of case.  Furthermore, federal courts have found Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of\r\nEvidence does not bar use of pleas against a defendant who becomes plaintiff with respect to events in plea.  See also Walker, 854 F.2d at 143 (\"We find a\r\nmaterial difference between using the nolo contendere plea to subject a former criminal defendant to subsequent civil or criminal liability and using the plea as\r\na defense against those submitting a plea interpreted to be an admission which would preclude liability. Rule 410 was intended to protect a criminal defendant's\r\nuse of the nolo contendere plea to defend himself from future civil liability. We decline to interpret the rule so as to allow the former defendants to use the plea\r\noffensively, in order to obtain damages, after having admitted facts which would indicate no civil liability on the part of the [defendant] police.\")\r\n\r\n3. Entering a plea of no contest does operate as a conviction, as does a guilty plea.  Furthermore, as the Court noted in Lynn, supra, a no contest plea is very\r\nsimilar to a guilty plea.  \r\n4. Brown was also released shortly after pleading no contest to the charges, since he was credited with the almost eight years he had already served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25322","title":"In the Matter of The Care and Treatment of Johnny Matthews","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25322","description":"This case involves South Carolina's Sexually Violent Predator Act, the jurisdiction it confers on the circuit court, and its constitutionality.","date":"2001-07-23","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n                                   In the Matter of\r\n        The Care and Treatment of Johnny Matthews,                                               Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Charleston County\r\nA.

Heckler, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Johnny Matthews (\"Matthews\") appeals the trial court's order holding he was a sexually violent predator pursuant to the Sexually\r\nViolent Predator Act (\"Act\").  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 through 44-48-170 (Supp. 2000).  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAt the time Matthews was charged with the offenses which led to the present proceeding, he was a custodian employed at North Park Village Head Start\r\nProgram in North Charleston.  Approximately 80 children between the ages of three and five were participating in the program.  Matthews was charged with\r\neight counts of committing lewd acts upon a child.  Six charges were dropped, and Matthews pled guilty to two counts of committing lewd acts upon a child. (1) \r\nMatthews was sentenced to five years imprisonment.\r\n\r\nWith the expiration of Matthews' sentence approaching, a multidisciplinary team accessed Matthews' records pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act. \r\nOn October 1, 1998, the team found Matthews satisfied the definition of a sexually violent predator.  By order dated May 6, 1999, the court below found\r\nprobable cause and ordered Matthews into custody pending trial.\r\n\r\nOn July 16, 1999, a non-jury trial was held before the Honorable A. Victor Rawl in Charleston.  Following the trial, the trial court entered a written order\r\nfinding, beyond a reasonable doubt, Matthews was a sexually violent predator as defined by the Act and, therefore, should be committed for treatment. \r\nMatthews' constitutional arguments were rejected.\r\n\r\nMatthews filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals transferred the case to this Court pursuant to Rule 204(a), SCACR, on the\r\nground the principal issue on appeal would be a constitutional challenge to the Sexually Violent Predator Act.  The issues before this Court are:\r\n\r\n\r\nI.   Did the trial court have jurisdiction to hear the State's  civil commitment case against Matthews where the trial was held more than sixty days after the\r\nprobable cause hearing in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 2000)?\r\n\r\nII.  Did the trial court have jurisdiction over this action when only four members, instead of the five listed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50 (Supp. 2000), reviewed\r\nMatthews' records?\r\n\r\nIII.  Did the trial court err in denying Matthews' motion for a directed verdict on the ground the evidence was insufficient to show he was a sexual predator?\r\n\r\nIV.  Does South Carolina's Sexually Violent Predator Act violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Federal (2) and State (3) Constitutions?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90\r\n\r\nMatthews argues the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the State failed to bring the case to trial within the sixty day time period set forth in section 44-48-90\r\nwithout having the trial court issue a continuance. (4)  We agree the State was statutorily required to bring Matthews' case to trial within sixty days of the\r\nprobable cause hearing.  However, we disagree the State's failure to do so resulted in the trial court losing jurisdiction to hear the case.\r\n\r\nWe have stated, \"Subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.\"  Dove\r\nv. Gold Kist, 314 S.C. 235, 237-238, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (citations and internal quotations omitted).  In Gold Kist we found, \"the statute grants the\r\ncourt of common pleas throughout the State subject matter jurisdiction to hear [the litigants' case].\" Id. at 238, 442 S.E.2d at 600.  In the instant case, the Act\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin sixty days after the completion of a hearing held pursuant to Section 44-48-80 [probable cause], the court shall conduct a trial to determine whether the\r\nperson is a sexually violent predator . . . . The trial may be continued upon the request of either party and a showing of good cause, or by the court on its own\r\nmotion in the due administration of justice, and only if the respondent will not be substantially prejudiced.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 2000) (emphasis added).  The definition section of the Act provides: \"Court means the court of common pleas.\"  S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 44-48-30 (7) (Supp. 2000) (emphasis added).  Therefore, the language of the statute clearly vests subject matter jurisdiction over cases brought pursuant\r\nto the Act with the court of common pleas.\r\n\r\nEven though we find the court of common pleas had subject matter jurisdiction to hear Matthews' case, we do find the legislature's use of the term \"shall\" in\r\nsection 44-48-90 indicates the holding of a trial within sixty days of the probable cause hearing is mandatory. See, e.g., South Carolina Police Officers\r\nRetirement Sys. v. Spartanburg, 301 S.C. 188, 391 S.E.2d 239 (1990) (\"shall\" is considered mandatory under principles of statutory interpretation); South\r\nCarolina Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp. v. Dickinson, 288 S.C. 189, 191, 341 S.E.2d 134, 135 (\"Ordinarily the use of the word 'shall' in a statute means\r\nthat the action referred to is mandatory.\"). The language of the Act does allow a trial to be held outside the sixty day period, but only under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is not a significant burden on the State or the trial court to require the issuance of a continuance, or even a notation in the record, indicating: (1) the trial\r\ncannot be held within sixty days; (2) good cause for the delay; and (3) the respondent will not suffer prejudice.  Furthermore, the fact that the legislature set\r\nforth the terms under which a trial could be held outside the sixty day period is further evidence of the legislature's intent to require strict adherence to the\r\nmandated time frame.\r\n\r\nHowever, we find the sixty day time period set forth in the Act is not a jurisdictional requirement.  Matthews should have filed a motion to dismiss when the\r\nState failed to bring the case to trial within sixty days without asking for a continuance.  By failing to make a motion to dismiss, Matthews waived his right to\r\nchallenge the State's failure to comply with the requisite time period.\r\n\r\n  Therefore, we hold the State's failure to comply with the time period set forth in the section, when a proper continuance has not been issued, does not deprive\r\nthe court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case.  When the sixty day period has passed, and no continuance has been granted, the proper procedure for a\r\nrespondent to follow is to file a motion to dismiss.\r\n\r\nII.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50\r\n\r\nMatthews argues the trial court lacked jurisdiction over this action because he was not properly evaluated.  He contends that the court's jurisdiction is\r\npredicated on the multidisciplinary team's conclusion he was a sexually violent predator.  He asserts that the action of the multidisciplinary team was void ab\r\ninitio because the make-up of the multidisciplinary team did not comply with the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50 (Supp. 2000). (5)  We disagree.\r\n\r\nBefore an action is commenced under the Act, the Director of the Department of Corrections appoints a multidisciplinary team to review the records of the\r\nalleged predator.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50 (Supp. 2000).  The team assesses whether or not the person meets the definition of a sexually violent predator.  Id. \r\nIf the team determines the person is a predator, the case is then referred to the prosecutor review committee.  The Act provides:\r\n\r\nMembership of the [multidisciplinary] team must include:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)   a representative from the Department of Corrections;\r\n\r\n (2)  a representative from the Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services;\r\n\r\n  (3)   a representative from the Department of Mental Health who is a trained, qualified mental health clinician with expertise in treating sexually violent\r\noffenders;\r\n\r\n (4)   a retired judge appointed by the Chief Justice who is eligible for continued judicial service pursuant to Section 2-19-100; and\r\n\r\n (5)   the Chief Attorney of the Office of Appellate Defense or his designee.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-40 (Supp. 2000) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThis section is written in mandatory language.  See South Carolina Police Officers Retirement Sys., supra (\"must\" is considered mandatory under the principles\r\nof statutory construction).    The statute requires the multidisciplinary team to consist of five members.  However, it does not require all five members of the\r\nteam to be present at all meetings.  The normal rules which govern the proceedings of a governmental body should apply.\r\n\r\n\"In the absence of any statutory or other controlling provision, the common-law rule that a majority of the whole board is necessary to constitute a quorum\r\napplies, and the board may do no valid act in the absence of a quorum.\"  Garris v. Governing Bd. of the State Reinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 453, 511\r\nS.E.2d 48, 58 (1998) (citations omitted).  Section 44-48-50 contains no special provision requiring all members of the team to be present, nor does it contain a\r\nrequirement that the decisions of the team be unanimous or made by any majority other than a simple majority.  Here, four members of the team met and\r\nunanimously decided Matthews qualified as a sexually violent predator under the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\nWe hold the plain language of the statute indicates the team must consist of five members, but does not require that all be present to issue the report.  A\r\nmajority decision by a quorum of the team was made in this case, and, therefore, Matthews' arguments regarding this issue are without merit.\r\n\r\nIII.  Directed Verdict\r\n\r\nMatthews argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on the ground the evidence was insufficient to show he was a sexually violent\r\npredator.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nOn an appeal from the trial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the appellate court may only reverse the trial court if there is no evidence to support\r\nthe trial court's ruling.  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, 334 S.C. 469, 514 S.E.2d 126 (1999).  In ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial\r\ncourt is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.  State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 551-552, 514 S.E.2d 584, 590 (1999).\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30 (1)(b) defines \"sexually violent predator\" as someone who \"suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes\r\nthe person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.\"  Subsection 9 goes on to say\r\n\"the person's propensity to commit acts of sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of others.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(9) (Supp. 2000).  \"Mental Abnormality\" is defined in the Act as a \"condition affecting a person's emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the\r\nperson to commit sexually violent offenses.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(3).  We find more than sufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion\r\nMatthews suffers from uncontrollable behavior.  Matthews' arguments concerning the evidence simply go to the weight of the evidence not its sufficiency.\r\n\r\nDr. Elin Barth Berg testified on behalf of the State.  Dr. Berg conducted a three hour interview with Matthews, and spent four hours reviewing the records\r\nsupplied by the Attorney General.  Dr. Berg testified Matthews suffers from pedophilia.  She stated Matthews has a \"probable risk of recidivism of sexually\r\nviolent acts in the community,\" and it was \"more likely than not\" that Matthews would re-offend.  Dr. Berg further described a pedophile's urges as \"irresistible\r\n. . . a response to a irresistible impulse.\"  She stated, in her medical opinion, Matthews was at \"above average risk\" to re-offend.  She concluded, \"he is -- and\r\nI'm offering my opinion based on educational and clinical experience -- at this time a better candidate for in-patient treatment.  And the reason is he still\r\nexpresses that he does not believe that he has a problem. . .\" (6)  After hearing the testimony, the trial court concluded \"beyond a reasonable doubt . . .\r\n[Matthews] suffers from a mental defect or personality disorder which makes him likely to engage in further acts of sexual violence if he is not confined for\r\nlong-term control, care, and treatment.\"\r\n\r\nWe find sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial judge's denial of Matthews' motion for a directed verdict.\r\n\r\n    IV.  Double Jeopardy Challenge\r\n\r\nMatthews argues the trial court erred in concluding the Act does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Federal (7) and State (8) Constitutions.  We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nA.  Federal Constitution\r\n\r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that no one shall \"be subject\r\nfor the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. CONST. amend. V.\r\n\r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.  Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 53 L. Ed. 2d 187\r\n(1977).  However, the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated only in criminal proceedings.  U.S. CONST. amend. V; S.C. CONST. art. I, Â§ 12; In the Matter of\r\nChastain, 340 S.C. 356, 532 S.E.2d 264 (2000).  As the United States Supreme Court recently reiterated, the determination whether a statute is civil or criminal\r\nis primarily a question of statutory construction, which must begin by  reference to the act's text and legislative history.  Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S.\r\nCt. 727, 148 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2001).  Where the legislature has manifested its intent that the legislation is civil in nature, the party challenging that classification\r\nmust provide \"the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate the [legislature's] intention.\"  Id.  Our Act\r\nspecifies the purpose of the Act is civil commitment. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20.  Matthews, therefore, bears this heavy burden.  \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina's Act is modeled on Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act.  The United States Supreme Court held Kansas' Act is a civil, non-punitive\r\nscheme.  Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S. Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed. 2d 501 (1997).  Matthews contends there are differences in the language of our Act\r\nand the Kansas Act, thereby effectively distinguishing the United States Supreme Court's holding in Hendricks.  We find Matthews does not effectively\r\ndistinguish the Kansas Act from our own.  Therefore, we hold South Carolina's Act does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court held the Kansas Act was civil rather than criminal based on numerous factors:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) it did not implicate retribution or deterrence;\r\n\r\n(2) prior criminal convictions were used as evidence, but were not a prerequisite for commitment;\r\n\r\n(3) no evidence of scienter was necessary for a commitment;\r\n\r\n(4) the Act was not intended to be a deterrent;\r\n\r\n(5) release is dependent upon the stated purpose of the Act, that is, once the person is no longer a threat to others;\r\n\r\n(6) the provision of procedural safeguards similar to those found in criminal proceedings do not transform a civil proceeding into a criminal one;\r\n\r\n(7) the lack of treatment for those deemed untreatable does not transform detention from civil to criminal; and\r\n\r\n(8) confinement in a segregated unit within a prison is not dispositive because the person has been found a danger to the community, and the circumstances are\r\nessentially the same as for other involuntarily committed persons in mental hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHendricks, supra; Seling, supra.\r\n\r\nApplying these factors to the Act, we find the only distinction that can be made is South Carolina's Act defines a sexually violent predator as a person with a\r\nprior conviction for a sexually violent offense (factor 2, supra.).  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1).  The use of the word \"conviction\" is somewhat misleading,\r\nhowever, since under the Act it includes persons charged but found incompetent to stand trial, those found not guilty by reason of insanity, and those found\r\nguilty but mentally ill.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(6)(c),(d), and (e) (Supp. 2000).  Therefore, we find this is a distinction without a difference.\r\n\r\nMatthews attempts to distinguish South Carolina's Act and the United States Supreme Court's holding in Hendricks on three grounds.  First, he argues the face\r\nof South Carolina's Act shows the General Assembly intended the Act to be punitive since: (1) it places upon the \"prosecutorial arm\" of the State the\r\nresponsibility for bringing petitions under the Act; and (2) it was placed in the health section of the South Carolina Code.  The fact the South Carolina Attorney\r\nGeneral's office files the commitment petition does not effectively distinguish South Carolina's Act since the Kansas Act also directs the Attorney General's\r\noffice to file the appropriate petition.  See Kan. Code Ann. Â§ 59-29a04.  Furthermore, the Attorney General's office responsible for bringing these cases in\r\nSouth Carolina is a branch of the civil division.  Finally, there is no logical connection between who brings the case and the degree to which the result is\r\n\"punitive.\"\r\n\r\nMatthews also argues South Carolina's Act is punitive on its face and is distinguishable from the Kansas Act since the General Assembly placed the Act into\r\nthe health section of the Code instead of the probate section.  This argument is without merit.  The health section of the code also includes the provisions for\r\ninvoluntary commitment of the mentally ill.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-17-410.  Furthermore, simply because South Carolina's Act is placed in a title which\r\nprovides for a few criminal offenses on unrelated topics is not evidence the Act is \"punitive.\"\r\n\r\n  Secondly, Matthews argues South Carolina's Act is \"retributive.\"  The United States Supreme Court in Hendricks specifically held the Kansas Act was not\r\nretributive.  See Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 362.  Matthews argues nothing that was not rejected in Hendricks.  We agree with the United States Supreme Court's\r\nanalysis and hold our Act is not \"retributive.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, Matthews argues he is subject to the conditions placed on state prisoners, and he will not receive treatment for his alleged disease.  The conditions of\r\nconfinement are not prescribed by the Act, but result from administrative decisions.  Therefore, the conditions of confinement cannot be used to determine\r\nlegislative intent.  Cf., Myrtle Beach Hosp. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (2000) (executive agency policies are not evidence of legislative\r\nintent).  Furthermore, the Act expressly provides, \"The involuntary detention or commitment of a person pursuant to this chapter shall conform to constitutional\r\nrequirements for care and treatment.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-170.\r\n\r\nMatthews has failed to meet his burden of showing the Act is punitive in nature.  Seling, supra.  We find the United States Supreme Court's decision in\r\nHendricks is controlling and, therefore, South Carolina's Act does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nB.  State Constitution\r\n\r\nMatthews also contends the Act violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the South Carolina Constitution.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe have expressly held the Double Jeopardy Clause of the South Carolina Constitution does not afford broader protection than its federal counterpart.  State v.\r\nEasler, 327 S.C. 121, 132, 489 S.E.2d 617, 623 (1997) (\"[T]he courts of this state have never interpreted the state double jeopardy provision independently of\r\nthe Fifth Amendment. . . . [W]e decline to extend broader protection under our state constitution than that afforded under the federal constitution.\"].  As\r\ndiscussed above, Matthews has not distinguished Kansas' Act from our own.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we hold South Carolina's Act does not violate the double jeopardy provision of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the trial court. \r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. These were pleas under North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970).\r\n2. U.S. CONST. amend. V.\r\n3. S.C. CONST. art. I, Â§ 12.\r\n4. Although Matthews did not challenge the trial court's subject-matter jurisdiction, Matthews can raise the issue for the first time on appeal.  See, e.g., Lake v.\r\nReeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 248, 498 S.E.2d 650, 653 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"Lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for\r\nthe first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.\").  \r\n5. State's Exhibit One shows the multidisciplinary team which reviewed Matthews' records did not include a representative from the Office of Appellate\r\nDefense.\r\n6. There is other testimony by Dr. Berg which supports the trial judge's decision not to grant a directed verdict.  However, in light of the standard of review,\r\nthese few excerpts provide enough evidence to show the trial judge did not err in his refusal to grant the directed verdict.\r\n7. U.S. CONST. amend.

Woodington, and  Assistant\r\nAttorney General Steven G. Heckler, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:   Appellant was found to be a sexually violent predator (SVP) by a jury and committed to the Department of Mental Health (DMH)\r\nfor control, care, and treatment pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§44-48-100 (Supp. 2000).  He has appealed, raising both trial errors and constitutional issues.  We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. Mootness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first issue we address is the State's contention \r\n  that appellant's release from DMH's custody during the pendency of this appeal \r\n  renders it moot. Under the SVP Act, (1) (Act) \r\n  a person who is committed pursuant to the Act is entitled to an annual review \r\n  of his status, Â§44-48-110, or may be released at any time upon the petition \r\n  of the Director of DMH. Â§44-48-120. There exists the very real possibility, \r\n  then, that many SVP appellants will be released before their appeals can be \r\n  concluded. Since most of the issues raised by appellant are 'capable of repetition \r\n  but evading review,' we decline to dismiss the appeal on mootness grounds. Byrd \r\n  v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n    B. Civil or Criminal Statute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the Act is violative of his \r\n  double jeopardy and ex post facto rights because, although nominally civil in \r\n  nature, it is in fact punitive. At trial, (2) \r\n  he did not attempt to distinguish our SVP Act from the Kansas Act upon which \r\n  it was modeled, and which the United States Supreme Court has held is a civil, \r\n  non-punitive scheme. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, \r\n  138 L.Ed. 2d 501 (1997). Although appellant now argues on appeal that various \r\n  features of our Act distinguish it from the Kansas Act, these claims were not \r\n  raised below and, accordingly, are not properly before us now. E.g., \r\n  Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996). The only issue \r\n  properly before us is whether the Act, on its face, constitutes additional criminal \r\n  punishment.\r\n\r\nWe hold today in In the Matter of Matthews, \r\n  Op. No. 25322 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 23, 2001) Shearouse Adv. Sh. 26 at p. \r\n  45 that a side by side comparison of our SVP Act and the Kansas Act does not \r\n  reveal any substantial differences. On this record, appellant has failed to \r\n  meet his burden of showing \"clearest proof\" that the Act on its face is punitive \r\n  rather than civil in nature.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n    C. Constitutional Claims\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends that the conditions of his confinement demonstrate that he is being improperly punished as a criminal.  We find his remedy for any such\r\nunconstitutional confinement would be by writ of habeas corpus, (3) and that in any case his release from DMH during this appeal renders moot this claim.  We\r\nnote that the Act provides that a person committed pursuant to it shall be kept in a secure facility, Â§44-48-100 (A), and that his commitment \"shall conform to\r\nconstitutional requirements for care and treatment.\" Â§44-48-170.  If these requirements are not honored by the custodian, then relief lies with an action brought\r\nagainst that individual, and not with a facial challenge to the statute which does not prescribe the terms of confinement.\r\n\r\nWe decline to reach the merits of appellant's substantive due process claims made pursuant to the state (4) and federal (5) constitutions, finding they are not\r\npreserved for our review.  The record contains a single reference to a substantive due process claim, apparently made during the probable cause hearing.  The\r\nreference, in its entirety, is:\r\n\r\nWe believe that [the Act] violates the U.S. and South Carolina Constitution [sic] in that it denies [appellant] as applied to this case his due process rights under\r\nthe 14th Amendment and, of course, article one, section three of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no ruling on this conclusory allegation, \r\n  and therefore it is not properly before the Court. Taylor v. Medenica, \r\n  supra; cf., Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d \r\n  731 (1998) (objection must state grounds).\r\n\r\nFurther, it is this Court's firm policy to decline \r\n  to rule on constitutional issues unless such a ruling is required. Fairway \r\n  Ford, Inc. v. County of Greenville, 324 S.C. 84, 476 S.E.2d 490 (1996). \r\n  A constitutional claim must be raised and ruled upon to be preserved for appellate \r\n  review. Hoffman v. Powell, 298 S.C. 338, 380 S.E.2d 821 (1989). A bald \r\n  assertion, without supporting argument, does not preserve an issue for appeal. \r\n  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, supra. We decline to reach appellant's \r\n  federal and state due process claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n    D. Trial Errors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant raises three trial errors, two of which are not preserved for appeal.\r\n\r\nFirst, he claims the trial court erroneously denied \r\n  his directed verdict and motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (jnov) \r\n  because the evidence was insufficient to establish that he was a SVP. At trial, \r\n  appellant made only a general directed verdict motion, stating, \"I think [the \r\n  State has] failed to meet their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \r\n  This motion, which stated no specific ground, preserved nothing for appellate \r\n  review. E.g., Connolly v. People's Life Ins. Co., 299 S.C. 348, \r\n  384 S.E.2d 738 (1989). Further, since only grounds raised in the directed verdict \r\n  motion may properly be reasserted in the jnov motion, and since no grounds were \r\n  raised in the directed verdict motion, no jnov claim is preserved for our review. \r\n  E.g., Duncan v. Hampton County School District #2, 335 S.C. 535, \r\n  517 S.E.2d 449 (Ct. App. 1999), cert. denied Sept. 24, 1999.\r\n\r\nNext, appellant argues that the State's closing \r\n  argument was improper. Appellant interposed no contemporaneous objection to \r\n  the argument and thus no issue regarding it is preserved for appellate review. \r\n  The failure to make a contemporaneous objection can be excused only when the \r\n  challenged argument constitutes abuse of a party or witness. Dial v. Niggel \r\n  Associates, Inc., 333 S.C. 253, 509 S.E. 2d 269 (1999). The argument about \r\n  which appellant now complains does not fall within the Dial exception, \r\n  and therefore we decline to address the merits of this issue.\r\n\r\nAppellant's third claim of trial error relates to the trial court's jury instructions.  As explained below, we find no error.\r\n\r\nAppellant first contends the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing his request to charge the \"full expression\" of legislative intent found in Â§44-48-20. \r\nHe also contends the trial judge erred when he recharged the jury in response to its question.  Finally, he argues that the jury charge violated equal protection. \r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Â§44-48-20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge, paraphrasing the statute entitled \"Legislative Findings,\" Â§44-48-20, charged the jury:\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I told you earlier that the State has brought this case under the Sexually Violent Predator Act of our Code of Laws.  Our General Assembly has\r\ndetermined that those persons who are found to be sexually violent predators under the law will require involuntary civil commitment in a secure facility for\r\nlong-term control, care and treatment.\r\n\r\nIn this case that usually means the Department of Mental Health or the Department of Corrections, depending on the circumstances.  Additionally the General\r\nAssembly has determined that the existing civil commitment process is inadequate to address the special needs of sexually violent predators and has therefore\r\ndetermined that a separate involuntary civil commitment process is necessary for long-term control, care and treatment of sexually violent predators.\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, the intent of the legislature in passing this law does not in any way control your decision in this case.  You and you alone must decide\r\nwhether or not [appellant] is, in fact, a sexually violent predator under the law.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge committed reversible error in omitting from this paraphrase of Â§44-48-20 its first sentence, \"The General Assembly finds that\r\na mentally abnormal and extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exists which require involuntary civil commitment in a secure facility for\r\nlong-term control, care and treatment.\"  Appellant argues the language should have been charged, because it  would have permitted him to argue that the\r\nlegislation was targeted to a discreet group of extremely dangerous sexual predators, and that he did not fit this category.  We find no error.\r\n\r\nThere was no error in the general charge, which \r\n  gave the jury the background of the issue they were being asked to decide, followed \r\n  by a charge defining the terms which the State must prove beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt. Despite the expression of intent in Â§44-48-20, the actual burden on the \r\n  State to show that an individual is a SVP does not require a showing of \"extreme \r\n  danger.\" See Â§Â§44-48-100; 44-48-30(1)(b); (3); (9). \"A jury charge is correct \r\n  if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and \r\n  adequately covers the law.\" Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., \r\n  334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999) (internal citations omitted). The charge \r\n  given was proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Recharge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his initial charge, the trial judge told the jury that the \"first element\" that the State must show is that appellant had a prior conviction for a sexually violent\r\noffense.  He then charged the jury:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second element the State must prove is that the Respondent suffers from a mental abnormality or from a personality disorder that makes him likely to\r\nengage in acts of sexual violence if he is not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care and treatment.\r\n\r\nNow, in order for you to understand these elements a little bit better, I am also going to define a couple of the terms which I just used.  We used the term mental\r\nabnormality.  What do we mean by the term mental abnormality?\r\n\r\nThat means a mental condition affecting a person's emotional or volitional capability that predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses.\r\n\r\nThe term also we [sic] used was likely to engage in acts of sexual violence.  What do we mean by that?  That means this.  It means a person's propensity to\r\ncommit acts of sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no objection to this portion of the charge.\r\n\r\nThe jury later requested to be recharged on the \"second element\" of the law.  The judge indicated he would remind them of the first element (conviction of a\r\nsexually violent offense) and then recharge the second element.  He did so.  Following that charge, appellant objected to the \"undue stress\" placed on the\r\ndefinitions of \"mental abnormality\" and \"likely to engage in acts of sexual violence.\"  He argued that the judge should emphasize equally the portion of the\r\nstatute \"if not confined to a secure facility for long-term control, care and treatment.\"  The judge declined to alter the charge.\r\n\r\nThe recharge did not emphasize two \"elements\" to the exclusion of the third.  The jury was told it must find appellant \"suffers from either a mental abnormality\r\nor personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if he is not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care and\r\ntreatment.\"  This is the definition of sexually violent predator. Â§44-48-30(1)(b).  The statute further defines \"mental abnormality,\" Â§44-48-30(3), and the jury\r\nwas recharged on that definition.  The statute also specifically defines the term  \"likely to engage in acts of sexual violence,\" Â§44-48-30(9), and this statutory\r\ndefinition was charged.   The judge then repeated the general definition of sexually violent predator, including the \"long-term\" phrase. \r\n\r\nIt is clear that the judge simply charged the statute, and where a specific term had a specific definition, charged that definition.  He did not improperly\r\nemphasize any one part of the statute at the expense of another.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. Equal Protection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In brief, appellant contends he was entitled \r\n  to a new trial, a directed verdict, and/or a jnov because the jury instruction \r\n  violated equal protection. This issue was neither raised nor ruled upon below, \r\n  and therefore is not properly before the Court. Hoffman v. Powell, supra. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    E. Funding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his trial, appellant's attorney complained appellant's due process and equal protection rights were being violated because there was no funding\r\navailable for depositions.  He did not specify whose deposition he would take were funds available. \r\n\r\nOn appeal, appellant argues that the lack of funds to depose the State's expert denied him his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  We\r\nhave determined that appellant has failed to show that this is  a criminal proceeding, and therefore the sixth amendment is not implicated.  The only right to\r\ncounsel here is appellant's statutory right to the assistance of appointed counsel, a right which was honored.  Â§44-48-90 (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\nAppellant has not shown any prejudice, much less a constitutional violation, in the denial of funds to depose unidentified individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, this appeal is  AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

The Court of Appeals held the town could not charge a permit fee for access to the property.  South Carolina Dep't of\r\nNatural Resources v. Town of McClellanville, Op. No. 2000-UP-165 (Ct. App. filed Mar. 6, 2000).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn 1991, DNR deeded a 4.27 acre tract of land to the town.  This transfer was part of a land swap between the state and federal governments to enable the town\r\nto qualify for federal funds to repair the town hall, which was damaged by Hurricane Hugo.  The parcel included the town hall, a fire tower, a boat ramp, and a\r\nparking area.  The deed contained a restriction providing that \"the parking area and boat launching ramp shall remain accessible to and remain available for use\r\nby the public.\"  At the time of the conveyance, no fee was charged for use of the boat ramp.  \r\n\r\nThe town has a population of about 360 and an annual budget of less than $200,000, $75,000 to $80,000 of which is dedicated to the fire department.  During\r\nthe period after the town took title to the land, use of the boat ramp and parking area increased dramatically.  In 1995, Charleston County Public Works, which\r\nhad previously provided maintenance for the facilities, notified the town it was unable to continue to provide that assistance.  The town commissioned a study\r\nof the facilities and a committee held public hearings to determine the best way to fund maintenance of the ramp.  \r\n\r\nIn response to the committee's findings, the town enacted an ordinance requiring users of the boat launching ramp to obtain a permit.  For $40.00 for town\r\nresidents and $90 for non-residents, the holder of a permit receives 24-hour, 365-day use of the boat launching ramp and parking lot for one year.  All revenue\r\nfrom the permits is placed into a restricted account to be used by the town \"for the sole purpose of improving, operating and maintaining the boat ramp and\r\nrelated parking area . . . and for reasonable administrative costs associated therewith.\"  \r\n\r\nDNR sought an injunction to prohibit enforcement of the ordinance, claiming the boat ramp fee violated the restrictive covenant contained in the deed.  In the\r\nshort period of time between the ordinance's enactment and the issuance of a preliminary injunction enjoining its enforcement, the town issued permits to 88\r\nresidents and 304 non-residents.  \r\n\r\nThe case was referred to the Master-in-Equity, who refused DNR's request for a permanent injunction.  The Master ruled the ordinance did not violate the deed. \r\nThe Master reasoned the deed did not address how the facilities were to be operated or maintained, but \"merely requires that the public have access to these\r\nfacilities.\"  The Master refused to read restrictions into the deed which \"DNR could have effortlessly written in itself.\"  The Circuit Court affirmed, and the\r\nCourt of Appeals reversed.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding the town's ordinance establishing a boat launching permit fee violated the covenant in the deed by which the town\r\nacquired title?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe town argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding the town's ordinance establishing a boat launching permit fee violated the covenant contained in the\r\ndeed.  The town asserts the language of the deed is ambiguous, and, even if unambiguous, the intent attributed to the parties does not comport with the language\r\nused.  We agree.\r\n\r\nAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity.  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 3, n.2, 498 S.E.2d 862, 864, n.2 (1998).  On appeal of an\r\nequitable action tried by a Master, the Court can find facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence.  Id.; Townes Assoc. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C.\r\n81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).  However, a Master's findings, concurred with by the circuit court, will not be disturbed on appeal unless without\r\nevidentiary support.  Townes Assoc., 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775-76. \r\n\r\nWe recently explained the rules for interpreting restrictive covenants in South Carolina:\r\n\r\n\r\nRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature, so that the paramount rule of construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties as determined\r\nfrom the whole document.  The court may not limit a restriction in a deed, nor, on the other hand, will a restriction be enlarged or extended by construction or\r\nimplication beyond the clear meaning of its terms even to accomplish what it may be thought the parties would have desired had a situation which later\r\ndeveloped been foreseen by them at the time when the restriction was written.  It is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to the use of real\r\nestate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, subject, however, to the provision that this rule of strict\r\nconstruction should not be applied so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument.  It follows, of course, that where the language of the\r\nrestrictions is equally capable of two or more different constructions that construction will be adopted which least restricts the use of the property.  A restriction\r\non the use of property must be created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all\r\ndoubts resolved in favor of the free use of property.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor, 332 S.C. at 4-5, 498 S.E.2d at 863-64 (emphasis added) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  In Taylor, we refused to enlarge a restrictive\r\ncovenant beyond its plain language in order to prohibit the erection of mobile homes.  \r\n\r\nThe deed at issue in this case contained the restriction that \"the parking area and boat launching ramp shall remain accessible to and remain available for use by\r\nthe public.\"  The Court of Appeals held the word \"remain\" is unambiguous and means \"to continue unchanged.\"  According to the Court of Appeals, \"[t]he\r\nonly reasonable interpretation of the deed[] is that the public's access was to continue unchanged and the availability for use by the public was to continue\r\nunchanged.\"  Thus, \"[a]ny restrictions imposed by the Town on the public's access to the Landing or on the Landing's availability for use by the public are\r\nforbidden.\" \r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals the covenant is unambiguous; however, we think the \"only reasonable interpretation of the deed,\" would not prohibit the\r\ntown from charging a permit fee.  A contract is ambiguous when the terms of the contract are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.  Hawkins\r\nv. Greenwood Development Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 338, at 345 (1991)).  It is a\r\nquestion of law for the court whether the language of a contract is ambiguous.  Id.  Once the court decides the language is ambiguous, evidence may be\r\nadmitted to show the intent of the parties.  Id.  The determination of the parties' intent is then a question of fact.  Id.  On the other hand, the construction of a\r\nclear and unambiguous deed is a question of law for the court.  Gardner v. Mozingo, 293 S.C. 23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 392 (1987).  \r\n\r\nAlthough the word \"remain\" read alone might be considered ambiguous, the covenant as a whole is not.  Nothing in the plain language of the deed prohibits the\r\ntown from requiring a permit or charging a fee to use the facilities.  Furthermore, even if the covenant is ambiguous, the Court of Appeals' construction does\r\nnot comport with the rules in Taylor.  The Master stated, and we agree, that the construction urged by DNR requires the Court to focus on the definition of one\r\nword, \"remain,\" to the exclusion of the covenant as a whole.  The deed provides that the parking area and boat launching ramp are to \"remain accessible\" and\r\n\"remain available for use by the public.\"  DNR does not, and cannot, argue the parking area and ramp are no longer accessible and available for use by the\r\npublic.  Thus it focuses on the word \"remain\" alone and argues the scope of the public's access must remain unchanged from what it was before the town took\r\ntitle to the land.\r\n\r\nThe phrases \"remain accessible\" and \"remain available for use by the public\" do not equal \"remain free and unrestricted.\" (1)  The Court of Appeals'\r\ninterpretation of the deed \"enlarg[es the restriction] . . . beyond the clear meaning of its terms.\"  Taylor, 332 S.C. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 864.  The Court of Appeals\r\nheld \"[a]ny restrictions imposed by the Town on the public's access to the Landing or on the Landing's availability for use by the public are forbidden\" by the\r\ndeed.  We do not interpret the deed as prohibiting the town from imposing any restrictions whatsoever on the public's use of the ramp in response to unforeseen\r\nfuture needs.  Under the Court of Appeals' interpretation, the town could never limit the hours of operation of the facilities, for example, in response to crime,\r\nor restrict the size of watercraft for safety purposes.  Nothing in the plain language of the deed extinguishes the town's ability to manage its own property to\r\nprotect the public welfare. \r\n\r\nDNR relies on State v. Hardee, 259 S.C. 535, 539, 193 S.E.2d 497, 499 (1972), for the proposition that \"[a] deed or grant by the State of South Carolina is\r\nconstrued strictly in favor of the State and general public and against the grantee.\"  In Hardee, the Court was called upon to determine whether the State or the\r\ngrantee held title to land below the high-water mark on a tidal navigable stream.  Hardee has little application to the instant case.  Hardee was a \"public trust\"\r\ndoctrine case, dealing with very different issues than those presented here.  In particular, Hardee did not concern the construction of a restrictive covenant. \r\nMoreover, Hardee involved rules specifically applicable when the State grants land to private individuals.  Here, the land at issue is still publicly held.  Finally,\r\nthe rule in Hardee is based \"on the ground that the grant is supposed to be made at the solicitation of the grantee, and the form and terms of the particular\r\ninstrument of grant proposed by him and submitted to the government for its allowance.\"  Id. (quoting State v. Pacific Guano Co., 22 S.C. 50 (1884)).  Here, the\r\ndeed and restrictions were drafted by DNR.  This case does not present the type of situation contemplated in Hardee that would justify reversing the usual rules\r\nof construction.  DNR asks this Court to read into a deed it drafted restrictions not \"created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication.\"  Taylor,\r\n332 S.C. at 5, 498 S.E.2d at 864.  We instead resolve all doubts \"in favor of the free use of property.\"  Id.        \r\n\r\nFinally, DNR suggests the town's reasons for enacting the ordinance are pretextual.  We disagree.  The town made extensive findings of fact concerning the\r\nneed for the present ordinance.  Even if the members of Town Council secretly harbor a hope that the permit fee will reduce the number of people who use the\r\nfacilities, this subjective desire would not invalidate an otherwise valid ordinance.  See Columbia Ry., Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Carter, 127 S.C. 473, 121 S.E. 377,\r\n379 (1924) (court cannot speculate as to motives of the Legislature); Pressley v. Lancaster County, Op. No. 3274 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1, p. 56) (S.C. Ct.\r\nApp. filed Jan. 2, 2001) (courts should not inquire into motivation behind a governmental body's decision on the use of land).  Moreover, the record does not\r\nsupport a finding the ordinance has had a chilling effect on public use of the facilities. \r\n\r\nDNR further suggests other means the town could employ to address the problems created by increased use of the facilities.  These arguments go to the wisdom\r\nof the legislation, and are irrelevant to the issue of the proper construction of the deed.  See&nbsp;Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 395, 134 S.E.2d 206,\r\n209 (1964) (responsibility for the wisdom of legislation rests with the Legislature).  DNR's argument concerning its offer of funds to upgrade the facilities is\r\nsimilarly misleading.  The availability of other means of funding is irrelevant to the issue of whether the town may impose a fee under the terms of the\r\nrestrictive covenant.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. It might be possible for the town to charge a fee so exorbitant or impose restrictions so unreasonable that the facilities are arguably no longer accessible or\r\navailable to the public.  However, in this case, we find the permit fee is reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25325","title":"State v.

Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Christopher Ramsey (\"Ramsey\") was found guilty of murder and kidnaping and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  He appeals\r\nhis sentence and conviction.  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background \r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Mobley (\"Mobley\") was the night cashier at the Flamingo video games parlor in the Liberty Hill section of Kershaw County, South Carolina.  On\r\nMarch 21, 1997, Richard Bowers (\"Bowers\"), a newspaper delivery person, discovered Mobley's dead body on Spring Rock Road as he was delivering the\r\nmorning paper.  Mobley had been brutally beaten and murdered. His throat was slashed from ear to ear with a serrated knife.  \r\n\r\nThe Flamingo is a tavern and video poker establishment located about a mile from where Bowers found Mobley's body.  Mobley was the sole employee of the\r\nFlamingo from midnight until 8:00 a.m., and the doors were locked between those hours.  He would only allow people he knew into the club between those\r\nhours.  Police investigators learned Mobley knew Ramsey, and probably would have let him in the Flamingo that night.  \r\n\r\nAt the crime scene, police investigators found signs of a struggle and footprint impressions.  The investigators also found a trail of blood stretching 244 feet\r\nfrom Mobley's body.  They took plaster casts of footprints and tire impressions found at the scene.   \r\n\r\nThere were several pieces of evidence linking  Ramsey to the crime.  First, police investigators found a striped sweater with blood on it near the crime scene. (1) \r\nOne of the hairs from the sweater was determined to be Mobley's.  Several witnesses identified Ramsey as wearing the striped sweater on the night of the\r\nmurder.   Tony Crolley testified he saw Ramsey driving in front of the Flamingo on the night of the murder wearing the striped sweater.  He also stated he\r\nthought Ramsey wore a striped shirt or sweater with overalls most of the time.  Truman Payne, who operated the Beaver Creek restaurant, testified Ramsey had\r\nbeen in the restaurant wearing a striped sweater on the night of the murder.  Melissa Payne, who was also working at the restaurant that night, corroborated her\r\nhusband's testimony concerning the sweater, and testified there \"is not no doubt in my mind\" Ramsey was wearing a striped sweater.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, investigators showed photographs of the sweater to other police officers.  Several police officers saw someone wearing the sweater at the Kershaw\r\nCounty Courthouse prior to the murder.  The investigators prepared a photographic lineup that included a picture of Ramsey.  Two officers, Deputies Patrick\r\nBoone and David Dowey, both identified Ramsey from the lineup as the person wearing the sweater several days before at the courthouse.  In fact, Deputy\r\nBoone knew Ramsey and had a conversation with him outside the courthouse when he was wearing the sweater.  \r\n\r\nThe second piece of evidence linking Ramsey to the crime was a bloody boot found by police investigators at Ramsey's trailer.  Although the pattern on the sole\r\nof the boots was similar to the cast taken from the crime scene, the boots were larger than the cast. (2)  Blood from the boot as well as the blood from the sweater\r\nwere sent to SLED for DNA testing.  SLED agents determined the blood on the sweater matched the DNA profile of Mobley.  The blood from the boot was\r\nforwarded to a lab in Tennessee for more testing.  \r\n\r\nMichael Deguglielmo (\"Deguglielmo\") from the Tennessee lab determined, through a polymerase chain reaction (\"PCR\") analysis, that the blood from the boot\r\ncontained a mixture of DNA from two people.  Deguglielmo testified the blood was not contaminated, it was simply a mixed sample.  He further stated that\r\nmixed samples are a reality of life in forensic testing.  Deguglielmo concluded he could not exclude Mobley as one of the persons whose blood was on the boot. \r\nBased on his testing, he determined the chance the DNA on the boot did not come from Mobley was one in 4,601 - a percentage greater than 99.9.  \r\n\r\nThe third piece of evidence linking Ramsey to the murder was the tire impressions taken from the crime scene.  Police investigators photographed the tires on\r\nRamsey's blue station wagon in order to compare them with the casts of the tire tracks from the crime scene.  The impressions and the tires appeared to be\r\nsimilar.  The tire tracks at the scene indicated the car was moving from the site where Mobley's body was discovered toward the site where the sweater was\r\ndiscovered.  Ramsey was seen in the blue station wagon on the night of the murder.  \r\n\r\nFinally, when police officers arrested Ramsey, they advised him of his Miranda rights, and he waived them verbally and by signing a Miranda waiver form.  As\r\nCaptain Tomley was transporting Ramsey to the Sheriff's Department, Ramsey stated, \"I guess you guys are going to be arresting Joey [Conners], because he\r\nwas with me that night.\"  \r\n\r\nRamsey was indicted by the Kershaw grand jury for the offenses of murder, kidnaping, and armed robbery.  On November 10, 1998, the jury found Ramsey\r\nguilty of murder and kidnaping, but acquitted him on the armed robbery charge.  The trial judge sentenced Ramsey to life imprisonment for murder but did not\r\nsentence him on the kidnaping charge pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (Supp. 2000).  The following issues are before this Court on appeal:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp; Did the trial judge err in refusing to conduct an in camera hearing regarding the suggestiveness of an out-of-court identification?\r\n  II.&nbsp; Did the trial judge abuse his discretion by admitting expert testimony that the blood on the boot from Ramsey's trailer matched the blood of the victim?\r\n  III.&nbsp; Did the trial judge properly deny Ramsey's motion for directed verdict?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; In Camera Hearing\r\n\r\nRelying on State v. Williams, 258 S.C. 482, 189 S.E.2d 299 (1972), Ramsey argues the trial judge erred by refusing to hold an in camera hearing to challenge\r\nthe suggestiveness of the photographic lineup identification made by Deputies Boone and Dowey.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  Where identification is concerned, the general rule is that a trial court must hold an in camera hearing when the State offers a witness whose testimony\r\nidentifies the defendant as the person who committed the crime, and the defendant challenges the in-court identification as being tainted by a previous, illegal\r\nidentification or confrontation.  State v. Cash, 257 S.C. 249, 185 S.E.2d 525 (1971). For example, in State v. Simmons, 308 S.C. 80, 417 S.E.2d 92 (1992), this\r\nCourt remanded the case for an in camera hearing where a witness saw a suspect at a bond hearing prior to his in-court identification of the suspect.  The\r\nwitness may have gotten a \"fix\" on the suspect at the bond hearing because the suspect's name was called and she came forward for the judge to set bond.  Id. \r\nAn in camera hearing was needed to determine whether the in-court identification was of independent origin or was the tainted product of the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the bond hearing.  Id.  The cases cited by Ramsey involve situations where an in-court identification is the product of an unlawful confrontation or\r\nlineup.  These cases, however, are immaterial because the issue in this case is simply whether an out-of-court photographic lineup was impermissibly\r\nsuggestive, not whether the subsequent in-court identification was tainted.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel did not object to the manner in which the photographs in the lineup were presented to the officers.  Ramsey's main concern is that after the\r\nsweater was discovered, and the police department identified him as a suspect, investigators asked the two officers whether they had seen anyone in the lineup\r\nwearing the striped sweater.   Deputy Boone was able to identify Ramsey with no problem.  Deputy Dowey, however,  recognized the sweater, but could not\r\nremember who he saw wearing it.  He remembered  Ramsey wore the sweater at the police station only after he saw the lineup.  Defense counsel maintains the\r\ntwo officers would naturally \"pick the big suspect in the big case for the Sheriff's Department at that time.\"  \r\n\r\nEven if the photographic lineup was impermissibly suggestive, any error in the trial court's refusal to conduct an in camera hearing was harmless.  See\r\nSimmons, supra (noting that under certain circumstances, if the identification is corroborated by either circumstantial or direct evidence, the harmless error rule\r\nis applicable).  Even without the deputies' testimony, the State had the testimony of three witnesses who testified they had \"no doubt\" Ramsey was wearing a\r\nstriped sweater on the day of the murder.  Ramsey did not challenge this testimony, which is actually more probative than the deputies' testimony.  Therefore,\r\neven if the admission of the deputies' testimony was erroneous, it was harmless error. \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; DNA Evidence\r\n\r\nRamsey argues the trial judge erred by admitting the \"contaminated\" DNA evidence from his boot.  Ramsey also contends the DNA evidence was unreliable\r\npursuant to Rule 702, SCRE.  We disagree.  This issue contains the following two distinct subparts: (1) whether the evidence was tainted and totally unreliable\r\npursuant to State v. Ford, 301 S.C. 485, 392 S.E.2d 781 (1990); and (2) whether Mr. Deguglielmo's expert testimony was based on unreliable scientific\r\nevidence which should be excluded pursuant to Rule 702, SCRE.\r\n\r\nA.  Tainted Evidence\r\n\r\nAccording to Ramsey, the police investigators mishandled all of the evidence in this case and committed \"classic violations of evidence preservation.\" \r\nSpecifically, pieces of evidence were taken from one crime scene to another.  For example, the blood evidence was taken from the murder scene, to the\r\nFlamingo, and finally to Ramsey's home.  The police investigators also took the striped sweater from the murder scene to the Flamingo where they removed\r\nhairs.  Finally, the bloody footprint casts were taken from the murder scene to Ramsey's home where they were washed.  According to Ramsey's expert\r\nwitness, Donald Girndt (\"Girndt\"), a former SLED agent and crime scene investigator, the blood on the boot could have been contaminated because the\r\nvictim's blood from the casts may have splashed onto the boot while they were being washed.  Girndt maintained the evidentiary value of the blood on the boot\r\nunder these circumstances was virtually zero.\r\n\r\nDNA evidence may be admitted in judicial proceedings in this State in the same manner as other scientific evidence, such as fingerprint analysis and blood\r\ntests.   Ford, supra.  However, the admissibility of DNA evidence remains subject to traditional attack, such as attacks based on relevancy or prejudice.  Id. \r\nAccording to this Court in Ford, \"traditional challenges to the admissibility of [DNA] evidence such as the contamination of the sample or chain of custody\r\nquestions may be presented.  These issues relate to the weight of the evidence.  The evidence may be found to be so tainted that it is totally unreliable and,\r\ntherefore, must be excluded.\" Id. at 490, 392 S.E.2d at 784.\r\n\r\nWe find the DNA evidence in this case is not so tainted that it is totally unreliable. Two conflicting theories were offered at trial as to how the evidence was\r\ncollected and its potential for contamination.  Ramsey maintains the blood on the boot could be contaminated, while the police officers testified they were\r\ncareful and complied with procedures.  We find these issues relate to the weight of the evidence.\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp; Admissibility Pursuant to Rule 702, SCRE\r\nThe proper standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence is outlined in Rule 702,\r\nSCRE. Pursuant to Rule 702, SCRE, in order for the evidence to be\r\nadmissible, the trial judge must find the scientific evidence will assist the trier of fact, the expert witness is qualified, and the underlying science is reliable. (3) \r\nThe trial judge should determine the reliability of the underlying science by using the following factors: (1) the publication of peer review of the technique; (2)\r\nprior application of the method to the type of evidence involved in the case; (3) the quality control procedures used to ensure reliability; and (4) the consistency\r\nof the method with recognized scientific laws and procedures.  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999).  Further, even if the evidence is admissible\r\nunder Rule 702, SCRE, the trial judge must determine if its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect under Rule 403, SCRE.  Once the evidence is\r\nadmitted under these standards, the jury may give it such weight as it deems appropriate.  Id.\r\nRamsey does not challenge the evidence based on any of the Council factors.  Most importantly, he does not challenge the qualifications of the State's expert,\r\nDeguglielmo, or the reliability of the PCR procedure.  He challenges only the means in which the police officers handled the evidence prior to the testing\r\nconducted by Deguglielmo.\r\n\r\nThe issue is whether Deguglielmo's expert testimony regarding the DNA evidence was unreliable pursuant to Rule 702, SCRE and, therefore, inadmissible. \r\nThis Court reviews the admission of such testimony under an abuse of discretion standard.  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998).\r\n\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting Deguglielmo's expert testimony.  First, Ramsey does not challenge the PCR procedure used by\r\nDeguglielmo to test the DNA samples.  Even if the samples were mixed during collection, Ramsey does not demonstrate Deguglielmo's testing procedure was\r\nunreliable, much less so unreliable as to warrant exclusion.  Second, the testimony concerning the DNA evidence complied with the requirements as set forth in\r\nCouncil.  Any evidence concerning contamination, therefore, went to the weight of the testimony, not its admissibility.  Finally, the mixture of DNA evidence is\r\nnot a basis for the exclusion of PCR evidence.  See Oregon v. Lyons, 863 P.2d 1303 (Or. Ct. App. 1993) (finding the potential for DNA contamination presents\r\nan \"open field\" for cross examination at trial, but does not indicate the PCR method of DNA testing is inappropriate for forensic use).  According to\r\nDeguglielmo, mixed samples are simply a fact of life in forensic science.\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Directed Verdict \r\n\r\nRamsey argues the trial judge should have directed a verdict of acquittal because the DNA evidence should have been excluded. (4)  Because we find the DNA\r\nevidence was admissible, it is unnecessary for us to address Ramsey's directed verdict motion.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, Ramsey's sentence and convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. The sweater is a distinctive gray, brown, and beige horizontally striped sweater.\r\n2. Evidence was presented which indicated two people murdered Mobley.  Ramsey was seen on the night of the murder with his roommate Joey \"Clown\"\r\nConnors.  \r\n3. Rule 702, SCRE, states:\r\n\r\nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified\r\nas an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\r\n4. A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.  State v. Brown, 103 S.C. 437, 88 S.E. 21(1916). \r\nIf there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilty of the accused, the Court must find the case was\r\nproperly submitted to the jury.

Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d 526 (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25326","title":"Sea PinesAssociation for the Protection of Wildlife, Inc. v.

The South \r\n  Carolina General Assembly established Sea Pines as one of eleven wildlife sanctuaries \r\n  designated under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-880(1) (Supp. 2000). Sea Pines provides \r\n  habitat for numerous species of wildlife, including the white-tailed deer. \r\n\r\nMany Sea Pines residents enjoy observing, interacting, \r\n  and photographing the deer and other wildlife in the sanctuary. However, over \r\n  the past several years, many residents and homeowners have become concerned \r\n  with the growing number of deer. Residents of Sea Pines have complained about \r\n  landscape damage, increased number of automobile collisions \r\n  (1), and more frequent confrontations between deer and humans. In \r\n  response, Community Service Associates, Inc. (\"CSA\") (2) \r\n  embarked on a program designed to study the deer population. CSA hired both \r\n  Todd Ballentine, a local naturalist, and also Dr. Robert Warren, a professor \r\n  of Wildlife Ecology and Management at the University of Georgia School of Forest \r\n  Resources, to conduct a study of the deer population problem. \r\n\r\nDr. Warren conducted an in-depth scientific analysis of the deer herd in Sea Pines.  In conjunction with Dr. Warren's studies,\r\nsix public meetings were held, the residents were surveyed, and two Master's theses were written.  At the conclusion of his\r\nresearch, Dr. Warren issued a comprehensive report and a Project Proposal on May 14, 1998, which served as a basis for the\r\nissuance of the permits in this case.  Pursuant to the Project Proposal, a scientific study would commence in July 1998, and\r\ncontinue into the year 2000.  At the conclusion of the study, lethal techniques would be used to remove 100 to 200 deer, or\r\napproximately fifty percent of the herd, in the southern portion of Sea Pines where the concentration of deer was the greatest.    \r\n\r\nAppellants oppose the lethal reduction of the population of white-tailed deer.  The lead Appellant, Sea Pines Association for\r\nthe Protection of Wildlife, Inc. (\"SPAPW\"), an organization of Sea Pines residents or property owners, was formed for the\r\nspecific purpose of promoting the use of non-lethal means of resolving conflicts between humans and wildlife.  On August 25,\r\n1998, Appellants filed a Summons and Complaint seeking:  (1) a temporary retraining order to restrain the Department from\r\nissuing any further permits for the taking or killing of deer within Sea Pines and to restrain CSA and the University of Georgia\r\nfrom acting on any existing permits; (2) a temporary injunction and permanent injunction against the issuance of permits by the\r\nDepartment to CSA without meeting the requirements of section 50-11-880; and (3) a declaratory judgment determining\r\nwhether the Department complied with the requisite statutes, rules, and regulations relative to the issuance of permits in a\r\nwildlife sanctuary, and whether the Department violated the constitutional rights of the residents of Sea Pines by failing to\r\nafford them due process.   \r\n\r\nOn September 10, 1998, the trial court denied Appellant's Motion for a Temporary Injunction.  Appellants then filed a Petition\r\nfor a Writ of Supersedeas with the South Carolina Court of Appeals.  In a panel hearing on September 23, 1998, the Court of\r\nAppeals granted Appellant's petition, which reinstated the temporary restraining order until the trial of the case.  On November\r\n20, 1998, the Court of Appeals issued an order holding the appeal in abeyance pending the outcome of a trial on the merits of\r\nthe case. \r\n\r\nA non-jury trial was held from March 15, 1999 to March 17, 1999, where the trial judge vacated the temporary injunction and\r\ndismissed the action with prejudice, holding: (1) Appellants lacked standing to pursue the matters alleged in the Complaint; (2)\r\nthere are no statutory or constitutional due process requirements for notice or opportunity to be heard concerning the issuance\r\nof the permits; and (3) the actions of the Department in the issuance of these permits has been in total compliance with the\r\nstatutory laws of this State.\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 1999, the Department issued a permit to CSA and the University of Georgia to collect up to ten male white-tailed\r\ndeer for a herd health check.  On July 13, 1999, the Department issued a permit to CSA and the University of Georgia for the\r\nremoval of up to one hundred deer in Sea Pines during the period between September 15, 1999 and January 1, 1999. \r\nAppellants filed a Petition for a Writ of Supersedeas with the trial court to prevent CSA or any of its agents from acting on the\r\nlatter permit, which was denied.  Appellants filed another Writ of Supersedeas with the Court of Appeals challenging the latter\r\npermit, which was granted by order dated September 3, 1999.  \r\n\r\nOn November 24, 1999, CSA file a Motion for Emergency Protection of the Public Health and Safety of Sea Pines Residents\r\nand Visitors.  The Court of Appeals issued an order denying the Motion, but it noted the stayed  permit expired on January 1,\r\n2000, and there was nothing to prevent CSA from requesting another permit.  The Department issued a permit to CSA to\r\nremove up to two hundred deer from Sea Pines on January 11, 2000.  Appellants filed a separate suit on January 13, 2000, and\r\nrequested a temporary restraining order that the trial court denied.  The Court of Appeals issued an oral Writ of Supersedeas in\r\nthis matter.  \r\n\r\nOn March 13, 2000, this Court granted Appellant's Motion to Certify Case for Review.  The following issues are before this\r\nCourt on appeal:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Do Appellants have standing to challenge the Department's issuance of permits for the lethal elimination of deer in the Sea\r\nPines' wildlife sanctuary?\r\n\r\nII.     Do Appellants, and other affected persons or organizations, have a right to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to\r\nthe Department's issuance of permits for the lethal elimination of deer in the Sea Pines' wildlife sanctuary?\r\n\r\nIII.    Did the Department properly issue permits for the lethal elimination of deer in the Sea Pines' wildlife sanctuary by\r\nmaking proper factual and legal determinations under section 50-11-880 that the deer, due to size, disease, or other\r\nextraordinary factors, posed a threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or to itself, or other species in or around the\r\nsanctuary?\r\n\r\nIV.   Did the Department properly issue permits under section 50-11-1050 and section 50-11-1090 for the taking of deer in a\r\nwildlife sanctuary?  \r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Standing\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erroneously determined they do not have standing.  The trial court reasoned that because the\r\ndeer are the property of the State of South Carolina and not its individual residents, Appellants do not have standing because\r\nthey cannot allege a particularized harm as a result of the deer's termination.  We agree with the trial court's ruling. \r\n\r\nTo have standing, one must have a personal stake in the subject matter of the lawsuit.  In other words, one must be a real party\r\nin interest.  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Election Comm'n, 336 S.C. 174, 519 S.E.2d 567 (1999).  \"A\r\nreal party in interest is one who has a real, material, or substantial interest in the subject matter of the action, as opposed to one\r\nwho has only a nominal or technical interest in the action.\"  Id. at 181, 519 S.E.2d at 571 (quoting Anchor Point, Inc. v. Shoals\r\nSewer Co., 308 S.C. 422, 428, 418 S.E.2d 546, 549 (1992)).  A private person does not have standing unless he has sustained,\r\nor is in immediate danger of sustaining, prejudice from an executive or legislative action.  Baird v. Charleston County, 333\r\nS.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999).  Such imminent prejudice must be of a personal nature to the party laying claim to standing\r\nand not merely of general interest common to all members of the public.  Id. (citing Citizens for Lee County, Inc. v. Lee County,\r\n308 S.C. 23, 416 S.E.2d 641 (1992)).  When an organization is involved, the organization has standing on behalf of its\r\nmembers if one or more of its members will suffer an individual injury by virtue of the contested act.  Sierra Club v. Morton,\r\n405 U.S. 727, 92 S. Ct. 1361, 31 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1972). \r\n\r\nIn Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992), the United States Supreme Court\r\nenunciated a stringent standing test.  Lujan set forth the \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,\" which consists of the\r\nfollowing three elements:\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an 'injury in fact' - an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and\r\nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical'.  Second, there must be a causal connection\r\nbetween the injury and the conduct complained of - the injury has to be \"fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the\r\ndefendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\"  Third, it must be\r\n'likely,' as opposed to merely 'speculative,' that the injury will be 'redressed by a favorable decision.'\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 559-61, 112 S. Ct. at 2136 (internal citations omitted); see also Beaufort Realty Co. v. S.C. Coastal Conservation League,\r\nOp. No. 3360 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 25, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 23 at 80).  The party seeking to establish standing\r\ncarries the burden of demonstrating each of the three elements.  Id. at 561, 112 S. Ct. at 2136-37.\r\n\r\nThe first element requires the plaintiff to suffer an injury in fact, or a particularized harm.  The Department argues that an\r\naesthetic interest in wildlife is not a legally protected interest because under South Carolina law there is no protected interest in\r\nan individual wild animal, until that animal is reduced to possession.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-10 (Supp. 2000) (\"All wild\r\nbirds, wild game, and fish, . . . are the property of the State.\").  According to the United States Supreme Court, \"The desire to\r\nuse or observe an animal species, even for purely esthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for the purpose of\r\nstanding.\"  Id. at 562, 112 S. Ct. at 2137. (3)  Furthermore, South Carolina case law has specifically recognized an injury to one's\r\naesthetic and recreational interests in enjoying and observing wildlife is a judicially cognizable injury in fact.  See S.C. Wildilife\r\nFed'n v. S.C. Coastal Council, 296 S.C. 187, 371 S.E.2d 521 (1988) (holding environmental groups and League of Women\r\nVoters had standing because they suffered injuries as a result of decisions by the Coastal Council which affected the members'\r\nuse and enjoyment of the fish and wildlife of the wetlands);  Ogburn-Matthews v. Loblolly Partners (Ricefields Subdivision),\r\n332 S.C. 551, 505 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding property owners adjacent to wetlands had standing to challenge the\r\nissuance of a permit to fill the wetlands because the permit would adversely affect the property owners' use and enjoyment of\r\nthe wetlands). \r\n\r\nNonetheless, according to Lujan, the Appellant's injury has to be actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.  In order\r\nfor the injury to be \"particularized,\" it must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.\r\nCt. at 2136; see also Beaufort Realty, supra (finding one must suffer an actual injury in fact, not a prospective concern of \r\nfuture harm, in order to satisfy the Lujan test).  Appellants presented no evidence their opportunity to view and enjoy the deer\r\nwould be diminished by the permits.  The Appellant's injury is conjectural because it is not certain that reducing the size of the\r\nherd would decrease the number of deer actually viewed by the residents each day.  Because deer population growth has\r\nremained constant on Sea Pines, the deer population decrease proposed by the Department may have little or no effect on the\r\nresidents' ability to enjoy the deer.  \r\n\r\nEven if we assume Appellants have alleged a particularized harm,  Appellants failed to present evidence the injury would be\r\nredressed by a favorable decision in this case.  As the trial judge noted in his order, the goal of the Appellant's plan was to\r\nreduce the size of the deer herd.  According to  Gordon Stamler, the lead Appellant, their plan was to first use all necessary\r\nnon-lethal means to reduce the deer population, including educational pamphlets, education of wildlife officers, using roadside\r\nreflectors, enforcing the speed limits, and electric fencing.  If, after using these non-lethal means, the Department determines\r\npursuant to section 50-11-880 that the deer herd needs to be reduced due to health or safety concerns, the Department would\r\nuse immunocontraception, a form of birth control.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the alleged injury would be redressed by a\r\nfavorable decision in this case because the Appellant's immunocontraception plan would cause the same injury - a reduction in\r\nthe population of deer in Sea Pines.           \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although Appellants have an aesthetic interest in Sea Pines' deer and the environment, they are denied standing\r\nbecause they failed to satisfy the three-pronged Lujan test.  Because we find Appellants lack standing, we decline to address the\r\ndue process issue.\r\n\r\nII.    The Permits\r\n\r\n  Appellants argue the trial court erred in determining the Department complied with section 50-11-880 when it issued permits\r\nto kill deer in Sea Pines based on the presence of disease, overpopulation, and the number of deer/vehicle collisions. \r\nAppellants also argue the trial court erred in determining the Department may issue permits for the taking and killing of\r\nanimals in a wildlife sanctuary under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-1050 and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-1090.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThis Court reviews the Department's permitting decisions pursuant to the standard articulated in the Administrative Procedures\r\nAct (\"APA\").  The findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by\r\nsubstantial evidence.  Kearse v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 318 S.C. 198, 456 S.E.2d 892 (1995).  Under the\r\nsubstantial evidence rule, a reviewing court will not overturn a finding of fact by an administrative agency \"unless there is no\r\nreasonable probability that the facts could be as related by a witness upon whose testimony the finding was based.\"  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981) (citations omitted).  Thus, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of an\r\nagency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, unless the agency's finding are clearly erroneous in view of the\r\nreliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 466 S.E.2d 357\r\n(1996).  Substantial evidence is evidence which would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative\r\nagency reached in order to justify its action.  See Miller by Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 441 S.E.2d 323 (1994). \r\n\r\nIn section 50-11-880, the General Assembly designated eleven specific areas of the state as wildlife sanctuaries and provided\r\nthat, within these areas, it is unlawful to \"attempt to take or kill any wildlife.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-880 (Supp. 2000).  The\r\nstatute further directs the Department to monitor these sanctuaries and assigns to the agency the following discretionary rights:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the department determines that, due to size, disease, or other extraordinary factors, a particular population of a species\r\nlocated in, on, or around a sanctuary described above constitutes a threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the public or to\r\nitself, or other species in, on, or around the sanctuary, it may authorize the taking of a sufficient number of species to reduce or\r\neliminate the threat.  The wildlife must be taken by department personnel or other persons acting under their supervision and\r\nthe authorization for the taking limits the number of animals taken and the days, times, and methods to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-880 (emphasis added).  \r\n\r\nWe find the Department did not act ultra vires when it issued the permits in this case because there is substantial evidence in\r\nthe record to support the Department's determination that the increase in the size of the deer population, the increase in\r\ndeer/vehicle collisions, and the potential spread of  Ehrlichiosis (4)\r\n by the deer (5)constitutes a threat to the health, safety, and\r\nwelfare of the public.\r\n\r\nTo refute the evidence presented by the Department, the Appellants relied on the testimony of their expert, Dr. Allen Rutberg, a\r\nsenior scientist with the Humane Society of the United States.  Dr. Rutberg testified that the deer population of Sea Pines was\r\nhealthy and there is \"no evidence . . . that the size of the deer population is in any way a threat to the deer.\"  He also testified\r\nthat he saw no justification for using lethal means to eliminate the deer at this time.  However, he admitted he saw no evidence\r\non the issue of deer population growth.  He stated \"I've seen no evidence at all that the population of deer at Sea Pines is\r\ngrowing or not growing.\"  Dr. Rutberg's testimony does not discredit the findings of the Department because the health of the\r\ndeer has nothing to do with the fact the deer population is growing at a rapid rate, dramatically increasing the number of\r\ndeer/vehicle collisions in Sea Pines.  \r\n\r\nBetween May 1998 and March 1999, the deer herd on Sea Pines increased by one hundred animals, from five hundred to six\r\nhundred. As set forth in the accident reports compiled by CSA security, there were 43 reported collisions in 1998, 29 in 1997,\r\n39 in 1996, 33 in 1995, 40 in 1994, and 18 in 1993.  Thus, the average of reported deer/vehicle collisions from 1993 to 1998 is\r\n33.6 collisions per year.  Charles Ray Ruth, the statewide deer project supervisor for the Department, stated that the\r\ndeer/vehicle collision rate in Sea Pines is eight times the rate in the remainder of the State. (6)  According to Mr. Ruth, the size of\r\nthe deer population poses a health threat to other deer and to the public through increased vehicle collisions.  Mr. Ruth's\r\ntestimony and the other evidence of deer/vehicle collisions on Sea Pines provides substantial evidence to support the\r\nDepartment's holding that the size of the deer population poses a definite threat to the health and safety of Sea Pines' residents.\r\n\r\nAppellants also contend the Department has improperly issued permits for the taking of deer in Sea Pines under the auspices of\r\nstatutes other than section 50-11-880.  Specifically, the Appellants argue that sections 50-11-1050, 1090, and 1180 do not give\r\nthe Department the authority to issue permits for the taking of deer in a wildlife sanctuary.  However, wildlife sanctuaries are\r\nnot specifically excluded from these statutes.  Furthermore, section 50-11-880 is not a permitting statute.  Once the Department\r\nmakes a determination under section 50-11-880, another statute must be applied to issue the permits.  Mr. Ruth, the\r\nDepartment's statewide deer project supervisor, was aware of the specific differences between the various sections, he\r\nexplained during his testimony the basis and justification for each permit issued, and why he issued each permit pursuant to\r\nonly certain code sections.     \r\n\r\n     Conclusion\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the trial court's order as modified, holding the Appellants do not have standing under \r\nLujan,  and the Department's issuance of permits for the lethal elimination of deer on Sea Pines was in compliance with the\r\nlaws of this State.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Mr. William Bloom, a statistician with the South Carolina Department of Public Safety, concluded that motorists within Sea\r\nPines were 6.5 times more likely to have a deer/vehicle collision than motorists in South Carolina generally.  \r\n2. CSA is an association of \r\n  property owners in Sea Pines formed to hold and manage the common property in \r\n  Sea Pines and to provide security. All Sea Pines property owners are mandatory, \r\n  dues-paying members of CSA. \r\n 3.  See \r\n  also Sierra Club, supra (\"Aesthetic \r\n  and environmental well-being like economic well-being, are important ingredients \r\n  of the quality of life in our society, and the fact that particular environmental \r\n  interests are shared by the many rather than the few does not make them less \r\n  deserving of legal protection through the judicial process.\"); Japan Whaling \r\n  Ass'n v. American Cetacean Soc'y,  478 U.S. 221, 106 S. Ct. 2860, 92 L. \r\n  Ed. 2d 166 (1986) (holding plaintiffs alleged a sufficient injury in fact because \r\n  whale watching and studying of their members will be adversely affected by continued \r\n  whale harvesting). \r\n 4.  Ehrlichiosis \r\n   is a bacterial disease spread \r\n  by infected ticks. Most infections are mild and can be treated with antibiotics. \r\n  Severely ill patients can develop abnormally low numbers of white blood cells, \r\n  abnormally low numbers of platelets, or kidney failure. The risk of severe illness \r\n  and complications is highest in the elderly. \r\n5.  Dr. \r\n  Warren testified that the deer herd on Sea Pines may pose a threat to the public \r\n  because the herd health surveys show that there is a very high incidence of \r\n   Ehrlichiosis.  He states that the fatality rates for both types of \r\n  Ehrlichiosis  infections in humans is relative high, especially in \r\n  elderly people. Dr. Warren would not agree that there is no unique health risk \r\n  associated with  Ehrlichiosis  because one hundred percent of the deer \r\n  he examined had been exposed to  Ehrlichiosis. \r\n6.  It \r\n  is unclear whether this is the accurate rate of deer/vehicle collisions. In \r\n  other sections of the record and in the briefs, the deer/vehicle collision rate \r\n  is quoted as 6, 6.5, and 7 times greater on Sea Pines than in other parts of \r\n  South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25327","title":"In the Matter of Michael A.

Condon and Assistant Deputy Attorney General J. Emory Smith, Jr., both of Columbia, for the\r\nOffice of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\nCharles J. Hodge and Thomas B. Cabler, both of Spartanburg, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   \r\n  In this attorney discipline matter, the panel recommends the Court indefinitely \r\n  suspend Michael A. Devine (\"Devine\") from the practice of law to run from the \r\n  date of his interim suspension on March 19, 1998 . The panel further recommends \r\n  the Court require Devine to meet the following requirements before he is re-admitted: \r\n  (1) attend a South Carolina Bar approved CLE program on office management; (2) \r\n  provide satisfactory evidence of substance abuse counseling and treatment for \r\n  the last twelve months; (3) file with the Clerk of the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court medical statements certifying his emotional and medical ability to practice \r\n  law; and (4) make full restitution to the Client Security Fund for all sums \r\n  paid to victims, or to the victim if not paid by the Client Security Fund, in \r\n  the amounts set forth herein. We concur and impose the recommended sanction. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    Factual/Procedural Background \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nDevine is a resident of Spartanburg County. On \r\n  March 19, 1998, this Court placed him on interim suspension from the practice \r\n  of law. In re Devine, 330 S.C. 36, 486 S.E.2d 870 (1998). The Court \r\n  appointed William U. Gunn, Esq. to assume responsibility for Devine's client \r\n  files, trust accounts, escrow accounts, operating accounts, and other law firm \r\n  accounts. Id. Devine stipulated to the following facts.\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Boswell Matter\r\n\r\nDevine held $10,312.98 in trust for Christopher \r\n  Boswell (\"Boswell\"). This sum represented the amount of money Boswell received \r\n  from his father's estate. Boswell paid Devine $5,000 of these funds to represent \r\n  him on the following three sets of criminal charges: (1) receiving stolen goods; \r\n  (2) burglary; and (3) DUI 3rd, leaving the scene of an accident, and no seatbelt. \r\n  Devine was then suspended. Boswell worked out the stolen goods and burglary \r\n  charges with the Solicitor without the aid of an attorney. Boswell hired another \r\n  attorney to handle the DUI and other related charges. \r\n\r\nPrior to his suspension, Devine accepted another \r\n  potential criminal matter for Boswell concerning a possible arson charge. Boswell \r\n  agreed that $3,000 of the money from his father's estate could be used by Devine \r\n  if he was ever charged with arson. Boswell was never charged, and Devine retained \r\n  the $3,000.\r\n\r\nThe Client Security Fund paid Boswell $10,012.98 \r\n  of his total claim of $11,012.98. Devine stipulates he misadvised Boswell concerning \r\n  these matters. According to Devine, during this period he was experiencing multiple \r\n  personal problems, including a divorce and a controlled substance abuse problem. \r\n  He claims he has received counseling for these problems and believes he has \r\n  them under control. \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Other Cases  \r\n\r\n\r\nDevine stipulates he received $16,015 in attorney's \r\n  fees from clients when he did little or no work to earn these fees. He agrees \r\n  that each of the following clients should receive a refund of their fees: Terry \r\n  Bent Thomas, $1,750; Horace Steven Wall, $500; Lori Bright, $500; Robert Hammett, \r\n  $2,070; Samuel Hutchins, $505; Woodson Keller, II, $5,000; Kenneth and Helen \r\n  Gosnell, $200; Angela Nelson, $1,500; Charles and Gladys Murphy, $650; Diane \r\n  Huey, $570; John Newman, $2,470; and Christina Lambert, $300. \r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Other Stipulations \r\nDevine also stipulates to the following facts: \r\n  (1) his trust account reflected negative balances and charges and overdrafts \r\n  in 1996, 1997, and 1998; (2) he misadvised clients as to the status of their \r\n  cases; (3) he misrepresented to a circuit court that a client wanted to withdraw \r\n  an appeal from a magistrate's court decision when the client actually wanted \r\n  to appeal; (4) he failed to appear in court for scheduled hearings; (5) he failed \r\n  to communicate with numerous clients, including failing to return phone calls; \r\n  (6) he at times operated without a license and kept his office closed without \r\n  notification to clients on how to reach him; and (7) he failed to respond to \r\n  communications from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, including letters requesting \r\n  responses to complaints and notices of full investigation. \r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1999, Devine was served with a Notice \r\n  of Filing of Formal Charges and Formal Charges in this matter. Devine filed \r\n  an Answer on July 26, 1999.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 1999, a hearing was held before \r\n  the sub panel. Devine and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel entered into two \r\n  sets of Stipulations. The parties also agreed to receive into evidence a report \r\n  of the payments made by the Client Security Fund in response to Devine's claims. \r\n  On January 9, 2001, the full panel adopted the sub panel's report, which recommended \r\n  an indefinite suspension. Neither party filed exceptions or briefs in response \r\n  to the panel's report. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Discussion  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner \r\n  in which the discipline is given rests entirely with this Court. In re Yarborough, \r\n  337 S.C. 245, 524 S.E.2d 100 (1999). Although this Court is not, in an attorney \r\n  disciplinary proceeding, bound by the findings made by the panel or by the Commission \r\n  itself, these findings are entitled to great weight. Id. This Court \r\n  may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law in an attorney disciplinary \r\n  proceeding. Id. Furthermore, an attorney disciplinary violation must \r\n  be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Id.\r\n\r\nRegarding all matters, the panel found Devine breached several Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and Rules\r\nfor Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.  The panel found violations of the following rules: (1) Rule 1.15,\r\nRule 407, SCACR, misappropriating client funds; (2) Rule 1.15, failing to deliver funds to a client or third person; (3) Rule\r\n1.15, failing to render promptly a full accounting regarding property of the client or third person; (4) Rule 8.4(d), engaging in\r\nconduct involving dishonesty, deceit, and misrepresentation; (5) Rule 8.4(b), committing a criminal act that reflects adversely\r\non a lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer; (6) Rule 4.1(a), making a false statement of material fact or law\r\nto a third person; (7) Rule 3.3 (a)(1), making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; (8) Rule 1.3, failing to act\r\nwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client; (9) Rule 1.4(a), failing to keep clients reasonably informed\r\nand responding promptly with requests for information; (10) Rule 1.1, failing to represent clients competently; (11) Rule\r\n8.1(b), failing to cooperate with disciplinary investigations; (12) Rule 8.4(a), violating the Rules of Professional Conduct; (13)\r\nRule 8.4(e), engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; (14) Rule 413, engaging in conduct tending to\r\npollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or legal profession into disrepute; (15) Rule 413, engaging in conduct\r\ndemonstrating unfitness to practice law; and (16) Rule 417, SCACR, failing to maintain appropriate financial records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on Devine's rehabilitation and the panel's \r\n  recommendation, we indefinitely suspend Devine from the practice of law. The \r\n  commencement point for this suspension will be the date of Devine's interim \r\n  suspension, March 19, 1998. In addition to the requirements of Rule 33(f), Rule \r\n  413, SCACR, Devine must meet the following requirements before he can be re-admitted \r\n  to the practice of law: (1) attend a South Carolina Bar approved CLE program \r\n  on office management; (2) provide satisfactory evidence of substance abuse counseling \r\n  and treatment for the last twelve months; (3) file with the Clerk of the South \r\n  Carolina Supreme Court medical statements certifying his emotional and medical \r\n  ability to practice law; and (4) make full restitution to the Client Security \r\n  Fund for all sums paid to victims, or to the victim if not paid by the Client \r\n  Security Fund, in the amounts set forth herein. Furthermore, we find Devine \r\n  responsible for $302.86, the costs incurred by the Commission in this matter. \r\n  Devine shall file, within fifteen days of this opinion, an affidavit with the \r\n  clerk of this Court stating he has complied with Paragraph 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25328","title":"In the Matter of Gerald P.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension of sixty\r\ndays.  We accept the agreement and hereby suspend respondent.  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows. \r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nOn two occasions, respondent allowed a paralegal to close a real estate transaction in his absence.  In both cases, respondent's clients were charged an appraisal\r\nfee that exceeded the amount charged by the appraiser. \r\n\r\nIn a third matter, several checks drawn on respondent's trust account were dishonored due to insufficient funds.  Although the lack of funds was caused by an\r\ninadequate wire transfer, respondent failed to use diligent accounting practices that would have detected this problem sooner. \r\n\r\nIn a fourth matter, respondent withheld $4,019.50 from the sale of real estate to satisfy a lien against the property.  Although the sellers later negotiated a\r\nreduction in the lien, respondent failed to reply to their inquiries regarding disbursement.  Respondent eventually disbursed the full amount to the lienholder,\r\ndespite having been notified that the amount of the lien had been reduced. \r\n\r\nIn a fifth matter, respondent delayed a real estate closing without communicating the reason for the delay to the client.  Respondent caused further delays by\r\nfailing to ensure that the closing statement was correct.  Respondent also failed to ensure that his client's homeowners' policy was paid and failed to provide the\r\nclient with the deed or the completed HUD statement in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIn a sixth matter, respondent failed to file a lawsuit until two years after he was retained, despite the fact that his client had collected a significant amount of\r\nevidence.  Respondent eventually filed the suit in the wrong forum, causing additional delays.  Respondent failed to respond to his client's phone calls about\r\nthis matter. \r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that his conduct violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (failing to provide competent\r\nrepresentation); Rule 1.3 (failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness while representing a client); Rule 1.4(a) (failing to keep a client reasonably\r\ninformed about the status of a matter and failing to promptly respond to reasonable requests for information); Rule 2.1 (failing to properly serve as an advisor to\r\na client); Rule 3.2 (failing to properly expedite litigation consistent with the interests of a client); Rule 5.3 (failing to properly execute responsibilities regarding\r\nnonlawyer assistants); Rule 5.5 (assisting other persons in the unauthorized practice of law); and Rule 8.4 (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct).  \r\n\r\nRespondent also admits that he violated Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct), and Rule 417, SCACR\r\n(requirements of financial recordkeeping).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe find that respondent's misconduct warrants a definite suspension.  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and hereby suspend\r\nrespondent from the practice of law for sixty days.\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25329","title":"In the Matter of Walter Bilbro, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25329","description":"Opinion publicly reprimanding Walter Bilbro, Jr.","date":"2001-07-23","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       In the Matter of Walter Bilbro, \r\n        Jr., Respondent.  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25329\r\n  Submitted June 12, 2001 - Filed July 23, 2001\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    PUBLIC REPRIMAND \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B.

We accept the agreement. \r\nThe facts as stated in the agreement are as follows. \r\n  Respondent undertook representation of a client in a workers' compensation matter \r\n  when he had previously, and was currently, representing the client's employer. \r\n  Respondent did not fully disclose the conflict to the client nor did he obtain \r\n  the client's consent to continue representation despite the conflict. Respondent \r\n  also gave the client advice with respect to the workers' compensation claim \r\n  without having conducted an adequate factual and legal investigation of the \r\n  claim.\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (failing \r\n  to provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (failing to act with \r\n  reasonable diligence in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (failing to properly \r\n  communicate with a client); and Rule 1.7 (representing a client when representation \r\n  of the client is directly adverse to another client). By violating the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct, respondent has also violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules \r\n  for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nWe find the facts as set forth in the agreement \r\n  warrant a public reprimand. Accordingly, we hereby publicly reprimand respondent \r\n  for his conduct.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25330","title":"State v.

Chasnoff, M.D. \r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Appellant appeals her guilty plea for violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n20-7-50 (Supp. 1995).  She attempts to raise a number of constitutional\r\nchallenges to this Court's decision in Whitner v. State, 328 S.C.1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997), and alleges the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept\r\nher plea.  Because her guilty plea was a nullity, we decline to address the issues raised, and we vacate her plea and sentence.     \r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nAfter giving birth to a stillborn child, Brenda Peppers (\"Peppers\") was charged with violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-50 (Supp. 1995). (1)\r\n\r\nPrior to entering her guilty plea, Peppers made a motion to quash the indictment.  Her attorney made the following objection:\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge, there's one matter that the defense has before you take the plea.  Realizing that this court is bound by the case of State v. Whitner, [sic] which the court\r\nis very familiar with, and under the principles set forth in Blackledge v. Perry, [417 U.S. 21, 94 S. Ct. 2098 (1974)] a U.S. Supreme Court case which allows a\r\n[sic] to make a motion to quash an indictment if the motion to quash would end the case and preserve the issues for future review, I would move to quash the\r\nindictment . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nCounsel proceeded to argue that the indictment violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article I, Section X of the South Carolina\r\nConstitution, and \"the principles of Roe v. Wade.\"  He further argued that the indictment was unconstitutional in that the term \"viability,\" as used in the\r\nindictment, was vague such that a person of \"common knowledge\" would be unable to determine the point at which viability is attained.  Finally, he moved to\r\nquash the arrest warrant on the grounds that Section 20-7-50 did not provide adequate notice of the conduct it prohibited.   The trial court denied all motions,\r\nwhile assuring defense counsel that Peppers was \"protected\" on the record, and accepted Peppers' guilty plea.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was error for the trial court to accept Peppers' conditional plea.  In State v. O'Leary, 302 S.C. 17, 393 S.E.2d 186 (1990), the trial court accepted the\r\ndefendant's plea of guilty to the offense of driving under suspension (\"DUS\"), conditioned, however, upon the defendant's right to appeal his constitutional\r\nchallenges of the DUS statute.  This Court held that\r\n\r\n[g]uilty pleas are unconditional and, if an accused attempts to attach any condition, the trial Court must direct a plea of not guilty. . . .  It is, thus, impermissible\r\nfor a defendant to preserve constitutional issues while entertaining a guilty plea; the trial Court may not accept the plea on such terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 18, 393 S.E.2d at 187 (internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Truesdale, 278 S.C. 368, 296 S.E.2d 528 (1982), the Court reversed the defendant's conviction which followed his conditional guilty plea.  The\r\nCourt stated that the entrance of a conditional guilty plea\r\n\r\n\r\nis a practice not recognized in South Carolina and a practice which we expressly disapprove.  Pleas of guilty are unconditional, and if an accused attempts to\r\nattach any condition or qualification thereto, the trial court should direct a plea of not guilty. . . .  The basis for this rule is, of course, the settled doctrine that a\r\nguilty plea constitutes waiver of all prior claims of constitutional rights or deprivations thereof. . . .  It was thus improper for appellant to seek to preserve the\r\nconstitutional issues enumerated above while entering pleas of guilty.  It was error of the trial court to accept the pleas on such terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 370, 296 S.E.2d at 529 (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\nWe do not construe the holding of Blackledge v. Perry, supra, as broadly as Peppers.  Perry was an inmate in North Carolina's correctional system.  While\r\nincarcerated, he allegedly attacked a fellow inmate with a weapon, and was charged with the misdemeanor offense of assault with a deadly weapon.  Under\r\nNorth Carolina law, the District Court Division of the General Court of Justice had exclusive jurisdiction for the trial of all misdemeanors.  Any person\r\nconvicted in the District Court had the right to a trial de novo in the Superior Court.  When an appeal was taken, the prior conviction was annulled, and the\r\nprosecution began anew in the Superior Court.\r\n\r\nThe District Court convicted Perry in a bench trial and sentenced him to a six-month sentence.  Perry appealed to the Superior Court.  After Perry filed his\r\nnotice of appeal, but prior to his trial in Superior Court, the prosecutor obtained an indictment against Perry, charging him with the felony of assault and battery\r\nwith a deadly weapon with intent to kill and inflict serious bodily injury.  This indictment covered the same conduct for which Perry had been convicted in\r\nDistrict Court.  Perry pleaded guilty to the charges contained in the indictment and was sentenced to a term of five to seven years imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the United States Supreme Court held it was not constitutionally permissible for the State to respond to Perry's invocation of his\r\nstatutory right to appeal by bringing a more serious charge against him. The Court held further that Perry's guilty plea to the charges in the indictment \"did not\r\nforeclose him from attacking his conviction . . . through a federal writ of habeas corpus.\"  Blackledge, 417 U.S. at 31, 94 S. Ct. at 2104.\r\n\r\nBlackledge has no application to the facts of this case, and does not limit this Court's ability to prohibit conditional guilty pleas.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBecause a defendant's guilty plea must be unconditional, Peppers' purported plea and sentence are VACATED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. At the time of the alleged offense, section 20-7-50 provided that:\r\n\r\n  It is unlawful for a person who has legal custody of a child or helpless person, without legal excuse, to refuse or neglect to provide the proper care and\r\nattention, as defined in Section 20-7-490, for the child or helpless person, so that the life, health, or comfort of the child or helpless person is endangered or is\r\nlikely to be endangered.\r\n  A person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined in the discretion of the court or imprisoned not\r\nmore than ten years, or both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25331","title":"Arthurs v.

The circuit court granted Department's directed verdict motion, and \r\n  the Court of Appeals affirmed. Arthurs v. Aiken County, South Carolina Sheriff's \r\n  Dep't, 338 S.C. 253, 525 S.E.2d 542 (Ct. App. 1999). We granted certiorari \r\n  to consider issues of duty and the continued viability of the \"public duty rule\" \r\n  in light of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (TCA), (1) \r\n  and now affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeborah and Husband were living in separate trailers in a family enclave in rural Aiken County.  Around 9 a.m. on\r\nSeptember 30, 1994, Deborah called 911 and complained that Husband had tried to run her off the road that morning as she\r\nreturned home from work.  Their daughter testified that she observed Husband speaking to officers of the Department\r\naround 5 p.m. that same day as she and Deborah left the trailer for school band practice.  No other evidence was offered\r\nregarding this conversation.\r\n\r\nAround 6 p.m., Deborah was talking on her home phone to her sister, who was in her trailer about 500 feet away.  The\r\nsister heard knocking on Deborah's trailer door, and told Deborah to hang up and call 911.  Deborah did so, as did her\r\nsister.  Investigator Coleman and Deputy Cain responded.  While it is not clear who was knocking on the door,  Deborah\r\nand her 17-year-old nephew reported to the officers that Husband had approached the nephew and a neighbor (Rob) as they\r\nbegan to work on Deborah's water lines.  Husband asked if they \"were the gang that's supposed to jump on him.\"  He tried\r\nto get nephew to hit him, threw a beer in the nephew's face, and gestured threateningly towards the gun in his back pocket. \r\nHe was reported to have been \"raising hell\" in Deborah's front yard. \r\n\r\nHusband was not present when the officers arrived.   Deputy Cain continued to talk to Deborah and her nephew while\r\nInvestigator Coleman left to try to locate Husband.  In his report, Deputy Cain characterized the nephew as the victim and\r\nDeborah as the complainant, and he did not document it as a \"serious\" complaint.  When Deborah expressed her fear of\r\nHusband, Deputy Cain advised her to go to a safe house.  When she declined to leave, he told her she should stay inside\r\nbehind locked doors and call 911 if Husband returned.\r\n\r\nSometime later that evening, nephew went to join his brother at Kneece's Body Shop to work on a race car.  The shop was\r\nabout 300 yards from nephew's trailer, which was less than 100 yards from Deborah's trailer.  Husband was at the shop\r\nwhen nephew arrived, and again tried to start a fight.  Nephew turned to walk home, and Husband said, \"Go get your\r\nMama and Daddy and I'll send both of them to hell.\"  Husband and his truck were at the Body Shop when nephew left. \r\nDepartment responded to nephew's family's 911 call, but their search for Husband was unsuccessful.  His truck remained\r\nparked at the shop.\r\n\r\nAround 9:30 or 10 p.m. that night, family members heard screaming from Deborah's trailer followed by shots.  Husband\r\nhad forced the neighbor, Rob, to knock on Deborah's door by holding a gun to his back.  When Deborah answered the\r\ndoor, Husband forced his way in and killed her by shooting her in the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe granted certiorari to consider three issues:\r\n\r\n(1) Whether the \"public duty rule\" survived the adoption of the TCA?;\r\n\r\n(2) Whether the Court of Appeals misread the facts?; and\r\n\r\n(3) Whether Department owed Deborah a duty of care?\r\n\r\nWe hold the public duty rule continues to play its role in our governmental tort liability jurisprudence.  Further, we find no\r\nfactual error in the Court of Appeals' decision although we characterize the evidence and its inferences somewhat\r\ndifferently.  Finally, we hold petitioner has not shown a duty running from Department to Deborah.  Accordingly, we\r\naffirm the Court of Appeals' decision as modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. Public Duty Rule and the TCA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to establish liability in a negligence \r\n  action, the plaintiff must show (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to \r\n  the plaintiff; (2) breach of that duty; and (3) damages resulting from the breach. \r\n  Tanner v. Florence County Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 521 S.E.2d 153 (1999). \r\n  An affirmative legal duty to act may be created by statute, contract relationship, \r\n  status, property interest, or some other special circumstance. Steinke v. \r\n  South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, \r\n  520 S.E.2d 142 (1999); Jensen v. Anderson County Dep't of Social Services, \r\n  304 S.C. 195, 403 S.E.2d 615 (1991). When, and only when, the plaintiff relies \r\n  upon a statute as creating the duty does a doctrine known as the \"public duty \r\n  rule\" come into play. (2)  \r\n\r\nThe enactment of the TCA effectively expanded the scope of actionable governmental duties beyond those predicated upon\r\na statutory duty, as is clear from the language of the Act:\r\n\r\n\r\n(i)  Section 15-78-40 (Supp. 2000) provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe State, an agency, a political  subdivision, and a governmental entity are liable for their torts in the same manner and to\r\nthe same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the  limitations upon liability and damages, and \r\nexemptions from liability and damages contained herein.\r\n\r\n  \r\n(ii)   Section 15-78-50 (Supp. 2000) provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\n(a) Any person who may suffer a loss proximately caused by a tort of the State, an agency, a political subdivision, or a\r\ngovernmental entity, and its employee acting within the scope of his official duty may file a claim as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n(b) In no case is a governmental entity liable for a tort of an employee where that employee, if a private person, would not\r\nbe liable under the laws of this state.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (iii)  See also  Â§ 15-78-20(a)(Supp. \r\n    2000) \" . . . Liability for acts or omissions under this chapter is based \r\n    upon the traditional tort concepts of duty and the reasonably prudent person's \r\n    standard of care in the performance of that duty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nToday, a plaintiff alleging negligence on the part of a governmental actor or entity may rely either upon a duty created by\r\nstatute or one founded on the common law.  As explained below, petitioner relies on both grounds in an effort to establish a\r\nduty owed by Department to Deborah. \r\n\r\n\"The 'public duty' rule presumes statutes which \r\n  create or define the duties of a public office have the essential purpose of \r\n  providing for the structure and operation of government or for securing the \r\n  general welfare and safety of the public. Such statutes create no duty of care \r\n  towards individual members of the general public.\" Summers v. Harrison Constr., \r\n  298 S.C. 451, 455-56, 381 S.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct. App. 1989). The public duty rule \r\n  is a negative defense which denies an essential element of the plaintiff's cause \r\n  of action: the existence of a duty of care to the individual plaintiff. Rayfield \r\n  v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 297 S.C. 95, 105-06, 374 S.E.2d \r\n  910, 916 (Ct. App. 1988), cert. denied 298 S.C. 204, 379 S.E.2d 133 \r\n  (1989). It is not a matter of immunity, which is an affirmative defense that \r\n  must be pleaded and which may be waived. Steinke, supra. Further, \r\n  it is a rule of statutory construction, that is, a means of determining whether \r\n  the legislative body that enacted the statute or ordinance intended to create \r\n  a private cause of action for its breach. Jensen, supra.\r\n\r\nThe public duty rule insulates public officials, \r\n  employees, and governmental entities from liability for the negligent performance \r\n  of their official duties by negating the existence of a duty towards the plaintiff. \r\n  Whether the adoption of the TCA affects the public duty rule has been mentioned, \r\n  but not directly decided, in a number of cases. See, e.g., Steinke, \r\n  supra, 336 S.C. at 388n.3, 520 S.E.2d at 149n.3 (since both parties have \r\n  assumed public duty rule survives end of sovereign immunity and enactment of \r\n  TCA, court did not decide import, if any); see also Brady Dev. Co., \r\n  Inc. v. Town of Hilton Head, 312 S.C. at 76n.2, 439 S.E.2d at 268n.2 (1993); \r\n  Jensen, supra.\r\n\r\nThe issue is, however, squarely raised in this \r\n  case. The TCA does not create causes of action, but removes the common law bar \r\n  of sovereign immunity in certain circumstances. Summers v. Harrison Constr., \r\n  supra. Since the public duty rule is not grounded in immunity but rather \r\n  in duty, Steinke, supra; Rayfield, supra, we hold \r\n  it has not been affected by enactment of the TCA.\r\n\r\nThe TCA and \"public duty rule\" are not incompatible \r\n  and we retain the rule. When the negligence plaintiff's cause of action against \r\n  a governmental entity is founded upon a statutory duty, then whether that duty \r\n  will support the claim should be analyzed under the rule. On the other hand, \r\n  where the duty relied upon is based upon the common law, e.g. the duty to warn \r\n  in Rogers v. South Carolina Dep't of Parole &amp; Community Corrections, \r\n  320 S.C. 253, 464 S.E.2d 330 (1995), then the existence of that duty is analyzed \r\n  as it would be were the defendant a private entity. Id.\r\n\r\nIn addition, many \"duties\" appear to be limited or eliminated by what are termed \"Exceptions to waiver of immunity\" in\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§15-78-60 (Supp. 2000).  Thus, even if negligence (including breach of a duty) is shown, the governmental\r\nentity may not be liable because of the immunities reinstituted by the TCA.  Only if a duty is found, and the other\r\nnegligence elements shown, will it ever be necessary to reach the TCA immunities issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n    B. Statutory Duties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner claims Department breached statutory duties owed to Deborah under the Criminal Domestic Violence (CDV)\r\nAct (3) and under a statute describing the duty of a deputy sheriff to patrol a county. (4)  The Court of Appeals found no\r\nspecial duty of care under either statute, and thus upheld the grant of a directed verdict.  We agree.\r\n\r\nThe \"public duty rule\" recognizes that, generally, \r\n  statutes which create or define the duties of a public office create no duty \r\n  of care towards individual members of the general public. An exception to the \r\n  general rule exists when the statutory duty is owed to individuals rather than \r\n  to the public at large. Our courts are reluctant to find a special duty. Tanner \r\n  v. Florence County Treasurer, supra. In Jensen, supra, \r\n  and Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. 291, 408 S.E.2d 219 (1991), this Court \r\n  adopted a six part test developed by the Court of Appeals in Rayfield, \r\n  supra, for determining when such a \"special duty\" exists:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) an essential purpose of the statute is to protect against a particular type of harm;\r\n\r\n(2) the statute, either directly or indirectly, imposes on a specific public officer a duty to guard against or not cause that\r\nharm;\r\n\r\n(3) the class of persons the statute intends to protect is identifiable before the fact;\r\n\r\n(4) the plaintiff is a person within the protected class;\r\n\r\n(5) the public officer knows or has reason to know the likelihood of harm to members of the class if he fails to do his duty;\r\nand\r\n\r\n(6) the officer is given sufficient authority to act in the circumstances or he undertakes to act in the exercise of his office.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues the CDV Act creates a special duty to Deborah because it is designed to protect against a particular harm,\r\nthat is, threats or acts of violence directed by one household member against another (Â§Â§16-25-10 and -20).  In this case,\r\nthe officers responded to two calls on September 30 where Deborah's nephew, brother, and sister-in-law were designated\r\nthe victims.  To the extent her nephew was the victim, the CDV Act is not even implicated. (5)  While Deborah's brother and\r\narguably his wife were related within the second degree to Husband, petitioner points to no breach of duty under the Act by\r\nDepartment towards these victims, much less a breach directed toward Deborah.\r\n\r\nTo the extent Deborah was identifiable as the true object of Husband's hostility, petitioner cannot show where any CDV\r\nAct duty was breached.  Husband was not present at the scene when the officers arrived, and therefore was not subject to\r\nimmediate arrest.  Further, the evidence shows that Department searched for Husband but could not find him.  Finally,\r\nDeputy Cain advised Deborah to leave and go to a shelter.  Petitioner points to no section of the CDV Act requiring the law\r\nenforcement agency to post a guard under these circumstance.  In short, assuming the CDV Act is implicated by the facts of\r\nthis case, petitioner has failed to show the existence of a special duty owed to Deborah, much less breach of such a duty. (6)\r\n\r\nPetitioner's second \"special duty\" argument is predicated on Â§23-13-70 which provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deputy sheriffs shall patrol the entire county at least twice a week by sections assigned to each by the sheriff,\r\nremaining on duty at night when occasion or circumstances suggest the propriety thereof to prevent or detect crime or to\r\nmake an arrest.  They shall always be on duty for not less than ten hours a day, except when granted occasional indulgences\r\nor leaves of absence by the sheriff.  They shall frequent railroad depots, stores and other public places where people\r\ncongregate, disorder is probable, vagrants may be loafing or alcoholic liquors may be sold, bartered or given away and they\r\nshall as often as practicable ride by houses that are off the public highways and in lonely parts of the county, especially\r\nsuch as are without male protectors, and shall use every means to prevent or detect, arrest and prosecute for breaches of\r\nthe peace, drunkenness, using obscene language, boisterous conduct or discharging of firearms on the public highways or at\r\nany public place or gathering, carrying weapons contrary to law, gambling, vagrance, setting out fire, violation of the game\r\nand fish laws, cruelty to animals or children, violation of the child labor laws, lynching and for the violation of every law\r\nwhich is detrimental to the peace, good order and morals of the community.\r\n  (emphasis petitioner's).  \r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends this statute created a special duty on the part of Department to \"use every means\" to prevent violations\r\nof the CDV Act, and/or to arrest violators.\r\n\r\nThis general statute creates no \"special duty,\" \r\n  but instead, as the Court of Appeals held, \"merely recites, in broad terms, \r\n  the general duty of a deputy sheriff to patrol the county . . . . The requirements \r\n  of the Rayfield test are not satisfied.\" Arthurs, supra.\r\n\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appeals' holding that petitioner has not shown a special duty owed to Deborah under either the\r\nCDV Act or under Â§23-13-70.  \r\n\r\n\r\n    C. Common Law Duty/Factual Error\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends the facts of this case establish \r\n  a legal duty arising from a \"special circumstance\" because Deputy Cain set Deborah \r\n  up as \"bait\" to try to arrest Husband.  See Jensen, supra (duty \r\n  can arise from \"special circumstance\"). Petitioner argues, in connection with \r\n  this issue, that the Court of Appeals \"ignored\" Deputy Cain's deposition testimony \r\n  when it concluded that Cain \"did not convey to [Deborah] that he wanted \r\n  to use her as 'bait' in an attempt to capture Husband.\" Arthurs, 338 \r\n  S.C. at 268, 525 S.E.2d at 550.\r\n\r\nThe flaw in petitioner's theory is that there is no evidence that the Department was  \"baiting\" a trap with Deborah.  The\r\nevidence is undisputed that when Deputy Cain responded to the first incident, where Husband threatened Deborah's\r\nnephew in her yard, he told her that if she refused to go to a safe house, she should stay indoors behind locked doors and\r\ncall 911 if Husband returned.  In his deposition, he testified that after Deborah refused his offer \" to help her get to a safe\r\nhouse\" (emphasis added), he told her to stay behind a locked door and call 911 if Husband came back.   He continued:\r\n\r\n\r\nJust call us and we'll come down here with all of us, we'll take care of him in the front yard.  We'll take care of it.  And\r\n[Deborah] told me young man, she called me young man or called me son, or something to [sic] that nature.  I believe she\r\nsaid young man, he's got a gun, and my response to her was, so do I and my friends and we know what to do with ours and\r\nlet us take care of a gun problem.  You stay inside but whatever you do, don't unlock the door for him.  I wanted her\r\nto set him up so he was in the front yard when we show up.  That's all I was trying to convey to her and we'll take\r\ncare of the problem, you know, the way we were trained to, and after that I pretty much left.\r\n  (emphasis added).  \r\n\r\n\r\nCain explained at trial that he did not convey the \"set up\" thought to Deborah, but was \"insuring [sic] her that myself and\r\nmy fellow law enforcement officers knew exactly what to do once we came in contact with this man and for her to stay\r\nbehind a locked door if she did not want to leave the area.\" \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals relied on the fact that there \r\n  was no evidence that Deputy Cain conveyed to Deborah that he wanted to \r\n  use her as bait in concluding no special circumstances here gave rise to a duty. \r\n  In our opinion, it is more accurate to say there was no \"baiting\" here. Despite \r\n  Deborah's fear of Husband and his armed appearance in her front yard, Deborah \r\n  refused Deputy Cain's offer to get her away from there and to a safe location. \r\n  In context, all that was \"conveyed\" was to stay indoors and call at the first \r\n  sighting of Husband, not to wait for him to act provocatively. He did not encourage \r\n  her to stay in an effort to lure Husband back - he encouraged her to leave. \r\n  Husband lived one trailer over, and was therefore bound to return at some point; \r\n  certainly if he were in Deborah's front yard when officers responded to her \r\n  911 call, he would be easy to pick out and arrest.\r\n\r\nSince we find no evidence of baiting, there is \r\n  no need to decide whether such conduct can constitute a \"special circumstance\" \r\n  giving rise to a common law duty. In light of the lack of evidence, we decline \r\n  to adopt a test for determining when such a duty may arise. Further, we vacate \r\n  that part of the Court of Appeals' opinion which adopts the North Carolina test \r\n  found in Braswell v. Braswell, 410 S.E.2d 897 (N.C. 1991). We do this \r\n  in part because the issue is not before us, and in part because North Carolina \r\n  characterizes this type of common law duty as a \"special duty\" exception to \r\n  the \"public duty rule.\" Id. at 902. We find the North Carolina language \r\n  potentially confusing because, as explained above, we restrict the terms public \r\n  duty/special duty to those arising from statutes. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circumstances surrounding Deborah's murder are tragic.  Despite our sympathy, however, we cannot find the existence\r\nof any duty, much less the breach of such an obligation, under the facts presented here.  Accordingly, the decision of the\r\nCourt of Appeals is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1. S.C. Code Ann.

Zelenka, of\r\nColumbia, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This matter is before \r\n  the Court on a Butler (1) petition for \r\n  a writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner, now on death row, \r\n  (2) contends that errors in his capital sentencing proceeding warrant \r\n  this Court's exercise of the writ. We find that the Allen \r\n  (3) charge given to petitioner's sentencing jury was unconstitutionally \r\n  coercive and \"in the setting, constitute[d] a denial of fundamental \r\n  fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.\" Butler v. State, \r\n  302 S.C. 466, 468, 397 S.E.2d 87, 88 (1990). Accordingly, we grant the writ \r\n  and remand for a new sentencing proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. Facts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have adopted, with minor modifications, the findings of fact (4) made by the state post-conviction relief (PCR) judge:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The jury begins sentencing deliberations at 1:33 p.m. on October 27,\r\n    1993.\r\n\r\n  &nbsp;  At 5:02 p.m., the jury returns with this question: \"In the event of a decision for a life sentence - what is the possibility of parole, if any,\" and the trial court\r\nresponds:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhether or not the defendant would or would not be eligible for parole should not enter into your deliberations or factor into your decision.  The terms a death\r\nsentence and a life imprisonment sentence are to be understood in their plain and ordinary meaning.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Sometime between 5:03 p.m. and 5:55 p.m., the jury returns with a second note: \"We are deadlocked at 10-2 for the death penalty.  We are not making any\r\nfurther progress.  We would like to hear [petitioner's] testimony, and then continue our deliberation until 10:00 PM - unless we reach a verdict before then.\" \r\nThe trial judge does not read this note to counsel; he does tell counsel that the jury wanted to rehear testimony.  The jury declines the judge's offer to order\r\ndinner, preferring to wait until after the testimony is replayed.  Testimony is then replayed over the next hour, and the jury retires to deliberate at 6:53 p.m.\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Around 8:03 p.m., the jury sends another note: \"We are not going to reach a decision tonight.  We would like to go back to the motel and resume\r\ndeliberations in the morning. (We can eat at the motel).\"   No party objects, and the jury is excused for the evening.\r\n    \r\n\r\n  The jury returns and begins deliberations the next day at 9:00 a.m.  Around 10:44 a.m., the jury sends another note: \"We are hopelessly deadlocked at 11-1\r\nfor the death penalty.  I do not feel we will ever get an[sic] unanimous decision.\"  Again, the trial court does not read the note in court although the judge\r\ninforms the parties that he intends \"to bring them back in to inquire and perhaps to give them additional instruction.\"   The attorneys are made aware only\r\nthat the vote is 11-1; no mention is made of  \"hopelessly deadlocked.\"   Petitioner's counsel then objects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n    Well, let met [sic] state that I know that the \r\n      Court is going to give additional instructions. Prior to anything that would \r\n      be either a watered-down version of an Allen charge, we would ask that the \r\n      Court inquire as to whether or not in the jury's opinion they feel that \r\n      they are hopelessly deadlocked.\r\n\r\n    Additionally, we would further submit that if the \r\n      Court gives a charge that would be, again, a watered-down Allen charge we \r\n      would also request that the Court instruct the jury that other consequences \r\n      of not reaching a decision in a death-penalty case dealing specifically \r\n      with the penalty phase, that the defendant would receive life imprisonment. \r\n      Our authority is based primarily on some Florida cases. I can cite those \r\n      to you, but that basically would be our position on that.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe trial court then gives this charge:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen.  I understand from a note handed up by way of the bailiff that apparently came from the foreman, is [sic] that you are\r\nhaving some difficulty in arriving at a unanimous decision.  I intend to give you a little further instruction, and then I am going to ask you to go back to the jury\r\nroom to continue for some time with your deliberations.\r\n\r\nNow, as I told you in the beginning of the trial, you are the sole judges of the facts in the case and I am the judge of the law in this case.  I am not permitted to in\r\nany fashion give you a hint as to how I feel about the verdict or how the case should be decided.  That is not my decision; that is not my purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is your decision as to the appropriate sentence that should be imposed in this particular case based upon your view of the evidence as well as the application\r\nof the law; but I can say that when a matter is in dispute it isn't always easy for even two persons to agree, and when 12 men and women must agree as to a\r\nparticular decision, it becomes correspondingly more difficult, but it's important that jurors reach a unanimous verdict if that may be accomplished without a\r\njuror doing violence to his or her own conscience.\r\n\r\nAt the same time no juror is expected to give up an opinion based on reasoning satisfactory to himself or herself merely for the purpose of being in agreement\r\nwith others.\r\n\r\nIt was never intended that the verdict of the jury should be the view of any one person.  On the other hand, the verdict of the jury is the collective reasoning of\r\nall of the men and women serving on the panel.  That's why we have a jury, so that we have the benefit of collective thought and of collective reasoning.\r\n\r\nNow, it becomes each of your duties as jurors to tell the other jurors how you feel about the case and why you think as you do.  It becomes each of your duties\r\nto exchange views with the other jurors, and you should listen to each other and give to the other's thought such meaning as you think it should have.\r\n\r\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, at this time I am going to ask you to consider that further instruction.  Go back into the jury room and continue your deliberations and\r\nsee if you can arrive at a unanimous verdict.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPetitioner's counsel then objects again:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Your Honor, on the specific charge and on the \r\n    Allen charge in and of itself, I object to the entire charge, per se. \r\n    It's the very nature of an Allen charge outside of public policy, that \r\n    it helps avoid the cost of another trial which would not be applicable here.\r\n\r\n  The very nature of any sort of an Allen \r\n    charge is coercive in nature. It is our position particularly at paragraph \r\n    number - the third paragraph referred to by the Court is, in effect - it could \r\n    be interpreted as singling out either one or two jurors and could lead to \r\n    some coerciveness inside the deliberations.\r\n\r\nIt could be interpreted by a juror that that juror has to switch over because of a particular charge.  So we would object to the charge in toto as being coercive,\r\nand just renew again our request that they be given further instruction as to the consequences of not being able to reach a unanimous verdict.  That would be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  At 12:27 p.m., the jury returns a unanimous recommendation of death.\r\n\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n    B. Procedural History\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner's trial attorney asked that the jury \r\n  be informed of the consequences of its inability to reach a sentencing decision. \r\n  Following the Allen charge, which did not include a \"consequences\" charge, \r\n  the trial attorney objected to the Allen charge as coercive \"in toto\" \r\n  and \"per se,\" and objected that the charge could be interpreted as singling \r\n  out the minority juror. On direct appeal, petitioner argued (1) that the trial \r\n  judge should have instructed the jury not to reveal its vote and (2) that the \r\n  Allen charge was improper because the judge knew there was only one juror \r\n  holding out. State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. at 427-28, 462 S.E.2d at 264-65. \r\n  We found these claims procedurally barred because petitioner was improperly \r\n  altering the grounds raised at trial on appeal.  Id. at 428, 462 S.E.2d \r\n  at 265. (5)\r\n\r\nAt the PCR proceeding, petitioner claimed appellate \r\n  counsel was constitutionally ineffective in altering the Allen charge \r\n  argument. Appellate counsel acknowledged he had deliberately \"blurred\" the issues \r\n  because his research convinced him that the objection at trial would not succeed \r\n  on appeal. The PCR judge found no constitutional deprivation since appellate \r\n  counsel has no duty to raise every non-frivolous issue, and must be allowed \r\n  to exercise his reasonable professional judgment. Jones v. Barnes, 463 \r\n  U.S. 745 (1983); Thrift v. State, 302 S.C. 535, 397 S.E.2d 523 (1990). \r\n  We denied certiorari.\r\n\r\nAs the foregoing demonstrates, this Court has never \r\n  addressed petitioner's allegation that the Allen charge was unconstitutionally \r\n  coercive on the merits. Further, we consider for the first time petitioner's \r\n  claim that his jury engaged in \"reasonable deliberation\" as a matter of law, \r\n  thereby requiring the trial judge to direct a life sentence pursuant to S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§16-3-20(C) (Supp. 2000). (6)  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn keeping with our policy of not reaching constitutional \r\n  issues unless necessary to the resolution of the case, we first discuss petitioner's \r\n  statutory claim. E.g., Fairway Ford, Inc. v. County of Greenville, \r\n  324 S.C. 84, 476 S.E.2d 490 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n    C. Reasonable Deliberation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of Â§16-3-20(C)'s instruction that the trial judge impose a life sentence if a capital sentencing jury cannot reach a recommendation after a\r\n\"reasonable deliberation\" presents a novel question. \r\n\r\nWhile \"reasonable deliberation\" is something less \r\n  than the \"due and thorough deliberation\" standard of our \"two return\" statute, \r\n  (7) we hold that the determination whether a particular jury has met \r\n  such a standard is a matter committed to the trial judge's discretion. See, \r\n  e.g., Buff v. South Carolina Dep't of Transportation, 342 S.C. 416, \r\n  537 S.E.2d 279 (2000) (\"trial judge who is in the best position to observe the \r\n  jury's demeanor should have some flexibility in guiding a case to its final \r\n  resolution while protecting the parties' rights to a fair, impartial, and conscientious \r\n  verdict\").\r\n\r\nThe State contends that we should look at the time \r\n  spent in face-to-face deliberations while petitioner contends we should look \r\n  at the entire period. In our view, however, \"reasonable deliberation\" is not \r\n  simply an elapsed-time dependent determination. In State v. Atkins, 303 \r\n  S.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d 760 (1990), the Court held there was no error in requiring \r\n  the re-sentencing jury to continue deliberating when it reported, after 3 Â½ \r\n  hours of deliberation, that it was \"hung.\" The statutory \"reasonable deliberation\" \r\n  issue was neither raised nor decided in Atkins, nor in State v. Yates, \r\n  280 S.C. 29, 310 S.E.2d 805 (1982), subsequent history omitted (judge \r\n  sent jury back when it returned after 50 minutes and reported a deadlock; only \r\n  appellate issue was whether it was error to refuse to charge effect of hung \r\n  jury); see also State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 \r\n  (1999) (Allen charge given after four hours of deliberation was not coercive).\r\n\r\nHere, a substantial period of time elapsed between the jury's beginning deliberations (1:33 p.m. on the 27th) and the time it informed the judge it was\r\n\"hopelessly deadlocked\" (10:44 a.m. on the 28th).  Further, the evidence in the record demonstrates that petitioner's  jury took its responsibility seriously, and\r\nthat it was a jury working diligently to reach a verdict.  Under these circumstances, had the issue been raised to him, the trial judge in his discretion may or may\r\nnot have found the jury had engaged in a \"reasonable deliberation.\"  In order to grant relief on this ground we would be required to hold that, as a matter of law,\r\nthis jury had done so.  This we decline to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n    D. Coercive Allen Charge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither the Due Process clause nor the Eighth Amendment \r\n  forbid the giving of an Allen charge in the sentencing phase of a capital \r\n  proceeding. Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988);  see also  \r\n  Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373 (1999) (no constitutional requirement \r\n  that capital jury be informed of consequences of its failure to agree). Whether \r\n  an Allen charge is unconstitutionally coercive must be judged \"in its \r\n  context and under all the circumstances.\" Lowenfield, supra. While \r\n  recognizing the State's strong interest in having a jury determine the sentence, \r\n  Lowenfield reaffirmed that the \"qualitative difference between death \r\n  and other penalties calls for a greater degree of reliability when the death \r\n  sentence is imposed.\" Id. (internal citations omitted). The Court also \r\n  noted that the societal costs of a retrial are not a factor in those cases where, \r\n  as in South Carolina, the law provides for a life sentence if a capital sentencing \r\n  jury hangs. Id.\r\n\r\nLowenfield is the definitive United States \r\n  Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of an Allen charge in \r\n  a capital sentencing proceeding. The test for determining whether a given charge \r\n  is unconstitutionally coercive is very fact intensive. For that reason, we have \r\n  discussed Lowenfield in some detail below.\r\n\r\nAfter the jury convicted Lowenfield of two counts of manslaughter and three counts of murder, the initial charge in the sentencing phase admonished the jurors\r\nto consider the view of others with the object of reaching a verdict, but also instructed them not to give up their own honest beliefs in order to do so.  The jury\r\ndeliberated late into the night and resumed the next day.  During that afternoon, the foreman sent a note that the jury was unable to reach a verdict at that time\r\nand asked for a recharge on the jurors' responsibilities.  In response to the judge's inquiry, eleven of the jurors responded that further deliberations would\r\nprobably allow them to reach a verdict.  The trial judge charged the jury:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you enter the jury room it is your duty to consult with one another to consider each other's views and to discuss the evidence with the objective of\r\nreaching a just verdict if you can do so without violence to that individual judgment.\r\n\r\nEach of you must decide the case for yourself but only after discussion and impartial consideration of the case with your fellow jurors.  You are not advocates\r\nfor one side or the other.  Do not hesitate to reexamine your own views and to change your opinion if you are convinced you are wrong but do not surrender\r\nyour honest belief as to the weight and effect of evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty minutes later, the jury returned a death sentence on all three murder counts.\r\n\r\nIn upholding the constitutionality of this charge, the Court considered:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the charge did not speak specifically to the minority juror(s);\r\n\r\n(2) the judge did not include in his charge any language such as \"You have got to reach a decision in this case\" (8);\r\n\r\n(3) there was no inquiry into the jury's numerical division, which is generally coercive; and \r\n\r\n(4) while the jury returned a verdict shortly after the supplemental charge,  which suggests a possibility of coercion,  weighing against this is the fact that trial\r\ncounsel did not object either to the inquiry into whether the jurors believed further deliberation would result in a verdict, nor to the supplemental charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lowenfield court concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold that on these facts the combination of the polling of the jury and the supplemental instruction was not \"coercive\" in such a way as to deny petitioner\r\nany constitutional right.  By so holding we do not mean to be understood as saying other combinations of supplemental charges and polling might not require a\r\ndifferent conclusion.  Any criminal defendant, and especially any capital defendant, being tried by a jury is entitled to the uncoerced verdict of that body.\r\n\r\n\r\nLowenfield sets the standard by which petitioner's \r\n  constitutional claim is to be judged. We therefore apply the Lowenfield \r\n  factors to petitioner's facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Did the charge speak specifically to minority jurors?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these jurors were told that they should not do \"violence to his or her own conscience\" in order to reach a verdict, and not to give up an opinion \"based on\r\nreasoning satisfactory to himself or herself merely for the purpose of . . . agreement . .  .\", the jurors were also charged:\r\n\r\n\r\n[W]hen 12 men and women must agree as to a particular decision, it becomes correspondingly more difficult, but it's important that jurors reach a unanimous\r\nverdict . . . . \r\n\r\nIt was never intended that the verdict of the jury should be the view of any one person.  On the other hand, the verdict of the jury is the collective reasoning of\r\nall of the men and women serving on the panel.  That's why we have a jury, so that we may have the benefit of collective thought and of collective reasoning.  \r\n\r\nNow, it becomes each of your duties as jurors to tell the other jurors how you feel about the case and why you think as you do.  It becomes each of your duties\r\nto exchange views with the other jurors, and you should listen to each other and give to the other's thought such meaning as you think it should have.\r\n\r\n\r\nViewed as a whole, this jury charge was directed \r\n  to the minority juror. The trial judge knew, and apparently the jury knew that \r\n  he knew, that while there had been two hold-out jurors as of 5 p.m. the night \r\n  before, there was now only one. See State v. Hughes, supra \r\n  (an even-handed admonition to minority and majority to give consideration to \r\n  each others' views not coercive); State v. Jones, 320 S.C. 555, 466 S.E.2d \r\n  733 (Ct. App. 1996) (viewed as a whole, Allen charge given when judge \r\n  knew division was 11-1 not coercive where judge did not know alignment, urged \r\n  dissenting jurors to consider whether their positions were unreasonable in light \r\n  of majority's judgment, but told them the verdict must be juror's own, the result \r\n  of his convictions, and not mere acquiescence in the others' conclusion).\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  \"You must return a verdict\" type language.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile no such mandatory language was used here, petitioner's jury was told of the importance of a unanimous verdict. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Inquiry into the jury's numerical division.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner's jury informed the trial judge of their \r\n  numerical split, as well as their alignment, on the first evening. Not only \r\n  did the judge fail to inform the attorneys of the note's contents, he failed \r\n  to instruct the jurors not to disclose their division in the future. Cf. \r\n  State v. Middleton, 218 S.C. 452, 63 S.E.2d 163 (1951) (improper for \r\n  judge to require the jury to publicly reveal the nature or extent of their division).\r\n\r\nWhile the trial judge did not engage in polling \r\n  the jury as to its division, a practice condemned in Lowenfield, supra \r\n  and in Brasfield v. United States, 272 U.S. 448 (1926), he did not act \r\n  to prevent the jury's self-reporting. In Brasfield, the Court held that \r\n  \"the inquiry into the jury's numerical division necessitated reversal because \r\n  it was generally coercive and always brought to bear 'in some degree, serious \r\n  although not measurable, an improper influence on the jury.'\" Lowenfield, \r\n  supra (internal citation omitted). The Lowenfield Court noted \r\n  Brasfield was not a constitutional decision but rather a \"supervisory \r\n  powers\"case. None-the-less, knowledge of the jury's numerical division combined \r\n  with knowledge of its decisional disagreement, followed by an Allen charge \r\n  directed, at least in part, to minority jurors, is impermissibly coercive. Lowenfield, \r\n  supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Time of return of verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner's jury returned the death sentence at \r\n  12:27 p.m., approximately an hour and a half after receiving the Allen \r\n  charge. This is a relatively short period of time given the fact the dissenting \r\n  juror had been holding out since at least 5 p.m. the day before. Further, petitioner's \r\n  attorney, unlike Lowenfield's, did object to the Allen charge, and had \r\n  no opportunity to object to the jury's revelation of its divisions. This factor \r\n  weighs in favor of a finding of coercion.\r\n\r\nComparing this case with Lowenfield, we \r\n  find petitioner's Allen charge unconstitutionally coercive. We agree \r\n  with the Fourth Circuit's holding that \"the import of the charge was that the \r\n  single juror (whom every member of the jury knew was holding out) should not \r\n  prevent the majority from imposing the death penalty\" and that the charge was \r\n  therefore impermissibly coercive under the totality of the circumstances. Tucker \r\n  v. Catoe, 221 F.3d at 612. We hold that the Allen charge given in \r\n  this case violated petitioner's due process rights.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion, however, does not end our Butler \r\n  inquiry, for relief is appropriate only where the violation \"in the setting, \r\n  constitutes a denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense \r\n  of justice.\" Butler v. State, supra. We hold this standard has \r\n  been met here. \r\n\r\nPetitioner and his attorneys were denied a meaningful opportunity to protect petitioner's rights.  The judge did not disclose the contents of the jury's first note,\r\nwhich revealed a 10-2 deadlock in favor of the death penalty, but rather told the attorneys only that the jury wished to rehear some testimony.  When the jury\r\nsent a note the next day, the judge did inform the attorneys that the jury was divided 11-1, but again did not reveal that the jury was in favor of death, nor that\r\nthe foreman had used the term \"hopelessly deadlocked,\" nor that he had written \"I do not feel we will ever get an unanimous verdict.\"  \r\n\r\nWe find the combination of withholding pertinent \r\n  information from the parties, thereby depriving them of the facts necessary \r\n  to make informed decisions; failing to instruct the jury to omit from its future \r\n  communication any reference to the nature of its division; and giving an unconstitutionally \r\n  coercive Allen charge, with its emphasis on a collective result, shocking \r\n  to the universal sense of justice. We emphasize that it is the combination of \r\n  factors, in the setting, which compel us to grant petitioner a writ \r\n  of habeas corpus and to order a new sentencing proceeding.\r\n\r\nWrit granted.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

Savitz, III, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant\r\nAttorney General Derrick K. McFarland; and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  Appellant was convicted of the armed robbery and murder of Amber Bone (\"the victim\").  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe victim was stabbed in the back nine times and her skull was crushed.  Appellant's friend LaShawn Roberts was separately tried and convicted for the same\r\ncrimes.  Appellant's defense was that Roberts was obsessed with appellant and killed the victim in a jealous rage because of the victim's sexual advances\r\ntoward appellant.  Appellant raises two alleged errors which, she asserts, undermine both convictions:\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Did the trial court err by refusing to suppress a custodial statement improperly obtained after appellant invoked her right to counsel?\r\n\r\nII.  Did the trial court err by refusing to admit evidence that LaShawn Roberts wrote appellant a letter admitting she killed the victim because she was jealous?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI.  Invocation of Right to Counsel\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by refusing to suppress a custodial statement improperly obtained after she invoked her right to counsel.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAppellant gave the police three written statements, each admitting progressively more involvement in the crimes of which she was convicted.  The admissibility\r\nof the third statement is at issue here.  In it, appellant admits that (1) she hit the victim in the back of the head with a pipe, (2) she covered the victim's back\r\nwith a pillow (on Roberts' orders) because blood was shooting up, (3) she helped Roberts clean up after the murder, (4) the victim was still alive when she and\r\nRoberts left the scene, and (5) she helped Roberts dispose of evidence of the crime.  \r\n\r\nAppellant moved to suppress the statement on the \r\n  ground it was improperly obtained after she had invoked her right to counsel. \r\n  At the  in camera  suppression hearing, the police officer who questioned \r\n  appellant testified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I advised her of her rights, the substance of the conversation was her involvement in this particular incident. . . .  She requested to speak to either a lawyer\r\nor her mother. . . .  I asked her if she had a lawyer in mind that she wanted me to call.  She hesitated momentarily and said she didn't have a lawyer, just contact\r\nher mother for her and I said okay.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter, appellant's mother arrived at the police \r\n  station and they were allowed to speak with each other privately. \r\n  (1) In her mother's presence, the officer then advised appellant of \r\n  her rights again, and appellant's mother signed the advice of rights form as \r\n  a witness. Appellant's  in&nbsp;camera  testimony does not dispute the \r\n  officer's version of events concerning her request for an attorney or lack thereof. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court denied the motion to suppress. \r\n  The court found appellant did not make an unequivocal request for an attorney. \r\n  Furthermore, any defects, if they existed at all, were cured by the subsequent \r\n  Miranda warnings given prior to taking the third statement. \r\n\r\nThis issue is unpreserved because trial counsel \r\n  failed to make a contemporaneous objection to the statement being read into \r\n  evidence. See State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 591, 521 S.E.2d 500, \r\n  503 (1999) (an in limine ruling is not final and does not preserve the issue \r\n  for appeal).\r\n\r\nIn any case, the issue is without merit. The Fifth \r\n  Amendment guarantees the right to speak with counsel upon request in a custodial \r\n  setting. U.S. Const. amend V; Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981). \r\n  If a suspect invokes her right to counsel, police interrogation must cease unless \r\n  the suspect herself initiates further communication with police. Id. \r\n  However, police officers are not required to cease questioning a suspect unless \r\n  her request for counsel is unambiguous. Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. \r\n  452, (1994) (\"Maybe I should talk to a lawyer,\" was not a request for counsel); \r\n  but see&nbsp;State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 510 S.E.2d 714 (1998) \r\n  (\"I think I need a lawyer\" was a request for counsel). The Supreme Court has \r\n  noted that \"if a suspect is 'indecisive in his request for counsel,' the officers \r\n  need not always cease questioning.\" Davis, 512 at 460 (quoting Miranda \r\n  v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 485 (1966)). Furthermore, this Court has held \r\n  an adult's request for someone other than an attorney does not invoke a Fifth \r\n  Amendment right to speak with counsel. State v. Register, 323 S.C. 471, \r\n  477, 476 S.E.2d 153, 157 (1996) (request for mother). \r\n\r\nAppellant's request for her mother or a lawyer \r\n  was not an unambiguous invocation of her Fifth Amendment right to have counsel \r\n  present during interrogation. On the contrary, the request was completely ambiguous, \r\n  and when the officer sought clarification, appellant asked for her mother. \r\n  (2) The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting appellant's \r\n  statement. See Kennedy, 333 S.C. at 429, 510 S.E.2d at 715 (trial \r\n  court's conclusion on issues of fact as to the voluntariness of a statement \r\n  will not be disturbed unless so manifestly erroneous as to show an abuse of \r\n  discretion). \r\n\r\nII.  Exculpatory Evidence\r\n\r\nAppellant asserts the trial court erred by refusing to admit evidence that LaShawn Roberts wrote appellant a letter admitting she killed the victim because she\r\nwas jealous.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nThe defense proffered testimony from appellant's roommate in jail, Janet Suber, that Roberts delivered a letter to appellant threatening to kill Suber and\r\nadmitting that \"she did it for Sheri because she was in love with Sheri and Sheri didn't feel the same way about her as she did her, so that's the reason why she\r\nkilled the other girl.\"  Suber testified she gave the letter to a guard.  The guard had no recollection of Suber or this particular letter.  The trial court ruled the\r\nletter was inadmissible hearsay.  \r\n\r\nAppellant argues Suber's testimony concerning the \r\n  letter should have been admitted as a statement against interest. Statements \r\n  against interest made by an unavailable declarant (3) \r\n  may be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE. \r\n  However, \"[a] statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability \r\n  and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating \r\n  circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\" Id. \r\n   \r\n\r\nThe trial court correctly ruled the hearsay was not sufficiently corroborated to be admissible. (4)\r\n\r\n  Twice recently this Court has explained the corroboration \r\n  requirement of Rule 804(b)(3). State v. McDonald, Op. No. 25225 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed Dec. 18, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 44, at p.37); State \r\n  v. Kinloch, 338 S.C. 385, 526 S.E.2d 705 (2000). A defendant seeking to \r\n  offer a statement pursuant to this exception bears the \"formidable burden\" of \r\n  establishing that corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness \r\n  of the statement. Kinloch, 338 S.C. at 389, 526 S.E.2d at 706 (citations \r\n  omitted). Whether a statement has been sufficiently corroborated is a question \r\n  \"left to the discretion of the trial judge 'after considering the totality of \r\n  the circumstances under which a declaration against penal interest was made.'\" \r\n  McDonald, at 40 (quoting Kinloch, 338 S.C. at 391, n.5, \r\n  526 S.E.2d at 708, n.5).\r\n\r\nWe emphasized in McDonald that the corroboration \r\n  requirement \"goes not to the truth of the statement's contents, but rather to \r\n  the making of the statement.\" McDonald, at 41. The trial court here correctly \r\n  ruled the statement uncorroborated. The guard who was expected to testify that \r\n  Suber gave him the letter Roberts allegedly wrote threatening her and confessing \r\n  to the murder had no recollection of Suber or the letter. Thus, Suber's proffered \r\n  testimony is the only evidence the letter ever existed. Appellant did not carry \r\n  her burden of showing circumstances clearly corroborating the making of the \r\n  statement, and the trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in refusing \r\n  to admit the testimony.\r\n\r\nAppellant's convictions are AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Appellant was nineteen years old at the time.\r\n2. The Davis Court specifically \r\n  declined to adopt a rule requiring officers to ask clarifying questions, but \r\n  described the practice of asking clarifying questions as \"good police practice.\" \r\n  512 U.S. at 461-62. \r\n3. Roberts invoked her Fifth \r\n  Amendment privilege, and was therefore \"unavailable\" for hearsay purposes. See \r\n  State v. Doctor, 306 S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (1992). \r\n4. The trial court also ruled the testimony inadmissible because the letter, even if it existed, did not exculpate appellant.  Trial counsel argued the rule requires\r\nthe statement merely be \"offered to exculpate\"; whether the statement is exculpatory is \"for the jury to decide.\"  This issue is not argued on appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25334","title":"State v.

Justice, of Chester, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT: Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.  He appeals.  \r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant was indicted for the murder of Travelee Johnson (victim).  At trial, appellant testified in his own defense.  He stated he and victim were friends;\r\nappellant, Danny Murphy, and Robert Johnson were \"associates.\"   \r\n\r\nAppellant explained he, victim, Johnson, and Murphy planned to rob Juan Williams' home.  Using his roommate's car, appellant drove the men near Williams'\r\nhome; they waited in the car for Williams to leave home.  Appellant fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAppellant awoke when he heard victim screaming.  According to appellant, Murphy held victim while Johnson stabbed him.  Murphy and Johnson exited the\r\nvehicle and pulled victim out of the car.  Appellant drove off a short distance then returned, backing the car down the road.  He testified he planned to run over\r\nMurphy and Johnson so they would leave victim alone, but instead, Murphy and Johnson jumped into the car.  Appellant drove Murphy and Johnson back to\r\ntown.  Appellant wondered if they were going to kill him. \r\n\r\nAt Murphy's instruction, appellant stopped the vehicle at a dumpster; Murphy threw a knife inside.  Appellant then drove the men to their apartment.  Murphy\r\nand Johnson put their bloody clothing in a bag.  Appellant put the bag behind a dumpster.  He stated he took Murphy's boots to his own apartment. The next\r\nmorning, appellant gave Johnson towels and sponges and Johnson washed the car.  Appellant suggested Murphy and Johnson were angry at victim because they\r\nbelieved he had stolen items from their apartment. \r\n\r\n\r\n    ISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Did the trial court err by refusing to charge accessory after the fact to murder?  \r\n\r\nII.  Did the trial court fail to give a complete and clear instruction on accomplice liability?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant requested the trial judge instruct the jury on accessory after the fact to murder.  Noting appellant had not been indicted for accessory after the fact and\r\nthat accessory after the fact was not a lesser-included offense to murder, the trial judge denied the request but stated appellant could argue accessory after the\r\nfact. (1)  \r\n\r\nAppellant now argues the trial judge erred by refusing his requested accessory after the fact charge.  He claims because he did not know Johnson and Murphy\r\nplanned to kill victim and he was asleep when the stabbing first occurred, \"exclusionary\" facts existed to warrant a charge on accessory after the fact.  We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nThe elements of accessory after the fact to a crime \r\n  are 1) the felony has been completed, 2) the accused must have knowledge that \r\n  the principal committed the felony, and 3) the accused must harbor or assist \r\n  the principal felon. State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d 202 (1998) \r\n  (Collins II). A defendant may not be found guilty as an accessory when \r\n  indicted solely as a principal. State v. Collins, 266 S.C. 566, 225 S.E.2d \r\n  189 (1976) (Collins I). \r\n\r\n  When the defendant has not been indicted as an \r\n  accessory, it is proper to charge the jury on the difference between accessory \r\n  and principal \"where the evidence points to an exclusionary offense which dictates \r\n  that different proof is required as to each defendant.\" State v. Good, \r\n  315 S.C. 135, 139, 432 S.E.2d 463, 466 (1993). For instance, in Collins I, \r\n  supra, the Court determined the defendant was entitled to an accessory \r\n  before the fact charge when he was in jail at the time of the felony and therefore \r\n  could only be guilty of accessory before the fact. In State v. Leonard, \r\n  292 S.C. 133, 355 S.E.2d 270 (1987), where co-defendants were charged with reckless \r\n  homicide arising from the operation of a motor vehicle, the Court held because \r\n  only one person could be the driver of the vehicle, a charge distinguishing \r\n  principal and accomplice liability was required. On the other hand, in State \r\n  v. Gates, 269 S.C. 557, 238 S.E.2d 680 (1977), the Court ruled the defendant \r\n  who drove the getaway car but did not enter the convenience store during the \r\n  robbery was not entitled to an accessory after the fact charge. The Court noted \r\n  there is \"a factual distinction between a crime where the defendant was physically \r\n  unable to participate and one where the defendant acted as the 'getaway' driver.\" \r\n  State v. Good, supra S.C. at 137, S.E.2d at 465. One authority \r\n  explains \"[b]y 'exclusionary offense' the Court means an offense which by law, \r\n  or by the facts of the case, could have been committed by only one principal \r\n  first.\" (2) William Shepard McAninch, The Criminal \r\n  Law of South Carolina, 369 (1996). \r\n\r\nIn Good, supra, the Court noted the \r\n  reason for precluding an accessory instruction when an exclusionary offense \r\n  does not exist:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf accessory after the fact is not charged in the indictment, but is instructed to clarify mere presence, a finding of accessory after the fact is the equivalent to a\r\nfinding of not guilty.  The real impact of the instruction is that it permits the jury to reach a compromise verdict on a non-charged offense.  Moreover, to require\r\nan accessory instruction on these facts opens the door for every criminal defendant to create a lesser-included offense for which they could not be convicted.  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. S.C. at 138, S.E.2d at 465. \r\n\r\nAppellant was not entitled to a charge on accessory \r\n  after the fact. First, he was not entitled to the charge because he was not \r\n  indicted as an accessory and accessory after the fact is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense to murder. Second, the evidence did not eliminate appellant as a principal \r\n  first. To the contrary, appellant admitted being present during the stabbing. \r\n  Unlike the co-defendants in State v. Leonard, supra, and Collins \r\n  I, supra, appellant could have participated in victim's murder as \r\n  a principal to the same extent as Johnson and Murphy. (3) \r\n  If the jury believed appellant's claims that he had no knowledge of Johnson \r\n  and Murphy's plan to kill victim and that he was asleep when victim was attacked, \r\n  appellant would have been acquitted of murder. \r\n\r\nThis case is similar to State v. Good, supra, \r\n  where two brothers were charged with double homicide. Each brother claimed the \r\n  other committed the murders while he was outside the family's camper. The Court \r\n  held there was no error in refusing to charge accessory after the fact because \r\n  \"there is no exclusionary situation which eliminates one brother or the other \r\n  from having participated in the murder as the principal.\" Id. S.C. at \r\n  139, S.E.2d at 466.\r\n\r\nThe remaining issue is affirmed pursuant to Rule \r\n  220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: State v. Franklin, 299 \r\n  S.C. 133, 382 S.E.2d 911 (1989) (charge on accomplice liability substantially \r\n  covered language requested by defendant); State v. Barwick, 280 S.C. \r\n  45, 310 S.E.2d 428 (1983) (jury charge is adequate if it fully and fairly covers \r\n  the substance of the requested charge); State v. Haney, 257 S.C. 89, \r\n  184 S.E.2d 344 (1971) (refusal to give requested charge not error where requested \r\n  charge merely rephrases and repeats principles expounded in given charge); State \r\n  v. Clary, 222 S.C. 549, 73 S.E.2d 681 (1952) (no error in refusing to charge \r\n  the precise language requested where jury is correctly instructed in accord \r\n  with the requested charge). \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.    \r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J. concurring in result only.\r\n1. In his closing statement, appellant suggested he could be guilty of accessory after the fact to murder but should be acquitted of murder.    \r\n2. A \"principal first\" is one \r\n  who actually does the felonious act or who causes the felonious act to be committed \r\n  by an innocent agent such as a child or insane person. State v. Posey, \r\n  35 S.C.L. (4 Strob.) 142 (1849). \r\n3. Johnson and Murphy were also indicted for murder.  Murphy pled guilty to accessory after the fact.  The record does not indicate the disposition of Johnson's\r\ncharges.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25336","title":"In the Matter of Jefferson M.

Long, Jr., regarding two client matters and his guilty plea in federal court. \r\n  Respondent was placed on interim suspension on July 22, 1999. In re Long, 335 \r\n  S.C. 584, 518 S.E.2d 264 (1999). Respondent did not answer the formal charges \r\n  and was not present at the hearing. However, in a letter to the Court dated \r\n  December 5, 2000, he acknowledged the pending disciplinary charges and admitted \r\n  the infractions alleged against him. In the letter, respondent sought to tender \r\n  his resignation from the practice of law.\r\n\r\nCriminal Conviction\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent pled guilty to one count of violating Section 1001 of Title 18 of the United States Code by knowingly and willfully\r\nmaking a false statement of a material fact in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States. \r\nRespondent's plea arose out the federal sting operation \"Operation Lost Trust.\"\r\n\r\nClient A Matter\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Respondent was retained to represent Client A in a criminal matter. Despite \r\n  Client A's requests, respondent failed to perfect an appeal as required by Rule \r\n  602, SCACR, and In re Anonymous Member of the Bar, 303 S.C. 306, 400 S.E.2d \r\n  483 (1991). (1) Client A also repeatedly requested \r\n  his file; however, respondent delayed for an unreasonable amount of time before \r\n  releasing the file. Respondent failed to properly communicate with Client A \r\n  regarding his conviction and appeal.\r\n\r\nClient B Matter\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Respondent was retained to represent Client B in a criminal matter. Despite \r\n  Client B's requests, respondent failed to perfect an appeal as required by Rule \r\n  602, SCACR, and In re Anonymous Member of the Bar, 303 S.C. 306, 400 S.E.2d \r\n  483 (1991). Respondent incorrectly advised Client B that he had no grounds for \r\n  appeal and failed to properly communicate with Client B regarding his conviction \r\n  and appeal.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  The authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline \r\n  is given rests entirely with the Supreme Court. E.g., In re Yarborough, 337 \r\n  S.C. 245, 524 S.E.2d 100 (1999). Because respondent failed to answer the formal \r\n  charges against him, this failure constitutes an admission of the factual allegations. \r\n  See Rule 24(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Consequently, we need only determine \r\n  the appropriate sanction for respondent. See In re Rast, 337 S.C. 588, 524 S.E.2d \r\n  619 (1999); In re Thornton, 327 S.C. 193, 489 S.E.2d 198 (1997).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Respondent violated several Rules of Professional Conduct by: (1) failing to \r\n  provide competent representation; (2) failing to abide by a client's decisions \r\n  regarding the scope of representation; (3) failing to diligently represent a \r\n  client; (4) failing to properly communicate with a client; (5) failing to safekeep \r\n  a client's property; (6) improperly terminating representation of a client; \r\n  (7) failing to properly serve as an advisor to a client; and (8) violating the \r\n  rules of professional conduct; (9) committing a criminal act reflecting adversely \r\n  on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; \r\n  (10) engaging in conduct involving moral turpitude; (11) engaging in conduct \r\n  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and (12) engaging \r\n  in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. See Rules 1.1,1.2, \r\n  1.3, 1.4, 1.15, 1.16, 2.1, &amp; 8.4, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Additionally, respondent violated the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement \r\n  by: (1) violating the Rules of Professional Conduct; (2) failing to respond \r\n  to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority; (3) being convicted of a serious \r\n  crime; (4) engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating \r\n  an unfitness to practice law; and (5) violating the oath of office taken upon \r\n  admission to practice law in this state. See Rule 7(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  In other disciplinary cases involving criminal convictions stemming from \"Operation \r\n  Lost Trust\" we have imposed both a definite and an indefinite suspension. See \r\n  In re Ferguson, 314 S.C. 278, 443 S.E.2d 905 (1994) (indefinite suspension); \r\n  In re Limehouse, 307 S.C. 278, 414 S.E.2d 783 (1992) (indefinite suspension); \r\n  In re Crow, 308 S.C. 128, 417 S.E.2d 534 (1992) (six-month definite suspension). \r\n  We find that respondent's criminal conviction relating to \"Operation Lost Trust\" \r\n  and his misconduct in the two client matters warrant the sanction of a two-year \r\n  definite suspension. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, respondent is definitely suspended from the practice of law for two years, retroactive to the date of his interim\r\nsuspension.  We will reconsider respondent's letter of resignation at the end of the definite suspension.  Furthermore, we order\r\nrespondent to pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct within 30 days of the date of\r\nthis opinion.  Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court, within 15 days of the date of this opinion, showing that he\r\nhas complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the case of In re Anonymous, \r\n  the issue was whether an attorney, retained for purposes of a criminal trial \r\n  only, must assist his client in perfecting an appeal. The Court held that where \r\n  the client desires an appeal, the attorney must serve and file the Notice of \r\n  Appeal to protect the client's right to appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
