Jackson, Jr., of Yarborough Hutto &amp; Jackson, of Orangeburg, for Guardian Ad\r\nLitem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This case was certified for review from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â Â  This appeal arises from an order of the probate court restricting Will Ulmer (Respondent) from visiting his mother, Anne Ulmer (Mrs. Ulmer).Â  During the appeal of a separate issue, Respondent made a motion to the circuit court to modify the probate courtâ€™s visitation order.Â  The circuit court granted the motion.Â  Jane Ulmer Patrick (Appellant), successor trustee and conservator for Mrs. Ulmer, appeals.Â  We reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order modifying the probate courtâ€™s visitation order.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nMrs. Ulmer served as trustee for a trust established upon the death of her husband for the benefit of her grandson.Â  She was to receive income from the trust during her lifetime.Â  Upon Mrs. Ulmerâ€™s death, the trust was to terminate and the trust property distributed to her grandson.Â  \r\nIn September of 2000, Respondent was appointed as Attorney in Fact for Mrs. Ulmer.Â  However, Respondent was replaced in February of 2003 after Mrs. Ulmer filed a petition to determine if Respondent had committed a breach of his fiduciary duties by selling timber located on the trust property and by removing money from savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and her safe deposit box.Â Â  Subsequently, the court named Appellant as Mrs. Ulmerâ€™s guardian and conservator.\r\nOn April 21, 2004, the probate court found that Respondent had breached his fiduciary duties and ordered that he pay $91,490.87 in restitution.Â Â  The probate court order also provided that Respondent was not to visit Mrs. Ulmer until he was contacted by Appellant at Mrs. Ulmerâ€™s request.Â  Respondent did not appeal this order. \r\nOn October 15, 2004, the probate court held Respondent in contempt of court for failing to pay the restitution due the trust.Â  Additionally, in the contempt order, the probate court allocated the repayment and ordered Respondent to replant timber on some of the properties.Â  Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  On December 3, 2004, the probate court denied the motion and ordered that Respondent be imprisoned until he complied with the courtâ€™s orders or for thirty days, whichever occurred first.Â  \r\nAfter the court denied Respondentâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment of the contempt order, Respondent filed a notice of appeal.Â  Respondent later amended the notice of appeal, limiting the issues on appeal to the probate courtâ€™s contempt orders dated October 15, 2004 and December 3, 2004.Â  On February 9, 2005, Respondent filed a motion in circuit court for permission to visit Mrs. Ulmer.Â  The circuit court granted the motion on the limited ground that Respondent be allowed one supervised visit with Mrs. Ulmer.Â  This appeal followed, wherein Appellant raises the following issues for review: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the circuit court err in ordering a change in visitation because the matter was not preserved for review?[1]\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         If this Court finds the matter is preserved for review, did the circuit court err in ordering visitation because the facts do not support a modification of the probate courtâ€™s order?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw and Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue Preservation \r\nAppellant contends the circuit court erred in ordering a change in visitation because the matter was not preserved for review.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Probate Code governs appeals from the probate court.Â  Under the Probate Code, final orders or decrees of the probate court may be appealed to the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann Â§ 62-1-308(a) (Supp. 2005).Â  In reviewing an appeal from the probate court, the circuit court must apply the same rules of law as an appellate court would apply.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(d); In re Estate of Pallister, 363 S.C. 437, 447, 611 S.E.2d 250, 256 (2005).Â  Accordingly, because the circuit court has appellate jurisdiction only, it has no power to hear new evidence in reviewing a probate matter.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(d); In re Estate of Howard, 315 S.C 356, 360, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993).Â  \r\nAn appellate court will not consider issues on appeal which have not been preserved for appellate review.Â  In the Interest of Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (holding that issues must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court to be preserved for appellate review). Â When an appellate court rules on an issue not preserved for appellate review, the portion of the appellate courtâ€™s opinion pertaining to the unpreserved issue should be vacated.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003).Â Â  \r\nFurther, the circuit court has appellate jurisdiction over only those matters which are properly appealed.Â  In re Cretzmeyer, 365 S.C. 12, 14, 615 S.E.2d 116, 116 (2005).Â  â€œA portion of a judgment that is not appealed presents no issue for determination by the reviewing court and constitutes, rightly or wrongly, the law of the case.â€Â  Austin v. Specialty\r\nTransp. Servc., 358 S.C. 298, 320, 594 S.E.2d 867, 878 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Therefore, even where the error has been preserved at the trial level, the party must make timely service of the notice of appeal to present the issue to the appellate court for review. Â 15 S.C. Jur. Appeal and Error Â§ 71 (2005).Â  \r\nIn this case, the probate court initially ruled upon the issue of visitation in its April 21, 2004 order.Â  The second order of the probate court, entered October 15, 2004, concerned only the contempt proceedings instituted against Respondent.Â Â  Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration in the probate court with regard to the second order finding him in contempt.Â  However, at no time did Respondent petition the probate court to modify the visitation order. Â After the probate court denied Respondentâ€™s motion for reconsideration in its December 3, 2004 order, Respondent filed an appeal with the circuit court.Â  Respondent later amended the notice of appeal, limiting the issues to the probate courtâ€™s October and December orders only.Â  \r\nWe find that the circuit court could not modify the visitation order of the probate court because the issue of visitation was not preserved for review.Â  Respondent did not make a post trial motion to the probate court regarding visitation, nor did he petition the probate court for modification of its visitation order.Â  Therefore, the trial court was not given an opportunity to rule on the issue before the issue was raised in the appellate court.Â  For that reason, the circuit court erred in changing the visitation order because the circuit court could review only those matters which were properly preserved for review.\r\nAdditionally, we find that by amending the notice of appeal, limiting the issues to the probate courtâ€™s October 2004 and December 2004 orders only, Respondent failed to appeal the April 2004 order limiting visitation.Â Â  Accordingly, even if the issue had been preserved, the circuit court erred in modifying the visitation order, no appeal having been taken from the April 2004 order.\r\nRespondent contends the circuit court properly heard the motion to modify the visitation order because the probate court was divested of its jurisdiction over the entire matter under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(c).[2]Â  Respondent misunderstands the statute.Â  Section 62-1-308(c) does not apply to all orders of the probate court concerning the parties.Â  The only proceedings required to cease are those proceedings addressed in the orders from which an appeal was taken.Â  Accordingly, Respondentâ€™s reliance on Â§ 62-1-308(c) is misplaced.Â  Therefore, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order modifying visitation.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modification of Visitation\r\nAppellant argues that if the matter was preserved for review, the facts do not support a change in visitation. Â Because the Court finds that the matter was not preserved for review or properly appealed, we do not address this issue.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the circuit court erred in modifying the visitation order of the probate court.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order granting visitation is reversed.Â  \r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Brooks P. Goldsmith, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n[1] Both Appellant and Respondent frame the issue on appeal in terms of the â€œjurisdictionâ€ of the circuit court.Â  â€œThe concept of\r\njurisdiction refers to the authority of a court over a particular person (personal jurisdiction) or the authority of a court to entertain a particular action (subject matter jurisdiction).â€Â  Boan v. Jacobs, 296 S.C. 419, 421, 373 S.E.2d 697, 698 (Ct. App. 1988) (citations omitted).Â  Â This case involves whether the issue reviewed by the circuit court was properly appealed and preserved for appellate review, not the circuit courtâ€™s power to hear appeals from the probate court.Â  \r\n[2] Section 62-1-308(c) reads, â€œ[w]hen an appeal according to law is taken from any sentence or decree of the probate court, all proceedings in pursuance of the order, sentence, or decree appealed from shall cease until the judgment of the circuit court, court of appeals, or Supreme Court is had. If the appellant, in writing, waives his appeal before the entry of the judgment, proceedings may be had in the probate court as if no appeal had been taken.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26178","title":"Goldman v.

Edward Bell, III, of Sumter, for Petitioner.\r\nKristi F. Curtis, of Sumter, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  RBC, Inc. (Petitioner) challenges the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision affirming the circuit court judgeâ€™s ruling quieting title to a strip of land containing an abandoned railway in David W. Goldman and Emilie E. Goldman (the Goldmans).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1846, the General Assembly, anxious to encourage the building of railroads, granted a liberal charter by statute to the Wilmington &amp; Manchester Railroad Company.Â  In provisions typically seen in railroad charters of that era, the railroad was empowered to obtain land on which to lay track by buying it and receiving a deed; condemning it through the formal process of eminent domain; or through a statutory presumption of grant by which the railroad would simply lay track where it wished and then, if the owner asserted his rights within ten years after completion, pay the owner a fair market price for the land.Â  Act No. 2986, 1846 S.C. Acts 402, Â§Â§ XVI and XVII.Â  It is the third method which is at issue in the present case, and it is undisputed the owner of the land at the time of construction never sought compensation from the railroad by 1863, ten years after this section of track was completed.[1]  \r\nCSX Transportation (CSX), the successor in interest to the Wilmington &amp; Manchester and several other railroad companies which have used this particular track since 1863, in 1994 abandoned a 16.1-mile stretch of track between Lynchburg and Sumter through a process overseen by the former Interstate Commerce Commission.Â  In 1995, Petitioner paid $104,000 to obtain a quitclaim deed from CSX for a 1.19-mile portion of the abandoned track, which it intended to use to bring railroad tankers to its location.Â  Petitioner manufactures and installs non-sparking agitation equipment used in railroad tankers.Â  \r\nThe Goldmans own a 190-acre farm through which a portion of the 1.19-mile track passes.Â  The track is located across a pond about 100 yards from their home, which they built in 1992.Â  Before the unanticipated sale to Petitioner, the Goldmans planned to buy the strip of land from CSX after abandonment in order to avoid litigation over its ownership and they contacted CSX to discuss a sale.\r\nAfter CSX sold the land to Petitioner, the Goldmans sued Petitioner in 1998 to quiet title in themselves as adjoining landowners in the strip of land, totaling about four acres, which passes through their farm.Â  The circuit court, on cross-motions for summary judgment ruled in favor of the Goldmans and ordered that fee simple title is held by the\r\nGoldmans.&nbsp; \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Goldman v. RBC, Inc., Op. No. 2004-UP-362 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 4, 2004) (unpublished opinion).Â  We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari to consider the following issue:\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in rejecting Petitionerâ€™s argument that a ruling which quieted title in the Goldmans conflicts with Lewis v. Wilmington &amp; Manchester Railroad Company, 45 S.C.L. (11 Rich.) 91 (1857)?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to remove a cloud on and to quiet title to land is one in equity.Â  Johnson v. Arbabi, 355 S.C. 64, 68, 584 S.E.2d 113, 115 (2003).Â  In an action in equity tried by a judge alone, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 276, 457 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1995); Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). Â However, this broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard the findings made below.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 279 S.E.2d 616 (1981).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001).Â  In reviewing a summary judgment motion, the appellate courts apply the same standards as the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 145 (1991).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in declining to follow the view Petitioner believes was expressed in Lewis v. Wilmington &amp; Manchester Railroad Company, 45 S.C.L. (11 Rich.) 91 (1857).Â  Petitioner contends the Goldmans are forever barred by statute from recovering the disputed land because their predecessors in interest failed to file for an assessment by 1863, ten years after completion of the railroad.Â  CSXâ€™s predecessor obtained fee simple title to the property at that time, which was confirmed by this Court in Lewis and consequently became a property right which could not be divested by later developments in the law.Â  Specifically, Petitioner relies on the statement in Lewis that â€œif application for an assessment is not made within ten years after the completion of the road, the owner is forever barred from recovering the land or having an assessment, which manifests the intention of the legislature to divest the ownerâ€™s title. . . .â€Â  Id. at 94.Â  Therefore, the Wilmington &amp; Manchester Railroad obtained a fee simple title, meaning CSX, as successor in interest, was able to transfer a fee simple title in the land to Petitioner in 1995.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn several cases, we have considered the following issue:Â  When a previous landowner did not assert his ownership rights and force the railroad to buy the land within a specified period after completion of the tracks pursuant to a statutory presumption of a land grant contained in a railroad charter, did the railroad (A) obtain an easement across the land as long as it was used as a railroad, with the property reverting to present adjoining landowners when no longer used as a railroad or (B) obtain title to the land in fee simple absolute, giving the railroadâ€™s successor in interest the ability to transfer a fee simple title to the land?Â  We repeatedly have held that the answer to this question is (A).[2]  \r\nMost recently, in Faulkenberry v. Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., 349 S.C. 318, 563 S.E.2d 644 (2002), the railroad argued it held a fee simple determinable estate in a 200-foot wide strip of land underlying the tracks, which its predecessor had obtained by a statutory presumption of grant provision in an 1845 railroad charter very similar to the one in the present case.Â  We rejected the railroadâ€™s arguments in Faulkenberry, several of which are echoed by Petitioner in the present case.Â  Citing several cases dating back to 1882, we held the railroad had only an easement as long as the land was used as a railroad, not a fee simple determinable estate.Â  Id. at 325, 563 S.E.2d at 645; accord Boney v. Cornwell, 117 S.C. 426, 435, 109 S.E. 271, 274 (1921) (in deciding boundary dispute implicating charter by which railroad obtained land by statutory presumption of grant, Court cited several cases in which it â€œhas distinctly held that the [railroad] company thereby acquired, not the fee, but an easement of right of wayâ€); Hill v. Southern Ry., 67 S.C. 548, 552-53, 46 S.E. 486, 487 (1903) (railroad holds an easement of right of way across land obtained by statutory presumption of grant); Southern Ry. v. Beaudrot, 63 S.C. 266, 41 S.E. 299 (1902) (railroad, which obtained easement of right of way by statutory presumption of grant, may bring action to force adjoining landowner to remove fence from area encompassed by easement); Ragsdale v. Southern Ry. Co., 60 S.C. 381, 389, Â 38 S.E. 609, 612 (1901) (in dispute over use of buildings located next to railroad, Court held that railroad, when it obtains easement of right of way by statutory presumption of grant, obtains only an easement so long as it is used for railroad purposes, not title in fee simple absolute); Waring v. Cheraw &amp; Darlington R.R. Co., 16 S.C. 416, 423 (1882) (interpreting the Wilmington &amp; Manchester charter and finding that when railroad obtains easement of right of way by statutory presumption of grant due to ownerâ€™s failure to move for assessment during specified period, railroad then has â€œright to enjoy the slip occupied by [it] so long as [railroad] continued to use it for [its] roadâ€); Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 417-18, 503 S.E.2d 191, 201 (Ct. App. 1998) (interpreting statutory presumption of grant language in railroad charter and explaining that â€œample South Carolina Supreme Court precedent has defined the Railroadâ€™s interest in [such cases] as an easement onlyâ€).\r\nWe reaffirm the position we took in Faulkenberry and the earlier cases.Â  This result reconciles the seemingly conflicting provisions of Section XVII of the statutory charter.[3]Â  Furthermore, this position represents the wiser choice on public policy grounds because it avoids unnecessary disputes between numerous past landholders and their heirs over ownership of small strips of land.\r\nWe take this opportunity to clarify Lewis, the case on which Petitioner primarily relies.Â  The Lewis Court did not directly address the issue at hand and that opinion is neither controlling nor dispositive.Â  The issue presented in Lewis was whether a grantee of the person who held the land when the railroad originally was built could seek compensation from the railroad before expiration of the ten-year period.Â  \r\nThe Lewis Court held the later grantee could not seek compensation, and in doing so indicated in passing that â€œif application for an assessment is not made within ten years after the completion of the road, the owner is forever barred from recovering the land or having an assessment, which manifests the intention of the legislature to divest the ownerâ€™s title, reserving to him the right to claim the purchase money or compensation alone. . . .â€Â  Id. at 94 (emphasis added).Â  We view the emphasized language, relied upon by Petitioner, as dicta or an inapt remark which does not support Petitionerâ€™s argument.Â  It plainly was not the ownerâ€™s title which was divested after ten years under these circumstances, but his right to seek compensation from the railroad.Â  As the Lewis Court observed, â€œ[i]t is not the land, but the right to compensation that is involved in this controversy. . . .â€Â  Lewis, 45 S.C.L. at 94.Â  In short, the Lewis Court did not decide whether the railroad, after obtaining land by statutory presumption of grant, held only an easement or title in fee simple because the Court was not faced with that issue.Â  The easement-versus-fee-simple issue arose later and was resolved as explained in Faulkenberry and the cited cases.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reaffirm our previous holdings and conclude that when a previous landowner did not assert his ownership rights and force the railroad to buy the land within a specified period after completion of the tracks pursuant to a statutory presumption of a land grant contained in a railroad charter, the railroad obtained an easement across the land as long as it was used as a railroad, with the property reverting to present adjoining landowners when no longer used as a railroad.Â  We reject an interpretation of Lewis, 45 S.C.L. 91, which conflicts with this established proposition.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the\r\nGoldmans.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice D. Garrison Hill, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Section XVII of the railroadâ€™s charter prescribed the method by which the railroad acquired land by statutory presumption of grant:\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any contract or contracts with the said company, in relation to land through which the said road may pass, signed by the owner thereof, or by his agent, or any claimant or person in possession thereof, which may be confirmed by the owner thereof, it shall be presumed that the land upon which the road may be constructed, together with a space of sixty-five feet on each side of the center of the said road, has been granted to the company by the owner or owners thereof, and the said company shall have good right and title thereto, and shall have, hold and enjoy the same, as long as the same may be used only for the purposes of the said road, and no longer, unless the person or persons owning the said land, at the time that the part of the said road which may be on the said land, was finished, or those claiming under him, her or them, shall apply for an assessment of the value of the said lands, as hereinafter directed, within ten years next after the said part was finished; and in the case the said owner or owners, or those claiming under him, her or them, shall not apply for such assessment within ten years next after the said road is finished, he, she, or they shall be forever barred from recovering the said land, or having any assessment or compensation therefore; provided, Nothing herein contained shall effect the rights of feme coverts or infants, until two years after the removal of their respective disabilities.\r\n\r\nAct No. 2986, 1846 S.C. Acts 402, Â§ XVII.Â  The emphasized portions of the charter highlight the language which has given rise to issues presented in this railway abandonment case and earlier, similar cases. \r\n[2]Â  When the railroad paid for the land, whether by deed transfer, condemnation, or after an owner asserted his right to payment, the railroad obtained a fee simple title.Â  Waring v. Cheraw &amp; Darlington R.R. Co., 16 S.C. 416, 423 (1882) (citing Lewis dissent for proposition that â€œif compensation should be claimed and paid [by the railroad], the fee-simple absolute would thereby be vested in the [railroad] companyâ€); Ragsdale v. Southern Ry.

Jordan, of York, for Petitioner.\r\nLeland Bland Greeley, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: The court of appeals held that the State failed to provide probable cause that the property sought to be forfeited was traceable to illegal drug activity.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nIn 1996, William Edward Gordon, Jr. (Respondent) was arrested for trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  At the time of his arrest, Respondent owned a car cleaning and detailing business named Gordonâ€™s Car Cleaning Service.Â  The primary customers of the service were automobile dealerships and individuals.Â  \r\nThe Rock Hill Police Department arrested Respondent during a 1996 investigation.Â  The Police Departmentâ€™s investigation of Respondent began in 1994.Â  In January of 1994, the Police Department conducted a controlled buy of illegal drugs from Respondent.Â  In February of 1994, the Police Department obtained a search warrant for Respondentâ€™s home and recovered crack cocaine and marijuana.Â  While conducting an additional search at Respondentâ€™s home, the Police Department discovered crack cocaine in a well house near the home.Â  Respondent plead guilty to possession of marijuana which was recovered during the 1994 investigation.\r\nIn September of 1996, the Police Department began a second investigation of Respondent following the arrest of another crack dealer in the Rock Hill area who identified Respondent as the supplier.Â  In addition, the same person identified Tommy Rhinehart (Rhinehart) as a dealer.Â  \r\nRhinehart agreed to cooperate with the Police Department after he was arrested for possession of crack cocaine and other narcotics.Â  The undisputed facts outlined by the court of appeals relating the sting operation are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe next day, Rhinehart met with Gordon to discuss future transactions.Â  During the course of the conversation, Rhinehart told Gordon that he had â€œflushedâ€ the crack cocaine during the Department's search of his residence.Â  On September 26, 1996, Gordon and his nephew, Spencer, gave Rhinehart another bag of crack cocaine. Â Spencer stayed with Rhinehart while he sold some of the crack cocaine. Â On September 27, 1996, Rhinehart met with agents and turned over the proceeds from the sale and the remaining crack cocaine. Â At that time, the agents gave Rhinehart $500 in marked money to pay Gordon for the crack cocaine that he had â€œfrontedâ€ him. Â In a recorded conversation, Rhinehart set up another transaction with Gordon. Gordon indicated that he needed to contact\r\nSpencer. &nbsp;Rhinehart was then instructed to meet Spencer at Gordon's car wash. Â At the car wash, Spencer gave Rhinehart two bags of crack cocaine, weighing 9.4 grams and 9.8 grams respectively, and collected $500 for a previous transaction. Â Rhinehart then left, met with the agents, and turned over the crack cocaine.\r\n\r\n  On September 30, 1996, Rhinehart paged Gordon to arrange a meeting time so that he could pay for the two additional bags of crack cocaine.\r\nThe agents gave Rhinehart $1,000 in marked money and equipped him with a surveillance wire. Â Rhinehart met with Spencer at a designated location. Â He then gave Spencer the money received from the sale of the crack cocaine that was purchased earlier from Gordon. Spencer left and told Rhinehart he would return with more crack cocaine. Â Spencer met Gordon, who was driving the pickup truck, at the car wash. Â Spencer left the car wash, drove to NationsBank, and made a deposit.Â  Shortly thereafter, agents arrested Spencer and searched him. Â The agents found a bank deposit receipt for account number 790167308, the business account for Gordon's car wash. Â The balance of the account was $22,209.85, which included the deposit.\r\n\r\n  During the same time period, Gordon was arrested while driving his pickup truck. Â He was found to be in possession of two cellular phones as well as $1,584 in cash, $880 of which was law enforcement funds given to Spencer earlier by Rhinehart. Â Pursuant to this arrest, the State seized the following\r\nproperty: the NationsBank operating account of Gordon's car wash business, $22,209.85 plus $726.24 from the payroll account; the $1,584 in cash; the pickup truck; and two cellular phones.\r\n\r\n  The forfeiture action also included seizures of cash in the amount of $821 and $128. Â On September 29, 1996, agents seized $821 in cash from Gordon when he was arrested on unrelated warrants during the search of another person's residence. Â On October 5, 1996, Gordon was arrested for obstruction of justice. Â While Rhinehart was wearing a surveillance wire, Gordon offered him $5,000 to leave town and not testify against him. Â At the time of the arrest, the agents seized $128 in cash from Gordon.\r\n\r\nPope v. Gordon, 359 S.C. 572, 598 S.E.2d 288 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â Â  \r\nUltimately, Respondent was convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment and payment of a $50,000 fine.Â  The State then filed this forfeiture action, seeking to confirm the seizures made as a result of this investigation were proceeds of illegal drug activity.\r\nThe circuit court ordered that all seized property, with the exception of $128 in â€œmarkedâ€ cash be returned to Respondent.Â  The court found that the State failed to meet its burden of showing probable cause that there was a nexus between the illegal drug activity and the property sought to be forfeited.Â  The State appealed and the court of appeals affirmed.Â  As a result, the State sought and this Court granted certiorari to review the following issue:\r\n\r\nDid the court of appeals err in holding that the State failed to establish probable cause that the property sought to be forfeited was traceable to illegal drug transactions?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nAn action for forfeiture of property is a civil action at law.Â  State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machs., 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate court standard of review extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  Okatie River,\r\nL.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 577 S.E.2d 468 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless the findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an erroneous conception of the application of the law.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co., 342 S.C. 152, 536 S.E.2d 376 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nThe State argues that the court of appeals erred in holding that the State failed to establish probable cause that the property sought to be forfeited was traceable to illegal drug transactions.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe purpose of a forfeiture hearing is to confirm that the state had probable cause to seize the property forfeited.Â  Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee VIN 1JCWB782FT129001, 322 S.C. 127, 131, 470 S.E.2d 373, 376 (1996).Â  The State has the initial burden of demonstrating probable cause for the belief that a substantial connection exists between the property to be forfeited and the criminal activity defined by statute.Â  United States v. Thomas, 913 F.2d 1111, 1114 (4th Cir.1990) (quoting Boas v. Smith, 786 F.2d 605, 609 (4th Cir.1986)).Â  If probable cause is shown, the burden then shifts to the owner to prove that he or she was not a consenting party to, or privy to, or did not have knowledge of, the use of the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture.Â  Medlock, 322 S.C. at 131, 470 S.E.2d at 376 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-586(b)(1) (2002)).\r\nThe relevant statute outlines that the following are subject to forfeiture in part:\r\n\r\nall property including, but not limited to, monies, negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance, and all proceeds including, but not limited to, monies, and real and personal property traceable to any exchange.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-520(a)(7) (2002).\r\nThe State urges this Court to adopt the rationale of the Fourth Circuit employed in U.S. v. Thomas.Â  913 F.2d 1111 (4th Cir. 1990).[1]Â  While, the court in Thomas outlined the proper standard in a forfeiture action, the court employed a â€œtotality of the circumstancesâ€ approach in finding that proceeds were traceable to illegal drug activity.Â  Thomas, 913 F.2d at 1114-1115.Â  The court noted the significance of the evidence presented, namely the possession of unusually large amounts of cash, or the making of uncommonly large purchases that may be circumstantial evidence of drug trafficking.Â  Thomas, 913 F.2d at 1115.Â  The court further relied on the fact that it appeared that Thomasâ€™s cash expenditures exceeded any verifiable income in determining that the totality of the circumstances pointed to income derived from illegal drug activity.Â  Id.Â  As a result, the State urges this Court to view the evidence â€œas a total pictureâ€ and to employ a â€œpractical, common senseâ€ approach in determining that the probabilities point to the proceeds being derived from illegal drug transactions.Â  See Thomas, 913 F.2d at 1114-1115.\r\nIn the present case, the State presented several witnesses who testified regarding Respondentâ€™s finances.Â  Christine Rogers, an employee of a property management company, testified she became acquainted with Respondent in 1995 or 1996 when she rented him an apartment\r\nin Rock Hill. Â In 1996, Respondent entered into a commercial lease agreement for the purchase of property. Â The terms of the agreement required Respondent to provide a $6,000 down payment and then a $750 monthly lease payment.Â  According to Rogers, Respondent paid cash for monthly rent for his apartment as well as the $6,000 down payment.\r\nThe State also presented, John Comer, a South Carolina Department of Revenue employee.Â  Comer testified the Department had no tax records for Respondent individually or for the car wash during the years of 1995 or 1996. Â Further, the State offered the testimony of Margaret Parsons, an accountant, who began assisting Respondent with his finances beginning in May or June 1996.Â  Based on her review of Respondentâ€™s finances, Parsons believed Respondentâ€™s expenses exceeded his business income and that the balance of the expenses was paid for in cash.\r\nIn addition to this testimony, the State presented Respondentâ€™s voluminous NationsBank records into evidence.Â  The record reflects that the NationsBankâ€™s documents contain extensive evidence that the bank accounts held legitimate business income, including checks from Rock Hill car dealerships.Â  However, the record is unclear whether the deposit ticket the State seized was evidence that Spencer deposited drug money or money from Respondentâ€™s car wash.Â  Furthermore, the State failed to show the withdrawals from the bank accounts were used to pay for items in cash as opposed to Respondent paying for these items directly from money gained from the sale of drugs.\r\nWe hold that the court of appeals correctly held that the State failed to meet its burden of proof.Â  The record shows that Respondent did have a legitimate car detailing business that involved cash transactions.Â  In addition, the bank records show that money in the accounts came from the car detailing business.Â  As a result, the State failed to demonstrate how the money contained in the bank account came from illegal drug transactions.Â  \r\nTherefore, we affirm the court of appeals opinion holding that the State failed to establish probable cause that the money in the bank accounts contained proceeds traceable to illegal drug transactions.Â  Further, we decline to use the rationale in Thomas because we believe the standard in Thomas would lessen the burden on the State and is in direct contravention to the word traceable in the language of the statute.Â  See Ducworth, 319 S.C. at 162, 459 S.E.2d at 899 (holding that the terms of a forfeiture statute must be strictly construed and as a result, the words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation).\r\nConclusion\r\nAccordingly, based on the above cited authority, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice D. Garrison Hill, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The federal forfeiture statute at issue in Thomas contains similar language to the state statute at issue in the present case.Â  See 21 U.S.C. Â§ 881(a)(6) (Supp. 2000).Â  However, we believe the language in the federal statute to be broader than that of our own state statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26180","title":"Kirkman v.

Parex, Inc., 356 S.C. 525, 590 S.E.2d 36 (Ct. App. 2003), in which the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Respondent First Union National Bank of South Carolina (First Union).Â  The Court of Appeals held that, as a matter of law, First Union did not impliedly warrant the habitability of the house that it sold to Petitioners Theodore and Karen Kirkman (the Kirkmans), and therefore could not be liable for breach of warranty.Â  We reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision and remand the case to the circuit court.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Kirkmans and Miller Housing Corporation (Miller Housing) executed a contract for the sale and purchase of a house.Â  First Union, which financed Miller Housingâ€™s construction of the house,[1] was listed in the contract â€œas principal lien holder.â€Â  \r\nWhen the contract was executed, Miller Housing was experiencing financial problems, and First Union was contemplating foreclosure.Â  The parties agreed that First Union would not foreclose on the property and that Miller Housingâ€™s debt would be satisfied by the Kirkmansâ€™ payment at closing.Â  It later became apparent that foreclosure was necessary because of junior liens on the property, which would not have been satisfied by the Kirkmansâ€™ payment.Â  Consequently, the parties amended the sales contract by omitting the provision barring foreclosure.Â  First Union then foreclosed and took title to the property.\r\nThe contract also included a clause requiring Miller Housing to complete the house prior to closing.Â  Unfortunately, Miller Housingâ€™s financial troubles caused it to go out of business, and it never completed the house.\r\nFirst Union, then the owner of the house, hired another contractor to finish the project.Â  There is evidence in the record that First Unionâ€™s contractor finished the heating and air systems and all of the hardwood floors; sub-contracted out some plumbing work; installed light fixtures and appliances; fixed the sheetrock walls; and painted at least some of the interior of the house.Â  It is undisputed, however, that First Unionâ€™s contractor did not install the artificial stucco which the Kirkmans claim was defective and rendered the house unhabitable.Â  Miller Housing had already performed that task.Â Â  \r\nNeither party has been able to locate any records showing the amount of money that First Union paid to the new contractor.Â  The only evidence comes from an employee of the contractor, who testified in his deposition that the work described above was performed and that it took a month and a half to two months to do it.Â  His best guess was that his company charged First Union between forty and fifty thousand dollars.Â  The First Union employee who was involved in the project testified in his deposition that he â€œwould not be able to denyâ€ that First Union spent that much money to complete the house.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter its contractor completed the house, First Union deeded the property to the Kirkmans.Â  In addition to the usual conveyance language and description of the property, the deed provided that First Union disclaimed the implied warranty of habitability and that the property was sold as-is.Â  According to the Kirkmans, they were unaware that the deed included the disclaimer and did not believe they were purchasing the house as-is.Â  \r\nWhen the Kirkmans tried to sell the property years later, they spent approximately forty-five thousand dollars to repair the artificial stucco on the exterior of the house.Â  They then brought this action, alleging that First Union, as the seller of the property, breached the implied warranty of habitability. \r\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment, and the circuit court granted it to First Union, finding as a matter of law that First Union was a â€œmere lenderâ€ and therefore did not impliedly warrant the habitability of the house.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.\r\n         Whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the grant of summary judgment on the ground that First Union was a â€œmere lender.â€\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the record contains an additional sustaining ground: that First Union effectively disclaimed the implied warranty of habitability.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard as the circuit court: summary judgment is appropriate â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Osborne, 346 S.C. at 7, 550 S.E.2d at 321.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nUnder the doctrine of caveat venditor, the seller of a new house impliedly warrants the habitability of the house.Â  Arvai v. Shaw, 289 S.C. 161, 345 S.E.2d 715 (1986) (holding that the warranty is implied only in the initial sale, not in a resale); Lane v. Trenholm Bldg. Co., 267 S.C. 497, 503, 229 S.E.2d 728, 730-31 (1976) (holding that, generally, the warranty is made by the seller even if he did not build the house); Rutledge v. Dodenhoff, 254 S.C. 407, 413-15, 175 S.E.2d 792, 795 (1970) (first recognizing the warranty).Â  The sellerâ€™s â€œliability is not founded upon fault, but because it has profited by receiving a fair price and, as between it and an innocent purchaser, the innocent purchaser should be protected from latent defects.â€Â  Lane, 267 S.C. at 503, 229 S.E.2d at 731.Â  â€œ[T]he warranty springs from the sale.Â  The determining factor is not whether the defendant actually builds the defective house, but that he places it, by the initial sale, into the stream of commerce.â€Â \r\nArvai, 289 S.C. at 164, 345 S.E.2d at 717.\r\nâ€œ[A] mere lender,â€ however, â€œeven if a party to the sale, is ordinarily not liable under an implied warranty of habitability theory.â€Â  Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber and Mfg. Co., 299 S.C. 335, 340, 384 S.E.2d 730, 734 (1989).Â  \r\n\r\n  This is not to say that a lender will never incur\r\nimplied warranty liability when it makes a sale after default. Obviously, a lender can be held\r\n  liable if it is also a developer. ... Liability may also attach when the lender becomes highly\r\n  involved with construction in a manner that isnot normal commercial practice for a lender.Â  In\r\n  such a situation, the lender might be said to be a joint venturer.&nbsp; The lender may be liable if it is so\r\n  amalgamated with the developer or builder so as to blur its legal distinction.Â  A lender may also be\r\n  liable where it forecloses on a developer in the midst of construction, takes title, has substantial\r\n  involvement in completing the construction and sells homes.[2]Â \r\n  \r\nId. at 340, 384 S.E.2d at 734 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nI.Â  Mere Lender\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that First Union was a mere lender as a matter of law and therefore did not impliedly warrant the habitability of the house purchased by the Kirkmans.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is clear that First Union was not a developer; that it was not in a joint venture with Miller Housing; and that it was not amalgamated with Miller Housing.Â  It is equally clear, however, that First Union foreclosed before construction was complete, took title to the property, and sold the house to the Kirkmans.Â  Contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeals, there remains a genuine issue of material fact whether First Union was substantially involved in completing the construction.Â  As stated above, there is evidence in the record that First Unionâ€™s contractor finished the heating and air systems and all of the hardwood floors; sub-contracted out plumbing work; installed light fixtures and appliances; fixed the sheetrock walls; and painted some or all of the interior of the house.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals focused on the Kirkmansâ€™ suggestion that the forty to fifty thousand dollars which First Union paid to complete the house was a substantial portion of the roughly two hundred and forty thousand dollars that constituted the total construction cost.Â  The court opined that the Kirkmans were arguing that substantial involvement was â€œto be determined solely by a mathematical approach.â€Â  Kirkman, 356 S.C. at 530-31, 590 S.E.2d at 39.Â  That is not the Kirkmansâ€™ argument.Â  They raise First Unionâ€™s expenditure only to emphasize their thesis that all of the work performed by First Unionâ€™s contractor over the course of two months was a substantial portion of the total work.Â  Â Â \r\nIn addition, the Court of Appeals improperly relied on Roundtree Villas and the fact that First Union â€œwas not involved in the installation of the [allegedly defective] stucco siding.â€Â  Kirkman, 356 S.C. at 531, 590 S.E.2d at 39.Â  As mentioned above in note 2, in Roundtree Villas we held that a lender could be liable for faulty construction with respect to those parts of the house on which it worked, but we specifically held that such liability would lie in tort, not contract.Â  See 282 S.C. at 423, 321 S.E.2d at 50-51. Â There was an issue in Roundtree Villas concerning a lenderâ€™s warranty liability, but our discussion of it was very brief.Â  We found that none of the defendants warranted the habitability of the house because none was a seller of the house.Â  Id. at 423, 321 S.E.2d at 51; see also Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 340, 384 S.E.2d at 734 (discussing the limited warranty holding in Roundtree Villas).Â  \r\nIn sum, there remains a genuine issue of material fact whether First Union was substantially involved in completing the house.Â  If it was, then it impliedly warranted the habitability of the house, unless it effectively disclaimed the warranty.\r\nII.Â  Disclaimer\r\nAs an additional sustaining ground, First Union argues that the grant of summary judgment should be affirmed because First Union disclaimed the implied warranty of habitability.Â  Whether the warranty can be disclaimed is a novel issue in South Carolina. \r\nWe agree with the Supreme Court of Alabama â€œthat the principle of freedom of contract permits a party to effectively disclaim the implied warranty of habitability.â€Â \r\nTurner v. Westhampton Court, L.L.C., 903 So.2d 82, 93 (Ala. 2004).Â  To maintain the protection of purchasers, however, disclaimer can be permitted only if strict conditions are satisfied.Â  We adopt the requirements set forth by the Washington Court of Appeals: the disclaimer â€œmust be (1) conspicuous, (2) known to the buyer, and (3) specifically bargained for.â€Â \r\nBurbo v. Harley C. Douglass, Inc., 106 P.3d 258, 263 (Wash. Ct. App. 2005).Â  This standard is to be applied strictly and will be met only in rare circumstances.Â  It will protect buyers but also give them freedom to purposefully bargain for a price discount or other desired benefit.Â  Denying buyers that freedom would be unduly paternalistic.Â Â  \r\nIn this case, the disclaiming language within the four corners of the deed does not, standing alone, lead to the conclusion that the standard we adopt was satisfied.Â  The circuit court needs to consider all relevant evidence in determining this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the grant of summary judgment to First Union and remand the case to the circuit court.Â  On remand, the following issues must be determined by the fact finder: whether First Union was substantially involved in completing the house sold to the Kirkmans; and whether First Union effectively disclaimed the implied warranty of habitability.Â  If First Union was so involved and did not effectively disclaim the warranty, then whether First Union breached the warranty will need to be determined.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, J., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr. and William P. Keesley, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The construction loan actually came from South Carolina Federal Savings Bank, which was later acquired by First Union.Â  For ease of discussion, we refer to the banks collectively as â€œFirst Union.â€\r\n[2] We take this opportunity to re-visit the following passage from Kennedy: \r\n  \r\n Roundtree Villas establishes liability on lenders for defects in those portions of the house(s) which\r\n they complete.Â  A lender will also incur liability for the performance of express representations made to\r\n a buyer.Â  A lender should be held responsible if it is aware of defects but conceals them from an unwitting buyer.Â  \r\n  \r\nKennedy, 299 S.C. at 340, 384 S.E.2d at 734 (parentheses in original) (internal citations omitted).\r\nUnder none of these scenarios would a lender expose itself to â€œimplied warranty liability.â€Â  First, a lenderâ€™s liability â€œfor defects in those portions of the house(s) which they completeâ€ is unrelated to the implied warranty of habitability.Â  As we specifically held in Roundtree Villas, such liability would be imposed under principles of tort law.Â  282 S.C. at 423, 321 S.E.2d at 50-51.Â  Second, by definition, an express representation does not constitute an implied warranty.Â  Third, the implied warranty of habitability does not spring from a lenderâ€™s engagement in fraudulent conduct; it springs from the sale of a new house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Theodore Edith v.

This order gave petitioner twenty days to show cause why the conditional order should not become final. Petitioner did not file a reply to the conditional order of dismissal, and the circuit court issued a final order of dismissal on March 6, 2006. Petitioner has now served and filed a notice of appeal from this last order.\r\n S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-70 (b) (2003) provides for conditional orders of dismissal in PCR actions. It states:\r\n\r\n  When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the application, the answer or motion, and the record, that the applicant is not entitled to post conviction relief and no purpose would be served by any further proceedings, it may indicate to the parties its intention to dismiss the application and its reasons for so doing. The applicant shall be given an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal. In light of the reply, or on default thereof, the court may order the application dismissed or grant leave to file an amended application or direct that the proceedings otherwise continue. Disposition on the pleadings and record is not proper if there exists a material issue of fact.\r\n\r\nThis Court has previously held that the issuance of a default judgment based on the failure of a party to file a response pleading or to appear is not appealable. Cf. Belue v. Belue, 276 S.C. 120, 276 S.E.2d 295 (1981)(default judgment based on failure to appear);Duncan v. Duncan, 93 S.C. 487, 76 S.E. 1099 (1913)(default judgment based on failure to file response pleading); Gadsden v. Home Fertilizer &amp; Chemical Co., 89 S.C. 483, 72 S.E. 15 (1911)(same); Gillian v. Gillian, 65 S.C. 129, 43 S.E. 386 (1903)(same); Washington v. Hesse, 56 S.C. 28, 33 S.E. 787 (1899)(same); Odom v. Burch, 52 S.C. 305, 29 S.E. 726 (1898)(same). We see no reason why this same rule should not be equally applicable to a PCR applicant who fails to avail himself of the opportunity to reply to a conditional order of dismissal and, as a result of this default, a final order of dismissal is issued.\r\nAccordingly, the notice of appeal in this matter is dismissed. The remittitur will be sent as provided by Rule 221, SCACR.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    s/Jean H.

(Trident) is a non-profit corporation whose members construct homes, and own and develop property within the town limits of respondent Town of Summerville (Town).Â  Trident commenced this action challenging Townâ€™s development impact fee ordinance which was enacted in 2003 pursuant to the South Carolina Development Impact Fee Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-1-910 et seq. (2004) (the Act).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Act defines a development impact fee as â€œa payment of money imposed as a condition of development approval to pay a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements needed to serve the people utilizing the improvements.â€Â  Â§ 6-1-920(8). Â The Act requires that the local planning commission conduct studies and make recommendations for a capital improvements plan and impact fees by service unit.[1]Â  Â§ 6-1-950.Â  After notice and a public hearing, the capital improvements plan may then be adopted by the local government.Â  Â§ 9-1-960(A).Â  A capital improvements plan is required before an impact fee ordinance can be enacted.Â  Â§ 6-1-930.Â  The revenue from impact fees must be maintained in a separate account and used only for â€œthe category of system improvements and within or for the benefit of the service area for which the impact fee was imposed as shown by the capital improvements plan.â€ Â§ 6-1-1010.\r\nTo comply with the Act, in February 2001 Town Council directed Townâ€™s planning commission to conduct studies for an impact fee.Â  Town hired Tischler &amp; Associates, Inc., a consulting firm, to prepare a feasibility analysis.Â  Tischler issued its initial proposal recommending the imposition of the fees.Â  A capital improvements plan was also drafted.Â Â  Finally, in May 2002, Tischler issued an impact fee study (the â€œTischler Reportâ€), which detailed the proposed calculation of impact fees.Â  \r\nAfter several public meetings, the capital improvements plan was adopted in December 2002.Â  The impact fee ordinance was subsequently adopted on January 8, 2003, incorporating by reference the capital improvements plan and the Tischler Report.Â  The ordinance became effective February 1, 2003.\r\nTrident commenced this action claiming the ordinance did not comply with the Act in several respects.Â  The case was referred with finality to the master-in-equity who granted Townâ€™s motion for summary judgment on several grounds, including Tridentâ€™s lack of standing, Tridentâ€™s failure to exhaust administrative remedies, lack of an appropriate remedy, and the ordinanceâ€™s compliance with the Act.Â  Trident appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1.\r\n         Does Trident have standing to maintain this action?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2.&nbsp;\r\n         Was Trident required to exhaust administrative remedies?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        3.&nbsp;\r\n         Does the capital improvements plan substantially comply with the Act?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        4.\r\n         Is the fee calculation in the ordinance proper?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Standing\r\nThe master found Trident had no standing to maintain this action.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn organization has standing on behalf of its members if one or more of its members will suffer an individual injury by virtue of the contested act.Â  Sea Pines Assâ€™n for Protection of Wildlife, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Nat. Resources, 345 S.C. 594, 550 S.E.2d 287 (2001).Â  The three required elements to establish standing are:Â  an injury in fact, a causal connection, and likelihood that a favorable decision would give relief.Â  Id.Â  The record includes an affidavit by Frank Finlaw, president of Trident, stating he has paid more than $100,000 in impact fees since the ordinance was enacted.Â  In the event the ordinance was invalidated, Town could be ordered to issue refunds which would be adequate redress.Â  We conclude Trident has standing to maintain this challenge to the ordinance.\r\n2.Â  Exhaustion of administrative remedies\r\nThe master found Trident was required to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing this action.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs required by the Act, Townâ€™s ordinance provides for administrative relief. [2]Â  The ordinance provides that a refund will be issued if:Â  (a) the fees are not expended within three years of the date they were scheduled to be spent under the capital improvements plan; or (b) a building permit was subsequently denied.Â  This relief does not extend to the right to challenge the validity of the ordinance itself.Â  A party is not required to exhaust administrative remedies if the issue is one that cannot be ruled upon by the administrative body.Â  Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 538 S.E.2d 245 (2000).Â  We find Trident was not required to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing this action.\r\n3.Â  Capital improvements plan\r\na.Â  Incorporation of Tischler Report\r\nTrident complains that the capital improvements plan does not comply with the Act.Â  The document entitled â€œCapital Improvements Planâ€ is simply a list of items with cost estimates for future years.Â  \r\nUnder the Act, a capital improvements plan is â€œa plan that identifies capital improvements for which development impact fees may be used as a funding source.â€Â  Â§ 6-1-920(3).Â  Impact fees may be charged only for system improvement costs that are capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan.Â  Â§ 6-1-920(8) and (22)(a).Â  The expenditure of revenue generated by impact fees is limited to capital improvements identified in the capital improvements plan.Â  Â§ 6-1-1010(B).Â  Finally, under Â§ 6-1-960(B), the capital improvements plan must contain:\r\n\r\n(1) a general description of all existing public facilities, and their existing deficiencies, within the service area or areas of the governmental entity, a reasonable estimate of all costs, and a plan to develop the funding resources, including existing sources of revenues, related to curing the existing deficiencies including, but not limited to, the upgrading, updating, improving, expanding, or replacing of these facilities to meet existing needs and usage;\r\n(2) an analysis of the total capacity, the level of current usage, and commitments for usage of capacity of existing public facilities, which must be prepared by a qualified professional using generally accepted principles and professional standards;\r\n(3) a description of the land use assumptions;\r\n(4) a definitive table establishing the specific service unit for each category of system improvements and an equivalency or conversion table establishing the ratio of a service unit to various types of land uses, including residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial, as appropriate;\r\n(5) a description of all system improvements and their costs necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area, based on the approved land use assumptions, to provide a level of service not to exceed the level of service currently existing in the community or service area, unless a different or higher level of service is required by law, court order, or safety consideration;\r\n(6) the total number of service units necessitated by and attributable to new development within the service area based on the land use assumptions and calculated in accordance with generally accepted engineering or planning criteria;\r\n(7) the projected demand for system improvements required by new service units projected over a reasonable period of time not to exceed twenty years;\r\n(8) identification of all sources and levels of funding available to the governmental entity for the financing of the system improvements;Â  and\r\n(9) a schedule setting forth estimated dates for commencing and completing construction of all improvements identified in the capital improvements plan.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The document entitled â€œCapital Improvements Planâ€ does not meet most of these requirements since it is simply a list of items.Â  Town asserts, however, that the capital improvements plan should be read together with the Tischler Report since both were enacted with and incorporated by reference into the ordinance.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 6-1-960(A) requires public notice and a hearing before adoption of the capital improvements plan and, under subsection (C), any change in the capital improvements plan must be approved in the same manner as the original plan.Â  The Act also provides that the capital improvements plan originate with the local planning commission.Â  The commissionâ€™s recommendations, however, â€œare not binding on the government entity, which may amend or alter the plan.â€Â  Â§ 6-1-960(A).Â  Although the Tischler Report did not originate with the planning commission, it was included in the enactment of the ordinance and was subjected to public notice and hearing.Â  Accordingly, we find the capital improvements plan was effectively amended by the Tischler Report. \r\nb.Â  Statutory compliance\r\nSection 6-1-930(A)(1) provides:\r\n\r\nOnly a governmental entity that has a comprehensive plan, as provided in Chapter 29 of this title, and which complies with the requirements of this article may impose a development impact fee. Â If a governmental entity has not adopted a comprehensive plan, but has adopted a capital improvements plan which substantially complies with the requirements of Â Section 6-1-960(B), then it may impose a development impact fee.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Town has a comprehensive plan.Â  Although Â§ 6-1-930(A)(1) seems to delineate the appropriate standard of compliance for a capital improvements plan based on whether or not the local entity has a comprehensive plan, we will not read the statute to effect an absurd result.Â  See Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994) (when construing a statute, the Court will reject meaning that would lead to an absurd result not intended by the legislature).Â  A local entity with the added safeguard of a comprehensive plan must be subject to the same, and not a more stringent, standard than a local entity without such a plan.Â  We conclude this section requires that a capital improvements plan be in substantial compliance with the requirements of Â§ 6-1-960(B), regardless of whether there is a comprehensive plan in place.Â  Accordingly, substantial compliance with the requirements for a capital improvements plan applies here.\r\nc.Â  Statutory requirements\r\nTrident complains there is no general description of Townâ€™s existing facilities as required in Â§ 6-1-960(B)(1).Â  The Tischler Report references specific facilities for each of the three categories (parks and recreation, fire, and municipal).Â  For example, a description of a facility under the Parks and Recreation category is:Â  â€œan extensive trails system including four miles of hiker/biker trail improvements.â€Â  This type of summary description is adequate as a general description.\r\nTrident contends the Tischler Report failed to include â€œan analysis of total capacity, the level of current usage, and commitments for usage of capacity of existing public facilitiesâ€ as required by Â§ 6-1-960(B)(2).Â  The Tischler Report does include evaluations of its existing facilities for each category of service and indicates fees are calculated to maintain the current level of service.Â  Because Townâ€™s existing facilities are currently functioning at an acceptable level of capacity, the fees are calculated to continue this level of service by improvement at incremental stages.Â  This evaluation substantially complies with these requirements for a capital improvements plan.\r\nTrident contends the capital improvements plan fails to identify â€œall sources and levels of funding.â€Â  The Tischler Report does note that some existing construction, such as the Public Safety Building, was purchased with the proceeds of bond issues, and calculates a credit for future bond payments.Â  Joseph Christie, the Director of Planning and Development, states in his affidavit that other funding sources were too speculative to serve as a basis for planning.Â  Although this evaluation should have been included in the Tischler Report, there is no evidence other funding was actually available but not considered.\r\nTrident complains the capital improvements plan does not include estimated dates for commencing and completing construction.Â  The document entitled â€œCapital Improvements Planâ€ states the â€œyear neededâ€ is indicated for each capital improvement on the list of items.Â  Although there are no commencement and completion dates, this information provides an estimate of when the funds will be needed.\r\nTrident complains the capital improvements plan includes items that cost less than $100,000 for equipment or have a useful life of less than five years in contravention of Â§ 6-1-920(2) and (18)(g).Â  The original document entitled â€œCapital Improvements Planâ€ includes such items, but they are not included in the Tischler Report which actually provides the figures used for the calculation of the impact fees.Â  The fact that these items were included in the original document has no significance in the calculation of fees.Â  \r\nTrident contends the capital improvements plan lacks a proportionate share analysis as required by Â§ 6-1-990.Â  This section provides that â€œan impact fee imposed upon a fee payor may not exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred by the governmental entity in providing system improvements to serve the new development.â€Â  Proportionate share is defined as the cost attributable to the new development.Â  Section 6-1-990(B) also lists specific factors to be considered including:\r\n\r\n(1) cost of existing system improvements resulting from new development within the service area or areas;\r\n(2) means by which existing system improvements have been financed;\r\n(3) extent to which the new development contributes to the cost of system improvements;\r\n(4) extent to which the new development is required to contribute to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;\r\n(5) extent to which the new development is required to provide system improvements, without charge to other properties within the service area or areas;\r\n(6) time and price differentials inherent in a fair comparison of fees paid at different times;Â  and\r\n(7) availability of other sources of funding system improvements including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies, intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation.\r\n\r\nThe Tischler Report takes into account all these factors except (6), time and price differentials.Â  The report, however, explains that all costs are given in current dollars with no assumed inflation rate, which negates the need for time and price differentials.Â  \r\nAlthough the capital improvements plan, as amended by the Tischler Report, does not comport with every criterion of the Act, we find it substantially complies with the statutory requirements.Â  \r\n4. Calculation of fees\r\nThe Act provides for the calculation of impact fees in several provisions.Â  Section 6-1-940(1) requires that the ordinance include an explanation of the calculation of the fee.Â  Section 6-1-930(B)(2) provides that the amount of the fee â€œmust be based on actual improvement costs or reasonable estimates of the costs, supported by sound engineering studies.â€Â  Section 6-1-990 limits the impact fee to a proportionate share of the cost of improvements.Â  Finally, Â§ 6-1-980 provides:\r\nÂ§ 6-1-980.Â  Calculation of impact fees.\r\n\r\n(A) The impact fee for each service unit may not exceed the amount determined by dividing the costs of the capital improvements by the total number of projected service units that potentially could use the capital improvement. If the number of new service units projected over a reasonable period of time is less than the total number of new service units shown by the approved land use assumptions at full development of the service area, the maximum impact fee for each service unit must be calculated by dividing the costs of the part of the capital improvements necessitated by and attributable to the projected new service units by the total projected new service units.\r\n(B) An impact fee must be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\r\n\r\nIn the Tischler Report, adopted by reference into Townâ€™s impact fee ordinance, fees were calculated as follows.Â  First, the report identifies three categories of impact fees:Â  parks and recreation; fire; and municipal facilities and equipment.Â  Fees for each of these categories are calculated with the â€œincremental expansion methodâ€ which uses the current level of service provided by Townâ€™s facilities and assumes expansion in regular increments.Â  This methodology essentially figures a â€œcurrent replacement costâ€ at regular intervals to pay for the increase in demand affecting each of the three categories identified above.Â  \r\nFor each category, the current replacement cost for each capital improvement is divided by Townâ€™s current number of demand units[3] to determine the â€œcost per demand unit.â€Â  The impact fee is then calculated by multiplying the cost per demand unit by the â€œdemand indicatorâ€ allocated to the type of development in question.Â  For residential development, fees are assessed per housing unit; for non-residential development, fees are assessed per 1,000 square feet or per room for motels.Â  As an example:Â  A single family detached dwelling is assumed to have 2.87 demand units.Â  The total cost per demand unit for parks and recreation is $179.27.Â  The cost per demand unit ($179.27) is multiplied by 2.87 for a fee ofÂ  $514 for a single family detached dwelling for parks and recreation.Â  This calculation is done for each category and added together for a total fee.Â  \r\nTrident contends this calculation of fees does not comply with the requirements of the Act in the following particulars.\r\na. Â Actual costs or reasonable estimates\r\nTrident claims the incremental expansion method does not use â€œactual costs or reasonable estimates supported by sound engineering studiesâ€ as required by Â§ 6-1-930(B)(2).Â  As noted above, the method used here is basically a current replacement cost approach.Â  In determining cost, the Tischler Report refers to cost information from â€œTown staffâ€ and the Marshall &amp; Swift Valuation Service. Â References to Town staff refer to the Town engineer, Matt Halter, who is a â€œpublic engineer.â€Â  Halter testified his cost estimates were â€œbased on similar projects [Town] had done in the past or similar equipment [Town] had bought in the past, historic numbers typically.â€Â  Halter stated he gave â€œengineering estimatesâ€ for items in the capital improvements plan.Â  We find the calculation of fees was based on reasonable estimates as indicated by Townâ€™s engineer.Â  \r\nb.Â  Sound engineering studies\r\nTrident complains Townâ€™s cost estimates were not based on sound engineering studies as required under Â§ 6-1-930(B)(2).[4]Â  As noted above, Townâ€™s public engineer, Matt Halter, stated he gave â€œengineering estimatesâ€ for the projected costs of capital improvements.Â  The Tischler Report also references the Marshall &amp; Swift Valuation Service, a national provider of real estate costs.[5]Â  \r\nThe Act does not specify what constitutes an â€œengineering study.â€Â  Since Town used its current facilities upon which to base estimated costs, engineering estimates are adequate.Â  Further, Trident has provided no evidence indicating cost estimates would have been different had specific engineering studies been conducted.Â  We find the use of â€œengineering estimatesâ€ and a widely accepted valuation service was adequate to meet the requirement of â€œsound engineering studies.â€\r\nc.Â  Effect of annexation\r\nTrident complains that in recommending impact fees, the forecasted population growth in Tischlerâ€™s initial feasibility study was skewed by growth through annexation.Â  This factor does not affect the calculation of impact fees.Â  The purpose of the feasibility study was simply to determine whether to consider enacting such fees.\r\nd.Â  Current level of service\r\nTrident complains Town failed to evaluate the level of service for its existing facilities.Â  â€œLevel of serviceâ€ is defined by statute as â€œa measure of the relationship between service capacity and service demand for public facilities.â€Â  Â§ 6-1-920(14).Â  Generally, it is an evaluation of how well a given service meets the publicâ€™s needs.Â  Under Â§ 6-1-930(B)(3)(b), an impact fee ordinance must â€œinclude a description of acceptable levels of service for system improvements.â€Â  \r\nThroughout the Tischler Report, the accepted level of service for projected capital improvements is the current level of service provided by Town.Â  Joseph Christie, Townâ€™s Director of Planning and Development, testified the existing level of service was deemed adequate.Â  This evaluation was based on citizen input.Â  The Tischler Report specifically states Townâ€™s intent to â€œmaintain the current level of service . . . to accommodate new residential development and not to replace or rehabilitate existing facilities/improvements.â€Â  This description of the level of service for capital improvements as the current level of service satisfies the Act.\r\nWe find the calculation of fees in the ordinance sufficient. Further, we note Trident offers no analysis of the various factors challenged that would actually result in different fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that Trident had standing to maintain this action and did not have to exhaust administrative remedies.Â  We conclude on the merits that Townâ€™s ordinance substantially complies with the statutory requirements set forth in the Act regarding the capital improvements plan and that the calculation of fees is proper.Â  The masterâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] A service unit is a standardized measure of use or discharge attributable to an individual unit of development.Â  Â§ 6-1-920(20).Â  \r\n[2]Section 6-1-1030(A) provides:Â  â€œA governmental entity which adopts a development impact fee ordinance shall provide for administrative appeals by the developer or fee payor.â€ \r\n[3]The report uses the 2002 population extrapolated from the 2000 census to determine demand units.Â  A residential demand unit is per person; non-residential is employees per 1,000 square feet.\r\n[4]This section provides:Â  â€œThe amount of the development impact fee must be based on actual improvement costs or reasonable estimates of the costs, supported by sound engineering studies.â€ \r\n[5]Marshall &amp; Swift is described on its website as follows:\r\n\r\nMarshall &amp; Swift serves a vital role in the real estate industry as the leading provider of building cost data.

(Petitioner), holding that South Carolinaâ€™s ten-year limitations period for execution[1] is not tolled for time during which a judgment debtor is out of state.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Home Port Rentals, Inc. v. Moore, 359 S.C. 230, 597 S.E.2d 810 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This Court granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 20, 1989, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina entered judgment against Respondent and in favor of Petitioner.Â  Petitioner thereafter tried to locate Respondent in order to execute on the judgment, but could not do so until January 1999.Â  \r\nOn July 14, 2000, Petitioner filed an action for declaratory judgment in the circuit court.Â  Petitioner sought a declaration that the 1989 judgment was still effective, arguing that the ten-year limitations period for execution had been tolled for the time during which Respondent was absent from South Carolina - the entire eleven-year period following entry of the judgment.Â  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the circuit court granted summary judgment to Respondent.Â  The court held that the 1989 judgment was no longer valid because it was more than ten years old.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the 1989 judgment is no longer valid because it is more than ten years old.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe judgment of the federal district court was enrolled, and therefore became a South Carolina judgment, when it was entered on March 20, 1989.Â  \r\nUnder the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act,[2] the 1989 judgment of the federal district court is a â€œforeign judgment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-910(1) (2005).Â  Ordinarily, a foreign judgment must be enrolled in this state in order to be effective as a South Carolina judgment.Â  Under federal law, however, a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina is effectively a South Carolina judgment.Â  The United States Code provides:\r\n\r\nEvery judgment rendered by a district court within a State shall be a lien on the property located in such\r\nState in the same manner, to the same extent and under\r\nthe same conditions as a judgment of a court of general\r\njurisdiction in such State, and shall cease to be a lienin the same manner and time.\r\n\r\n28 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1962 (West 1994).\r\nConsequently, South Carolina law determines the date on which the federal courtâ€™s judgment became a lien in South Carolina.\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 15-35-810 applies the federal statute and provides that a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina \r\n\r\nshall constitute a lien upon the real estate of the\r\njudgment debtor situate[d] in any county in this State in which the judgment or transcript thereof\r\nis entered upon the book of abstracts of judgments and duly indexed, the lien to begin from the time of\r\nsuch entry on the book of abstracts and indices and to continue for a period of ten years from the date of\r\nsuch final judgment ....Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-810 (2005).\r\nAs the Court of Appeals held, therefore, the district courtâ€™s judgment became effective when it was entered on March 20, 1989.\r\nAs stated above, Petitioner filed this declaratory-judgment action on July 14, 2000, more than ten years after entry of the 1989 judgment.Â  South Carolina Code section 15-39-30 provides:\r\n\r\nExecutions may issue upon final judgments or decrees at any time within ten years from the date of the original\r\n entry thereof and shall have active energy during such period, without any renewal or renewals thereof, and\r\n this whether any return may or may not have been made during such period on such executions.\r\n\r\nThis Court has consistently held that under the statute, a judgment becomes stale and a judgment lien is extinguished after ten years.Â  See, e.g., Garrison v. Owens, 258 S.C. 442, 446-47, 189 S.E.2d 31, 33 (1972); Hardee v. Lynch, 212 S.C. 6, 46 S.E.2d 179 (1948).Â  In so holding, the Court has reasoned, â€œA judgment lien is purely statutory, its duration as fixed by the legislature may not be prolonged by the courts and the bringing of an action to enforce the lien will not preserve it beyond the time fixed by statute, if such time expires before the action is tried.â€Â  Garrison, 258 S.C. at 446-47, 189 S.E.2d at 33 (citations omitted).\r\nAccording to Petitioner, the legislature has provided for the prolonging of the existence of the judgment and lien in at least one situation.Â  Relying on South Carolina Code section 15-3-30,[3] Petitioner argues the ten-year period provided by section 15-39-30 may be tolled for time that a judgment debtor spends out of the state.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 15-3-30 provides:\r\n\r\nIf when a cause of action shall accrue against any person he shall be out of the State, such action may\r\nbe commenced within the terms in this chapter respectively limited after the return of such person\r\ninto this State. And if, after such cause of action shall have accrued, such person shall depart from and reside\r\nout of this State or remain continuously absent there from for the space of one year or more, the time of his absence\r\nshall not be deemed or taken as any part of the time limited for the commencement of such action. \r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the statute does not apply here.Â  Unlike the Court of Appeals, however, we look no further than the language of section 15-3-30 to reach this conclusion.Â  The plain wording[4] of section 15-3-30 provides that the statute applies to the accrual of a â€œcause of actionâ€ and the statutory time period within which to bring the action.Â  The statute does not refer to the statutory time period within which to execute an already obtained judgment.Â  Contrary to Petitionerâ€™s argument, the right to execute on a judgment does not constitute a cause of action.Â  Indeed, execution is not initiated by bringing an action.Â  \r\nConsequently, section 15-3-30 cannot operate to toll the ten-year execution period.Â  While the limitations period for bringing an action may be tolled if the defendant is absent from the state, the period for executing an already obtained judgment may not.Â  The decision of the Court of Appeals is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

Bryant, 356 S.C. 485, 589 S.E.2d 775 (Ct. App. 2003), in which the court of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s admission of Petitionerâ€™s two prior firearms convictions.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner has been confined to a wheelchair for over twentyÂ  years due to a car accident.Â  On July 22, 1999, he was visiting the Bottoms Up strip club, where he met the victim, Daniel Fletcher Austin.Â  At approximately 3:30 a.m., the two left the club together to go back to Petitionerâ€™s hotel room.Â  \r\nBetween 3:30 and 4:00 a.m., as he was leaving his room to go to work, Kevin Hawkins saw Petitioner alone in the corridor.Â  Petitioner asked Hawkins to get him help because he said he had been injured in a physical altercation.Â  Hawkins informed the front desk clerk of Petitionerâ€™s claims.Â  As the clerk called the sheriffâ€™s department, she heard shots.Â  Immediately before calling the sheriff, the clerk testified she had given Austin a key to Petitionerâ€™s room.Â  \r\nThe police arrived and found Austin lying in the breezeway shot six times and bleeding.Â  A stand-off ensued between the police and Petitioner which lasted 20-25 minutes. The stand-off ended when a SWAT team rushed Petitionerâ€™s room and found Petitioner on the floor with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his stomach.Â  \r\nPetitioner was convicted of murder and the unlawful possession of a weapon by a convicted felon.Â  He was sentenced to life without parole for the murder and five years concurrent for the weapons charge.Â  \r\nISSUE Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in admitting Petitionerâ€™s priorÂ  firearms convictions?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ  \r\nAt trial, prior to Petitioner testifying, the State sought to introduce evidence that Petitioner had previously been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in 1984, shoplifting in 1992, a bad check charge in 1994, possession of a unlawful weapon by a convicted felon in 1997, and pointing and presenting a firearm in 1998.Â  Petitioner did not object to the admission of the shoplifting or bad check convictions.Â  He argued, however, that the manslaughter conviction should be excluded because it was more than ten years old.Â  As to the two weapons convictions, Petitioner argued they did not have anything to do with truthfulness and thus their probative value was low.Â  He further argued that their similarity to the current charges caused their admission to be highly prejudicial.Â  \r\nThe State contends the convictions were offered to impeach Petitioner and to show â€œthe defendant continues to get in trouble even after 1990.Â  Every two years, he commits at least two crimes.â€Â  The trial judge allowed the firearms convictions to be introduced, and although the manslaughter conviction itself was not introduced, Petitioner stipulated he had been convicted of a violent crime in 1984.Â  \r\nThe court of appeals affirmed Petitionerâ€™s convictions in a 2:1 decision.Â  Bryant, 356 S.C. 485, 589 S.E.2d 775.Â  Relying on State v. Green, 338 S.C. 428, 527 S.E.2d 827 (2000), the majority reviewed the trial courtâ€™s statements as a whole and concluded that the trial court had an appropriate reason to admit the evidence â€œbased on [the trial courtâ€™s] belief the testimony could lead to an inference [Petitioner] was unworthy of credibility because of his prior convictions.â€ Bryant,Â  356 S.C. at 491, 589 S.E.2d at 776.\r\nNoting the importance of â€œ[Petitioner's] testimony to his defense, and the state's burden of discounting his testimony to prove the elements of murder,â€ the Court of Appeals nonetheless held the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions to impeach his credibility.Â  Id. at 492, 589 S.E.2d at 779.Â  Judge Beatty dissented and stated he believed the prior convictions were improper character evidence and should not have been admitted.Â  Id. at 496, 589 S.E.2d at 781.Â  He also concluded that the admission was not harmless because there was not overwhelming evidence of Petitionerâ€™s guilt.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThis Court has held that a trial judge must conduct a balancing test to determine whether remote convictions are admissible under Rule 609(b), SCRE.Â  State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 626, 525 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2000).Â  Rule 609(b) creates a presumption that remote convictions are inadmissible and places the burden on the State to overcome this presumption. Id. When considering whether to admit prior convictions, a trial judge should consider the following factors: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1)\r\n         The impeachment value of the prior crime;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)\r\n         The point in time of the conviction and the witness's subsequent history;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (3)\r\n         The similarity of the past crime and the charged crime;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (4)&nbsp;\r\n         The importance of the defendant's testimony; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (5)\r\n         The centrality of the credibility issue.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 627, 525 S.E.2d at 248.Â  After the trial court conducts the balancing test, the judge must make a determination and articulate, on the record, the specific reasons for his ruling. Â Id.Â  Specifically, the trial judge must articulate why the probative value of the prior conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect.Â  State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 59-60, 609 S.E.2d 520 (2005). [1]Â  \r\nUnder Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE, if a crime is viewed as one involving dishonesty, the court must admit the prior conviction because, prior convictions involving dishonesty or false statement must be admitted regardless of their probative value or prejudicial effect.Â  Thus, Petitionerâ€™s convictions for shoplifting and writing bad checks were properly admitted and Petitioner does not dispute this.Â  The issue is whether the prior firearms convictions involve dishonesty or false statements so as to be admissible without weighing the probative value of their admission with its prejudicial effect.Â  \r\nViolations of narcotics laws are generally not probative ofÂ  truthfulness.Â  See State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 552 S.E.2d 300 S.C. (2001) (citing State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000)).Â  Furthermore, a conviction for robbery, burglary, theft, and drug possession, beyond the basic crime itself, is not probative of truthfulness.Â  United States v. Smith, 181 F.Supp.2d 904 (N.D. Ill. 2002).Â Â  Likewise, firearms violations also are not generally probative of truthfulness.Â Â  Accordingly, Petitionerâ€™s prior firearms convictions do not involve dishonesty and their probative value should have been weighed against their prejudicial effect prior to their admission pursuant to Rule 609(a)(1).\r\nIn admitting the prior firearms convictions, the trial judge noted that â€œthe fact that he may tend to get in trouble from time to time, while it has a certain amount of prejudice in it, also, does include that issue of whether or not he's worthy of belief.â€Â  The trial judge did not address the similarity of the prior convictions to the current charges as required by Colf.Â  Additionally, we note that when the prior offense is similar to the offense for which the defendant is on trial, the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant from impeachment by that prior offense weighs against its admission. See e.g., Colf, 337 S.C. at 628, 525 S.E.2d at 249.Â  Petitionerâ€™s prior firearms convictions had nothing to do with Petitionerâ€™s credibility and, their admission was more prejudicial than probative, especially in light of the offenses for which he was on trial. Accordingly, we hold the trial court erred in admitting Petitionerâ€™s prior firearms convictions. \r\nThe State, however, contends even if the trial court erred, the admission of Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions was harmless.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial. In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result. State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991). Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where a defendantâ€™s guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached. Â State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989).Â  The circumstances of each individual case are to be considered. \r\nAdditionally, â€œthis Court has placed great emphasis on the importance of a defendantâ€™s right to assert self-defense when there is any evidence to support it.â€Â  State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 235, 589 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2003) (emphasis added).Â Â  In acknowledgement of this important right, our Court has made every effort to assure that the burden remains on the State to disprove self-defense.Â  See State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298 (2002); State v. Addison, 343 S.C. 290, 540 S.E.2d 449 (2000); State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 500 S.E.2d 489 (1998). Â Â Â \r\nIn this case, Petitionerâ€™s defense was that he acted in self-defense, and this hinged entirely on his own testimony. Â Moreover, the only witnesses to the shooting were Petitioner and the victim.Â  Although, the record contains evidence which may undermine Petitionerâ€™s self-defense theory, the record also contains evidence which supports Petitionerâ€™s self-defense theory.Â  Â Therefore, the State should not be allowed to attack the defendantâ€™s credibility with inadmissible prior convictions; especially where the Petitionerâ€™s credibility was essential to his defense.Â  Accordingly, we hold the improper admission of Petitionerâ€™s prior firearms convictions was not harmless.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the improper admission of Petitionerâ€™s prior firearms convictions was erroneous and does not qualify as harmless error.Â  Accordingly, we hold his murder conviction should be\r\nREVERSED.[2]\r\nMOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice James C. Williams, concur.Â  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nBURNETT, J.:Â  I agree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion the trial court erred in admitting Petitionerâ€™s prior firearms convictions.Â  However, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s harmless error analysis.Â  Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 63, 584 S.E.2d 893, 897 (2003).Â  The materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989).Â  Error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained.Â  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992).Â  Where a review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.Â  State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 531, 466 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1996).Â  \r\nTo establish self defense: (1) the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) the defendant must have been in actual imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he must have actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) the defendant must show that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the belief that he was actually in imminent danger and that the circumstances were such as would warrant a person of ordinary prudence, firmness, and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or the loss of his life; and (4) the defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.Â  State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 344-45, 520 S.E.2d 319, 321-22 (1999); State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994). \r\nAt trial, Petitioner argued he acted in self defense and this defense hinged entirely on his own testimony.Â  In my opinion, Petitionerâ€™s exculpatory story of self defense is not plausible.Â  \r\nPetitioner testified he was living at Days Inn, where he met the victim, Austin, earlier in the week.Â  He testified on July 22, 1999, he went to Bottoms Up, a strip club, where he met Austin.Â  He and Austin had several alcoholic drinks during the evening.Â  Austin repeatedly asked Petitioner if he had any â€œweedâ€ or knew where to find any â€œweed,â€ but Petitioner repeatedly told Austin he did not.Â  Around 3:30 a.m. Petitioner left the club to go back to the hotel and Austin followed him.Â  The two men had a fist fight in the parking lot of Bottoms Up, and Petitioner testified Austin did not possess a weapon during the fight.Â  He and Austin continued towards the hotel, but they got into another fist fight during which Petitioner fell out of his wheelchair.Â  Austin kicked Petitioner in the face and eventually helped him back into his wheelchair.Â  The two men then proceeded to Petitionerâ€™s room, where they again had an altercation in front of the room.Â  Petitioner fell out of his wheelchair during this incident, and Austin helped him back into the wheelchair.Â  At this point, Austin left and went to the hotel desk clerk to get a room key.\r\nKevin Hawkins testified he saw Petitioner alone in the corridor between 3:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.Â  Petitioner asked Hawkins to tell the front desk clerk he had been robbed and needed help.Â  Hawkins testified Petitioner had a scrape on his nose and he informed the front desk of Petitionerâ€™s request.\r\nPetitioner testified as he opened the door to his room, Austin reappeared.Â  Austin then followed Petitioner inside, closed the door, and demanded â€œweed.â€Â  Petitioner testified he thought Austin would kill him and that another person was with Austin.Â  He further testified Austin was not armed.\r\nPetitioner then went to the nightstand and retrieved a loaded pistol.Â  He shot Austin six times and Austin fell, got back up, and ran out of the room.Â  Petitioner then went to the dresser and retrieved a loaded shotgun.Â  He went into the breezeway where he saw Austin leaning against the wall.[3]Â  Petitioner fired the shotgun five times because he thought Austin had not been previously hit.Â  He then went back into the room, reloaded both guns, and shot out into the hallway from the room.Â  Petitioner eventually shot himself in the stomach before being apprehended by police after a stand-off.Â  \r\nIn my opinion, Petitionerâ€™s guilt was conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion could have been reached.Â  Petitioner testified that after he shot the unarmed Austin six times, Austin ran out of the room.Â  See State v. Light, 363 S.C. 325, 610 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2005) (unarmed victim did not pose a threat to armed defendant and the defendant could not have reasonably believed she did.)Â  Further, Petitioner followed Austin out into the hallway and continued shooting, even though he was not sure it was Austin in the hallway.Â  \r\nSignificantly, the ballistics evidence does not support Petitionerâ€™s claims.Â  The Stateâ€™s ballistics experts testified the pistol shots were fired through the hotel room door.Â  Further, an officer testified he did not see any blood in the hotel room which is inconsistent with Austin having fallen after being shot several times while in the hotel room.Â  \r\nEven though the trial court erred in admitting Petitionerâ€™s prior convictions, the error was harmless because the evidence fails in any respect to support Petitionerâ€™s self-defense theory.Â  A reasonably prudent person would not have believed Petitioner had to shoot Austin repeatedly through a door, reload, follow him into the hallway, and again shoot him in the hallway in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or the loss of his life.Â Â  Accordingly, the admission of the prior firearms convictions was harmless.\r\n\r\n[1]Although Colf involved the admission of remote convictions under Rule 609(b), the â€œ[Court of Appeals] has implicitly recognized the value of these factors in making such a determination under Rule 609(a)(1), and urged the trial bench to not only articulate its ruling, but to also provide the basis for it, thereby clearly and easily informing the appellate courts that a meaningful balancing of the probative value and the prejudicial effect has taken place as required by Rule 609(a)(1).â€Â  State v. Martin, 347 S.C. 522, 530, 556 S.E.2d 706, 710 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n[2]At trial, Petitioner admitted he was guilty of unlawful possession of a weapon by a convicted felon and his self-defense argument went to only the murder charge. Accordingly, his conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon stands. \r\n[3]Petitioner testified he was not sure if the person in the breezeway was Austin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26184","title":"Delahoussaye v.

Delahoussaye, Op. No. 76-MO-106 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 12, 1976).Â  Four days later, on November 16, 1976, respondent escaped from the custody of the South Carolina Department of Corrections\r\n(SCDOC).\r\nWhile an escapee, respondent committed the federal crimes of conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to transport a stolen motor vehicle interstate, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.Â  He was sentenced to 45 years in federal district court in Georgia on February 4, 1977.Â  At the sentencing, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\nNow you all[1] have difficulties with the State of South Carolina as to the charges you were serving and have not yet completed.Â  There are other charges pending against you that have not yet been resolved.Â  The sentence that this Court imposes upon each of you today is separate and distinct of all other sentences that have been imposed or that may be imposed by any other court, Federal or State.Â  I say that so there wonâ€™t be any misunderstanding about that.\r\n\r\nThe SCDOC issued a detainer against respondent on August 7, 1979.[2]Â Â  After being paroled from federal prison, respondent returned to the SCDOCâ€™s custody on February 2, 2002.Â  The SCDOC calculated his projected max-out date for the 25-year armed robbery sentence as August 9, 2015.\r\nIn June 2002, respondent filed for PCR seeking credit for the time he served while in federal custody. Â After a hearing, the PCR court rejected the Stateâ€™s argument that, pursuant to Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000), this is an administrative matter not properly heard in PCR court.Â  In addition, the PCR court granted respondent relief and ordered that respondentâ€™s sentence â€œbe recalculated so that he is given credit for time spent in federal custody since August 7, 1979.â€Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the PCR court err in finding that respondentâ€™s claim, involving credit for time served in another jurisdiction, was appropriate for\r\n          PCR? Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2.\r\n         Did the PCR court err in finding that respondentâ€™s time served in federal custody, for crimes committed after his escape from South Carolinaâ€™s custody, entitled him to credit on his original South Carolina armed robbery sentence?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Propriety of Claim under PCR Act\r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred in allowing respondentâ€™s claim to be asserted under the PCR Act because it involves service credit which, pursuant to Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000), is the type of claim that should be reviewed under the Administrative Procedures Act\r\n(APA).\r\nIn Al-Shabazz, this Court held that under the PCR statute, PCR is proper only when the applicant mounts a collateral attack challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence. Â Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 367, 527 S.E.2d at 749 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)). Â Nonetheless, the Al-Shabazz Court noted â€œtwo non-collateral matters specifically listed in Section 17-27-20(a)(5)â€ that are cognizable under the PCR Act:Â  â€œthe claim that an applicantâ€™s sentence has expired and the claim that an applicantâ€™s probation, parole, or conditional release has been unlawfully revoked.â€[3]Â  Id. at 368, 527 S.E.2d at 749.\r\nAs for the majority of non-collateral matters, however, Al-Shabazz stated that these claims generally would be decided first by the SCDOCâ€™s internal grievance system and then would be subject to review under the APA.Â  Id. at 369, 527 S.E.2d at 750.Â  Specifically, the Court noted that â€œ[t]hese administrative matters typically arise in two ways: (1) when an inmate is disciplined and punishment is imposed and (2) when an inmate believes prison officials have erroneously calculated his sentence, sentence-related credits, or custody status.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe PCR court found that the instant case was distinguishable from Al-Shabazz, which concerned discretionary good-time credits, because this case involved â€œday-for-day time actually servedâ€ by the inmate.Â  In addition, the PCR court found that where a case involves the expiration of a sentence, Al-Shabazz specifically allowed this type of claim under the PCR Act.Â  \r\nWe agree with the PCR court that respondentâ€™s case encompasses a claim that his sentence had expired.[4] Â Therefore, this matter was appropriately filed pursuant to the PCR statute. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(5); Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 368, 527 S.E.2d at 749.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the PCR courtâ€™s ruling on this issue.\r\n2.Â  Credit For Federal Time Served After An Escape\r\nThe State also argues that when an inmate escapes from the SCDOCâ€™s custody, subsequently commits a crime in another jurisdiction while an escapee, and serves time for the subsequent crime, the inmate should not be entitled to credit for the time served simply because the SCDOC has issued a detainer.Â  The PCR court, however, found that this Courtâ€™s decision in Robinson v. State, 329 S.C. 65, 495 S.E.2d 433 (1998), clearly stated that a South Carolina convict may receive credit for the time that he is incarcerated in another jurisdiction from the time that a detainer is issued by the SCDOC.Â  We agree with the State that because Robinson did not involve an escapee, it is inapplicable to the instant case.\r\nIn Robinson v. State, Robinson had been found guilty of accessory after the fact of a felony in South Carolina state court in 1989; he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.Â  He appealed his conviction and was released on appeal bond.Â  Later in 1989, he was arrested in Chicago on federal RICO charges.Â  He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to six years in prison.Â  Then, in August 1992, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on additional, gang-related federal charges. Â The federal sentences were ordered to run concurrently with Robinsonâ€™s state sentence.Â  329 S.C. at 66-67, 495 S.E.2d at 434. Â Robinsonâ€™s state conviction was affirmed by this Court in September 1991 (which was in between his federal court convictions). Â See State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 937 (1992).\r\nRobinson filed for PCR seeking to obtain credit in South Carolina for time served in federal custody from the date his conviction was affirmed. Â Robinson had been in federal custody from the date of his 1989 arrest until January 18, 1995, when he was admitted to, but deemed absent with leave from, the SCDOC.Â  The PCR court granted Robinson credit for time served from the date his South Carolina conviction was affirmed. Â Robinson v. State, 329 S.C. at 67, 495 S.E.2d at 434.\r\nThis Court reversed explaining that because the federal sentences had been ordered to run concurrent with the South Carolina sentence, â€œthe Bureau of Prisons should have delivered Robinson into South Carolina custody so that the federal courtâ€™s imposition of a concurrent sentence could be satisfied.â€Â  Id. at 71, 495 S.E.2d at 436.Â  However, the Court also stated thatÂ Â  while a â€œconvict is subject to a South Carolina detainer, he is constructively in South Carolina custody. Â As a result, a convict will receive credit for time spent in another jurisdiction while subject to a South Carolina detainer.â€ Â Id. at 71, 495 S.E.2d at 436-37.Â  Therefore, the Court held that he should have been given credit for time served since January 18, 1995 (the date he was constructively admitted to the SCDOC). Â Id. at 71, 495 S.E.2d at 437.\r\nRespondent argues the rule of Robinson applies to his case despite the fact that he escaped from state custody.Â  Specifically, respondent maintains that the lodging of a detainer significantly harms a federal inmateâ€™s status, and these consequences occur â€œregardless of whether the person escaped.â€Â  Thus, respondent contends that the PCR court correctly applied Robinson.Â  We disagree.Â  Because Robinson was lawfully out on appeal bond, he was entitled to the credit.Â  Here, however, respondent escaped from the SCDOCâ€™s custody.Â  Under South Carolina law, it is clear respondentâ€™s status as an escapee distinguishes this case from the Robinson rule.\r\nIn Oglesby v. Leeke, 263 S.C. 283, 210 S.E.2d 232 (1974), we stated that â€œ[a]s a general rule, a sentence can be satisfied only by death, service of the required time, or relief therefrom by competent authority.â€Â  Id. at 287, 210 S.E.2d at 234.Â  There, Oglesby had been sentenced to three years for housebreaking and larceny; he escaped approximately five months after his sentence began.Â  Subsequently, he committed a crime in New York and served time there.Â  While serving the New York sentence, a detainer was filed requesting a hold for South Carolina.Â  Oglesby refused to waive extradition, but extradition was eventually granted, and he returned to prison in South Carolina to complete service of the three-year sentence.Â  Id. at 285-86, 210 S.E.2d at 233.\r\nThis Court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s denial of â€œcredit for any of the time he was away during his escape.â€Â  Id. at 286, 210 S.E.2d at 233.Â  Significantly, we held that Oglesbyâ€™s escape â€œtolled the running of the sentence he was then serving and the time of his imprisonment under that sentence did not again begin to run until his return to the South Carolina prison.â€Â  Id.Â  Moreover, we observed that Oglesbyâ€™s:\r\n\r\n[E]ntire absence was because of his escape and his resistance to efforts of the State of South Carolina to effect his return for the service of his sentence. Â It is undisputed that no part of his absence or imprisonment in New York was in execution of the South Carolina sentence.\r\n\r\nId. at 286-87, 210 S.E.2d at 233-34 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWe hold that the rule of Oglesby was not modified by this Courtâ€™s decision in Robinson and therefore directly applies to respondentâ€™s case.Â  Here, as in Oglesby, respondentâ€™s entire absence from the SCDOCâ€™s custody was because of his escape.Â  Furthermore, given the federal trial judgeâ€™s comments regarding respondentâ€™s â€œdifficulties with the State of South Carolinaâ€ and that the federal sentence was â€œseparate and distinct of all other sentences that have been imposed or that may be imposed by any other court,â€ respondent cannot assert that his federal sentence was intended to run concurrently with his South Carolina sentence.\r\nMoreover, because we have previously distinguished a rule regarding service credit based on whether the inmateâ€™s status was non-escapee versus escapee, it is consistent with South Carolina case law that the Robinson rule should not be applied to an escapee. Â Compare State v. Dozier, 263 S.C. 267, 210 S.E.2d 225 (1974) (holding that where a non-escapee is imprisoned in another state while contesting extradition, he is entitled to credit on any subsequent South Carolina sentence) with Kephart v. State, 277 S.C. 395, 289 S.E.2d 402 (1982) (holding that escapeeâ€™s time spent imprisoned in Pennsylvania contesting extradition should not be credited toward his remaining armed robbery sentence in South Carolina).[5]\r\nFinally, we note that several other states have also ruled an escapee cannot be credited with time served in another jurisdiction on a subsequent crime.Â  See, e.g., Woodson v. State, 383 N.E.2d 1096 (Ind. Ct. App. 1978); Williams v. State, 280 N.W.2d 406 (Iowa 1979); State ex rel. Linehan v. Wood, 397 N.W.2d 341 (Minn. 1986); Commonwealth ex rel. Goins v. Rundle, 192 A.2d 720 (Pa.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 959 (1963); Carter v. State, 523 S.W.2d 639 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1975).Â  \r\nIndeed, â€œ[i]t would be a novel rule which would allow a sentenced criminal, by the simple expedient of escape, to select the state in which he wishes to serve his incarceration.â€Â  Williams, 280 N.W.2d at 408; see also Carter, 523 S.W.2d at 640 (â€œService of jail time in another jurisdiction during a fugitive status certainly does not double as service of the punishment escaped from.â€).\r\nIn sum, we find the PCR court erred by applying Robinson and ordering that respondentâ€™s sentence be recalculated by the SCDOC.Â  Because respondentâ€™s escape â€œtolled the running of the sentence he was then serving,â€ the SCDOC correctly calculated that his 25-year armed robbery sentence originally imposed in 1976 â€œdid not again begin to run until his return to the South Carolina prisonâ€ in 2002.Â  Oglesby, 263 S.C. at 287, 210 S.E.2d at 234. \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s grant of relief to respondent.Â  See Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000) (the Court will reverse if the PCR courtâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of law).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above reasons, the PCR courtâ€™s finding that respondent properly pursued this action under the PCR Act is affirmed.Â  However, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s ruling that respondent was entitled to credit on his South Carolina armed robbery sentence for federal time served after he escaped from the SCDOCâ€™s custody.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Respondent had a co-defendant in federal court.Â  \r\n[2] The August 7, 1979, letter indicated respondent was â€œwanted to complete the remainder of the 25-year sentence from which he escaped on November 16, 1976,â€ in addition to being wanted for other outstanding charges related to his escape. Â Eventually, the detainer that was specifically related to the unresolved charges was considered â€œvoidâ€ for lack of prosecution, but a â€œholdâ€ was continued due to respondentâ€™s 25-year sentence for the armed robbery conviction.\r\n[3]Â  Section 17-27-20 lists who may institute a PCR action and specifically states that â€œ[a]ny person who has been convicted of, or sentenced for, a crime and who claims: Â â€¦ (5) That his sentence has expired, his probation, parole or conditional release unlawfully revoked, or he is otherwise unlawfully held in custody or other restraintâ€ may bring a claim under the PCR Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(5) (2003) (emphasis added).\r\n[4] We note the SCDOC released respondent from its custody after the PCR court granted him relief (but prior to the State filing its appeal).Â  Thus, under these particular facts, it is clear to us respondentâ€™s claim regarding credit for approximately 23 years of federal time actually served indeed was a claim that his 25-year South Carolina sentence had expired.\r\n[5] The Legislature has also made distinctions regarding service credit based on an inmateâ€™s escapee status. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-40 (1976) (statute for computation of time served by prisoners provides that full credit shall be given for time served prior to trial and sentencing, except that credit for time served shall not be given â€œwhen the prisoner at the time he was imprisoned prior to trial was an escapee from another penal institutionâ€).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26185","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, and Assistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Isaac McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: Â This is a capital case.Â  Roberts was convicted of the murder of two Beaufort County Sheriffâ€™s Deputies and was sentenced to death.Â  The sole issue he raises on appeal is whether the trial court erred in requiring him to remain present during the sentencing phase of his trial.Â  We affirm the convictions and sentence.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn January 2002, Roberts lived in a trailer owned by Brenda Smith on Riley Road in Beaufort County.Â  Also residing at the trailer were Smithâ€™s husband, Isaac, and Robertsâ€™ wife Nzuri.Â  At the time of the crime in this case, a girl named Kimberly Blake, with whom Roberts had an infant daughter, was also staying there.Â  On January 8, 2002, Kimberly Blake asked her friend, Strawberry Washington, to call police to come to the house to assist her in leaving because Roberts had hit her.Â  Beaufort County Sheriffâ€™s Deputies Dyke Coursen and Dana Tate responded.Â  According to Kimberly Blake, when police arrived, Roberts hid in the bedroom closet with his rifle.Â  He gave Kimberly the okay to go out of the bedroom.Â  She left the bedroom and Brenda Smith gave the officers permission to search the bedroom.Â  Officers Coursen and Tate went into the bedroom.Â  Smith and Blake heard gunshots.Â  Blake ran outside and down the road.Â  She was joined shortly after by Roberts coming through the woods with a gun in his hands.Â  Roberts stated, â€œI just killed those two white bitches and Iâ€™m going to say it was self-defense.â€Â  Blake left Roberts and returned to the scene to talk to police.\r\nWhen backup officers responded to the scene, they found officers Coursen and Tate dead; Coursen had suffered six gunshot wounds, Tate had seven.Â  Roberts was subsequently found hiding in the mud under a bridge with a shoulder and hip wound.Â  Roberts was arrested.Â  At the time, he had a black fanny pack carrying ammunition for an M-14 assault rifle, a cell phone and a knife.Â  Police subsequently found a rifle magazine and an SKS assault rifle in the area in which Roberts had fled.Â  The bullets and casings recovered from the victims and the scene of the crime were conclusively matched to the assault rifle.Â Â Â  \r\nRoberts was charged with capital murder.Â  At the guilt or innocence phase of trial, he chose to represent himself.Â  However, two attorneys remained as stand-by counsel to assist him at trial.Â  While the jury was deliberating, Roberts indicated to the trial court that if the jury returned a guilty verdict, he did not intend to participate at sentencing.Â  He also indicated he did not want his stand-by attorneys to present a defense.Â  Roberts indicated that if the trial court required him to be present at the sentencing hearing, he would be unruly and would have to be restrained.Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Roberts of two counts of murder.Â  Roberts advised the court he did not intend to offer any mitigating evidence and expressed his desire to absent himself from the sentencing; he indicated he would probably be unruly if required to be present.Â  Stand-by counsel conferred with Roberts and then advised the court as follows:\r\n\r\nHe says that he doesnâ€™t agree to any changes in his status as attorney of record, and that if the court makes any change, theyâ€™ll have to do it on their own motion. . . and that if the judge - if the attorneys on stand-by are to perform in any capacity, the judge will have to order that on his own motion. . . Â He says that he doesnâ€™t want to be present in this courtroom in order to hear the evidence in the second phase.Â  And that if the judge - but he does not intend to disrupt the proceedings. . . but if the judge determines that he should be in one of the side rooms . . . thatâ€™s a decision that his honor will have to make himself.Â  He says that he is withdrawing from any further discussion with the court. . . . he does not intend to cooperate with stand-by counsel, to bring any witnesses. . . .\r\n\r\nThe trial court was concerned with Robertsâ€™ decision, but was also disturbed that to appoint counsel to represent Roberts at sentencing might compromise his right to proceed pro se.Â  Roberts continued to maintain that he did not intend to confront any witnesses, and did not want to see the witnesses.Â  He persisted in advising the court that if forced to remain present, he would be disruptive.Â  As neither party could point to specific case law governing the circumstances, the court determined the best course of action was to proceed with Roberts present in the courtroom, with the condition that if he became disruptive, the trial judge would take such action as necessary.Â  Roberts indicated his desire that counsel not represent him in any way, but ultimately decided counsel could remain as stand-by counsel to object to the introduction of improper evidence.Â  \r\nThe sentencing proceeded with Roberts seated at counsel table.Â  As soon as the first witness was sworn, Roberts stood and began to chant aloud, â€œBlessed be Yahweh, El Shaddai, Jehova, God Almighty, the God of Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, and Jesus.â€Â  He was told by the court to be seated, and when he continued chanting, he was removed and a brief hearing was held in the hearing room at the back of the courtroom.Â  Roberts was brought back into the courtroom and once again began chanting when the witness began to testify.Â  The jury was removed, and Roberts was placed in a conference room at the back of the courtroom which had a glass partition to allow him to hear and see into the courtroom.Â  He was initially restrained, but the restraints were removed before the jury was returned to the courtroom.Â  \r\nThroughout sentencing, the court offered to allow Roberts to come back into the courtroom if he could do so without being disruptive; however, Roberts indicated he would rather remain in the back room.Â  Roberts ultimately returned to the courtroom to make a closing statement to the jury.Â  After deliberations, the jury found the existence of the two aggravating circumstances and recommended a sentence of death.Â Â  Roberts appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court commit reversible error in refusing Robertsâ€™ request to be completely absent from sentencing?Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIt is well-established that an accused may waive the right to counsel and proceed pro se.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998), citing Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).Â  Although a defendantâ€™s decision to proceed pro se may be to his own detriment, it â€œmust be honored out of that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nCiting State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 360 S.E.2d 706, 711 (1987), Roberts asserts a defendant need not be present at all times during a capital trial.Â  We find Bell inapplicable to the facts of this case.Â  There, the defendant twice disrupted the guilt-phase closing argument of his defense counsel, objecting to the trial proceeding on the Sabbath.Â  After being warned against such conduct, Bell again disrupted the proceedings, and was removed to a holding cell without the benefit of any audio hookup.Â  This Court held that the right to be present at trial could be waived, and that Bellâ€™s disruptive conduct amounted to a waiver of the right to be present at trial, such that he could not be heard to complain.Â  \r\nAlthough it may, under certain circumstances, be permissible to allow a capital defendant to be absent from trial, this does not mean there is a constitutional right to be absent.Â  On the contrary, this Court has specifically held there is no constitutional right of a defendant not to be present at trial.Â  State v. Moore, 308 S.C. 349. 417 S.E.2d 869 (1992).[1] Â Â Accordingly, no constitutional right of Roberts was violated by his continued presence at trial.[2]Â  Â Â Â \r\nMoreover, Roberts has demonstrated no prejudice from his continued attendance at trial; there is simply no basis to conclude that his death sentence resulted from his presence in a holding cell at the back of the courtroom.Â  Accord State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1077, 119 S.Ct. 816, 142 L.Ed.2d 675 (1999) (death penalty defendant failed to show prejudice from presence in jury room of religious pamphlet concerning Godâ€™s view of death penalty, where misconduct did not affect juryâ€™s verdict).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRobertsâ€™ convictions and sentence are affirmed.Â  We have conducted the mandatory review required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â  16-3-25 (1985).Â  The evidence indicates the sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, the evidence supports the finding of the aggravating circumstances, and the sentence is not disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases.Â  State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283, 621 S.E.2d 883 (2005), cert. denied, ___ U.S.___ 2006 WL 565552 (May 15, 2006); State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1025 (2000); State v.

South, 285 S.C. 529, 331 S.E.2d 775, cert. denied 474 U.S. 888 (1985). \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The defendant in Moore asserted he had a right not to be present at trial in order to preclude an in-court identification of him by the Stateâ€™s witnesses.Â  However, our holding in Moore unequivocally held there is no constitutional right not to be present at trial.Â  Moore applies not only where the defendant wishes to prevent an identification, but applies with equal force in any case in which the defendant desires to absent himself from trial. \r\n[2] Â Moreover, Rule 16, SCRCrimP, states that, â€œexcept in cases wherein capital punishment is a permissible sentence, a person indicted for misdemeanors and/or felonies may voluntarily waive his right to be present and may be tried in his absence. . . â€Â  In a similar situation, the California Supreme Court recently held a â€œcapital defendant may not voluntarily waive his right to be present during . . . those portions of the trial in which evidence is taken, and . . . may not be removed from the courtroom unless he has been disruptive or threatens to be disruptive.â€Â  People v. Huggins, 41 Cal. Rptr. 3d 593 (2006).Â  Similarly, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals has recognized that until 1997 (when Alabama Rules Crim. Proc., Rule 9.1(a), (b)(2) was amended), a defendant charged with a capital offense could not waive his right to be present at any phase of the capital trial.Â  Robitaille v.

Mathison, Jr., of Mathison &amp; Mathison, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\nJames B. Richardson, Jr., of Law Office of James B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES: Â This is a default-judgment case.Â  Appellant appeals from an order of the master-in-equity that Appellant was in default, and from an order of default judgment.Â  We certified the case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and we now affirm the entry-of-default order, and affirm in part and reverse in part the default-judgment order.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant is a North Carolina corporation that owned two parcels of property in the Harbor Island subdivision in Beaufort County, South Carolina.Â  On February 6, 2004, Respondent filed a notice and certificate of lien on the two parcels.[1]Â  Respondent served the notice and certificate by mail on Robert Honeycutt (Honeycutt), Appellantâ€™s principal and manager, at Honeycuttâ€™s North Carolina address.Â  \r\nOn March 4, 2004, Respondent filed a summons and complaint seeking foreclosure on the two parcels.[2]Â  According to the complaint, Appellant had failed to pay membership fees owed on the two lots for assessment years 1991-1992 through 2003-2004.Â  The fees were owed pursuant to the Harbor Island Ownersâ€™ Association Covenants.\r\nOn March 19, 2004, a process server personally served the summons and complaint on Paul Barber (Barber), the person listed with the Secretary of State as Appellantâ€™s registered agent for service of process.Â  Barber swore in his affidavit that he â€œthrew the papers awayâ€ because he thought he had â€œno business affiliationâ€ with Appellant.Â  He swore that he had â€œhad no knowledge of why or how [he] became named as the agent for service forâ€ Appellant.\r\nOn April 22, 2004, Respondent filed an affidavit of default with the clerk of court for Beaufort County.Â  Respondent served the affidavit by mail on both Barber and Honeycutt.\r\nAppellantâ€™s attorney became aware of the complaint and the affidavit of default on April 27.Â  On April 28, Appellant filed an answer to the complaint.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn July 22, 2004, Appellant filed a document entitled Motion to Determine that Default Has Not Been Entered and in the Alternative to Set Aside Entry of Default.Â  After a hearing, the master denied the motion.Â  The master found that Appellant was in default and that Appellant had failed to show good cause to set aside the entry of default.Â  \r\nThe master also granted Respondentâ€™s motion for default judgment in the amount of the unpaid membership dues.Â  The master found that Respondent was entitled to pre- and post-judgment interest on each late fee at a rate of eighteen percent per annum, which the master found was a contractual rate established by the association covenants.Â  The master then held that Respondent was entitled to recover its damages through foreclosure on the two parcels, and the master declared that he would hold a public auction.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the master erred in finding that Appellant was in default.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the master erred in finding that a contractual interest rate of eighteen percent applied.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWe affirm the entry-of-default order and affirm in part and reverse in part the default-judgment order.Â  The master did not abuse his discretion in finding Appellant in default, but the master did abuse his discretion in holding that a contractual interest rate of eighteen percent applied to the judgment.\r\nI.Â  Entry of Default\r\nâ€œThe decision whether to set aside an entry of default or a default judgment lies solely within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  The\r\ntrial court's decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion ... occurs when ... the order was controlled by some error of law or when the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Roberson v. S. Finance of S.C., Inc., 365 S.C. 6, 9, 615 S.E.2d 112, 114 (2005) (citations and internal quotation omitted).\r\nAppellant argues that Respondentâ€™s affidavit of default was a nullity because it was filed before the time for Appellant to answer had expired.Â  Respondent filed the affidavit of default thirty-four days after serving the complaint on Barber, Appellantâ€™s registered agent.Â  Appellant notes the rule that generally, â€œ[a] defendant shall serve his answer within 30 days after the service of the complaint upon him.â€ Â Rule 12(a), SCRCP.Â  According to Appellant, however, under Rule 6(e), SCRCP, a defendant has thirty-five days to answer if service is made upon a registered agent.\r\nRule 6(e) provides:\r\n\r\nWhenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  period after the service of a notice or other paper upon\r\nhim and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail or upon a person designated by statute to accept service,\r\nfive days shall be added to the prescribed period. \r\n\r\nRule 6(e), SCRCP (emphasis added).\r\nIn Appellantâ€™s view, a â€œregistered agentâ€ is â€œa person designated by statute to accept service,â€ because a registered agent is a creature of statute.Â  Appellant also points to the South Carolina Reportersâ€™ Comments on various statutes, which seem to view registered agents as statutory agents.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 33-5-101 rptr. cmt. (referring to the registered agent for a domestic corporation as a â€œstatutory agentâ€), 33-5-104 (same, and implicitly differentiating between the Secretary of Stateâ€™s status as a statutory agent and a registered agentâ€™s status as a statutory agent), and 33-15-107 (discussing the â€œappointment of a statutory agentâ€ by a foreign corporation).Â  Because Barber was a statutory agent, Appellant claims, Appellant had thirty-five days within which to file its answer.Â  Because Respondent filed its affidavit of default prior to the expiration of Appellantâ€™s time to file an answer, the affidavit of default was a nullity, and default was never properly entered.\r\nWe agree with Respondent that a â€œregistered agentâ€ is not a â€œperson designated by statute to accept serviceâ€ and that Rule 6(e) therefore does not apply.Â  While section 33-15-107 requires a foreign corporation to designate an agent, the statute itself makes no designation.Â  Cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-245 (2005) (providing that service of process is made upon the Secretary of State for businesses that do business in the state without authorization); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-270 (2005) (providing for service of process upon the Director of the Department of Insurance for insurance companies).\r\nConsequently, we affirm the masterâ€™s holding that default was properly entered against Appellant.\r\nII. Â Interest Rate\r\nConcerning the judgment of default, Appellant argues that the master erred in finding that a contractual interest rate of eighteen percent applied to pre- and post-judgment interest on the unpaid membership fees.Â  We agree.\r\nThe masterâ€™s findings of fact must be upheld â€œunless wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Roberson, 365 S.C. at 11, 615 S.E.2d at 115.Â  Here, the masterâ€™s finding is not supported by the evidence in the record.\r\nAt the damages hearing, Respondent introduced a copy of the neighborhood covenants.Â  Article V, section 6 of the covenants provides that unpaid dues carry â€œinterest thereon at a rate set by the Board of Directors.â€Â  To show the rate set by the board, Respondent called its bookkeeper to testify.Â  Respondentâ€™s attorney asked, â€œAnd what is the interest rate that accrues on those assessments?â€Â  The bookkeeper answered, â€œ18% -- I think, 19%.Â  Itâ€™s in the computer, but I donâ€™t remember it.â€\r\nThe master found that the bookkeeperâ€™s testimony supported Respondentâ€™s claim for an eighteen-percent contractual interest rate.Â  We agree with Appellant that the testimony did not constitute evidence supporting the masterâ€™s finding.Â  The bookkeeper did not remember the rate.Â  \r\nRespondent asserts that regardless of the evidence submitted at the hearing, the basis for the masterâ€™s finding, the record reveals an additional sustaining ground.Â  Respondent argues it is entitled to the eighteen-percent rate because the rateâ€™s application was alleged in the complaint.[3]Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe interest on the unpaid assessments is part of damages.Â  By defaulting, Appellant admitted the allegations in the complaint concerning liability, not damages.Â  Respondent had the burden of proving damages.Â  See Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., 275 S.C. 562, 566, 274 S.E.2d 290, 292 (1981) (discussing Howard v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 271 S.C. 238, 246 S.E.2d 880 (1978)).Â  \r\nRegarding proof of damages, Rule 55(b)(1), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\r\nWhen the claim of a party seeking judgment by default is for a liquidated amount, a sum certain or\r\na sum which can by computation be made certain, the judge, upon motion or application of the party\r\nseeking default, and upon affidavit of the amount due, shall enter judgment for that amount and costs\r\nagainst the party against whom judgment by default is sought, if that party has been defaulted for failure\r\nto appear and if such party is not a minor or incompetent person.Â  A verified pleading may be\r\nused in lieu of an affidavit when the pleading contains information sufficient to determine or\r\ncompute the sum certain. \r\n\r\nHere, Respondent attached verified statements of accounts to the complaint. Â See Rule 9(i), SCRCP (providing that â€œ[i]n an action on an account the pleader shall attach a verified copy of the account to the pleading, or if the items of the account are set forth in the pleading, it must be verifiedâ€).Â  These accounts do not reference accrued or accruing interest, let alone a particular interest rate.Â  The account statements, therefore, do not satisfy Rule 55 with respect to the claim for a contractual rate.Â  Further, the complaint itself is not verified; thus, the allegation in the complaint does not satisfy Rule 55, either.Â  \r\nWe therefore reverse the masterâ€™s holding that Appellant owes interest on the judgment at a rate of eighteen percent, and we remand the case to the master with instruction to order payment at the judgment rate.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the order denying Appellantâ€™s motion to set aside entry of default.Â  We reverse the finding in the default-judgment order that a contractual interest rate of eighteen percent applied, and remand the case to the master with instruction to apply the judgment rate.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent later filed a lis pendens.\r\n[2] Respondent also pleaded a cause of action for damages, which is not at issue on appeal. Â \r\n[3] In its complaint, Respondent alleged it was entitled to interest â€œat a rate set by the Board (1 1/2% per month).â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26188 ","title":"BB&amp;T v.

Taylor, Op. No. 2004-UP-513 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Oct. 14, 2004).Â  Carolyn M. Taylor a/k/a Carolyn Yvonne Murphy Taylor (Petitioner) contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the lower courtâ€™s denial of a motion to set aside a judgment against her and in favor of BB&amp;T f/k/a Southern National Bank (Respondent).Â  We find Petitioner was not properly served with process and reverse.Â  \r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn May 29, 1998, Respondent filed an action against Petitioner for collection of a consumer debt.Â  Respondent hired a private process server, Robert Jones, who verified Petitionerâ€™s residential address.Â  Jones also obtained the make and model of Petitionerâ€™s vehicle and license tag number through public records.Â  \r\nJones made nine visits to Petitionerâ€™s residence attempting to serve her, and he left a message on the residenceâ€™s answering machine.Â  On June 17, 1998, Jones arrived at Petitionerâ€™s residence about 4:30 p.m. and departed about 17 minutes later.Â  There were two vehicles in the driveway including the one registered to Petitioner.Â  Jones claimed someone was inside the residence but would not open the door or communicate with him.Â  He called out his intent to leave the papers and then posted the summons and complaint on the front door of the residence.Â  \r\nRespondent filed an affidavit of default, and on August 3, 1998, a judgment in default was entered against Petitioner.Â  On July 16, 2002, Petitioner filed a motion to set aside the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â  Petitioner alleged the default judgment should be set aside because the court lacked personal jurisdiction due to insufficient service of process. The lower court found Petitioner had been sufficiently served with process and denied Petitionerâ€™s motion.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed. Â BB&amp;T v. Taylor, Op. No. 2004-UP-513 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Oct. 14, 2004).Â Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the lower courtâ€™s denial\r\nof Petitionerâ€™s motion to set aside a judgment against her?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the judge.Â  Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 494, 413 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1992).Â  Our standard of review, therefore, is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion arises where the judge issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or where the order is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.Â  Tri-County Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner alleges she did not personally receive the summons and complaint in this case as required by Rule 4, SCRCP.Â  She contends the Court of Appeals therefore erred in affirming the lower courtâ€™s denial of her motion to set aside a judgment against her.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, provides:Â  â€œOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding [because] . . . the judgment is void.â€Â  A judgment is void if a court acts without personal jurisdiction. Â Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham &amp; Co., 318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995).Â  A court generally obtains personal jurisdiction by the service of a summons.Â  Ex parte S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 350 S.C. 404, 407, 566 S.E.2d 196, 198 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing State v. Sanders, 118 S.C. 498, 502, 110 S.E. 808, 810 (1920) (â€œThe purpose of the summons is to acquire jurisdiction of the person of the defendant. . . .â€)).\r\nUnder Rule 4(d)(1), SCRCP, service shall be made as follows:\r\n\r\nUpon an individual other than a minor under the age of 14 years\r\nor an incompetent person, by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to him personally or by leaving copies thereof at\r\nhis dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or by delivering\r\na copy to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. \r\n\r\nâ€œRule 4, SCRCP, serves at least two purposes.Â  It confers personal jurisdiction on the court and assures the defendant of reasonable notice of the action.â€Â  Roche v. Young Bros., Inc. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 209, 456 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995).Â  \r\nThe movant in a Rule 60(b) motion has the burden of presenting evidence proving the facts essential to entitle her to relief.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Exacting compliance with the rules is not required to effect service of process.Â  Roche, 318 S.C. at 209-10, 456 S.E.2d at 899.Â  â€œRather, [the Court must] inquire whether the plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the rules such that the court has personal jurisdiction of the defendant and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.â€Â  Id. at 210, 456 S.E.2d at 899.Â  A presumption of proper service exists when the rules governing service are followed.Â  Roche, 318 S.C. at 211, 456 S.E.2d at 900 (citation omitted). \r\nThe dispositive issue in this case is what constitutes delivery of a copy of\r\nthe summons and complaint to the individual personally where the process server has repeatedly attempted to serve process and during the attempt at issue believed an individual was inside the residence but never saw or communicated with the individual.[1]Â  Petitionerâ€™s residence and the manner of service of process are undisputed.Â  In an affidavit of service, Jones stated he posted the documents on the front door â€œafter person(s) inside refused to answer door.â€Â  In a subsequent affidavit, Jones stated he posted the documents on the front door after determining a person was present inside the residence, knocking and calling out to the alleged occupant, determining the alleged occupant would not communicate with him, confirming one of the vehicles at the residence belonged to Petitioner, and calling out his intent to leave the papers.Â  \r\nAlthough there is no South Carolina case directly on point, we find Patel v. Southern Brokers, Ltd., 277 S.C. 490, 289 S.E.2d 642 (1982), instructive.Â  In Patel, the plaintiff attempted service of process under the long arm statute because the defendant was a North Carolina corporation.Â  The summons and complaint were sent to the defendant by certified mail, return receipt requested.Â  The plaintiff could not enter proof of service because the postal service returned the unopened envelope as refused.Â  Noting â€œtechnical objections to service of processâ€ had been overruled â€œwhere the defendant had not been denied due process,â€ the Court found a defendant could not avoid process by refusing to accept registered mail known to contain a summons and complaint.Â  Id. at 494, 289 S.E.2d at 645. Â Once the documents were made available to the defendant, â€œthe mailman was not required to ram them down the Defendantâ€™s throat.â€Â  Id. at 495, 289 S.E.2d at 645.Â  The Court concluded the defendant had been served with process and the lower court had jurisdiction over the defendant. \r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in this case cited foreign authority which dealt with situations in which the process server left the summons and complaint on the door or doorstep of the defendantâ€™s residence after the process server talked to or had contact with an individual inside the residence who refused service.Â  See Taylor, Op. No. 2004-UP-513 (citing Jacobson v. Garland, 487 S.E.2d 640 (Ga. Ct. App. 1997) (sufficient service of process found where process server told defendantâ€™s wife in a face-to-face encounter that he was serving process on her, defendantâ€™s wife closed the door without accepting the documents, and thereafter, process server left documents at the foot of the door and loudly announced he was leaving the documents); Bossuk v. Steinberg, 447 N.E.2d 56 (N.Y. 1983) (sufficient delivery found where the process server announced intention to leave the summons and complaint and left a copy of the documents outside the defendantâ€™s door after a person of suitable age and discretion refused to open the door to accept service); Wood v. Weenig, 736 P.2d 1053 (Utah Ct. App. 1987) (defendant was properly served when process server left summons and complaint on defendantâ€™s doorstep after an individual claiming to be defendantâ€™s daughter and over 14 years old refused to accept documents); CRB v. State, Depâ€™t of Family Servs., 974 P.2d 931 (Wyo. 1999) (sufficient service of process found where after defendant refused to open the door, process server left the summons and complaint in defendantâ€™s mailbox and informed defendant he was being served)).Â  \r\nUnlike the foreign authority cited by the Court of Appeals, Jones merely speculated that an individual of suitable age and discretion was inside Petitionerâ€™s residence and was refusing to communicate with him during his attempts to serve process.Â  Also, Petitioner did not refuse to accept a copy of the summons and complaint, unlike the defendant in Patel.Â  Rather, there are no facts in the record to indicate Petitioner was even aware of the process server and his attempts to serve her.Â  Petitioner was not properly served under these facts because Jones never saw or spoke to anyone who resided in Petitionerâ€™s residence nor did anyone refuse acceptance before Jones attached the summons and complaint to Petitionerâ€™s front door.Â  See generally Willoughby v. Seese Realty Inc., 421 So.2d 691 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982) (statutory requirements for personal service were not met where the sheriff did not deliver the summons and complaint to the defendant but left a copy of the documents at the defendantâ€™s door); Thomas v. Johnson, 423 S.E.2d 306 (Ga. Ct. App. 1992) (statutory requirements for personal service were not met where process server tacked the summons and complaint to the defendantâ€™s front door and process server never saw or talked to the defendant nor were there any facts to indicate the defendant was aware of the process server).Â  \r\nThe process server is not required to ram the documents down a defendantâ€™s throat and personal service of process â€œshould not become a game of wiles and tricks.â€ 62B Am.Jur.2d Process Â§ 190 (2005).Â  However, there must be something more than a mere suspicion of a defendantâ€™s refusal to accept the summons and complaint before we are willing to find a defendant was sufficiently served with process by a means other than strict compliance with Rule 4(d)(1), SCRCP.[2] Â Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the lower court abused its discretion in denying Petitionerâ€™s motion to set aside the judgment, and we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Respondent contends we should apply the following factors to determine whether Petitionerâ€™s motion to set aside the judgment was properly granted: the promptness\r\nwith which relief is sought, the reasons for the failure to act promptly, the existence of a meritorious defense, and the prejudice to the other parties are relevant.Â  These factors do not apply to a motion made pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â  See New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Bey Corp., 312 S.C. 47, 50, 435 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 1993) (listing the factors); see, e.g., Hill v. Dotts, 345 S.C. 304, 547 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 2001) (applying the factors to a motion made under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP); Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 548 S.E.2d 223 (Ct. App. 2001) (same).\r\n[2]Â  We find it unnecessary to address Petitionerâ€™s argument regarding Rule 4(g), SCRCP. See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist.

Carpenter and Jennifer J. Miller, both of Carpenter Law Firm, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE HILL:Â  In 1976, Oconee County electors approved a referendum authorizing the County to own and operate a wastewater treatment facility, but limiting funding for this service to three sources and limiting service to â€œportions of Oconee County.â€Â  Oconee County appeals a circuit court order holding that these restrictions apply to any expansion of Countyâ€™s sewer system, and awarding respondent Cornelius attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (2005).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe 1976 referendum (Referendum) authorized Oconee County â€œto acquire, purchase, construct and operate a wastewater treatment facility to serve portions of Oconee County, consisting of a treatment plant, trunk lines, connector lines and other necessary and appropriate apparatus.Â  Provided and upon condition that the sole funds utilized for the acquisition, purchase, construction, maintenance and operation of such facilities shall be obtained and derived from: (1) Grants from Federal and State agencies; (2) Revenue earned and derived from the operation of the facilities to be constructed and paid only by the users thereof; and (3) Bonds payable from revenues produced and earned from the operation of such facilities.â€ (emphasis added). Â Pursuant to the Referendum, County built and operates a sewer system serving parts of the County.\r\nIn December 2004, respondent Cornelius, a County citizen and taxpayer, brought this declaratory judgment action against County.Â  Cornelius asserted County had adopted and intended to implement a Master Plan that, among other things, anticipated construction of new wastewater treatment facilities.Â  She alleged that County had approved a contract with SCDOT to construct a treatment facility to serve an interstate highway â€œWelcome Center,â€ and that the contract included a cap on sewage treatment charges. Â Cornelius claimed County intended to fund these projects and to offset any losses using ad valorem tax dollars, and contended that this funding scheme violated the conditions set by the 1976 Referendum.[1]Â  County acknowledged its plans to fund sewer expansion using tax monies.\r\nThe circuit court granted Cornelius summary judgment, holding that County may fund sewer projects only within its boundaries, and only using the three types of funding listed in the Referendum.Â  The circuit court subsequently awarded Cornelius $9,450 in attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to Â§ 15-77-300.Â  County appeals both orders.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1)\r\n        Whether the circuit court erred in holding County was bound by the terms of the Referendum.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the circuit court abused its discretion in awarding Cornelius attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp; ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referendum\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution of 1895 placed control of local government affairs largely with the General Assembly.Â  Most notably, Article X, Â§6 of the 1895 Constitution allowed the General Assembly to grant counties the power to levy taxes only for specific listed purposes such as roads, prisons, education, courts, salaries of county officials, and other â€œordinary county purposes.â€Â  The intent of this provision was to â€œhalt county and township taxing and spending except that which was unequivocally for traditional local government purposes.â€Â  Underwood, The Constitution of South Carolina: Vol. II: The Journey Toward Local Self-Government at 83 (1989).Â  As a result, this Court strictly interpreted what constituted an â€œordinary county purposeâ€ for which state government could lawfully permit Â counties to levy taxes or issue bonds. See, e.g., Leonard v. Talbert, 225 S.C. 559, 83 S.E.2d 201 (1954) (act creating physical education commission and providing funding for sports fields for Richland County schools had neither educational nor â€œordinary county purposeâ€ within the meaning of Article X, Â§6).Â  In the same vein, because modern waste treatment practices were not known in 1895 and could not therefore have been an â€œordinaryâ€ county purpose, the Court construed Article X, Â§6 as prohibiting counties from expending tax revenues or bond funds to construct or operate sewerage systems.Â  Doran v. Robertson, 203 S.C. 434, 27 S.E.2d 714 (1943).Â  In 1973, the Constitution was amended and Article VIII, Â§ 16 was added as part of the quest for Home Rule. This Constitutional provision permits a county, upon majority vote of its electors, â€œto acquire by initial construction or purchaseâ€ and to â€œoperateâ€¦sewer systemsâ€¦.â€Â  As noted in Knight v. Salisbury, 262 S.C. 565, 574,Â  206 S.E.2d 875, 879 (1974), the provision removed the obstacles presented by Article X, Â§6 and Doran and â€œexpressly empowers counties to actâ€ in establishing sewer systems.Â  \r\nOconee County maintains that the purpose of Article VIII, Â§ 16 is to allow voters to decide whether a county should be permitted to initially engage in wastewater treatment functions.Â  County argues that since the Constitution refers to â€œinitial construction or purchase,â€ and since the Referendum referred only to â€œa wastewater treatment facility,â€ the Referendum only limits the funding sources County could use to construct the first facility and does not hinder County from using tax monies or other forms of financing to fund subsequent expansions of the facility or additional sewer system projects.Â  According to County, once the 1976 Referendum passed, County was free to expand its sewer system and service, and to fund that expansion in any way it chose.Â  We disagree. \r\nAs a general rule, once voters have approved a Referendum, a county may expand its sewerage system without further authorization from the electors.Â  See Johnson v. Piedmont Mun. Power Agency, 277 S.C. 345, 287 S.E.2d 476 (1982).Â  The question remains, however, whether such an expansion is subject to the express terms and limitations of the Referendum. \r\nWe hold that a county seeking to expand a utility cannot ignore the express terms of the Article VIII, Â§ 16 referendum that initially authorized the county to own and operate the utility.Â  As Justice Littlejohn observed in Johnson:\r\n\r\nThe people, speaking through a constitution, endeavor to protect their life, liberty and property by prescribing and limiting the powers of the government.Â  This acts as a bulwark of liberty for the protection of private rights.Â  The Constitution is the instrument of the people to protect themselves against the rule of man as contrasted with the rule of law.\r\nThe power of government to demand money from its people by way of taxation, or otherwise, is equivalent to the power to destroy.Â  \r\n277 S.C. at 356, 287 S.E.2d at 482 (Littlejohn, A.J., dissenting).\r\n\r\nThe Constitution forbids a county from owning and operating a sewer system unless county electors have approved the countyâ€™s assumption of this function by referendum.Â  While nothing in Article VIII, Â§16 requires that the referendum be phrased to restrict the sources of funding a county may use for a sewer system, here Oconee County chose to include such a restriction in the referendum it presented to the voters.Â  Accordingly, the voters of Oconee County approved the referendum, but only on the condition that specific, non-tax based financing be used to construct, operate, and maintain the sewer system. Â To now permit the County to use the fact of a favorable vote as a license to ignore the express terms of that referendum and deploy its general taxing power to finance expansion of the system would subvert the popular will and deprive â€œthe people [of the right] to protect themselves against the rule of manâ€¦.â€Â  \r\nCounty alternatively contends that a constitutional referendum is merely one of several methods by which a county may be authorized to provide sewer services.Â  County claims S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-55-1410(A) (2002) provides an independent basis upon which a county may opt to provide sewer services using ad valorem tax funds.Â  We disagree.Â  This statute was enacted in 1975 pursuant to the Constitutionâ€™s directive to the General Assembly to implement Home Rule, see Hospitality Assâ€™n of South Carolina v. County of Charleston, 320 S.C. 219, 464 S.E.2d 113 (1995), Â and provides the governmental framework for a county to operate a sewer system that has been initially authorized by constitutional referendum.Â  Cf. Murphree v. Mottel, 267 S.C. 80, 226 S.E.2d 36 (1976) (favorable Article VIII, Â§ 16 referendum is prerequisite for county operation of water or sewer facilities).Â  The statute does not permit a county to operate wastewater treatment facilities in the absence of a constitutional referendum.[2]\r\nCounty next contends that it can enlarge its sewer system utilizing ad valorem tax monies, citing S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 7, which states, â€œThe General Assembly shall provide by general law forâ€¦powersâ€¦of counties, including the power to taxâ€¦.â€Â  This general taxing provision does not prevail over the specific requirement of the constitutional referendum mandated by Â Article VIII, Â§ 16.Â  See Â S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 23 (â€œThe provisions of the Constitution shall be taken, deemed, and construed to be mandatory and prohibitory, and not merely directoryâ€¦â€). \r\nFinally, County points to its general authority to expend tax revenues in aid of economic development, including sewer services, as a separate basis upon which it may expand sewer services independent of the Referendum.Â  We disagree.Â  A countyâ€™s general taxing authority does not trump the constitutional requirement that electors approve the operation of sewer services by referendum. Cf. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992) (general constitutional provision does not overrule specific constitutional clause). \r\nWe therefore affirm the circuit court order holding that County is bound by the terms of the Referendum both geographically[3] and financially in expanding its wastewater treatment services and facilities.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneysâ€™ Fees\r\nCornelius was awarded $9,450 attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (2005).Â  County argues it acted with â€œsubstantial justificationâ€ because there are no preexisting judicial precedents on these issues, merely attorney general opinions, and that Cornelius was not a â€œprevailing partyâ€ in that this was merely a declaratory judgment action to define rights, duties, and obligations, and that therefore the fee award was improper.Â  We affirm the award.\r\nIn order to make an award under Â§ 15-77-300, the trial court must find: 1) the party seeking the award was the prevailing party; 2) the state agency Â acted without substantial justification; and 3) that no special circumstances make an award unjust. Jasper County Bd. of Educ. v. Jasper County Grand Jury, 303 S.C. 49, 398 S.E.2d 498 (1990).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to award or deny fees under Â§ 15-77-300 will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.  \r\nTaking Countyâ€™s arguments in reverse order, this Court has never held that Â§ 15-77-300 is inapplicable to declaratory judgment actions.Â  In fact, the Court has decided numerous declaratory judgment appeals where fees were sought pursuant to the statute.Â  See, e.g., City of Charleston v. Masi, 362 S.C. 505, 609 S.E.2d 301 (2005) (no prevailing party under statute where declaratory judgment action dismissed as moot); Eargle v. Horry County, 344 S.C. 449, 545 S.E.2d 276 (2001) (remanding declaratory judgment action for determination of statutory award); S.C. Tax Commâ€™n v. United Oil Marketers, Inc., 306 S.C. 384, 412 S.E.2d 402 (1991) (no abuse of discretion in denying award to non-prevailing party in declaratory judgment action).Â  While the statute specifically exempts certain types of suits, declaratory judgments are not among them.Â  A party whose position prevails in a declaratory judgment dispute with a state agency may be awarded fees under Â§ 15-77-300.\r\nThe trial court can award attorneysâ€™ fees under the statute only if it finds the State â€œagency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claimâ€¦.â€Â  Â§ 15-77-300(1).Â  An agency acts with â€œsubstantial justificationâ€ within the meaning of the statute when its position has a â€œreasonable basis in law and fact.â€ McDowell v. SCDSS, 304 S.C. 539, 542, 405 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1991).Â  Contrary to Countyâ€™s contention, the fact that novel issues were raised does not mean County was substantially justified in opposing Cornelius.Â  Declaratory judgment actions by their very nature often present novel questions.Â  See, e.g. Eargle, supra (authority of county administrator to suspend elected officialâ€™s employees); United Oil Marketers, supra (constitutionality of license tax incentive statute for gas/ethanol blend); Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 394 S.E.2d 709 (1990) (to define relationship between sheriffâ€™s office and county council).Â  Moreover, County cited no viable authority supporting its position that it was no longer bound by the Referendumâ€™s terms.Â  We agree with the circuit court that County acted without substantial justification, and no special circumstances render the attorneysâ€™ fee award unjust.\r\nWe find the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in awarding Cornelius fees under Â§ 15-77-300.Â  Jasper County, supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court orders holding County is bound by the terms of the Referendum and awarding Cornelius attorneysâ€™ fees are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Cornelius also contended that County intended to fund water projects.Â  The circuit court held County lacked authority to build or operate a water system, a holding not challenged on appeal.\r\n[2] Indeed, the last sentence of section 44-55-1410(A) plainly provides that â€œ[n]othing herein contained is intended to authorize the levy of taxes.â€ \r\n[3] Nothing in the Referendum or the circuit court order, however, limits Countyâ€™s authority to contract with other public or private entities to provide sewer services. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§44-55-1410(D); Â§ 6-15-20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26190","title":"Russell v.

Neil Robinson, of Robinson Law Office, of Charlotte; and Leo A. Dryer, Jr., of Dryer Law Offices, of Columbia, for Respondent Walker Scott Russell.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Â Â  The underlying litigation began when beneficiaries of an estate challenged the validity of a will and two trusts, alleging the documents were procured by undue influence.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.Â  This Court affirmed as modified.Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, 353 S.C. 208, 578 S.E.2d 329 (2003).Â  After remittitur was issued, certain defendants moved for summary judgment, seeking to enforce no-contest clauses appearing in the will and revocable trust.Â  The trial court denied summary judgment, ruling that the no-contest clauses were unenforceable because beneficiaries had probable cause to challenge the estate plan.Â  The court also issued two orders regarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  After certifying this case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, we affirm in part and reverse in part. \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nMildred Russell Neiman (Mim) and Walker Scott Russell (Scott) each filed actions to set aside the will, and revocable and irrevocable trusts of their father, Donald Stuart Russell (Testator).[1]Â  In general, the complaints alleged that Testator was unduly influenced and coerced by Mimâ€™s children (the Williams Children), and perhaps others, to design his estate plan as he did.Â  Named defendants included the following:Â  the Williams Children; Mimâ€™s ex-husband (Thad Williams); Wachovia Bank (Wachovia), the executor of the estate and the trustee; Testatorâ€™s wife, Virginia U. Russell (Mrs. Russell), who is now deceased; and Testatorâ€™s two other children, John R. Russell (Johnny) and Donald R. Russell, Jr. (Donnie).\r\nAfter extensive discovery was conducted, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.Â  This Court affirmed as modified, holding that the will and trusts were not procured by undue influence.Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, 353 S.C. 208, 578 S.E.2d 329 (2003). Â As to the will contest, we found that the record was â€œdevoid of any evidence that the Williams Children or Thad influenced the execution or any modification of the will.â€Â  Id. at 219, 578 S.E.2d at 335.Â  Similarly, as to the trust contest, we found that there was â€œno evidence to make out a prima facie case of undue influence . . . .â€ Id. at 224, 578 S.E.2d at 337.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing remittitur, the Williams Children filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to enforce the no-contest clauses appearing in Testatorâ€™s will and revocable trust.Â  Wachovia intervened, making similar arguments. Â Â The no-contest clauses provided that beneficiaries who challenged the validity of the will and trust documents would be disinherited.Â  Therefore, if enforced, these provisions would have the effect of disinheriting Mim and Scott for bringing the underlying actions.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing, the trial court issued three orders that are the subject of the present appeal.Â  In the first order, the trial court found that Scott and Mim had probable cause to believe that Testator had been unduly influenced by the Williams Children, and perhaps others, prior to his death.Â  As a result, the court ruled that the no-contest clauses were invalid and unenforceable.Â  Wachovia, Mrs. Russellâ€™s estate, Donnie, and Johnny appeal.Â Â Â  \r\nIn the second order, the trial court ordered Mim to pay attorneyâ€™s fees and costs incurred by Wachovia in the amount of $264,995.31, by her motherâ€™s estate in the amount of $147,110.25,[2] and by her brothers, Johnny and Donnie, in the amount of $97,412.83.Â  Mim appeals.Â  \r\nFinally, in the third order, the trial court denied a motion for sanctions filed against Scott and his attorneys.Â  The court also denied the Williams Childrenâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. Â The Williams Children appeal. \r\nAccordingly, the issues presented on appeal are as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Did the trial court properly grant summary judgment in favor of Mim and Scott, finding they had probable cause to contest the validity of the estate plan?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.      &nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court properly order Mim to pay certain attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;      &nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court properly deny the Williams Children&rsquo;s request for attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â  No-Contest Clauses\r\nWachovia, Mrs. Russellâ€™s estate, Donnie, and Johnny contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Mim and Scott, finding they had probable cause to contest the validity of the estate plan. Â We agree.\r\nIn general, clauses in a will designed to penalize beneficiaries for contesting a will or instituting other proceedings relating to the estate are valid and enforceable.Â  E.g., Cox v. Fowler, 614 S.E.2d 59 (Ga. 2005); In re Estate of Mumby, 982 P.2d 1219, 1224 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999).Â  Commonly referred to as â€œno-contestâ€ or â€œin terroremâ€[3] clauses, such clauses may â€œprotect estates from costly and time-consuming litigationâ€ and â€œminimize the bickering over the competence and capacity of testators, and the various amounts bequeathed.â€Â  In re Estate of Seymour, 600 P.2d 274, 278 (N.M. 1979).Â  No-contest clauses may have the desirable effect of ensuring that the details of a testatorâ€™s private life are not made public.Â  Cf. Smithsonian Instit. v. Meach, 169 U.S. 398, 402-03 (1898) (stating that will contests frequently bring â€œto light matters of private life that ought never to be made publicâ€).Â Â  \r\nBut courts in South Carolina and North Carolina,[4] along with a majority of jurisdictions, have recognized an exception to the general rule that no-contest clauses are valid and enforceable.Â  Under South Carolina law, a no-contest clause is unenforceable if the challenger has probable cause for instituting proceedings.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-905 (1986).Â  Similarly, North Carolina law provides that a no-contest clause is unenforceable against a person who in good faith and with probable cause challenges the validity of a will.Â  Ryan v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., 70 S.E.2d 853, 856 (N.C. 1952).Â  \r\nIn the South Carolina case of Rouse v. Branch, the Court held that beneficiaries contesting a will on the ground that the will was a forgery did not forfeit their right to inherit.Â  91 S.C. at 118, 74 S.E. at 135.Â  In so holding, the Court explained: \r\n\r\n  The right of a contestant to institute judicial proceedings upon probable cause, to ascertain whether the will was ever executed by the apparent testator, is founded upon justice and morality.Â  If a devisee should accept the fruits of the crime of forgery, under the belief, and upon probable cause, that it was a forgery he would thereby become morally a particeps criminis; and yet if he is unwilling to commit this moral crime, he is confronted with the alternative of doing so, or of taking the risk of losing all, under the will, in case it should be found not to be a forgery.Â  \r\n  Public policy forbids that he should be tempted in such a manner.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Accordingly, if a beneficiary has a belief, based on probable cause, that a will constitutes a forgery, the beneficiary may (and should) contest the validity of the will, without fear of being disinherited under the terms of a no-contest clause. \r\nLikewise, beneficiaries are permitted to make bona fide inquiries into whether a will was procured through undue influence or duress. Â In the North Carolina case of Ryan v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., six of testatorâ€™s ten children contested the will, alleging that testatorâ€™s signature was obtained through undue influence and duress, and that testator was not even capable of executing the document.Â  70 S.E.2d at 853.Â  Testator was ninety-years old when he died; he was worn out and feeble; was unable to work for several years prior to his death; and, at times, did not recognize his children.Â  Id. at 854.Â  Evidence was also submitted that for several years prior to testatorâ€™s death, two of his daughtersâ€”who were among the chief beneficiaries under the willâ€”were always present when testatorâ€™s other children visited him.Â  Based on this evidence, the court held that a subsequent action challenging the validity of the will was brought in good faith and based on probable cause.Â  Accordingly, the no-contest clause was unenforceable against the challenger.Â  Id.\r\nIn so holding, the court explained: \r\n\r\n  In our opinion, a bona fide inquiry whether a will was procured through fraud or undue influence, should not be stifled by any prohibition contained in the instrument itself. \r\n  . . . \r\n  There is a very great difference between vexatious litigation instituted by a disappointed heir, next of kin, legatee or devisee, without probable cause, and litigation instituted in good faith and with probable cause, which leads the contestant to believe that a purported will is not in fact the will of the purported testator.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 856-57.Â  \r\nIn the present case, Testator amended both his will and revocable trust approximately fifteen months before he died to include provisions disinheriting beneficiaries who contested the validity of his estate plan.Â  Accordingly, the second codicil to the will provides:\r\n\r\n  Should any beneficiary of this Will or of the trust agreement . . . contest the validity of this Will or any provision thereof or attempt to prevent any provision from being carried out in accordance with its terms in legal proceedings or otherwise, then any interest provided for such beneficiary and his or her descendents is revoked and such beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me for all purposes under this Will.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the revocable trust was amended to provide:\r\n\r\n  Should any beneficiary of this trust contest the validity of this trust or any provision thereof or attempt to prevent any provision thereof from being carried out in accordance with its terms in legal proceedings or otherwise, then any interest provided herein for such beneficiary and his or her descendents in this trust is revoked and such beneficiary and his or her descendents shall be deemed to have predeceased me for all purposes under this trust.\r\n\r\nDespite the existence of these provisions, two of Testatorâ€™s children, Mim and Scott, each filed lawsuits alleging that the will and trust documents were procured by undue influence.Â  After extensive discovery was conducted, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.Â  This Court affirmed.Â  \r\nAfter remittitur was issued, defendants moved for summary judgment seeking to enforce the no-contest clauses.Â  After a hearing, the trial judge found that Mim and Scott â€œhad sufficient evidence to support their reasonable beliefâ€ that Testator had been unduly influenced.Â  In support of this ruling, the court cited the strife and discord in the family, particularly between Mim and her children, the Williams Children.Â  The court also noted that Mim and Scott were treated less advantageously under the estate plan than they believed Testator had intended.[5] Â Accordingly, the judge granted summary judgment in favor of Mim and Scott, finding that they had probable cause to challenge the estate plan.Â  As a result, the judge ruled that the no-contest clauses were invalid and unenforceable.Â  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  The evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. at 493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mim and Scott, we hold that summary judgment was improperly granted.Â  Mim and Scott did not have probable cause to bring the underlying actions.Â  Family discord and strife, coupled with a less-than-favorable inheritance, do not constitute probable cause.Â  Moreover, the fact that Testator did not announce that the Williams Children would share in the estate is not reason to believe he was unduly influenced to favor them.Â  \r\nAny suspicions Mim and Scott may have had about the influence of others over Testator should have been dispelled by the overwhelming evidence of Testatorâ€™s abilities.Â  Unlike the testator in Ryan, Testator maintained his physical and mental health up until his death.Â  He continued to serve as a federal judge, driving himself to and from work.Â  He was fully capable of executing testamentary documents.Â  He maintained his independence, was freely permitted to come and go from his home and office as he desired, having opportunities to visit relatives, friends, and business associates without supervision. \r\nTherefore, because we find that Mim and Scott lacked probable cause to contest the estate plan, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment.Â  Consequently, we find that the no-contest clauses in both the will and trust are valid and enforceable. To hold otherwise would undermine Testatorâ€™s intent.Â  See Matter of Clark, 308 S.C. 328, 417 S.E.2d 856 (1992) (explaining that the cardinal rule for interpreting and construing a will is the determination of the testatorâ€™s intent).Â  \r\nThere is evidence throughout the record that Testator anticipated that certain beneficiaries would contest the validity of his estate plan.Â  He told his attorney and his son, Donnie, that he anticipated a challenge.Â  He asked one of his former law clerks to represent the Williams Children in the event a challenge was brought.Â  He even went so far as to have himself examined by a psychiatrist to create a record of his testamentary capacity.Â  And most importantly, he amended his will and revocable trust to include language explicitly providing that beneficiaries who contested the validity of the estate plan would have their interest revoked and â€œshall be deemed to have predeceased [him].â€[6]Â  In sum, he did all that he could have to ensure that his wishes would be respected.Â  If a no-contest clause cannot be upheld under these facts, such a clause would not ever be enforceable.Â  \r\nTherefore, by giving the no-contest clauses their full, intended effect, we honor Testatorâ€™s wishes.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanctions Against Mim\r\nThe trial court found that Mim improperly continued the litigation of this case, even after she realized that the facts did not support her claims.Â  Consequently, the court ordered Mim to pay certain attorneyâ€™s fees and costs incurred from the point in the litigation that she should have realized the lawsuit was frivolous.Â  We agree with the imposition of sanctions.[7]\r\nSanctions were imposed pursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act (FCPSA)[8] and Rule 11 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (SCRCP).Â  \r\nThe FCPSA provides:\r\n\r\n  Any person who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of any civil proceeding is subject to being assessed for payment of all or a portion of the attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs of the other party if:\r\n  (1) he does so primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the claim upon which the proceedings are based; and\r\n  (2) the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking an assessment of the fees and costs.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (Supp. 2002) (emphasis added).Â  A party continues litigation with a proper purpose if he â€œreasonably believes in the facts upon which his claim is based and . . . relies upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and given after full disclosure of all facts within his knowledge . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-20 (Supp. 2002).Â  When reviewing a trial courtâ€™s decision to impose sanctions under the FCPSA, this Court takes its own view of the evidence.Â  Father v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Services, 353 S.C. 254, 260, 578 S.E.2d 11, 14 (2003).\r\nAfter the complaints in the present case were filed, defendants submitted the following information to the plaintiffs and to the court:Â  (1) an affidavit from Testatorâ€™s attorney, who drafted the will and trust documents; (2) affidavits from Testatorâ€™s colleagues on the Fourth Circuit; (3) an affidavit from one of Testatorâ€™s personal friends, a former Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court; (4) an affidavit from Testatorâ€™s personal physician; and (5) copies of all of Testatorâ€™s estate documents, dating back until the late 1950s.\r\nThe affidavit of Testatorâ€™s attorney established that Testatorâ€™s final will and trust documents reflected Testatorâ€™s desires.Â  The attorney described Testator as â€œcompetent, alert, and capable of making independent decisions.â€Â  The attorney also stated that Testator â€œwas aware of the extent and nature of his property, maintained control over his property and understood in detail his business affairs . . . .â€Â  Affidavits from Testatorâ€™s colleagues and friends confirmed that Testator maintained both his independence and intellect up until his death.Â  Testatorâ€™s physician, who observed Testator six weeks before his death, described Testator as â€œindependent and clear thinking, showing no signs of mental incapacity.â€Â  Moreover, he stated that Testator â€œnever complained . . . that he was mistreated by any personâ€ and never showed signs of physical abuse.Â  Finally, documents produced from Wachoviaâ€™s files revealed that over the course of four decades, Testator had never treated his children equally in his estate plans.\r\nThe trial court ruled that, based on this information, Mim should not have continued the litigation.Â  We agree.Â  The affidavit from Testatorâ€™s attorney made it clear that the estate plan represented Testatorâ€™s wishes.Â  Other affidavits confirmed that Testator was fully capable of thinking for himself and executing his testamentary documents as he desired. Â Mimâ€™s argument that she continued the litigation on the advice of counsel is without merit because subsequent discovery revealed that she was not entirely honest with her attorneys.Â  Therefore, we hold that the trial court properly imposed sanctions pursuant to the FCPSA.\r\nMim was also sanctioned pursuant to Rule 11, SCRCP, for submitting an affidavit that the trial court later described as â€œfalse.â€Â  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s assessment of the affidavit and therefore hold that the court properly imposed sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  Rule 11(a) provides, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  The signature of an attorney or party [on a pleading, motion, or other paper] constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion or other paper; that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.\r\n  . . .\r\n  If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this Rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee. Â \r\n\r\nOn appeal, the imposition of sanctions pursuant to this rule will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Runyon v. Wright, 322 S.C. 15, 19, 471 S.E.2d 160, 162 (1996).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion may be found if the conclusions reached by the court are without reasonable factual support.â€Â  Id. \r\nWe hold that the trial court properly awarded sanctions pursuant to Rule 11.Â  Mimâ€™s own deposition testimony directly contradicts statements made in her affidavit.Â  In the affidavit, Mim stated that Testator â€œalways promised and intended to treat his children equally with regards [sic] to his estate.â€Â  She also stated that the Williams Children prevented her from seeing Testator.Â  Finally, she attested that the Williams Children had been violent and abusive toward Testator.\r\nEach of these statements was later contradicted in Mimâ€™s deposition testimony, demonstrating that the affidavit she signed and submitted to the court was not based on knowledge, information, or belief that there were grounds to support it.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Mim to pay reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs from the time defendantsâ€™ summary judgment motion was first argued, until the time when summary judgment was granted.[9]\r\nTherefore, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s imposition of sanctions against Mim.Â  \r\nIII.Â  The Williams Children\r\nLike the other defendants, the Williams Children moved for sanctions pursuant to the FCPSA and Rule 11.Â  But the court ruled that the Williams Childrenâ€™s motion was filed too late.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, a trial judge loses jurisdiction[10] over a case when the time to file post-trial motions has elapsed.Â  Ex parte Beard, 359 S.C. 351, 358, 597 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An order is not final until it is entered by the clerk of court; and until the order or judgment is entered by the clerk of court, the judge retains control of the case.Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 22, 624 S.E.2d 643, 646 (2006).Â  As a result, a motion for sanctions must be filed within ten days of the notice of entry of judgment.Â  Pitman v. Republic Leasing Co., Inc., 351 S.C. 429, 432, 570 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 2002).[11]Â  \r\nIn the present case, the trial judge signed the order granting summary judgment on April 27, 2001.Â  That same day, the trial judge faxed a letter to all attorneys, including the Williams Childrenâ€™s attorneys, notifying them that the order was being filed that day.Â  In addition, the clerk of court file-stamped the judgment sheet on April 27, indicating that the order was filed that day.Â  However, judgment was not entered by the clerk until May 8, 2001.Â  \r\nThe Williams Children filed their motion for sanctions on May 14, 2001, which is within the ten day time limit.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion.Â  Accordingly, the issue of sanctions pursuant to the FCPSA and Rule 11 should be remanded to the trial court.\r\nConclusion\r\nBecause Mim and Scott did not have probable cause to contest the estate plan, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment in their favor.Â  We also hold that the trial court properly imposed sanctions against Mim.Â  However, we hold that the trial court erred in declining to address the issue of sanctions sought by the Williams Children.Â  Therefore, the issue of sanctions is remanded to the trial court for a decision on its merits.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Perry M. Buckner, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Testator served as an active judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit until his death on February 22, 1998, at the age of 92.Â  Prior to his appointment to the federal bench, Testator served as governor of South Carolina, United States senator from South Carolina, and President of the University of South Carolina.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] This award was later increased to $165,060.68, after the court realized that the original award did not include costs.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[3] â€œTechnically, a no-contest clause is only one type of in terrorem clause, the latter term including any clause seeking to coerce a person into taking or refusing to take some action.â€Â  Martin D. Begleiter, Anti-Contest Clauses:Â  When You Care Enough to Send the Final Threat, 26 Ariz. St. L.J. 629, n. 2 (1994).Â  The terms are typically used interchangeably, but we use the term â€œno-contestâ€ throughout this opinion because the clauses in the present case specifically address the consequences of contesting the estate plan.\r\n[4] In our prior opinion, we held that issues surrounding the will were governed by South Carolina law, and issues surrounding the trust were governed by North Carolina law.Â  Because the no-contest clauses appear in both the will and trust, we analyze this issue under the law of each state.Â  In the end, however, we find that the legal standard is the same under both South and North Carolina law. \r\n[5] Testatorâ€™s estate totaled approximately $33,000,000.Â  Upon Mrs. Russellâ€™s death, Scott was to receive $750,000 in trust for life.Â  Testatorâ€™s other sons, Donnie and Johnny, were each to receive a one-third share of the remaining balance.Â  Mim, however, was to share the remaining one-third of the balance equally with her children, the Williams Children, in trust for life.Â  The estate plan also directed that upon Mimâ€™s death, funds remaining in her trust would pass to the Williams Children. Â \r\n[6] Because the no-contest clauses at issue in this case provided that, in the event of a dispute, oneâ€™s interest would be given over to another, the clauses were not merely in terrorem but were also intended to effect a forfeiture.Â  See Mallet v. Smith, 27 S.C. Eq. (3 Rich. Eq.) 12 (1853) (explaining that when a clause merely states that beneficiaries shall not dispute the terms of a will, the clause is considered in terrorem, and forfeiture will not result; but when a clause also provides for the giving over of oneâ€™s interest in the event of a dispute, then a forfeiture will result).\r\n[7] We have held that the litigation was initiated without probable cause.Â  However, we award attorneysâ€™ fees and costs only for the period requested.\r\n[8] We recognize that the General Assembly recently amended or repealed various sections of this Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (Supp. 2005).Â  Nonetheless, we apply the law as it existed at the time judgment was entered.\r\n[9] Because we hold that Mim (and Scott) lacked probable cause from the outset to bring the underlying actions, we would support an award of reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs spanning the entire litigation of this case.Â  But since we have been asked only whether the trial court properly awarded fees and costs measured from the time summary judgment was first argued until the time it was granted, we affirm the amount awarded, limited as it may be.\r\n[10] Jurisdiction refers to the trial courtâ€™s authority to retain jurisdiction over the case, not the courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See Ex parte Beard, 359 S.C. at 358.Â  (explaining that the ten day rule is a time limitation on the courtâ€™s ability to retain the case not the power of the trial court to hear cases of that nature).\r\n[11] We do distinguish between the FCPSA and the Rule 11 sanctions.Â  There is no requirement that a motion for sanctions made pursuant to Rule 11 be made within ten days from notice of entry of judgment.Â  See Ex parte Beard, 359 S.C. at 359-60, 597 S.E.2d at 839 (holding that a motion for sanctions pursuant to the FCPSA must be filed within ten days of notice of entry of judgment but not a motion under Rule 11).Â  As a result, we decline to address what time limit is proper with regard to the Rule 11 sanctions because the issue is not before us.Â  However, since the motion made pursuant the FCPSA is proper it is only logical that the Rule 11 motion was timely according to Ex parte Beard.Â  See The Father v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 345 S.C. 57, 72, 545 S.E.2d 523, 531 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating that criteria for Rule 11 sanctions are essentially the same as those for sanctions under the FCPSA).Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26191","title":"In the Matter of Kenneth Ray Martin","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26191","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary matter in which the Court imposed a public reprimand.","date":"2006-07-24","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Kenneth Ray Martin, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26191\r\nSubmitted June 26, 2006 - Filed July 24, 2006Â  \r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Michael J. Virzi, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Jason B. Buffkin, of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to reinstatement of the Deferred Disciplinary Agreement under a renewed schedule, an admonition, or a public reprimand.Â  We accept the Agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nSince his admission to the practice of law in 1999, respondent has been a sole practitioner.Â  In January 2002, Client A retained respondent to represent her in a claim to recover money and property from a former boyfriend.Â  During the representation, respondent failed to ensure that his office had a system for accurate recordation and retention of incoming telephone messages and he lost documents related to Client Aâ€™s case.Â Â Â  \r\nRespondent admits that, from January through June 2002, his only action on behalf of Client A was the preparation of one demand letter; he concedes, however, that he has no proof that he actually prepared the letter.Â  Respondent further admits he knowingly failed to respond to Client Aâ€™s inquires regarding the status of her case.Â  \r\nIn July 2002, respondent sent a letter to Client A informing her that he did not have time to handle her case.Â  He returned all fees paid by Client A and advised her regarding the statute of limitations.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDuring its investigation of this matter, respondent knowingly failed to respond to two separate telephone messages from ODC, but otherwise fully cooperated with ODCâ€™s investigation into this matter.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nOn August 27, 2004, respondent entered into a Deferred Disciplinary Agreement in resolution of the grievance discussed above. Respondent agreed as follows:Â  1) to retain the services of a law office management advisor approved by ODC within fifteen days; 2) to file with ODC an initial report by the advisor within sixty days; and 3) that failure to comply with the terms of the agreement would constitute misconduct.Â  An Investigative Panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct accepted the Deferred Disciplinary Agreement and, by letter dated September 30, 2004, ODC notified respondent that the deadlines in the agreement would be measured from September 30, 2004. \r\nRespondent did not meet the deadlines for hiring a law office management advisor and filing a report with ODC.Â  Respondent states he had spoken with an advisor and that his failure to hire the advisor was due to his inability to pay the fee.Â  Respondent made no attempt to contact ODC to request an extension of time or otherwise discuss the matter until contacted by ODC several months later.Â  \r\nThe deferment contained in the Deferred Disciplinary Agreement was subsequently revoked and the grievance reopened.Â  Nevertheless, respondent represents that, on his own initiative, he hired a law office management advisor who completed a review of his office procedures and that he has implemented the advisorâ€™s recommendations.Â Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nIn May 2004, respondent was retained by Client B for purposes of a warranty matter.Â  At the time, respondent told Client B he hoped the matter would be resolved in six months.Â  Respondent sent a letter to the defendant in May 2004.Â  \r\nClient B alleges he contacted respondent in October 2004, at which time respondent assured him he would call the following Monday and brief him on the status of the warranty matter.Â  Despite the promise, respondent failed to contact Client B during the remainder of 2004.Â  \r\nOn April 12, 2005, Client B contacted respondent.Â  Respondent informed him that his warranty had expired in January 2005 but that respondent had preserved his claim prior to that date.Â  Respondent failed to provide Client B with any documents or other evidence of claim preservation.Â  \r\nRespondent represents Client Bâ€™s claim is preserved and he continues to represent Client B in this matter.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, particularly Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation), Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail to comply with the terms of a finally accepted deferred disciplinary agreement).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26192","title":"In the Matter of David G.

Thomas Hill. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE ANDERSON:Â  Russ and Lee Pye, along with their partnership, Justin Enterprises (the Pyes), initiated this action against the Estate of Dorothy T. Fox, the Estate of John C. Fox, John Richard Fox, III (the Foxes), and attorney G. Thomas Hill, alleging (1) abuse of process, (2) civil conspiracy, and (3) a violation of the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act, S.C. Code Ann. section 15-36-10.Â  The circuit court dismissed Hill from the action at the summary judgment stage, and directed a verdict in favor of the Foxes at the close of the Pyesâ€™ case.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Pyes own two adjacent parcels of land, known as Encampment Plantation and Encampment Plantation Drive, located on Highway 17 in Charleston County.Â  The Foxes have an easement for ingress and egress over Encampment Plantation Drive which allows them access from their land to Highway 17.Â  At least one additional parcel separates the Pyesâ€™ land from the Foxesâ€™.Â Â  \r\nDr. Southard owns property adjacent to the Pyes and has an easement over Encampment Plantation Drive.Â  Soon after Southard purchased his tract he began requesting that the Pyes alter the travel lane over Encampment Plantation Drive.Â  Due to the layout of the lane, Southard was forced to make a ninety-degree turn in order to access his property.Â  Southard engaged in logging on the land, and the cumbersome ninety-degree turn inhibited access for the logging trucks.Â  \r\nInitially, the Pyes resisted Southardâ€™s request to realign the travel lane.Â  According to Mrs. Pyeâ€™s testimony at trial, Southardâ€™s proposal would have required the removal of one of several â€œGrand Treesâ€ which were protected by a county ordinance.Â  However, an Act of God intervened when lightening struck one of the Grand Trees.Â  As a result, the Pyes realigned the lane on Encampment Plantation Drive to turn at a forty-five-degree angle and pass over where the fallen Grand Tree once stood.Â  The Pyes planted shrubbery to cover the former path.Â  Despite the Pyesâ€™ rearrangement of the travel lane, several lawsuits ensued.Â  \r\nOn February 27, 2002, attorney Hill filed suit 02-CP-10-903, which was captioned Estate of John Carlton Fox v. Justin Enterprises, A South Carolina General Partnership, Russ Pye and Lee Pye (Suit 903).Â  However, John Carlton Foxâ€™s estate was already closed.Â  Therefore, Suit 903 was eventually dismissed.Â  On May 16, 2002, civil action number 02-CP-10-2131 (Suit 2131) was filed.Â  Suit 2131 alleged the same causes of action as Suit 903, but was captioned Estate of Dorothy T. Fox, John Richard Fox, III, as Personal Representative, John Richard Fox, III, and Developments Unlimited, LLC.Â  The Foxes were dismissed as plaintiffs from Suit 2131 on December 19, 2002, but the action continued with Dr. Southardâ€™s company, Developments Unlimited, LLC, as the sole plaintiff.Â  \r\nThus, the Foxes filed two lawsuits against the Pyes, but they were eventually dismissed from both suits.Â  Hill represented the Foxes in each action.Â  Based on these lawsuits, the Pyes initiated the case sub judice against the Foxes for abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and violation of S.C. Code Ann. section 15-36-10, the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act, and against Hill on the civil conspiracy and frivolous proceedings act claims.Â  \r\nHill moved for summary judgment on the civil conspiracy cause of action.Â  The circuit judge granted the motion reasoning the Pyes stated the same claim under the frivolous proceedings act.\r\nSubsequently, Hill filed a motion for summary judgment on the frivolous proceedings act claim.Â  The court scheduled the summary judgment motion in conjunction with the Pyesâ€™ Rule 59 motion to alter or amend.Â  The Pyes agreed to withdraw the frivolous proceedings act claim based on In re Beard, 359 S.C. 351, 597 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The court of appeals, in In re Beard, held that the Frivolous Proceedings Sanctions Act was subject to the general ten-day limitation for post-trial motions.Â  Thus, the Pyesâ€™ claim under the act was time barred.Â  \r\nThe court then heard the Pyesâ€™ Rule 59(e) motion.Â  The judge previously had granted summary judgment finding the civil conspiracy claim was adequately addressed by the frivolous proceedings cause of action.Â  According to the Pyes, because the frivolous proceedings claim was not viable, the basis for the courtâ€™s decision did not apply.Â  The following colloquy occurred at the hearing:\r\n\r\n  The Court:Â  What are you suggesting that he did outside of his duty as a lawyer?Â  Thatâ€™s the problem.Â  I didnâ€™t hear anything that he did, or didnâ€™t do, that wasnâ€™t really tied to what his responsibilities were to his client.\r\n  Ms. Hunt:Â  Essentially, Your Honor, the evidence sets forth in my memoranda, that Mr. Hill had conversations with Mr. Fox prior to filing the lawsuit that Mr. Foxâ€”Mr. Fox testified in his deposition that he actually took it upon himself to file the lawsuit and that he didnâ€™t inform him that the estate was closed.Â  He acted outside that realm when he takes it upon himself to give people permission to enter upon the plaintiffsâ€™ property to measure treesâ€”he venturedâ€”heâ€™s outside that attorney-client relationship byâ€”\r\n  . . . .\r\n  The Court:Â  [D]o you have any proof that he gave them permission to go anywhere outside the easement?\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ms. Hunt:Â  No, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n  The Court:Â  Okay.Â  Then as long as it is confined to the easement, then he had a duty to do what he did.Â  Okay. Thank you.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ms. Hunt:Â  Thank you, Your Honor.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Court:Â  I deny the Motion to Reconsider.Â  \r\nThe case was tried before a jury with two causes of action surviving against the Foxesâ€”abuse of process and civil conspiracy.Â  At the close of the Pyesâ€™ case, the Foxes moved for a directed verdict.Â  The court found no evidence of an ulterior purpose or willful abuse of process in the proceedings the Foxes initiated.Â  Therefore, the judge directed a verdict on the abuse of process claim.Â  The Pyes do not appeal this ruling.Â  Next, the circuit court addressed the civil conspiracy claim:\r\n\r\n  As to the conspiracy, I understand the dilemma here, Ms. Hunt, and I understand youâ€™re contemplating appealing that.Â  I realize that situation.Â  There is no evidence, because Mr. Hill had been dismissed prior to this lawsuit.Â  So there was noâ€”you couldnâ€™t have really had any testimony concerning that.Â  So, thereâ€™s no evidence concerning a conspiracy on the part of Mr. Fox.Â  He canâ€™t conspire with himself.Â  That being the case, the Court would also grant the directed verdict as to the conspiracy action and, therefore, directs a verdict for the Defendant in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe Pyes present two issues on appeal: (1) whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to dismiss the civil conspiracy cause of action against Hill; and (2) whether the circuit court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the Foxes.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary Judgment\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 611 S.E.2d 922 (2005); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 609 S.E.2d 565 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 608 S.E.2d 587 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nDirected Verdict\r\nIn ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.Â  The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should have been denied.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003); Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995).Â  In deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or nonexistence of evidence.Â  Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15, 567 S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nThis Court will reverse only where there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling, or where the ruling was controlled by an error of law.Â  Clark v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Public Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 382-83, 608 S.E.2d 573, 576 (2005); Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999); Abu-Shawareb v. S.C. State Univ., 364 S.C. 358, 613 S.E.2d 757 (Ct. App. 2005); Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Essentially, this Court must resolve whether it would be reasonably conceivable to have a verdict for a party opposing the motion under the facts as liberally construed in the opposing partyâ€™s favor.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 309, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002); Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Summary Judgment\r\nA.Â  Issue Preservation\r\nThe Pyes contend the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Hill.Â  \r\nGenerally, â€œan attorney is immune from liability to third persons arising from the performance of his professional activities as an attorney on behalf of and with the knowledge of his client.â€Â  Gaar v. North Myrtle Beach Realty Co., Inc., 287 S.C. 525, 528, 339 S.E.2d 887, 889 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  In Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1995), this Court held â€œan attorney may be held liable for conspiracy where, in addition to representing his client, he breaches some independent duty to a third person or acts in his own personal interest, outside the scope of his representation of the client.â€Â  \r\nFor the first time on appeal, the Pyes allege that Hill breached an independent duty owed to them.Â  According to the Pyes, Hill owed the Pyes a duty based on Rule 11, SCRCP and S.C. Code Ann. section 16-17-10, the barratry statute. This issue was not presented to or ruled upon by the trial judge and is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nIt is well settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved.Â  See generally Holy Loch Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 531 S.E.2d 282 (2000); Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 529 S.E.2d 543 (2000).\r\nThe Pyes raise for the first time on appeal the theory that Hill should be held liable for civil conspiracy on the basis of a duty he owed to them.Â  They did not present this issue at the initial summary judgment hearing or at the Rule 59(e) hearing.Â  Therefore, this issue is not properly before us, and we will not consider it now for the first time on appeal.Â Â Â  \r\nThe theory the Pyes did raise to the trial judge at the Rule 59(e) hearing was that Hill should be held liable for acting outside the scope of his professional duties and in his own interest.Â  In support of this argument the Pyes presented two factual incidents: (1) Hill allegedly asked Fox to join in litigation against the Pyes and then filed a lawsuit in the name of the Estate of John Carlton Fox without Richard Foxâ€™s permission; and (2) Hill granted a third party permission to enter Encampment Plantation Drive to take some measurements.Â  The circuit court specifically addressed the granting permission to enter the land and declared that act was not outside the scope of Hillâ€™s representation of his client.Â  The Pyes do not appeal this aspect of the judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\nThe court did not address Hillâ€™s alleged solicitation of Fox or his filing of the lawsuit without the clientâ€™s knowledge.Â  Hill contends that because the circuit court did not rule on this issue at the Rule 59(e) hearing, it is not preserved.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nGenerally, an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be preserved.Â  Elam v. S. Carolina Depâ€™t of Trans., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (noting a party must file a Rule 59(e) motion â€œwhen an issue or argument has been raised, but not ruled on, in order to preserve it for appellate reviewâ€).Â  However, an exception to this rule exists where an issue is raised but not ruled upon at a Rule 59(e) hearing.Â  In Coward Hund, the court of appeals explained:\r\n\r\n  â€œThe purpose of Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment[,] is to request the trial judge to â€˜reconsider matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.â€™â€Â  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992) (quoting Budinich v. Becton Dickinson and Co., 486 U.S. 196, 200, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988)).Â  As one authority has noted, â€œOnce the issue has been properly raised by a Rule 59(e) motion, it appears that it is preserved and a second motion is not required if the trial court does not specifically rule on the issue so raised.â€Â  James F. Flanagan South Carolina Civil Procedure 475 (2d ed. 1996).\r\n\r\nCoward Hund Const. Co., Inc. v. Ball Corp., 336 S.C. 1, 4, 518 S.E.2d 56, 58 (Ct. App. 1999 (emphasis added); see also Collins Music Co., Inc. v. IGT, 353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d 524 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Coward Hund).Â  In Pressley v. Lancaster County, 343 S.C. 696, 542 S.E.2d 366 (Ct. App. 2001), the court of appeals, citing Coward Hund, applied this principle when the court addressed the merits of an argument which Pressley raised at trial and in a Rule 59(e) motion, but which the trial court â€œsummarily denied.â€Â  See Pressley, 343 S.C. at 706 n.4, 542 S.E.2d at 371 n.4.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Professor Flanagan further edifies:\r\n\r\n  One commentator noted:Â  â€œLawyers cannot force a trial judge to address a disputed issue.â€Â  Moreover, the Supreme Court identifies two ways to preserve the issue:Â  â€œa ruling by the trial judge or a post-trial motion.â€Â  The language implies that a properly requested ruling under Rule 59 is sufficient without a specific judicial decision on the matter.Â  \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Civil Procedure 475-76 (2nd ed. 1996) (footnotes omitted) (quoting Charles E. Carpenter, Jr. Preserving Error for Appeal, South Carolina Lawyer, 15, 18 (Mar./Apr. 1995) and Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 427 S.E.2d 673 (1993)).\r\nIn the instant case, the Pyes raised the issue whether Hill acted outside the scope of his professional responsibilities by allegedly soliciting Fox to join in litigation against the Pyes and by filing the suit without Foxâ€™s knowledge.Â  The Pyes asserted this theory both at the summary judgment hearing and the Rule 59(e) hearing.Â  Consequently, this issue is preserved for our review, even though the circuit judge did not rule on the theory.Â  \r\nB.Â  Civil Conspiracy\r\nThe elements of a civil conspiracy in South Carolina are (1) the combination of two or more people, (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, (3) which causes special damages.Â  LaMotte v. Punch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 370 S.E.2d 711 (1988); Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 49, 619 S.E.2d 437, 453 (Ct. App. 2005); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Peoples Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assâ€™n of S. Carolina v. Resources Planning Corp., 358 S.C. 460, 470, 596 S.E.2d 51, 56-57 (2004) (â€œA civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more parties joined for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and thereby causing special damage.â€) (citation omitted).Â  It is essential that the plaintiff prove all of these elements in order to recover.Â  Lyon v. Sinclair Refining Co., 189 S.C. 136, 200 S.E. 78 (1938).Â  The â€œessential considerationâ€ in civil conspiracy â€œis not whether lawful or unlawful acts or means are employed to further the conspiracy, but whether the primary purpose or object of the combination is to injure the plaintiff.â€Â  Lee v. Chesterfield General Hosp., Inc., 289 S.C. 6, 13, 344 S.E.2d 379, 383 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nâ€œ[I]n order to establish a conspiracy, evidence, direct or circumstantial, must be produced from which a party may reasonably infer the joint assent of the minds of two or more parties to the prosecution of the unlawful enterprise.â€Â  Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 601, 358 S.E.2d 150, 153 (Ct. App. 1987); accord Cowburn, 366 S.C. at 49, 619 S.E.2d at 453.Â  This Court has observed:\r\n\r\n  Conspiracy may be inferred from the very nature of the acts done, the relationship of the parties, the interests of the alleged conspirators, and other circumstances.Â  Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 358 S.E.2d 150 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  â€œCivil conspiracy is an act which is by its very nature covert and clandestine and usually not susceptible of proof by direct evidence. . . .â€ Id. at 601, 358 S.E.2d at 153.Â  An action for civil conspiracy is an action at law; the trial judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld on appeal unless they are without evidentiary support.Â  Gynecology Clinic v. Cloer, 334 S.C. 555, 514 S.E.2d 592 (1999).\r\n\r\nPeoples Federal, 358 S.C. at 470, 596 S.E.2d at 57.\r\n\r\nThe gravamen of the tort of civil conspiracy is the damage resulting to the plaintiff from an overt act done pursuant to the combination, not the agreement or combination per se.Â  Lee, 289 S.C. 6, 344 S.E.2d 379.Â  â€œ[A]n unlawful act is not a necessary element of the tort.â€Â  Id. at 11, 344 S.E.2d at 382.Â  Because the quiddity of a civil conspiracy claim is the damage resulting to the plaintiff, the damages alleged must go beyond the damages alleged in other causes of action.Â  Vaught v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201, 387 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nAlthough the theory of Hillâ€™s scope of representation is properly preserved, we do not need to reach this issue.Â  Instead, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment under Rule 220(c), SCACR and Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000).Â  The Pyes failed to establish the elements of civil conspiracy.Â  There was absolutely no evidence submitted at the summary judgment stage supporting an agreement between Hill and Richard Fox to injure the Pyes.Â  The only evidence the Pyes proffered to establish that Hillâ€™s actions were outside the scope of his representation is the following statement from Richard Foxâ€™s deposition testimony:Â  â€œI stopped by Mr. Hillâ€™s office and he asked me if we wanted to get involved in opening the road and I said yes.Â  And at the timeâ€”I should have probably given him more information but he took it on his own and thatâ€™s when he filed it under my fatherâ€™s estate which had already been closed.â€Â  Yet, even in a light most favorable to the Pyes, Richard Foxâ€™s statement does not establish any wrongful intent by the Foxes to injure the Pyes.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s summary judgment on the basis that the Pyes failed to offer proof of an agreement between Hill and the Foxes to injure the Pyes.Â  \r\nII.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nAt the conclusion of the Pyesâ€™ case, the circuit court directed a verdict for the Foxes on civil conspiracy, finding that since Hill had been dismissed from the case, there could be no testimony about a conspiracy.Â  The Pyes maintain that Hillâ€™s immunity from liability does not eviscerate their case against the Foxes for conspiracy.Â  They claim the court should have considered the evidence of conspiracy against the Foxes rather than directing a verdict.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR and Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000).\r\nAfter reviewing the evidence presented at trial, we conclude the Pyes failed to satisfy the elements of civil conspiracy.Â  The Pyes did not proffer any evidence of an agreement by Hill and the Foxes to injure the Pyes.Â  A directed verdict is proper where the evidence raises no issues for the jury as to liability.Â  See Carolina Home Builders, Inc. v. Armstrong Furnace Co., 259 S.C. 346, 358, 191 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1972).Â  Therefore, we affirm the courtâ€™s directed verdict in favor of the Foxes based on the Pyesâ€™ failure to present evidence of a necessary element of civil conspiracy.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHillâ€™s liability based on a duty owed to the Pyes was never raised to the circuit court and is not preserved for our review.Â  Although the court did not rule on the issue of whether Hill ambulated outside the scope of his professional duties, the argument was raised at the summary judgment hearing and at the Rule 59(e) hearing.Â  Consequently, the issue is adequately preserved.Â  However, because the Pyes failed to offer evidence on all of the elements of civil conspiracy, we affirm summary judgment.Â  Similarly, we affirm the directed verdict in favor of the Foxes for failure to submit any evidence establishing a necessary element of civil conspiracy.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26194","title":"Edwards v.

Edwin McDonnell, of McDonnell &amp; Noll, LLC, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  This is a direct appeal from the family courtâ€™s order granting appellant $7,410.28 in past due child support, but denying appellantâ€™s other claims, including a request for compound interest on the child support award.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s order in material part.Â  However, because appellant is entitled to post judgment interest, we remand this matter to the family court for a calculation of simple post judgment interest on the $7,410.28 award of past due child support.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant Lisa Rea Edwards (Mother) and respondent Robert Keith Campbell, Jr. (Father) married in August 1981 and had two sons, one in July 1982 and the other in January 1985.Â  The parties separated, however, and finalized their divorce in 1990.Â  Pursuant to their separation agreement, Father agreed to pay $576.52 per month in child support beginning November 1, 1990.Â  In addition, the parties agreed that Father would keep health insurance coverage for the two children and pay the childrenâ€™s medical bills.\r\n In 1993, Mother brought a contempt action against Father.Â  After a hearing, the family court ordered Father to pay, inter alia:Â  (1) $205.34 for past due medical bills of the children; (2) $1,867.32 for an outstanding MasterCard debt; and (3) $5,077.00 still owed for property division.Â  \r\nThe instant case relates to Motherâ€™s November 2003 filing of a Rule to Show Cause wherein she claimed Father owed her the following:Â  (1) $38,230.81 in past due child support and alimony;[1] (2) $49,714.15 in unpaid medical bills; (3) $7,830.92 stemming from Fatherâ€™s failure to pay the medical bills and property division items in the 1993 Order; and (4) $24,535.16 in â€œother child obligationsâ€ including expenses for the elder sonâ€™s three-year attendance at Camden Military Academy.Â  \r\nThe family court held a hearing on the Rule to Show Cause in September 2004.Â  Relying on an article published in the South Carolina Lawyer,[2] Mother specifically requested that the family court award compound interest for the past due child support and medical bills.\r\nThrough her own testimony and exhibits, Mother claimed that Father was $17,390.16 in arrears on child support; with compound interest, she calculated that Father owed a total of $34,831.23 in past due child support.Â  Regarding past due medical expenses, Mother stated that Father owed $5,678.28.Â  With compound interest, Mother calculated that Father owed a total of $11,002.86 for the medical expenses.Â  Mother also testified that Father owed her on the property division and medical bills portions of the 1993 Order, with the addition of post judgment interest.Â  Finally, Mother stated that Father owed her for half of various other expenses for the children, including non-tuition costs associated with the elder sonâ€™s attendance at Camden Military. Â \r\nOn cross-examination, Mother testified to the following, inter alia:Â  (1) her older son turned 18 in 2000; (2) her younger son turned 18 in January 2003; and (3) she collected child support through May 2003.Â  In addition, at the time of the hearing, Mother owed a substantial amount of money in unpaid taxes.[3]Â  Finally, Mother acknowledged that in the 1993 action, no mention was made regarding any past due child support from 1990 onward; yet in the instant action, she was claiming past due child support from April 1990 through May 2003.\r\nFather testified at the hearing that:Â  (1) he overpaid Mother by at least $20,000 or $24,000; (2) he carried insurance on his sons until they were 18; (3) he usually took the children to the doctor; and (4) he was not given medical bills that he did not pay.Â  Father also testified that although he did not have a record of it, he paid by check within 30 days of the 1993 Order what the court had determined he should pay.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the family court judge indicated she had â€œcredibility issues with bothâ€ parties.Â  In the written order, the family court made the following pertinent findings regarding Motherâ€™s past due child support claim:Â  (1) Father did not overpay Mother, but â€œhe owes her substantially less than she claims;â€ (2) the amount owed by Father would begin with February 1993 because no child support delinquency was found in the 1993 Order; (3) Mother was entitled to $67,452.84 in child support; (4) according to Motherâ€™s own exhibit, Father paid Mother $55,100.00; (5) because Father never sought a reduction in child support when the older child turned 18 in July 2000, Father would be given a $4,942.56 credit; and (6) therefore, Father owed Mother $7,410.28 in past due child support.Â  \r\nThe family court specifically denied Motherâ€™s claim for compound interest.Â  In addition, the family court denied Motherâ€™s request for medical expenses.Â  Finally, the family court found Motherâ€™s testimony was not credible regarding her claim that Father did not pay the medical bills and property division items from the 1993 Order.Â  \r\nThe family court ordered that the $7,410.28 owed by Father for past due child support should be paid through the Spartanburg County Clerk of Court â€œat the rate of $200.00 per month, plus a five percent collection cost for a total of $210.00 per month.â€Â  Beyond the denial of Motherâ€™s request for compound interest, there was no specific mention of post-judgment interest in the family courtâ€™s order.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the family court err by denying compound interest on the past due child support, or in the alternative, was it error to fail to award simple post judgment interest?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMother argues that the family court erred in failing to award â€œsome formâ€ of post judgment interest from the date each child support payment became due.Â  Moreover, Mother claims she is entitled to compound interest, or, if that request is denied by this Court, simple interest at the statutory rate.Â  While the family court correctly denied Motherâ€™s claim for compound interest, we agree Mother is entitled to simple post judgment interest.\r\nIt is well-settled that â€œfixed awards of money for equitable distribution shall accrue interest at the post-judgment rate from the date of the judgment, or in the case of specified periodic payments from the date each payment becomes due and owing.â€Â  Casey v. Casey, 311 S.C. 243, 245-46, 428 S.E.2d 714, 716 (1993) (emphasis added).Â  In Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 492 S.E.2d 86 (1997), this Court made clear that while Casey involved an equitable division award, the same principle applies to past due alimony and child support.Â  We explained as follows:\r\n\r\n  Here, Husband was ordered in the 1982 divorce decree to make monthly payments of alimony and child support to Wife.Â  That decree constituted the â€œjudgmentâ€ ordering the periodic payments. Â The fact that Wife had to get a contempt order in 1994 because of Husband's failure to meet his alimony and child support obligations does not mean the 1994 order was the first judgment ordering such payments.Â  To alter the interest requirement in the way Husband suggests would reward Husband for failing to meet his obligations when they were due.\r\n\r\nId. at 114, 492 S.E.2d at 96.Â  Thus, the Casey principle applies to periodic payments such as child support, and the interest is calculated on each installment from the time each payment became due.[4]Â  Id.; see also Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 102, 529 S.E.2d 14, 17 (2000) (â€œWhere the law allows interest as a matter of course, it is unnecessary to make demand for it in the pleadingsâ€). \r\nIn this case, the family court denied Motherâ€™s request for compound interest.Â  Mother argues that the pertinent subsection of the post judgment interest statute is â€œpenal in natureâ€ and therefore should be interpreted as providing for compound interest.Â  In addition, Mother argues that based on the statutory language in effect at the time these child support judgments came due, the interest should be compounded annually. Â We disagree.\r\nSection 34-31-20(B) of the S.C. Code provides for post judgment interest.Â  Prior to 2001, the legal post judgment interest rate was â€œfourteen percent per annum;â€ the statute was amended in 2000, and as of January 1, 2001, the rate became â€œtwelve percent a year.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (1987 &amp; Supp. 2000) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nMother contends that because of two late nineteenth-century cases, the above-emphasized language in the statute means that the interest should be compound, rather than simple.Â  See Bowen v Barksdale, 33 S.C. 142, 11 S.E. 640 (1890); Carolina Sav. Bank v Parrott, 30 S.C. 61, 8 S.E. 199 (1888).Â  The Parrott and Bowen cases, however, are inapposite to the issue of whether the language of the post judgment interest statute authorizes compound interest.[5]Â  Instead, we believe that if the Legislature intended for interest to be compounded in a certain way pursuant to Section 34-31-20(B), â€œit could have plainly said so.â€ Â Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 277, 625 S.E.2d 636, 640 (2006) (finding that charging a flat rate of interest on redeemed properties was intended where the statute did not specify that the interest be compounded).\r\nIndeed, we note that the Legislature amended Section 34-31-20(B) just last year, and this section now provides as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  A money decree or judgment of a court enrolled or entered must draw interest according to law. Â The legal rate of interest is equal to the prime rate as listed in the first edition of the Wall Street Journal published for each calendar year for which the damages are awarded, plus four percentage points, compounded annually.â€¦Â  This section applies to all judgments entered on or after July 1, 2005.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§34-31-20(B) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).\r\nGiven that the Legislature has only recently expressed a clear intent that post judgment interest be â€œcompounded annually,â€ the family court properly denied Motherâ€™s request for compound interest.Â  See Buist, supra (if Legislature had intended certain result in statute, it would have said so); see also Hainer v. American Med. Intâ€™l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 134, 492 S.E.2d 103, 106 (â€œThis Court cannot construe a statute without regard to its plain and ordinary meaning, and may not resort to subtle or forced construction in an attempt to limit or expand a statuteâ€™s scope.â€).\r\nIn sum, the family court did not err in denying Motherâ€™s request for compound interest.Â  However, because the post judgment interest statute applies to family court judgments relating to periodic payments such as child support, Mother is entitled to post judgment interest from the date each child support payment came due.Â  See Thornton, supra; see also Casey, supra (where no contrary provision is made by the family court, a domestic money judgment bears post judgment interest at the statutory rate).\r\nAccordingly, we remand this matter to the family court to calculate simple post judgment interest on the $7,410.28 child support award.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Mother is entitled to simple post judgment interest on the $7,410.28 award of past due child support. Â Therefore, we remand this matter to the family court for a calculation of post judgment interest from the time each payment became due.Â  See Thornton; supra; Casey, supra.\r\nREMANDED.[6]\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The partiesâ€™ separation agreement provided alimony for Mother in the amount of $200 per month.Â  Mother remarried in May 1992.\r\n[2] See Gregory S. Forman, Contingency Fees and Interest in Collecting Back Child Support and Alimony, 14-May S.C. Law. 27 (May 2003) (hereinafter â€œthe Forman articleâ€).Â  Mother submitted the article to the family court as an exhibit.\r\n[3] Mother testified that she had a manufactured home sales company but it was no longer in business.Â  Her financial declaration listed that she owed over $214,000 to the IRS and over $116,000 to the S.C. Dept. of Revenue.Â  Fatherâ€™s counsel questioned Mother about $700,000 in recorded federal tax liens. Â \r\n[4] We note, however, Caseyâ€™s emphasis on the fact that the family court retains considerable discretion regarding the award of interest:\r\n\r\n  We leave intact the family courtâ€™s broad discretion to provide for the payment of interest as part of the equitable distribution award.Â  Thus, the family court may provide for the amortization of payments with a rate of interest different from the post-judgment rate or deny interest altogether on payments due at a future date.â€¦Â  Where, however, no contrary provision is made by the decreeing court, a domestic money judgment bears post-judgment interest at the statutory rate.\r\n\r\nCasey, 311 S.C. at 246, 428 S.E.2d at 716.\r\n[5] The Parrott case indicates that charging â€œinterest upon interestâ€ at a rate above the usury law might be permissible in a written agreement between two private parties without violating the usury law, but it would not be appropriate for a bank to charge above the statutory usury rate.Â  Stated another way, a bank is allowed to compound interest annually on a loan, as long as this is specifically stated in the contract and the rate does not exceed the usury law.Â  See Tate v. Lenhardt, 110 S.C. 569, 96 S.E. 720, 722 (1918) (after Parrott, it became the common practice for banks and money lenders to expressly agree to compound interest). Â Similarly, the Bowen case involved an issue regarding the rate of interest a promissory note should bear after maturity of the obligation.Â  Bowen stands for the proposition that private parties may expressly agree to a rate of interest that is higher than the statutory rate, and also may contract to have the interest compounded.\r\n[6] Appellantâ€™s remaining issues are affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Issues 3 and 4: Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005) (this Court is not required to ignore the fact that the family court judge, who actually saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate credibility and assign comparative weight to the witnessesâ€™ testimony); Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981) (this Courtâ€™s broad scope of review in family court cases does not require the Court to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, and it does not relieve the appellant of the burden of convincing this Court that the family court committed error).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Randolph Frails","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2006-07-18-01","description":"Reinstatement to the practice of law.","date":"2006-07-25","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of Randolph Frails, Petitioner.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPetitioner was suspended on June 12, 2006, for a period of sixty (60) days, credited against his more-than-six-month interim suspension.
