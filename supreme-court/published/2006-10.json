McCord III, of McCord, Busbey &amp; Ketchum. L.L.P, of Tallahassee, Florida, for appellants.\r\nJohn M.S. Hoefer, Mitchell Willoughby, and Noah M.

Mahon, Jr., of SCANA Corporation, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellants (Landowners) commenced this class action against respondent (SCE&amp;G) for trespass, unjust enrichment, an injunction, and declaratory judgment.Â  Landowners claim SCE&amp;Gâ€™s conveyance of excess capacity on its fiber optic cables was anÂ  improper use of the electric easements granted by Landowners to SCE&amp;G.Â  The trial judge granted SCE&amp;Gâ€™s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) must be based solely on the allegations set forth in the complaint and we must presume all well-pled facts to be true.Â  Overcash v. South Carolina Elec. and Gas Co., 364 S.C. 569, 614 S.E.2d 619 (2005).Â  The complaint here alleges the following.\r\nLandowners granted easements to SCE&amp;G giving SCE&amp;G â€œthe right to construct, operate, and maintain electric transmission lines and all telegraph and telephone lines . . . necessary or convenient in connection therewith. . . .â€[1]Â  Sometime in the 1990â€™s, SCE&amp;G began installing fiber optic communications lines on its existing poles in these easements.Â  Fiber optic lines do not carry electricity but transmit digital signals.Â  After setting up this communications network,[2] Â SCE&amp;G began conveying excess fiber optic capacity to third-party telecommunications companies without notice or compensation to Landowners.Â  \r\nLandownersâ€™ complaint further alleges that the easements granted to SCE&amp;G do not include the right to apportion any part of these easements to third parties for general telecommunications purposes.Â  Landowners do not contest SCE&amp;Gâ€™s installation and use of the fiber optic lines for its own internal communications.Â  \r\nFor purposes of the motion to dismiss, the trial judge accepted as true the allegation that the language of the easements does not allow third-party communications, but found the written easements were not determinative in light of this Courtâ€™s precedent in Lay v. State Rural Electrification Auth., 182 S.C. 32, 188 S.E. 368 (1936), Leppard v. Central Carolina Tel. Co., 205 S.C. 1, 30 S.E.2d 755 (1944), and Richland County v. Palmetto Cablevision, 261 S.C. 222, 199 S.E.2d 168 (1973).Â  The trial judge concluded these cases stand for the proposition that utility easements â€œconfer a broad right to use the utility easement for additional purposesâ€ and therefore SCE&amp;Gâ€™s conveyance was authorized as a matter of law.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDoes the holder of a utility easement have the right to apportion part of its own use to third-parties as a matter of law and without reference to the written easements?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOur resolution of this case rests on our reading of Lay, Leppard, and Palmetto Cablevision.Â  Since we must presume as true the allegation that the language of the easements does not allow SCE&amp;G to convey use of its fiber optic cable to third parties, the issue is whether these cases allow apportionment of the use of a utility easement as a matter of law despite the language of the written easements.\r\nIn Lay, a 1936 case, we considered whether the placing of an electric line on a highway easement constituted an additional servitude.Â  At issue was an Act of the General Assembly allowing the Rural Electrification Authority to install electric lines in any public highway.Â  The plaintiff landowners contended it was a taking without compensation to allow this additional servitude of the easements granted to the State â€œfor highway purposes.â€ Â We Â held the placement of electric lines in the highway easements did not constitute an additional servitude because communication was within the traditional use of a highway.Â  There was no issue regarding whether the written easements in Lay prohibited an apportionment of use to third parties.Â  We simply held the erection of electric lines was not an additional servitude to easements that were granted â€œfor highway purposes.â€Â  \r\nIn 1944, we decided the Leppard case which involved\r\nÂ§ 8531 of the 1932 Code, now S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-2020 (1977).Â  This section provides:Â  \r\n\r\nAny telegraph or telephone company. . . may construct, maintain and operate its line . . . under, over, along and upon any of the highways or public roads of the State . . . .\r\n\r\nThe complaining landowner had previously conveyed â€œan unqualified right of wayâ€ to the State Highway Department.Â  The issue was whether the erection of telephone lines in the highway easement was an additional servitude entitling the landowner to compensation.Â  We followed our earlier decision in Lay and concluded the erection of telephone poles and lines within the highway easement was not an addition servitude and no compensation was due.Â  Again, no restrictive language in the underlying easement was involved.Â  \r\nThe third case, Palmetto Cablevision, was decided in 1973.Â  Palmetto Cablevision did not involve private landowners but was an action by Richland County (County) essentially seeking to assert Countyâ€™s authority over cable television services.Â  Cablevision had an agreement with a telephone company to use the telephone companyâ€™s poles and rights-of-way and was required under the terms of that agreement to obtain consent from the State and private landowners, but not from County.Â  \r\nWe found Countyâ€™s permission to use these easements was not required and, even if it was, the facts indicated such permission was actually given.Â  199 S.E.2d at 172.Â  We held that the telephone companyâ€™s easement was very broadly defined by statute and the stringing of additional cables for newly conceived communication uses was authorized without Countyâ€™s permission.[3]Â  199 S.E.2d at 173.Â  In essence, we found the television cables did not constitute an additional servitude on the underlying telephone easements.Â  Again, the case did not involve restrictive language in the easements.[4]\r\nSCE&amp;G would have us read these three cases as standing for the proposition that the use of a utility easement may be apportioned as a matter of law without reference to the language of the easement itself.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, Lay, Leppard, and Palmetto Cablevision, while settling the issue of an additional servitude, did not involve restrictions on the apportionment of an allowed use.Â  As other courts have noted, the issue of apportionment is a slightly different issue from that of additional servitude.Â  Where an easement is granted for some category ofÂ  use, for instance â€œhighway purposes,â€ the question of an additional servitude addresses whether some new use fits within that category of allowed use, a question that may turn simply on an evaluation of the new use rather than an interpretation of the easementâ€™s language.Â  Apportionment, on the other hand, involves the interpretation of a restriction on the easement holderâ€™s conveyance of part of its own allowed use to a third party.Â  See Jackson v. City of Auburn, 2006 WL 893617 at 9 (Ala. App. 2006) (use of fiber optic line in electric easement may be apportioned when language in instrument indicates right to apportion and when apportionment is not additional servitude); City of Orlando v. MSD-Mattie, L.L.C., 895 So.2d 1127 (Fla. App. 2005) (use of fiber optic cable not an additional servitude but cannot be apportioned under language of instrument granting easement); McDonald v. Mississippi Power Co., 732 So.2d 893 (Miss. 1999) (same); see also Lighthouse Tennis Club Village Horizontal Prop. Regime LXVI v. South Island Pub. Serv. Dist., 355 S.C. 529, 586 S.E.2d 146 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding that language of easement restricted use of easement).Â  \r\nHere, there is no real issue of an additional servitude -- Â Landowners concede the fiber optic lines are within the use allowed under the terms of the easements.Â  Rather the issue is whether SCE&amp;G may apportion its allowed use to third parties.Â  This is clearly an issue that cannot be resolved without construing the instruments granting the easements in question.Â  It is well-settled that the rights of an easement holder depend upon the interpretation of the grant in the easement.Â  Patterson v. Duke Power Co., 256 S.C. 479, 183 S.E.2d 122 (1971).Â  Moreover, were we to read our earlier decisions as broadly as SCE&amp;G suggests, the owner of a servient estate could never limit the grant of a utility easement, no matter how specific the language in the easement.Â  \r\nFurther, SCE&amp;G argues it can apportion its use of the easements to third parties because the easements in question are commercial easements in gross which are alienable as a matter of law.Â  This is not entirely correct.Â  Even with such an easement, the court will look at the language of the easement to determine whether there was an intention to attach the attribute of assignability by the use of such language as â€œto his heirs and assigns.â€Â  Sandy Island Corp. v. Ragsdale, 246 S.C. 414, 143 S.E.2d 803 (1965) (parties may make an easement in gross assignable by the terms of the instrument; commercial easement in gross assignable where language included â€œsuccessors and assignsâ€); Douglas v. Medical Investors, Inc., 256 S.C. 440, 182 S.E.2d 720 (1971) (commercial easement in gross assignable where instrument included â€œhis heirs and assignsâ€).Â  Here, the easements attached to Landownersâ€™ complaint do state a conveyance to SCE&amp;G and â€œits successors and assigns.â€Â  While this language indicates assignability, the language limiting the use of the easement to communications necessary to SCE&amp;Gâ€™s business appears to restrict that assignability.Â  This ambiguity requires construction of the written easements themselves.Â  \r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s order dismissing Landownersâ€™ complaint is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDouglas E. Gressette and Mark E.

Barth, of Ballenger, Barth &amp; Hoefer, LLP, ofÂ  Florence, for respondent.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand or definite suspension not to exceed two (2) years.Â  We accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for one hundred and eighty (180) days.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was admitted to the practice of law in South Carolina in 1991.Â  He was employed as a shareholder in a law firm (the Firm) primarily engaged in representing clients insured by liability insurance companies.Â  The client in the cases mentioned hereafter was insured by an insurance carrier that paid the Firm the fees, costs, and expenses of the defense afforded to the insured client. \r\nOn approximately nineteen occasions between November 9, 2004, and August 13, 2005, respondent over billed the insurance carrier by including or causing to be included in its billing statement attorneys fees for traveling to depositions held out of town when, in fact, respondent knew he had participated in the depositions by telephone at the Firmâ€™s office.Â  In addition, respondent over charged the insurance carrier for costs by billing the carrier for mileage for traveling to the depositions on approximately seventeen of the nineteen occasions.[1]Â  \r\nThe overcharges came to light when respondentâ€™s secretary expressed concerns to the Firmâ€™s office manager who, in turn, reported the concerns to the Firmâ€™s senior partner.Â  The senior partner confronted respondent about the overcharges.Â  When confronted, respondent was immediately candid about the overcharges.Â  \r\nUpon discovering respondentâ€™s misrepresentation, the Firm reviewed its files and determined the overcharges had occurred in three files, all for the same client insured by the same insurance carrier.Â  The Firm estimated the amount of fees and costs over billed by respondent were $10,279.40.[2]Â  Thereafter, the senior partner made arrangements to meet with respondent, respondentâ€™s counsel, and ODC.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe next day, respondent, his counsel, and the senior partner met with ODC.Â  Respondent reported his misconduct.Â  Immediately upon returning to the Firmâ€™s office after the meeting, respondent wrote a personal check to the Firm in the amount of $10,279.40 which was to be paid by the Firm to the insurance carrier to reimburse it for the overcharges.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nWith respondentâ€™s assistance, the Firm compiled a complete and thorough report documenting respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  Respondent and the senior partner signed the report, certifying it to be correct and accurate.Â  The report was promptly furnished to ODC.Â Â  \r\nThe following day, at respondentâ€™s expense, respondent and the senior partner traveled out of state to the home office of the insurance carrier.Â  Respondent personally reported his misconduct and promised to provide the carrier with a copy of the report prepared for ODC.[3]Â  The Firm paid the carrier $10,279.40 without any preconditions or requests for a release. \r\nWith knowledge of the foregoing, the insurance carrier has continued to refer files for defense of its insured to the Firm and to respondent for defense and, in fact, has given respondent permission to continue working on the three files in which the overcharging occurred and on new files.Â  The Firm, however, has not allowed respondent to directly bill the insurance carrier and, instead, has had a shareholder review billing information complied by respondent prior to statements being submitted to the carrier.Â  \r\nRespondent has no previous disciplinary history.Â  To the best knowledge, information, and belief of ODC, respondent has been fully forthcoming in responding to questions about his misconduct to the Firm, the insurance carrier, and Disciplinary Counsel and has fully cooperated with its investigation.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to client); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall charge reasonable fees); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client, lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person); Rule 5.3 (with respect to a non-lawyer employee, lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the non-lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with professional obligations of the lawyer); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (lawyer shall not commit criminal act that reflects adversely on lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects);\r\nRule 8.4 (c) (lawyer shall not commit a criminal act involving moral turpitude);\r\nRule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice).\r\nÂ In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to bring legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer shall not violate the oath of office).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for one hundred and eighty (180) days.Â  Prior to his readmission, the Committee on Character and Fitness shall determine whether respondent has the requisite character and fitness to practice law in this state.Â  See Rule 32, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] ODC does not contend respondent personally benefited from the overcharge of the mileage expense.Â  \r\n[2] Respondent agrees this amount is correct.Â  Â Â \r\n[3] The report was subsequently provided to the insurance carrier.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

[4]Â  \r\nNations Title and Likens &amp; Blomquist employed several non-lawyers to perform title work and other closing-related work.Â  In addition to their regular salary, they were paid $75 per closing performed outside the office.Â  Respondent now acknowledges that many borrowers received inadequate legal advice as a result of this practice.Â  \r\nIn response to In the Matter of Lester, 353 S.C. 246, 578 S.E.2d 7 (2003), issued in March 2003, respondent attempted to bring office procedures into conformity with the requirement of attorney presence at all closings.Â  Respondent admits it took several months for these efforts to be successful and approximately two hundred refinancings were conducted in borrowersâ€™ homes by non-lawyer employees during April, May, and June of 2003 with no lawyer present.Â  \r\nRespondentâ€™s immediate response to the Lester opinion was to require any non-lawyer closer to telephone a lawyer during the closing to explain the HUD-1, note, mortgage, and three-day right of rescission to the borrower.Â  The borrowerâ€™s disclosure was altered to reflect the telephone call.Â  In the weeks following the Lester opinion, respondent sought advice from colleagues and ethics experts regarding his procedures and the impact of the Lester opinion, but obtained no definitive advice.Â  By the summer of 2003, respondent states he had eliminated the practice of non-lawyer closings.Â  \r\nLikens &amp; Blomquist experienced a high turnover rate for lawyer employees, with many leaving due to dissatisfaction with the lack of conformity with the requirements of the Rule of Professional Conduct and this Courtâ€™s pronouncements regarding real estate transactions.Â  In early 2004, in response to complaints from departing attorneys and threats of reporting Likens &amp; Blomquist to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, respondent again attempted to bring office procedures in conformity with applicable ethical rules, this time including ending the practices of false witnessing and in-house unsupervised out-of-state disbursement.Â  Respondent obtained counsel to review his procedures.Â  Respondent implemented the recommended changes, including physically separating the facilities of Nations Title from those of Likens &amp; Blomquist.Â  By way of mitigation and not as a defense, respondent states that he was not aware of all of the shortcomings or the extent of the problems, but he nonetheless accepts responsibility for them.Â  \r\nRespondent represents, and ODC does not dispute, that after June 2004, respondent made massive efforts to take control of Likens &amp; Blomquist and wrestle authority from the Nations Title managers and from the partners and managers in Kansas.Â  Ultimately, respondent left Likens &amp; Blomquist in Â 2005 due to his inability to force the firm to conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Courtâ€™s pronouncements regarding real estate transactions. \r\nRespondent recognizes that the actions of Nations Title and Likens &amp; Blomquist constituted the unauthorized practice of law and that, as the senior South Carolina attorney in the combined offices, he was responsible.Â  Nevertheless, although he was an employee of Likens &amp; Blomquist, the most senior South Carolina lawyer, and the supervisor of all other firm lawyers in South Carolina, respondent remained a subordinate of the non-lawyer managers of Nations Title.Â  As such, respondent did not have authority to countermand decisions regarding Likens &amp; Blomquistâ€™s policies and procedures, including the closing procedures described above. \r\nÂ Respondent has fully cooperated with ODCâ€™s investigation into this matter.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall explain matter to extent reasonably necessary to permit client to make informed decisions regarding representation); Rule 5.3 (lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of non-lawyer associates that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not assist others in performing activities which constitute the unauthorized practice of law); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct). Â In addition, respondent admits that his actions constitute grounds for discipline under the Rule 7 (a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for nine (9) months.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court demonstrating that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp; \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The case settled, accordingly, no issues were decided on appeal.Â  Respondent was not a party to the foreclosure action.\r\n[2] This had also become the Hall Law Firmâ€™s practice shortly before its sale to Nations Title. \r\n[3] Respondent had disseminated an official office policy requiring a second witness at every closing, but admits this policy was generally disregarded until mid-2004.Â  \r\n[4] It is unclear if Likens &amp; Blomquistâ€™s closing procedures were exactly the same as those of Nations Title.Â  Nevertheless, respondent fully accepts responsibility for real estate transactions which were conducted in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Courtâ€™s precedent while he was employed by Likens &amp; Blomquist.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of T.

Nichols, of Bluestein &amp; Nichols, LLC, of Columbia; and Stuart G. Anderson, Jr., and Robert M. Ariail, Jr., both of Anderson, Fayssoux and Chasteen, PA, of Greenville, for Plaintiff.\r\nC. Mitchell Brown and William C. Wood, Jr., both of Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough, LLP, of Columbia, for Defendant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  We accepted three questions certified by the United States District Court for South Carolina pursuant to Rule 228, SCACR.Â  The questions involve the applicability of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002) to an insurance policy providing liability coverage for only hired and non-owned vehicles used in the named insuredâ€™s business.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe facts are drawn from the district courtâ€™s certification order.Â  On June 2, 2002, Timothy Ross Howell (Plaintiff) was involved in an automobile accident while driving an automobile owned by his father.Â  Plaintiff was acting in the course and scope of his employment as a pizza delivery driver for Perfect Delivery, Inc. (â€œPerfect Deliveryâ€), a Papa Johnâ€™s franchisee, when the accident occurred.Â  \r\nOn the date of the accident, Perfect Delivery had an insurance policy (â€œFidelity policyâ€) in effect with Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance Company (Defendant).Â  Perfect Delivery was the named insured on the Fidelity policy, which provided liability coverage for non-owned and hired automobiles used in Perfect Deliveryâ€™s business.Â  Risk Services Corporation (â€œRisk Servicesâ€), a captive insurer of Papa Johnâ€™s International, issued the Fidelity policy to Perfect Delivery pursuant to a fronting agreement between Defendant and Risk Services.Â  At no time did Defendant, Risk Services, or anyone acting on their behalf ever offer to Perfect Delivery the opportunity to select or reject UIM coverage for inclusion in the Fidelity policy. \r\nPlaintiff asserts he is entitled to have the Fidelity policy reformed to include underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage up to the liability limit contained in the Fidelity policy because Defendant, or those acting on its behalf, failed to make an offer of UIM coverage to Perfect Delivery for that policy.Â  Defendant denies that Plaintiff is entitled to reformation of the Fidelity policy, alleging it did not have a duty to offer UIM coverage.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn answering a certified question raising a novel question of law, the Court is free to decide the question based on its assessment of which answer and reasoning would best comport with the law and public policies of this state and the Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and right.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2005)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same).\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n       Must an insurer offer underinsured motorist coverage to the named insured on an insurance policy covering only hired and non-owned vehicles which are utilized in the course and scope of the insuredâ€™s business?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.&nbsp;\r\n       Is the Fidelity policy at issue a â€œpolicyâ€ or a â€œpolicy of automobile insuranceâ€ as defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n        38-77- 30(10.5) (2002)?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      3.&nbsp;\r\n       Do S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 38-77-160 and -350 (2002) apply to the Fidelity policy at issue in this case?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe question we must decide is whether an insurer which provides liability coverage for only hired and non-owned vehicles must make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).Â  Section 38-77-160 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\nAutomobile insurance carriers shall offer, at the option of the\r\ninsured, uninsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insuredâ€™s liability coverage in addition to the mandatory coverage prescribed by\r\nSection 38-77-150.Â  Such carriers shall also offer, at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured\r\nliability coverage to provide coverage in the event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault insured\r\nor underinsured motorist or in excess of any damages cap or limitation Â Â  imposed by statute.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  In ascertaining the intent of the legislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider the language of the statute as a whole.Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  Statutes dealing with the same subject matter are in pari materia \r\nand must be construed together, if possible, to produce a single, harmonious result. Â Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000).Â  When a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its literal meaning.Â  Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994).Â  Â \r\nIn the context of statutorily required automobile insurance, a person or corporation in South Carolina must provide proof of financial responsibility for potential accidents to legally operate a motor vehicle.Â  This financial responsibility may consist of an insurance policy or surety bond with the required or optional coverages.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-10-10 to -40 and 56-10-210 to -280 (2006) (requiring proof of insurance or other acceptable security to register a motor vehicle and establishing fines and criminal penalties for failure to do so); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 38-77-140, -150, and -160 (2002) (establishing requirements of mandatory minimum insurance limits, mandatory uninsured motorist coverage, and requiring automobile insurers to offer additional uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, respectively); see also Croft v. Old Republic Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 402, 416-17, 618 S.E.2d 909, 916 (2005) (reciting the same principles). Â Â \r\nHowever, liability coverage for hired and non-owned vehicles is not statutorily required in this state and is provided by a voluntary contract between the insurer and the insured.Â  Therefore, the parties may choose their own terms regarding coverage for hired and non-owned vehicles.Â  Willis v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y., 253 S.C. 91, 97, 169 S.E.2d 282, 284-85(1969); Kraft v. Hartford Ins. Cos., 279 S.C. 257, 258, 305 S.E.2d 243, 244 (1983); S.C. Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 522, 548 S.E.2d 880, 885 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Â Â \r\nRegardless of whether an insurer is an automobile insurance carrier, Defendant contends because liability coverage for non-owned and hired vehicles is not statutorily required in this state, an insurer providing this type of voluntary coverage need not comply with Â§ 38-77-160.Â  We agree.\r\nConstruing the relevant statutory provisions together, we conclude an insurer must offer UIM coverage pursuant to Â§ 38-77-160 when the insurer extends statutorily required liability coverage.Â  See generally Miller v. Aiken, 364 S.C. 303, 309, 613 S.E.2d 364, 367 (2005) (concluding â€œthe â€˜meaningful offerâ€™ provision under Â§ 38-77-160 is triggered only when an insurer offers liability insurance and does not require an insurer providing only collision coverage to make an offer of UIM.â€).Â  However, we find an insurer providing solely voluntary liability coverage for hired and non-owned vehicles is not required to comply with Â§ 38-77-160.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude Â§ 38-77-160 does not require an insurer providing only voluntary liability coverage for hired and non-owned automobiles to make an offer of UIM.Â  Accordingly, we answer the first certified question: no.Â  Our disposition of this issue makes it unnecessary to address the remaining certified questions.Â  See Miller, 364 S.C. at 309, 613 S.E.2d at 367 (this Court does not need to address remaining questions when resolution of prior question is\r\ndispositive).\r\n CERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26214","title":"Doe Law Firm v.

McMaster, 355 S.C. 306, 585 S.E.2d 773 (2003) (McMaster), we refined the definition of the unauthorized practice of law in the context of residential real estate closings first set forth in State v. Buyers Serv. Co., Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 357 S.E.2d 15 (1987) (Buyers Service).Â  In McMaster and Buyers Service the Court identified four steps in a residential real estate closing that involve the practice of law:\r\n\r\n1)&nbsp; Title Search\r\nThe title search and preparation of title documents for the lender and subsequent preparation of related documents is the practice of law which must be performed or supervised by an attorney.\r\n2)&nbsp; Loan Documents\r\nA lender may prepare legal documents for use in financing or refinancing a real property loan so long as an independent attorney reviews them and makes any corrections necessary â€œto ensure their compliance with law.â€\r\n3)&nbsp; Closing\r\nReal estate closings and mortgage loan closings should be conducted only under an attorneyâ€™s supervision.Â  The supervising attorney may represent both the lender and the borrower after full disclosure and with each partyâ€™s consent.\r\n4)&nbsp; Recordation of Documents\r\nThe recording of documents is the â€œfinal phaseâ€ of the real estate loan process and must be done under the supervision of an attorney.\r\n\r\nIn both McMaster and Buyers Service the funds were disbursed directly by the lender pursuant to the HUD Settlement Statement, yet the Court did not define this step as one involving the practice of law.Â  As the parties candidly acknowledge, however, the disbursement process was not at issue in either case.Â  Similarly, several attorney disciplinary cases have implied, but not decided, that disbursement is the practice of law when performed in connection with a residential real estate loan closing.Â Â Â  See In re Boulware, 366 S.C. 561, 623 S.E.2d 652 (2005); In re Fortson, 361 S.C. 561, 596 S.E.2d 461 (2004); In re McMillian, 359 S.C. 52, 596 S.E.2d 494 (2004); In re Arsi, 357 S.C. 8, 591 S.E.2d 627 (2004); In re Pstrak, 357 S.C. 1, 591 S.E.2d 623 (2004); see also In re Boyce, 364 S.C. 353, 613 S.E.2d 538 (2005).\r\nViewed in isolation, it cannot be said that the disbursement of loan proceeds in and of itself â€œentail[s] specialized legal knowledge and ability,â€ such that it constitutes the practice of law.Â  Buyers Service, 292 S.C. at 430, 357 S.E.2d at 17.Â  In our view, however, the disbursement of funds in the context of a residential real estate loan closing cannot and should not be separated from the process as a whole.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the disbursement of the funds must be supervised by an attorney.Â  We do not specify the form that supervision must take, nor do we require that the funds pass through the supervising attorneyâ€™s trust account.Â  Rather, we hold that the attorneyâ€™s obligation to both his clients if he represents the buyer and the lender, and to his individual client if he represents only one party, includes overseeing this step of the closing process.Â  As explained above, we delay the effective date of this opinion until January 22, 2007 in order to afford persons with ongoing business relationships the opportunity to adjust their practices and procedures to conform to this new rule.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] See In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. 304, 422 S.E.2d 123 (1993) (Court will determine unauthorized practice of law questions in its original jurisdiction).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26215","title":"Arnal v.

Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 609 S.E.2d 821 (Ct. App. 2005). Â We affirm the Court of Appeals as modified.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nA complete recitation may be found in the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.Â  For purposes of this opinion, we briefly set forth the salient facts below.\r\nPetitioner (Mother) and Respondent (Father) married in 1995. Â Â Shortly after the birth of their son, the parties separated in late 1999.Â  After protracted and contentious litigation, the family court issued a final order in 2001.\r\nIn its final order, the family court imputed income[2] of $9,060.62 per month to Father for purposes of calculating child support.Â  Father and his financial expert had testified that his monthly income, minus business expenses, totaled roughly $4,000 per month.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the imputation of income, finding that Father was not voluntarily underemployed.Â  In making this finding, the Court of Appeals emphasized the lack of any evidence that Fatherâ€™s failure to earn additional income was due to a bad faith motivation to decrease his support obligation.Â  Arnal, 363 S.C. at 281, 609 S.E.2d at 828.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the family courtâ€™s imputation of income to Father for\r\nthe purposes of calculating child support?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Court of Appeals, exercising its own view of the facts,[3] correctly held that Father had not voluntarily lessened his earning capacity and reversed the family courtâ€™s decision to impute income to Father.Â  We affirm this finding but modify it to the extent that the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion may be read to require a bad faith motive as a prerequisite to proof of voluntary underemployment.[4]\r\nThe motive behind any purported reduction in income or earning capacity should be considered, but prior South Carolina appellate decisions do not preclude a finding of voluntary underemployment in instances where a spouse reduces his earning capacity without doing so in bad faith.Â  See Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 605 S.E.2d 572 (Ct. App. 2004) (affirming, without any discussion of bad faith, the imputation of minimum wage to stay-at-home mother who had to return to work after divorce); Robinson v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 461 S.E.2d 397 (Ct. App. 1995) (applauding Fatherâ€™s â€œcharitable resolveâ€ as a lawyer for indigent clients while nevertheless imputing income due to husbandâ€™s voluntary underemployment); Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 477 S.E.2d 727 (Ct. App. 1996) (affirming a finding of voluntary underemployment despite evidence that husband acted in good faith in leaving job as an accountant and later working as a delivery manager of telephone directories); and Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 539 S.E.2d 712 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting that motherâ€™s decision to pursue graduate degree was â€œadmirableâ€ but nonetheless imputing income because she voluntarily decreased her earning capacity in pursuit of her education).\r\nAccordingly, a parent seeking to impute income to the other parent need not establish a bad faith motivation to lower a support obligation in order to prove voluntary underemployment.Â  The presence of bad faith is a factor in determining whether a parent is voluntarily underemployed, but the lack of such bad faith does not preclude a finding of voluntary underemployment.\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that Father has not voluntarily lessened his earning capacity so as to justify the imputation of income due to voluntary underemployment.Â  The decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We dismiss certiorari as improvidently granted on the issues concerning equitable division, exclusion of evidence, and additional visitation.\r\n[2] Income may be imputed upon a finding that a party has voluntarily rendered himself underemployed.Â  See 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5), amended by State Register Volume 30, Issue 6, effective June 23, 2006.\r\n[3] See Allen v. Allen, 287 S.C. 501, 503, 339 S.E.2d 872, 873 (Ct. App. 1986) (stating Court of Appeals has jurisdiction in equity matters to find facts based on its own view of the evidence).Â  In this case, the Court of Appeals also made a factual finding concerning Fatherâ€™s deductible business expenses and determined that Fatherâ€™s yearly income totaled $59,010, or $4,917.50 per month.\r\n[4] The Court of Appealsâ€™ recent opinion, LaFrance v. LaFrance, Op. No. 4158 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 2, 2006) Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 34, also seems to require proof of a bad faith motivation to avoid a support obligation prior to a finding of voluntary underemployment.Â  We overrule those portions of that opinion inconsistent with our holding today.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26216","title":"Doctors Hospital of Augusta v.

Thomas Chase, of McAngus Goudelock and Courie, of Greenville, for Defendant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This is a certified question dealing with the workersâ€™ compensation commissionâ€™s (the Commissionâ€™s) jurisdiction to review a fee dispute between an insurance carrier and an out of state medical provider.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nAudrey Cooper (Employee), a South Carolina resident, suffered severe injuries when he encountered a high voltage electrical line in an on-the-job injury that occurred in South Carolina.Â  For approximately two months, Doctors Hospital of Augusta (Doctors Hospital), a privately owned limited liability company providing medical care and related services in Augusta, Georgia, treated Employee for his extensive injuries.\r\nEmployee was injured while working for a South Carolina company that procured workersâ€™ compensation insurance from CompTrust, a South Carolina self-insured workersâ€™ trust fund.Â  After admitting Employee to its facilities for treatment, Doctors Hospital contacted CompTrust to verify Employeeâ€™s insurance coverage and to obtain a guarantee of payment.Â  The insurance verification form used by Doctors Hospital provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nGeorgia Workers Compensation Fee Schedule only applies to Georgia Workers Compensation claims.Â  Out of state fee schedules do not apply to care rendered in Georgia hospitals.Â  Please be aware that our hospital will not accept, in satisfaction of our charges, Fee Schedule payments made pursuant to the workers compensation fee schedule of other states.\r\n\r\nAlthough the parties dispute the precise events relating to the guarantee of payment and verification of coverage, it is undisputed that CompTrust verified that it issued workersâ€™ compensation insurance covering Employee.Â  Doctors Hospital began treating Employee, and although CompTrust paid a portion of Employeeâ€™s medical bills associated with his treatment, at some point, CompTrust and Doctors Hospital reached an impasse regarding the total bill for Employeeâ€™s treatment.Â  Consequently, Doctors Hospital sued CompTrust in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to recover the unpaid balance of Employeeâ€™s medical bills. [1] \r\nCompTrust moved to dismiss the complaint, or alternatively, to stay the action, arguing that the Commissionâ€™s medical services division was the exclusive forum for resolving this fee dispute.Â  Pursuant to Rule 228, SCACR, this Court accepted the following certified question from United States District Judge G. Ross Anderson, Jr.:\r\n\r\nDoes the Commission have jurisdiction over fee disputes relating to fees charged by an out of state medical provider for services performed outside South Carolina relating to a workplace injury occurring in South Carolina, and, if it has jurisdiction, is it exclusive?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThis certified question asks whether the statutorily created process for resolving fee disputes between a workersâ€™ compensation insurer and a medical provider applies to an out of state medical provider who performs medical services outside of South Carolina relating to a workplace injury occurring in South Carolina.[2]Â  We answer â€œno.â€\r\nIn Ex parte First Pa. Banking &amp; Trust Co., 247 S.C. 506, 507-08, 148 S.E.2d 373, 374 (1966), this Court addressed the question of whether a South Carolina resident involved in an automobile accident in North Carolina could enforce a South Carolina â€œcollision lienâ€ statute against the at-fault driver, a Pennsylvania resident.Â  In holding that the statute did not apply, this Court stated â€œ[w]ith such exceptions which are without significance here, the jurisdiction of a state is restricted to its own territorial limits.â€Â  Id. at 508, 148 S.E.2d at 374 (citing 81A C.J.S. States Â§ 34).\r\nWe are not alone in honoring this principle.Â  Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has stated:\r\n\r\nThe several States are of equal dignity and authority, and the independence of one implies the exclusion of power from all others.\r\nAnd so it is laid down by jurists, as an elementary principle, that the laws of one State have no operation outside of its territory, except so far as is allowed by comity; and that no tribunal established by it can extend its process beyond that territory so as to subject either persons or property to its decisions.\r\n\r\nPennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 722 (1877).Â  Although the Supreme Court has redefined the scope of due process as it applies to a stateâ€™s ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident individual or entity since Pennoyer, see Schaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 196-204 (1977) (holding that due process does not require â€œphysical presenceâ€ in the forum state, but extends to persons possessing sufficient contact with a state which makes it reasonable to require them to defend a lawsuit there), the principle that state statutes generally have no extra-territorial effect remains a foundation of the respect for individual sovereignty the states must share with one another.\r\nIt is a bit perplexing that a South Carolina court was ever involved in this case.Â  This case involves a contract for medical services that was entered into and performed entirely in Georgia. As this Court has stated, â€œa contract is controlled by the laws of the State in which it is made and is to be performed.â€Â  Murphy v. Equitable Life Assurance Socâ€™y of the United States, 197 S.C. 393, 407, 15 S.E.2d 646, 651 (1941).Â  Of course, an out of state medical provider could contractually agree to be bound by the South Carolina workersâ€™ compensation statutes and procedures, but the construction of a contract is beyond the scope of the question certified to this Court.\r\nAccordingly, we answer that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over fee disputes relating to fees charged by an out of state medical provider for services performed outside South Carolina relating to an injury occurring in South Carolina.  [3] \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we answer â€œnoâ€ to the certified question in this case.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Specifically, Doctors Hospitalâ€™s sued for $911,430.58 outstanding on Employeeâ€™s total bill of $1,332,355.92.Â  \r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-90 (1985) provides that medical bills relating to injuries covered by workersâ€™ compensation are subject to the Commissionâ€™s approval.Â  This approval process is detailed in 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-1305 (Supp. 2005), which provides that a fee dispute between a medical provider and an employer or insurance carrier is referred to the Commissionâ€™s medical services division for a final resolution.Â  \r\n[3] Because this case raises a question only of the territorial limits of the authority of state statutes, we are not asked to decide the impact of regulation 67-1305 on this Courtâ€™s holdings in Baker Hosp. v. Firemans Fund Ins. Co., 314 S.C. 98, 100-01, 441 S.E.2d 822, 823 (1994) (holding that the workersâ€™ compensation act does not preclude a suit in circuit court brought by a medical provider against a compensation insurance carrier for the balance of unpaid medical bills relating to an employeeâ€™s treatment), and Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield v. South Carolina Indus. Commâ€™n, 274 S.C. 204, 262 S.E.2d 35 (1980) (holding that an employeeâ€™s private insurance carrier lacks standing to intervene in proceedings before the Commission).Â  Accordingly, we leave those questions for another day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26217","title":"Hardee v.

We reverse.Â  \r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nAppellants were badly injured in an accident which occurred in January of 1998.Â  Appellants were traveling through the intersection of Highways 701 and 319 in Conway when Patientâ€™s automobile struck Appellantsâ€™ automobile.Â  The accident occurred minutes after Respondent administered dialysis treatment to Patient. \r\nPatient is a Type 1 Insulin dependent diabetic whose diabetic condition is deemed â€œbrittle.â€Â  Patient took hemodialysis treatment three times a week and each treatment lasted almost four hours.Â  The dialysis treatment required that Patientâ€™s blood be taken out of his system, run into a dialysis machine to be cleaned, and then returned to Patientâ€™s body.\r\nAfter the completion of the dialysis treatment, Patient was released to go home.Â  During the drive home, Patient lost control of his vehicle, and ultimately collided with Appellants.Â  The accident resulted in Patientâ€™s death and devastating injuries to Appellants.\r\nFollowing the accident, Appellants filed this suit against Respondent for negligence related to the treatment of Patient in the administration of dialysis treatment.Â  Specifically, Appellants alleged that Respondent did not warn Patient of the ill effects that could result from his dialysis treatment, that Patient was experiencing insulin shock or suffering from low blood sugar at the time he left Respondentâ€™s facilities, and that Respondent did not perform the normal post-treatment tests or monitoring prior to releasing Patient.Â  Respondent filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court initially denied.Â  Respondent requested that the trial court alter or amend its decision, however, and after further consideration, the trial court granted Respondentâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nAt this point, Respondent forwarded a proposed order to Appellantsâ€™ counsel for comment.Â  Appellantsâ€™ counsel advised Respondent of a number of problems with the proposed order, however, prior to Appellantsâ€™ counsel having the opportunity to present these comments to the trial court, the court signed the order.Â  Appellants made a motion to alter or amend the order to correctly reflect the facts in the case.Â  The trial court denied Appellantsâ€™ motion, and this appeal followed.\r\nThis case was certified to this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and the following issues are before the Court for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the trial court err in determining that a medical provider does not owe a duty to a third party (non-patient), even if the medical provider negligently fails to warn a patient of the risks related to driving immediately following a medical procedure and the failure to warn the patient results in harm to the third party?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Should the trial courtâ€™s order be vacated because opposing counsel did not have the opportunity to review the proposed order pursuant to Rule 5,\r\n        SCRCP?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen reviewing the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina, Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 536 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).Â  A grant of summary judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  Because the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment focused only upon whether Respondent owed Appellants any duty of care, we limit our analysis accordingly.[1]\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Duty to third parties\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred in determining that, as a matter of law, a medical provider never owes a duty to a third party non-patient as a result of actions or omissions the provider takes in regard to a patientâ€™s treatment.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough this Court has never addressed this issue directly, we have decided similar cases.Â  Generally, an action against a doctor can only be maintained by the patient.Â  Bishop v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 84, 502 S.E.2d 78, 91 (1998).Â  However, this Court recognized in Bishop that a physician-patient relationship is not a requirement in every legal action against a medical provider.Â  Id. at 84, 502 S.E.2d at 92.Â  In that case, the Court stated that a physicianâ€™s malpractice in treating a patient may form the basis of a negligence action against the physician by a third party in limited circumstances.Â  Id.Â  This Court has never defined what constitutes the limited circumstances in which a third party can maintain suit against a medical provider as outlined in Bishop.\r\nAt the outset, it is important to characterize the precise nature of the cause of action to which this statement in Bishop alluded.Â  As we noted in Bishop, a medical malpractice action is instituted by a patient and is predicated upon a physicianâ€™s deviation from accepted standards of professional care in treating that patient.Â  Not every cause of action asserted against a medical provider, however, is an action for medical malpractice.Â  Thus, our statement in Bishop affirms the validity of the general rule prescribing the class of permissible plaintiffs in medical malpractice actions, but also recognizes that causes of action may accrue in other contexts by virtue of a medical providerâ€™s actions or omissions.\r\nIn this case, Appellants argue Respondent knew that the medical procedure it performed on Patient could have substantial detrimental effects on Patientâ€™s ability to operate a motor vehicle.Â  Thus, Appellants argue that if Respondent did not warn Patient of the risks of operating a motor vehicle, Respondent breached a duty a medical provider owes to those persons in the general field of danger (that is, the motoring public) which should reasonably have been forseen by Respondent when it administered the treatment.Â  \r\nWe believe South Carolina tort law ought to recognize such a duty.[2]Â  Generally, a medical provider has a duty to warn of the dangers associated with medical treatment.Â  Thus, a medical provider who provides treatment which it knows may have detrimental effects on a patientâ€™s capacities and abilities owes a duty to prevent harm to patients and to reasonably foreseeable third parties by warning the patient of the attendant risks and effects before administering the treatment.Â  Therefore, if Respondent knew that Patient could experience ill effects following dialysis treatment, Respondent owed Appellants a duty to warn Patient of the risks of driving.[3]Â  \r\nWe note that this is a very narrow holding that carves out an exception to the general rule that medical providers do not owe a duty to third party non-patients. Importantly, this duty owed to third parties is identical to the duty owed to the patient, i.e., a medical provider must warn a patient of the attendant risks and effects of any treatment. Â Thus, our holding does not hamper the doctor-patient relationship.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to alter or amend\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in denying their motion to alter or amend the judgment because the proposed order submitted by Respondent did not contain facts and legal issues that were raised before the trial court.Â  As a result, Appellants argue the trial courtâ€™s order should be vacated.Â  \r\nAlthough we decline to address this argument pursuant to Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing that an appellate court need not address additional issues if the resolution of another issue is dispositive), we note that Appellants properly made a motion to alter the trial courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment, which the trial court denied, and that Appellants appropriately appealed.Â  As a result, all relevant facts were before this Court for review.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above cited authority, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment and hold that the trial court erred in determining that a medical provider never owes a duty to a third party non-patient as a result of actions or omissions the provider takes in regard to a patientâ€™s treatment.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Specifically, the order granting summary judgment in this case focuses solely on the question of whether a medical provider owes a duty of care to a third party non-patient as a result of actions or omissions the provider takes in regard to a patientâ€™s treatment.Â  Thus, our review of this particular decision does not call upon us to perform a duty typically associated with a review of a summary judgment decision - determining the existence of any triable issues of fact. \r\n[2] â€œâ€˜[D]utyâ€™ is not sacrosanct in itself, but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.â€Â  William L. Prosser, Handbook of The Law of Torts Â§ 53, 325-326 (4th ed. 1971).\r\n[3] We note, however, that we do not make the determination that Respondent owed Appellants this duty of care.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment holding that under no factual circumstances could a duty exist.Â  We hold that, under some circumstances, a duty can exist.Â  Determining the existence of a duty in a particular case, however, is another question.Â  Our current responsibility is limited to construing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to Appellants and reviewing the trial courtâ€™s decision made as a matter of law.Â  Strother v.

Garner, Petitioner,\r\nv.\r\nState of South Carolina, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPetitioner filed an application for post-conviction relief (PCR) alleging trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the sufficiency of the indictments, in failing to file a direct appeal, and in failing to object to the sentence enhancement at the time of sentencing.Â  The State moved to dismiss the application as barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Petitionerâ€™s PCR counsel argued the statute of limitations should not apply to the application if petitioner was granted the right to a direct appeal.\r\nFollowing a hearing, the PCR judge found petitioner did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to direct appeal and was entitled to a belated review of his direct appeal issues pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â  The PCR judge also granted petitionerâ€™s motion to dismiss the application without prejudice and found the statute of limitations did not apply to petitionerâ€™s application since the PCR judge found petitioner was entitled to a belated appeal.\r\nThe State filed a motion to alter or amend the order.Â  The PCR judge granted the motion â€œto the extent that the findings and conclusion [were] amended to determine that the statute of limitations does not apply to [petitionerâ€™s] allegation that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to an appeal of his guilty plea [sic].â€Â  The order was further amended to reflect the Stateâ€™s objection to petitionerâ€™s motion to dismiss the remaining allegations without prejudice and to preserve the Stateâ€™s right to raise any and all defenses, such as the statute of limitations and laches, to any and all allegations raised in any future PCR actions.Â  Petitioner has filed a notice of appeal.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-80 (2003) states that a PCR court â€œshall make specific findings of fact, and state expressly its conclusions of law relating to each issue presented.Â  This order is the final order.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  All grounds for relief available to an applicant must be raised in his original, supplemental or amended application.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-90 (2003).Â  â€œAny ground finally adjudicated or not so raised, or knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived in the proceeding that resulted in the conviction or sentence or an any other proceeding the applicant has taken to secure relief, may not be the basis for a subsequent application, unless the court finds a ground for relief asserted which for sufficient reason was not asserted or was inadequately raised in the original, supplemental or amended application.â€Â  Id.Â  A final judgment entered under the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act may be reviewed by writ of certiorari.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-100 (2003); Rule 227(a),\r\nSCACR.\r\nAn order in a PCR matter which does not include specific findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to each issue presented, but instead dismisses some of the issues without prejudice to them being raised in a future PCR proceeding, does not constitute a final order or judgment under the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act and therefore is not reviewable by writ of certiorari.Â  Similar to the situation in Pruitt v. State, 310 S.C. 254, 423 S.E.2d 127 (1992), failure to finally resolve each of the issues presented in the PCR application when it is initially considered ultimately increases the work load of all involved when a new hearing is required to secure the rulings which should have been made initially.[1]Â  \r\nAccordingly, we dismiss petitionerâ€™s notice of appeal without prejudice to his right to file another notice of appeal upon the issuance of a final order on his PCR application.Â  We remand this case to the PCR judge to conduct a hearing, if necessary, and issue a final order which rules on all of the issues raised in petitionerâ€™s PCR application as well as the Stateâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  The final order shall be issued within sixty days of the date of this order.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.Â  \r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.
