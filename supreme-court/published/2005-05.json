Mahaffee, of Grimball &amp; Cabaniss, L.L.C., of Charleston, for Defendant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Pursuant to Rule 228, SCACR, we accepted the following questions on certification from the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Is an automobile insurer which provides only non-liability&nbsp; &ldquo;collision and other named perils&rdquo; coverage an &ldquo;automobile insurance carrier&rdquo; under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 38-77-160 (2002), and thus required to offer underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    If such an insurer is required to make an offer of UIM coverage, and no such offer was made, does the UIM coverage imposed by South Carolina law extend to the limits of a separate (though simultaneously obtained) liability policy?\r\n  \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKROUND\r\nThe plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident.Â  Plaintiff was a passenger in a car being driven by the defendant.Â  Defendant was at fault in causing the accident.Â  Plaintiff has suffered damages which exceed the extent of all coverages which could be applicable.\r\nAt the time of the accident, Plaintiff was residing with his father, who owned and operated a tractor-trailer that was not involved in the accident.Â  Plaintiffâ€™s father obtained non-trucking insurance on the tractor-trailer from two separate companies, but through a single agent.Â  The insurance consisted of:Â  (1) liability coverage up to $500,000 from Connecticut Indemnity Co. and (2) collision coverage up to $18,000 from Occidental Fire &amp; Casualty Company.Â  Neither Connecticut nor Occidental offered UIM coverage to Plaintiffâ€™s father.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn answering a certified question raising a novel question of law, the Court is free to decide the question based on its assessment of which answer and reasoning would best comport with the law and public policies of this state and the Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and right.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2004)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same); Antley v. New York Life Ins. Co., 139 S.C. 23, 30, 137 S.E. 199, 201 (1927) (â€œIn [a] state of conflict between the decisions, it is up to the court to â€˜choose ye this day whom ye will serveâ€™; and, in the duty of this decision, the court has the right to determine which doctrine best appeals to its sense of law, justice, and right.â€).\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  Plaintiff argues an automobile insurer which provides only collision insurance, is an â€œautomobile insurance carrierâ€ under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160, and is thus required to offer UIM coverage.Â Â  Section 38-77-160 provides, in relevant part: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Automobile insurance carriers shall offer, at the option of the  insured, uninsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insuredâ€™s liability coverage in addition to the mandatory coverage prescribed in Section 38-77-150.Â  Such carriers shall also offer, at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage in the event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault insured or underinsured motorist or in excess of any damages cap or limitation imposed by statute.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe question we must decide is whether an insurer which provides only non-liability â€œcollision and other named perilsâ€ coverage constitutes an â€œautomobile insurance carrierâ€ under Section 38-77-160.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  In ascertaining the intent of the Legislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider the language of the statute as a whole.Â  Mid-State Automotive Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  When a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its literal meaning.Â  Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994).Â  However plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.Â  Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  If possible, the court will construe the statute so as to escape the absurdity and carry the intention into effect. Id.\r\nThe term â€œautomobile insurance carrierâ€ is not defined in the pertinent South Carolina statutes.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(1) (2002) defines â€œautomobile insuranceâ€ as follows:\r\n\r\n  â€œAutomobile insuranceâ€ means automobile bodily injury and  property damage liability insurance, including medical payments, and uninsured motorist coverage, and automobile physicalÂ  damage, collision, fire, theft, combined additional coverage, and similar automobile physical damage insurance and economic loss benefits as provided by this chapter written or offered by automobile insurers.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nPlaintiff urges us to conclude that because Section 38-77-30(1) specifically includes â€œcollisionâ€ and other perils insurance, an automobile insurer providing only non-liability â€œcollision and other named perilsâ€ coverage is an â€œautomobile insurance carrierâ€ under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 and is required to offer UIM coverage.Â  \r\nPlaintiff also cites Davis v. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 298 S.C. 135, 378 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  The issue in Davis was whether the State Insurance Reserve Fund must offer UIM coverage to those state agencies and political subdivisions to which it provides motor vehicle liability coverage.Â  The Court of Appeals considered whether the State Insurance Reserve Fund is an â€œautomobile insurance carrierâ€ under Section 38-77-160 and stated the following:\r\nThe term â€œautomobile insurance carrierâ€ is not defined by statute.Â  However, read in the context of other statutes in pari materia, it is clearly synonymous with the terms â€œinsurerâ€ and â€œautomobile insurer.â€ . . . Section 38-77-30(2) . . . defines â€œautomobile insurerâ€ to mean â€œan insurer licensed to do business in South Carolina and authorized to issue automobile insurance policies.â€Â  Section 38-1-20(25) . . . defines â€œinsurerâ€ to include\r\n\r\n   any corporation, fraternal organization, . . . other association, partnership, society, order, individual, orÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  aggregation of individuals engaging or proposing orÂ Â Â Â Â Â  attempting to engage as principals in any kind of insurance or surety business . . . .\r\n\r\nDavis, 298 S.C. at 137-138, 378 S.E.2d at 606-607.\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded the State Insurance Reserve Fund did not fall under either definition and thus was not required to offer UIM coverage.[1] Plaintiff argues, that unlike the State Insurance Reserve Fund, Occidental is an automobile insurance carrier because Occidental admits it is an automobile insurer.Â  Therefore, Occidental was required to offer UIM coverage.Â  We agree Occidental is an automobile insurance carrier.Â  However, we conclude an automobile insurer providing only collision insurance to its insured should not be required to make a meaningful offer of UIM.Â  \r\nFirst, to accept Plaintiffâ€™s argument requiring an insurer providing only collision insurance to make a meaningful offer of UIM would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature.Â  Section 38-77-160 requires an offer of optional UIM coverage â€œup to the limits of the liability coverage.â€Â  If an automobile insurer providing only collision insurance to its insured falls within the UIM requirements of Section 38-77-160, then arguably under the statute, it must provide liability coverage up to the amount provided by another insurer despite the fact the collision insurer never contracted to provide liability insurance.Â  If interpreted broadly, it would also require an insurer providing only collision insurance to the insured to make a meaningful offer of UIM to an insured who previously bought liability insurance from another carrier.Â  This would be a far-reaching conclusion, which would require a subsequent insurer providing only collision insurance to determine what, if any, liability insurance the insured may have with another carrier.Â  We do not believe the Legislature intended an insurer providing only collision coverage be subject to potential liability in amounts under a contract to which it was not a party.\r\nSecond, Davis provides limited guidance in this case.Â  The only issue before the Court of Appeals was whether the State Insurance Reserve Fund, a unique entity, was an â€œautomobile insurance carrier.â€Â  It is undisputed in this case that Occidental is an automobile insurance carrier. The conclusion in Davis is inapposite under the facts of this case.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude the â€œmeaningful offerâ€ provision under Â§ 38-77-160 is triggered only when an insurer offers liability insurance and does not require an insurer providing only collision coverage to make an offer of UIM.Â  Accordingly, we answer the first certified question: no.Â  Our disposition of this issue makes it unnecessary to address the second certified question.Â  \r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\nÂ [1] The Court of Appeals concluded the State Insurance Reserve Fund is a special fund established and administered by the State Budget and Control Board under direct authority from the General Assembly and is thus not a corporation, fraternal organization, partnership, etc.Â  Davis, 298 S.C. at 138, 378 S.E.2d at 606.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Miles L.

Freeman, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to the issuance of a letter of caution, admonition, or a public reprimand.Â  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was hired as an associate to manage the Greenville office of the Forquer Law Firm.Â  Respondent worked under the supervision of Robert Forquer who is not licensed in South Carolina and who works in the firmâ€™s Charlotte, North Carolina, office.Â  When respondent learned it was the firmâ€™s practice to inflate government recording fees on HUD-1settlement statements, he questioned Mr. Forquer about the practice.Â  Mr. Forquer assured respondent that the practice was ethical and legal.Â  \r\nRespondent has been informed by ODC that the Forquer Law Firm failed to maintain sufficient records of the recording fee charges and failed to identify and track client funds relating thereto in its accounts.Â  No record of the actual amounts paid for recording fees were kept in the closing files and no accounting of the overcharges was made to clients.Â  The funds obtained in excess of the actual recording fees were used for a variety of purposes including office expenses, correction of errors in closings, payroll or other payments to staff, and payments in various amounts to Mr. Forquer and a former partner, Mr. Green.Â  \r\nWhile respondent had signatory authority on the firmâ€™s bank accounts, he had no access to or responsibility for its financial records.Â  Respondent knew that the management and recordkeeping of the firmâ€™s accounts was handled by Mr. Forquer in the firmâ€™s Charlotte office.Â  Respondent was unaware that the firm was not complying with the requirements of Rule 417, SCACR, or that Mr. Forquer was using the excess recording fees for firm and personal expenses.Â  Respondent did not profit in any way from the overcharges.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that it was his responsibility 1) to inform his clients they were being charged more than the actual cost of the recording fees and 2) to ensure the accuracy of information contained in the HUD-1 forms in the closings he supervised.Â  Respondent further acknowledges his ethical duty to ensure the firmâ€™s compliance with his obligation of safekeeping of funds and financial recordkeeping, particularly when those responsibilities were handled by non-lawyers or lawyers not licensed in South Carolina.Â  Respondent acknowledges that, as office manager and supervisor of associates, he had additional responsibilities to ensure his staffâ€™s compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  \r\nRespondent has fully cooperated with ODCâ€™s investigation. \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.15 (addressing lawyerâ€™s responsibility for safekeeping client funds); Rule 5.1 (lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyerâ€™s violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if, with knowledge of the specific conduct, the lawyer ratifies the conduct involved); Rule 5.2 (lawyer is bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct notwithstanding lawyer acts at the direction of another person); and Rule 8.3 (lawyer having knowledge that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as that lawyerâ€™s honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the appropriate professional authority).Â  In addition, respondent admits he failed to comply with Rule 417, SCACR (addressing financial recordkeeping).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25979","title":"In the Matter of Barry W .

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex Davis, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nBarry W. Bellino, of Pensacola, Florida, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of an indefinite suspension as provided by Rule 7(b)(2) , RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state. \r\nThe facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn several occasions over the course of several years, respondent made or attempted to make social contacts with females who were clients or prospective clients.Â  Under the circumstances and/or conditions,[1] the social contacts were inappropriate for attorneys and clients and constituted misconduct.Â  Respondent does not admit the contacts were either illegal or immoral, but he does agree the social contacts constituted misconduct in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and that the social contacts constitute grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1) and (5), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â Â Â  \r\nThis Court has previously sanctioned respondent for misconduct involving female clients.Â  In In the Matter of Bellino, 308 S.C. 130, 417 S.E.2d 535 (1992), respondent admitted that on twoÂ  occasions he used unlawful or violent force against female clients with the specific intent to gratify his lust or sexual desires.Â  Respondent was convicted of criminal charges, sentenced to a period of confinement, forfeited pay, and was dismissed from the Marine Corps.Â  The Court imposed a six month suspension, in addition to the thirty-one month interim suspension, and required respondent to take and pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination before applying for readmission.Â  As specified in the order placing him on his current interim suspension, respondentâ€™s interim suspension stems from similar behavior with female clients.Â  In the Matter of Bellino, 355 S.C. 82, 584 S.E.2d 119 (2003).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent agrees his conduct violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.7 (addressing conflicts of interest); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(c) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); and 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â Â In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  We deny respondentâ€™s request to make the indefinite suspension retroactive to July 22, 2003, the date he was placed on interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n INDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] No description of the social contacts or attempted social contacts is provided in the Agreement.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25980","title":"Gadson v.

Emory Smith, Jr., all of Columbia, and Lisa Marie Hatley, of Conway, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This is an action seeking return of property pursuant to the innocent owner provision of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-586 (2002).Â  The trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for dismissal and summary judgment.Â  This Court certified the case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nJames Gadson owned a lot and building in the City of Georgetown.Â  He leased the building to Harriet Ann Singleton Evans.Â  Evans operated the Winyah Grill, a bar and lounge, on the premises.[1]Â  Ronald Lee McCants, an employee of Evans was arrested for distribution of crack cocaine inside Gadsonâ€™s building.[2]\r\nOn May 4, 1993, Judge Shuler signed a seizure warrant authorizing the solicitor, on behalf of the Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s Office and Georgetown City Police Department, to seize the property due to violations of the drug code.Â  Judge Shuler also signed a notice of seizure on May 4, 1993.Â  \r\nOn May 13, 1993, the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) inspected the building and found numerous structural and electrical defects and also determined the fire exits were wholly inadequate.Â  On May 17, 1993, the Resident Fire Marshal and Mayor of Georgetown signed a â€œnotice of unsafe building.â€ The notice provided that if remedial work was not completed by June 30, 1993, to correct the building, structural, and fire code deficiencies, the City of Georgetown would demolish the property.\r\nAlso on May 17, 1993, the special prosecutor filed a lis pendens giving notice of the forfeiture action based on the controlled substances violations.Â  City Council revoked Evansâ€™ business license on May 24, 1993, due to the controlled substances sales, as well as, building and fire code violations.Â  \r\nIn July 1993, the City of Georgetown demolished the building after Gadson failed to take corrective actions to resolve the building defects.Â  On November 2, 1993, the City filed a demolition lien on the property in the amount of $16,292.50.Â  \r\nBy motion dated April 28, 1994, Gadson requested the circuit court â€œrestoreâ€ the property to him pursuant to the innocent owner provision of the forfeiture statute.Â  See 44-53-586(b)(1) (2002).Â  On May 20, 1994, Judge Sydney Floyd denied Gadson relief on his motions.\r\nOn December 7, 1994, Gadson filed a suit in federal court.Â  On May 3, 1996, Judge Norton signed an order effecting the partiesâ€™ agreement to voluntarily dismiss the federal suit.Â  The parties agreed Gadson could re-file the federal action prior to the close of the 1996 calendar year.Â  Gadson failed to re-file the federal lawsuit by December 31, 1996.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn late 1996, Gadson died.Â  On June 20, 1997, the probate court appointed the personal representatives of Gadsonâ€™s estate.Â  On January 28, 1998, Gadsonâ€™s estate filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment dissolving the seizure warrant and lien.Â  On May 5, 1999, the circuit court dismissed the complaint because there was a prior pending action (this action) which provided Gadsonâ€™s estate the exclusive remedy.Â  The order allowed Gadsonâ€™s estate to proceed with the April 1994 state court lawsuit.Â  \r\nOn October 21, 2003, Appellants filed a motion for summary judgment requesting the seizure warrant and lis pendens placed on the property be dissolved and vacated.Â  Appellants also allege they are entitled to the return of property still in possession of the Respondents, and recovery of the value of property demolished.Â  The circuit court granted the Respondentsâ€™ motion for dismissal and summary judgment, concluding (1) Appellants failed to state a claim against the solicitor; (2) there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding Appellantsâ€™ entitlement to damages under the forfeiture statute; and (3) Appellants have failed to state a claim for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  CafÃ© Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 406 S.E.2d 162 (1991).Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Middleborough Horizontal Property Regime Council of Co-Owners v. Montedison, 320 S.C. 470, 465 S.E.2d 765 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Further, summary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary facts, if there is a dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn therefrom.Â  MacFarlane v. Manly, 274 S.C. 392, 264 S.E.2d 838 (1980).Â  An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the Georgetown City Police Department and the Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s Office, acting through the Solicitor for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit (hereinafter referred to as the â€œseizing agencyâ€), had a duty to maintain the seized property after Judge Shuler signed the seizure warrant on May 4, 1993, authorizing the solicitor to seize the property due to controlled substances violations.Â  Therefore, according to Appellants, the seizing agency violated its duty to take reasonable steps to maintain the property when the City of Georgetown demolished the property. Furthermore, Appellants contend they could not be expected to defend against the demolition of the property because the seizing agency exercised control over the property once the seizure warrant was issued.\r\nInitially, we agree with Appellants that a seizing agency has a duty to take reasonable steps to maintain property once a warrant is issued for seizure of the property.Â  Section 44-53-520(i) (2002) provides:\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement agencies seizing propertyÂ  [that is subject toÂ  forfeiture under this section] shall take reasonable steps to maintain the property.Â  Equipment and conveyances seized must be removed to an appropriate place for storage.Â  Any monies seized must be deposited in an interest bearing account pending final disposition by the court unless the seizing agency determines the monies to be of an evidential nature and provides for security in another manner. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe plain language of Section 44-53-520(i) unequivocally provides that agencies seizing property have an obligation to take reasonable steps to maintain the property.Â  The circuit court held the duty to take reasonable steps to maintain the property did not arise in this case because a forfeiture action was never initiated under Section 44-53-530(a) (2002).Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. 44-53-530(a) provides that forfeiture of the property is â€œaccomplished by petition of the Attorney General or his designee or the circuit solicitor or his designee to the court of common pleas for the jurisdiction where the items were seized.â€Â  However, a seizing agency may seize property until lawful disposition of the property is ordered and the property is declared forfeited by petition.Â  Section 44-53-520(b) provides, in part, that property subject to forfeiture may be seized by the department having authority upon warrant issued by any court having jurisdiction over the property.Â  Such warrant was issued in this case.Â  A forfeiture action, however, was never initiated under Section 44-53-530(a).\r\nThe seizing agencyâ€™s duty to take reasonable steps to maintain the property arises upon seizure pursuant to Section 44-53-520(b) and before forfeiture of the property is formally accomplished by petition pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-530(a).\r\nAlthough, the seizing agency has a duty to take reasonable steps to maintain the property upon issuance of a seizure warrant, the seizing agency in this case did not violate its duty under the facts of this case.Â  We decline to impose a duty on a seizing agency to commence legal action in an effort to protect property subject to a seizure warrant against a wholly independent legal process initiated by the City of Georgetown.Â  The Georgetown City Police Department and the Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s Office, acting through the Solicitor for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, as the lawful seizing agency, did not violate the duty to take reasonable steps to maintain the property because the City of Georgetown acted under lawful process in condemning the property based on independent violations of existing building and fire code standards.Â  Forfeiture and condemnation proceedings are competing legal processes and, as such, the seizing agency acting pursuant to its forfeiture authority has no duty to defend against cityâ€™s process.Â  \r\nRecognizing that legal actions of forfeiture and condemnation are distinct, we conclude any defenses Appellants may have asserted were against the City of Georgetown for the condemnation of the building.Â  Therefore, the circuit court properly granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment because there is no genuine issue of material fact the seizing agency violated its duty to take reasonable steps to maintain the property.Â  Finally, our resolution of this issue is dispositive and we need not address Appellantsâ€™ remaining issues regarding whether the City of Georgetown was an indispensable party in this action, what remedies Appellants would be entitled to under the forfeiture statute, and Appellantsâ€™ request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Whiteside v.

Conway, of Cheraw, pro se.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, Respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, Respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a confidential admonition or public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b)(3) and (4), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 20, 2003, Defendant was arrested by Pageland police for failing to use a turn signal and stealing crops.Â  Respondent set Defendantâ€™s bond on these charges at $650.00.Â  On or about August 21, 2003, Jane Doe paid $650.00 in cash to Respondent as bond for Defendant.Â  Jane Doe reports she saw Respondent place the money in his pocket.Â  \r\nDefendant was released from jail after posting an amount equal to the fines for the charges.Â  Defendant intended that the forfeiture of his money conclude the matter.\r\nDefendantâ€™s charges came before another judge for trial on September 2, 2003. Â This judge had no paperwork concerning Jane Doeâ€™s payment of the $650.00.Â  Defendant was tried in his absence, a bench warrant was issued, and a Non-Resident Violator Compact (NRVC) notice was sent to Respondent on the traffic offense. \r\nAfter receiving the NRVC and learning that a local police officer with a bench warrant was looking for him, Defendant contacted the presiding judge who subsequently reported the matter to the Chief Magistrate.Â  The Chief Magistrate examined Respondentâ€™s books and found no record of Defendantâ€™s bond.Â  When questioned by the Chief Magistrate, Respondent acknowledged receiving the money but stated it was missing, that he could not find it, that he made a mistake, and that he would repay the money.Â  The agreement represents Respondent repaid the $650.00 with funds borrowed from his mother-in-law.Â  Respondent resigned from office on August 1, 2004.Â  \r\nDisciplinary Counsel examined Respondentâ€™s financial records for the months of August and September 2003 and found no record of a $650.00 deposit on or around the date Respondent received the money from Jane Doe.Â  Respondent does not dispute that he placed the money in his pocket.Â  Respondent informed Disciplinary Counsel that he sometimes did not complete all bond paperwork for evening bond hearings until the next day and, in accordance with this practice, surmises he may have taken the money home where it may have been commingled with personal funds on his dresser.Â  \r\nDuring Disciplinary Counselâ€™s audit of Respondentâ€™s magisterial account, one overage was discovered.Â  Respondent acknowledges depositing his personal money into his magisterial account due to his belief that there might be a shortage in the account.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that his failure to receipt and deposit bond money and his failure to maintain accurate financial records violates the Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order of November 9, 1999 governing money handling and recordkeeping by summary court judges.Â  In addition, Respondent admits his practices violated Canons 1, 1(A), 2, 2(A), 3, 3(A), and 3(C) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Rules 7(a)(1) and (7) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, Respondent has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1(A) (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity of the judiciary will be preserved);\r\nCanon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3A (judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all the judgeâ€™s other activities); and Canon 3C (judge shall maintain professional competence in judicial administration).Â  In addition, Respondent has also violated Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to willfully violate a valid court order) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand.[1]Â  Hereafter, Respondent shall neither seek nor accept any judicial office in this state, whether by appointment or election, without permission of the Court, and he shall neither seek nor accept permission of the Court without prior notice to Disciplinary Counsel.

Robbins, of Summerville, for\r\nRespondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:  The appellant Brennan Shay Jackson (Jackson) was convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to ten years.Â  He contends the trial court erred in admitting a photograph of him at a Halloween party when he was dressed as a prisoner and in refusing to allow him to introduce polygraph results in rebuttal after an insurance adjuster had testified that he had asked Jackson whether he would be willing to take a polygraph.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTSÂ  \r\nJackson is the nephew of Barbara and Bobby Ayer and the owner of a pawnshop.Â  Jackson also cleaned and did odd jobs for the Ayers three days/week. Â Â Â  The State alleged that sometime between June 1 and December 16, 2000, Jackson stole approximately $190,000-200,000 in old collectible coins and bills from the Ayerâ€™s two home safes.Â  There was no sign of forced entry.[1]Â  \r\nJackson testified Barbara paid him between $500-1,000 per week. Further, he testified Barbara gave him gold and silver coins and old money on many occasions. Barbara, however, testified she paid him only $100 per week and she never paid him with silver dollars or other old money.Â  Over the years, Barbara had given Jackson large sums of money to help him purchase a car, a truck, and a cruise for Jacksonâ€™s father, and open the pawnshop. [2] Â  \r\nUpon discovering that the coins and money were missing, Bobby called his insurance agent.Â  Insurance adjuster Bill Spell investigated the theft.Â  During his investigation, Spell interviewed Jackson and Stephen Phillips who had worked for the Ayers during the fall of 2000.Â  At trial, Jackson admitted he sold some old paper money and coins worth several hundred dollars to John â€œSmokeyâ€ Dukes, Phillipsâ€™ cousin, at a Halloween party.Â  In fact, Jackson admitted some of the money that was sold to Smokey Dukes came from the Ayerâ€™s house.Â  However, he testified his aunt had given him the money.Â  Jackson also admitted he sold approximately $8,000 worth of Krugerrands to Carolina Gold and Silver and Baxleyâ€™s Pawnshop. At trial, Phillips testified about Jacksonâ€™s various cash expenditures between June and December 2000. He specifically testified Jackson spent $800 to hire a band to play at the farmerâ€™s market for a football game; bought some guns; and paid $2,000 in labor costs for Phillips to build him a dog kennel. He also testified Jackson bought a $13,000 boat in March 2000.Â  Additionally, there was testimony Jackson paid $4,000 cash for a cruise in the fall of 2000.Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\n1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in admitting photographs\r\nof Jackson in a prisonerâ€™s costume at a Halloween\r\nparty? \r\n2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in denying Jacksonâ€™s\r\nrequest to introduce evidence that he had passed a polygraph test? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n1)Â  Photograph\r\n\r\nDuring a pre-trial hearing, Jackson objected to the Stateâ€™s introduction of several photographs taken of appellant at a Halloween party held in 2000.[3]Â  Appellant was dressed as a prisoner.Â  The State later sought to introduce only one of the photographs to show appellant was at the party along with twoÂ  Stateâ€™s witnesses who would testify that Jackson had sold them things stolen from the victims.Â  Jackson contended the photograph was prejudicial because he was dressed in a prison uniform.Â  He argued the photograph was more prejudicial than probative.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Jackson contends the photograph gave the impression that he had a light-hearted attitude toward lawlessness and found criminal behavior amusing.Â  Jackson contends the photograph was irrelevant to any issue.Â  Further, he argues he never contested he was at the Halloween party and offered to stipulate he was there. \r\nThe State, however, has the right to prove every element of the crime charged and is not obligated to rely upon a defendant's stipulation. State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 122, 525 S.E.2d 519, 523 (2000).Â  The relevancy, materiality, and admissibility of photographs are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 350 S.E.2d 180 (1986).Â Â  â€œ[T]here is no abuse of discretion if the offered photograph serves to corroborate testimony.â€Â  Johnson, 338 S.C. at 122, 525 S.E.2d at 523.Â Â Â  However, photographs calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are irrelevant or not necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions. State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 480 S.E.2d 64 (1997).Â  To constitute unfair prejudice, the photographs must create â€œan undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.&quot;Â  State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991).Â  Even if evidence was irrelevant and thus wrongly admitted by the trial judge, its admission may constitute harmless error if the irrelevant evidence did not affect the outcome of the trial. State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991).\r\nThe State contends it introduced the photograph to show Jackson was at the party and had sold stolen items.Â  While the photograph does not show any of the stolen items, Jackson testified that in the photograph he was selling some of the alleged stolen goods to Smokey Dukes.Â  Thus, the photograph was clearly relevant.\r\nFurther, the photo would not cause the jury to reach a decision on an improper basis.Â  The photo was taken prior to Jackson being identified as a potential suspect and, in fact, prior to the discovery of the crime.Â Â  We find any prejudice from Jackson having on a prisonerâ€™s costume is outweighed by the photographâ€™s probative value.Â  Accordingly, we do not think that the admission of this particular photograph is reversible error.Â  \r\n\r\n2) Polygraph test results\r\n\r\nJackson contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to introduce evidence that he had passed a polygraph test given by a private polygrapher.Â Â  Jackson contends the State opened the door and that he should have been allowed to reply.Â Â  During the trial, the State presented a recording of a conversation that the insurance investigator Spell had taped with Jackson.[4]Â Â  During this conversation, Spell asked Jackson whether he would be willing to take a polygraph. [5] Â Â  Jackson answered he would be willing to take a polygraph.Â  Jackson did not make any contemporaneous objection to the reference to a polygraph test.Â  In fact, when the tape of the conversation was initially played, the trial court specifically asked Jackson if he had any objection to the tape being played and he stated no.Â Â  Immediately after the tape was played, the State moved into evidence and Jackson again stated he had â€œ[n]o objection at all.â€Â  \r\nJackson then informed the trial court that he had a matter he wanted to take up with the court.Â  Jackson stated that the State had opened the door for the admission of polygraph results.[6]Â  The Solicitor responded that he did not believe the door had been opened and further he pointed out that the Sheriff had offered Jackson a polygraph to be administered by State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) but Jackson never took up his offer.Â Â  The trial court told Jackson he would have to hold a Council[7] hearing to determine if the polygraph results were admissible.\r\nJackson told the trial court he had not prepared for a Council hearing and after some discussion stated he would think about it overnight.Â  The Solicitor reiterated that if Jackson presented any evidence ofÂ  polygraph test results, the State â€œintend[ed]Â  to call the Sheriff to say he was prepared to take [Jackson] to S.L.E.D. and [Jackson] did not take him up on it.â€Â  The next morning trial counsel stated he had thought about it and decided that he would simply ask the witness whether Jackson had agreed to take a polygraph and whether one was administered and â€œleave it at that.â€ Clearly, Jackson abandoned his motion to admit the polygraph test results. [8] Â  \r\nOn appeal, Jackson contends that â€œwhile any potential Council issue was waived, the issue of rebuttal was clearly raised and ruled upon by the trial court.â€Â Â  Jackson contends the State â€œopened the door . . . for evidence that [Jackson] took [a polygraph test] and passed itâ€ and he should have been allowed to introduce polygraph evidence in rebuttal.Â  \r\nWhen a party introduces evidence about a particular matter, the other party is entitled to explain it or rebut it, even if the latter evidence would have been incompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially. See State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 582 S.E.2d 426 (2003).Â  However, here, Jackson waived any argument he had when he acquiesced the next morning and stated he would ask Spell if he had administered a polygraph and â€œleave it at that.â€Â Â  Jackson did not note any objection.Â  Jackson made a decision to not introduce any evidence of the polygraph test results in rebuttal.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved.\r\nIn any event, Jackson was not prejudiced. State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000) (holding error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).Â  The testimony before the jury was that Jackson stated he would be willing to take a polygraph and Spell testified he never offered him one.Â Â  This would not leave the jury with the impression that Jackson had taken and failed a polygraph.Â  Accordingly, based on the foregoing, Jacksonâ€™s conviction and sentence areÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Marc H. Westbrook, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Two rings initially thought to also have been stolen were later discovered in the Ayerâ€™s home. \r\n[2] Barbara had made a deathbed promise to her mother (Jacksonâ€™s grandmother) to take care of Jackson and by all accounts had been extremely generous to Jackson over the years. \r\n[3]When the State introduced the photograph during trial, Jackson asked the trial court to note his pre-trial objection to its admission.Â  The State argues that Jackson failed to state his objection in terms of Rule 403, SCRE, and therefore is barred from arguing this rule on appeal.Â  While Jackson did not argue specifically Rule 403, he clearly argued that the prejudicial value of the photo outweighed any probative value.Â  Accordingly, Jackson properly preserved this objection.\r\n[4]We note trial counsel was present at this meeting.Â  \r\n[5]The pertinent part of the conversation is as follows:\r\nSpell:Â  Would you be willing to take a polygraph?\r\nAppellant:Â  Yeah.Â  Thatâ€™d be fine.\r\nSpell: Okay. You donâ€™tÂ  have any problem doing that?\r\nAppellant:Â  Unhuh.Â  Thatâ€™s fine.\r\n[6]Apparently, prior to trial Jackson had taken a private polygraph and passed.Â  However, neither the results ofÂ  this polygraph nor the questions asked during the test were proffered for the record.\r\n[7]State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999)(holding the admissibility of polygraph tests must be analyzed under Rules 702 and 403, SCRE.). \r\n[8]Spell later testified that he asked Jackson if he would be willing to take a polygraph and his response was â€œsureâ€ but he never offered Jackson one. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25984","title":"Pittman v.

Cothran, Jr., of Spartanburg, and Michael L. Rudasill, of Lawrence &amp; Rudasill, P.A., of Spartanburg, for Appellants.\r\nAndrew F. Lindemann, of Davidson, Morrison &amp; Lindemann, P.A., of Columbia; and Edwin Brown Parkinson, Jr., of Devlin &amp; Parkinson, P.A., of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: This case is a medical malpractice case.Â  The jury returned a verdict for the doctor.Â  The trial court denied the appellantsâ€™ motion for a new trial on the ground the trial courtâ€™s erroneously failed to charge two requested jury instructions.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS&nbsp; \r\nIn June 1998, appellant Franklin Pittman underwent back surgery.Â  The respondent Dr. Keith Stevens was the anesthesiologist. The surgery required that Pittman, a morbidly obese diabetic, be placed in a prone position for approximately four hours. Because of a previous cervical surgery and Pittmanâ€™s other health conditions, he was more at risk for developing lesions or ulcers at pressure points.Â  To help relieve pressure points during the surgery, Dr. Stevens placed a gel pad under Pittmanâ€™s face.Â  \r\nÂ Following the surgery, however, Pittman developed a lesion on his forehead - similar to a blister.Â  Although the skin lesion eventually healed, he alleges he suffered nerve damage.Â  Pittman testified that he has constant headaches along with â€œlightning strikesâ€ or very sharp pains and his head is very sensitive. He brought this action against Dr. Stevens alleging negligence.Â  Pittmanâ€™s wife brought a loss of consortium claim. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in failing toÂ charge two requested jury instructions? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAt the jury charge conference, Pittman requested two jury instructions, referred to as requested charges Numbers 7 and 8:Â  \r\n\r\nRequest to Charge No. 7\r\nWhile evidence of ordinary practice or the uniform custom of persons in similar circumstances is to be weighed and considered with other circumstances in determining whether ordinary care has been exercised, conformity to custom is not in and of itself the exercise of due care as a matter of law.\r\nRequest to Charge No. 8\r\nIf there is a great degree of danger present, then there is a greater duty of care to prevent injury to other persons.Â  When there is a risk of substantial danger present, and the symptoms of the patient are considered with such a risk, then the physician has a duty to respond in proportion to the risk.Â  The greater the risk of the condition to the patient, the greater the duty of the physician to respond appropriately and to provide the appropriate treatment.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge stated he would cover these requested charges.Â  After the trial judge had charged the jury, the appellants informed the judge that the requested charge Numbers 7 and 8 had not been included.Â Â  After commenting on the lack of specific authority to support these requested charges, the trial judge ruled that the charge as a whole was fair.Â  After the jury returned a verdict for the doctor, the appellants moved for a new trial on the ground that the trial judge failed to charge the requested charges.Â  The trial judge denied the motion and stated that he thought his general charge adequately covered the requested charges. \r\nThe trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina. McCourt v. Abernathy,Â  318 S.C. 301, 305, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606Â  (1995).Â  When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, an appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 311, 536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999)).Â  A trial court's refusal to give a properly requested charge is reversible error only when the requesting party can demonstrate prejudice from the refusal.Â  Vogt v. Murraywood Swim &amp; Racquet Club,Â  357 S.C. 506, 512, 593 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nWe first note that the appellants cite no case law either from South Carolina or any other jurisdiction to support either of these requested charges.Â  The appellants cite to section 27-2 of Judge Ralph King Anderson Jr.â€™s South Carolina Request to Charge.Â Â  As noted by the trial judge, the requested charges are two paragraphs out of a charge that covers 4Â½ pages in Judge Andersonâ€™s book.Â  The entire charge is then followed by a list of authorities which purports to support the charge.Â  It is not apparent which authorities support the specific paragraphs which the appellants requested the trial court charge.Â  \r\nAs to Charge Number 7, the appellants do not cite to any South Carolina case law.Â Â  In fact, there is actually a South Carolina case directly contrary to requested charge Number 7.Â  In Doe v. Am. Red Cross Blood Serv., 297 S.C. 430, 435, 377 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1989), the Court answered several certified questions in a case involving the standards used by blood banks and the spread of HIV/AIDs through contaminated blood.Â Â  One of the issues was whether the blood banks were negligent in failing to screen for HIV even though at that time the customary practice was not to screen.Â  The Court held: \r\n\r\nin a professional negligence cause of action, the standard of care that the plaintiff must prove is that the professional failed to conform to the generally recognized and accepted practices in his profession. If the plaintiff is unable to demonstrate that the professional failed to conform to the generally recognized and accepted practices in his profession, then the professional cannot be found liable as a matter of law. \r\n\r\nId. at 435, 377 S.E.2d at 326 (emphasis added). The Court specifically deferred â€œto the collective wisdom of a profession, such as physicians, dentists, ophthalmologists, accountants and any other profession which furnishes skilled services for compensation.â€Â  Id. (emphasis added).[1]Â  Request Number 7 states â€œconformity to custom is not in and of itself the exercise of due care as a matter of law.â€Â  Request Number 7 is directly contrary to the Courtâ€™s holding in Doe.Â Â  Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in failing to charge this proposed jury instruction.\r\nAs for Request Number 8, Dr. Stevens contends the issue is not preserved because the appellants alleged error only as to charge number 7 in their Amended Notice of Appeal.Â  We disagree.Â  In their Amended Notice of Appeal, the appellants specifically state they are appealing the trial courtâ€™s denial of their â€œmotion for a new trial and the courtâ€™s order refusing the [appellantsâ€™] request to charge number 7.â€Â  The appellantsâ€™ motion for a new trial was made on the ground that the trial judge failed to charge both requested jury charges and the Statement of the Issue on appealÂ  encompasses both requests.Â  While the Amended Notice of Appeal does not specifically refer to charge Number 8, it complies with Rule 203(e), SCACR, and the example set out in the appendix[2] and clearly the appellantsâ€™ notice was adequate to inform Dr. Stevens that the appellants were appealing the trial courtâ€™s denial of the new trial motion.Â Â  See Henson v. Intâ€™l Paper Co.,Â  358 S.C. 133, 142, 594 S.E.2d 499, 503 (Ct. App. 2004)(holding the issue statement encompassed the argument).Â  \r\nAs to the merits, Request Number 8 is a general negligence law principle and there is no South Carolina case law supporting its application in a medical malpractice action.Â  Furthermore, we found only one case from another jurisdiction discussing this issue, Hinkle v. Cleveland Clinic Found., 2004 WL 2914993 (Ohio App. 8 Dist. filed Dec. 16, 2004).Â  In Hinkle, the court held the trial courtâ€™s failure to charge the â€œgreater dangerâ€ instruction was not error.[3]Â  The court also noted that it could â€œfind no case law to support the proposed jury instruction in a medical malpractice case.â€Â  Id. at 11.Â  \r\nThis type of instruction has been questioned in general negligence actions because the amount of care in relation to the degree of danger is encompassed in the appropriate standard of care which is determined by the facts of each case.Â  SeeÂ  Stewart v. Motts, 539 Pa. 596, 654 A.2d 535 (1995)(holding the highest degree of care practicable is simply another way of phrasing a standard of reasonable or ordinary care under the circumstances).Â  Furthermore, this instruction is even more inappropriate in a medical malpractice case.Â  Every medical decision encompasses varying degrees of danger.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury Request NumberÂ  8.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury the two requested instructions.Â  We remind the bench and the bar that while treatises and other scholarly works are useful research tools, it is necessary to review controlling case law for the current and correct jury charges. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Apparently, South Carolina is in the minority of the jurisdictions which have ruled on this issue.Â  See Philip G. Peters, The Quiet Demise of Deference to Custom: Malpractice Law at the Millenium, 57 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev.Â  163 (2000). \r\n[2]The following is the entire body of the example notice set out in the appendix of Rule 203 (e):Â  â€œJane C. Roe appeals the order [judgment] of the Honorable George E. Brown dated September 1, 2000.Â  Appellant received written notice of entry of this order [judgment] on September 3, 2000.â€\r\n[3]Although the Ohio instruction is not exactly like the proposed one in this case, it stands for the same principle.Â  It reads, in pertinent part:Â  â€œGREATER DANGER. The amount of care increases in proportion to the danger that reasonably should be foreseen.â€Â  1 OJI 7.10 (2004).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25985","title":"In the Matter fo Hattie E.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P. Turner, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nHattie E. Boyce, of Spartanburg, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to either an admonition or a public reprimand.Â  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as\r\nfollows.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn or about July 9, 2004, respondent was the closing attorney in a real estate transaction.Â  Respondent represented Borrower.Â  Borrower and his wife had obtained approval for an equity credit line loan from Wells Fargo; the loan was to be secured by Borrowerâ€™s residence.Â  Borrower had contacted respondent and requested she assist in a â€œwitness onlyâ€ closing of the line of credit from Wells Fargo.Â Â  \r\nRespondent did not prepare a deed, mortgage, note, or other legal instrument related to the closing of the real estate transaction; she did not ensure that another attorney did so.Â  Neither respondent nor someone under her supervision conducted a title examination or prepared abstracts; respondent did not ensure another attorney or someone under another attorneyâ€™s supervision did so.Â  Neither respondent nor someone under her supervision recorded documents at the Register of Deeds; respondent did not ensure that another attorney or someone under another attorneyâ€™s supervision did so.Â  \r\nRespondent signed the HUD-1 statement certifying thereon that she had prepared the statement, that it was a true and accurate account of the transaction, and that she had or would cause funds or be disbursed in accordance with the statement.Â  Despite signing the HUD-1 statement that she had or would disburse the funds, respondent acknowledges she did not do so.Â  \r\nDespite certifying on the HUD-1 statement that her fee was $100.00 and that the HUD-1 statement was a true and accurate account of the transaction, respondent sought to collect $150.00.Â  The $150.00 fee had been set by respondentâ€™s secretary.Â Â Â  \r\nBorrower told respondent that the attorneyâ€™s fee was to be paid by Wells Fargo.Â  When Wells Fargo did not pay the $150.00 fee, respondent faxed a letter to Borrower and to Borrowerâ€™s employer at their place of business.Â  The letter threatened to sue both Borrower individually and the employerâ€™s business and to send a copy of the lawsuit to both the Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau so as to gain an advantage in the collection of her civil debt.Â  Respondentâ€™s letter threatened treble damages even though she would not be entitled to treble damages under South Carolina law.Â  \r\nNeither Borrowerâ€™s employer nor the employerâ€™s business were a party to the loan.Â  Neither Borrowerâ€™s employer nor his business were clients of respondent.Â  Despite this fact, respondent revealed information relating to her representation of Borrower to his employer without Borrowerâ€™s consent.Â  \r\nRespondent states she was under the mistaken impression that Borrowerâ€™s place of employment was a party to the loan.Â  Respondentâ€™s fee of $150.00 was ultimately paid by Wells Fargo Bank.Â  \r\nRespondent represents her practice is primarily devoted to family law.Â  She submits this is the only real estate closing she has conducted in her thirteen years of practice and that she was unaware of the requirements imposed upon attorneys in the closing of real estate transactions.Â  Respondent further submits she did not fully understand the concept of treble damages.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter discussing this matter and previous Court decisions with ODC, respondent now recognizes that participating in â€œwitness onlyâ€ closings when no other South Carolina licensed attorney is involved has the effect of assisting in the unauthorized practice of law and constitutes a failure to carry out the responsibilities of a closing attorney as provided by previous directives of this Court.Â  She further recognizes she did not provide her client with competent representation.Â  Respondent agrees that her actions constitute misconduct under the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp; \r\nRespondent now recognizes that by signing the HUD-1 settlement statement, she represented that a licensed attorney had disbursed the funds and completed the other steps required of a closing attorney by published directives of the Court when in fact she did not do so.Â  Respondent acknowledges this was misconduct.Â  Respondent further recognizes that the threat of criminal prosecution and collection of civil damages not available under the circumstances constitutes misconduct.Â  \r\nRespondent states her misconduct was unintentional.Â  She represents that, in the future, she will make every effort not to handle matters without first making herself familiar with the applicable guidelines and law.Â  \r\nRespondent has no prior disciplinary history and submits that her conduct in this matter was uncharacteristic.Â  ODC asserts respondent has been very cooperative and forthright during the course of its investigation.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by her misconduct she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.6 (lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless client consents after consultation); Rule 4.5 (lawyer shall not threaten to present criminal charges solely to obtain an advantage in a civil matter); Rule 5.5(b) (lawyer shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Processional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent acknowledges her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the legal profession into disrepute).Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for her misconduct.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.Â Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Barron Grier, III, of Grier Law Firm, LLC, of West Columbia, James Edward Bell, III, of Sumter, and John E. Parker, of Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth &amp; Detrick, PA, of Hampton, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: Â This is an appeal from a circuit court order granting respondent Lands Inn and respondent Clayton summary judgment on an insurance policy coverage question, and holding Lands Inn was entitled to indemnification by appellant (Owners) for a $1.25 million judgment in Claytonâ€™s tort suit.Â  Owners asserts the circuit court erred in finding that coverage was not precluded by the policyâ€™s employment-related practices (ERP) exclusion, and that several other statements in the order are incorrect.Â  We hold that the ERP exclusion does not apply, and that the inaccuracies in the order have not prejudiced Owners.Â  We therefore affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe underlying tort judgment was obtained by Clayton, a former manager of Lands Inn, a motel.Â  Lands Inn fired Clayton for allegedly stealing and embezzling funds.Â  After she was fired, two individuals who called the motel and asked to speak to Clayton were told by a Lands Inn employee that she had been terminated because she had stolen money or misappropriated funds.Â  After a criminal charge against Clayton was nol prossed, she filed a civil suit against Lands Inn.Â  The case was submitted to the jury on three causes of action: malicious prosecution, slander, and negligence.Â  The jury returned a general verdict ofÂ  $1.25 million, of which $500,000 was for compensatory damages and $750,000 for punitive damages.\r\nOwners provided Commercial General Liability (CGL) coverage to Lands Inn.Â  It defended the Clayton suit under a full reservation of rights, but prior to that trial commenced this declaratory judgment suit.Â  Owners now appeals a circuit court order granting Lands Inn summary judgment on the coverage issue and holding Lands Inn entitled to indemnification for the $1.25 million Clayton verdict.[1]  \r\nISSUES\r\nOn appeal, Owners raises these issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1)\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial judge err in finding the policy language ambiguous?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2)\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court err in holding the ERP exclusion did not apply?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3)\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in holding that Owners must indemnify Lands Inn for $1.25 million when the policy limit is $1 million?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4)\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court&rsquo;s order and judgment form contain other inaccuracies?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nA.Â  Ambiguous Policy\r\nThe trial court found the CGL policy â€œpotentiallyâ€ ambiguous since it purported first to cover malicious prosecution and slander, but then to exclude slander in the ERP exclusion.Â  Relying on S.C. State Budget &amp; Control Bd. v. Prince, 304 S.C. 241, 403 S.E.2d 643 (1991), the circuit court concluded that such an inclusion/exclusion situation creates an ambiguity. Â Owners argues that, logically, exclusions can only apply to otherwise covered items, for if the item is not covered it is by definition excluded.Â  We agree with Owners that the trial court misread Prince. \r\nThe policy provides this coverage:\r\n\r\nCOVERAGE A. BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY&nbsp;\r\nDAMAGE LIABILITY\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Insuring Agreement.\r\nWe will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ to which this insurance applies.\r\nCOVERAGE B. PERSONAL AND ADVERTISING\r\nINJURY LIABILITY \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Insuring Agreement\r\nWe will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of â€œpersonal injuryâ€ to which this coverage part applies.\r\n\r\nThe Definitions section of the policy then provides:\r\n\r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œBodily injuryâ€ means bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any one time.\r\n10.Â Â Â Â  â€œPersonal injuryâ€ means, other than â€œbodily injuryâ€, arising out of one or more of the following offenses:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    a.\r\n    False arrest, detention or imprisonment;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    b.\r\n    Malicious prosecution;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    c.\r\n    The wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    d.\r\n    Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person&rsquo;s or organization&rsquo;s goods, products or services; or\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    e.\r\n    Oral or written publication of material that violates a person&rsquo;s right of privacy.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\nThe purported Â â€œambiguityâ€ arises because the ERP exclusion provides:\r\nEMPLOYMENT-RELATED PRACTICES EXCLUSION\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.&nbsp;\r\n      The following exclusion is added to COVERAGE A (Section I): \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      o.\r\n      &ldquo;Bodily injury&rdquo; arising out of any:\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      (1)&nbsp;\r\n      Refusal to employ;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      (2)\r\n      Termination of employment;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      (3)\r\n      Coercion, demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline, defamation, harassment, humiliation, discrimination or other employment-related practices, policies, acts, or omissions; or\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      (4)&nbsp;\r\n      Consequential &ldquo;bodily injury&rdquo; as a result of (1) through (3) above.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      This exclusion applies whether the insured may be held liable as an employer or in any other capacity and to any obligation to share damages with or to repay someone else who must pay damages because of the injury.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n      The following exclusion is added to COVERAGE B (Section I):\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      c.\r\n      &ldquo;Personal injury&rdquo; arising out of any:\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      (1)\r\n      Refusal to employ;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      (2)\r\n      Termination of employment;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      (3)\r\n      Coercion, demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline, defamation, harassment, humiliation, discrimination or other employment-related practices, policies, acts, or omissions; or\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      (4)&nbsp;\r\n      Consequential &ldquo;personal injury&rdquo; as a result of (1) through (3) above.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\nIn Prince, the insurance policy defined â€œpersonal injuriesâ€ to include several intentional torts.Â  The policyâ€™s definition of â€œoccurrence,â€ however, required â€œan accidentâ€¦which results in personal injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.â€Â  The Prince court held that there was an ambiguity in this definitional section, in that the intentional torts defined as â€œpersonal injuriesâ€ were effectively eliminated by the definition of â€œoccurrence.â€Â  We agree with Owners that Prince is inapposite, as here the coverage â€œeliminationâ€ is found in one of the policyâ€™s exclusions, not in inconsistent definitions.\r\nThe trial court erred in finding the policy ambiguous.\r\nB.Â  Application of the ERP Exclusion\r\nInsurance policy exclusions are construed most strongly against the insurance company, which also bears the burden of establishing the exclusionâ€™s applicability.Â  Boggs v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., 272 S.C. 460, 252 S.E.2d 565 (1979).Â  In addition, since the Clayton jury returned a general verdict, a finding that any of the three claims submitted to that jury is not excluded answers the coverage question.Â  See, e.g., Frazier v. Badger, 361 S.C. 94, 603 S.E.2d 587 (2004) (where general verdict is supported by at least one theory it will be upheld on appeal).Â  As discussed below, we find that coverage for the Clayton defamation award is not precluded by the ERP exclusion.\r\nThe ERP exclusion specifically excludes coverage for â€œBodily Injuryâ€ and â€œPersonal Injuryâ€ â€œarising out of anyâ€¦defamationâ€¦or other employment-related practices, policies, acts, or omissionsâ€¦.â€Â  In South Carolina, the term â€œarising out ofâ€ when used in an insurance policy exclusion should be narrowly construed to mean â€œcaused by.â€Â  McPherson v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., 310 S.C. 316, 426 S.E.2d 770 (1993).Â  Further, in determining whether post-termination defamations such as the ones here fall within an ERP exclusion, courts generally inquire whether the statement was made in the context of employment, and whether the statementâ€™s content describes the employeeâ€™s performance.Â  HS Servs. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 109 F.3d 642 (9th Cir. 1997) (defamation not clearly employment related because while statementâ€™s contents related to employment, the statements were not made in the context of employment, but rather to competitors to discourage business dealings with former employee); Adams v. Pro Source, 231 F.Supp.2d 499 (M.D. La. 2002); see also Frank and Freedus v. Allstate Ins. Co., 52 Cal. Rptr.2d 678 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1996) (was post-termination statement directed to performance while employed and made in employment context).\r\nIn her tort suit, Clayton presented evidence of two separate defamations.Â  One occurred when a former hotel guest called Lands Inn and asked to speak with Clayton.Â  When told she â€œwas no longer here,â€ the caller asked whether she had quit and was told Clayton had been â€œlet go.â€Â  When the caller pressed for a reason, the receptionist replied, â€œWell, she misappropriated funds so we let her go.â€Â  The second defamation occurred when a person with whom Clayton had a separate business relationship called the motel to speak with her and was told Clayton had been fired or let loose, and either that she had stolen or embezzled thousands of dollars.[2]\r\nThe trial court correctly held that these defamations were not â€œemployment-relatedâ€ and that therefore the ERP exclusion did not negate Ownersâ€™ obligation to indemnify Lands Inn under the CGL policy.Â  While the substance of the defamatory statements was employment-related, that is, the fact that Clayton had been fired and the reason why, the context was not.Â  The information was not being relayed to other employees to explain Claytonâ€™s termination nor was it conveyed to persons such as potential employers who were inquiring about Claytonâ€™s performance as an employee.Â  Instead, the Lands Inn employee gratuitously relayed the information to Claytonâ€™s acquaintance and to her business associate.Â  The employment context was not present here.\r\nWe therefore affirm the finding that the defamation claim was covered by Ownersâ€™ policy since it was not within the ERP exclusion.Â  HS Servs., supra; Adams v. ProSource, supra; Frank and Freedus, supra.Â  Our holding that the exclusion does not apply to the defamation claim means that Owners must indemnify Lands Inn for the Clayton general verdict.Â  Frazier, supra.Â  Accordingly, we need not address whether the malicious prosecution claim[3] is within the ERP exclusion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nC.Â  Error in Amount of Indemnification\r\nThe order refers to the CGI policyâ€™s $1 million limit several times.Â  In the orderâ€™s final paragraph, however, it requires that Owners indemnify Lands Inn for the full amount of the $1.25 million Clayton verdict.Â  Owners contends this was error in light of the policy limit, and we agree that the $1.25 million reference appears to be a mere scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  We decline to revise this portion of the order on appeal, but do so without prejudice to Ownersâ€™ right to file a Rule 60(a), SCRCP, motion for relief in the circuit court.\r\nD.Â  Other Scrivenersâ€™ Errors\r\nOwners complains that the appealed order and the accompanying judgment form contain several additional clerical errors.Â  Respondents concede these errors exist, but contend that the errors have caused neither prejudice to Owners nor confusion in the circuit court.Â  Owners does not contest respondentsâ€™ contentions.Â  Error without prejudice does not warrant reversal.Â  E.g., Loftis v. SCE&amp;G, 361 S.C. 434, 604 S.E.2d 714 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial court order holding that Owners must indemnify Lands Inn for the Clayton verdict, without prejudice to Ownersâ€™ right to move pursuant to Rule 60(a), SCRCPÂ  for the correction of the amount to be indemnified.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Only the malicious prosecution and defamation theories are involved in this appeal, and the only exclusion issue decided is that of the ERP exclusion.Â  There remain unresolved issues concerning the negligence theory, the failure to cooperate exclusion, and equitable estoppel.\r\n[2] The witness was unclear as to the exact words used.\r\n[3] Clayton was arrested, charged, and indicted for â€œBreach of Trust with Fraudulent Intentâ€ in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-230, based on allegations that Clayton took Lands Innâ€™s money while serving as the businessâ€™s manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25987","title":"Doe v.

Graham Sturgis, Jr., of Charleston, for Amicus Curiae, Darkness to Light. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  In this sexual-abuse action, the circuit court granted summary judgment for Respondent Richard H. Crooks, M.D. (Crooks), holding that the action of Appellant John Doe (Doe) was barred under the statute of limitations.Â  We certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action was commenced in 2002, when Doe was thirty-four years old.Â  He asserts that in 1983, when he was fourteen or fifteen years old, Crooks molested him.Â  \r\nDoe acknowledges that he was aware of the alleged abuse while it was occurring; that he knew at the time that it was wrong; that he immediately began to feel shame; and that he has â€œdealt with this shame since the first time [the abuse] occurred.â€Â  Doe claims, however, that he did not realize the full extent of his injuries until 2001, when he was thirty-three years old.Â  Only then, he claims, did he understand that the molestation caused him to be obsessive about cleanliness, over-protective of his children, and distrustful of others.\r\nThe circuit court held that under the statute of limitations, the time for Doe to commence his action had expired.Â  The court therefore granted summary judgment for Crooks.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nWhether the circuit court erred in holding that Doeâ€™s action was barred under the statute of limitations.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 15-3-555,[1] the current statute of limitations for sexual-abuse actions, was adopted in 2001.Â  See 2001 Act No. 102 (effective August 31, 2001).Â  Prior to 2001, the limitations period was provided by sections 15-3-530(5)[2] and 15-3-535.[3]Â  \r\nOrdinarily, a new statute of limitations applies retroactively.[4]Â  However, it cannot operate to revive an action for which the limitations period has already expired.Â  Such a result would violate the defendantâ€™s rights under the Due Process Clause of the South Carolina Constitution.[5]Â  Goff v. Mills, 279 S.C. 382, 386, 308 S.E.2d 778, 780 (1983); U.S. Rubber Co. v. McManus, 211 S.C. 342, 349, 45 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1947); Stoddard v. Owings, 42 S.C. 88, 92, 20 S.E. 25, 26 (1894).\r\nThe circuit court held that when section 15-3-555 became the statute of limitations governing sexual-abuse cases, Doeâ€™s cause of action had already lapsed under sections 15-3-530(5) and 15-3-535.Â  We agree.Â  Consequently, whether the action is barred under section 15-3-555 is irrelevant.Â  \r\nUnder the discovery rule, the limitations period commences when the plaintiff â€œkn[o]w[s] or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should [know] that he ha[s] a cause of action.â€Â  Â§ 15-3-535.Â  That the injured party may not at that time â€œcomprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial.â€Â  Dean v. Ruson Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 364, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).Â  \r\nAs stated above, Doe acknowledges that he was aware of the alleged abuse when it occurred, when he was a fifteen-year-old minor; that he knew at the time that it was wrong; that he immediately felt shame; and that he has â€œdealt with this shameâ€ ever since.Â  Thus, discovery occurred in 1983, when Doe was fifteen years old.Â  See Doe v. R.D., 308 S.C. 139, 417 S.E.2d 541 (1992) (holding that a plaintiff who was aware of sexual abuse when it was occurring should have known at that time that he had a cause of action). \r\nUnder section 15-3-40(1),[6] the limitations period was tolled until Doe reached the age of majority, eighteen.Â  Under section 15-3-535, Doe then had six years to file his action.[7]Â  In other words, Doe needed to file by the time he turned twenty-four.Â  Because he failed to do so, his cause of action lapsed in 1992, nine years before section 15-3-555 was adopted.Â  We therefore need not address whether the action would be barred under section 15-3-555.Â  The action is barred.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe statute of limitations prevents Doe from pursuing his action.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment for Crooks is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-555 (Supp. 2003).\r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (1976 and Supp. 2003) (regarding actions arising from injury to the person, among other things).\r\n[3] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (1976 and Supp. 2003) (providing the discovery rule for â€œactions initiated under Section 15-3-530(5)â€).\r\n[4] Statutes of limitations generally apply retroactively because they are remedial in nature.Â  The General Assembly may, of course, express its intent that a new statute of limitations applies only prospectively.Â  Jenkins v. Meares, 302 S.C. 142, 146, 394 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1990); Goff v. Mills, 279 S.C. 382, 386, 308 S.E.2d 778, 780 (1983).Â  No such intent is expressed in section 15-3-555.\r\n[5] S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 5. \r\n[6] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n[7] For actions accruing prior to April 5, 1988, the limitations period is six years in duration.Â  The three-year limitations period now found in the Code applies to actions accruing on or after April 5, 1988.Â  1988 Act No. 432. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25988","title":"State v.

App. 2003), in which the court\r\nheld that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter a guilty\r\nplea.&nbsp; We reverse.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nDelbert Smalls (Defendant) was\r\nindicted by a grand jury for second-degree lynching.&nbsp; Defendant pled guilty\r\nto assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN),[1] a charge for which he was never indicted.&nbsp;\r\nDefendant signed a sentencing sheet, which indicated that he waived presentment\r\nto the grand jury and pled guilty to the charge.&nbsp; The sentencing sheet also\r\nreferenced the indictment for lynching but acknowledged that Defendant, â€œin\r\ndisposition of said indictment,â€ pled to ABHAN.&nbsp; He was sentenced as a\r\nyouthful offender for a term not to exceed six years.&nbsp; Defendant appealed.\r\nOn appeal, Defendant contended that\r\nthe circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enter the guilty plea for ABHAN because\r\nDefendant was never indicted for ABHAN.&nbsp; The court of appeals vacated\r\nDefendantâ€™s plea, holding that Defendant could not effectively waive the\r\nindictment for ABHAN because he was never indicted for that charge.&nbsp; The\r\nStateâ€™s motion for rehearing was denied.&nbsp; This Court granted certiorari.\r\nThe issue before this Court is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Does a court have subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea to a charge for which a defendant has not\r\n  been indicted, and where the defendant signs a sentencing sheet acknowledging\r\n  a waiver of presentment to the grand jury?\r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nDefendant argues that the trial\r\ncourt did not have subject matter jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nWe address this issue in light of\r\nthis Courtâ€™s recent decisions in State v. Gentry, Op. No. 25949 (S.C.\r\nSup. Ct. filed March 7, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 37) and Evans v.\r\nState, Op. No. 25963 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 4, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.\r\nNo. 15 at 52).&nbsp; In these cases, we abandoned the view that, in criminal\r\nmatters, the circuit court acquires subject matter jurisdiction to hear a\r\nparticular case by way of a valid indictment.&nbsp; The court of general\r\nsessions has subject matter jurisdiction to try criminal cases.&nbsp; Gentry\r\nat 43 (citing S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 11, which states that the circuit court is\r\nthe general trial court with original jurisdiction in civil and criminal\r\nmatters).\r\nAlthough an indictment does not\r\nconfer subject matter jurisdiction, due process requires that a criminal\r\ndefendant be properly served with a valid indictment. &nbsp;The indictment is a\r\nnotice document that is required by our state constitution and statutes.&nbsp; Evans\r\nat 60.&nbsp; â€œThe primary purposes of an indictment are to put the defendant\r\non notice of what he is called upon to answer, i.e., to appraise him of\r\nthe elements of the offense and to allow him to decide whether to pled guilty or\r\nstand trial.â€&nbsp; Evans at 60.&nbsp; Accordingly, challenges to the\r\nsufficiency of an indictment must be raised before a jury is sworn.&nbsp; Gentry\r\nat 43.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf the challenge is raised before\r\nthe jury is sworn, the circuit court should judge the sufficiency of the\r\nindictment by determining whether (1) the offense is stated with sufficient\r\ncertainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to\r\npronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and\r\nwhether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon; and (2) whether it\r\napprises the defendant of the elements of the offense that is intended to be\r\ncharged.&nbsp; Gentry at 44-45 (citing State v. Wilkes, 353 S.C.\r\n462, 465, 578 S.E.2d 717, 719 (2003)).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe hold that signing a sentencing\r\nsheet for a charge to which a defendant has pled guilty constitutes a written\r\nwaiver of presentment.&nbsp; Moreover, a signed document that informs a\r\ndefendant of the charges against him, such as a sentencing sheet, gives rise to\r\na presumed regularity in the proceedings and signifies that the defendant has\r\nbeen notified of the charges to which he has pled guilty.&nbsp;\r\nIn a criminal case, a defendant who\r\nchooses to plead guilty has ample opportunity to be fully notified of the\r\ncharges he is pleading guilty to.&nbsp; First, a defendant may check a box on\r\nthe sentencing sheet to indicate a waiver of presentment of the indictment to\r\nthe grand jury.&nbsp; Second, a defendant may check a box to indicate that he\r\nwishes to plead guilty.&nbsp; In addition, a defendant may sign the sentencing\r\nsheet, indicating the defendant is informed of the choices and has selected the\r\nbox that corresponds to the course of action the defendant wants to take in the\r\ncase.&nbsp; As a result, we believe that all of these factors indicate that the\r\nDefendant had notice of the charges to which he chose to plead guilty.\r\nIn the present case, Defendant\r\nsigned a sentencing sheet indicating that he waived presentment of the\r\nindictment to the grand jury.&nbsp; However, Defendant pled guilty to a charge\r\nfor which an indictment was not prepared.[2]&nbsp;\r\nBut, we believe that aforementioned factors were present to provide Defendant\r\nwith proper notice.&nbsp; Therefore, we hold that Defendant had notice of the\r\ncharges to which he pled guilty.&nbsp;\r\nConclusion\r\nAccordingly, a defendant may waive\r\npresentment by signing a sentencing sheet that indicates the crime\r\ncharged.&nbsp; Moreover, it is not necessary to prepare another indictment for\r\nthe charge to which Defendant plead guilty.&nbsp; A signed document gives rise\r\nto a presumed regularity in the proceedings that the defendant was informed of\r\nthe charges against him.&nbsp; The court of appealsâ€™ decision is REVERSED and\r\nthe conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; PLEICONES, JJ., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I agree\r\nwith the majority that the Court of Appeals erred in vacating respondentâ€™s\r\nguilty plea, but write separately because I adhere to my dissenting position\r\nexpressed in State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).&nbsp;\r\nIn my opinion, the circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to accept a\r\nguilty plea unless the Grand Jury has returned a True Bill, or unless the\r\ndefendant executes a written waiver of presentment prior to the trial courtâ€™s\r\nacceptance of the plea.&nbsp; S.C Const. art. I, Â§ 11; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n17-23-130 and -140 (2003).\r\n&nbsp;Here, the State relies upon\r\nrespondentâ€™s signature on a sentencing sheet that contains all the information\r\nnecessary for a valid waiver of presentment to meet the statutory requirements[3].&nbsp; While there is nothing in the\r\nrecord that indicates when the sentencing sheet was signed, in the absence of\r\nevidence to the contrary, proceedings in the court of general sessions are\r\npresumed to have been regular.&nbsp; E.g., Pringle v. State, 287\r\nS.C. 409, 339 S.E.2d 127 (1986).&nbsp; Applying this presumption, I conclude\r\nrespondent failed to meet his burden of showing there was no valid waiver of\r\npresentment.&nbsp; For this reason, I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to\r\nreverse the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n[1] Defendant also pled guilty to possession of crack cocaine and\r\npossession of a stolen vehicle, and he was sentenced as a youthful offender not\r\nto exceed five years.&nbsp; These charges are not at issue in this appeal.&nbsp;\r\n[2] In the words of the circuit court judge, Defendant was â€œpleading\r\ndownâ€ to the charge.\r\n[3] I disagree with the Court of Appeals that the Constitution and the\r\nstatutes require the preparation of an indictment as a prerequisite to a waiver\r\nof presentment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25989","title":"State v.

Clare, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  The Court granted certiorari to consider an en banc decision of the Court of Appeals holding that extraterritorial jurisdiction is a component of subject matter jurisdiction such that the issue could be raised and considered for the first time on appeal.Â  State v. Dudley, 354 S.C. 514, 581 S.E.2d 171 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent, a resident of the Atlanta area, was a long time friend of Donald Stokes.Â  Stokes and Earl Hale, residents of Roanoke, Virginia, were drug dealers.Â  Stokes called respondent from Virginia and told her he and Hale were coming to Atlanta.Â  Once there, the men contacted respondent and arranged to purchase cocaine from her.Â  Stokes and Hale left Atlanta, driving back to Roanoke with the drugs.\r\nStokes and Hale were stopped on Interstate 85 in Anderson County, South Carolina.Â  Hale, the driver, consented to a search of the vehicle, which led to the discovery of 249 grams of powder cocaine.Â  Stokes and Hale were arrested.Â  The men then entered â€œsubstantial assistance agreementsâ€ whereby they agreed to assist law enforcement agencies in Virginia and South Carolina in making drug cases.Â  They identified respondent as the supplier of the 249 grams.Â  \r\nStokes, monitored by law enforcement officers, made several phone calls to respondent in an attempt to set up the purchase of more cocaine.[1]Â  While respondent agreed to expedite a deal, she declined to meet Stokes and Hale in South Carolina to consummate it.Â  Eventually Stokes, in the company of several law enforcement officers, traveled to the Atlanta area.Â  Once there, Stokes, at the direction of the officers, made excuses why he could not come further into the city as respondent requested.Â  Finally, respondent came to Stokes who was waiting in a suburban Atlanta parking lot.Â  When respondent arrived, she was arrested by South Carolina authorities.Â  She had no cocaine in her possession at the time of her arrest.\r\nRespondent was indicted for trafficking cocaine by aiding and abetting Stokes and Hale in bringing the 249 grams of cocaine into South Carolina (trafficking charge).Â  She was indicted for conspiring to traffic cocaine in Anderson County in connection with the second planned sale (conspiracy charge).Â  Respondent was convicted of both trafficking and conspiracy and received concurrent twenty-five year sentences and was ordered to pay two six-thousand-dollar fines.\r\nA panel of the Court of Appeals reversed respondentâ€™s conspiracy conviction, and by a vote of two to one, affirmed the trafficking conviction.Â  Judge Connor dissented, and would have vacated both convictions finding South Carolina lacked extraterritorial jurisdiction.\r\nA petition for rehearing en banc was granted to consider the validity of the trafficking conviction.[2]Â  The en banc majority concluded that the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction was a component of subject matter jurisdiction that could be raised for the first time on appeal, and vacated respondentâ€™s conviction, finding no evidence she intended a detrimental effect in South Carolina.Â  In dissent, Judge Anderson maintained respondent was raising a personal jurisdiction claim, which she had waived by failing to object at trial.Â  He nevertheless held there was evidence of â€œintended effectsâ€ in South Carolina as to the trafficking charge.Â  Judge Stilwell also dissented, and would have held that extraterritorial jurisdiction was not an element of subject matter jurisdiction, but was either a component of personal jurisdiction or some third type, and that in any case respondent had waived any right to complain by not objecting at trial.Â  He, too, would have affirmed the trafficking conviction.\r\nWe granted certiorari to review the en banc decision.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Is the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction a component of subject matter jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Court of Appeals en banc majority erred in holding that extraterritorial jurisdiction is a component of subject matter jurisdiction. Subject matter jurisdiction refers to the courtâ€™s power â€œto hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings belongâ€¦.â€ State v. Gentry, Op. No. 25949 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 7, 2005).Â  The circuit court has original jurisdiction in all criminal matters except those where an inferior court is given exclusive jurisdiction.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11 (Supp. 2004).Â  Magistrates and municipal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over all state criminal charges where the punishment does not exceed a fine of one hundred dollars or imprisonment for thirty days.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-540 (1988); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-45 (Supp. 2004).Â  Trafficking in cocaine, the crime at issue here, is punishable by a minimum sentence of three years and a $25,000 fine.[3]Â  It therefore exceeds the inferior courtsâ€™ exclusive jurisdictional limits.Â  The circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction over the general class of trafficking charges.Â  Gentry, supra.Â  \r\nAlthough territorial jurisdiction is not a component of subject matter jurisdiction, we hold that it is a fundamental issue that may be raised by a party or by a court at any point in the proceeding.Â  Compare, e.g., Gordon v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 818, 568 S.E.2d 452 (Ct. App. 2002) (claim that crime did not occur in state not waived by failure to timely raise it).Â  The exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction implicates the stateâ€™s sovereignty,[4] a question so elemental that we hold it cannot be waived by conduct or by consent. \r\nWhile a defendant need not be physically present in the State in order to commit a criminal offense here, the Stateâ€™s extraterritorial jurisdiction extends only to those who have performed acts â€œintended to produce and producing detrimental effects withinâ€ our boundaries.Â  Strassheim v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280, 31 S. Ct. 558, 55 L.Ed. 735 (1911); see also State v. Morrow, 40 S.C. 221, 18 S.E. 833 (1893).Â  We agree with the Court of Appeals majority that there is no evidence that respondent intended a detrimental effect in South Carolina when she sold the cocaine to Stokes and Hale.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The record does not indicate that respondent was aware that these calls originated in South Carolina.\r\n[2] The State has not challenged the reversal of the conspiracy conviction.\r\n[3] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2) (2002).\r\n[4] See S.C. Code Ann.

South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co., 356 S.C. 165, 588 S.E.2d 116 (2003).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nRespondent Karl Albert Overcash, III (Overcash) brought this action seeking damages against Appellant South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company (SCE&amp;G) for the injuries he sustained, alleging, among other things, statutory and common law public nuisance.Â  Overcash was severely injured when his boat collided with a dock owned by Sarah and Crawford Clarkson.Â  Overcash alleges the dock connected the Clarksonâ€™s property to a small island more than 200 feet from their property and across the navigable waters of Lake Murray.Â  Overcash further alleges SCE&amp;G allowed the dock to be built, deeded the island to the Clarksons, and granted a post-construction permit for the dock.Â  \r\nThe Clarksons settled the claims against them and are no longer a party to the suit.Â  The circuit court granted SCE&amp;Gâ€™s motion to dismiss Overcashâ€™s public nuisance cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, concluding:Â  (1) personal injuries are not â€œ special injuriesâ€ and thus cannot be the basis for a private action for public nuisance; and (2) a private cause of action for public nuisance does not exist pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 49-1-10 (1987).\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to circuit court concluding: (1) Overcash could maintain a common law cause of action under the doctrine of public nuisance for merely personal injuries; and (2) S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 49-1-10 provides a private, statutory cause of action for public nuisance.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err in recognizing a common law cause of action under the doctrine of public nuisance for purely personal injuries?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err in holding S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 49-1-10 provides a private, statutory cause of action for public nuisance?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA motion to dismiss a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, must be based solely on the allegations set forth on the face of the complaint.Â  The motion will not be sustained if the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.Â  Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987).Â Â  â€œ[A] judgment on the pleadings is considered to be a drastic procedure by our courts.â€Â  Russell v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 89, 406 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991).Â  Therefore, pleadings in a case should be construed liberally and the Court must presume all well pled facts to be true so that substantial justice is done between the parties.Â  Stroud v. Riddle, 260 S.C. 99, 102, 194 S.E.2d 235, 237 (1973).\r\nI.\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded Overcashâ€™s personal injuries constitute direct and special injuries, which support a private tort action for public nuisance. Â Â We decline to venture into what William Prosser has termed the â€œimpenetrable jungle,â€ electing instead to follow the well-beaten path to which South Carolina nuisance jurisprudence has long adhered.Â  See W. Page Keeton, Dan B. Dobbs, Robert E. Keeton &amp; David G. Owen, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts Â§ 86 at 616 (5th ed. 1984).Â  We reverse.\r\nUnder English common law, an action for nuisance was reserved for an interference with the use or enjoyment of rights in land.Â  William L. Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997 (1966).Â  As noted by the Court of Appeals, modern nuisance law originates from the medieval English criminal writ of â€œpurpresture.â€Â  The earliest cases involved purprestures, encroachments upon the royal domain or the kingâ€™s highway, and were redressed by the crown in a criminal proceeding.Â  According to Prosser, â€œ[t]here was sufficient superficial resemblance between the obstruction of a private right of way and the obstruction of a public right of passage to content the judges with calling the latter a nuisance as well.â€Â  Id. at 998.Â  Thus was born the public nuisance.Â  Over time, the public nuisance doctrine has been expanded to cover other invasions of the rights of the general public including violations of the public order, decency, morals, and health.Â  58 Am. Jur. 2d Nuisances Â§ 39 (2002).\r\nThe dissent by Justice Fitzherbert in a 1536 Kingâ€™s Bench decision derailed the course of nuisance law as a branch of the common law, which once dealt only with harm to real property.Â  Justice Fitzherbert argued against the contemporaneous understanding of the law in advocating an individualâ€™s action for special or particular damage, including personal injury, should be recognized under a cause of action for public nuisance. Y.B. Mich. 27 Hen. 8, f. 26, pl. 10 (1536).Â  Although Justice Fitzherbertâ€™s view has been widely followed by other courts, we decline to recognize a common law cause of action under the doctrine of public nuisance for purely personal injuries.\r\nSouth Carolina has avoided the uncertainty and confusion surrounding personal injuries in public nuisance actions.Â  The cases in South Carolina concerning a private action for a public nuisance have involved an alleged damage to an individualâ€™s real or personal property as the â€œspecial injuryâ€ required to maintain an action for public nuisance. See e.g., Burrell v. Kirkland, 242 S.C. 201, 130 S.E.2d 470 (1963) (abutting landowner requested injunction for neighborsâ€™ obstruction of public road); Huggin v. Gaffney Dev. Co., 229 S.C. 340, 92 S.E.2d 883 (1956) (plaintiff sues for damages on alleged obstruction of public road alleging he was unable to obtain agricultural labor from a source at the opposite end of the road); Crosby v. Southern Ry. Co., 221 S.C. 135, 69 S.E.2d 209 (1952) (plaintiff alleged diminution in value of real property cause by blocked street). \r\nThis Court has never specifically concluded that an individual has a common law cause of action under the doctrine of public nuisance for purely personal injuries. Â The Court of Appeals relies on the decisions in Drews v. Burton &amp; Co., 76 S.C. 362, 57 S.E. 176 (1907) and Carey v. Brooks, 19 S.C.L. 365, 1833 WL 1682 (Ct. App. 1833).Â  In Drews, the plaintiff brought an action for negligence arguing that a log from the defendantâ€™s mill drifted into navigable waters and damaged the plaintiffâ€™s schooner.Â  In deciding the merits of the defendantâ€™s argument, the Court found that Section 1335 of the Code of Laws of 1902 provided that any person who obstructed a navigable waterway was guilty of nuisance. The Court, citing Carey, stated â€œ[w]hen a person sustains a special injury . . . arising from the obstruction of a navigable stream, he is entitled to recover damages, on the ground that such obstruction constitutes a nuisance under the statute, as well as at common law.â€Â  Id. 76 S.C. at 366, 57 S.E. at 178.Â  \r\nThe decision in Drews does not recognize a cause of action for purely personal injuries under a public nuisance theory.Â  In Drews, the plaintiff alleged property damage to his schooner, not injuries to his person.Â  We do not read the Courtâ€™s holding to sanction an individualâ€™s recovery for personal injuries in a public nuisance action.Â  \r\nLikewise, the decision in Carey, did not involve personal injuries.Â  In Carey, the plaintiff brought an action to recover for the obstruction of a navigable waterway, a public nuisance.Â  The obstruction caused a delay in the delivery of the plaintiffâ€™s lumber to a third party, which resulted in damages.Â  The court concluded if by such nuisance, a party suffers a particular damage, the plaintiff could recover.Â  The Court of Appeals then recited Justice Fitzherbertâ€™s general illustration regarding corporeal hurt to the individual as constituting a â€œspecial injury.â€ [1] We conclude the Court of Appeals rested its decision in large part on the dicta contained in this case.Â  To the extent the decisions in Drews and Carey suggest we recognize a cause of action for purely personal injuries under the doctrine of public nuisance, we hereby overrule those cases.[2]Â Â Â  \r\nWe conclude the special or particular injury requirement necessary for an individual to maintain a cause of action for public nuisance is satisfied only by injury to the individualâ€™s real or personal property.Â Â  For the protection of the person, South Carolina has well developed tort-based doctrines which can redress wrongs resulting in personal injuries sustained by an individual.Â  The addition of personal injury to public nuisance actions in South Carolina would perpetuate the erosion of any semblance of doctrinal consistency in the common law of nuisance.Â  Therefore, we reverse.\r\nII.\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding that a private right of action exists from a violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 49-1-10 (1987).Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection 49-1-10 provides the following:\r\n\r\n  â€¦ [A]ll navigable watercourses and cuts are hereby declared navigable streams and such streams shall be common highwaysÂ  and forever freeÂ  . . . . If any person shall obstruct any such stream . . . , such person shall be guilty of a nuisance and such obstruction may be abated as other public nuisances are by law.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals improperly relied on Drews, 76 S.C. 362, 57 S.E. 176, and failed to look for intent on the part of the legislature to create a private cause of action.Â  In Drews, the Court found that Section 1335 of the Code of Laws of 1902 provided that any person who obstructed a navigable waterway was guilty of a nuisance.Â  The Court also stated in dicta that a person who sustains a special injury from the obstruction of navigable waterways is able to recover damages on the ground that such an obstruction constitutes a nuisance both under the statute and at common law.Â  Drews, 76 S.C. at 366, 57 S.E. 176 at 178.\r\nSection 1335 provided â€œif any person shall obstruct [a navigable waterway], . . .such person shall be deemed guilty of nuisance, and any such obstruction may be abated as other public nuisances are by the laws of this State.â€Â  Section 1335 and Section 49-1-10 are practically identical in substance.Â  However, the issue of a private right of action under Section 1335 was not squarely before the Court in Drews.Â  \r\nThe main factor in determining whether a statute creates a private cause of action is legislative intent.Â  Dorman v. Aiken Communications, Inc., 303 S.C. 63, 398 S.E.2d 687 (1990).Â  In Dorman, we stated,\r\n\r\n  The legislative intent to grant or withhold a private right of action for violation of a statute or the failure to perform a statutory duty, is determined primarily from the language of the statute . . . . In this respect, the general rule is that a statute which does not purport to establish a civil liability, but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare of the public as an entity is not subject to a construction establishing a civil liability.\r\n\r\nId. at 67, 398 S.E.2d at 689 (quoting Whitworth v. Fast Fare Markets of S.C., Inc., 289 S.C. 418, 420, 338 S.E.2d 155, 156 (1985)).\r\nSection 49-1-10 reveals no legislative intent to create a private cause of action.Â  Section 49-1-10 is found within the section of the Code entitled Waters, Water Resources, and Drainage.Â  The section contains criminal penalties and allows for abatement of the nuisance.Â  The statute is primarily for the benefit and protection of the public generally, and we conclude no private right of action exists for its violation.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion reversing the circuit courtâ€™s order dismissing Overcashâ€™s cause of action for public nuisance is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in part and concurring in part in a separate opinion in which Perry M. Buckner, concurs.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I join in Part II of the opinion, but decline to join in Part I.Â  In my view, a plaintiff may maintain a cause of action for public nuisance for personal injuries upon a showing of special injury.Â  Therefore, I dissent in part; and would affirm the court of appeals in result.\r\nIn my opinion, the majority misconstrues the concept of a public nuisance.Â  According to the majority, Overcashâ€™s personal injuries can be separated from the injury to property.Â  In my view, no distinction can be drawn between personal physical injury and injury to property.Â  I cannot find a rationale to separate Overcashâ€™s physical injury from that of his boat.Â  As the majority construes common law nuisance, Overcash can recover for the injury to his boat, but not for the injury to his person.Â  I think this approach is illogical and flies in the face of basic hornbook law.Â  See Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 821C (stating that when a public nuisance causes personal injury to the plaintiff or physical harm to his land or chattels, the harm is normally different in kind from that suffered by the other members of the pubic and the tort action may be maintained); Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997, 1012 (1966) (opining that there can now be no doubt that the nuisance action can be maintained where a public nuisance causes physical injury); 58 Am. Jur. 2d Nuisances Â§ 252 (2002) (stating that personal injuries are sufficient to show an individualâ€™s peculiar injury as required to maintain an action for public nuisance and injuries to a personâ€™s health are by their nature special and peculiar for the purposes of maintaining such an action).\r\nAccordingly, I would affirm the holding of the court of appeals recognizing a common law cause of action for public nuisance for personal injury and remand the case to circuit court for trial on that cause of action.Â  In addition, I would reverse the decision to recognize a private cause of action under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 49-1-10 (1987).\r\nActing Justice Perry M. Buckner, concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Justice Fitzherbertâ€™s famous hypothetical is the origin of the modern special injury rule, which is often referred to and widely accepted by courts.Â  Fitzherbert envisioned a rider on horseback who is thrown when he encounters a ditch across the highway.Â  Because the rider was injured and suffered greater damage than all others, Fitzherbert argued the rider should have action for public nuisance against the maker of the ditch.Â  See Y.B. Mich. 27 Hen. 8, f. 26, pl. 10 (1536).\r\n[2]Â The decisions in Brown v. Hendricks, 211 S.C. 395, 45 S.E.2d 603 (1947) and Bowlin v. George, 239 S.C. 429, 123 S.E.2d 528 (1962) also contain dicta stating the â€œspecial injuryâ€ requirement would be satisfied by injury to â€œproperty or health.â€Â  To the extent an injury to â€œhealthâ€ implies personal injuries, we decline to adopt the dicta in these cases suggesting an individual has a cause of action in public nuisance for purely personal injuries.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25991","title":"Coon v.

Cash, and Donald Bruce Clark, both of Charleston, for Petitioner.\r\n        Ronald L. Richter, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This is a divorce case.Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review Coon v. Coon, 356 S.C. 342, 588 S.E.2d 624 (Ct. App. 2003), in which the Court of Appeals reversed the family courtâ€™s decision to vacate a domestic-relations order.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPursuant to the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement, the family court entered an order that apportioned Mr. Coonâ€™s United States Department of Defense (DOD) retired pay.Â  Under the order, Mrs. Coon was to receive one hundred percent of Mr. Coonâ€™s â€œdisposable retired payâ€[1] for nine years, and thereafter receive fifty percent.Â  The order provided that the DOD plan administrator pay Mrs. Coon directly. \r\nThe order was never sent to the plan administrator, however.Â  All of the retired pay was paid directly to Mr. Coon, who, in turn, remitted the money to Mrs. Coon.Â  Under this arrangement, Mr. Coon was deemed the recipient of all of the retired pay and was thus responsible for all of the taxes.Â  \r\nAt some point, Mr. Coon increased the amount of federal income tax withholding from the retired pay, causing a decrease in the net amount remitted to Mrs. Coon.Â  Mrs. Coon petitioned for a rule to show cause why Mr. Coon was not in contempt of the family courtâ€™s order.Â  In response, Mr. Coon moved the family court pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, to vacate the portion of the order distributing the retired pay.Â  Mr. Coon argued that under the Uniformed Services Former Spousesâ€™ Protection Act (the USFSPA or the Act),[2] the family court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to order that Mrs. Coon receive more than fifty percent of Mr. Coonâ€™s disposable retired pay.Â  Accordingly, Mr. Coon argued, the order was void.Â  The family court agreed and vacated the order.Â  Mrs. Coon appealed.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the family court had subject-matter jurisdiction to apportion all of Mr. Coonâ€™s disposable retired pay, although the court lacked â€œauthorityâ€ to distribute more than half to Mrs. Coon.Â  In other words, the family court committed a substantive error but not a jurisdictional one, so Mr. Coon was not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(4).Â  The Court of Appeals ordered the reinstatement of the order and remanded for further proceedings.[3]\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether the family court had subject-matter jurisdiction to distribute to Mrs. Coon more than fifty percent of Mr. Coonâ€™s disposable retired pay.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the family court committed an error of law but did not lack subject-matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\nâ€œOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding [if] â€¦ the judgment is void.â€Â  Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â  A judgment of a court without subject-matter jurisdiction is void.Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham and Co., 318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995).Â  Subject-matter jurisdiction is the â€œpower to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Dove v. Gold Kist, 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994).Â  By statute, the family court has subject-matter jurisdiction to decide divorce actions and apportion marital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-420(2) and 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nIn McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.S. 210, 101 S. Ct. 2728, 69 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1981), the United States Supreme Court held that the military-retirement statutes then in force prohibited states from dividing military retired pay pursuant to state community-property laws.Â  McCarty applied with like force to equitable-distribution states such as South Carolina.Â  SeeÂ  Brown v. Brown, 279 S.C. 116, 118, 302 S.E.2d 860, 861 (1983) (citing Bugg v. Bugg, 277 S.C. 270, 286 S.E.2d 135 (1982)).Â  In response to McCarty, Congress enacted the USFSPA.\r\nThe USFSPA permits any court of â€œcompetent jurisdictionâ€ to â€œtreat disposable retired pay payable to a [service] member â€¦ either as property solely of the member or as property of the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of such court.â€Â  10 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1408(a)(1) and (c)(1) (1998).Â  In other words, states have a choice whether to treat disposable retired pay as marital property.Â  South Carolina has chosen to do so.Â  See Tiffault v. Tiffault, 303 S.C. 391, 392, 401 S.E.2d 157, 157 (1991); Brown, 279 S.C. at 118, 302 S.E.2d at 861.Â  \r\nA courtâ€™s authority, however, is subject to the following limitation: â€œThe total amount of the disposable retired pay of a member payable under all court orders pursuant to subsection (c) may not exceed 50 percent of such disposable retired pay.â€Â  10 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1408(e)(1).Â  As the Court of Appeals noted, this limitation applies whether the non-military spouse receives payments directly from the Department of Defense, from the service-member spouse, or a combination of the two.Â  Coon, 356 S.C. at 349-50, 588 S.E.2d at 628.Â  \r\nMr. Coon argues that the fifty-percent limitation prevents state courts from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction over the protected half of disposable retired pay.Â  We disagree.Â  The limitation supplants state domestic-relations law pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution,[4] but it does not pre-empt state-court subject-matter jurisdiction.[5]Â  See, e.g., Curtis v. Curtis, 7 Cal. App. 4th 1, 9 Cal. Rptr. 145 (Cal. Ct. App. 1st Dist. 1992) (holding that neither the McCarty decision nor the USFSPA involves subject-matter jurisdiction); Mansell v. Mansell, 217 Cal. App. 3d 219, 265 Cal. Rptr. 227 (Cal. Ct. App. 5th Dist. 1989)[6] (same), cert. denied, Mansell v. Mansell, 498 U.S. 806, 111 S. Ct. 237, 112 L. Ed. 2d 197 (1990); Evans v. Evans, 75 Md. App. 364, 541 A.2d 648 (1988) (same).Â  The USFSPA neither confers subject-matter jurisdiction on any court nor takes jurisdiction from any court.Â  See Brown v. Harms, 863 F. Supp. 278, 280-81 (E.D. Va. 1994) (holding that federal courts are given no federal-question jurisdiction by the Act and finding that â€œthe Act does no more than make clear that courts of competent jurisdiction, namely courts that already have subject matter jurisdiction from some proper source extrinsic to the Act, may treat a military pensionâ€ as marital property).Â  \r\nAs the Court of Appeals noted, the USFSPA expresses no intention on Congressâ€™s part to pre-empt state-court jurisdiction.Â  Coon, 356 S.C. at 351, 588 S.E.2d at 629.Â  Further, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the use of the term â€œjurisdictionâ€ in the 1990 House Report on the subsection (e)(1) amendment is unpersuasive.Â  See H.R. Rep. No. 101-665, at 3005 (1990); Coon, 356 S.C. at 350, 588 S.E.2d at 628 (finding that by â€œjurisdiction,â€ the House meant â€œauthorityâ€).[7] \r\nÂ We disagree, however, with the Court of Appealsâ€™ suggestion that the USFSPAâ€™s savings clause, section 1408(e)(5), â€œfurther undermines any argument that Congress explicitly directed the fifty-percent limitation is jurisdictional â€¦.â€Â  Coon, 356 S.C. at 351-52, 588 S.E.2d at 629.Â  As already stated, the Act does not address subject-matter jurisdiction in any respect.Â  It follows that the savings clause does not impact the jurisdiction issue one way or the other.Â  \r\nAs stated above, the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding was correct.Â  The Act does not pre-empt state-court jurisdiction, so the family courtâ€™s jurisdiction is strictly a matter of South Carolina law.Â  In this case, the family court did not exceed its jurisdiction.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-420(2) and 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004); Dove, 314 S.C. at 237-38, 442 S.E.2d at 600.Â  That the family court erred in failing to follow pre-emptive federal law does not change this result.Â  Thus, Mr. Coon is not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family courtâ€™s order is not void for want of subject-matter jurisdiction, so the family court erred when it vacated the order.Â  We therefore affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to reverse the vacatur and remand the case to the family court.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œDisposable retired payâ€ is â€œthe total monthly retired pay to which a member [of the military] is entitled lessâ€ certain amounts listed in the statute.Â  10 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1408(a)(4) (1998).Â  \r\n[2] 10 U.S.C. Â§ 1408 (1998 and Supp. 2004).\r\n[3] The further proceedings contemplated by the Court of Appeals relate to the rule to show cause and to a subsequent motion filed by Mrs. Coon to reform the family courtâ€™s order.Â  Because we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision on the merits, we also affirm the decision to remand. \r\n[4] U.S. Const. art. VI. \r\n[5] We respectfully disagree with the Supreme Court of Alaska, which recently held that the fifty-percent limitation is jurisdictional.Â  Cline v. Cline, 90 P.3d 147, 152-54 (Alaska 2004).\r\n[6] This California case was on remand from Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 109 S. Ct. 2023, 104 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1989).Â  There, the United States Supreme Court held that the USFSPA prevented â€œmilitary retirement pay waived by the retiree in order to receive veteransâ€™ disability benefitsâ€ from being apportioned pursuant to state community-property (or equitable-distribution) laws.Â  The reason was that in the Act Congress did not grant the states permission to apportion disability benefits.Â  Thus, the pre-emption found in McCarty remained with respect to those benefits. \r\n[7] Even the United States Supreme Court, in an unrelated matter, has recently stated: â€œâ€˜Jurisdictionâ€™ â€¦ is a word of many, too many, meanings. â€¦ Clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label â€˜jurisdictionalâ€™ â€¦ only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a courtâ€™s adjudicatory authority.â€Â  Kontrick v.
