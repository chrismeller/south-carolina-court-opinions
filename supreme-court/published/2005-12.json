The majority of these transactions involved rental properties owned by Client A, Client Aâ€™s company, or Client Aâ€™s mother.Â  The properties were managed by a third party (Manager).Â  Respondent was made aware of the arrangement between Client A and Manager in which Client A would transfer title to the properties to Manager after Manager renovated the properties and secured the necessary financing.Â  From May through December 1998, respondent recorded approximately twenty-one deeds transferring property from Client A to Manager.Â  \r\nIn or about October 1998, respondent conducted a closing on three lots in Greenville County.Â  Client A was not present at the closing.Â  Manager presented respondent with the deeds conveying the properties to Manager. The deeds were purportedly signed by Client A on his own behalf and on behalf of his mother as attorney-in-fact. Â According to respondent, Manager informed him that Client A could not attend the closing and had asked Manager to present the deeds to respondent for closing.Â  The deeds were signed, notarized, and appeared in recordable form. Â Respondent issued checks from his trust account for the proceeds of the loan payable to Manager and either Client A or Client Aâ€™s mother as co-payees of Manager.Â  The checks were delivered to Manager.Â  Prior to the closing and the issuance of the checks, respondent did not contact Client A or his mother to verify the representations made by Manager, to confirm the validity of the signatures on the deeds, or to obtain permission to release the checks to Manager.Â  Â Â \r\nSubsequent to the transaction, respondent learned that Client Aâ€™s signatures had been forged and that the checks had been negotiated without Client Aâ€™s consent.Â  Respondent admits he should not have allowed himself to be duped by Manager.Â  Respondent has reached a financial settlement with Client A.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he failed to promptly respond to the requests for information regarding this matter.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondentâ€™s firm was retained by First Palmetto Savings Bank (Bank) to act as the closing attorney for various real estate transactions.Â  As of October 24, 2002, respondentâ€™s firm had failed to supply Bank with the recorded mortgages and final title policies for ten closings.Â  Most of these documents were approximately six months overdue; one closing occurred more than ten months earlier.Â  Bankâ€™s repeated attempts to communicate with respondentâ€™s firm through written correspondence and telephone calls met with no success.Â  \r\nEventually, the documents were provided to Bank.Â  Respondent regrets that the documents were not furnished in a timelier manner.Â  Although the transactions occurred in an office location where respondent did not work, he admits that certain internal controls in the office were ineffective.Â  In addition, respondent admits his supervisory responsibility for the office was deficient.\r\nMatter III\r\nRespondentâ€™s firm was retained by Bank to act as the closing attorney for a real estate transaction which occurred on March 22, 2002.Â  As of April 21, 2003, respondentâ€™s firm had failed to provide Bank with the recorded mortgage and final title policy for the transaction.Â  Bankâ€™s repeated attempts to communicate with respondentâ€™s firm through written correspondence and telephone calls met without success.Â  \r\nThe documents were eventually provided to Bank. Â Respondent regrets that the documents were not provided to Bank in a timelier manner. Â Although this transaction occurred in an office location where respondent did not work (and different from the office in Matter II), respondent admits that certain internal controls in the office were ineffective.Â  In addition, respondent admits that his supervisory responsibility for the conduct of the office was deficient.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 5.1 (partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that lawyers in firm conform to Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).[1]Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  MOORE, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26077","title":"In the Matter of James T.

Steedley Bogan, of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand or a definite suspension not to exceed thirty (30) days.Â  See Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for a thirty (30) day period.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn June 1999, Client A retained respondent.Â  Client A had sustained injuries in an automobile accident in July 1998.Â  Although respondent was initially active in handling Client Aâ€™s case, respondent ceased any work on the matter in October 2000. \r\nDuring the same period of time, respondent had been retained to represent Client A in regard to a hit and run accident which had occurred in June 1999. Â Respondent received several telephone calls and written correspondence from Client Aâ€™s insurance company requesting that respondent provide the company with necessary information to process the claim.Â  Respondent failed to respond to these requests, even after the insurance company informed respondent that it would close its file if respondent did not supply the requested information.Â  Client A was unaware of respondentâ€™s lack of diligence in this matter.Â  \r\nIn November 2002, respondent notified Client A that he needed to pick up his files for both accident cases.Â  Respondent allowed the statue of limitations to expire on the 1999 case and relatively little progress had been made on the 1998 case since respondentâ€™s representation began.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nIn April 2000, Client B retained respondent to handle a claim a false arrest against a finance company.Â  Respondent signed a written contingency fee agreement on April 13, 2000.Â  Respondent represents that, shortly after signing the retainer agreement, he orally informed Client B that he was withdrawing from representation because Client Bâ€™s case was not viable. There is no written documentation memorializing respondentâ€™s withdrawal.Â Â  \r\nClient B continued to periodically contact respondent seeking an update on his case.Â  The only written evidence of the termination of the attorney/client relationship is a release signed by Client B in June 2003 which states â€œI, [Client B], acknowledge receipt of my entire file regarding [Defendant A and Defendant B] and therefore do not hold McBratney Law Firm responsible for this matter.â€Â  This release was signed well after the expiration of the statute of limitations on Client Bâ€™s case.Â  Respondent is unable to demonstrate that he appropriately advised Client B of the termination of the representation in a manner that would protect Client Bâ€™s rights and give reasonable notice to Client B to allow him the opportunity to retain subsequent counsel.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nIn or about January 2001, Client C filed an application with the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board (the Board) requesting a refund of the $20,000 retainer paid to respondent for representation in a criminal case.Â  On July 22, 2002, a Hearing Panel of the Board issued a finding and opinion recommending respondent refund $10,000 of the fee to the client.Â  Respondent appealed this decision to the circuit court.\r\nOn appeal of the Boardâ€™s judgment, the circuit court issued an order dated February 3, 2003, upholding the Boardâ€™s decision and compelling respondent to tender payment within thirty (30) days of the date of the order.Â  Respondent failed to comply with the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nOn March 3, 2003, Client C initiated supplementary proceedings seeking compensation.Â  On June 9, 2003, respondent forwarded a payment in the amount of $5,000 to Client C.Â  On July 1, 2003, respondent submitted final payment of $6,167 to Client C to conclude the matter.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter); Rule 1.5 (lawyerâ€™s fee shall be reasonable); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver funds to which client is entitled to receive); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall protect clientâ€™s interests, including giving reasonable notice to client to allow for time to retain other counsel, surrendering papers and property which client is entitled to receive, and refunding any advance payment of fee which had not been earned); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of the client); and\r\nRule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct).[1]Â  Respondent further admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(10) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail to comply with a final decision of the Resolution of Fee Dispute Board). Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for a thirty (30) day period.[2]Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  MOORE, J., not participating. \r\n\r\n[1] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n[2] ODCâ€™s request to appoint an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests is denied.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26078","title":"Edge v.

Â \r\nAfter the accident, the plaintiffsâ€™ policies were ceded to the Facility.[1]Â  As a result of State Farmâ€™s Â fault determination of the accidents, two merit ratings points were assigned to each plaintiff and their premiumsÂ  increased.Â  Edgeâ€™s six-month premium beginning in October 1997 increased from $425.77 to $1,088.83, or approximately $660. Greenâ€™s six-month premium increased from $386 to $1,700, or approximately $1,314. \r\nInstead of paying the higher premium, Edge applied for insurance with Horace Mann Insurance.Â  Horace Mann notified her that State Farm had reported the accident to the Comprehensive Underwriting Exchange and she would be assessed two surcharge points and her premiums would be substantially higher. Edge paid the increased premium for the Horace Mann policy for four days.Â  Horace Mann later removed the surcharge, refunded the increase, and lowered the premium rate after Edge provided documentation that Shull had been convicted in connection with the accident.Â  Green was billed for the higher premiums but subsequently the merit points were removed, and he never actually paid anyÂ  increased premium.\r\nThe plaintiffs brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment and damages for breach of contract, breach of statute, and conspiracy against State Farm and the Facility. The circuit court denied State Farmâ€™s 12(b)(8) motion; granted the Facilityâ€™s motion to dismiss; and in two separate orders, denied in part and granted in part State Farmâ€™s 12 (b)(1) and (6) motion dismissing several causes of action.[2]Â  \r\nBasically, the issues in this case center around two underlying questions: 1) whether State Farm can unilaterally determine whether a driver is at-fault; and 2) whether State Farmâ€™s and the Facilityâ€™s use of the facility rate was authorized and its calculation proper.\r\nBackground\r\nBase and Objective Standards Rates\r\nIn 1987, the General Assembly enacted legislation which provided for a two-tier rating system for automobile insurers to use which included a base rate and an objective standards rate.[3]Â  The objective standards rate was 25% higher than the base rate.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-455 (repealed by Act No. 154, Â§ 31 eff. Mar. 1, 1999).Â  An insurerâ€™s base rate was to be charged to all drivers unless the driver met one or more of the criteria or conditions set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-625 (repealed by 1997 Act No. 154, Â§ 31, eff. Mar. 1, 1999).Â  One of the conditions was whether the driver has been at-fault in a prior accident.Â  Section 38-73-455 listed several exceptions to this increase in premiums - one of which was when the other driver involved in an accident was convicted of a moving traffic violation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-455(d).Â  A driver meeting one of the objective standards ofÂ  Â§ 38-73-625 and not falling within an exception in Â§ 38-73-455 was to be charged the objective standards rate.Â  Furthermore, both the base and objective standards rates were subject to additional surcharges under the Uniform Merit Rating Plan.\r\nUniform Merit Rating Plan \r\nThe Uniform Merit Rating Plan was established in 1976 by regulation to create a uniform system of automobile insurance discounts and surcharges based primarily on a driverâ€™s record. Â S.C. Code Reg. 69-13.1 (repealed by State Reg. Vol. 25, Issue No. 3, eff. Mar. 23, 2001). Â The regulation applied to all insurers writing automobile policies in South Carolina. Surcharge points were assessed based upon moving traffic violation convictions, accidents, and other indicators for the 36-month period prior to the inception of the policy.Â  If there were no surcharge points, the driver was entitled to receive a 20% safe-driverâ€™s discount.Â  One surcharge point, and the driver lost the safe driver discount.Â  Two or more surcharge points increased the premium.Â  If the policy was ceded (or reinsured) to the Facility and without a safe driver discount, the facility rate applied.Â  \r\nThere were also recoupment fees assessed against every policyholder which allowed the Facility to recoup its operating losses.Â  The recoupment fee is calculated based upon the number of surcharge points the driver has under the Merit Rating Plan.Â  See infra n.1.\r\nThe Facility Rate \r\nS.C. Code Ann. 38-73-1420 (2002) provides for the calculation of the facility rate.Â  The facility rate is calculated by the Facility using two numbers: the expense and pure loss components.Â  The pure loss component is derived from the pure loss component which was filed by the rating organization with the most subscribers or members.Â  The expense component is derived from a filing made by the Facility based upon the expense data of its designated carriers.Â Â  After the rating organization with the largest number of members files its pure loss component, and it has been approved, then the Facility files its expense component, the actual incurred expenses of the Facility.Â  Once the expense component is approved by the Director of the Insurance Department, the two are added together to form the facility rate to be used by all designated carriers.Â Â  Â \r\n ISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1)\r\n        Did the circuit court err in granting the Facilityâ€™s\r\n          motion to dismiss?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2)&nbsp;\r\n        Did the circuit court err in denying in part and granting in part State Farmâ€™s motion to dismiss?Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n DISCUSSION\r\nInitially, we address the plaintiffsâ€™ argument that State Farmâ€™s cross-appeal should be dismissed because a denial of a motion to dismiss is not immediately appealable.Â  While State Farm concedes this point, it contends the Court has jurisdiction over its cross-appeal because of judicial economy.Â  We agree. \r\nAn order that is not directly appealable may be considered if there is an appealable issue before the court.Â  Briggs v. Richardson, 273 S.C. 376, 256 S.E.2d 544 (1979); Cox v. Woodmen of World Ins. Co.,Â  347 S.C. 460, 469, 556 S.E.2d 397, 402 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Here, an order in this case which is appealable is before the Court and, in an effort to avoid another appeal in the future and potentially narrow the issues for trial (i.e. judicial economy), we will consider State Farmâ€™s cross-appeal.Â  \r\nIn addressing the issues raised in this case, a threshold decision we must make is whether to adopt the filed rate doctrine.Â  The filed rate doctrine was originally a federal preemption rule which provided that rates duly adopted by a regulatory agency are not subject to collateral attack in court.Â  See Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi, 487 U.S. 354 (1988).Â  See also Hamm v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 310 S.C. 13, 17, 425 S.E.2d 28, 30 (1993). Â â€œThe filed rate doctrine stands for the proposition that because an administrative agency is vested with the authority to determine what rate is just and reasonable, courts should not adjudicate what a reasonable rate might be in a collateral lawsuit.&quot;Â  Amundson &amp; Assocs. Art Studio v. Nat'l Council on Comp. Ins., 988 P.2d 1208, 1213 (Kan. Ct. App. 1999).Â  Many courts have held the rationale underlying the federal filed rate doctrine applies equally to regulations by state agencies.Â  See e.g. Wegoland, Ltd. v. NYNEX Corp., 27 F.3d 17, 20 (2nd Cir. 1994). Â The filed rate doctrine bars only collateral attacks brought by private parties and not direct reviews in ratemaking cases or actions brought by a governmental agency.Â  Commonwealth v. Anthem Ins. Cos., Inc., 8 S.W.3d 48, 53-4 (Ky. Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nMost courts have held the doctrine bars all actions brought by a private party. Â These courts reason that making a declaratory judgment or establishing and enforcing an injunction would inevitably require the court to determine the proper rate â€œto the same, if not greater, extent as would an attempt to fix damages based upon previously filed rates.â€ Hilling v. Northern States Power Co.,Â  1990 WL 597044, *3 (D.Minn. 1990). Â See also Â H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 954 F.2d 485, 490 (8th Cir. 1992)(holding filed rate doctrine to be arguably inapplicable if the claim does not attack the amount of the rate filed, and does not require the court to &quot;second guess&quot; the rate-making agency); Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Alabama Power Co., 824 F.2d 1465, 1472 (5th Cir. 1987)(holding cause of action for fraudulent inducement is not barred by filed rate doctrine if it &quot;would not interfere with the federal agency's rate-making powers&quot;); Litton Sys., Inc. v. AT&amp;T, 700 F.2d 785, 820 (2d Cir. 1983)(holding filed rate doctrine is inapplicable where court is not called upon to even indirectly determine what reasonable rate would have been); Wegoland, Ltd. v. NYNEX Corp., 806 F.Supp. 1112, 1116 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (holding filed rate doctrine is &quot;arguably inapplicable&quot; in cases where courts are not asked to determine what reasonable rate should be); City of Kirkwood v. Union Elec. Co., 671 F.2d 1173, 1179 (E.D. Mo. 1982)(holding filed rate doctrine does not bar award of antitrust damages where plaintiffs did not challenge reasonableness of rates, but rather their anti-competitive effect).Â  \r\nSome jurisdictions have recognized that certain circumstances preclude the application of the filed rate doctrine. See e.g. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. v. Alexander, 818 So.2d 1073 (Miss. 2001)(holding claims for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud were not barred by filed rate doctrine because these causes of action are founded in the common law). Â \r\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions have specifically applied the filed rate doctrine to ratemaking in the insurance industry.Â  See e.g. Horwitz v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 745 N.E.2d 591 (Ill. App. 2001); . Amundson, 988 P.2d 1208; Am. Bankers' Ins.\r\nv. Wells, 819 So.2d 1196 Miss. 2001); Byan v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 662 N.Y.S.2d 44 (N.Y. 1997); North Carolina Steel, Inc. v. Nat'l Council on Comp. Ins., 496 S.E.2d 369 (N.C. 1998); Prentice v. Title Ins. Co. of Minn., 500 N.W.2d 658 (Wis. 1993).Â  However, at least one other state has refused to expand the filed rate doctrine to insurance situations. See e.g. Mitchell v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 2004 WL 2137815, *2 (Minn.Dist.Ct. 2004) (specifically declining to expand the filed rate doctrine to include the insurance industry).Â  \r\nCourts which have adopted the filed rate doctrine have given several reasons for doing so, including: (1) preserving the agency's authority to determine the reasonableness of rates; (2) recognizing the agencyâ€™s expertise with regard to that industry, whereas courts do not; (3) allowing an action would undermine the regulatory scheme because the statute allows for enforcement by the appropriate state officers; and (4) allowing an action may result in different prices being paid by victorious plaintiffs than non-suing ratepayers, which violates the statutory scheme of uniform rates.Â  See e.g. Wegoland Ltd., 27 F.3d 17 at 21-22.\r\nWe find the policy reasons behind the filed rate doctrine persuasive.Â  The filed rate doctrine preserves the stability, uniformity, and finality inherent in rates filed with the regulatory agency and what has been determined to be a reasonable rate by that agency.Â  Cullum v. Seagull Mid-South, Inc., 907 S.W.2d 741, 745 (Ark. 1995).Â  Accordingly, we hereby adopt the filed rate doctrine and, furthermore, we find it applicable in the insurance industry.Â  Although not applicable in the present case, we also recognize there are several exceptions as set out above which may prevent its application.Â  \r\nWe now turn to the causes of action alleged in the present case. Â In the 1st cause of action, which applies only to State Farm, the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that insurers must determine the disposition of a traffic citation to the other driver before assigning their insureds a chargeable accident.Â  This cause of action is not the subject of any issue on appeal and thus remains viable.[4]\r\nIn the 2nd cause of action and part of the 7th cause of action, the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that an insurer cannot raise recoupment fees based upon the assessment of surcharge points without a judicial determination of fault.Â  Specifically, the plaintiffs allege State Farm violated Â§ 38-77-625 when it raised the plaintiffsâ€™ recoupment fees without a judicial determination that they were at-fault in their accidents.Â  The trial judge dismissed the 2nd cause of action and corresponding parts of the 7th cause of action finding an insurance company does not need to have a judicial determination of fault prior to increasing recoupment fees.Â  \r\nSection 38-77-625 provides:Â  â€œIf an insured is involved in a motor vehicle accident where he is not the at-fault driver, his facility recoupment charge may not be increased by his insurer because of this occurrence.â€ The parties agree that an insured must be at-fault for there to be an increase in his recoupment fees.Â  However, the issue is how fault is to be determined.Â  \r\nThe plaintiffs contend a judicial determination of fault is always required.Â  State Farm, however, argues the statute should not be read to always require a judicial determination of fault.[5] Â We agree. Words used in a statute should be given their plain ordinary meaning. Â First Baptist Church v. City of Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 417 S.E.2d 592 (1992). Â It is not reasonable to read this statute as requiring a judicial determination of fault. The plain language of the statute does not require a judicial determination of fault and to require one would unnecessarily burden the courts and result in more litigation. Â Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the 2nd cause of action and parts of the 7th cause of action to the extent they are predicated on the 2nd cause of action.\r\nIn the 5th cause of action, the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the Facility illegally calculated the facility rate and State Farm collected it without authority.[6] Â The trial judge dismissed this cause of action against the Facility finding it barred by the filed rate doctrine.Â  However, in his order partially denying State Farmâ€™s motion to dismiss, the trial judge stated the filed rate doctrine had not been adopted in South Carolina and he refused to dismiss these causes of action against State Farm.\r\nHaving now adopted the filed rate doctrine, however, we find it bars this cause of action against both the Facility and State Farm. Â The filed rate doctrine bars any causes of actions which necessarily require a court to determine a reasonable rate.Â  American Bankers' Ins. Co., 819 So.2d at 1213 (holding claims requiring the court to determine what a reasonable rate would have been improperly require a court to â€œsecond guessâ€ the regulating agency). Â This cause of action would clearly require us to determine a reasonable facility rate.[7]Â  \r\nAdditionally, we note it was the Facility which calculated and set the facility rate. State Farm was not involved in calculating and setting the facility rate and was, in fact, required to use and collect the approved facility rate. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-920 (2002)(no insurance may be issued except approved filed rates).\r\n&nbsp;Further, we note that contrary to the plaintiffsâ€™ assertion, South Carolina insureds are not without a remedy.Â  South Carolina insureds can challenge approved rates pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 338-73-1030 (2002). Â This section specificallyÂ  provides: â€œAny person or organization aggrieved with respect to any filing which is in effect may make written application to the director or his designee for a hearing thereon . . . â€Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, State Farmâ€™s motion to dismiss the 5th cause of action should have been granted and thus we reverse the trial judgeâ€™s denial.Â  We also affirm the grant of the Facilityâ€™s motion to dismiss this cause of action.\r\nIn the 8th cause of action, the plaintiffs allege the Facility and State Farm violated various statutes and regulations and seek damages, including punitive damages. This cause of action relies upon the same statutes which are the basis for the declaratory reliefÂ \r\nsought in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action. The trial judge dismissed this action against the Facility in its entirety and against State Farm to the extent it relies upon the 2nd cause of action. Â He denied State Farmâ€™s motion to dismiss the parts of this action which rely upon the 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action.Â \r\nAs stated above, we are reversing the trial judgeâ€™s denial of State Farmâ€™s motion to dismiss the 5th causes of action and the 3rd and 4th causes of action have been abandoned.Â  Accordingly, we also reverse his denial as to the corresponding parts of the 8th cause of action. Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the partial denial of State Farmâ€™s motion to dismiss and affirm the partial grant of State Farmâ€™s motion to dismiss. Â We also affirm the dismissal of all of the claims against the Facility.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART. \r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Brooke P. Goldsmith concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n Chief Justice Toal: I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, this case does not require consideration of the â€œfiled rate doctrineâ€ because this is not a â€œrate case.â€Â  Therefore, I would reverse the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of Plaintiffsâ€™ claims that the South Carolina Reinsurance Facility (the Facility) charged Plaintiffs an illegal â€œfacility base rate,â€ and that State Farm Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) collected this illegal rate.Â  In addition, I would affirm the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to dismiss Plaintiffsâ€™ claims that State Farm issued unauthorized surcharge points on Plaintiffsâ€™ insurance policies, in violation of the partiesâ€™ insurance contracts and South Carolina law.Â \r\nIn my opinion, the majority mischaracterizes this case as a â€œrate case,â€ and as a result, improperly considers the applicability of the â€œfiled rate doctrine.â€Â  Outlined first by Justice Brandeis in Keogh v. Chicago &amp; N. W. RY. CO., 260 U.S. 156, 43 S.Ct. 47 (1922), the â€œfiled rate doctrineâ€ hypothesizes that regulatory rates which are duly adopted via administrative channels and/or administrative proceedings are not subject to collateral attack in court.Â  See also Commâ€™r. ex rel. Chandler v. Anthem Ins. Companies, Inc., 8 S.W.3d 48, 51 (Ky. Ct. App. 1999) (holding that the filed rate doctrine precludes an agencyâ€™s liability for damages).Â  \r\nIn the traditional â€œrate case,â€ a plaintiff would argue that he was charged an excessive premium because an administrative body, through the exercise of its discretion, should have adopted a lower premium.Â  This case stands in stark contrast to such a claim.Â  Plaintiffs in the instant case allege that they were improperly charged the wrong rate, though the rate was otherwise valid.[8]Â  \r\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs allege that State Farm assessed unauthorized surcharge points to Plaintiffsâ€™ insurance policies in violation of the partiesâ€™ insurance contracts.Â  In addition, Plaintiffs allege that these unauthorized surcharge points were assessed in violation of South Carolina law.Â  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the Facility violated S.C. Code Â­Â­Â­Â§Â§ 38-73-1400 and 38-73-1420 when calculating the â€œfacility base rate,â€ and that State Farm collected this illegal rate.Â  \r\nIn my opinion, these causes of action, essentially claims for declaratory relief and damages in the form of overcharges, can be easily resolved by simply implementing the clear and unambiguous terms of the rates outlined in the South Carolina Code.[9]Â  Accordingly, I would allow the Plaintiffsâ€™ above-discussed claims and also decline to address the broader issue of the applicability of the â€œfiled rate doctrineâ€ in South Carolina; the doctrine is simply not implicated in this case.\r\nAs a final matter, the trial judge also held that Plaintiffsâ€™ claim that only certain policy holders could be charged premiums other than the â€œbaseâ€ or â€œobjectiveâ€ rates was predicated on an erroneous reading of the law.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge dismissed this claim against the Facility.Â  Plaintiffs did not argue that this was error on appeal.Â  Since Plaintiffsâ€™ assert an identical claim against State Farm, I would dismiss this claim on the same grounds. \r\nAccordingly, I would reverse in part and affirm in part the ruling of the circuit court.Â  I would allow the case to proceed forward and Plaintiffs to assert (1) that the Facility charged Plaintiffs an illegal â€œfacility base rate,â€ (2) that State Farm collected this illegal rate, and (3) that State Farm issued unauthorized surcharge points on Plaintiffsâ€™ insurance policies, in violation of the partiesâ€™ insurance contracts and South Carolina law.\r\n\r\n[1]The â€œFacility is an unincorporated, nonprofit entity created by statute in 1974 to provide high-risk drivers with automobile insurance not available through the voluntary market.â€Â  Garris v. Governing Bd. of S.C. Reinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 437,Â  511 S.E.2d 48, 50 n.1 (1998). The Facility imposes recoupment charges on all drivers to recover its losses.Â  The amount of the surcharge is based upon the individualâ€™s driving record. Â On March 1, 1999, the Facility stopped accepting new policies and will cease to operate in 2006.Â Â  Id.\r\n[2]We note this action is being brought as a class action, but it has not yet been certified as such.\r\n[3]In 1997, the General Assembly overhauled the automobile insurance system in South Carolina, and many of the statutes involved in this case were repealed - most effective March 1, 1999.\r\n[4]We note the trial judge dismissed the plaintiffsâ€™ 6th cause of action alleging a civil conspiracy against both the facility and State farm.Â  The plaintiffs have not argued this was error.Â  Therefore, any argument as to the dismissal of the 6th cause of action has been abandoned.Â  Video Gaming, Inc., v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 342 S.C. 34, 42, 535 S.E.2d 642, 647 (2000).Â \r\n[5]The real issue is whether State Farm can make a fault determination which conflicts with a judicial determination. As noted above, in the 1st cause of action which remains viable, the plaintiffs are seeking a declaratory judgment that insurers must determine the disposition of a ticket to other driver before assigning their insureds a chargeable accident.\r\n[6]The trial judge dismissed the 3rd and 4th causes of action against the Facility and the plaintiffs did not appeal the dismissal.Â  At oral argument, the plaintiffs also abandoned these causes of action against State Farm.Â Â  Â Â \r\n[7]Contrary to the dissentâ€™s assertions, this case cannot be easily resolved by implementing clear and unambiguous statutes.Â  Resolving this case would necessarily require a court to determine what the proper facility rate should be - which the filed rate doctrine specifically precludes.Â  Furthermore, the dissentâ€™s hypothetical discussing a â€œwrong rateâ€ being applied in footnote 1 is inapplicable in this case.Â  The only cause of\r\naction in whichÂ  the plaintiffs are alleging they were charged the â€œwrong rateâ€ is the 1st cause of action - which is not the subject of this appeal.Â  \r\n[8] To distinguish this case from a â€œrate case,â€ it is perhaps helpful to use the following illustration:Â  If Plaintiff claims, â€œin the exercise of discretion, the agency should have adopted some lower rate instead of a rate of X,â€ then Plaintiff is effectively asking the court to substitute its discretion for the administrative agencyâ€™s.Â  If instead, a rate scheme authorizes a base rate of X, and further provides that, if certain additional conditions exist, then a rate of Y, Plaintiff is free to argue that he does not meet the requirements for issuance of the higher rate; Plaintiff is merely disputing the rateâ€™s validity â€œas appliedâ€ to him.\r\n[9] I simply fail to see how performing the mathematical computations of (1) subtracting unauthorized surcharge points from Plaintiffsâ€™ insurance policies (Plaintiffsâ€™ seventh and eighth causes of action) and (2) correctly applying non-discretionary portions of the statutory rate (Plaintiffsâ€™ fifth cause of action) constitutes supplanting the Department of Insuranceâ€™s discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Comment 4 to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2005-12-02-01","description":"This order amends Comment [4] to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.","date":"2005-12-05","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South\r\nCarolina\r\nIn re: Comment 4 to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of \r\nProfessional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\nPursuant to Article V, Â§ 4, of the South Carolina Constitution, we amend Comment [4] to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, by deleting the final sentence of the comment which states a prosecutor is required to obtain court approval for the issuance of lawyer subpoenas in grand jury and other criminal proceedings after an opportunity for an adversarial hearing is afforded.\r\nComment [4] to Rule 3.8 shall now read as follows:\r\n\r\n[4]Â Â Â Â  Paragraph (e) is intended to limit the issuance of lawyer subpoenas in grand jury and other criminal proceedings to those situations in which there is a genuine need to intrude into the client-lawyer relationship.\r\n\r\nThis amendment shall become effective immediately.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Susan M. Johnston, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nO. Allen Alexander, of Columbia, pro se. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to either a definite suspension not to exceed two years or an indefinite suspension.Â  We accept the Agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows. \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn October 2003, a client retained respondent to initiate post-divorce litigation.Â  The client advised respondent that her ex-husband travels frequently out of the country and she made respondent aware of his travel schedule.Â  The client expressed concern regarding her ex-husbandâ€™s instability and her own safety.Â  Despite apparent opportunities, the clientâ€™s ex-husband had not been served at the time the client filed her complaint on July 28, 2004.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nIn February 2004, respondent ordered a transcript from a court reporter.Â  The court reporter sent respondent more than ten statements requesting payment.Â  As of the date of the Agreement, respondent had not paid the court reporter.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nClients retained respondent to assist with a property damage claim on their automobile.Â  Respondent accepted the settlement check on the condition he would send the insurance company title to the automobile.Â  Respondent disbursed the monies but never sent the title.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent was retained to proceed in a collection matter.Â  Respondent accepted approximately $1,125.00 in fees and costs and then ignored all inquires by the client and has not completed his services to the client.Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nA couple retained respondent to represent them in regard to a non-disclosure issue in a real estate transaction.Â  Respondent accepted a retainer of approximately $2,030.00 but failed to complete the services and subsequently refused all contact with the couple.Â  The couple filed a claim with the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board which awarded them $1,530.00.Â  Respondent failed to refund the unearned fee as awarded.\r\nMatter VI\r\nA circuit court judge reported respondent had failed to appear in his court for several matters even though he had been scheduled and notified to appear.Â  Respondentâ€™s failures to appear were to the detriment of his clients.Â  All of the judgeâ€™s attempts to contact respondent about his failure to appear were unsuccessful.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent has fully cooperated with ODC in connection with these matters.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation);

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex Davis, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nCraig J. Poff, of Beaufort, pro se.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of an admonition, public reprimand, or definite suspension not to exceed sixty (60) days.Â  We accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for a sixty (60) day period.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn or about May 2003, the complainant obtained a home equity line of credit from Navy Federal Credit Union (Navy Federal).Â  She was told by Navy Federal that Don Young would be the closing attorney.Â  Don Young is the owner of American Title &amp; Abstract; he is not a licensed attorney. \r\nRespondent represents that, on the morning of May 12, 2003, a member of Mr. Youngâ€™s office contacted him and asked if he could handle a closing in the afternoon.Â  Respondent agreed to handle the closing.Â  Respondent did not attend the closing; he represents he was unable to attend the closing at the scheduled time because he was in court on an unrelated matter.Â  \r\nBecause he was unable to attend the closing, respondent telephoned a staff member at American Title &amp; Abstract, where the closing was to occur, and requested that the complainant postpone the closing until he could arrive.Â  When the complainant indicated she did not want any delay, respondent instructed the staff member to let the complainant execute the closing documents and leave them for him to review.Â  Respondent never spoke with the complainant prior to executing the closing documents; he was not present at the closing itself; and respondent did not speak with the complainant after the closing.Â  \r\nRespondent represents he arrived at American Title &amp; Abstract the following morning and, for the first time, reviewed the closing documents. Â Respondent asserts he spoke with a staff member at American Title &amp; Abstract who stated that she had been present when the complainant executed the closing documents. The staff member provided respondent with the mortgage which the complainant had signed at the closing the day before.Â  On page seven of the mortgage, the staff member verified to respondent that her own signature appeared on the line designated as Witness #1 and that she had personally observed the complainant execute the mortgage.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he affixed his signature on the line designated as Witness #2 even though he had not been present for the closing and had not personally witnessed the complainant execute the mortgage.Â  On page eight of the mortgage, respondent notarized the staff memberâ€™s statement that she, along with the other witness delineated on page seven (i.e., respondent), had witnessed the execution of the mortgage.Â  Respondent admits this was a false statement as he was not personally present at the time the complainant executed the mortgage.Â  He further admits he allowed the staff member to falsely swear before him as a Notary Public.Â  \r\nRespondent admits that, after reviewing the mortgage and settlement statement, he returned all original documents to Navy Federal pursuant to Navy Federalâ€™s instructions.Â  Respondent represents he did not file the mortgage as this was not within the scope of his representation when contacted to handle the closing by American Title &amp; Abstract.Â  Respondent admits he assisted American Title &amp; Abstract and Navy Federal in engaging in the unauthorized practice of law and that he participated in a real estate closing in clear violation of this Courtâ€™s precedent. \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.2 (when lawyer knows client expects assistance not permitted by Rules of Professional Conduct, lawyer shall consult with client regarding relevant limitations on lawyerâ€™s conduct); Rule 5.5(b) (lawyer shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice).[1] Â In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for a sixty (60) day period.[2]Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  MOORE, J., not\r\nparticipating.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n[2] In the event the Court suspended respondent, the parties agreed to the appointment of an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests.Â  By separate order, the Court will appoint an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26086","title":"Grosshuesch v.

Lynn Lofton, both of Lofton &amp; Lofton, of Charleston; G. Wells Dickson, Jr., of Charleston; and M. Duane Shuler, of Kingstree, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Bernard and Eleanor Breedlove (the Breedloves) appeal the trial courtâ€™s decision denying their request for a preliminary injunction.Â  This case was certified from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual /Procedural Background\r\nThe Breedloves are elderly individuals with substantial assets.Â  In the mid to late 1990â€™s, the Breedloves became acquainted with Lisa Cramer, an employee in the Personal Trust division of one of the Breedlovesâ€™ banking institutions.Â  Over time, Lisa Cramer became an individual in whom Eleanor Breedlove placed a considerable amount of trust and confidence.Â  Specifically, Lisa Cramer left the bank and became the Breedlovesâ€™ primary caregiver; providing housekeeping services and assisting the Breedloves in handling much of their day to day affairs.Â  Additionally, Lisa Cramer became a trustee assisting in the management of different trusts in which the Breedloves had considerable assets.\r\nBeginning as early as 2001, the Breedloves began to transfer substantial assets to Lisa and her husband, Nathan Cramer (the Cramers).Â  As of June of 2004, the Breedloves had transferred various tracts of real estate worth over $2.1 million and liquid assets worth over $3.5 million.Â  These transfers were effectuated by checks made payable to â€œCashâ€ drawn on the Breedlovesâ€™ account, payments directly to Lisa Cramer, or checks written by the Breedloves to pay the Cramersâ€™ credit card bills or other expenses.Â  \r\nDuring the time of these transfers, the Breedloves were both suffering from some degree of dementia related to their advanced age.[1]Â  Gradually, several people with whom the Breedloves dealt became suspicious that Lisa Cramer was taking advantage of the Breedlovesâ€™ trust and confidence.Â  After being alerted to an ongoing elder abuse and exploitation investigation conducted by one of the Breedlovesâ€™ banking institutions, the Beaufort County Sheriffâ€™s Office arrested the Cramers.Â  Lisa Cramer is currently under indictment in Beaufort County for violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-35-10(3)(b) (Supp. 2004) (â€œFinancial Exploitation of a Vulnerable Adultâ€) and Â§ 16-17-410 (â€œConspiracyâ€).Â  Nathan Cramer is under indictment for violation of Â§ 16-17-410 (â€œConspiracyâ€).Â  \r\nThe Breedloves instituted a civil action seeking to set aside these transfers on the grounds of fraud and undue influence.Â  At the outset of the case, the Breedloves sought to prevent the respondents from transferring or otherwise disposing of the assets at issue.[2]Â  To achieve this result, the Breedloves filed lis pendens against the subject real estate, and sought a preliminary injunction preventing the respondents from exercising control over any of the subject assets and ordering an accounting for all funds transferred to the Cramers from the Breedloves.[3]Â  Throughout this litigation, the Cramers have maintained that these transfers were gifts from the Breedloves.\r\nThe trial court denied the Breedlovesâ€™ request for an injunction.Â  The court found that although the Breedloves had shown irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits, the Breedloves failed to show the absence of an adequate remedy at law.Â  The trial court read this Courtâ€™s decision in Scratch Golf Co. v. Dunes West Residential Golf Properties, Inc., et al., to require the Breedloves to seek relief through the statutory remedy of attachment.Â  361 S.C. 117, 603 S.E.2d 905 (2004).Â  The Breedloves now raise the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in denying the Breedloveâ€™s request for a preliminary injunction because attachment was an adequate remedy at law?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nActions for injunctive relief are equitable in nature.Â  Wiedemann v. Town of Hilton Head, 344 S.C. 233, 236, 542 S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App. 2001). Â In equitable actions, the appellate court may review the record and make findings of fact in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 276, 457 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1995).Â  To obtain an injunction, a party must demonstrate irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, and the absence of an adequate remedy at law.Â  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 669, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nI. Adequate Remedy at Law\r\nBecause the trial court based its refusal to issue an injunction on the existence of an adequate remedy at law, we will address this issue first.Â  The trial court found this courtâ€™s Scratch Golf decision to require the Breedloves to use attachment to preserve the disputed assets until the disposition of the case.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Scratch Golf, a golf course sued a developer alleging breach of contract and negligence in designing the golf courseâ€™s irrigation system.Â  361 S.C. at 120, 603 S.E.2d at 907.Â  The golf course moved for a preliminary injunction freezing the developerâ€™s assets so there would be a pool of assets out of which any judgment for the golf course could be satisfied.Â  Id. Â The trial court granted the golf courseâ€™s request and ordered a large amount of money put in escrow.Â  Id.Â  \r\n This Court reversed, finding that the golf courseâ€™s arguments in favor of an injunction were really justifications for the statutory remedy of attachment.Â  Id. at 122, 603 S.E.2d at 908.Â  The golf course argued for an injunction on the grounds that the golf course would suffer irreparable harm having no adequate legal remedy to recover the potential judgment against the developer because the developer would move its assets elsewhere.Â  Id. Â The Court drew guidance from the attachment statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-19-10 (2003), and case law, and concluded that attachment was the proper remedy when seeking to freeze anotherâ€™s assets for the purpose of satisfying a potential judgment.Â  Scratch Golf, 361 S.C. at 122-23, 603 S.E.2d at 908.Â  \r\nThe trial court incorrectly applied Scratch Golf to the instant case.Â  Scratch Golf was an action at law, and the attachment issue dealt only with preserving anotherâ€™s assets for satisfaction of a potential judgment.Â  This case is an equitable action in which the assets sought to be preserved, specifically $2 million worth of accounts, monies, and personal property, are the subject of the instant dispute.Â  As distinguished from attachment, by which the court takes jurisdiction over the defendantâ€™s property â€œas a security for such judgment as a plaintiff may recover,â€ Â§ 15-19-10, this case involves the quintessential hallmark of an injunction: preservation of the property at issue until the matter has been adjudicated.\r\nAt least two significant obstacles would exist if the Breedloves pursued attachment in an effort to freeze the disputed assets.Â  First, the record reveals that approximately $1.4 million has been removed from the Cramersâ€™ Merrill Lynch account since their arrest and transferred to an unknown location.Â  Because attachment is effectuated by taking control of the defendantâ€™s property, and the location of the disputed property is not known, there is no way that any cash removed from the account or any personal property purchased with the money could be attached.[4]\r\nMore significantly, attachment would be inappropriate in this case because ownership of the property has not been established.Â  Section 15-19-10 provides that attachment is a process by which the property of the defendant is brought under the courtâ€™s jurisdiction.Â  Because this lawsuitâ€™s central issue is ownership of the disputed property, attachment would be entirely inappropriate in these circumstances.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in applying the reasoning of Scratch Golf to this case, and we find that the Breedloves lack an adequate remedy at law to preserve the $2 million and any assets purchased therewith until this lawsuit has been resolved.\r\nII. Likelihood of Success on the Merits &amp; Irreparable Harm\r\n The trial court found that the Breedloves had shown a likelihood of success on the merits and that they would suffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction was not issued.Â  We agree and adopt the reasoning set forth in the trial courtâ€™s order as to these issues.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court and issue a preliminary injunction freezing the Cramersâ€™ Merrill Lynch account and any other accounts, assets, and personal property purchased or acquired with the $2 million obtained from the Breedloves.Â  This matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to proceed consistent with this opinion.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice William P. Keesley, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Beaufort County Probate Court appointed An L. Grosshuesch as guardian and conservator for the Breedloves after the Breedloves commenced this lawsuit.Â  \r\n[2] The respondents Lawrence H. Gray, Duane Marie Gray, and Sweetgrass Land Company, L.L.C., are alleged to be in possession of assets wrongfully taken by the Cramers, or are alleged to have wrongfully utilized the Breedlovesâ€™ assets for their own benefit.\r\n[3] The Breedloves are specifically concerned about a Merrill Lynch account which initially contained $2 million.Â  Since the time of the Cramersâ€™ arrest, approximately $1.4 million has been removed and transferred to an unknown location.Â  \r\n[4] The Cramers have continually refused to reveal the location of any of the disputed assets.Â  At the hearing on the preliminary injunction, Lisa Cramerâ€™s attorney stipulated that if Lisa were called to the stand, she would assert her rights under the Fifth Amendment as to the location of any of these assets.Â  Since possession of the assets is not at issue in either of the Cramerâ€™s pending legal matters, we do not view the Fifth Amendment as an impediment to the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26081","title":"In the Matter of Eric B.

McMillian, III, for the closing of real estate transactions. Respondent sought to be a closing attorney for CTS, but Cook only needed a lawyer to fill in for McMillian at closings when he was unavailable.Â  After seeking and obtaining Chicago Titleâ€™s approval and speaking with McMillian by telephone, respondent agreed to the arrangement. \r\nRespondent represents that, during her telephone conversation with McMillian, he assured her that, other than attending the actual closing, he would be supervising all aspects of the transactions.[2]Â  Respondent never met McMillian and did not communicate with him again until after terminating her relationship with CTS.Â  \r\nFrom February through April 2002, respondent attended approximately twenty-four real estate closings.Â  Respondent was asked only to attend the closings and be responsible for the review and execution of the closing documents.Â  Respondent represents she was under the good faith impression that McMillan would attend to or supervise all other aspects of the real estate transactions; however, McMillian did not do so and it is now known that he took no part in these transactions.\r\nThe closings took places at CTSâ€™ offices.Â  Respondent received all files and instructions from Cook or her employees and, after the closing, she left all closing documents and monies with Cook or her employees.Â  Most of the closings at issue were relatively uncomplicated.Â  On the few occasions when a question or problem arose, respondent stopped the closing and Cook rescheduled it for a later date.Â  Respondent is now advised and does not dispute that the title abstracts and closing documents were prepared by Cook and CTS employees without the supervision of any lawyer, that disbursement of funds and recordation of documents were handled by Cook and CTS employees without the supervision of any lawyer, and that McMillianâ€™s only involvement in the transactions consisted of allowing Cook unlimited and unsupervised use of his trust accounts.[3]Â  \r\nRespondent represents she verbally informed the parties to each closing that her role was limited to explaining and executing the documents and that CTS and its lawyer were responsible for all other aspects of the closing.Â  However, on several occasions, respondent supervised the buyerâ€™s execution of an attorney preference form during which buyers selected respondent to represent them in all aspects of the transaction. [4] Â On these occasions, respondent filled in her own name as the selected attorney on the form prior to its execution by the buyer.Â  \r\nOn thirteen occasions, the HUD-1 Settlement Statements included a $12 wire fee payable to respondent even though respondent never incurred a wire fee in any transaction with CTS.Â  ODC is informed and believes that, in each of these closings, a wire fee was incurred by CTS or McMillianâ€™s trust account under Cookâ€™s control.Â  Because respondent had requested Cook increase her fee, Cook offered to give respondent the $12 wire fee as a way to increase her fee without turning away clients who might object to an overt fee increase.Â  Respondent consented to this arrangement.Â  Respondent now recognizes that the HUD-1 statement was not completely accurate and that the arrangement resulted in respondent receiving a portion of her fee from someone other than her client.Â  \r\nOn one occasion, respondent closed a transaction in which the buyers were personal friends of Cook.Â  Cook had agreed not to charge the buyers an attorney fee and the HUD-1 Settlement Statement reflected no fee to any lawyer.Â  However, Cook and respondent agreed that Cook would pay respondent a fee outside the closing and not disclose the fee to anyone. Â Respondent now recognizes that closing the transaction in this manner and accepting an undisclosed fee violated the Rules of Professional Conduct and federal law.Â  \r\nIn most of the transactions respondent closed, respondentâ€™s name or her firm name were shown on the HUD-1 as â€œSettlement Agent,â€ but respondent did not act as settlement agent as she neither held nor disbursed the closing proceeds.Â  Due to her inexperience, respondent was not aware of all the implications made by the statements on the HUD-1 form.Â  Respondent now recognizes that, by forwarding inaccurate HUD-1 forms to clients and other parties, she misrepresented her role to all parties relying on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements, particularly lenders who were not present at the closings.Â  Her misrepresentation is most pronounced in those closings in which the HUD-1 Settlement Statements indicated that respondent incurred a wire fee, as the statements implied to lenders and subsequent assignees that respondent was disbursing the loan proceeds, including making payoffs of prior mortgages and liens.\r\nOn two occasions, a lender delivered closing funds to respondentâ€™s trust account rather than to McMillianâ€™s trust account for transactions in which respondent was to act as closing attorney for CTS.Â  Respondent endorsed the first check to CTS based on information from Cook that the lender wanted Cook to disburse the money.Â  The second check was a wire transfer into respondentâ€™s trust account which respondent initially refused to endorse to Cook but, when a CTS employee refused to give respondent a disbursement summary, respondent relented and wrote a trust account check to CTS for the funds so that the transaction could close without the borrower losing a favorable interest rate.Â  \r\nOn one occasion, a buyer brought funds to the closing in the form of a check payable to respondent.Â  Due to a title issue, the closing was delayed until a time when respondent would not be available.Â  As a result, respondent endorsed the buyerâ€™s check to CTS and gave it to Cook.Â  Respondent now recognizes she should not have given the client funds to a non-lawyer.Â Â  Â Â \r\nOn two occasions, respondent signed a loan confirmation or â€œFirst Lien Letterâ€ several days after closing.Â  These letters advised the lender and title insurance company that the transaction was closed and completely disbursed, that all prior liens were satisfied, and that the lenderâ€™s mortgage was a valid first lien on the property.Â  Respondent represents she believed those statements were true but admits that such a belief was merely an assumption, that she had no actual knowledge of the truth or falsity of the statements, and that she did not verify the information with anyone outside of CTS before executing the letters. Â \r\nIt is now known that in most, if not all, of the transactions closed by respondent for CTS, Cook diverted closing proceeds from McMillianâ€™s trust accounts to her personal accounts and did not disburse money to the parties as indicated on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements.Â  Respondent had no knowledge of this activity at the time. \r\nSince 2002, Chicago Title and its counsel have worked to correct the title problems caused by Cookâ€™s defalcation in transactions involving respondent and other lawyers.Â  Chicago Title has spent approximately $250,000 to resolve title issues in closings in which respondent was involved.Â  In addition, several holders of unpaid prior mortgages compromised their debts in settling with Chicago Title and, therefore, remain financially prejudiced; Chicago Title denied coverage in several other cases, leaving the holders of those unpaid prior liens and mortgages with no recourse but foreclosure. Â Respondent has resolved through settlement each lawsuit in which she was a named defendant.Â  \r\nIn addition to the transactions in which respondent served as closing attorney, on numerous occasions respondent received checks written on McMillianâ€™s trust account and signed by Cook as payment of attorney fees for closing in which respondent had no involvement.Â  In at least three of these transactions, Cook had used respondentâ€™s name as the settlement agent on closing documents but, as with other transactions, Cook had stolen the lenderâ€™s money and did not make the disbursements as indicated in the HUD-1 Settlement Statements.Â  Respondent had no knowledge of these transactions or of Cookâ€™s defalcations until being so advised by ODC.Â  Nevertheless, respondent and her staff deposited these fee checks into respondentâ€™s operating account, incorrectly assuming that they related to transactions in which she had served as closing attorney.Â  Respondent maintained no office procedure for matching incoming payments to closing work performed and, therefore, unwittingly received payments for the use of her name and law license by a non-lawyer.Â  \r\nOn three occasions in March 2002, a lender wired closing funds totaling $197, 285.99 to respondentâ€™s trust account.Â  Respondent closed two of those transactions, not knowing funds were wired to her account, but assuming they were wired to McMillianâ€™s account as usual.Â  Cook closed the third transaction without respondentâ€™s knowledge.Â  In all three of the transactions, the funds were not disbursed as indicated in the HUD-1 Settlement Statements.Â  Respondent attempted to reconcile her trust account on a monthly basis, but her reconciliations did not alert her to the excess funds in her trust account. \r\nSeveral months after respondent terminated her relationship with CTS she sought an agency relationship with Stewart Title Company pursuant to which Stewart Title conducted an audit of respondentâ€™s trust account.Â  The audit alerted respondent to the excess funds in July 2002 and respondent immediately took steps that resulted in delivery of those funds to the appropriate parties.Â  Until the audit, respondent had no knowledge of the three wires into her trust account.Â  Respondent now recognizes that, in order to comply with Rule 417, SCACR, on a monthly basis she must reconcile the trust account balance according to the bankâ€™s records with the balance according to her records of account activity and that, if she had complied with Rule 417, she would have been immediately alerted to the improper deposits.Â  \r\nAfter closing approximately two dozen transactions between February and April 2002, respondent became aware that Cook or a CTS employee had forged her name on a HUD-1 Settlement Statement and on a closing proceeds check from a lender and that checks written by CTS were being dishonored for insufficient funds.Â  Upon learning this information, respondent severed her relationship with CTS.Â  Respondent then sent a letter to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission) purporting to be an anonymous report of Cookâ€™s and McMillianâ€™s actions.Â  The letter sought the advice of the Commission and offered respondentâ€™s assistance in stopping the ongoing defalcation.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn mitigation, respondent states she was under the good faith impression that McMillian was performing or supervising all aspects of the real estate transaction that required attorney participation.Â  She further states she was unaware that Cook was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, that she was unaware that Cook had unsupervised access to and use of McMillianâ€™s trust accounts, and that she in no way intentionally contributed to the defalcations in these transactions.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by her misconduct, she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.4(b) (lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation); Rule 1.8(f) (lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless the client consents after consultation); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safe keep client funds); Rule 4.1(a) (in course of representing a client, lawyer shall not make a false statement of material fact to a third person); Rule 5.5(b) (lawyer shall not assist a person in the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).[5]Â  Respondent acknowledges that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).

Ronald McMahan, both of Moore, Taylor &amp; Thomas, PA, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This is an action for partition of real property, brought on behalf of Ernest J. Smith, Sr. (Respondent) against his wife Joanne Rucker Smith (Petitioner).Â  The court of appeals held that Petitioner and Respondent owned the property as joint tenants with a right of survivorship and that the property was subject to partition.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nOn August 17, 2000, Petitioner deeded a share in a parcel of land to her husband, Respondent.Â  The deed, executed shortly after their marriage, granted Respondent an undivided one-half interest in the property.[1]Â  The deed granted the property to Petitioner and Respondent â€œfor and during their joint lives and upon the death of either of them, then to the survivor of them, his or her heirs and assigns forever in fee simple . . . .â€Â  Identical language was used in the deedâ€™s habendum clause.\r\nDue to conflict between the families, Respondentâ€™s family instituted an action for partition.Â  Respondent became incapacitated and Respondentâ€™s son, acting on behalf of Respondent, brought the partition action.Â  At the time the action was instituted, Petitioner and Respondent were married and no act, such as filing for divorce, inconsistent with the intent to remain married had been taken.Â  A successful partition action would result in a forced sale of the property which had been Petitionerâ€™s home since 1958.Â  \r\nThe case was referred to the master-in-equity.Â  Respondent moved for summary judgment and the motion was granted.Â  In granting summary judgment, the master found that the deed conveyed the shared interest to the parties as joint tenants with a right of survivorship.Â  As a result, the master relied on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-10 (2005) to find that the property was subject to partition.[2]Â  The court of appeals affirmed the masterâ€™s decision, holding that the deed conveyed the property to the parties as joint tenants with the right of survivorship and that the estate was subject to partition.Â  Petitioner appealed.Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the following issue:\r\n\r\nDid the deed convey the shared interest in the estate to the parties as tenants in common with a right of survivorship, which is an estate that is not subject to partition?\r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues that the deed at issue creates a tenancy in common with an indestructible right of survivorship.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough joint tenancies were favored in early common law, they have fallen into disfavor.Â  See Harold W. Jacobs, Note, Cotenancies, Estates of in South Carolina, 11 S.C.L.Q. 520, 521-535 (1959) (explaining the movement away from construing deeds in favor of granting joint tenancies).Â  In South Carolina, documents conveying a shared interest in property have generally been construed in favor of tenancies in common.Â  Herbemont v. Thomas, 15 Chev. Eq. 21 (S.C. 1839).Â  Courts began favoring tenancies in common over joint tenancies because the harsh results of survivorship rights often encumbered the land and defeated the intention of the grantor.Â  Free v. Sandifer, 131 S.C. 232, 236, 126 S.E. 521, 522 (1925).\r\nHowever, in 1953, this Court created a shared interest in property referred to as a tenancy in common with a right of survivorship.Â  Davis v. Davis, 223 S.C. 182, 191-92, 75 S.E.2d 46, 50 (1953).Â  The Court created the estate of tenancy in common with a right of survivorship because South Carolina did not permit husband and wife to hold property as tenants by the entirety. [3] Â  Id.Â  The Court in Davis opined that by adding the phrase â€œand the survivor of them,â€ the parties clearly indicated that upon the death of either of them the absolute estate should vest in the survivor.Â  Id. at 191, 75 S.E.2d at 50.Â  The Court stated that while a right of survivorship is not incident to a tenancy in common, the parties may create one if they so desire.Â  Id. Â The Court explained that:\r\n\r\nIt has been said that great care must be exercised in construing conveyances to two or more persons and to the survivor or survivors of them. If the intention was to create a tenancy in common for life, with cross remainders for life, with remainder in fee to the ultimate survivor, a joint tenancy would not accomplish the purpose because the right of survivorship may\r\nbe defeated by a conveyance by any joint tenancy [sic] but the vested cross-remainders and, in general, the contingent ultimate remainders are indestructible. Thus, not all instruments which provide that the survivor of a group will ultimately take the fee in severalty contemplate a joint tenancy; the intention may be to create a true future interest by way of a remainder or an executory limitation.Â  (citation omitted) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nDavis, 223 S.C. at 187, 75 S.E.2d at 48.Â  As noted from the excerpt above, the Court held that the future interests created by a tenancy in common with a right of survivorship were indestructible - i.e. not subject to defeat by the unilateral act of one cotenant.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn 2000, the legislature created, by statute, the estate of joint tenants with a right of survivorship.Â  The Code directs that:\r\n\r\n[i]n addition to any other methods for the creation of a joint tenancy in real estate which may exist by law, whenever any deed of conveyance of real estate contains the names of the grantees followed by the words â€œas joint tenants with rights of survivorship, and not as tenants in commonâ€ the creation of a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship in the real estate is conclusively deemed to have been created.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-40 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nThis Court recognizes that the two estates at issue have many similar characteristics.Â  However, unlike a tenancy in common with a right of survivorship, a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship is capable of being defeated by the unilateral act of one joint tenant.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-40(a)(v), (vii), and (viii) (depicting actions that can be taken by one joint tenant to effectively sever the joint tenancy).Â  Further, property held in joint tenancy is subject to partition.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-10 (2005) (stating that all joint tenants may be compelled to partition).Â  In contrast, a tenancy in common with a right of survivorship cannot be defeated by the act of one tenant absent the agreement of the other tenant.\r\nWe note at the outset that Â§ 27-7-40 cited above and relied on by the court of appeals, creating a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship, was not enacted until after the deed in the current case was executed.Â  As a result, the parties to the deed could not have intended to take advantage of the statute creating the estate of joint tenancy with a right of survivorship.Â  However, the estate of joint tenancy still existed in South Carolina, but as previously noted this Court construed documents in favor of tenancies.[4] Â Â \r\nIn the present case, the language of the deed clearly indicates that the parties intended to create a right of survivorship.Â  However, the question before this Court centers on the type ownership held by both husband and wife and whether the property is subject to partition. \r\nWe hold that the use of the phrase â€œfor and during their joint lives and upon the death of either of them, them to the survivor of themâ€ indicates an intention of the parties to share a tenancy in common for life, with cross remainders for life, with remainder in fee to the ultimate survivor.Â  The deed here conveyed a true future interest in the property to the survivor of the two.Â  This is distinct from a joint tenancy, where the full estate is vested immediately and one of the parties could end the joint tenancy.Â  However, with a tenancy in common with a right of survivorship the property will go only to the survivor of the parties and the future interest does not vest until the death of one of the co-owners.Â  We further hold that this conveyance does not unreasonably prevent the alienation of the property because the restriction exists only until the first tenant in common dies.\r\nAs a result, the court of appeals erred in holding that the property was subject to partition.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we reverse the court of appeals.Â  The deed in the present case created a tenancy in common with a right of survivorship.Â  Under Davis, the survivorship rights between tenants in common create true future interests in the entire estate that cannot be destroyed by the unilateral act of one tenant through an act such as partition.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner, a woman in her seventies, and Respondent, a man in his eighties, married in June 2000.Â  The property at issue was bought by Petitioner and owned by her most of her adult life.Â  No other person owned an interest in the property until after the marriage when Petitioner deeded a share to Respondent.Â  According to Petitionerâ€™s testimony, she wanted to make sure that if she were to predecease Respondent that he would get the property.\r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-10 states that â€œ[a]ll joint tenants and tenants in common who hold, jointly or in common . . . . shall be compellable to make severance and partition of such lands, tenements and hereditaments.â€\r\n[3]  The Married Womenâ€™s Property Act was construed to abolish tenancy by the entirety.Â  See Davis, 223 S.C. at 189, 75 S.E.2d at 49.\r\n[4] Petitioner contends that joint tenancy has been abandoned in South Carolina.Â  While courts have moved away from construing language in conveyances in favor of a joint tenancy, joint tenancy has not been entirely abolished.Â  Joint tenancy was disfavored as a rule of construction, but has existed and continues to exist today.Â  See Herbemont v. Thomas, 15 Chev. Eq. 21 (S.C. 1839); Ball v. Deas, 2 Strob. Eq. 24 (S.C. 1848) (finding that language in a deed created a joint tenancy between the parties to the deed).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26087","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES: Â This is a death-penalty case.Â  Appellant Brad Keith Sigmon (Sigmon) was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of first-degree burglary.Â  He was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment for burglary and to death for murder.Â  Before recommending the death penalty, the jury found the following aggravating circumstances: Sigmon murdered two persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct; Sigmon committed the murder while committing burglary; and Sigmon committed the murder while committing physical torture.[1]Â  The jury found no mitigating circumstances.Â  Sigmon appeals from the murder convictions only.Â  This opinion consolidates the appeal and mandatory sentence review.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe material facts are undisputed.Â  Sigmon entered the dwelling of the two victims without consent and with intent to commit a crime.Â  While in the dwelling, Sigmon unlawfully killed the victims with malice aforethought by repeatedly striking them in their heads with a baseball bat.Â  \r\nSigmon was indicted for two counts of murder and one count of first-degree burglary.Â  Neither murder indictment included an allegation of aggravating circumstances.Â  \r\nAlmost one year prior to trial, the state gave Sigmon written notice of its intention to seek the death penalty.[2]Â  Four weeks prior to trial, the state gave Sigmon written notice that it intended to introduce evidence that Sigmon committed the murders while committing burglary; that he murdered two or more persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct; and that he committed the murders while committing physical torture.[3]Â  \r\nAt his arraignment, Sigmon stated his intention to admit at trial that he was guilty of the charged offenses.Â  He pleaded not guilty, however, because he wanted a jury to determine his punishment.[4]\r\nThe jury found Sigmon guilty on all counts.Â  At the subsequent penalty phase of the trial, the jury found all three aggravating circumstances mentioned above and recommended that Sigmon be sentenced to death.Â  The circuit court sentenced Sigmon to thirty years imprisonment for first-degree burglary and to death for murder.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the murder convictions must be reversed because the\r\nmurder indictments included no allegations of aggravation.Â Â  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that â€œ[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  Because that provision is incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,[5] an accused enjoys the same right in a state prosecution.[6]Â  Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 818, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 2533-34, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562, 572 (1975). Â This right is satisfied if the notice is reasonable.Â  In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273, 68 S. Ct. 499, 507, 92 L. Ed. 682, 694 (1948).Â  \r\nWe agree with Sigmon that his right to reasonable notice of the charges against him encompassed the right to notice of any aggravating circumstances to be alleged at trial.Â  Contrary to Sigmonâ€™s assertion, however, neither Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556 (2002), nor Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000), mandates that such notice be given through the indictment.Â  In fact, the United States Supreme Court â€œexpressly noted in both Apprendi and Ring that the cases did not involve challenges to state indictments. ... More important, the Fourteenth Amendment has not been construed to incorporate the Fifth Amendment's Presentment or Indictment Clause. ... State law governs indictments for state-law crimes. ... Under South Carolina law, aggravating circumstances need not be alleged in an indictment for murder.â€Â  State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 147-48, 604 S.E.2d 377, 380-81 (2004) (citations omitted) (followed in State v. Crisp, 362 S.C. 412, 419-20, 608 S.E.2d 429, 433-34 (2005), and State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 135, 144, 607 S.E.2d 57, 61 (2004)).Â  Compliance with Code sections 16-3-20(B) and 16-3-26(A) is sufficient to put an accused on reasonable notice that aggravating circumstances are alleged and that the death penalty is sought.Â  Sigmon does not assert that the stateâ€™s notice of evidence of aggravation did not comport with statutory requirements, or that he was denied due process because the notice was not given in sufficient advance of trial.Â  \r\nSENTENCE REVIEW\r\nWe must review Sigmonâ€™s death sentence, based on the record, to determine whether the sentence is disproportionate to the crime committed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(A) (2003).Â  In conducting the review, we consider similar cases in which the death penalty has been upheld.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E) (2003).\r\nWe conclude that Sigmonâ€™s death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and that the evidence supports the juryâ€™s findings of aggravation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003).Â  Further, in comparison with similar cases, Sigmonâ€™s sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to his crime.Â  See State v. Vazsquez, 364 S.C. 293, 613 S.E.2d 359 (2005) (involving a double murder committed in the course of robbery); State v. Hill, 361 S.C. 297, 604 S.E.2d 696 (2004) (involving a triple murder); State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 596 S.E.2d 475 (2004) (involving a quadruple murder committed in the course of burglary); State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004) (involving a murder committed in the course of physical torture); State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 577 S.E.2d 438 (2003) (involving a triple murder committed in the course of burglary); State v. Weik, 356 S.C. 76, 587 S.E.2d 683 (2003) (involving a murder committed in the course of burglary and physical torture); State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000) (involving a double murder committed in the course of burglary). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSigmonâ€™s constitutional right to notice of the charges against him was not violated.Â  Further, his death sentence was proportionate to his crime.Â  His murder convictions and death sentence are therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.Â Â  Â Â \r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ.Â  Acting Justice Diane S. Goodstein, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(b), (h) and (9) (2003).\r\n[2] This notice must be given at least thirty days prior to trial.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-26(A) (2003).\r\n[3] Notice of evidence of aggravation must be given, in writing, prior to trial.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B) (2003).Â  As discussed below, Sigmon does not argue that his due-process rights were violated because the stateâ€™s notice was untimely.\r\n[4] A jury trial on punishment is unavailable to a defendant who pleads guilty to murder.Â  See Â§ 16-3-20(B).\r\n[5] U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1.\r\n[6] The South Carolina Constitution similarly provides that â€œ[a]ny person charged with an offense shall enjoy the right ... to be fully informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.â€Â  S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 14. Â Sigmon relies only on his right under the United States Constitution.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to Rule 608(d)(1)(E), SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2005-12-14-01","description":"This order amends Rule 608(d)(1)(E), SCACR, by changing","date":"2005-12-19","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South\r\nCarolina\r\nIn re: Amendment to Rule 608(d)(1)(E),\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\nPursuant to Article V, Â§ 4, of the South Carolina Constitution, we hereby amend Rule 608(d)(1)(E), SCACR, by changing â€œSouth Carolina\r\nAdministrative Law Divisionâ€ to â€œSouth Carolina Administrative Law Court.â€Â  This amendment shall become effective immediately.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.

Floyd (Darla) is the mother of Plaintiff Dana N. Floyd (Dana).Â  Dana suffered serious injuries in an automobile collision on September 19, 2003, when her car was struck by another automobile.Â  The at-fault driverâ€™s liability carrier paid its policy limits of $15,000 to Dana in exchange for a covenant not to execute a judgment against the at-fault driver.\r\nDana filed a claim with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. (Nationwide), seeking to recover against underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage.Â  Dana, a Class I insured,[1] sought to stack UIM coverages for each of three vehicles covered by the Nationwide policy purchased by her mother.Â  Dana sued Nationwide after it refused to pay benefits and the case was removed to federal district court on Nationwideâ€™s motion.\r\nDarla purchased a Nationwide policy in 1997.Â  A Nationwide agentâ€™s employee completed a form titled â€œOffer of Optional Additional Uninsured and Underinsured Automobile Insurance Coverages.â€Â  The employee checked the â€œnoâ€ box which followed the question â€œDo you wish to purchase underinsured motorists coverage?â€Â  The employee checked the â€œyesâ€ box which followed the question â€œDo you wish to purchase additional uninsured motorists coverage?â€ and wrote â€œ15/30â€ and â€œ25,000â€ on lines for selecting the desired limits.\r\nDarla signed the UIM offer form indicating her rejection of UIM coverage, thereby purchasing only the minimum liability limits and corresponding uninsured motorist (UM) coverage.Â  Darla also signed the â€œApplicantâ€™s Acknowledgmentâ€ at the end of the UIM offer form.Â  This paragraph stated:\r\n\r\nI hereby acknowledge that I have read, or have had read to me, the above explanations and offers of additional uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage.Â  I have indicated whether or not I wish to purchase each coverage in the spaces provided.Â  I further understand that the above explanations of these coverages are intended only to be brief descriptions of uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage, and that payment of benefits under any of these coverages is subject both to the terms and conditions of my automobile insurance policy and to the State of South Carolinaâ€™s laws.\r\n\r\nDarla did not otherwise personally mark the UIM offer form to select desired coverages and limits.\r\nDarla increased the coverage limits on her policy in 2000.Â  An employee in the Nationwide insurance agentâ€™s office completed another UIM offer form, checking the â€œnoâ€ box which followed the question â€œDo you wish to purchase underinsured motorist coverage?â€Â  The agentâ€™s employee checked the â€œyesâ€ box which followed the question â€œDo you wish to purchase additional uninsured motorist coverage?â€ and wrote â€œ100/300â€ and â€œ50,000â€ on lines for selecting the desired limits.\r\nDarla again signed the form in two places -rejecting UIM coverage and below the â€œApplicantâ€™s Acknowledgment,â€ the same paragraph set forth above.Â  Darla did not otherwise personally mark the UIM offer form to select desired coverages and limits.\r\nAt her deposition, Darla testified she signed the offer forms, but did not read the forms or have someone read them to her.Â  No one explained or discussed UIM coverage or the offer form with her, and she did not understand UIM coverage at the time she signed the forms.Â  She did not recall reading the acknowledgment paragraph before signing the forms.Â  â€œTo the best of my rememberance (sic), I was told what I needed and given the paper to sign,â€ Darla testified.Â  â€œI was given the paper to sign and I signed it.Â  I was not explained that I needed to read it.â€\r\nNationwide relies solely on the two UIM offer forms as proof that it made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Darla, and not on any verbal discussions or explanations of the coverage.Â  The parties agree both UIM forms are identical to South Carolina Department of Insurance Form 2006 and contain the content required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A) (2002).\r\nQUESTION\r\n\r\nIs an offer form in which the blanks were filled in by an insurance agent or his employee in the presence of the named insured, and the form was then signed by the named insured, properly completed and executed pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (2002), such that the form may be conclusively presumed to constitute a meaningful offer of UIM coverage?[2]\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn answering a certified question raising a novel question of law, the Court is free to decide the question based on its assessment of which answer and reasoning would best comport with the law and public policies of this state and the Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and right.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2004)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same); Antley v. New York Life Ins. Co., 139 S.C. 23, 30, 137 S.E. 199, 201 (1927) (â€œIn [a] state of conflict between the decisions, it is up to the court to â€˜choose ye this day whom ye will serveâ€™; and, in the duty of this decision, the court has the right to determine which doctrine best appeals to its sense of law, justice, and right.â€).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nPlaintiffs argue that, in order for the UIM offer form to be â€œproperly completed and executed by the named insuredâ€ pursuant to Section 38-77-150(B), the named insured not only must sign the offer form, but also must personally fill in the blanks to indicate the desired coverages and limits. Plaintiffs point to language in Section 38-77-150(A) requiring the offer form to contain â€œa space for the insured to markâ€ whether the insured wishes to accept or reject UIM and additional UM coverages, a â€œspace for the insured to selectâ€ the coverage limits desired, and â€œa space for the insured to signâ€ the form to acknowledge the coverages have been offered to her.Â  Plaintiffs further contend that imposing such a requirement would compel insurers to require the named insured read the form rather than simply signing a form prepared by an insurance agent or his employee.Â  This practice would better fulfill the Legislatureâ€™s intent that a meaningful offer actually be made to the insured before an executed form is presumed to constitute such an offer.\r\nNationwide argues it is entitled to benefit from the statutory presumption that a meaningful offer is made when the named insured signs the form as required, regardless of whether an agent or his employee filled in the blanks to indicate the desired coverages and limits.Â  Darla has not asserted the form was erroneously completed by the agentâ€™s employee, but has argued only that the manner in which it was completed is improper under the statute.Â  Consequently, Nationwide contends the interpretation of the statute suggested by Plaintiffs would lead to an absurd result because the Legislature could not have intended to disallow the presumption of a meaningful offer in such circumstances.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Legislature.Â  Mid-State Automotive Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  The true guide to statutory construction is not the phraseology of an isolated section or provision, but the language of the statute as a whole considered in light of its manifest purpose.Â  Jackson v. Charleston County School Dist., 316 S.C. 177, 181, 447 S.E.2d 859, 861 (1994).Â  A statute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.Â  The real purpose and intent of the lawmakers will prevail over the literal import of particular words.Â  Browning v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992).Â  \r\nThe central purpose of the UIM statute is to provide coverage when the injured partyâ€™s damages exceed the liability limits of the at-fault motorist.Â  Cobb v. Benjamin, 325 S.C. 573, 583, 482 S.E.2d 589, 594 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The UIM and UM statutes are remedial in nature and enacted for the benefit of injured persons; therefore, they should be construed liberally to effect the purpose intended by the Legislature.Â  Cf. Gunnels v. American Liberty Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 242, 247, 161 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1968) (stating this principle with regard to UM coverage).Â  \r\nAutomobile insurance carriers are required to offer, at the option of the insured, UIM coverage up to the limits of the insuredâ€™s liability coverage.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).Â  The insurer bears the burden of establishing that it made a meaningful offer of UIM and additional UM coverages.Â  Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Leachman, 362 S.C. 344, 348, 608 S.E.2d 569, 571 (2005); Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 405, 475 S.E.2d 758, 759 (1996).Â  A noncomplying offer has the legal effect of no offer at all.Â  Hanover Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 301 S.C. 55, 57, 389 S.E.2d 657, 659 (1990).Â  â€œIf the insurer fails to comply with its statutory duty to make a meaningful offer to the insured, the policy will be reformed, by operation of law, to include UIM coverage up to the limits of liability insurance carried by the insured.â€Â  Butler, 323 S.C. at 405, 475 S.E.2d at 760.\r\nIn order for an insurer to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage, (1) the insurerâ€™s notification process must be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing; (2) the insurer must specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional coverage in general terms; (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage; and (4) the insured must be told that optional coverages are available for an additional premium.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 345 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1987).Â  In response to Wannamaker, the Legislature enacted Section 38-77-350 to establish the requirements for forms used in making offers of optional insurance coverage such as UIM.Â  Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 362 S.C. at 349, 608 S.E.2d at 571-72.Â  \r\nSection 38-77-350 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(A)Â  The director or his designee shall approve a form which automobile insurers shall use in offering optional coverages required to be offered pursuant to law to applicants for automobile insurance policies. Â This form must be used by insurers for all new applicants. Â The form, at a minimum, must provide for each optional coverage required to be offered:\r\n  \r\n(1) Â a brief and concise explanation of the coverage,\r\n(2) Â a list of available limits and the range of premiums for the limits,\r\n(3) Â a space for the insured to mark whether the insured chooses to accept or reject the coverage and a space for the insured to select the limits of coverage he desires,\r\n(4) Â a space for the insured to sign the form which acknowledges that he has\r\nbeen offered the optional coverages,\r\n(5) Â the mailing address and telephone number of the Insurance Department which the applicant may contact if the applicant has any questions that the insurance agent is unable to answer.Â  [Emphasis added.]\r\n  \r\n(B) Â If this form is properly completed and executed by the named insured it is conclusively presumed that there was an informed, knowing selection of coverage and neither the insurance company nor any insurance agent has any liability to the named insured or any other insured under the policy for the insuredâ€™s failure to purchase any optional coverage or higher limits.\r\n. . .\r\n(D)Â  Compliance with this section satisfies the insurer and agentâ€™s duty to explain and offer optional coverages and higher limits and no person, including, but not limited to, an insurer and insurance agent is liable in an\r\naction for damages on account of the selection or rejection made by the named insured.\r\n\r\nAn insurer enjoys a presumption it made a meaningful offer when a form is executed in compliance with this statute.Â  Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 362 S.C. at 349, 608 S.E.2d at 571-72; Section Â§ 38-77-350(B).Â  The insurer may not benefit from the protections of the statute when the form does not comply with the statute.Â  Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 362 S.C. at 349, 608 S.E.2d at 572; Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 486, 462 S.E.2d 291, 295 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Furthermore, a form does not necessarily constitute a meaningful offer simply because it was approved by the Department of Insurance.Â  Butler, 323 S.C. at 408-409, 475 S.E.2d at 761.Â  The purpose of requiring automobile insurers to make a meaningful offer of additional UM or UIM coverage â€œis for insureds to know their options and to make an informed decision as to which amount of coverage will best suit their needs.â€Â  Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 362 S.C. at 352, 608 S.E.2d at 573. \r\nWe acknowledge that a competent person usually is presumed to have knowledge and understanding of a document he signs, absent evidence his signature was obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, or duress.Â  See Moye v. Wilson Motors, Inc., 254 S.C. 471, 479-80, 176 S.E.2d 147, 151-52 (1970) (automobile insurance contract); Camden Inv. Co. v. Gibson, 204 S.C. 513, 519, 30 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1944) (lease agreement); Horton v. Atlantic Life Ins. Co., 187 S.C. 155, 197 S.E. 512 (1938) (life insurance contract); Federal Land Bank of Columbia v.

Ins. Co., 362 S.C. at 352, 608 S.E.2d at 573.Â  \r\nOur decision does not resolve the question of whether Insurer made a meaningful offer to Darla in this case.Â  We simply conclude that Insurer, by allowing an agent or his employee to partially complete the offer form in a manner inconsistent with the plain terms of Section 38-77-350, is denied the benefit of the conclusive statutory presumption a meaningful offer was made.Â  Such a case presents a factual issue for resolution by the factfinder, with the insurer bearing the burdens of proof and persuasion in demonstrating whether a meaningful offer was made to the insured pursuant to the Wannamaker analysis.Â  Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 362 S.C. at 349, 608 S.E.2d at 572; Osborne, 319 S.C. at 486, 462 S.E.2d at 295.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude an offer form in which the blanks were filled in by an insurance agent or his employee in the presence of the named insured, and the form was then signed by the named insured, was not properly completed and executed pursuant to Section 38-77-350(B), such that the form may be conclusively presumed to constitute a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to the named insured.\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice John W. Kittredge, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Class I insureds include the named insured and his or her spouse and relatives residing in the same household.Â  Class II insureds are those using the insured vehicle with permission of the named insured and a guest in the motor vehicle.Â  In South Carolina, only Class I insureds can stack coverage.Â  See e.g. Concrete Servs., Inc. v.

Pender for debt collection.Â  On March 14, 2003, a default judgment was entered in favor of Appellant against Pender.\r\nIn April 2003, the Law Offices of Paul J. Kamber represented a\r\nKim A. Pender in a real estate closing.Â  In preparation for the closing, Kamberâ€™s office sought to determine whether Kamber represented the same Kim A. Pender who was subject to Appellantâ€™s default judgment.Â  On April 14, 2003, Missy Wilson (Respondent), Kamberâ€™s legal assistant, faxed an inquiry to Appellant requesting identification data on the Pender subject to Appellantâ€™s judgment.Â  On the same day, Appellant replied to the request and asked Kamber for identification data of his client.Â  Kamberâ€™s office did not reply.Â  On April 26, 2003, Appellant again requested the identification data on Kamberâ€™s client, but Kamberâ€™s office did not reply. \r\nOn May 12, 2003, Appellant served Respondent or the records\r\ncustodian of Kamberâ€™s office with a subpoena duces tecum requesting â€œyour entire Kim Pender file.â€Â  On or about May 19, 2003, Respondent served a motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum on the grounds the documents in the file were protected by the attorney-client privilege and there was no pending action between Appellant and Pender.Â  Appellant filed a return to Respondentâ€™s motion on July 15, 2003.\r\nAt a hearing on Respondentâ€™s motion, Appellant admitted it had\r\nnot attempted enforcement of the judgment against Pender by issuance of a writ of execution or through supplemental proceedings.Â  Appellant argued post-judgment discovery before enforcement of the judgment is proper under Rule 69,\r\nSCRCP. \r\nBy Order filed July 17, 2003, the circuit court granted Respondentâ€™s motion to quash, concluding Rule 69, SCRCP, did not permit discovery after judgment except in supplementary proceedings or in aid of execution.Â  Further, the requested documents were subject to attorney-client privilege, which had not been waived. Â Â Â Â Â  Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Is an order quashing a subpoena duces tecum, which was issued to a nonparty prior to the commencement of enforcement of a judgment, immediately appealable?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the lower court err in granting Respondentâ€™s motion to quash on the ground that the discovery was improper under Rule 69, SCRCP?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appealability\r\nAppellant argues the lower court order quashing the subpoena duces tecum is immediately appealable.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe novel issue presented in this case is whether an order quashing a subpoena duces tecum, issued to a nonparty prior to the commencement of enforcement of a judgment, is immediately appealable.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004) addresses appellate jurisdiction.[2]Â  Section 14-3-330 provides:\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in law cases, and shall review upon appeal: \r\n(1) Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of common pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final judgments in such actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such final judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before appealed from;\r\n(2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action; \r\n(3) A final order affecting a substantial right made in any special proceeding or upon a summary application in any action after judgment; and\r\n(4) An interlocutory order or decree in a court of common pleas\r\ngranting, continuing, modifying, or refusing an injunction or granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing the appointment of a receiver. \r\n\r\nAs a general rule, only final judgments are appealable.\r\nCulbertson v. Clemens, 322 S.C. 20, 23, 471 S.E.2d 163, 164 (1996).Â  Any judgment or decree,\r\nleaving some further act to be done by the court before the rights of the parties are determined, is interlocutory and not final. Â Mid-State Distribs., Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 336, 426 S.E.2d 777, 780 (1993).Â  See also Good v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemn. Co., 201 S.C. 32, 21 S.E.2d 209 (1942) (â€œa final judgment is one which operates to divest some right in such a manner as to put it beyond the power of the Court making the order to place the parties in their original condition after the expiration of the term . . . .â€).Â  \r\nWe have previously held an order denying or compelling pretrial discovery is not directly appealable since it is an intermediate or interlocutory decision.Â  Lowndes Products, Inc. v. Brower, 262 S.C. 431, 205 S.E.2d 184 (1974); Patterson v. Specter Broadcasting Corp., 287 S.C. 249, 335 S.E.2d 803 (1985).Â  Also, we have held an order directing a nonparty to submit to discovery is not immediately appealable.Â  Ex parte Whetstone, 289 S.C. 580, 347 S.E.2d 881 (1986).\r\nSimilarly, an order quashing a subpoena duces tecum issued to a\r\nnonparty prior to commencement of enforcement of a judgment, is interlocutory and not immediately appealable.Â  This discovery order is not a final order because it leaves some further act to be done by the court before the rights of the parties in an enforcement proceeding are determined. [3]Â  \r\nAbsent some specialized statute, the immediate appealability of\r\nan interlocutory or intermediate order depends on whether the order falls within Â§ 14-3-330.Â \r\nBaldwin Const. Co., Inc. v. Graham, 357 S.C. 227, 593 S.E.2d 146 (2004).Â  Intermediate orders involving the merits may be immediately appealed pursuant to Â§ 14-3-330(1).Â  An order which involves the merits is one that â€œmust finally determine some substantial matter forming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense.â€Â  Mid-State Distribs., Inc., 310 S.C. at 334, 426 S.E.2d at 780.Â  Interlocutory orders affecting a substantial right may be immediately appealed pursuant to Â§ 14-3-330(2).Â  Orders affecting a substantial right â€œdiscontinue an action, prevent an appeal, grant or refuse a new trial, or strike out an action or defense.â€Â  Id. at 335 n.4, 426 S.E.2d at 780 n.4.Â  We conclude the order quashing the subpoena duces tecum neither involves the merits nor affects a substantial right, and the order is, therefore, not immediately appealable. \r\nAppellant argues the order granted an injunction and is, therefore,\r\nimmediately appealable pursuant to Â§ 14-3-330(4).Â  Further, Appellant argues this Court can consider the order because there is an otherwise appealable issue before the Court.Â  Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 564 S.E.2d 94 (2002) (an order that is not directly appealable will nonetheless be considered if there is an appealable issue before the court and a ruling on appeal will avoid unnecessary litigation).Â  Appellantâ€™s arguments are without merit.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Discovery under Rule 69, SCRCP\r\nAlthough, we dismiss the order as not immediately appealable, we address this novel issue in the interest of judicial economy.Â  Appellant argues post-judgment discovery may be properly conducted under Rule 69, SCRCP, without the issuance of a writ of execution or the commencement of supplementary proceedings.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 69 is entitled â€œExecutionâ€ and provides:Â  \r\nProcess to enforce a judgment for the payment of money shall be a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise.Â  The procedure on execution, in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of a judgment, and in proceedings on and in aid of execution shall be as provided by law.Â  In the aid of the judgment or execution, the judgment creditor or his successor in interest when that interest appears of record, may examine any person, including the judgment debtor, in the manner provided in these rules for obtaining discovery.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Notes to Rule 69, SCRCP, state: â€œThis Rule 69 is substantially the Federal Rule, omitting references to Federal Statutes.Â  It preserves by reference present State practice under S.C. Code Sections 15-39-10 through 15-39-150, and brings to the assistance of the judgment creditor the right to obtain discovery under Rules 26 through 37.â€[5]Â Â  \r\nIn interpreting the meaning of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court applies the same rules of construction used to interpret statutes.Â  Maxwell v. Genez, 356 S.C. 617, 591 S.E.2d 26 (2003); Green v. Lewis Truck Lines, Inc., 314 S.C. 303, 443 S.E.2d 906 (1994).Â  If a ruleâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, interpretation is unnecessary and the stated meaning should be enforced. See Maxwell, 356 S.C. at 617, 591 S.E.2d at 26; Knotts v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Resources, 348 S.C. 1, 10, 558 S.E.2d 511, 516 (2002).Â  Courts should consider not only the particular clause in which a word may be used, but the word and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole rule and the policy of the rule. S.C. Coastal Council v. S.C. State Ethics Commâ€™n, 306 S.C. 41, 44, 410 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1991) (applying this rule of construction to a statutory provision).Â  In construing a rule, language in the rule must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose. Â Mun. Assâ€™n of S.C. v. AT&amp;T Communications of Southern States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 606 S.E.2d 468 (2004) (applying this rule of construction to a statutory provision).Â  The Rules of Civil Procedure â€œshall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.â€Â  Rule 1, SCRCP.\r\nWhen the phrase â€œ[i]n the aid of the judgment or executionâ€ in the last sentence of Rule 69 is construed in conjunction with the purpose of the ruleâ€”execution of a judgment either by a writ of execution or by supplemental proceedingsâ€”and the policy of the rule, the phrase must relate back to the two previous sentences.Â  The phrase in question can be harmonized with the subject matter of the ruleâ€”Executionâ€”by reading Rule 69 to require the issuance of a writ of execution or initiation of supplementary proceedings before post-judgment discovery is conducted.Â  See Anchor Gas, Inc. v. Border Black Top, Inc., 381 N.W.2d 96, 97-98 (Minn. Ct. App. 1986) (post-judgment discovery under Rule 69, Minn. RCP, may be conducted after issuance of writ of execution but prior to the writ being returned as unsatisfied).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe dismiss the appeal because the order quashing the subpoena duces tecum is not immediately appealable.Â  Further, in clarifying the procedure for discovery under Rule 69, SCRCP, we conclude the rule requires a writ of execution be issued or supplementary proceedings initiated before discovery may be commenced.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Stephen S. Bartlett, concur,\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We have modified the case caption to accurately reflect the status of the parties on appeal. \r\n[2]Â  Section 14-3-330 also applies to equity cases.Â  See Charleston County Depâ€™t Soc. Servs. v. Father, Stepmother, and Mother, 317 S.C. 283, 287, 454 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1995).Â  Supplementary proceedings are equitable in nature.Â  Ex Parte Roddey, 171 S.C. 489, 172 S.E. 866 (1934).\r\n[3]Â  See Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Express Freight Lines, Inc., 971 F.2d 5, 6 (1992) (citations omitted): \r\nThe judgment entered pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 ends the proceeding to determine liability and relief, but it begins the collection proceeding if the defendant refuses to pay. A contested collection proceeding will end in a judgment or a series of judgments granting supplementary relief to the plaintiff. The judgment that concludes the collection proceeding is the judgment from which the defendant can appeal.\r\n[4]Â  See generally  Johnson v. Serv. Mgmt., Inc., 319 S.C. 165, 166, 459 S.E.2d 900, 902 (Ct. App. 1995), affirmed in part,\r\n324 S.C. 198, 478 S.E.2d 63 (1996):Â \r\n\r\nJudgments generally are enforced by writs of execution issued to the sheriff. See S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-180 (1976) (providing that judgments requiring the payment of money or the delivery of real or personal property â€œmay be enforced in those respects by execution as provided in this Title.â€); S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-80 (setting forth the requirements for the contents of the execution, including that it be directed to the sheriff and intelligibly refer to the judgment, stating the court, the county in which the judgment roll or transcript is filed, and the amount of the judgment).Â  If a judgment is unsatisfied, the judgment creditor may institute supplementary proceedings to discover assets. S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-310.Â  Supplementary proceedings also â€œfurnish a means of reaching, in aid of the judgment, property beyond the reach of an ordinary execution, such as choses in action.â€Â  Lynn v. International Brotherhood of Firemen &amp; Oilers, 228 S.C. 357, 362, 90 S.E.2d 204, 206 (1955).\r\n\r\n[5]Â  Rule 34, SCRCP, incorporates by reference Rule 45, SCRCP. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
