Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the denial of Post-Conviction Relief (PCR) to Petitioner, Daniel Staggs.Â  The sole issue we need address is whether trial counsel had a conflict of interest in representing Staggs in his trial for murder, while simultaneously representing Staggsâ€™ father, mother and brother on accessory after the fact charges.[1]Â  We find that he did and, accordingly, we reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nStaggs was arrested for the murder of Daniel L. Grier.Â  It appears Grier was shot after he and Staggs were engaged in a â€œroad rageâ€ type incident in Greenville. Â Staggs was represented by attorney Michael A. Devine.[2]Â  Subsequent to Staggsâ€™ arrest, his father, mother and brother were charged as accessories after the fact.Â  Thereafter, Devine undertook to represent his Â father, mother and brother while simultaneously representing Staggs on the murder charge.Â  Â Â \r\nStaggs did not testify at trial based upon counselâ€™s recommendation.Â  Counsel also declined to offer the testimony of Staggsâ€™ family members at trial.Â  Staggs was convicted of murder and possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime and sentenced to life plus five years for the weapons charge.Â  \r\nStaggs filed for PCR, contending counsel had a conflict of interest in representing him together with his family members.Â  The PCR court denied relief.Â  We reverse.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTo establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel due to a conflict of interest arising from multiple representation, a defendant who did not object at trial must show an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his attorneyâ€™s performance.Â  Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335 (1980); Fuller v. State, 347 S.C. 630, 557 S.E.2d 664 (2001); Thomas v. State, 346 S.C. 140, 551 S.E.2d 254 (2001).Â  An actual conflict of interest occurs where an attorney owes a duty to a party whose interests are adverse to the defendantâ€™s.Â  Id.Â  In Thomas, this Court held that a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice to obtain relief.Â Â  \r\nStaggs asserts Devine had an actual conflict inasmuch as the interests of his mother, father, and brother were adverse to his own. Â We agree.Â Â Â  \r\nAt PCR, Staggs testified Devine advised him he did not want him taking the stand in order to preserve the right to final closing argument.Â  However, Staggsâ€™ sister-in-law, who is married to his brother Yancey, testified that Devine told her he was not going to allow Staggs to testify because â€œhe say he cannot testify because he was representing all four of us. Â And if Daniel said, if anything, it could hurt us.Â  If we said anything, it could hurt Daniel.Â  It was in our best interest that nobody said anything about anybody.â€Â  Staggsâ€™ father Billy testified similarly at PCR that Devine had told him to persuade Staggs not to testify because it might hurt their case.Â  \r\nIt is clear from the testimony of Staggsâ€™ father and sister-in-law that Devine had an actual conflict of interest and that the conflict adversely affected his performance.Â  Under Fuller and Thomas, Staggs is clearly entitled to relief.Â  Accordingly, the order of the PCR court denying Staggs relief is reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Although Staggs also raised the issue of trial counselâ€™s failure to preserve issues relating to the trial courtâ€™s self-defense and manslaughter charges, we need not address those issues in light of our remand for a new trial.\r\n[2] Â Staggs also had co-counsel; however, Devine was lead counsel.Â  Devine has since been indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.Â Â  In the Matter of Devine, 345 S.C. 633, 550 S.E.2d 308 (2001).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26298","title":"City of Camden v.

C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1) for an order compelling Fairfield to cease and desist.Â Â  The circuit court ruled Fairfield had no legal authority to provide electricity to the new Loweâ€™s store.Â  Fairfield appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err in ruling Fairfield was without authority to service the new Loweâ€™s store?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-29-240, a rural electric cooperative generally has the power to sell and distribute electricity only in rural areas, i.e., those with a population under 2500.Â  Carolina Power and Light v. Town of Pageland, 321 S.C. 538, 471 S.E.2d 137 (1996).Â  There are two exceptions to this rule contained in South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1), to wit: \r\n\r\n  1) a cityâ€™s act of incorporating or annexing into a city or town an area in which the cooperative is serving shall constitute the consent of the governing body of such city or town for the cooperative to continue serving all premises then being served and to serve additional premises within such area until such time as the governing body of the city or town shall direct otherwise, and \r\n  2) the right of a cooperative to continue to serve in a city or town in which it is the principal supplier of electricity shall not be affected by the subsequent growth of such town beyond a population of two thousand five hundred persons.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).Â  The purpose of the exceptions is to â€œprevent the ouster of co-ops from areas they have historically served due to population growth or annexation.â€ Duke Power Laurens Elec. Co-op., Inc., 344 S.C. 101, 105, 543 S.E.2d 560, 562 (Ct.App.2001).Â  \r\nIt is undisputed here that the second exception does not apply as Fairfield is not the principal supplier of the disputed area.Â  Accordingly, the sole issue before us is whether the Loweâ€™s store was a â€œpremises then being servedâ€ at the time of annexation so as to come within the first exception.Â  We find that it does not. \r\nThe term â€œpremisesâ€ is not defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-10 et seq., the Electric Cooperative Act.Â  The circuit court therefore looked to the definition of â€œpremisesâ€ contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-610 (2) of the Territorial Assignments Act of 1969.Â Â  That section defines â€œpremisesâ€ as follows:\r\n\r\n  the building, structure or facility to which electricity is being or is to be furnished;Â  provided, that two or more buildings, structures or facilities which are located on one tract or contiguous tracts of land and are utilized by one electric consumer for farming, business, commercial, industrial, institutional or governmental purposes, shall together constitute one â€œpremises,â€ except that any such building, structure or facility shall not, together with any other building, structure or facility, constitute one â€œpremisesâ€ if the electric service to it is separately metered and the charges for such service are calculated independently of charges for service to any other building, structure or facility.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court ruled the security light placed on the unimproved lot owned by Town and Country did not constitute a â€œbuilding, structure or facilityâ€ to which electricity was being furnished, such that it was not a â€œpremises then being servedâ€ pursuant to the statute and therefore did not come within this exception.Â  Fairfield asserts the circuit courtâ€™s reliance upon this definition of â€œpremiseâ€ is misplaced inasmuch as the Territorial Assignments Act was enacted some six years after passage of the Electric Cooperative Act.Â  Accordingly, it contends the Legislature could not have intended for this definition of â€œpremisesâ€ to apply in the context of Â§ 33-49-250(1).Â  We disagree.Â  We find the circuit court properly looked to the definition of â€œpremisesâ€ as set forth in Â§ 58-27-610(2), and the court properly applied that definition.Â  \r\nThere is a presumption that the legislature has knowledge of previous legislation when later statutes are enacted concerning related subjects.Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 648, 576 S.E.2d 168, 174 (2003); Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 426 S.E.2d 760 (1993).Â  Accordingly, the Legislature is presumed to have had knowledge of the definition of â€œpremisesâ€ contained in Â§ 58-67-210.[2]\r\nFairfield contends the trial courtâ€™s holding will effectively require continuous ownership of a premises, and prohibit cooperatives from serving premises they have historically served when those premises changes ownership.Â  We disagree with this contention.\r\nAs noted in City of Newberry, â€œalthough the annexation exception also implies consent for cooperatives to serve additional premises, i.e., new customers, within an annexed area, the statute expressly limits a cooperativeâ€™s authority to provide new or increased service by allowing it only until such time as the governing body of the city or town shall direct otherwise. . . .â€Â  352 S.C. at 576, 575 S.E.2d at 86.Â  It is clear that a co-operative may continue serving customers due to a change in ownership; the statute merely requires the coop to be serving a building, structure, or facility at the time of annexation.Â  \r\nFinally, we decline to hold that the security light placed by Town and Country is a â€œstructureâ€ within the contemplation of Â§ 33-49-250.Â  Such a holding would allow cooperative providers to effectively circumvent the statutory scheme set up by the Legislature simply by placing security lights in any areas in which it has distribution lines.Â  Such a result is untenable.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that Fairfield Electric Cooperative is without authority to serve the recently annexed Loweâ€™s property.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  At the time, Fairfield had a distribution line which crossed the property, and the city of Camden had a sewer easement.Â  \r\n[2]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1) was rewritten by 2004 Act No. 179, Â§ 5, effective February 19, 2004 and now provides that an electric cooperative has power to:\r\n\r\n  to generate, manufacture, purchase, acquire, accumulate, and transmit electric energy and to distribute, sell, supply, and dispose of electric energy to . . . persons. . . provided that the premises to be served must be located in an area a cooperative is permitted to serve pursuant to Section 58-27-610 through Section 58-27-670.\r\n\r\nSection 58-27-610 is the section of the Electric Cooperative Act which specifically defines â€œpremises.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26299","title":"State v.

Dudek, of the South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Lord Byron Slater (â€œSlaterâ€) was convicted of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Slater appealed his conviction and sentence to the court of appeals alleging that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  The court of appeals reversed Slaterâ€™s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.Â  See State v. Slater, 360 S.C. 487, 602 S.E.2d 90 (2004).Â Â  The State appealed and this Court granted a Writ of Certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nSlater attended a step show at North Charleston High School in February 2001.Â  After the step show ended, Slater went outside and began talking with some of the girls at the school.Â  During this time, Slater noticed a gathering around a truck.Â  Slater went to his car, retrieved a gun, and walked toward the truck.Â  According to Slater, he initially retrieved his gun with the intention of shooting it into the air to cause a commotion.Â  Slater alleges, however, that he changed his mind and returned to his car where three of his friends were waiting for him. Moments later, Slater noticed that another disturbance was taking place in an adjacent parking lot.Â  Carrying his gun with him, Slater went to the adjacent parking lot to investigate.Â Â Â  \r\nIn the second parking lot, a robbery was unfolding where the victim was on the ground being assaulted by five men.Â  Slater knew neither the victim nor his attackers.Â  Slater testified that he walked up to the robbery and surprised one of the attackers.Â  According to Slaterâ€™s testimony, the man turned around and pointed a gun toward him.Â  Slater quickly turned away from the man and started running back toward his car.Â  Slater also testified that as he ran, he heard a gunshot and responded by shooting his own gun behind him.Â  As Slater and his friends left the scene, Slater continued shooting in the air as the car pulled away and the victim lay dying on the ground from several gunshot wounds. Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSlater and his three friends drove to Slaterâ€™s house, where Slater left the gun.Â  The four then went back to the parking lot where the shooting had occurred.Â  On the way, the police stopped them and searched the car but did not find a weapon.\r\nEarly the next morning, detectives from the city of North Charleston went to Slaterâ€™s residence to arrest him for the murder of the victim.Â  Following the arrest, they obtained a search warrant for Slaterâ€™s house.Â  The detectives recovered various ammunitions from Slaterâ€™s yard and from inside his house, including two guns, bullets, and shell casings.\r\nAt the police station, Slater told the police that he had not shot anyone.Â  However, a ballistics expert testified at trial that the bullets which fatally wounded the victim came from Slaterâ€™s gun, as did the ones retrieved from the crime scene.Â  Additionally, numerous witnesses placed Slater at the crime scene with a gun.Â  At trial, Slater himself admitted to shooting his gun, but insisted that he did not mean to shoot anyone.Â  \r\nBefore the case was submitted to the jury, Slater requested a jury charge on the law of self-defense.Â  The trial court declined Slaterâ€™s request on the grounds that the evidence did not support the charge.Â  Despite the trial courtâ€™s refusal to include the jury charge on self-defense, the court included a manslaughter option in the jury charge.Â  The jury convicted Slater of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and Slater appealed.\r\nAt the court of appeals, Slater alleged that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on the law of self-defense. The court of appeals agreed and reversed Slaterâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s Writ of Certiorari, and the State raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\nÂ Did the court of appeals err in finding that Slater was entitled to a charge on self-defense? \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nThe State argues that the court of appeals erred in finding that Slater was entitled to a self-defense charge.Â  We agree.\r\nA self-defense charge is not required unless it is supported by the evidence. State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994).Â  To establish self-defense in South Carolina, four elements must be present: (1) the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) the defendant must have been in actual imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he must have actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) if his defense is based upon his belief of imminent danger, defendant must show that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the belief that he was actually in imminent danger and that the circumstances were such as would warrant a person of ordinary prudence, firmness, and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or the loss of his life; and (4) the defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.Â  State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 344-45, 520 S.E.2d 319, 321-22 (1999).Â Â  â€œIf there is any evidence in the record from which it could reasonably be inferred that the defendant acted in self-defense, the defendant is entitled to instructions on the defense, and the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to do so is reversible error.â€Â  State v. Muller, 282 S.C. 10, 10, 316 S.E.2d 409, 409 (1984).\r\nIn the instant case, Slater fails to meet the first requirement for the self-defense charge: specifically, Slater was not without fault in bringing on the difficulty.Â  â€œAny act of the accused in violation of law and reasonably calculated to produce the occasion amounts to bringing on the difficulty and bars the right to assert self-defense.â€Â  Bryant, 336 S.C. at 345, 520 S.E.2d at 322.Â  In the instant case, the record clearly reflects that Slater approached an altercation that was already underway with a loaded weapon by his side.Â  Such activity could be reasonably calculated to bring the difficulty that arose in this case.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the uncontradicted evidence illustrates that Slater acted in violation of the law by carrying a weapon.Â  The court of appeals relied on State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999), to support its finding that Slaterâ€™s unlawful possession of a weapon did not foreclose the possibility of asserting self-defense.Â  Although we agree that â€œthe mere unlawful possession of a firearm, with nothing more, does not automatically bar a self-defense charge,â€ we reject the position that the unlawful possession of a weapon could never constitute an unlawful activity which would preclude the assertion of self-defense.Â Â  \r\n Burriss, which deals with the defense of accident, is instructive in the instant case.Â  In Burriss, this Court discussed the use of an accident defense where the defendant unlawfully possessed a gun.Â Â  Burriss maintained that he was lawfully armed in self-defense when the gun accidentally fired.Â  Id. at 259, 513 S.E.2d at 106.Â Â  Because a defendant must be acting lawfully to use the defense of accident, we discussed whether a person in unlawful possession of a weapon may lawfully arm himself in self-defense.Â  Id. at 262, 513 S.E.2d at 108.Â  Clarifying an ambiguity in this Courtâ€™s prior case law, we noted that where the defendantâ€™s unlawful possession of a weapon is merely incidental to the defendantâ€™s lawful act of arming himself in self-defense, the unlawful possession of the weapon will not prevent the use of an accident defense.Â  Id. at 262 n.5, 513 S.E.2d at 108 n.5.Â  We further explained, however, that the unlawful possession of a firearm can, under some circumstances, constitute an unlawful activity so as to preclude an accident defense if the weapon is the proximate cause of the killing.Â  Id.Â  Although Burriss takes the additional step of applying the rule in the context of accident, the analysis is equally applicable in determining if a defendant in unlawful possession of a weapon is entitled to a charge on self-defense.Â  \r\nHere, Slaterâ€™s unlawful possession of the weapon was the proximate cause of the homicide. Â Slater was not merely in unlawful possession of a weapon; he carried the cocked weapon, in open view, into an already violent attack in which he had no prior involvement.Â  Slaterâ€™s actions, including the unlawful possession of the weapon, proximately caused the exchange of gunfire, and ultimately the death of the victim.Â  Consequently, Slater fails to meet the requirement that he be without fault in bringing on the difficulty and may not avail himself of a charge on self-defense.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court correctly found that Slater was not entitled to a self-defense charge and the court of appeals erred in reversing Slaterâ€™s conviction on this ground. \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision reversing the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of a jury charge on the law of self-defense.\r\n MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26300","title":"In the Matter of Kenneth S.

Accordingly, we accept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26302","title":"Key Corporate Capital v.

Capital, Inc. v. County of Beaufort, 360 S.C. 513, 602 S.E.2d 104 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1998 and 1999, respondents Key Corporate Capital, Inc., National Tax Assistance Corporation, and TransAm Tax Certificate Corporation purchased several properties at Beaufort County tax sales. Â The Beaufort County Treasurer subsequently voided twelve of these tax sales.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-150 (2000).[1]  \r\nThe parties stipulated to the following facts:Â  (1) the tax sales were voided because the Treasurer discovered â€œerrors, oversights, and/or miscommunications within the Beaufort County offices;â€ (2) the tax sales were not voided â€œdue to any actions or inactions on the part ofâ€ respondents; (3) the tax sales would have been set aside by a court if the Treasurer had not voided them;Â  (4) the County retained the purchase price on each property for at least 28 days, and for three of the properties, the funds were held for over a year; (5) the Treasurerâ€™s Office refunded the full purchase price to respondents; and (6) the County earned a 6% rate of interest on respondentsâ€™ funds with an actual earned amount of $28,010.93 in interest.\r\nSeeking the interest their money earned while in the Countyâ€™s possession, respondents brought suit against the County of Beaufort, the Treasurer of Beaufort County, and the Tax Collector of Beaufort County (collectively â€œpetitionersâ€ or â€œthe Countyâ€).Â  One of respondentsâ€™ theories for relief was unjust enrichment.Â  Petitioners answered, asserting that respondents were limited to the statutory remedy.Â  The master-in-equity heard the matter and ruled in favor of respondents.Â  Specifically, the master found that:Â  (1) the applicable statute, section 12-51-150, was silent as to interest; and (2) applying the rules of equity, petitioners would be unjustly enriched if they retained the interest earned on respondentsâ€™ funds when it was petitionersâ€™ errors that caused them to void the tax sales.Â  Therefore, the master awarded respondents actual damages of $28,010.93.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Key Corp., supra.Â  First, the Court of Appeals found that section 12-51-150â€™s silence on the subject of interest did not â€œentitle[] the County to retain the interest.â€Â  Key Corp., 360 S.C. at 516, 602 S.E.2d at 106.Â  The Court of Appeals then reasoned that because other sections within Chapter 51 specifically address interest,[2] the Legislatureâ€™s omission regarding interest in section 12-51-150 required that the rules of equity be applied.Â  Like the master-in-equity, the Court of Appeals found â€œit would be unjust to allow the County to keep the interest on the purchase prices of tax sales that were voided due to the Countyâ€™s own errors and omissions;â€ therefore, the Court of Appeals concluded that respondents were entitled to the interest actually earned while in the Countyâ€™s possession.Â  Id. at 519-20, 602 S.E.2d at 107-08.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the award of interest to respondents?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioners argue that the Court of Appeals erred in not following the plain and unambiguous language of section 12-51-150 which, at the relevant time, provided only for a return of the â€œamount paidâ€ to the successful bidder when a tax sale is voided.Â  Petitioners further contend it was error to apply the principles of equity because the statute provided an adequate remedy at law, i.e., the refund of the purchase price paid by the bidder.Â  We agree with both these arguments.Â  \r\nThe sale of the property of a defaulting taxpayer is governed by statute.Â  Durham v. United Cos. Fin. Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 603, 503 S.E.2d 465, 467 (1998).Â  â€œIf a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 276, 625 S.E.2d 636, 640 (2006) (internal quotes and citation omitted).Â  Instead, the words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation. Â Id.Â  Moreover, â€œit is beyond this Courtâ€™s power to effect a change in the statutes enacted by the Legislature.â€Â  State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 120, 529 S.E.2d 20, 27 (2000); see also Keyserling v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 86, 470 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1996) (this Court does â€œnot sit as a superlegislature to second guess the wisdom or folly of decisions of the General Assemblyâ€).\r\nWe need not go any further than the plain language of section 12-51-150 to determine that it was error to award respondents the earned interest. Â At the time in question, this statute provided a clear remedy if a tax sale was voided - a â€œrefundâ€ of â€œthe amount paidâ€ to the successful bidder.Â  If the Legislature had intended the County to earn and then refund interest, it could easily have specified these requirements in the statute as it did in sections 12-51-100 and 12-51-130.Â  See footnote 2, supra.\r\nIndeed, the Legislature amended this section just last year to expressly provide that when a tax sale is voided, the purchaser would be provided a refund plus actual interest earned.Â  Section 12-51-150 now reads as follows, in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\r\nIf the official in charge of the tax sale discovers before a tax title has passed that there is a failure of any action required to be properly performed, the official may void the tax sale and refund the amount paid, plus interest in the amount actually earned by the county on the amount refunded, to the successful bidder.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-150 (Supp. 2006) (emphasized language effective June 14, 2006).\r\nWe have long acknowledged the presumption that in adopting an amendment to a statute, the Legislature intended to change the existing law. Â See Vernon v. Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., 244 S.C. 152, 155, 135 S.E.2d 841, 844 (1964); see also North River Ins. Co. v. Gibson, 244 S.C. 393, 398, 137 S.E.2d 264, 266 (1964) (where the Court recognized â€œthe rule of construction that the adoption of an amendment which materially changes the terminology of a statute ... raises a presumption that a departure from the original law was intendedâ€); Hyde v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 314 S.C. 207, 210, 442 S.E.2d 582, 583 (1994) (Toal, J., dissenting) (â€œWhere a statute has been amended, there is a presumption that the legislature intended to change the law.â€).[3]\r\nWe see no reason not to apply this presumption and therefore conclude that the Legislatureâ€™s amendment to section 12-51-150 sought to effect a change in the law.Â  Because the amendment materially changed the terminology of the statute, a departure from existing law clearly was intended, rather than a clarification of original intent.Â  See North River Ins. Co. v. Gibson, supra. Â In fact, to hold otherwise would indicate that this amendment essentially was a futile act, which we are disinclined to do.Â  See Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 212, 574 S.E.2d 196, 198 (2002) (â€œThe Court must presume the legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather intended its statutes to accomplish something.â€); TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998) (same).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the plain language of the prior version of section 12-51-150 clearly limits respondentsâ€™ remedy to a refund of the purchase price without interest.\r\nMoreover, we find it was error to fashion an equitable remedy in this case.Â  While equitable relief is generally available where there is no adequate remedy at law, an adequate legal remedy may be provided by statute.Â  Santee Cooper Resort, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 298 S.C. 179, 185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1989). Â Indeed, a â€œcourtâ€™s equitable powers must yield in the face of an unambiguously worded statute.â€Â  Id.Â  There is simply nothing inadequate about the remedy of a full refund provided by the plain language of the prior version of section 12-51-150; hence, there was no reason for the lower courts to resort to equity principles.\r\nFinally, as to respondentsâ€™ argument that an equitable remedy is justified by the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in H &amp; K Specialists v. Brannen, 340 S.C. 585, 532 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 2000), we simply disagree.Â  In H &amp; K Specialists, the Court of Appeals held that section 12-51-100[4] applied to the case because the tax sale was set aside in a later court action.Â  The Court of Appeals deemed the master-in-equityâ€™s return of the property to the delinquent taxpayers â€œas the ultimate redemptionâ€ thereby triggering section 12-51-100â€™s remedy of the return of the purchase price plus interest to the successful bidder.Â  Id. at 588, 532 S.E.2d at 619. Â While the Court of Appeals did note that the Countyâ€™s errors and omissions created the â€œinequitable situationâ€ present in the case,[5] this does not establish that the Court of Appeals fashioned an equitable remedy in favor of the appellant.Â  Id. at 589, 532 S.E.2d at 620. Â On the contrary, the Court of Appeals merely held that the setting aside of the tax sale was tantamount to a redemption which triggered section 12-51-100 and the remedy contained therein.Â  In the instant case, however, there is no question that the applicable statute is section 12-51-150 which, in its previous form, did not provide the successful bidder with interest on the purchase price.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we hold that the version of section 12-51-150 in effect at the relevant time only required the County, upon voiding the tax sales, to refund the purchase price, and not the interest, to respondents.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision, but remand the case for a determination of the appropriate amount Beaufort County must disgorge as a result of its unjust enrichment.\r\nA court may grant equitable relief where there is no adequate remedy at law.Â  Santee Cooper Resort, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 298 S.C. 179, 185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1989).Â  An adequate remedy at law is one which provides the plaintiff with â€œthe full end and justice of the case. It is not enough that there is some remedy at law, but that remedy must be as practical, efficient, and prompt as the remedy in equity.â€Â \r\nChisolm v. Pryor, 207 S.C. 54, 60, 35 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1945) (internal citations omitted).Â Â  \r\nâ€œRestitution is a remedy designed to prevent unjust enrichment.â€Â  Stanley Smith &amp; Sons v. Limestone College, 283 S.C. 430, 435 n.1, 322 S.E.2d 474, 478 n.1 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  To recover on a theory of restitution, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he conferred a non-gratuitous benefit on the defendant, (2) the defendant realized some value from the benefit, and (3) it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying the plaintiff for its value. Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003).\r\nThe majority finds that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-150 (2000) provided the Respondentâ€™s with an adequate remedy at law.Â  Although I agree that the statute provides some remedy for the Respondents, I do not find the remedy adequate because it is neither practical, complete, nor efficient.Â  While the statute mandates the return of the amount paid by the bidder, the statute fails to provide complete relief to the Respondents who, through no fault of their own, have been denied the use of their funds.Â  The interpretation propounded by the majority provides little incentive for the County to resolve its mistakes in a timely fashion, and instead, encourages the County to indefinitely hold funds which rightfully belong to the bidder.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHere, the Respondents gave the County money in exchange for the title to real property.Â  Although the County failed to deliver title for the real property to the Respondents, the County retained the money and utilized the funds to earn interest. Clearly, this constitutes a non-gratuitous benefit for which the County received some value.Â  Surely it is inequitable for the County to retain these benefits without compensating the Respondents for their value.\r\nThe County argues that no inequity occurred because the Respondents had actual notice that interest would not be given in the event the tax sale was voided.Â  However, in my opinion, the notice provided to the bidders refers to the statutory interest payments bidders normally receive if a property is redeemed by the taxpayer, see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-100 (2000), and not the interest the County earns on the funds through a deposit account or other similar investment.Â  While it is reasonable that the County should not pay statutory interest that it has not received through redemption, it is unreasonable and inequitable to allow the County to retain interest earned on funds which rightfully belonged to the Respondents.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, the majority holds that the legislature intended to prohibit the return of any interest earned on bid money retained by the County because the statute is silent on the issue of interest and the legislature could have included such language in Â§ 12-51-150 as it has in other statutes.Â Â Â  I disagree.\r\nFirst, I would find that the statuteâ€™s silence regarding the return of interest is ambiguous and does not clearly demonstrate legislative intent to prohibit the return of such interest.Â  This Court has acknowledged that â€œsubsequent legislation may be of service as indicating the construction given to the former by the legislature itself.â€Â  Abell v. Bell, 229 S.C. 1, 5, 91 S.E.2d 548, 550 (1956) (internal citations omitted).Â  Furthermore, this Court recognizes: \r\n\r\nthe rule of construction that the adoption of an amendment which materially changes the terminology of a statute under some circumstances indicates persuasively and raises a presumption that a departure from the original law was intended. Â However, like all rules of construction, the presumption is merely an aid in interpreting an ambiguous statute and determining the legislative intent. Â The presumption is strongest â€œin the case of an isolated independent amendment. . . and. . . is of little force in respect of amendments adopted in a general revision or codification of the laws.â€\r\n\r\nNorth River Ins. Co. v. Gibson, 244 S.C. 393, 398, 137 S.E.2d 264, 266 (1964) (holding that the legislatureâ€™s modification of language in a statute accomplished by general revision of the laws indicated the legislatureâ€™s intent to clarify the existing law and not to materially change the existing law).\r\nThe legislature recently revised Â§ 12-51-150 to include additional language requiring a county that voids a tax sale to also relinquish the amount of interest actually earned on the amount paid by the bidder.Â  See Act No. 386, 2006 S.C. Acts 3077.Â  Like the statute at issue in Gibson, Â§12-51-150 was modified through an act which provided a general revision to many statutes in our Code of Laws.Â  Because the modification of the statute was accomplished through an act of general revision and not an isolated independent amendment, I would hold that the revision by the legislature indicated its intent to clarify the statute as opposed to an intent to materially modify the law.Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSecond, I find the majorityâ€™s reliance on the fact that the legislature could have included language requiring the return of interest in Â§ 12-51-150 as it had in other statutes inconsequential.Â  Both Â§Â§ 12-51-100 and -130 refer to situations distinctly different from the one at hand.Â  As I have discussed, Â§ 12-51-100 clearly refers to the statutory interest provided by Â§ 12-51-90.Â  Section 12-51-130, on the other hand, allows the County to retain interest earned on money which it rightfully possesses due to the failure of the defaulting taxpayer or owner of record to claim the funds in a timely fashion.Â  Therefore, in my opinion, the legislatureâ€™s discussion of interest in these statutes provides no indication of its intent to prohibit the relinquishment of interest pursuant to Â§12-51-150.Â  These statutes simply address interest in different contexts.Â Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the court of appeals and allow the Respondents to maintain an action against the County for restitution. However, in recognition of the unintentional nature of the Countyâ€™s mistake and the costs associated with carrying out these types of transactions, I believe that the equitable remedy of restitution only allows the Respondents to recover the amount in which the County was unjustly enriched.Â Â  Therefore, I would remand the case to the trial court with instructions to determine the amount of unjust enrichment the County must disgorge.Â Â Â  \r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] The version of section 12-51-150 relevant to the instant action states as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the case that the official in charge of the tax sale discovers before a tax title has passed, the failure of any action required to be properly performed, the official may void the tax sale and refund the amount paid to the successful bidder.Â  If the full amount of the taxes, assessments, penalties, and costs have not been paid, the property must be brought to tax sale as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-150 (2000) (emphasis added).Â  As will be discussed infra, this statutory section was recently amended to also provide to the successful bidder any interest earned on the purchase price.Â  See 2006 S.C. Act No. 386, effective June 14, 2006.\r\n[2] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-100 (where the defaulting taxpayer redeems the property, the successful bidder at the tax sale is entitled to be â€œrefunded the purchase price plus the interestâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-130 (County is directed to invest amounts paid at a tax sale that exceed the amount owed by delinquent taxpayer in a separate account â€œso as not to be idle,â€ and if taxpayer does not claim the overage within the specified time period, County is entitled to both the overage and â€œthe earnings for keeping the overageâ€).\r\n[3] But see Stuckey v. State Budget and Control Bd., 339 S.C. 397, 401, 529 S.E.2d 706, 708 (2000) (â€œA subsequent statutory amendment may be interpreted as clarifying original legislative intent.â€).Â  \r\n[4] This section, entitled â€œCancellation of sale upon redemption; notice to purchaser; refund of purchase price,â€ states:\r\n\r\nUpon the real estate being redeemed, the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall cancel the sale in the tax sale book and note thereon the amount paid, by whom and when. Â The successful purchaser, at the delinquent tax sale, shall promptly be notified by mail to return the tax sale receipt to the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes in order to be expeditiously refunded the purchase price plus the interest provided in Section 12-51-90.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-100 (2000).\r\n[5] The County failed to provide the delinquent taxpayers with proper notice, which led to the tax sale being set aside by the master, and then erroneously refunded the purchase price to the delinquent taxpayers instead of the successfully bidder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26304","title":"Burgess v.

App. 2004).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nBurgess was injured in a motor vehicle accident while operating his motorcycle, which was insured by Alpha Property and Casualty Insurance Company.Â  Burgessâ€™s damages exceeded the at-fault driverâ€™s coverage, and Burgess had no UIM coverage on the motorcycle.Â  He did, however, own three other vehicles insured by Nationwide, each of which had $25,000 in UIM coverage.\r\nNationwide declined Burgessâ€™ UIM claim, relying on this policy provision:\r\n\r\n3.&nbsp; If a vehicle owned by you or a relative is involved in an accident where you or a relative sustains bodily injury or property damage, this policy shall:\r\n  \r\na)&nbsp; be primary if the involved vehicle is your auto described on this policy; or\r\nb)&nbsp; be excess if the involved vehicle is not your auto described on this policy.Â  The amount of coverage applicable under this policy shall be the lesser of the coverage limits under this policy or the coverage limits on the vehicle involved in the accident.\r\n(Emphasis supplied).\r\n  \r\n\r\nBurgess brought this declaratory judgment action, and the circuit court held that Nationwide must pay Burgess $15,000 in UIM benefits under one of its policies insuring Burgessâ€™ â€œat-homeâ€ vehicles.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and we granted Nationwideâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the Court of Appeals was correct when it concluded Nationwideâ€™s policy provision purporting to limit the portability UIM coverage is void because it violates S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002)?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Court of Appeals first held that UIM, like uninsured motorist (UM) coverage, is â€œpersonal and portable,â€ that is, the coverage follows the individual insured and not the insured vehicle.Â  See Hogan v. Home Ins. Co., 260 S.C. 157, 162, 194 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1973) (â€œunlike the provisions relative to liability coverage, the statute plainly affords uninsured motorist coverage to the named insured and resident relatives of his or her household at all times and without regard to the activity in which they were engaged at the time.Â  Such coverage is nowhere limited by the statute to the use of the insured vehicleâ€).\r\nThe Court of Appeals then analyzed the impact of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 on the issue of the policy provisionâ€™s validity.Â  In relevant part, this statute provides:\r\n\r\nAutomobile insurance carriers shall offer, at the option of the insured, uninsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insuredâ€™s liability coverage in addition to the mandatory coverage prescribed by Section 38-77-150.Â  Such carriers shall also offer, at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage in the event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault insured or underinsured motorist or in excess of any damages cap or limitation imposed by statute.Â  If, however, an insured or named insured is protected by uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage in excess of the basic limits, the policy shall provide that the insured or named insured is protected only to the extent of the coverage he has on the vehicle involved in the accident.Â \r\n â€¦.\r\n(bold in Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion).\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held the â€œIf, howeverâ€ sentence in Â§ 38-77-160 applied only to stacking cases, found the issue here was not stacking but rather Nationwideâ€™s attempt to â€œexclude basic UIM coverage in a situation where the vehicle involved in the collision is owned by the insured but not specifically covered by a UIM policy,â€ and concluded that nothing in the statute permitted an insurer to exclude basic UIM coverage under these circumstances.Â  Furthermore, the court held that the endorsement purporting to preclude Burgessâ€™s recovery of basic UIM was void as against public policy because Â§ 38-77-160 only permits an insurer to limit excess UIM coverage.\r\nWe begin by noting that we agree with the Court of Appeals that, as a general proposition, UIM coverage follows the individual insured rather than the vehicle insured, that is, UIM coverage, like UM, is â€œpersonal and portable.â€Â  See Hogan v. Home Ins. Co., supra.Â  Further, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the â€œIf, howeverâ€ sentence in Â§ 38-77-160, relied upon by Nationwide here, does not literally apply to these facts since Burgess is not attempting to stack excess UIM coverage from his Nationwide policy.[1]Â  In our view, however, this statutory language does provide support for Nationwideâ€™s contention that its policy provision does not violate public policy.Â  The â€œIf, howeverâ€ sentence in Â§ 38-77-160 evinces the legislatureâ€™s intent, in a stacking situation, to bind the insured to the amount of UIM coverage he chose to purchase in the policy covering the vehicle involved in the accident.Â  Thus, the statute itself contains a limit on the â€œportabilityâ€ of UIM coverage. \r\nNeither Â§ 38-77-160 nor our prior decisions decide the issue presented here: Is public policy offended by an automobile insurance policy provision that limits basic UIM portability when an insured is involved in an accident while in a vehicle he owns, but does not insure under the policy?Â  We find it is not.Â  UIM coverage is entirely voluntary, and permits insureds, at their option, to purchase insurance coverage for situations where they are injured by an at-fault driver who does not carry sufficient liability insurance to cover the insuredsâ€™ damages.Â  Essentially, the insured is buying insurance coverage for situations, as where he is a passenger in anotherâ€™s vehicle or is a pedestrian, where he cannot otherwise insure himself.Â  When, however, the insured is driving his own vehicle, he has the ability to decide whether to purchase voluntary UIM coverage.Â  Burgess chose not to do so when insuring his motorcycle.\r\nAn automobile insurance company, in setting its rates, bases those rates at least in part on the probabilities involving the insured and the vehicle(s) he is insuring.Â  Where, as here, the vehicle is not insured by the company from whom coverage is sought, the carrier cannot accurately calculate its risks.Â  It is one thing to insure against â€œunknowableâ€ risks, such as the chance that one will be injured by an underinsured at-fault driver while a passenger in anotherâ€™s vehicle, or as a pedestrian; it is an entirely different calculus where a companyâ€™s insured owns and operates a motor vehicle, especially a motorcycle, not insured by the carrier making its risk assessments.\r\nWe hold that public policy is not offended by an automobile insurance policy provision which limits the portability of basic â€œat-homeâ€ UIM coverage when the insured has a vehicle involved in the accident.Â  Compare State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 530 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000) (endorsement providing for set-off of workersâ€™ compensation benefits for UIM valid where UIM set-off is not, because UIM coverage is voluntary).Â  Upholding this limit on portability encourages persons to purchase UIM insurance on all their vehicles.Â  To hold, as did the Court of Appeals, that basic UIM is portable even in this situation permits an individual who owns multiple vehicles to purchase UIM insurance on only one vehicle, yet have basic UIM coverage on all.Â  We find this result undesirable.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals requiring Nationwide to provide Burgess with $15,000 UIM benefits is\r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Stacking is defined â€œas the insuredâ€™s recovery of damages under more than one policy until all of his damages are satisfied or the limits of all available policies are met.â€Â  Giles v. Whitaker, 297 S.C. 267, 376 S.E.2d 278 (1989).Â  Since Burgess seeks recovery under only one policy, technically he is not seeking to stack coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26305","title":"Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company v.

Ins. Co. v. Erwood, 364 S.C. 1, 611 S.E.2d 319 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nErwood was a passenger on an uninsured motorcycle owned and driven by her husband when he had an accident.Â  Erwoodâ€™s husband was at-fault in the accident.Â  Erwood owned an automobile insured by Nationwide under a policy providing $15,000 in UM coverage.Â  She sought to recover under the UM provision of her Nationwide policy, but Nationwide denied her claim.\r\nNationwide brought this declaratory judgment action, and the circuit court granted it summary judgment.Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, citing Burgess v. Nationwide Mut Ins. Co., 361 S.C. 196, 603 S.E.2d 861 (Ct. App. 2004) reversed Op. No. 26304 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 9, 2007).Â  Although we do not find Burgess, which concerned a policy limitation on the portability of underinsured (UIM) coverage, controls this case, we affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals here.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether an automobile insurance policy limiting basic UM coverage is void as against public policy?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nErwood was injured while a passenger on an uninsured motorcycle owned by her spouse.Â  Nationwide relied upon this policy provision to deny Erwoodâ€™s claim:\r\n\r\n3.&nbsp; If a vehicle owned by you or a relative is involved in an accident where you or a relative sustains bodily injury or property damage, this policy shall:\r\n  \r\na)&nbsp; be primary if the involved vehicle is your auto described on this policy; or\r\nb)&nbsp; be excess if the involved vehicle is not your auto described on this policy.Â  The amount of coverage applicable under this policy shall be the lesser of the coverage limits under this policy or the coverage limits on the vehicle involved in the accident.\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held, as it had in Burgess, that UM coverage is â€œpersonal and portable,â€ that is, it follows the insured and not the vehicle.Â  We agree.Â  See e.g., Hogan v. Home Ins. Co., 260 S.C. 157, 162, 194 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1973) (â€œunlike the provisions relative to liability coverage, the statute plainly affords uninsured motorist coverage to the named insured and resident relatives of his or her household at all times and without regard to the activity in which they were engaged at the time.Â  Such coverage is nowhere limited by the statute to the use of the insured vehicleâ€).\r\nThe court also held that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002) does not permit an automobile insurance company to exclude or restrict basic UM coverage.Â  Unlike the Court of Appeals, however, we conclude that the controlling statute is not Â§ 38-77-160, which covers stacking claims,[1] but rather the statute referred to in Hogan, which is now found at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 (Supp. 2002).Â  Section 38-77-150 mandates UM coverage in all automobile insurance policies.Â  We find that the mandatory nature of this coverage distinguishes it from the voluntary UIM coverage at issue in Burgess, and that pubic policy requires that basic UM coverage be afforded to Erwood even when she is a passenger on her spouseâ€™s uninsured motorcycle.[2]Â  Compare State Farm Mut Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 530 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000) (insurance policy endorsement providing for set-off of workerâ€™s compensation benefits for UIM valid where UM set-off is not, because UIM coverage is voluntary).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm, as modified, the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision holding that Erwood is entitled to collect basic UM benefits under her Nationwide policy.\r\nAffirmed as Modified.\r\n MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., and BURNETT, J., dissenting in separate opinions.\r\nChief Justice Toal: I respectfully dissent.Â  I would hold that uninsured motorist coverage is not â€œportableâ€ for a party who is injured while operating or while a passenger of a vehicle of which the party would be an insured had he or she purchased insurance coverage.Â  \r\nJust as it does in the context of underinsured motorist coverage, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002) contains a limitation on just how â€œpersonal and portableâ€ uninsured motorist coverage can be.Â  We recognized this limitation and made good use of it in deciding that an insured may not apply underinsured coverage from an insurance policy covering one vehicle to a separate policy, covering a separate vehicle, under which the insured declined the insurance companyâ€™s offer of such coverage.Â  See Burgess v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., Op. No. 26304 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 9, 2007).Â  In reaching that decision, we noted that â€œ[u]pholding this limit on portability encourages persons to purchase UIM insurance on all their vehicles.â€Â  Id.Â  Because this situation is no different, and because the public policy concerns are identical, I see no need to retreat from that holding in the instant case.[3]\r\nI think the majority rightly expresses concern at the thought that under similar logic to that used in the court of appealsâ€™ decision, an owner of an uninsured vehicle involved in an accident could be entitled to use uninsured motorist coverage from a separate vehicle to recover for his or her injuries.Â  Undeniably, this result would be absurd.Â  Instead, the owner of multiple vehicles who chooses to insure only one with uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage ought to be precluded from recovering basic UM and UIM limits on any of his or her vehicles for which he or she has not purchased this coverage.Â  In my view, this is the precise concern that drove us to hold as we did in Burgess, and by holding as the majority does in the instant case, we chip away at that foundation.\r\nAlthough I appreciate the view expressed by my brother Justice Burnett in dissent, I believe it is far too late in the day to argue that the language of an insurance contract is the end of the inquiry in these cases.Â  See Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 6, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993) (noting that statutory provisions relating to insurance contracts have long been held by this Court to be part of these contracts).Â  Because the court of appeals found a provision of the contract in the instant case was contrary to public policy and therefore void, we must necessarily proceed beyond the terms of the contract in our analysis.\r\nFor the reasons I have outlined, I would reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision and find that Respondent is not entitled to basic uninsured motorist coverage from her automobile insured by Nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNETT, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, it is unnecessary to address either S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002) or the personal and portable nature of UM coverage for the language of the insurance contract itself provides no coverage for Erwood.\r\nThe construction of an agreement is a matter of contract law. Â McDuffie v. McDuffie, 313 S.C. 397, 399, 438 S.E.2d 239, 241 (1993).Â  The primary objective in construing a contract is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties. Â Williams v. Teran, Inc., 266 S.C. 55, 59, 221 S.E.2d 526, 528 (1976).Â  The Court must first look at the language of the contract in order to determine the intention of the parties.Â  Superior Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 263, 199 S.E.2d 719, 722 (1973).Â Â  If its language is plain,\r\nunambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation, no construction is required and the\r\ncontractâ€™s language determines the instrumentâ€™s force and effect.Â  Blakely v. Rabon, 266 S.C. 68, 72, 221 S.E.2d 767, 769 (1976).Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œWhen a contract is unambiguous, clear and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used, to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary and popular sense.â€Â Â  C.A.N. Enter., Inc. v. South Carolina Health and Human Serv. Fin. Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 377-378, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586&nbsp;(1988) (quoting Warner v. Weader, 280 S.C. 81, 83, 311 S.E.2d 78, 79 (1983)). Â â€œ[I]t is not the function of this Court to rewrite it or torture the meaning of a policy to extend coverage never intended by the parties.â€Â  Torrington Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,&nbsp;264 S.C. 636, 643, 216 S.E.2d 547, 550&nbsp;(1975).\r\n\r\nErwood entered into an insurance contract with Nationwide.Â  The insurance contract applied to any vehicle owned by her or her relative and contemplated the involvement or ownership of an uninsured vehicle.Â  As noted by the majority, the pertinent portion of Erwoodâ€™s insurance contract states:\r\n\r\n3.&nbsp; If a vehicle owned by you or a relative is involved in an&nbsp;accident where you or a relative sustains bodily injury or property damage, this policy shall: \r\n  \r\na)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be primary if the involved vehicle is your auto described on this policy; or \r\nb)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be excess if the involved vehicle is not your auto described on this policy.Â  The amount of coverage applicable under this policy shall be the lesser of the coverage limits under this policy or the coverage limits on the vehicle involved in the accident.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSubsection (a) of the policy is inapplicable because the involved vehicle was uninsured.Â  Subsection (b), therefore, applies to limit the amount of coverage available.Â  The amount of coverage applicable under subsection (b) is the lesser of coverage limits under Erwoodâ€™s policy or the coverage limits on the vehicle involved in the accident.Â  The vehicle involved in the accident was uninsured.Â  Thus, the clear and unambiguous language of this provision does not provide any coverage for Erwood.Â  When the language of a policy is â€œplain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation,â€ it must be given full force and effect.Â  See Blakely, 266 S.C. at 72, 221 S.E.2d at 769.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Since Erwood is not seeking to stack insurance coverage, we are not concerned by her status as a Class I insured.\r\n[2] We do not decide whether basic UM coverage is universal, such that the owner of an uninsured vehicle involved in the accident would be entitled to basic UM coverage from an at-home vehicle.Â  We are troubled by the thought that a person operating a vehicle without insurance in violation of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act would be allowed to collect benefits from the insurer of another of the owner/operatorâ€™s vehicles.\r\n[3] In reaching this conclusion, I note that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7) (2002) defines an insured as both the named insured and, if a resident of the same household, the spouse of the named insured.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26306","title":"Carolina Water Service, Inc. v.

(collectively Appellants) appeal the dismissal of their action against Charles Cousins, in his capacity as Director of Planning of the Town of Hilton Head Island, and Island Cabaret, Inc.Â  We certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and we affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nConnor Holdings currently owns a commercial building located at #1 Dunnaganâ€™s Alley in the Town of Hilton Head Island (Town).Â  Connor Holdings leases the building to MAL Entertainment, which operates an adult entertainment business.Â  In August and September 2002, MAL Entertainment filed a written complaint with Cousins in accordance with Townâ€™s Land Management Ordinance (LMO) Â§ 16-8-103(C).Â  MAL Entertainment asked Cousins to investigate whether Island Cabaret had a valid special exception to operate an adult entertainment business at 130 Arrow Road in the Town and further asked Cousins to prevent Island Cabaret from operating an adult entertainment business until the necessary special exception was obtained. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhen Cousins failed to respond to MAL Entertainmentâ€™s complaint, MAL Entertainment and Connor Holdings commenced this action against Cousins and Island Cabaret.Â  Appellants sought an injunction against Island Cabaret from establishing or reestablishing an adult entertainment use at 130 Arrow Road until Island Cabaret received a valid special exception as required by the LMO.Â  They also sought a writ of mandamus requiring Cousins to exercise his authority in accordance with the LMO as it related to Island Cabaretâ€™s establishment and operation of an adult entertainment business. \r\nAfter a hearing on the matter, the special referee found Connor Holdings and MAL Entertainment lacked standing and failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.Â  He also determined Cousins properly complied with the LMO and properly construed the LMO to find Island Cabaret had a valid special exception.Â  The special referee granted summary judgment in favor of Cousins and Island Cabaret.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the special referee err in granting summary judgment to Cousins Â  and Island Cabaret on the ground Appellants lacked standing?Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA lower court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the lower court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 385, 365 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the special referee erred in finding they lacked standing under LMO Â§ 16-8-105. Â We disagree.\r\nStanding to sue is a fundamental requirement in instituting an action.Â  Joytime Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 639, 528 S.E.2d 647, 649 (1999).Â  LMO Â§ 16-8-105 provides:\r\n\r\n  An adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be specially damaged by any violation may in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use, or to correct or abate the violation, or  to prevent the occupancy of the building, structure or land.Â  This is in addition to the right of the Town to bring an enforcement action.\r\n\r\nLMO Â§ 16-8-105 plainly gives an adjacent or neighboring property owner the right to bring an enforcement action when the property owner is specially damaged by certain violations of the LMO.Â  See Overcash v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 364 S.C. 569, 576, 614 S.E.2d 619, 622 (2005) (â€œThe main factor in determining whether a statute creates a private cause of action is legislative intent.â€).Â  \r\nConnor Holdings owns the property located at #1 Dunnaganâ€™s Alley and MAL Entertainment is its tenant.Â  Therefore, MAL Entertainment, as a tenant, lacks standing under LMO Â§ 16-8-105 to pursue this enforcement action.Â  \r\nAs a neighboring property owner, Connor Holdings may pursue this action if it is specially damaged.Â  Special damages in a zoning enforcement action generally are the diminution in the value of the plaintiffâ€™s property due to the violating use.Â  See Momeier v. John McAlister, Inc., 203 S.C. 353, 359, 27 S.E.2d 504, 511 (1943) (finding a material depreciation in the value of the plaintiffâ€™s property constituted special damages in a zoning enforcement case); Bell v. Bennett, 307 S.C. 286, 295, 414 S.E.2d 786, 791-92 (Ct. App. 1992); (finding the master-in-equity properly dismissed defendantâ€™s claim that plaintiff failed to comply with a zoning ordinance because defendant failed to plead or prove his property value was diminished by plaintiffâ€™s violating use).Â  Connor Holdings, however, does not allege a diminution in the value of its property.Â  Rather, Connor Holdings alleges, in an affidavit, its special damages include adverse affects to its economic and property interests and a transformation of its adult entertainment use from conforming to nonconforming due to Island Cabaretâ€™s operation.Â  \r\nAlthough this Court has not addressed whether a loss in profits due to competition constitutes special damages, the theory has been consistently rejected if increased competition is the sole basis for special damages.Â  See generally 4 Rathkopfâ€™s The Law of Zoning and Planning Â§ 63.34 (4th ed. 2005) (â€œ[G]enerally, persons whose only complaint is that the rezoning or grant of special permit or variance would create competition with them in the conduct of their business have been held not to have standing to litigate the validity of the zoning action.â€); 1 Am.Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 495 Â§ 7 (1988) (noting an owner of commercial property generally does not have standing if â€œspecial damages amount to a loss of business due to the position of the violating use as a competing business,â€ but commercial property owner may be specially damaged if he â€œallege[s] adverse impact on his business other than by increased competitionâ€).Â  Yet, Connor Holdings asserts the loss of profits from increased competition in conjunction with the change of its use from conforming to nonconforming constitutes special damages based on Skaggs-Albertsonâ€™s v. ABC Liquors, Inc., 363 So.2d 1082 (Fla. 1978).Â  \r\nIn Skaggs-Albertsonâ€™s, an owner of a liquor store objected to another liquor storeâ€™s violation of the zoning regulations.Â  The Florida Supreme Court acknowledged the general rule that â€œloss of business from a potential competitor ordinarily cannot provide the existing proprietor with the requisite standing.â€Â  363 So.2d at 1090.Â  The Court then noted, although other businesses were subject to regulation, the alcoholic beverage industry was subject to stringent government regulation.Â  The Court recognized the regulations restricted the number and proximity of liquor stores and the Court distinguished a liquor license, which is a form of property, from other types of licenses, which are not property.Â  Id.Â  Due to the unique regulation of the alcoholic beverage industry, the Court found the liquor store owner had standing on the basis of business competition.Â  Id.Â  \r\nConnor Holdingsâ€™ alleged special damages are distinguishable from those in Skaggs-Albertsonâ€™s.Â  Although Connor Holdings is subject to more regulations under the LMO if its use is nonconforming, Connor Holdings is not subject to the same type of stringent regulations as the liquor store owner in Skaggs-Albertsonâ€™s.Â  In addition, Connor Holdings has failed to prove any adverse impact on its economic interests other than due to increased competition or to its property interests.Â  We conclude Connor Holdings lacks standing to pursue this action because it failed to plead or prove any special damages.Â  Rule 9(g), SCRCP (â€œWhen items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.â€); Sheek v. Lee, 289 S.C. 327, 329, 345 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1986) (â€œSpecial damages must be alleged in the complaint to avoid surprise to the other party.â€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the special refereeâ€™s dismissal of the action based on Appellantsâ€™ lack of standing.Â  Based on the foregoing, we need not address Appellantsâ€™ remaining issues on appeal.Â  See Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711 (2005) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority.Â  I write separately, however, to address two curiosities in this case on the issue of standing.Â  \r\n In the federal courts, the requirements for what is commonly termed as â€œconstitutional standingâ€ have been relatively long-established.Â  These requirements provide that in order to maintain a cause of action, (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest (an â€œinjury in factâ€) which is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent; (2) there must be a causal connection between the plaintiffâ€™s injury and the conduct of which the plaintiff complains; and (3) it must be likely that the plaintiffâ€™s injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.Â  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-61 (1992).Â  We have used these boundaries of federal constitutional standing to outline the requirements of the minimum a plaintiff must show in order to bring an action in a South Carolina court.Â  E.g., Sea Pines Assâ€™n for Prot. of Wildlife, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594, 601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2001) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 559-61).\r\nI find the land management ordinance in this case interesting in two regards.Â  First, I would interpret the ordinanceâ€™s requirement that a neighboring landowner either sustain or be in danger of sustaining special damages as not bearing on the issue of standing.Â  Instead, I would hold that the requirement of special damages goes to the substantive adequacy of the neighborâ€™s claim.Â  The federal courts have adopted a rule providing that when a statutory limitation is not expressly characterized as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as non-jurisdictional in character.Â  See Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, Â­Â­__, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1245 (2006).Â  I would follow their lead.Â  Holding otherwise would require the neighbor in the instant case to effectively prove his case before he can go to court.\r\nBut this distinction reveals the second curiosity.Â  In essence, the land management ordinance at issue in this case authorizes a neighboring property owner to bring a lawsuit to prevent any action which may inflict upon him â€œspecial damages.â€Â  Failing to see how this ordinance does anything other than repeat the constitutional standing requirement of an â€œinjury in fact,â€ I would resolve the case on those grounds alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26308","title":"State v.

Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-40 (2003), which states:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    A person who aids in the commission of a felony or is an accessory before the fact in the commission of a felony by counseling, hiring, or otherwise procuring the felony to be committed is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be punished in the manner prescribed for the punishment of the principal felon.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe punishment prescribed for the principal felon, i.e. for murder, is that a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by death, by life imprisonment, or by a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of thirty years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (2003).Â  Therefore, a plain reading of Â§16-3-20(A) and Â§16-1-40 indicates that one who is charged with accessory before the fact to murder is clearly subject to the punishments of life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of thirty years because these are the punishments rendered when one is found guilty of murder.[3]Â  However, respondentâ€™s eligibility for the death penalty is not so clear.Â  A review of Â§ 16-3-20 is necessary to determine her eligibility.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (2003) states:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (A) A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by death, by imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years.Â  If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to subsections (B) and (C), and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment.Â  . . .\r\n    (B) When the State seeks the death penalty, upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant of murder, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding.Â  In the proceeding, if a statutory aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant must be sentenced to either death or life imprisonment.Â  If no statutory aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant must be sentenced to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years.Â  . . .\r\n    . . .Â  Unless at least one of the statutory aggravating circumstances enumerated in this section is found, the death penalty must not be imposed.\r\n      Where a statutory aggravating circumstance is found and a recommendation of death is made, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to death.Â  . . . Where a statutory aggravating circumstance is not found, the trial judge shall sentence the defendant to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  \r\nA possible sentence of death applies only when one is convicted of or has pled guilty to the crime of murder.Â  Following the plain language of Â§ 16-3-20, the State may seek the death penalty upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant of murder.[4]Â  See State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 559 S.E.2d 847 (2002) (words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction).Â  The statute does not provide any other crimes for which a defendant may be eligible for the death penalty.Â  Cf. State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 (1991) (when a statute is penal in nature, it must be construed strictly against the State and in favor of the defendant).\r\nAlthough Â§ 16-1-40 provides that one who is convicted as an accessory before the fact must be punished in the manner prescribed for the punishment of the principal felon, the Legislature has not indicated any intent in Â§ 16-3-20 to have such an accessory be subject to the most severe punishment of death.Â  See State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004) (if Legislature had intended certain result in a statute it would have said so); State v. Cutler, 274 S.C. 376, 264 S.E.2d 420 (1980) (where there is conflict between general statute and specific statute, the specific prevails). \r\nGiven the plain language of Â§ 16-3-20 and the fact the Legislature has not shown an intent to make one charged with accessory before the fact to murder death penalty-eligible, the trial judge properly found that respondent is not eligible for the death penalty and properly dismissed the Stateâ€™s notice of intent to seek the death penalty.\r\nOur disposition of this issue makes it unnecessary to address petitionerâ€™s factual argument.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  Accordingly, the decision of the lower court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. TOAL,C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would reverse the decision of the trial court finding Respondent ineligible for the death penalty.Â  In my opinion, a charge of accessory before the fact to murder implicates the death penalty under South Carolina law.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nI agree with the majorityâ€™s contention that the plain language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (2003) allowing the State to seek the death penalty only applies upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant of murder, and that the statute does not provide any other crimes for which a defendant may be eligible for the death penalty.Â  However, in my view, a conviction of accessory before the fact to murder is regarded by law as a conviction for murder and therefore Â§ 16-3-20 applies.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-40 (2003) defines an accessory as follows:Â  \r\n    A person who aids in the commission of a felony or is an accessory before the fact in the commission of a felony by counseling, hiring, or otherwise procuring the felony to be committed is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be punished in the manner prescribed for the punishment of the principal felon.Â  (Emphasis supplied).\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn this case, Respondent was indicted on two counts of accessory before the fact to the underlying felony of murder.Â  To illustrate my interpretation of Â§ 16-1-40 and its applicability to the issue here, if we were to replace each instance of the general term felony in Â§ 16-1-40 with the specific felony of murder relevant in this case, the result is that a â€œperson who . . . is an accessory before the fact in the commission of a murder by counseling, hiring, or otherwise procuring the murder to be committed is guilty of a murder . . . .â€Â  Therefore, if a jury convicted Respondent for accessory before the fact to murder, the plain language of Â§ 16-1-40, in my view, would regard Respondent as guilty of the crime of murder.Â  Accordingly, Respondent would be eligible for the death penalty under Â§ 16-3-20.[5]\r\nFurthermore, practical concerns dictate that an accessory before the fact to murder be eligible for the death penalty under South Carolinaâ€™s statutory scheme.Â  A person who counsels, hires, or otherwise procures a felony to be committed may be indicted and convicted as either an accessory before the fact or for the substantive felony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-50 (2003).Â  Under the majorityâ€™s conclusion then, whether a defendant who counseled, hired, or otherwise procured a murder is eligible for the death penalty ultimately comes down to whether the State decides to prosecute the defendant as an accessory before the fact to murder or for the murder itself.Â  The General Assembly certainly did not intend such an illogical result.Â  \r\nUltimately, the majorityâ€™s conclusion rests on hesitancy to apply the clear language of the accessory statute.Â  However, Â§ 16-1-40 clearly states that an accessory is guilty of the principal felony and is punished accordingly.Â  I see no reason to depart from this reading of the plain language.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would hold that a defendant who is an accessory before the fact to murder is guilty of murder by operation of lawÂ Â  and is subject to the death penalty in accordance with Â§ 16-3-20.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding that Respondent was ineligible for the death penalty and reinstate the Stateâ€™s notice of intent to seek the death penalty.Â \r\n\r\n[1]Respondentâ€™s son, Steven Bixby, was convicted of murder and was subsequently sentenced to death on February 21, 2007. \r\n[2]The elements that must concur to justify the conviction of one as an accessory before the fact are:Â  (1) that the defendant advised and agreed, or urged the parties or in some way aided them, to commit the offense; (2) that the defendant was not present when the offense was committed; and (3) that the principal committed the crime.Â  State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 447 S.E.2d 175 (1993). \r\n[3]See, e.g., State v. Lewis, 293 S.C. 107, 359 S.E.2d 66 (1987). \r\n[4]The dissent states that resting the defendantâ€™s eligibility for the death penalty on the Stateâ€™s decision whether to prosecute a defendant as an accessory before the fact to murder or for the murder itself is an illogical result.Â  However, giving the prosecutor discretion in determining what charges to bring against a defendant and whether a defendant should be eligible for the death penalty is exactly what our law provides.Â  A prosecutor should not be hampered in making these determinations.Â  Cf. Ex parte Littlefield, 343 S.C. 212, 540 S.E.2d 81 (2000) (South Carolina Constitution and case law place the unfettered discretion to prosecute solely in the prosecutorâ€™s hands).\r\n[5] Interestingly, in 1977 when the General Assembly created a bifurcated trial structure consisting of a guilt phase and a sentencing phase for cases in which the death penalty is sought, Â§ 16-1-40 read as follows:\r\n\r\n  Whoever aids in the commission of a felony or is accessory thereto before the fact by counseling, hiring or otherwise procuring the felony to be committed shall be punished in the manner prescribed for the punishment of the principal felon.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, the General Assembly amended Â§ 16-1-40 to read in its present form.Â  See 1993 S.C. Acts 3229, 3237-38.Â  Although the 1993 amendment consisted mainly of grammatical changes, it is interesting to note the addition of the phrase that an accessory â€œis guilty of a felonyâ€ just before the language declaring the manner of â€œpunishmentâ€ for an accessory.Â  In my view, this alteration makes the statute easily applicable to the bifurcated trial structure created by the General Assembly fifteen years earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26309","title":"McClain v.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Robert E. Bogan, of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tPerry Hudson Gravely, of Pickens, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a definite suspension or any lesser sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE.Â  Respondent requests that, if a definite suspension is imposed, it run from the date of his interim suspension.[1]Â  We accept the Agreement and find a two year suspension from the practice of law is the appropriate sanction; however, we deny respondentâ€™s request that the definite suspension run from the date of his interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nA.Â  Criminal Matter\r\nRespondent was arrested and charged with possession of alprazolam, a generic form of Xanax; possession of hydrocodone biterate, a generic form of Lortab; and possession of morphine sulfate, all in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(d)(2).Â  He was also charged with possession of marijuana, less than 28 grams, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(d)(3), and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, based on his possession of 3.84 grams of cocaine, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(b)(1).Â  The charges for possession of alprazolam and possession of morphine sulfate were dismissed.Â  With regard to the remaining charges, respondent pled guilty to possession of hydrocodone and acetaminophen, possession of marijuana and possession of cocaine.Â  Respondent does not dispute that he committed the offenses and admits that, at the time of his arrest, he suffered from a cocaine dependency for which he has since sought and completed inpatient and outpatient treatment.\r\nB.Â  Legal Representation Matter\r\nRespondent was retained by three clients and was paid a fee of either $3,000 or $3,500 by or on behalf of each client.Â  The clients maintain that, upon his suspension, respondent failed to adequately communicate with them regarding their cases and they were required to retain other counsel to complete their litigation.\r\nRespondent acknowledges he did not communicate with the clients with reasonable diligence and promptness as required by Rules 1.3 and 1.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and that his physical and mental condition, caused by his drug dependency, may have impaired his ability to handle the clientsâ€™ cases, in violation of Rule 1.16(a)(2), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Respondent also acknowledges the clients are entitled to a refund of their retainer fees, less any amount respondent earned by performing work on the clientsâ€™ behalf.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation, keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.16(d) (upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fees or expenses that has not been earned or incurred); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); and Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act involving moral turpitude).\r\nRespondent also admits that he has violated the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or to engage in conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find a two year suspension is the appropriate sanction for respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for two years.Â  Respondent shall not be eligible for reinstatement until respondent has paid his fine and completed the sentence imposed, including release from the period of probation.Â  See Rule 33(f)(10), RLDE.Â  Finally, respondent shall, within thirty days of the date of this opinion, enter into a restitution plan with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and begin making restitution to presently known and/or subsequently identified clients, banks, and other persons and entities, including the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection, who have incurred losses as a result of respondentâ€™s misconduct in connection with these matters.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In re Cureton, 363 S.C. 78, 609 S.E.2d 527 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26310","title":"State v.

Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  Appellant Bryan Ladner was indicted for criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree.Â  A jury found appellant guilty, and the trial court sentenced him to 14 yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  Appellant directly appeals from his conviction.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was charged with digitally penetrating the victimâ€™s vagina on October 31, 2003.Â  The victim, at the time, was approximately two and a half years old.\r\nAfter the jury had been selected, but prior to any testimony being taken, the State informed the trial court it was not planning to call the victim as a witness.[1]Â  Instead, the State intended to introduce the victimâ€™s statement implicating appellant through the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.Â  In response, defense counsel stated that the victim might be called in the defenseâ€™s case-in-chief, and therefore, appellant requested a competency hearing.Â  Appellant also made a motion in limine to determine the admissibility of the hearsay statement. \r\nThe hearing on the motion in limine proceeded, and the State put up Marla Jackson.[2]Â  Marla testified that on Halloween 2003 at around 7 p.m., appellant and others arrived at her house to take the victim trick-or-treating.Â  About one hour later, appellant returned the victim to Marlaâ€™s house.Â  Within approximately 45 minutes of the victim returning to Marlaâ€™s house, the victim went to the bathroom and complained that her crotch area[3] hurt when she urinated.Â  It was discovered that the victim was bleeding, so Marla laid her down in the bedroom and saw that she was red and swollen in her vaginal area.Â  Marla asked the victim what happened, and the victim said, â€œBryan did it.â€Â  The victim then stated, â€œNo, Bryan didnâ€™t do nothing.â€\r\nThe trial court ruled that the victimâ€™s statement to Marla identifying appellant as the perpetrator was admissible because it met all the elements of the excited utterance hearsay exception.Â  Further, the trial court stated that the victimâ€™s incompetency based on her youth would not bar admission under the excited utterance rule.Â  Defense counsel then requested the competency hearing.Â  The victim was questioned by defense counsel and so clearly demonstrated she was incompetent to testify that at the close of questioning, defense counsel conceded she was not competent as a witness.Â  Appellant requested that the trial court reconsider its hearsay ruling, but the trial court again ruled the statement admissible.\r\nThe following additional facts were developed during trial testimony.Â  Appellant lived with his fiancÃ©e Joanna Sweatman.Â  Joanna had been the victimâ€™s primary caretaker until September 2003, when the victim was sent to Tennessee to be taken care of by Joannaâ€™s mother, Eloise Cales.[4]Â  Eloise traveled with the victim back to South Carolina on October 30, 2003.Â  Arrangements were made on that day for Joanna and appellant to take the victim trick-or-treating the next evening.\r\nMarla was the Stateâ€™s primary witness.Â  She testified that she was an â€œaunt figureâ€ to the victim.Â  Marla drove Eloise and the victim from Tennessee to South Carolina the day before Halloween 2003; both Eloise and the victim stayed at Marlaâ€™s house on October 30 and 31.Â  Marla described how she got the victim ready for trick-or-treating around 6 p.m. on October 31:\r\n\r\n  [B]efore I put her panty hose on, I took her pull-up[5] off and washed her down because she had peed in her pull-up that we originally put on her after she had taken a bath earlier and I had to wash her, wipe her down and then put a new pull-up on her before I put her tights on her. \r\n\r\nThe victim was outfitted as a princess for Halloween:Â  she had on a dress, make-up, and tights as her costume.Â  \r\nAround 7 p.m., Joanna picked the victim up from Marlaâ€™s house; appellant was driving, and several others were in the car.Â  Appellant drove the group to a neighboring subdivision to go trick-or-treating.Â  Between 7:45 and 8 p.m., appellant returned the victim to Marlaâ€™s house.Â  Marla testified that she was on the porch giving out candy when the victim returned, and she noticed the victim had been crying because her face was red and her make-up was smeared.Â  Â Â  \r\nAppellant explained that he brought the victim back because she was having a temper tantrum.Â  According to Marla, appellant did not even stay two minutes at her house.Â  Eloise came to the door and took the victim inside.Â  Shortly thereafter, Marla also went inside the house.Â  The victim sang a couple of songs, karaoke-style.Â  After her singing, while sitting on the couch, the victim grabbed at her crotch and said she had â€œto pee.â€Â  Eloise took her in the bathroom, and Marla went in to â€œfind out what was going on.â€Â  Eloise wiped the child and noticed blood on the toilet paper.[6]Â  She told Marla to take a look at the victim.Â  Marla testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  And me and my mom and Eloise was [sic] in the room and [the victim] was all red in her crotch area and swollen and she had scratches all behind her legs.Â  She had a hand print - a large hand print on her arm, a larger hand print on her leg.Â  She had scratches around her wrist.Â  And I asked her what happened, because she said her tooch hurt, and I asked her what happened and she said, Bryan did it.Â  And then she goes, No, Bryan didnâ€™t do nothing, Bryan didnâ€™t do nothing.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nThe victim was taken to an emergency room and treated by Dr. Charles Staples.Â  Qualified as an expert in sexual assault examinations, Dr. Staples testified the victim had bruises on her left cheek, arm, and inside thigh; his vaginal exam revealed redness.Â  In Dr. Staplesâ€™ opinion, the victimâ€™s injuries were consistent with sexual abuse that was acute, i.e., it had occurred in the previous 12 to 24 hours.\r\nThe victim was transported to, and examined at, Carolina Medical Assessment Center for a full sexual assault examination.Â  Dr. Elizabeth Gibbs, who was qualified as an expert in child sexual examinations, testified that her examination occurred around 1 a.m. on November 1, 2003.Â  She reported that the victimâ€™s left leg had been constricted from her left leg being held up.Â  Regarding the victimâ€™s vaginal injuries, Dr. Gibbs testified that the area was extremely swollen, there was a laceration on the left side, and bleeding was coming from the hymen.Â  She also stated the victim was in a great deal of pain from the vaginal injuries.Â  Dr. Gibbs opined the victim had suffered a blunt force penetrating injury to her vagina that had occurred within 24 hours of the time of examination.Â  Moreover, Dr. Gibbs stated that although cases of digital penetration generally present with much less trauma than this victim had, her injuries nonetheless could have been caused by digital penetration.\r\nBased on the victimâ€™s identification of appellant, the police interrogated appellant in the early morning hours of November 1, 2003.Â  He gave two statements to Detective Aldo Bassi.Â  In his second statement, appellant wrote the following:\r\n\r\n  [the victim] was tired and crying so [Joanna] asked me to take her home.Â  She put [the victim and another child] in the car.Â  [The victim] was crying [hysterically] and from the front seat I grabbed her arm to get her to stop, she didnâ€™t so I grabbed her leg still trying to get her attention for her to stop.Â  She kept crying and I pushed on her diaper in groin area. Â She still wouldnâ€™t stop so I pushed on her crotch w/my finger.Â  She [stopped] crying and was fine the rest of the way home.Â  (It was my right hand and my finger slightly penitrated [sic] her) I did this out of frustration [and] anger to make her stop crying [hysterically].\r\n\r\nAt trial, however, appellant testified that the victim was â€œthrowing a fitâ€ as he was driving her back from trick-or-treating so he reached back and â€œpopped her on the leg.â€Â  Appellant stated that Detective Bassi put words in his mouth about what had happened to the victim.Â  Appellant testified that he wrote the second statement because he â€œjust wanted to go home.â€Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the victimâ€™s hearsay statement testimonial and therefore inadmissible under Crawford v. Washington?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err by admitting the victimâ€™s hearsay statement under the excited utterance exception?\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err by denying appellantâ€™s request for a directed verdict?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Testimonial vs. Nontestimonial under Crawford v. Washington\r\nAppellant argues it was error to admit the victimâ€™s hearsay statement because pursuant to Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), the hearsay statement was testimonial and therefore inadmissible because he had no prior opportunity to cross-examine the victim.Â  We disagree.[7]\r\nThe Sixth Amendmentâ€™s Confrontation Clause guarantees that â€œ[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right â€¦ to be confronted with the witnesses against him.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  In Crawford v. Washington, the United States Supreme Court (USSC) held that the admission of testimonial hearsay statements against an accused violates the Confrontation Clause if: Â (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial, and (2) the accused has had no prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.Â  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. at 54.Â  With regard to testimonial statements, Crawford overruled Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980), which held that a hearsay statement is admissible if it bears adequate â€œindicia of reliability,â€ i.e., it falls under a firmly rooted hearsay exception or there is an adequate showing of â€œparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.â€ Â See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. at 60; Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66.Â  \r\nThe Crawford Court declined to comprehensively define â€œtestimonial.â€Â  It did, however, state that the â€œcore class of â€˜testimonialâ€™ statementsâ€ includes:\r\n\r\n  ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent, such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially; \r\n  \r\n  extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions;\r\n  \r\n  statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial; and\r\n  \r\n  statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations.\r\n\r\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. at 51-52 (citations omitted).Â  In addition, the USSC stated that testimony â€œis typically â€˜[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.â€™â€Â  Id. at 51 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)).Â  The Crawford Court further observed that â€œ[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.â€Â  Id. at 51.\r\nJust last year, the USSC provided further guidance on the Crawford decision in Davis v. Washington, ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (2006).Â  There, the USSC dealt with two different domestic violence cases and held (1) a victimâ€™s identification of her abuser in response to initial questions from a 911 emergency operator was not testimonial, but (2) where police responded to a domestic disturbance, found the wife and husband at home, and took a statement from the wife about the husbandâ€™s abuse (while the husband was in another room), the wifeâ€™s statements were testimonial.Â  The Davis Court explained: \r\n\r\n  Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. Â They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nDavis v. Washington, 126 S.Ct. at 2273-74.Â  The Davis Court specifically noted that its holdings related to police interrogations.Â  Id. at 2274 n.1. \r\nFurthermore, while Crawford apparently left Roberts viable as the primary authority for analyzing nontestimonial hearsay, Davis arguably â€œdeclared that the Sixth Amendment simply has no application outside the scope of testimonial hearsay.â€Â  Tom Lininger, Reconceptualizing Confrontation After Davis,&nbsp;85 Tex. L. Rev. 271, 285 (2006); see also U.S. v. Tolliver, 454 F.3d 660, 665 n.2&nbsp;(7th Cir. 2006) (Davis â€œappears to have resolved the issue, holding that nontestimonial hearsay is not subject to the Confrontation Clauseâ€), cert. denied 127 S.Ct. 1019 (2007).\r\nThe hearsay statement at issue in the instant case was made by a two-and-a-half year old girl to her caretakers immediately after they discovered blood coming from her vaginal area.Â  The victim indicated that her â€œtoochâ€ hurt, and Marla asked what happened.Â  The victim responded by saying appellant â€œdid it,â€ and then quickly stating he â€œdidnâ€™t do nothing.â€ [8]Â  \r\nWe find the victimâ€™s statement to Marla is clearly nontestimonial.Â  Significantly, the victimâ€™s statement is much more akin to a remark to an acquaintance rather than a formal statement to government officers.Â  See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. at 51.Â  Given the circumstances surrounding the victimâ€™s statement identifying appellant as the person who hurt her, as well as to whom the statement was made, the statement does not amount to â€œa solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.â€Â  Id.Â  Significantly, Marlaâ€™s questions, as well as the victimâ€™s responses, were not designed to implicate the criminal assailant, but to ascertain the nature of the childâ€™s injury.Â  Cf. State v. Davis, 371 S.C. 170, 178, 638 S.E.2d 57, 61&nbsp;(2006) (generally, statements made outside of an official investigatory or judicial context are nontestimonial).\r\nCases in other jurisdictions with similar facts have also held the child-victimâ€™s statements to be nontestimonial. Â See generally Jerome C. Latimer, Confrontation After Crawford:Â  The Decisionâ€™s Impact On How Hearsay Is Analyzed Under The Confrontation Clause, 36 Seton Hall L. Rev. 327, 364-66 (2006) (statements made by children to persons unconnected to law enforcement have consistently been found to be nontestimonial).Â  For example, in Purvis v. State, 829 N.E.2d 572 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S.Ct. 1580 (2006), the court held that the ten-year-old victimâ€™s statements to his mother and her boyfriend immediately after the boy was molested were not testimonial.Â  The victim, after being asked by the motherâ€™s boyfriend â€œwhat happened?â€ stated that the defendant had â€œput his â€˜privateâ€™ into [the victimâ€™s] mouth and made [the victim] â€˜suck on it.â€™â€Â  The boy repeated similar statements to his mother soon afterward.Â  Id. at 576-77.\r\nIn finding no Confrontation Clause violation under Crawford, the Purvis court explained as follows:\r\n\r\n  The rationale of the rule in Crawford is to exclude from evidence statements that have not been cross-examined that were gathered for the purpose of use at a later trial.Â  [The victimâ€™s] statements to [his mother and the man he treated as his father] were not elicited for the purpose of preparing to prosecute anyone but rather to gain information about what happened, find out if [the victim] was harmed, and remedy any harm that had befallen him. Â Â \r\n\r\nId. at 579.Â  The court also noted that simply because â€œparents turn over information about crimes to law enforcement authorities does not transform their interactions with their children into police investigations.â€Â  Id. \r\nIn State v. Aaron L., 865 A.2d 1135&nbsp;(Conn. 2005), the Connecticut Supreme Court found that a statement made by the victim when she was two-and-a-half years old was properly admitted.Â  The child had spontaneously told her mother: Â â€œâ€˜Iâ€™m not going to tell you that I touch daddyâ€™s pee-pee.â€™â€Â  Id. at 1145.Â  Regarding the Crawford issue, the Court stated that â€œthe victimâ€™s communication to her mother clearly does not fall within the core category of ex parte testimonial statements that the court was concerned with in Crawford.â€Â  Id. at 1146&nbsp;n.21.\r\nIn Herrera-Vega v. State,&nbsp;888 So.2d 66 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004), a three-year-old girl â€œspontaneously told her mother, as she was putting on the childâ€™s underpants, that twenty-year-old Vega had placed his tongue in her â€˜private parts.â€™ Â [The victim] reluctantly repeated the story to her father minutes later.â€Â  Id. at 67.Â  The court there held the trial court did not violate Crawford by allowing the parents to testify to their daughterâ€™s statements.Â  Id. at 69.\r\nIn sum, the victimâ€™s hearsay statement in the instant case was not admitted in violation of Crawford because it is a nontestimonial statement.Â  Accordingly, there was no Confrontation Clause violation.\r\n2.Â  Excited Utterance\r\nAppellant also argues the victimâ€™s statement was improperly admitted under the excited utterance hearsay exception.Â  Appellantâ€™s arguments on this issue are twofold.Â  First, appellant contends the statement does not qualify as an excited utterance.Â  Specifically, appellant argues the victim was no longer under the influence of the startling event as evidenced by her singing karaoke songs and eating candy after she returned to Marlaâ€™s home.Â  Second, appellant contends that because the victim was declared incompetent to testify at trial, her hearsay statement made over one year prior to trial is similarly unreliable.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€ Â Rule 801(c), SCRE. Â The general rule is that hearsay is not admissible.Â  Rule 802, SCRE.Â  There are, however, numerous exceptions to this rule, such as the excited utterance exception. Â The rules of evidence define excited utterance as a â€œstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.â€ Â Rule 803(2), SCRE. Â \r\nAn excited utterance may be admitted whether or not the declarant is available as a witness.Â  See Rule 803, SCRE (entitled â€œHearsay Exceptions; Availability of Declarant Immaterialâ€).Â  Moreover, when a statement is admissible because it falls within a Rule 803 exception, it may be used substantively, that is, to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 283-84, 523 S.E.2d 173, 177&nbsp;(1999).Â  Consequently, in the instant case, if the victimâ€™s statement qualifies as an excited utterance, the State properly admitted it to prove that appellant committed the assault.\r\nLooking at the rule, there are three elements that must be met to find a statement to be an excited utterance:Â  (1) the statement must relate to a startling event or condition; (2) the statement must have been made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement; and (3) the stress of excitement must be caused by the startling event or condition.Â  State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 21, 558 S.E.2d 518, 521&nbsp;(2002).Â  The excited utterance exception is based on the rationale that â€œthe startling event suspends the declarantâ€™s process of reflective thought, reducing the likelihood of fabrication.â€ Â State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. at 284, 523 S.E.2d at 177.Â  A court must consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether a statement falls within the excited utterance exception, and that determination is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Sims, supra.\r\nIn our opinion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the victimâ€™s statement as an excited utterance.Â  Clearly, the statement related to the startling event of the victim being severely injured in her vaginal area.Â  The victim was complaining of pain and was bleeding when the statements were made, and thus, the victim made the declaration while under the stress of her attack.Â  Finally, this stress obviously was caused by the startling event of the sexual assault itself.Â  The requirements of Rule 803(2), SCRE, were easily satisfied in this case.Â  See also Purvis v. State, 829 N.E.2d at 581 (where the court found the victimâ€™s statement to his father figure, made almost immediately after being molested, and while the boy was â€œplainly upset,â€ clearly â€œmet all the criteriaâ€ for excited utterances).\r\nWe turn now to appellantâ€™s claim that because the victim was declared incompetent to testify, her excited utterance was inherently unreliable and therefore was erroneously admitted.Â  This is a novel issue in South Carolina.[9]\r\nThe majority of courts that have encountered this issue have held that even though a child could be declared incompetent to testify at trial, the childâ€™s â€œspontaneous declarations or res gestae statementsâ€ are nonetheless admissible.Â  See Jay M. Zitter, Annotation, Admissibility of Testimony Regarding Spontaneous Declarations Made by One Incompetent to Testify at Trial, 15 A.L.R. 4th 1043 (1982); see also 2 McCormick on Evidence Â§ 272 (6th ed. 2006) (â€œan excited utterance is admissible despite the fact that the declarant was a child and would have been incompetent as a witness for that reasonâ€); 2 Whartonâ€™s Criminal Evidence Â§ 7:1 (15th ed. 1998) (noting that courts have admitted out-of-court statements by children found incompetent to testify).Â  \r\nIn Morgan v. Foretich, 846 F.2d 941&nbsp;(4th Cir. 1988), the Fourth Circuit dealt with this issue in a civil case for damages arising out of child sexual abuse.Â  Before proceeding to the legal analysis of the evidentiary issues, the Morgan court noted generally the following:\r\n\r\n  An estimated one in five females suffers from sexual abuse as a childâ€¦. Â [I]n two-thirds of child abuse cases, the incident is never even reportedâ€¦. Â Even when the incident is reported, prosecution is difficult and convictions are few.Â  Much of this difficulty stems from the fact that methods of proof in child abuse cases are severely lacking. Â Often, the child is the only witness. Â Yet age may make the child incompetent to testify in court, and fear, especially when the perpetrator is a family member, may make the child unwilling or unable to testify.\r\n\r\nId. at 943 (footnotes and citations omitted).[10]Â  After thoroughly analyzing the hearsay issue, the court decided that four of the victimâ€™s statements made to her mother when the victim was two and three years old should have been admitted as excited utterances; significantly, the court also found that the victimâ€™s â€œyouthful incompetencyâ€ would not prevent the admission of the hearsay statements.Â  Id. at 946-48.\r\nThe Washington Court of Appeals faced this exact issue in a case with facts strikingly similar to the case at bar. Â See State v. Bouchard, 639 P.2d 761 (Wash. Ct. App. 1982).Â  In Bouchard, the defendantâ€™s conviction for indecent liberties with his three-year-old granddaughter was affirmed; the victim had suffered a perforated hymen which the State asserted was the result of the grandfatherâ€™s digital penetration of the victim.Â  Id. at 762.Â  The hearsay evidence was described by the court as follows:\r\n\r\n  The little girlâ€™s mother testified that when her daughter returned home she complained of â€œwaterâ€ in her pants. Â When the mother changed the childâ€™s clothing, she found blood around her daughterâ€™s lower abdominal and vaginal areas. Â When questioned about the blood, the child told her mother, â€œGrandpa did it.â€ Â The father and attending physicians testified that the child made similar statements to them.\r\n\r\nId. at 763. Â Â The Bouchard court rejected the defendantâ€™s arguments that the statements were inadmissible hearsay and the victimâ€™s incompetency should have prevented the admission of the statements.Â  The court held the victimâ€™s statements fell within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule and specifically stated â€œ[t]he fact that the declarant herself (an infant) would not be competent to testify does not prohibit the use of the excited utterances.â€ Â Id. \r\nWe hold that the incompetency of a declarant at the time of trial does not preclude the admission of that declarantâ€™s excited utterance through a different, competent witness.Â  See, e.g., State v. Bauer, 704 P.2d 264, 267&nbsp;(Ariz. Ct. App. 1985) (â€œexcited utterances of children who are incompetent to testify because of their age are admissible in evidenceâ€); Kilgore v. State, 340 S.E.2d 640, 643&nbsp;(Ga. Ct. App. 1986) (rejecting the contention â€œthat because the victim would have been incompetent to testify in court, her out-of-court statements were thus unreliable and incompetentâ€); People v. Smith, 604 N.E.2d 858, 871&nbsp;(Ill. 1992) (excited utterances are sufficiently reliable to be admitted even where the declarant is incompetent); Com. v. Pronkoskie, 383 A.2d 858, 861&nbsp;n.5 (Pa. 1978) (â€œa finding of incompetency to testify does not necessarily undermine the indicia of reliability attendant upon an excited utterance of the incompetent witnessâ€); Bouchard, supra.\r\nThe legal rationales underlying the rules about both competency and the excited utterance hearsay exception make plain that one ruling has little to do with the other.Â  The competency of a witness depends solely on the facts as they exist when the testimony is given. Â 81 Am. Jur. 2d Witnesses Â§ 160 (2004).[11]Â  Conversely, the intrinsic reliability of an excited utterance derives from the statementâ€™s spontaneity which is determined by the totality of the circumstances surrounding the statement when it was uttered.Â  Sims, supra. Â This reliability â€œwill normally remain undiluted by faulty memory, inability to understand questions or otherwise to communicate on the witness stand.â€ Â Pronkoskie, 383 A.2d at 861&nbsp;n.5.Â  In other words, the trustworthiness of the excited utterance â€œstems not from [the declarantâ€™s] competency, but rather from the unique circumstances in which [the] statements were made.â€ Â People v. Smith, 604 N.E.2d at 871.&nbsp; Thus, the fact that a declarant is not able to testify at trial does not diminish the reliability of that declarantâ€™s excited utterance.Â  Because the reliability of the excited utterance is unaffected by the incompetency determination, but rather is independently evaluated under long-standing rules developed from the common law, we find appellantâ€™s argument that the victimâ€™s incompetency at the time of trial should disqualify the admission of her excited utterance untenable.\r\nAccordingly, in the instant case, it was well within the trial court discretion to admit the victimâ€™s statements under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.\r\n3.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nFinally, appellant argues the trial court erred by denying his directed verdict motion because the evidence only raised a suspicion that he was guilty.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn a directed verdict motion in a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight. E.g., State v. Burdette,&nbsp;335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531&nbsp;(1999). Â If the State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt, or from which the defendantâ€™s guilt could fairly and logically be deduced, the case must go to the jury. Â Id. Â A defendant is only entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to put up evidence of the offense charged. Â State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36&nbsp;(2001).Â  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict motion, this Court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the State. Â Burdette,&nbsp;supra.\r\nWe find the trial court correctly denied the directed verdict motion in this case. Â Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, including the testimony which places appellant with the victim at the most likely time the injury was inflicted, the victimâ€™s identification of appellant as the perpetrator, as well as appellantâ€™s inculpatory statements, it is clear that the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  To the extent appellant is arguing that the Stateâ€™s case was based on unreliable evidence, the trial court is only concerned with the existence of the evidence, not its weight, when deciding a directed verdict motion. Â McHoney, supra; Burdette,&nbsp;supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor all the above reasons, appellantâ€™s conviction is AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] At the time of trial, the victim was approximately three and a half years old.Â  The State indicated to the trial court that although it originally had planned on calling the victim as a witness, the Stateâ€™s position was that the child could not testify because of her tender years.\r\n[2] The victim was staying at Marlaâ€™s house when the relevant events occurred.Â  The relationships between the victim and her various caretakers will be further explained infra.\r\n[3] The child referred to her crotch area as her â€œtooch.â€\r\n[4] Both Joanna and Eloise were defense witnesses.Â  Eloise testified that the victimâ€™s mother was â€œunableâ€ to take care of the victim and asked Joanna to take care of her.Â  Joanna testified that her brother was dating the victimâ€™s mother â€œand he didnâ€™t want a baby in the house so they brought her to me and gave her to me and asked me to keep her.â€Â  Joanna explained that she was paid to take care of the victim and she did so for approximately one year. \r\n[5] A pull-up is similar to a diaper and is used by toddlers who are not fully potty-trained.\r\n[6] Blood was also observed on the victimâ€™s pull-up.Â  \r\n[7] Regarding issue preservation, we agree with appellant that although there was no contemporaneous objection during Marlaâ€™s trial testimony, the hearsay issues are not procedurally barred because proper objections were made at the pretrial proceedings held just before Marlaâ€™s testimony. Â See State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 642-43, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840&nbsp;(2001) (where no evidence is taken between the trial courtâ€™s in limine ruling and the admission at trial of the evidence, the issue is preserved).\r\n[8] Other hearsay statements by the victim identifying appellant were also admitted during the Stateâ€™s case.Â  When asked if the victim told him what had happened, Dr. Staples testified, without objection, as follows:Â  â€œShe indicated to me that she had been touched by her auntâ€™s boyfriend that was previously identified at triage as someone named Bryan.Â  And I asked her if the auntâ€™s boyfriend was Bryan and she told me yes.â€Â  Because the trial courtâ€™s ruling dealt only with Marlaâ€™s testimony, however, we restrict our analysis to this particular statement by the victim.Â  Nonetheless, we note that since there was no objection to this part of Dr. Staplesâ€™ testimony, any arguable error regarding Marlaâ€™s testimony would be deemed harmless.Â  See State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985) (erroneous admission of hearsay evidence is subject to harmless error analysis; error is only harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial); State v. McFarlane, 279 S.C. 327, 330, 306 S.E.2d 611, 613&nbsp;(1983) (â€œIt is well settled that the admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative to other evidence.â€).\r\n[9] In Sims, there was a somewhat similar factual scenario; however, this precise legal issue was not raised.Â  There, a five-year-old boy witnessed a brutal attack on his mother, who later died.Â  At trial, the boy was declared competent to testify, but while on the stand, he stopped answering questions and would not tell the jury the identity of the person who was in the apartment on the night his mother was attacked.Â  The responding police officer was recalled to the stand and testified that the boy had identified the defendant. The trial court subsequently ruled the statement was admissible hearsay. Â Sims, 348 S.C. at 20, 558 S.E.2d at 520.Â  This Court affirmed, finding the boyâ€™s statement was an excited utterance.\r\n[10] See generally Robert G. Marks, Note, Should We Believe The People Who Believe The Children?: Â The Need For A New Sexual Abuse Tender Years Hearsay Exception Statute,&nbsp;32 Harv. J. on Legis. 207, 207, 214 (1995) (where the author observes that the â€œsexual abuse of children is one of Americaâ€™s most terrifying social problemsâ€ and child sexual abuse â€œis an extremely difficult crime to prosecuteâ€).\r\n[11] Under South Carolina law, a person will be found incompetent as a witness â€œif the court determines that (1) the proposed witness is incapable of expressing himself concerning the matter as to be understood by the judge and jury either directly or through interpretation by one who can understand him, or (2) the proposed witness is incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth.â€Â  Rule 601(b), SCRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26311","title":"In the Matter of Richard M.

Burney, both of Turner and Burney, P.C., of Laurens, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Respondent Richard Aiken (â€œAikenâ€) filed a law suit against Appellants World Finance Corporation of South Carolina and World Acceptance Corporation (collectively, â€œWorld Financeâ€) alleging various torts arising from the misuse of Aikenâ€™s personal financial information by employees of World Finance.Â  The circuit court denied World Financeâ€™s motion to compel arbitration on the grounds that Aikenâ€™s claims were not within the scope of the arbitration clause.Â  The court of appeals affirmed and this Court granted certiorari.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nWorld Finance is a nationwide consumer finance company with branch offices in South Carolina.Â  Aiken obtained a series of consumer loans from World Finance beginning in 1997 and continuing through late 1999.Â  Aiken paid off his last loan from World Finance in 2000.Â  \r\nIn order to apply for a loan, Aiken was required to supply non-public, personal information to World Finance, including his date of birth and social security number.Â  Upon approval of each loan, Aiken entered into an arbitration agreement with World Finance.Â  Each arbitration agreement provided, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  . . . ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND AND NATURE BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN AGREEMENT, OR ARISING OUT OF ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER OR ARISING OUT OF ANY PRIOR OR FUTURE DEALINGS BETWEEN LENDER AND BORROWER, SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION AND SETTLED BY ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNTIED STATES ARBITRATION ACT, THE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (THE â€œARBITRATION RULES OF THE AAAâ€), AND THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\nBeginning in late 2002, several World Finance employees conspired to use the personal information provided by Aiken and other clients to obtain sham loans and embezzle the proceeds for the employeesâ€™ personal benefit.[1]Â  Upon discovering the misuse of his personal information, Aiken filed suit against World Finance in the court of common pleas for Laurens County seeking damages for outrage and emotional distress, negligence, negligent hiring/supervision, and unfair trade practices.Â  World Finance filed an answer, a motion to dismiss, and a motion to compel arbitration.\r\nThe trial court found that the effectiveness of the arbitration agreement ceased when the relationship of the parties ended.Â  Because Aiken paid off his last loan with World Finance prior to the tortious acts of the employees, the court concluded that Aikenâ€™s tort claims were completely independent of the loan agreements and not subject to the arbitration agreements. Therefore, the court denied World Financeâ€™s motions to compel arbitration.\r\nThe court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court.Â  See Aiken v. World Finance Corp. of South Carolina, 367 S.C. 176, 623 S.E.2d 873 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  This Court granted certiorari and World Finance raises the following issues for review: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in deciding whether Aiken&rsquo;s underlying claims were subject to arbitration without first submitting the issue to an arbitrator?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in finding that Aiken&rsquo;s claims were not significantly related to the underlying loan agreement and therefore not within the scope of arbitration? \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review \r\nThe determination of whether a claim is subject to arbitration is subject to de novo review.Â  Wellman, Inc. v. Square D Co., 366 S.C. 61, 67, 620 S.E.2d 86, 89 (Ct. App. 2005).Â Â  Nevertheless, a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if any evidence reasonably supports the findings.Â  Thornton v. Trident Med. Ctr., L.L.C., 357 S.C. 91, 94, 592 S.E.2d 50, 51 (Ct. App. 2003). Â \r\nLaw/Analysis \r\nI.Â  The appropriate forum for determining the scope of the arbitration clause.\r\nWorld Finance argues that under the terms of the arbitration agreement, arbitration is the proper forum for determining the scope of the arbitration agreement.Â  Therefore, World Finance claims that the court of appeals erred in determining whether the arbitration agreement covered Aikenâ€™s claims without first submitting the issue to an arbitrator.Â  We find that this issue is not properly preserved for review.Â  \r\nIn order to be preserved for appellate review, an issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510 (2006).Â  World Finance made no argument regarding the proper forum for determining the arbitrability of the underlying claims in either its motion to compel arbitration or in the hearing before the circuit court.Â  Instead, World Financeâ€™s argument focused solely on the merits of the motion (i.e., whether Aikenâ€™s claims were within the scope of the arbitration agreement).Â  Consequently, the trial courtâ€™s order only addresses whether the scope of the arbitration agreement encompasses the underlying claims.Â  \r\nWe agree with the court of appeals that the issue of the proper forum for determining the scope of the arbitration agreement is not properly preserved for review.Â  Accordingly, the court of appeals did not err in deciding the question of whether Aikenâ€™s underlying claims were within the scope of the arbitration agreement.\r\nII.Â  Significant relationship between the underlying claims and the contract containing the arbitration agreement.\r\nWorld Finance argues that the court of appeals erred in finding that Aikenâ€™s claims were not within the scope of the partiesâ€™ arbitration agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nBoth state and federal policy favor arbitration of disputes and unless a court can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to any interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should generally be ordered.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596-97, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118-19 (2001).Â  However, arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.Â  Id. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  Given these principles, courts generally hold that broadly-worded arbitration agreements[2] apply to disputes in which a â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ exists between the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained. Id. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119 (quoting Long v. Silver, 248 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2001)).Â  \r\nWorld Finance primarily argues that because Aikenâ€™s contracts with World Finance gave the conspirators access to Aikenâ€™s information in order to carry out their crimes, there is a significant relationship between Aikenâ€™s claims and the underlying loan agreement, thereby warranting arbitration.Â  We find this argument unpersuasive.Â  In our opinion, the â€œrelationshipâ€ asserted by World Finance between Aikenâ€™s tort claims and the partiesâ€™ prior dealings under the loan agreements hardly rises to the level of â€œsignificant.â€Â  Applying what amounts to a â€œbut-forâ€ causation standard essentially includes every dispute imaginable between the parties, which greatly oversimplifies the partiesâ€™ agreement to arbitrate claims between them.Â  Such a result is illogical and unconscionable. See Seifert v. U.S. Home Corp., 750 So. 2d 633, 638 (Fla. 1999) (â€œ[T]he mere fact that the dispute would not have arisen but for the existence of the contract and consequent relationship between the parties is insufficient by itself to transform a dispute into one â€˜arising out of or relating toâ€™ the agreement.â€).Â  See also The Vestry and Church Wardens of the Church of the Holy Cross v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc., 356 S.C. 202, 209, 588 S.E.2d 136, 140 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œ[T]he mere fact that an arbitration clause might apply to matters beyond the express scope of the underlying contract does not alone imply that the clause should apply to every dispute between the parties.â€).Â  \r\nThe court of appeals also rejected this overly simplified approach.Â  Relying heavily on the fact that Aiken had paid his loans in full when the employeesâ€™ tortious acts occurred, the court of appeals found that there was no significant relationship between Aikenâ€™s tort claims and his loan agreements with World Finance.Â  See Aiken, 367 S.C. at 182-83, 623 S.E.2d at 876.Â  Therefore, the court held that Aikenâ€™s claims were not within the scope of the arbitration agreement found in the underlying contract.[3]Â  \r\nAlthough we agree with the ultimate conclusion reached by the court of appeals, we do not consider the timing of the employeesâ€™ tortious conduct to be relevant to the arbitrability of Aikenâ€™s claim.Â  Instead, we pronounce a more definitive rule for determining whether a significant relationship exists between a dispute between parties to a contract and the underlying contract, thereby implicating an arbitration agreement in the contract.Â  Because even the most broadly-worded arbitration agreements still have limits founded in general principles of contract law, this Court will refuse to interpret any arbitration agreement as applying to outrageous torts that are unforeseeable to a reasonable consumer in the context of normal business dealings.[4]Â  \r\nIn this case, we find the theft of Aikenâ€™s personal information by World Finance employees to be outrageous conduct that Aiken could not possibly have foreseen when he agreed to do business with World Finance.Â  Consequently, in signing the agreement to arbitrate, Aiken could not possibly have been agreeing to provide an alternative forum for settling claims arising from this wholly unexpected tortious conduct.[5]Â  Accordingly, we hold that Aikenâ€™s claims for unanticipated and unforeseeable tortious conduct by World Financeâ€™s employees are not within the scope of the arbitration agreement with World Finance.[6]Â  \r\nIn establishing the line for claims subject to arbitration, this Court does not seek to exclude all intentional torts from the scope of arbitration.Â  For instance, the parties in the instant case stipulate that a tort claim which essentially alleges a breach of the underlying contract (e.g., breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriation of trade secrets) would be within the contemplation of the parties in agreeing to arbitrate.Â  We only seek to distinguish those outrageous torts, which although factually related to the performance of the contract, are legally distinct from the contractual relationship between the parties.Â  See McMahon v. RMS Electronics, Inc., 618 F. Supp. 189, 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1985).Â  \r\nOur decision today does not ignore the state and federal policies favoring arbitration as a less formal and more efficient means for resolving disputes.Â  See Lackey v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 330 S.C. 388, 396, 498 S.E.2d 898, 902 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  This Court merely seeks, as a matter of public policy, to promote the procurement of arbitration in a commercially reasonable manner.Â  To interpret an arbitration agreement to apply to actions completely outside the expectations of the parties would be inconsistent with this goal.Â \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm as modified the decision of the court of appeals denying World Financeâ€™s motion to compel arbitration.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J. concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that the first issue is not preserved, and I concur in the decision holding that Aikenâ€™s tort claims are without the partiesâ€™ arbitration agreement.Â  I write separately, however, as I do not agree with the majorityâ€™s decision to the extent it finds that identity theft is not foreseeable.Â  See Huggins v. Citibank, N.A., 355 S.C. 329, 585 S.E.2d 275 (2003) (â€œ[The Court] is greatly concerned with the rampant growth of identity theft and financial fraud . . . .â€).Â  I would hold that parties executing a lender-borrower contract containing an arbitration provision do not intend identity theft to be within the ambit of the contract, and further that there is no â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ between the loan agreement and the allegations of Aikenâ€™s tort claims.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 553 S.E.2d 110 (2001).\r\nWith this reservation, I concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The now-former employees pleaded guilty for these offenses and were sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.\r\n[2] Courts typically characterize arbitration agreements purporting to govern disputes â€œarising out of or related toâ€ the underlying contract between the parties as â€œbroadâ€ arbitration clauses encompassing a wide range of issues.Â  See J.J. Ryan &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc Textile, S.A., 863 F.2d 315, 321 (4th Cir. 1988).Â  \r\n[3] While relying mainly on the â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ test to determine whether a claim is arbitrable, the court of appeals also seemed to endorse an additional test used specifically for determining whether a tort claim is arbitrable.Â  The court cited to Zabinski for the proposition that tort claims were within the scope of arbitration when â€œthe particular tort claim is so interwoven with the contract that it could not stand alone.â€Â  Aiken, 367 S.C. at 181, 623 S.E.2d at 875 (citing 346 S.C. at 597 n.4, 553 S.E.2d at 119 n.4).Â  We note that the Zabinski articulation of this test is found in a footnote containing references to tests used by â€œother jurisdictionsâ€ and therefore has not been adopted by this Court as a separate test applicable specifically to tort claims in this context. \r\n[4] Because the parties do not raise the issue of whether any arbitration agreement purporting to apply to such outrageous and unforeseen tortious acts is unconscionable, we leave this determination for another day.\r\n[5] See also Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 41, 524 S.E.2d 839, 846 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œWhen a party invokes an arbitration agreement after the contractual relationship between the parties has ended, the partiesâ€™ intent governs whether the clauseâ€™s authority extends beyond the termination of the contract.â€ (citing Zandford v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc., 112 F.3d 723, 727 (4th Cir. 1997))).Â  \r\n[6] Additionally, we are somewhat puzzled by the concurring opinionâ€™s characterization of identity theft as a foreseeable tort.Â  Although this Court indicated its concern over the â€œrampant growth of identity theftâ€ in Huggins v. Citibank, N.A., 355 S.C. 329, 334, 585 S.E.2d 275, 277 (2003), the rule we set forth today is based on the concept of the expectations of a â€œreasonable man,â€ a standard deeply rooted in tort law.Â  Therefore, a determination of foreseeability under the rule is to be made from the standpoint of the injured party; not this Court.Â  We do not believe that this Court should proclaim that fraudulent acts such as identity theft are foreseeable in the course of normal business dealings.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26314","title":"Simpson v.

GEICO petitioned the family court to permit it to join the action pursuant to Rule 19, SCRCP, or to intervene pursuant to Rule 24, SCRCP.Â  As grounds supporting its motion, GEICO alleged that the family courtâ€™s decision on the partiesâ€™ common law marriage would impact GEICOâ€™s ability to protect its interests under the insurance policy issued to Goethe. \r\nAfter a hearing on the petition, the family court denied GEICOâ€™s motion.Â  The family court found that GEICO was not a necessary party for joinder and did not have standing to intervene.Â  GEICO appeals raising the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in denying GEICOâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tpetition to join Cooperâ€™s family court action regarding the validity \r\n\t\t\tof a common law marriage?&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in denying GEICOâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tpetition to intervene in Cooperâ€™s family court action regarding the \r\n\t\t\tvalidity of a common law marriage?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a motion to join an action pursuant to Rule 19, SCRCP, or intervene in an action pursuant to Rule 24, SCRCP, lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  See Berkeley Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 302 S.C. 186, 189, 394 S.E.2d 712, 714 (1990); and Hunnicutt v. Richenbacker, 268 S.C. 511, 517, 234 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1977).Â  â€œThis Court will not disturb the lower courtâ€™s decision on appeal unless a manifest abuse of discretion is found resulting in an error of law.Â  Moreover, the error of law must be so opposed to the lower courtâ€™s sound discretion as to amount to a deprivation of the legal rights of the party.â€Â  Jeter v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 369 S.C. 433, 633 S.E.2d 143, 146 (2006).Â  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.Â  Joinder\r\nGEICO argues that the family court erred in denying its petition for joinder pursuant to Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tRule 19(a), SCRCP provides in pertinent part:\r\n\tA person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2)\r\n\the claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).Â  â€œThe principle behind this Rule is that whenever possible persons materially interested in the action should be joined so that they may be heard and a complete determination had.â€Â  Rule 19, SCRCP note.Â  \r\nGEICO alleges that Cooper and Goethe commenced the family court action to bolster Cooperâ€™s position against GEICO in the pending litigation involving Cooperâ€™s rights under the Goethe policy.Â  The crux of GEICOâ€™s argument for joinder is that failure to join it as a party in the family court action will perpetuate a fraud on the court and ultimately impair GEICOâ€™s ability to protect its interests under the insurance policy.Â  We find that although GEICO may be affected by the outcome of the family court action, its interest is insufficient to meet the requirements for joinder pursuant to Rule 19(a)(2)(i), SCRCP. \r\nGEICO relies on Rule 19(a)(2)(i), SCRCP to support its motion for joinder.Â  This provision of the rule allows a party to join an action where â€œhe claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest.â€Â  Id.Â  In the instant case, however, GEICO has failed to show that it has an interest relating to the subject of the action.Â  The family court action involves the subject of whether Cooper and Goethe are common law married, and GEICOâ€™s economic interest under the Goethe policy is merely tangential to the family court action.Â  While the existence of a common law marriage may impact GEICOâ€™s liability to Cooper, GEICO has no real interest in the subject matter before the family court. Â \r\nFurthermore, the family court did not err in finding that GEICO was not a necessary party to the family court action.Â  This Court has interpreted Rule 19, SCRCP to require that a party be a â€œnecessary partyâ€ to be joined in an action pursuant to the rule.Â  See Slatton v. Slatton, 289 S.C. 128, 130, 345 S.E.2d 248, 249 (1986).Â  â€œA necessary party is one whose rights must be ascertained and settled before the rights of the parties to the action can be determined.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn this case, the family court had no need to ascertain or settle GEICOâ€™s rights before it determined the rights of Cooper and Goethe in their action to recognize their common law marriage.Â  GEICO argues that the family courtâ€™s reliance on this definition of necessary party as defined in Slatton is misplaced because it is based on a repealed section of the South Carolina Code.Â  See Slatton, 289 S.C. at 130 n.1, 345 S.E.2d at 249 n.1.Â  Although Slatton does not interpret Rule 19, SCRCP, we note (1) that the repealed statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-200 (1976), upon which the definition of â€œnecessary partyâ€ is based was replaced with Rule 19, SCRCP, (2) that this Court recognized the continued application of the definition despite the repeal of the statute, and (3) that the Court decided Slatton after the adoption of Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  Accordingly, the definition of necessary party as used in Slatton remains an accurate articulation of the law of South Carolina.Â  \r\nThe dissent argues that a finding by the family court validating the existence of the common law marriage between Cooper and Geothe will increase GEICOâ€™s burden of proof in its pending declaratory judgment action, thereby impairing GEICOâ€™s ability to protect its economic interest in the payment of insurance benefits.Â  This argument misses the mark.Â  First, GEICOâ€™s interest is merely peripheral to the subject matter of the family court action.Â  Second, while it is true that GEICO may need to meet an increased burden of proof, GEICO maintains the ability to protect any economic interest which may be affected by the family court action.Â  Although the rules of joinder and intervention are to be liberally construed, permitting GEICO to join in a family court action in which it has no real interest stretches beyond liberal constructionÂ  and creates a situation in which any party with a remotely tangential interest will be allowed to interject themselves into pending litigation.Â  We do not interpret the rules to allow such manipulation.\r\nFor these reasons, we hold that the family court did not err in denying GEICOâ€™s petition to join the family court action pursuant to Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  Â Â  Â Â \r\nII.Â  Intervention\r\nGEICO argues that the family court erred in denying its petition to intervene pursuant to Rule 24, SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tRule 24(a), SCRCP provides:\r\n\tUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless the applicantâ€™s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the rules of intervention should be liberally construed where judicial economy will be promoted by declaring the rights of all affected parties.Â  Berkeley Elec. Coop., 302 S.C. at 189, 394 S.E.2d at 714.Â  Accordingly, the Court should consider the practical implications of a decision denying or allowing intervention.Â  Id.Â  Â Â Â  However, a party must have standing to intervene in an action pursuant to Rule 24, SCRCP.Â  Bailey v. Bailey, 312 S.C. 454, 458, 441 S.E.2d 325, 327 (1994).Â  A party has standing if the party has a personal stake in the subject matter of a lawsuit and is a â€œreal party in interest.â€ Â Id.Â  â€œA real party in interest . . . is one who has a real, actual, material or substantial interest in the subject matter of the action, as distinguished from one who has only a nominal, formal, or technical interest in, or connection with, the action.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).\r\nWe find that GIECO does not have â€œan interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the actionâ€ as required by Rule 24(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  Additionally, we hold that the family court correctly found GEICO lacked standing because GEICO does not have an interest in the subject matter of the family court action.Â  Stated differently, GEICO has no real interest in whether Cooper and Goethe have a valid common law marriage.Â  GEICOâ€™s interest is in the financial implications of the family courtâ€™s decision, which is peripheral to the subject matter before the court.Â  This interest is insufficient to warrant GEICOâ€™s intervention in Cooperâ€™s family court action under Rule 24(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  \r\nGEICO claims that this Courtâ€™s decision in Bailey is inapplicable and distinguishable from the case at hand.Â  In Bailey, the former wifeâ€™s prior attorneys moved to intervene in a divorce proceeding for the purposes of challenging the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement.Â  Id. at 454, 441 S.E.2d at 325.Â Â  The Court found that the attorneys did not have standing to intervene because the order directing payment from the former husband to the former wife in care of attorneys did not direct payment of fees and that the attorneys could litigate fee disputes in an alternative forum.Â  Id.Â  The Court further stated that intervention is only appropriate where the party seeking intervention has â€œa real proprietary interest in the subject matter of the proceedings;â€ an interest which is merely â€œperipheral and not the real interest at stakeâ€ will not warrant intervention.Â  Id.\r\nGEICOâ€™s purported distinction is not persuasive.Â  Similarly to the analysis in Bailey, we find that the subject matter of the family court action in the instant case is the validity of a common law marriage, which does not involve a determination of insurance benefits.Â  Accordingly, GEICO does not have standing to intervene in the family court action because it does not have an interest sufficiently related to the subject matter of the action.Â  \r\nFor these reasons, we hold that the family court did not err in denying GEICOâ€™s petition to intervene in Cooperâ€™s family court action.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the family courtâ€™s order denying GEICOâ€™s petition to join or intervene in Cooperâ€™s family court action.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a \r\nseparate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent, and would hold the family court judge erred in declining GEICOâ€™s petition for joinder under Rule 19, SCRCP, and that he abused his discretion in denying GEICOâ€™s petition to intervene under Rule 24, SCRCP.\r\nRespondent Cooper claimed that he was a Class I insured under an automobile policy appellant GEICO issued to respondent Goethe.Â  GEICO denied Cooperâ€™s claim, and brought a declaratory judgment action in circuit court to determine Cooperâ€™s rights, if any, under the Goethe policy.Â  By filing this circuit court action, GEICO undertook the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Cooper was not a Class I insured under Goetheâ€™s policy.Â  Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Singleton, 316 S.C. 5, 446 S.E.2d 417 (1994).\r\nAfter GEICOâ€™s circuit court suit was commenced, Cooper brought a family court action against Goethe to establish that they had entered a common law marriage.Â  Cooperâ€™s declaratory judgment suit was brought pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-1-520 (1985) which provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhen the validity of a marriage shall be denied or doubted by either of the parties, \r\n\t[1] the other may institute a suit for affirming the marriage and, upon due proof of the validity thereof, it shall be decreed to be valid \r\n\tand such decree shall be conclusive upon all persons concerned.\r\n\t(emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nFor purposes of this appeal, the critical part of Â§ 20-1-520 is the last phrase: â€œupon due proof of the validity thereof, [the marriage] shall be decreed to be valid and such decree shall be conclusive upon all persons concerned.â€Â  An adjudication of a valid marriage under this statute is â€œconclusive upon the worldâ€ and can only be attacked by a non-party to the judgment upon grounds of fraud.Â  Headen v. Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc., 252 F.2d 739 (3rd Cir. 1958).Â  Accordingly, if GEICO is not permitted to participate in this family court adjudication, and that court determines that Cooper and Goethe are lawfully married, GEICO will no longer be required to prove in circuit court that there is no marriage by a preponderance of the evidence, but will instead need to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that Cooper procured the family court judgment by fraud.Â  See Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 529 S.E.2d 714 (2000).Â  Keeping this increased burden of proof in mind, I turn to the issues raised by GEICO in this appeal.\r\nA.Â  Rule 19, SCRCP\r\nGEICO first contends the family court erred in denying its petition for joinder under Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  I agree.Â  Rule 19(a) provides:\r\n\r\n\t(a)Â  Person to Be Joined if Feasible.Â  A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.Â  If he has not been so joined, the court shall order that he be made a party.Â  If he should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.\r\n\r\nRule 19(a) is the same as Rule 19(a), FRCP,[2] and expresses the principle that â€œwhenever possible persons materially interested in the action should be joined so that they may be heard and a complete determination had.â€Â  Notes, Rule 19, SCRCP.\r\nThe majority first holds that GEICO has no real interest in the family court action as its economic interest in the Goethe policy is â€œmerely tangential.â€ In my view, GEICO â€œclaims an interest relating to the subject of the [family court] action,â€ whether there is a valid marriage, which is all that Rule 19(a)(2) requires.Â  Further, as explained above, should the family court hold that Cooper and Goethe have entered a common law marriage, that finding will be conclusive against GEICO, unless it can prove by clear and convincing evidence, that the judgment was procured by fraud.Â  I would find GEICOâ€™s exclusion from the family court suit may â€œas a practical matter impair or impede [its] ability to protect that interest.â€ \r\nMoreover, since we have no state precedent interpreting Rule 19, SCRCP, we may look to federal precedent.[3]Â  See Gardner v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, 304 S.C. 328, 404 S.E.2d 200 (1991).Â  I note that Rule 19(a), SCRCP, does not contain the term â€œnecessary party.â€Â  That term was intentionally omitted when Rule 19, FRCP, was amended in 1966, and South Carolina chose to model its rule on the amended version of the federal rules.Â  As the commentators explain, the term was omitted in order to encourage courts to make pragmatic decisions concerning joinder.Â  See Wright Miller Kane 7 Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 1601.Â  \r\nRule 19(a)(2), SCRCP asks first, whether the party seeking joinder claims an interest relating to the subject of the action, which I would find GEICO does.Â  Second, it asks whether that party is in such a position that disposition of the action in his absence may, as a practical matter, impair or impede his ability to protect that interest.Â  I would find GEICO meets this criterion.\r\nI would hold that GEICO has met the requirement for Rule 19(a) joinder, and that the family court erred in failing to grant its petition.\r\nB.Â  Rule 24, SCRCP\r\nGEICO next argues that the family court erred in denying its request to intervene made pursuant to Rule 24, SCRCP.Â  I agree.\r\nRule 24(a)(2) provides for intervention of right:\r\n\r\n\twhen the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless the applicantâ€™s interest is adequately represented by existing parties. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a Rule 24(a)(2) motion is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, and each case is viewed in the context of its unique facts and circumstances.Â  Berkely Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 302 S.C. 186, 394 S.E.2d 712 (1990).Â  â€œWe interpret [Rule 24(a)(2)] to permit liberal intervention particularly where, as here, judicial economy will be promoted by the declaration of the rights of all parties who may be affected.â€Â  Id.Â  In determining whether intervention is warranted, â€œwe must consider the pragmatic consequences of a decision to permit or deny intervention and avoid setting up rigid applications of [the rule].â€Â  Id.\r\nFor the reasons given in the preceding section, I would find that GEICO meets the intervention criteria of Rule 24(a)(2).Â  Furthermore, I cannot reconcile the standing discussion in Bailey v. Bailey, 312 S.C. 454, 441 S.E.2d 325 (1994) with my understanding of Rule 24.Â  As I read Bailey, there is no discussion of Rule 24(a)(2), and it is patent that the Court conducted no rule-based analysis.Â  In my opinion, if a party meets the requirements of Rule 24(a)(2), that is, it is entitled to intervene as a matter of right, then it ipso facto has â€œstanding.â€Â  Bailey may have reached the correct result, but its discussion of intervention as an issue of â€œstandingâ€ rather than as a matter governed by Rule 24, SCRCP, is simply misdirected.Â  I would hold the family court abused its discretion in denying GEICOâ€™s request to intervene under Rule 24 (a)(2).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nI would reverse, and allow GEICO to participate in the family court action.Â  Under the somewhat unusual facts and procedural posture of this appeal, such a â€œpragmaticâ€ result will allow the issue of a common law marriage to be resolved in a single suit. \r\n\r\n[1] Given Ms. Goetheâ€™s non-participation in this appeal, it would appear that neither she nor Cooper truly denies or doubts the marriage.\r\n[2] And differs significantly from that of former S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-200, which is the basis for the definition of â€œnecessary partyâ€ in Slatton v. Slatton, 289 S.C. 128, 345 S.E.2d 248 (1986).Â  That statute provided:\r\n\r\n\tÂ§ 15-5-200.Â  New parties; interpleader.\r\n\tThe court may determine any controversy between the parties before it, when it can be done without prejudice to the rights of others, or by saving their rights.Â  But when a complete determination of the controversy cannot be had without the presence of other parties, the court must cause them to be brought in.Â  And when, in an action for the recovery of real or personal property, a person not a party to the action but having an interest in the subject thereof makes application to the court to be made a party it may order him to be brought in by proper amendment.\r\n\tA defendant against whom an action is pending upon a contract or for specific real or personal property may, at any time before answer, upon affidavit that a person not a party to the action and without collusion by him makes against him a demand for the same debt or property and upon due notice to such person and the adverse party, apply to the court for an order to substitute such a person in his place and discharge him from liability to either party on his depositing in court the amount of the debt or delivering the property, or its value, to such a person as the court may direct.Â  The court may, in its discretion, make such an order.\r\n\r\n[3]Unlike the majority, I do not read Slatton as interpreting, defining, or applying Rule 19. See Slatton, fn. 1:Â  â€œAfter the trial of this action, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-200 (1976) was repealed by Act.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n\t\t\t\tSenior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant was found guilty on charges of armed robbery and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN).Â  He was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for armed robbery and ten years imprisonment for ABHAN.Â  The terms were to be served concurrently.Â  His appeal was certified from the Court of Appeals.\r\nAppellant was identified as the robber of a pizza delivery woman.Â  On a sunny afternoon, the victim arrived at a house to deliver a pizza but no one answered the door.Â  She heard the back door of the house slam so she went behind the house.Â  She saw two black males coming towards her.Â  The male walking in front, later identified as appellant, looked angry.Â  The victim stated he came towards her and pulled a gun from behind his back and demanded money.Â  The assailant pulled the victim by her shirt towards the back of the home.Â  The victim told the assailant to take her money and he did so by pulling money out of her pocket.Â  The victim was then told to lie down on the ground.Â  While on the ground, the assailant held the gun beside her head.Â  After a few moments, the assailant and the other male left.Â  Based on the victimâ€™s identification of appellant as her assailant, appellant was found guilty of armed robbery and ABHAN.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the court err by admitting identification \r\n\t\t\ttestimony where the photographic line-up was unduly suggestive?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the court err by sending written charges to the \r\n\t\t\tjury?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the court err by limiting the cross-examination \r\n\t\t\tof the victim by not allowing questions regarding her schizophrenia \r\n\t\t\tdiagnosis, her treatment, and her medications?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Identification\r\nPrior to trial, a suppression hearing was held regarding the victimâ€™s pre-trial identification of appellant.Â  The victim testified about how the crimes occurred and described her assailant by stating he was â€œfairly tall,â€ â€œbuilt pretty good,â€ did not have a shirt on, and he â€œwas dark.â€Â  She stated she went to the law enforcement center the same day to look at pictures in a line-up.Â  She stated Investigator Wes Smith did not instruct her she must choose someone and did not tell her that the person who attacked her was in the line-up.Â  She stated he told her to only choose someone if she was sure.Â  She testified she chose appellant as her assailant.\r\nInvestigator Smith testified at the suppression hearing.Â  He stated appellant voluntarily came in and had his photograph taken.Â  Smith placed appellantâ€™s picture with five other pictures of similar-looking males and showed the pictures to the victim.Â  Prior to presenting the pictures, Smith told the victim that the suspects may or may not be one of the people in the photographs and that he wanted her to look at the photographs and identify someone only if she was sure beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  He stated she indicated she understood his instructions.Â  The victim identified appellant after looking only momentarily at the pictures.\r\nOn cross-examination, Investigator Smith stated he pulled the other five pictures from his photographic database and that he tried to choose people that had a similarly shaped face with some facial hair because the assailant had some facial hair.Â  He stated he did not pay attention to the contrast of the background but just tried to choose people who looked similar.Â  He admitted that four pictures had purple backgrounds and two pictures had gray backgrounds.Â  He stated he did not have any choice in the use of the gray background in appellantâ€™s picture.\r\nFollowing the testimony, appellant objected that the photo line-up was suggestive in that only two of the persons in the line-up can be identified as dark-skinned due to the use of the light background.Â  The court ruled that, while there were some differences in the photographs, there will always be differences.Â  The court ruled the line-up was not unduly suggestive.\r\nAt trial, the victim testified regarding the photo line-up.Â  Over appellantâ€™s objection, the photo line-up was admitted into evidence.Â  Following that exchange, the victim then identified appellant as her assailant.\r\nAppellant argues the line-up was suggestive because, due to the different color background, appellantâ€™s picture stands out from all but one other picture.[1]\r\nA criminal defendant may be deprived of due process of law by an identification procedure which is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.Â  State v. Traylor, 360 S.C. 74, 600 S.E.2d 523 (2004).[2]Â  An in-court identification of an accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court identification procedure created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.Â  Id.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong inquiry to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.Â  Id. (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972)).Â  A court must ascertain whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  Id.Â  Even assuming an identification procedure is suggestive, it need not be excluded so long as, under all the circumstances, the identification was reliable notwithstanding the suggestiveness.Â  State v. Traylor, supra.Â  The inquiry must focus upon whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there was a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.Â  Id. Â The following factors should be considered in evaluating the totality of the circumstances to determine the likelihood of a misidentification: Â (1) the witnessâ€™s opportunity to view the perpetrator at the time of the crime, (2) the witnessâ€™s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s prior description of the perpetrator, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.Â  Id.\r\nThe photo line-up here is not unduly suggestive.Â  Despite the variation in the background colors, appellant does not stand out in comparison with the other individuals in the line-up.Â  All six men have facial hair and all appear to be â€œbuilt,â€ as described by the victim.Â  The gray background does not make appellantâ€™s complexion seem darker than the complexions of the other four individuals who have purple backgrounds.Â  Accordingly, the photo line-up is not unduly suggestive.Â  See, e.g., United States v. Lincoln, 494 F.2d 833 (9th Cir. 1974) (fact appellantâ€™s photo was in color and photos of the other individuals in the line-up were in black and white is not impermissibly suggestive); Burgess v. State, 827 So.2d 134 (Ala. Crim. App. 1998), affâ€™d, 827 So.2d 193 (Ala. 2000) (fact appellant was wearing a dark jacket or that he was standing before a blank wall while others were standing in front of a curtain did not render line-up unduly suggestive); State v. Holmes, 931 So.2d 1157 (La. App. 4th Cir. 2006) (fact appellantâ€™s photo was placed in the top center position of a line-up and had a lighter background shade than the other photos did not render the line-up unduly suggestive); State v. Gullett, 633 S.W.2d 454 (Mo. App. 1982) (fact appellantâ€™s photo was in color and was slightly larger than other photos, which were in black and white, did not render the line-up unduly suggestive).\r\nRegardless of whether the photo line-up was suggestive, the identification was reliable.Â  The victim had an ample opportunity to view her assailant at the time of the crime.Â  The crime occurred outside during a sunny afternoon.Â  The victim had a full facial view of him while he asked her questions.Â  Her degree of attention was manifested by the description she gave police.Â  Her description included the details that the assailant was tall, was built, was not wearing a shirt, was dark, and had some facial hair.Â  This description she gave police matched the photograph she chose from the line-up.Â  The victim had a high degree of certainty regarding her identification because she looked at the photographs only momentarily before identifying appellant.Â  Finally, the time between the crime and the confrontation was very short as the line-up occurred on the same day as the crime.Â  All of these factors point to the reliability of the victimâ€™s identification of appellant as her assailant.Â  Even assuming the line-up was suggestive due to the different background colors, there is not a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly admitted the identification.\r\nII. Submission of Written Charge to the Jury\r\nAt the conclusion of the courtâ€™s charge to the jury, the court informed the jury they would receive a written copy of his charge in the jury room.Â  Following the attorneysâ€™ review of the charge, appellant objected.Â  The court submitted the written charge to the jury without addressing appellantâ€™s objection.Â  Appellant argues the trial court erred by sending the jury charge in written form to the jury.\r\nA trial court may, in its discretion, submit its instructions on the law to the jury in writing.Â  Cf. Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000) (an appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions unless the trial court abused its discretion); see State v. McAvoy, 417 S.E.2d 489 (N.C. 1992) (trial court has inherent authority, in its discretion, to submit its instructions on the law to the jury in writing).\r\nFurther, appellant has not shown how he was prejudiced by the courtâ€™s alleged error.Â  See State v. Douglas, 369 S.C. 424, 632 S.E.2d 845&nbsp;(2006) (appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result).Â  Although no error was made in the instant case, we remind the Bench that the submission of written instructions to the jury is not appropriate for every case.Â  While the written submission of the jury instructions could aid a jury in properly applying the law to the facts before it, this practice should be carefully exercised by the Bench.\r\nIII.Â  Limitation of Cross-examination\r\nPrior to trial, the State moved to preclude appellant from using the terms â€œschizophreniaâ€ or referring to that particular diagnosis during appellantâ€™s cross-examination of the victim.Â  Before determining whether the testimony should be limited, the court allowed an in camera cross-examination of the victim.Â  The victim testified she has schizophrenia and that she takes Prozac and Risperdal for that condition.Â  She stated that if she does not take her medication she becomes confused, hears voices, and has problems with her memory.Â  However, she indicated she was taking her medication on the date of the crimes.Â  The court asked her if she had been without her medicine either during the time of the crimes or anytime recently and the victim stated she had not.\r\nThe court found there would be very little that would assist the jury in evaluating her ability to recall what happened or her credibility.Â  The court felt it would require speculation on the juryâ€™s part to connect the medical testimony to her ability to testify truthfully.Â  The court stated there was a significant potential for unfair prejudice because it may cause the jury to decide the case on an improper basis.\r\nAppellant then requested that he be allowed to ask the following questions:Â  Do you take medication?Â  What do you take?Â  If you do not take your medication over a long period of time, what is your condition?Â  The court stated that the identification of the medicines is prejudicial because it is medication that people associate with mental illness and that the naming of those medicines would not add any probative value.Â  The court asked the questions in camera and concluded that questioning the victim regarding the names of her medicines should not be allowed under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The court then allowed the State to reopen its direct examination of the victim.\r\nOn direct, the victim stated she took medication and that she was taking it on the day of the robbery.Â  On cross-examination, the victim indicated that if she does not take her medication over a period of time she gets confused, is forgetful, and can hear voices.\r\nAppellant argues the court erred by not allowing him to question the victim regarding her diagnosis of schizophrenia and the names of her medications.\r\nThe right to a meaningful cross-examination of an adverse witness is included in the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers.Â  State v. Saltz,&nbsp;346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001). Â This does not mean, however, that trial courts conducting criminal trials lose their usual discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination.Â  Id.Â  On the contrary, trial courts retain wide latitude, insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned, to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, prejudice, confusion of the issues, or interrogation that is only marginally relevant.Â  Id.\r\nThe courtâ€™s limitation on the cross-examination of the victim was reasonable.Â  Because the victim was taking her medication at the time of the robbery and at the time of the trial, her schizophrenia diagnosis and the types of medications she was taking were irrelevant to her ability to truthfully recall the events.Â  Further, appellant has not shown why the specific information was needed or any nexus between the medications the victim was taking and any alleged misidentification of appellant.\r\nIn any event, the victim testified she takes medication and what happens if she does not take her medication.Â  The jury was made aware that the victim is required to be medicated and that if she does not take her medication she is confused, forgetful, and can hear voices.Â  Although appellant could not elicit testimony about the victimâ€™s specific mental illness and her specific medication, the gist of what appellant wished to elicit from her testimony was elicited.Â  Therefore, appellant has not shown he was unfairly prejudiced by the limitation.Â  Cf. State v. Mizzell,&nbsp;349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002) (if the defendant establishes he was unfairly prejudiced by the limitation on cross-examination, it is reversible error).Â  The court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the victimâ€™s cross-examination.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the photo line-up in this case was not unduly suggestive and, even assuming the line-up was suggestive, we find the victimâ€™s identification of appellant to be reliable.Â  We further find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by submitting his written charge to the jury.Â  Finally, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting appellantâ€™s cross-examination of the victim.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Appellant further argues that the fact the victim was shown the photo line-up two more times in court prior to her in-court identification of him multiplies the suggestive impact of the photo line-up.Â  However, when the victim identified appellant as her assailant in the courtroom, he did not object.Â  Therefore, appellantâ€™s argument regarding the in-court identification is not preserved for review.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 587 S.E.2d 691&nbsp;(2003) (issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal).\r\n[2]Cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1063 (2005). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26317","title":"Majors v.

Meyers, both of Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  We certified this case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204 (b), SCACR.Â Â  The South Carolina Securities Exchange Commission ordered Appellants, Ned Majors and Tax Lien Agents, Inc. (collectively TLA), to â€œCease and Desist Selling Unregistered Securities and Engaging in Securities Fraud.â€Â  TLA appeals, contending it is not engaged in the sale of â€œsecurities.â€ Â We disagree and therefore affirm.Â Â  \r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nNed Majors is President and sole shareholder of TLA, a South Carolina Corporation operating in Myrtle Beach since 1998.Â Â  TLAâ€™s business centers around the purchase of tax lien certificates (TLCs) at city and county tax lien auctions throughout the country.Â  Pursuant to TLAâ€™s â€œAgency Contract,â€ TLA is the purchasing agent for its Principals.Â Â  TLA Agents make all purchasing decisions, and they bid competitively for purchases at auctions by offering to accept a lower interest rate than the statutory rate to which purchasers would otherwise be entitled.Â Â  Pursuant to the contract, the Agent bids on tax liens which TLA believes have a reasonable prospect of not being redeemed.Â  The Principal agrees to pay Agent a â€œnon-refundable agency feeâ€ (between 12-25% of the principalâ€™s initial tax lien purchase amount) and grants TLA an inchoate interest of 50% ownership in any unredeemed TLCs.Â  \r\nFor each TLC purchased on a principalâ€™s behalf, the principal gives the Agent a cashiers check (or a Trust directive if using a trust) made payable to the â€œCounty Treasurer for Tax Liens.â€Â Â  The TLCs purchased are listed in the principalâ€™s name.Â  If a TLC is redeemed before its maturity date (usually 1-3 years), the Principal keeps all redemption monies, including interest and penalties; however, if the TLC is not redeemed, the Principal agrees to immediately sign papers to assign, convey and register the property, and to confirm the Agent has a 50% ownership interest in the net profit of the TLC and any resultant deed issued.Â  The Principal is required (unless agreed upon with the Agent) to commence good faith efforts to quiet the title and sell the property.Â  Although Principals have the right to select closing attorneys and quiet title, etc., they very seldom do so as the majority are absentee owners living a considerable distance from the properties; the majority use TLAâ€™s services to facilitate both the sale and quieting title.Â  Although TLA represents only one principal for each TLC purchased, an agent represents 15-20 principals (also referred to as â€œemployersâ€) at each tax sale or as many as 200 â€œemployersâ€ over a two week period.Â  \r\nIf a Principal wishes to sell TLCs, the Agent has first right of refusal, and if the TLC is sold to any other party, the third party must agree to the same contract terms as the Principal.Â  If either party elects, the underlying property which was not redeemed may be purchased by paying 50% of the average of three appraisals.Â Â  The agency contract also states that â€œwhile there are no risks in owning government sold and issued TLCs that are redeemed (paid off), there are potential down side financial risks if a TLC matures into a property deed as the underlying property market value could substantially drop during the tax lien maturity period.â€Â  \r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn September 2003, the Attorney General, acting as the South Carolina Securities Exchange Commissioner (Commissioner), entered an order for Majors and TLA to â€œCease and Desist Selling Unregistered Securities and Engaging in Securities Fraudâ€ and gave them notice of a right to a hearing.Â  The Commissioner appointed G. Marcus Knight as the Administrative Hearing Officer for the matter, and a public hearing was held on Oct 30-31, 2003.Â  Thereafter, Knight issued a detailed report and recommendation concluding that 1) the South Carolina Uniform Securities Act (the Act) applied because TLA was engaged in the sale of â€œsecuritiesâ€ as defined in that Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-20 (15) because its contract constituted an â€œinvestment contract.â€Â Â  The Hearing Officer also rejected TLA and Majorsâ€™ contention that the manner of issuance of the cease and desist order deprived them of due process, or that their due process rights were violated by his appointment as Hearing Officer.Â  The Hearing Officer concluded that the Commissioner should order a final Cease and Desist Order, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-60, due to a violation of the registration requirements Â§ 35-1-810 of the Act.Â  However, the Commissioner opined the Final Order should exclude any reference to TLA making â€œmaterial misrepresentations and/or omissionsâ€ in connection with its sale of TLCs, and should not pursue any criminal or civil penalties.Â  \r\nIn February 2004, the Commissioner issued a â€œFinal Order to Cease and Desist Selling Unregistered Securities.â€Â  The Commissioner found TLAâ€™s investment opportunity constituted a â€œsecurityâ€ under the Act and also found a violation of the registration requirements Â§ 35-1-810.Â  TLA and Majors were ordered to cease and desist from offering or selling the TLC investment opportunity in or from the State of South Carolina.Â  The final order did not find TLA was engaged in securities fraud.Â  \r\nMajors and TLA appealed to the circuit court which ruled 1) the investment opportunity offered was a security, 2) the SEC Commission had authority to issue the original cease and desist order, and 3) Majors and TLA were afforded due process in the underlying administrative proceeding.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tWhat is the proper standard of review?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the SEC have authority to issue the initial \r\n\t\t\tcease and desist order?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tWere Appellants afforded due process in the underlying administrative proceeding?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4. \r\n\t\t\tWere Appellants properly ordered to cease and desist from the sale of unregistered securities in violation of the S.C. Uniform Securities Act?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n1.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe issue in this case involves a decision of whether TLAâ€™s sale of TLCs constitutes the sale of securities.Â  We find this is a novel question of law, such that we are free to decide the issue with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  Baggerly v. CSX Transp. Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 635 S.E.2d 97 2006), citing Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000).Â  \r\n2.Â  INITIAL CEASE AND DESIST ORDER\r\nTLA asserts the Commissioner had no statutory authority to enter the initial Cease and Desist order, such that the whole proceeding should be voided for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nThis issue is not one of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 236, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994); State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  \r\nIn any event, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-60 (2004 Supp), as it read at the time this matter arose, stated in pertinent part, â€œThe Securities Commissioner may make, amend, and rescind those rules, forms, and orders, including cease and desist orders, as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. . .â€Â Â Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\nAs originally written, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-60 did not allow the Commissioner to issue cease and desist orders.Â  It was amended in 1992 to permit the Commissioner to make, amend, and rescind those rules, forms, and orders, including cease and desist orders. . .â€Â  1992 Act No. 451 Â§ 1, eff. June 15, 1992.Â  We find it was within the Commissionerâ€™s authority to issue the initial cease and desist order.[1]Â Â  \r\n3.Â  DUE PROCESS\r\nTLA and Majors next assert issuance of the cease and desist order in violated their rights to due process.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe initial cease and desist order, prior to a hearing, was permissible.Â  See Ross v. MUSC, 328 S.C. 51, 72, 492 S.E.2d 62, 69 (1997) (Article I, Â§ 22, requires an administrative agency provide notice and an opportunity to be heard, but does not require notice and an opportunity to be heard at each level of the administrative process. It mandates notice and opportunity to be heard at some point before the agency makes its final decision). \r\nMoreover, contrary to TLAâ€™s contention, we find no due process violation in the SEC Commissionerâ€™s role in this matter.Â  \r\nIn Ross v. MUSC, 328 S.C. 51, 492 S.E.2d 62 (1997), we held the purpose of S.C. Const., Art. I, Â§ 22 is to ensure adjudications are conducted by impartial administrative bodies.Â  Partiality exists where an adjudicator either has ex parte information as a result of prior investigation or has developed, by prior involvement with the case, a â€œwill to win.â€Â  Ross, 328 S.C. at 69, 492 S.E.2d at 72.Â Â  In Ross, we found no violation of Section 22 where MUSCâ€™s president investigated a tenured professorâ€™s conduct, terminated the professor, and then testified against him at a committee hearing.Â  We found no due process violation because the president did not later participate as an adjudicator, and he did not improperly consider ex parte information.Â  Id. at 70, 492 S.E.2d at 72.[2] \r\nIn Garris v. Governing Board of S.C. Reinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 511 S.E.2d 48 (1998), this Court recognized, â€œthe fact that investigative, prosecutorial, and adjudicative functions are performed within the same agency, or even performed by the same persons within an agency, does not, without more, constitute a violation of due process.â€Â  333 S.C. 443, 511 S.E.2d at 54.Â  In that case, Garris was a designated insurance agent for the South Carolina Reinsurance Facility.Â  The Facility began investigating Garris, alleging irregularities in his underwriting practices.Â  After a hearing, the Governing Board of the Facility voted to revoke Garrisâ€™ status as a designated agent.Â  Garris appealed, contesting the composition of the Board which revoked his designation.Â  In Garris, the five Governing board members and one non-member of the South Carolina Reinsurance Facility attended one or more committee meetings at which Garrisâ€™ case was discussed extensively in open and executive sessions, and all six voted to revoke Garrisâ€™ status as a designated agent.Â Â  Of those six, four were members of the committees which considered the Garris matter.Â  Further, two other Governing Board members attended committee meetings and the hearing, but did not vote.Â  We concluded the procedure violated due process, stating:\r\n\r\n\twe conclude that Governing Board members who participate in the investigation or prosecution of a designated agent as a member or observer at a committee meeting may not participate as adjudicators of that agentâ€™s case at a subsequent hearing. Members who participate in the investigation or prosecution of a case must distance themselves from the adjudicatory process, and should refrain from even discussing that case with future adjudicators. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n333 S.C. at 446, 511 S.E.2d at 55.\r\nGarris and Ross are distinguishable from the present case.Â  Unlike those cases, the Commissioner did, in this instance, appoint a Hearing Officer to take evidence and make a report and recommendation.Â  Further, the Commissioner did not personally participate in the gathering of the evidence before the Hearing Officer, and there is no evidence he discussed the underlying case with the Hearing Officer.Â  \r\nMoreover, we find the power of the SEC Commissioner is akin to this Courtâ€™s power to issue an order of interim suspension of an attorney, and then, after an investigation by the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and a Report and Recommendation, issue the ultimate sanction.Â  See Kirven v. Board of Grievances and Discipline, 271 S.C. 194, 246 S.E.2d 857 (1978) (members of Board of Grievance are officers of this Court commissioned and charged by this Court with the duty of investigating alleged acts of professional misconduct on the part of their fellow members of the bar, and of reporting to this Court the proceedings of their inquiry, their findings and recommendations); Matter of Iseman, 356 S.C. 280, 588 S.E.2d 606 (2003) (Supreme Court holds ultimate authority to sanction attorneys).Â  \r\nWe find TLA and Majors have been afforded due process in this matter.Â Â  The initial cease and desist order provided them with the right to a hearing, which they requested and were afforded by an independent Hearing Officer.Â  Thereafter, they were permitted to appeal the SEC Commissionerâ€™s Final Cease and Desist Order, and were allowed to post a bond to stay enforcement of that order pending appeal.Â  The order has further been stayed by this appeal.Â  \r\n4.Â  SECURITY\r\nFinally, TLA asserts that its sale of TLCs does not involve the sale of a security, and it is therefore not in violation of the Act, because it was not required to register under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-810 (1987) (making it unlawful to sell any security in this state unless it is either registered or exempt).Â  We disagree.Â  The Commissioner and the circuit court properly held the sale of TLCs in this case constituted the sale of â€œsecuritiesâ€ within the meaning of the Act.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-20 (12), as it read at time of the cease and desist order, defined a â€œsecurityâ€ as, inter alia, â€œany certificate of interest or participation in any . . . investment contract . . . or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a security . . .â€Â Â  \r\nAs noted by the Court of Appeals in Garrett v. Snedigar, 293 S.C. 176, 180, 359 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1987), overruled on other grounds, Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 580 S.E.2d 440 (2003), â€œin construing the state Act, [the Court] may look for guidance to cases construing its federal counterpart.â€Â  In Garrett, the Court of Appeals recognized that both our Act and the Federal Act define the word â€œsecurityâ€ to include any â€œcertificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, [or] investment contract.â€Â  The Court of Appeals cited the seminal United States Supreme Court case of Securities and Exchange Commission v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, rehâ€™g denied, 329 U.S. 819 (1946) in which the Court defined an investment contract as a â€œtransaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.â€Â  Id. at 298-299.Â  \r\nUnder the Howey test, an investment contract exists where there has been (i) an investment of money, (ii) in a common enterprise, (iii) with an expectation of profits garnered solely from the efforts of others.Â  See Teague v. Bakker, 35 F.3d 978, 986 (4th Cir.1994). The test is a flexible one, â€œcapable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.â€Â  Howey, 328 U.S. at 299.\r\nWe find the Commissioner and the circuit court properly found TLAâ€™s sale of TLCs constitutes the sale of an â€œinvestment contract,â€ such that under Â§ 35-1-20 (12), it constitutes a security and therefore TLA and Majors were properly ordered to cease and desist from the sale absent proper registration with the SEC Commission.Â  \r\na.Â  Investment of Money\r\nAn â€œinvestment of moneyâ€ under Howey means the investor must have committed his assets to the enterprise in such a manner as to subject himself to financial loss.Â  SEC v. Pinckney, 923 F. Supp. 76, 80 (E.D. NC 1996). \r\nIt is indisputable that Principals meet this test.Â  They paid an up-front, non-refundable agency fee of 12-25 % of their TLC purchase price, they paid all fees and expenses associated with the purchase of the TLCs, as well as the expenses associated with establishing clear title to those properties which were not redeemed, and agreed to pay TLA 50% of the profits from the sale of any properties which were not redeemed.Â  It cannot seriously be argued that Principals here did not make an investment of money.Â  \r\nTLA also asserts Principals were not subject to financial loss.Â  However, its contract specifically states that, â€œwhile there are no risks in owning government sold and issued TLCs that are redeemed (paid off), there are potential down side financial risks if a TLC matures into a property deed as the underlying property market value could substantially drop during the tax lien maturity period.â€Â  Accordingly, we find the first prong of Howey is met inasmuch as there is an â€œinvestment of money.â€\r\nb.Â  Common Enterprise Test\r\nTLA next contends the Commissioner, and the circuit court, erred in applying a â€œstrict vertical commonalityâ€ test to determine whether it is engaged in a common enterprise.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to meet the â€œcommon enterpriseâ€ prong of the Howey test, courts around the country have struggled with discerning whether vertical or horizontal commonality, or both, must exist. See Top of Iowa Cooperative v. Schewe, 6 F.Supp.2d 843, 852 (N.D. Iowa 1998) (noting that the Eighth Circuit had not ruled on whether either vertical or horizontal commonality or both are required under the â€œcommon enterpriseâ€ prong of Howey, such that the court examined the contracts for either kind of commonality); see also S.E.C. v. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir.2001) (citing and discussing the different standards in courts across the country); S.E.C. v. Pinckney, 923 F.Supp. 76, 81 (E.D.N.C. 1996) (same).Â  As a general guide, vertical commonality requires only a pooling of the interests of the developer or promoter and each individual investor, while â€œhorizontal commonalityâ€ requires as well a pooling of interests among the investors.Â  Schewe, 6 F.Supp.2d at 852 (citing Wals v. Fox Hills Development Corp., 24 F.3d 1016, 1017-18 (7th Cir. 1994)).Â  See also SEC v. Alpha Telcom, Inc., 187 F.Supp. 2d 1250 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding the second element of the Howey test can be satisfied by the existence of either vertical commonality or horizontal commonality. Vertical commonality is the dependence of the investorsâ€™ fortunes on the success or expertise of the promoter. Horizontal commonality is the pooling of investor funds and interests.Â  CitingBrodt v. Bache &amp; Co., Inc., 595 F.2d 459, 460 (9th Cir. 1978).)\r\nThe courts have further identified two kinds of vertical commonality: broad vertical commonality and strict vertical commonality.Â  To establish â€œbroad vertical commonality,â€ the fortunes of the investors need be linked only to the efforts of the promoter.Â  See Long v. Shultz Cattle Co., Inc., 881 F.2d 129, 140-41 (5th Cir.1989). Â â€œStrict vertical commonalityâ€ requires the fortunes of investors be tied to the fortunes of the promoter.Â  Brodt v. Bache &amp; Co. \r\nTLA asserts the only proper test is horizontal commonality which, by its nature, requires a pooling of interest among investors.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note that many courts have applied an â€œeither/orâ€ test of vertical and horizontal commonality such that there is a common enterprise if either test is met.Â  See e.g. Integrated Research Svcs. v. Illinois Sec. of State, 765 N.E.2d 130 (Ill. 2002); SEC v. Parkersburg Wireless LLC, 991 F.Supp. 6 (D. Col. 1997); Securities and Exchange Commission v. R.G. Reynolds Enterprises, Inc., 952 F.2d 1125 (9th Cir.1991).\r\nWe find the newly revised Uniform Securities Act lend guidance to resolution of this issue.Â  The comments to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-102 (29)(D) state, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\tThe courts have divided over the interpretation of the â€œcommon enterpriseâ€&quot; element of an investment contract. The courts generally recognize that â€œhorizontalâ€ commonality (for example, the pooling of an investment by two or more investors) is a common enterprise. A small minority of the federal circuits will also find a common enterprise in a â€œverticalâ€ relationship when a single investor is dependent upon the expertise of a single commodities broker. Since two or more persons do not share in the profitability of an undertaking, it is difficult to argue that there is a common enterprise. Section 102(29)(D) follows a significantly larger number of federal circuits and adopts a more restrictive form of vertical commonality that occurs only when there is profit sharing between two persons even if, for example, one is a conventional investor and one is a promoter. \r\n\tSee generally 2 Louis Loss &amp; Joel Seligman, Securities Regulation 989-997 (3d ed. Rev. 1999).Â  In interpreting all elements of the investment contract, the courts have emphasized substance, not form.\r\n\r\nClearly, it appears the Legislature intends a strict vertical commonality test to apply.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court and Commissioner applied the proper test.\r\nTLA and Majors also assert that, even under a strict vertical commonality test, the Commissioner erred in finding a common enterprise because the relationship here is precisely the opposite of that found in cases of strict vertical commonality.Â  It contends for such a relationship to exist, there must be a showing that the investorsâ€™ profits are dependent upon the promoterâ€™s profits whereas, here, TLAâ€™s profits are dependent upon the profits of the principals.Â  Â We disagree.\r\nThe court in SEC v. TLC Investments, 179 F.Supp. 2d 1149, 1156 (D. CA. 2001), specifically rejected such a claim, holding that â€œTLCâ€™s fortunes were inextricably linked to the fortunes of the individual investors.Â  So long as the promoterâ€™s gain is contingent on the investorâ€™s gain, there is a common enterprise.â€ \r\nc.Â  Efforts of others\r\nLastly, TLA asserts that because its Principals have input into purchasing and sales decisions, they do not have â€œan expectation of profits garnered solely from the efforts of others.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nAs noted by the Court of Appeals in Garrett, the third prong of Howey has been relaxed.Â  In Garrett, the Court of Appeals held:\r\n\r\n\tLater cases have eliminated the requirement that one must expect profits solely from the efforts of others in order for an interest to be a security. \r\n\tSee United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 852, \r\n\trehâ€™g denied, 423 U.S. 884 (1975) (the touchstone is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others); \r\n\tOâ€™Quinn v. Beach Associates, 272 S.C. 95, 105, 249 S.E.2d 734, 739 (1978) (investment contracts may be found where the investor has duties that are nominal and insignificant or where the investor lacks any real control over the operation of the enterprise).Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe key determination is whether the promotersâ€™ efforts, not that of the investors, form the â€œessential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise. Â Unique Financial Concepts, 196 F.3d at 1201 (citing SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc., 474 F.2d 476, 482 (9th Cir.1973)).Â Â  See also SEC v. Rubera, 350 F.3d 1084 (9th Cir. 2003) (test is whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise).\r\nWe find the test is met here.Â  As noted in the Commissionâ€™s order, although TLAâ€™s Principals retained some contractual rights of control, in practice their control was very limited.Â  TLA made all of the purchasing decisions, and exercised the majority of control in issues relative to clearing title, picking closing attorneys, etc., because the majority of its investors lived a considerable distance away.Â  As further noted in the Commissionerâ€™s order, TLAâ€™s marketing material indicated â€œwe do all the work.â€Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn summary, we hold the SEC Commissioner has authority to issue initial cease and desist orders prior to a hearing, so long as a hearing is thereafter afforded.Â  Further, we find the procedure utilized here did not violate TLAâ€™s due process rights, and that the final cease and desist order was properly issued because TLAâ€™s sale of tax lien certificates was properly found to be the sale of â€œsecuritiesâ€ within the meaning of the S.C. Uniform Securities Act.Â  Accordingly, the order on appeal is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We note also that, effective Jan. 1, 2006, Chapter 1 of the South Carolina Uniform Securities Act was repealed and replaced with a new Chapter 1, to comport with the Uniform Securities Act promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.Â  Section 35-1-60 has been repealed.Â  In its place, Â§Â§ 35-1-603 and 35-1-604 now govern civil and administrative enforcement of the Act.Â  Section 35-1-603 permits the Commissioner to maintain a civil action in the court of common please.Â  Section 35-1-604 (Supp 2005) states, in pertinent part, as follows: \r\n\r\n\ta) If the Securities Commissioner determines that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter or that a person has materially aided, is materially aiding, or is about to materially aid an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter, the Securities Commissioner may:Â  (1) issue an order directing the person to cease and desist from engaging in the act, practice, or course of business or to take other action necessary or appropriate to comply with this chapter. . . \r\n\t\r\n\r\nClearly, the Commissioner has authority to issue cease and desist orders prior to commencement of a civil proceeding.Â  \r\n[2]Â  However, we did find a violation of Section 22 where the university vice-president investigated the professorâ€™s case, testified as an adverse witness at a committee hearing, and sat as the intermediate judge in a three-step disciplinary procedure.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26318","title":"Chassereau v.

Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-430 (2003) (defining the criminal offense of â€œunlawful communicationâ€).\r\nGlobal-Sun and Darwin moved to compel arbitration of Chassereauâ€™s claims, arguing principally that two documents executed during the course of the sale of the pool required that these claims be arbitrated.[1]Â  The trial court disagreed and denied the motion to compel arbitration.Â  Global-Sun and Darwin appealed.\r\nThe court of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  Chassereau v. Global-Sun Pools, Inc., 363 S.C. 628, 611 S.E.2d 305 (2005).Â  In determining whether Chassereauâ€™s claims were required to be arbitrated, the court of appeals examined only the arbitration clause contained in the Installation Agreement.Â  Id. at 633 n.8, 611 S.E.2d at 307 n.8.Â  The court held that because the trial courtâ€™s order relied only on the arbitration clause in the Installation Agreement, any argument regarding the arbitration clause contained in the Financing Agreement was not preserved for review.Â  Id.Â  Ultimately, the court of appeals agreed with the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that Chassereauâ€™s claims were â€œbased upon tortious conduct of the employees of [Global-Sun Pools] unrelated to the contract,â€ and that the claims did not arise out of or relate to the contract.Â  Id. at 635, 611 S.E.2d at 308.Â  Accordingly, the court held that the arbitration clause in the Installation Agreement did not require that Chassereauâ€™s claims be arbitrated.Â  Id. \r\nGlobal-Sun and Darwin unsuccessfully petitioned the court of appeals to supplement the record on appeal with the Financing Agreement and to grant rehearing in the matter.Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision, and Global-Sun and Darwin present the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the court of appeals err in determining that the Installation Agreementâ€™s arbitration clause did not apply to Chassereauâ€™s claims?\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nUnless the parties provide otherwise, the question of the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination. Â Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â  The determination of whether a claim is subject to arbitration is subject to de novo review.Â  Wellman, Inc. v. Square D Co., 366 S.C. 61, 67, 620 S.E.2d 86, 89 (Ct. App. 2005); United States v. Bankers Ins. Co., 245 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir. 2001).Â Â  Nevertheless, a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if any evidence reasonably supports the findings.Â  Thornton v. Trident Med. Ctr., L.L.C., 357 S.C. 91, 94, 592 S.E.2d 50, 51 (Ct. App. 2003). Â \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nGlobal-Sun and Darwin argue that the court of appeals erred in determining that the Installation Agreementâ€™s arbitration clause did not apply to Chassereauâ€™s claims.Â  We disagree.\r\nBoth state and federal policy favor arbitration of disputes.Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  Unless a court can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to any interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should generally be ordered.Â  Id. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118-119.Â  However, arbitration is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be required to arbitrate any dispute which he has not agreed to arbitrate.Â  Id. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118.\r\nThe resolution of this case is controlled by our recent pronouncement in Aiken v. World Finance Corporation of South Carolina, Op. No. 26313 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 23, 2007).Â  In that case, we refused to interpret an arbitration agreement with similar, though not identical, language to apply to illegal or outrageous acts that no reasonable person would have foreseen at the time the parties executed the agreement to arbitrate. Â We instructed: \r\n\r\n\tBecause even the most broadly-worded arbitration agreements still have limits founded in general principles of contract law, this Court will refuse to interpret any arbitration agreement as applying to outrageous torts that are unforeseeable to a reasonable consumer in the context of normal business dealings.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nFrom the beginning of her relationship with Global-Sun, Chassereau certainly knew that she would be required to make payments on the pool she purchased.Â  Â Furthermore, Chassereau must have expected that Global-Sun employees would contact her and request that she make payments on the pool if she ceased doing so.Â  However, we believe a reasonable person would not have foreseen and would not have expected (and ought not to expect) Global-Sun employees to commit acts historically associated with the common law tort of outrage in seeking to collect an overdue debt. Our opinion in Aiken unequivocally provides that although these types of uncivilized acts often arise in the course of performance of contracts containing arbitration clauses, South Carolina courts will not interpret arbitration clauses to apply to such acts which are outrageous and unforeseen.Â  \r\nAlthough we are constrained to resolve all doubts in favor of arbitration, this is not an absolute truism intended to replace careful judicial analysis.Â  While actions taken in an arrangement such as the one entered into by these parties might have the potential to generate several legal claims and causes of action, we have no doubt that Chassereau did not intend to agree to arbitrate the claims she asserts in the instant case.Â  Accordingly, we hold that these claims are not covered by the arbitration agreement at issue in the instant case. [2]\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  The majority does not explicitly find that the claims alleged by Mrs. Chassereau do not arise in any matter relating to her agreements with Global-Sun, yet nonetheless holds that the arbitration clause contained in the Installation Agreement does not require Mrs. Chassereauâ€™s claims to be arbitrated.Â  \r\nWe must decide whether Mrs. Chassereauâ€™s claims arise in any manner or are related to her agreement with Global-Sun.[3]Â  Because I would hold that these claims qualify on both counts, I would reverse the decision of the court of appeals.\r\nIn examining whether an arbitration agreement extends to a particular tort claim, South Carolina courts must focus on the factual allegations supporting the claim to determine whether the allegations implicate the contractual agreement, regardless of the legal label assigned to the claim.Â  See Am. Recovery Corp. v. Computerized Thermal Imaging, Inc., 96 F.3d 88, 93 (4th Cir. 1996); Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 597, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â  We have held that a tort claim that does not arise under the governing contract is nevertheless required to be arbitrated if there is a â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ between the tort claim and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained.Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119.Â  Nothing relates more significantly to a contract than efforts to collect amounts due thereunder.\r\nCase law from other jurisdictions supports this conclusion.Â  In Green Tree Fin. Corp.Â  v. Shoemaker, 775 So.2d 149 (Ala. 2000), the purchasers of a mobile home sued the company which financed the purchase.Â  The purchasers claimed that after they became delinquent in their payments, the finance company began a systematic course of harassing them and invading their privacy.Â  Id. at 150.Â  Although the arbitration clause in Shoemaker was broader than the clause at issue in the instant case, the Alabama Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\n\tThe plain language of this provision requires the plaintiffs to submit to arbitration all controversies that arise from, or relate to, the contract. That language clearly encompasses the plaintiffsâ€™ claim alleging invasion of privacy, a claim that arose out of the underlying business transaction of collecting delinquent monthly payments. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 151.[4]\r\nThe case of In re Conseco Fin. Servicing Corp., 19 S.W.3d 562 (Tx. Ct. App. 2000), also arose out of a financed purchase of a mobile home.Â  Interpreting whether an arbitration clause identical to the clause at issue in Shoemaker applied to virtually identical claims, the court held: \r\n\r\n\t[The complaint] arises from Consecoâ€™s alleged efforts to collect the amounts due under the terms of the agreement. Absent the contract, there would be no relationship between [the parties], and there would have been no debt collection . . . . Therefore, we conclude that [the plaintiffâ€™s] claims based on Consecoâ€™s acts in collecting the debt owed on the contract arise from or relate to the contract and so are within the scope of the arbitration clause.\r\n\r\nId. at 570.\r\nI believe the reasoning of both Shoemaker and Conseco applies with equal force in the instant case.Â  In my view, it is difficult to imagine something more related to a debt agreement than actions taken to collect the debt.Â  Under any conceivable definition of the word â€œsignificant,â€ actions taken in seeking to collect a debt must be significantly related to the debt.\r\nThe rule the majority announces is troubling in several regards.Â  Primarily, the rule is inconsistent with the notion that all doubts regarding the question of arbitration are to be construed in favor of arbitration.Â  See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118. Â Similarly, the rule runs afoul of the oft repeated notion that unless a court can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to any interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should generally be ordered.Â  See id.Â  Admittedly, these arbitration principles run counter to general notions of contract interpretation; namely, that a court will construe any doubts and ambiguities in an agreement against the drafter of the agreement.Â  See Myrtle Beach Lumber Co., Inc. v. Willoughby, 276 S.C. 3, 8, 274 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1981) (citing 17A C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 324).Â  In contrast to the majorityâ€™s rule, however, the principle that doubts are construed in favor of arbitration is rooted in a statutory proscription.Â  See Moses H. Cone Memâ€™l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983) (stating that Â§ 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§ 1, et seq., is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary).\r\nMrs. Chassereauâ€™s claims unquestionably arise out of and are significantly related to the Installation Agreement.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties refer to these documents as the â€œInstallation Agreementâ€ and the â€œRetail Installment Agreement.â€Â  For the sake of convenience, we will refer to the latter document as the â€œFinancing Agreement.â€\r\n[2] On appeal, Global-Sun and Darwin also contend that the court of appeals erred in holding that any argument regarding the arbitration clause contained in the Financing Agreement was not preserved for review.Â  In light of the foregoing analysis, however, it is unnecessary for us to address this contention.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing that an appellate court need not address additional issues if the resolution of another issue is dispositive).\r\n[3] This limitation of our inquiry is based on the fact that the arbitration agreement at issue provides that â€œany disputes arising in any manner relating to this agreement . . . shall be subject to mandatory, exclusive and binding arbitration.â€ (emphasis added).\r\n[4] The arbitration clause in Shoemaker purported to apply not only to all claims arising out of or relating to the agreement, but also to all claims between the parties.Â  Id. at 150.Â  This distinction is insignificant, however, because the court in Shoemaker rests its holding only on the relationships of the claims to the agreement.Â  See id. at 151.Â  Thus, Mrs. Chassereauâ€™s attempt to distinguish Shoemaker on this ground is unpersuasive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26319","title":"State v.

Childers, 358 S.C. 614, 595 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 14, 2002, William Larry Childers visited his former live-in girlfriend (the victim) at her motherâ€™s home.[1]Â  According to the victimâ€™s sister, Childers became upset during the meeting because the victim would not leave the house to talk to him. Â Later that night, Childers saw the victim along with her sister and her sisterâ€™s ex-husband at a turkey shoot and a confrontation ensued. Â \r\nAbout 3:00 a.m. on October 15, the victimâ€™s brother returned to his motherâ€™s home and after hearing footsteps in a wooded area near the home, he determined Childers was prowling around the area.Â  The brother immediately called 911, but the police were unable to locate Childers when they arrived.Â  The brother testified he was awakened approximately thirty minutes later by the sound of gunshots in the front yard and when he went outside, he saw â€œChilders go across the yard.â€\r\nAccording to the victimâ€™s sister, she along with her ex-husband and the victim were standing in the victimâ€™s motherâ€™s yard talking after the turkey shoot when Childers suddenly appeared in the yard and shot the victim twice, at close range, in the head.Â  The victimâ€™s sister said she immediately ran toward the house and Childers fired two more shots at her.Â  The victimâ€™s former brother-in-law testified he attempted to warn the victim and his ex-wife that Childers was approaching them, but Childers shot the victim in the back of the head before he could do so.Â  Â \r\nAccording to Childers, he went to a friendâ€™s home, which was close to the victimâ€™s motherâ€™s home, after the turkey shoot.Â  Childers testified he then decided to walk to the victimâ€™s motherâ€™s home to talk to the victim.Â  He testified he carried a loaded gun with him to protect himself from stray dogs during the walk, and as he approached the group standing in the yard, he had the gun in his coat pocket.Â  Childers stated the victimâ€™s former brother-in-law shot at him first.Â  He returned fire, and in doing so, he shot the victim.Â  Childers also testified he did not visit the victim that night with the intention of shooting anyone, but he fired because he was fired upon.\r\nAfter the jury had been selected, Childers requested the trial judge relieve his defense counsel, but the trial court denied this request.Â  At the end of trial, defense counsel requested a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter.Â  The trial judge refused to charge voluntary manslaughter, but charged murder, involuntary manslaughter, and self-defense.Â  Childers was convicted of murder, assault of a high and aggravated nature,[2] and discharging a firearm into a dwelling.Â  He received a life sentence for murder and concurrent terms of ten yearsâ€™ imprisonment for each of the remaining two convictions.Â  \r\nChilders appealed his convictions.Â  The Court of Appeals upheld the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to relieve defense counsel.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded Childersâ€™ murder conviction after finding the trial judge erred in failing to give a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter.Â  Childers, 358 S.C. at 614-21, 595 S.E.2d at 872-76.Â Â Â  \r\nCHILDERSâ€™ ISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the Court of Appeals err in finding the trial judge did not abuse hisdiscretion by denying Childersâ€™ request to relieve defense counsel?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nChilders argues his defense counsel should have been relieved because defense counsel, while employed as an assistant solicitor, had previously prosecuted him on an unrelated charge.[3]Â  We disagree.\r\nA motion to relieve counsel is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Gregory, 364 S.C. 150, 152, 612 S.E.2d 449, 450 (2005); State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 385, 548 S.E.2d 210, 211 (2001).Â  The movant bears the burden to show satisfactory cause for removal.Â  Gregory, 364 S.C. at 152, 612 S.E.2d at 450; Graddick, 345 S.C. at 386, 548 S.E.2d at 211.Â  \r\nChilders asked the trial judge to relieve defense counsel based on defense counselâ€™s prior prosecution of him and his perceived lack of defense counselâ€™s trial preparation.Â  Defense counsel told the trial judge he was ready and prepared to go to trial and he had no independent recollection of prosecuting Childers.Â  Childers failed to show his counsel had any divided loyalties or an actual conflict of interest.Â  See Gregory, 364 S.C. at 152, 612 S.E.2d at 450 (â€œAn actual conflict of interest occurs where an attorney owes a duty to a party whose interests are adverse to the defendantâ€™s.â€); see also People v. Abar, 736 N.Y.S.2d 155 (N.Y. App. Div. 2002) (finding there was no conflict of interest where defendantâ€™s public defender had previously prosecuted him on unrelated charges when she was employed as an assistant district attorney); State v. Cobbs, 584 N.W.2d 709 (Wis. Ct. App. 1998) (concluding there was no actual or serious potential conflict where defendantâ€™s counsel had previously prosecuted defendant while working in the district attorneyâ€™s office).Â  The Court of Appeals correctly found the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Childersâ€™ request to relieve counsel.Â  Â \r\nTHE STATEâ€™S ISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the Court of Appeals err in finding the trial judge improperly denied Childersâ€™ request for a voluntary manslaughter charge?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues Childers was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge given the facts of this case.Â  We agree.\r\nVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in the sudden heat of passion upon a sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 285-86, 350 S.E.2d 180, 184 (1986).Â  â€œThe sudden heat of passion, upon sufficient legal provocation, which mitigates a felonious killing to manslaughter, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out knowledge and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.â€Â  State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 322, 474 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1996) (internal quotations omitted).Â  Both heat of passion and sufficient legal provocation must be present at the time of the killing to constitute voluntary manslaughter.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 451, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000).Â  \r\nThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511, 512 (2000).Â  In determining whether the evidence requires a charge on voluntary manslaughter, this Court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant.Â  Id. at 101, 525 S.E.2d at 512-13.Â  To warrant a courtâ€™s eliminating the offense of manslaughter, it should very clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.Â  Id.\r\nThe Court of Appeals determined the evidence showed that Childers only fired his gun after being fired upon by the victimâ€™s former brother-in-law.Â  The Court of Appeals found, although the victim did not provoke Childers, the provocation by her ex-brother-in-law could be transferred to the victim under the doctrine of transferred intent.Â  Based on this analysis, the Court of Appeals concluded Childers was entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  Childers, 358 S.C. at 621, 595 S.E.2d at 876.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Childers, this factual scenario is completely void of any evidence supporting a charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Childers testified he was provoked by the victimâ€™s former brother-in-law and he fired his gun in response to being first shot at by the ex-brother-in-law.Â  Childersâ€™ testimony does not support the contention that the killing was in the sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation by the victim because, contrary to the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision, the overt act that produces the sudden heat of passion must be made by the victim.Â  See State v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 399, 434 S.E.2d 272, 274 (1993) (â€œ[W]hen death is caused by the use of a deadly weapon, the opprobrious words must be accompanied by the appearance of an assault-by some overt, threatening act-which could have produced the heat of passion.â€); State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 363, 535 S.E.2d 420, 425 (the defendant was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge because the â€œovert act was made by a third party, not the deceased, and South Carolina has not recognized sufficient legal provocation from a third party that can be transferred to the victim.â€); State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 171, 478 S.E.2d 260, 269 (1996) (â€œThe provocation must come from some act of or related to the victim in order to constitute sufficient legal provocation.â€). Â Because there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter, the Court of Appeals erred in finding the trial judge erroneously failed to give a voluntary manslaughter charge.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we uphold Childersâ€™ convictions.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nWALLER, J., concurs.Â  TOAL, C.J., concurring in result only in a separate opinion.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which MOORE, J., concurs.\r\nChief Justice Toal: I concur in the result reached by the majority, but I write separately because I would resolve the case on different grounds.Â  Like the majority, I believe the court of appeals incorrectly determined that the evidence presented at trial entitled the defendant to a voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  In my view, however, the concept of transferred intent has little relevance to the outcome of the instant case.\r\nAs this Courtâ€™s precedent provides, voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in a sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Walker, 324 S.C. 257, 260, 478 S.E.2d 280, 281 (1996).Â  Voluntary manslaughter mitigates an otherwise felonious killing to manslaughter, and while the elements of passion and provocation need not be of such a degree so as to dethrone reason entirely, or shut out knowledge and volition, they must â€œbe such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.â€Â  Id. (citing State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 474 S.E.2d 430 (1996)).Â  When determining whether a defendant is entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge, the court must view the facts in the defendantâ€™s favor.Â  Byrd, 323 S.C. at 321, 474 S.E.2d at 431.\r\nThe defendantâ€™s own narrative is instructive.Â  According to the defendant, the events leading up to the fatal shooting began with a minor altercation early in the evening between the defendant, his live-in girlfriend (from whom he was separated seven days earlier), and his girlfriendâ€™s ex-brother-in-law.Â  The defendant testified that he left the scene of the altercation, visited several other destinations, and eventually decided to attempt to reconcile with his girlfriend at her motherâ€™s house at approximately 3:30 in the morning.Â  The defendant believed it prudent to leave his car nearly two miles away from the house and approach the house from the rear, and as he approached the house, the defendant testified that he observed his girlfriend, his girlfriendâ€™s sister, and the sisterâ€™s ex-husband outside the home.Â  The defendant alleges that as he approached the trio, the sisterâ€™s ex-husband fired a weapon at him.Â  According to the defendant, he used his own gun to return fire, and then retreated from the property while firing multiple times over his shoulder.\r\nThis factual scenario is completely void of any evidence remotely supporting a charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Voluntary manslaughter, by definition, requires a criminal intent to do harm to another.Â  But according to the defendantâ€™s story, he had no criminal intent whatsoever.\r\nIf, as he suggests, the defendant returned fire in a panic for his life, surely the defense of self-defense would be appropriate.Â  Notably, this was charged by the trial court.Â  Similarly, the trial court charged the jury on the law of involuntary manslaughter; perhaps because it was possible for the jury to believe that the defendantâ€™s initial returning of fire was justified, but ultimately find that the defendant was criminally reckless in firing multiple times over his shoulder as he retreated.Â  Without any evidence supporting the view that the defendant fired the fatal shots while under an â€œuncontrollable impulse to do violence,â€ the trial court properly declined to charge the law of voluntary manslaughter to the jury.[4]\r\nIn support of their holding that the defendant was entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge, the court of appeals relied on this Courtâ€™s holding in State v. Penland, 275 S.C. 537, 540, 273 S.E.2d 765, 766 (1981).Â  As the court of appeals noted, that case arguably stands for the proposition that a jury issue on the voluntary manslaughter element of heat of passion can be created in a case similar to the instant case.Â  \r\nÂ Penland cannot be so broad.Â  Read literally, the opinion seems to impermissibly blend the concept of voluntary manslaughter with the defense of self-defense.Â  The opinion provides no substantial factual background for the case, and no description of the events leading up to the apparently fatal incident.Â  To the extent Penland stands for the proposition that a person who simply defends himself while in fear for his life is entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge, the case should be overruled.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision and reinstate the defendantâ€™s murder conviction.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Childersâ€™ motion to relieve his trial counsel, and therefore join that part of the majorityâ€™s opinion.Â  I respectfully dissent, however, from that part of the decision which reverses the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that the trial judge committed reversible error in denying Childersâ€™ request for a voluntary manslaughter charge.\r\nThe majority reverses the voluntary manslaughter holding, finding the Court of Appeals misapplied the doctrine of transferred intent.Â  Aside from the fact that this issue is not before the Court,[5] as explained below, this case represents a classic claim of transferred intent.\r\nâ€œCriminal liability is normally based upon the concurrence of two factors, â€˜an evil meaning mind [and an] evil doing hand.â€™â€Â  United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 402 (1980).Â  Thus, in a homicide case, the law is concerned with the killerâ€™s state of mind, not with the identity of the victim.Â  State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 531 S.E.2d 512 (2000).Â  As the Fennell court explained, â€œ[A] defendant may be found guilty of murder or manslaughter in a case of bad or mistaken aim under the doctrine of transferred intent.Â  In the classic case, the defendant intends to kill or seriously injure one person, but misses that person and mistakenly kills another.â€Â  Id. at 272, 531 S.E.2d at 515.Â  \r\nThus, the critical question was Childersâ€™ mental state at the time he shot.Â  If there is evidence that he fired in the sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation, it matters not that his aim was poor.Â  State v. Fennell, supra. Here, Childers testified that his sudden heat of passion was aroused when the victimâ€™s former brother-in-law shot at him, and that in returning the fire, he mistakenly shot the victim.Â Â  The majority misapplies the doctrine in order to find no voluntary manslaughter charge was warranted. Â See also e.g. State v. Gandy, 283 S.C. 571, 324 S.E.2d 65 (1984) overruled on other grounds Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 (1991); State v. McElveen, 280 S.C. 325, 313 S.E.2d 298 (1984). [6]Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe sole issue before the Court on the Stateâ€™s certiorari is \r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhether the Court of Appeals erred by finding the trial judge incorrectly denied Childersâ€™ request for a voluntary manslaughter charge when the record shows there is no evidence of heat of passion?[7]\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Stateâ€™s argument rests on its contention that Childers did not present evidence that he was â€œinflamed by passionâ€ when he returned the brother-in-lawâ€™s fire.Â  I disagree, and would hold that the jury could have found the â€œheat of passionâ€ in Childersâ€™ testimony that he fired back because he was scared and feared he would be shot at again.\r\nFor these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nMOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; For a more complete recitation of the facts, see State v. Childers, 358 S.C. 614, 595 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n[2]&nbsp; The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion incorrectly referred to this conviction as assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Childers, 358 S.C. at 615, 618, 621, 595 S.E.2d at 873-74, 876.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Childers also argues the trial judge erred in denying his request to relieve counsel because counsel had previously represented the victimâ€™s brother.Â  This issue is not preserved for review because it was not raised at trial.Â  See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 216, 499 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1998) (to be preserved for appeal, an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge).\r\n[4]&nbsp; Tellingly, the fatal shots consisted of two gunshot wounds to the victimâ€™s head.Â  At trial, the Stateâ€™s medical expert testified that powder marks around both wounds suggested that the shots were administered at a close range.Â  Though the implications of this evidence contradict the defendantâ€™s account of the events, we must believe the defendant when determining jury charges.\r\n[5] The State did not challenge the Court of Appeals transferred intent holding on rehearing and consequently could not, and did not, seek certiorari to review that ruling.Â  An unchallenged ruling by the Court of Appeals, even if erroneous, is the law of the case on certiorari.Â  E.g., State v. Barroso, 328 S.C. 268, 493 S.E.2d 854 (1997).\r\n[6]&nbsp; The majority relies on a case where the legal provocation of â€œAâ€ was used by the defendant to justify his intentional shooting of â€œB,â€ State v.

Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the circuit court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 385, 365 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  â€œ[I]n considering cross motions, the court should draw all inferences against each movant in turn.â€Â  73 Am. Jur. 2d Summary Judgment Â§ 43 (2001).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Statute of Limitations\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for partial summary judgment as to Appellantâ€™s statute of limitations defense.Â  We agree.\r\nThe circuit court determined the alleged breach, if any, did not occur until March 2003 when Appellant refused to deliver the remaining records within its possession to Respondent.Â  The circuit court held, in the alternative, Appellantâ€™s letter dated January 28, 2003, acted as a waiver to any statute of limitations defense prior to March 2003.Â  The circuit court also found the discovery rule did not apply, but even if it did, Appellant would be estopped from claiming the statute of limitations as a defense because of its numerous attempts to comply with Respondentâ€™s requests.\r\nA.Â  Date of Breach\r\nBoth parties agree the applicable statute of limitations in this action is set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1) (2005).Â  An action for breach of contract must be brought within three years from the date it accrues.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1).Â  Under the discovery rule, a breach of contract action accrues on the date the injured party either discovered the breach or should have discovered the breach through the exercise of reasonable diligence.Â  State v. McClinton, 369 S.C. 167, 173, 631 S.E.2d 895, 898 (2006) (breach of contract action generally accrues at the time the contract is breached); Santee Portland Cement Co. v. Daniel Intâ€™l Corp., 299 S.C. 269, 271, 384 S.E.2d 693, 694 (1989) (discovery rule applies in contract actions), overruled on other grounds by Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995); see also Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 377, 500 S.E.2d 204, 207 (Ct. App. 1998) (applying the discovery rule to a breach of contract action).\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellant, on March 24, 2000 and on June 23, 2000, Appellant advised Respondent that it would not produce all of Respondentâ€™s documents because some of the documents were commingled with Appellantâ€™s documents and disaggregating them would be too costly and time consuming.Â  On August 21, 2000, Respondent issued a â€œfinal demandâ€ to Appellant.Â  On September 14, 2000, Appellant notified Respondent that it did not consider the Administrative Agreement to be a binding contract, but Appellant would continue to supply specific documents if Respondent needed them to respond to a third-partyâ€™s request for information.Â  On February 22, 2002, Appellant notified Respondent that the latest document review should conclude the ongoing matter and Appellant would supply additional documents only upon Respondentâ€™s specific request.Â  In response to a letter written by Respondent on January 17, 2003, Appellant agreed on January 28, 2003, to look for the missing documents and Appellant advised Respondent to take whatever action it deemed necessary if Respondent was not satisfied by March 31, 2003.Â  In light of this series of events and Appellantâ€™s repeated unwillingness to disaggregate the commingled documents and provide Respondent with a copy of them, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to when Respondent discovered or should have discovered the breach, if any, through the exercise of reasonable diligence.\r\nB.Â  Waiver\r\nA party can waive a statute of limitations defense.Â  McLendon v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 313 S.C. 525, 525-26, 443 S.E.2d 539, 540 (1994).Â  â€œâ€˜Waiver of [the statute of] limitations may be shown by words or conduct.Â  Thus, waiver may result from express agreement, . . . from failure to claim the defense, or by any action or inaction manifestly inconsistent with an intention to insist on the statute.â€™â€Â  Mende v. Conway Hosp., Inc., 304 S.C. 313, 315, 404 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1991) (citing 54 C.J.S. Limitation of Actions Â§ 22 (1987)).Â  Waiver is a question of fact for the finder of fact.Â  Parker v. Parker, 313 S.C. 482, 487, 443 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1994). Â \r\nRespondent specifically argues Appellantâ€™s email dated February 22, 2002, is evidence of Appellantâ€™s waiver of the statute of limitations.Â  On February 22, Appellant notified Respondent it would ship â€œfour boxes of records which represent our final installment of documents.â€Â  However, Appellant also advised that certain invoices were commingled with its documents and Appellant refused to send those documents to Respondent, except by Respondentâ€™s request for specific documents.Â  Viewing this in the light most favorable to Appellant, this email does not indicate Appellant waived the statute of limitations as a matter of law, but rather indicates there is a factual question regarding waiver.\r\nMoreover, the issue is whether Appellantâ€™s willingness to continue to locate documents was an action manifestly inconsistent with an intention to insist upon the statute of limitations.Â  Even though Appellant provided Respondent with a steady flow of documents, Appellant continually notified Respondent that it would not provide all of Respondentâ€™s documents and it would produce the commingled documents on an as needed basis only.Â  Appellant complied with Respondentâ€™s request on a conditional basis until March 2003, and, this conditional response creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Appellant waived the statute of limitations.\r\nC.Â  Estoppel\r\nâ€œ[A] defendant may be estopped from claiming the statute of limitations as a defense if the delay that otherwise would give operation to the statute had been induced by the defendantâ€™s conduct.â€Â  Black v. Lexington Sch. Dist. No. 2, 327 S.C. 55, 61, 488 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1997) (quotations omitted).Â  The inducement may consist of an express representation that the claim will be settled without litigation or conduct that suggests a lawsuit is not necessary.Â  Id.Â  Although the issue of whether a defendant is estopped from claiming the statute of limitations is ordinarily a question of fact to be determined by the judge, summary judgment is appropriate where there is no evidence of conduct on the defendantâ€™s part warranting estoppel.Â  Id. at 61, 62 n.1, 488 S.E.2d at 330, 331 n.1.\r\nEven though Appellant cooperated with Respondentâ€™s requests for documents for several years, Appellant also repeatedly objected to disaggregating the commingled documents due to the unreasonable time and cost involved in the task and advised Respondent that it would produce the commingled documents only upon Respondentâ€™s request for specific documents.Â  Due to this conditional cooperation by Appellant, a factual question exists regarding whether Appellant induced the delay it now asserts as a defense to Respondentâ€™s claim. \r\nII.Â  Laches\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in dismissing its laches defense.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his rights, does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or otherwise detrimentally change his position, then equity will ordinarily refuse to enforce those rights.Â  Chambers of South Carolina, Inc. v. County Council for Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1993).Â  Laches connotes not only an undue lapse of time, but also negligence and opportunity to have acted sooner.Â  Id. at 421, 434 at 281.Â  The party seeking to establish laches must show (1) delay, (2) unreasonable delay, and (3) prejudice.Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 199, 371 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1988).\r\nThe circuit court denied summary judgment as to whether a contract existed and if so, whether the contract had been breached.Â  Because the date of the breach, if any, is unknown, there are factual questions as to whether there was a delay, whether the delay was unreasonable, and whether the delay, if any, prejudiced Appellant.Â  Even if laches is implicated in this case, summary judgment was improperly granted on Appellantâ€™s laches defense given these factual questions. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s grant of partial summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  We need not address Appellantâ€™s remaining issue.Â  See Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711 (2005) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â RWE NUKEM GmbH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of RWE AG, a publicly-traded German corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26321","title":"Elephant, Inc. v.

Hancock, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  This is an appeal from an order of the circuit court, which affirmed the ruling of the Administrative Law Court (ALC), and held that Elephant, Inc., violated S.C. Code Ann. Reg. Â§ 7-200.4, in transferring alcohol to an under-aged confidential informant (CI).[1]Â  Elephant appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nElephant owns Platinum Plus, a bar in Greenville, SC.Â  On January 21, 2005, South Carolina Law Enforcement (SLED) agents sent an undercover, nineteen-year old confidential informant (CI) into Platinum Plus.Â  Employees of the bar checked the CIâ€™s driverâ€™s license at the door and noted that he was under twenty-one years of age.Â  They confiscated the CIâ€™s driverâ€™s license, put wristbands on his wrists, and stamped large Xâ€™s on the back of his hands. The CI then walked to the bar, ordered, paid for, and was served a Coorâ€™s Light beer.Â  Upon observing this, a Platinum Plus employee immediately walked over to the CI and attempted to confiscate the beer.Â  However, the employee was stopped by SLED agents, and the bartender was arrested for serving alcohol to the minor CI.Â  An administrative citation was issued to Elephant, Inc. for violation of Reg. 7-200.4.Â  \r\nThe bartender was subsequently charged with transferring beer to a minor under the age of twenty-one and was found not guilty.Â  Elephant, Inc. was issued a $1000.00 fine by the Department of Revenue.Â  On appeal, the ALC reduced the fine to $100.00, finding the fine excessive in light of Elephantâ€™s corporate policy attempting to prevent the sale or possession of alcohol by minors.Â  Elephant appeals, contending it is not subject to â€œprosecutionâ€ because the minor CI was never prosecuted for under-age possession.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-10 et seq. sets forth general provisions governing beer, ale, porter and wine.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-50:\r\n\r\n  It is unlawful for a person to sell beer to a person under twenty one years of age.Â  A person who makes a sale in violation of this section must, upon conviction, be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred dollars or imprisoned not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days, or both, in the discretion of the court.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-90:\r\n\r\n  It is unlawful for a person to transfer or give to a person under the age of twenty one years for the purpose of consumption beer or wine at any place in the State. A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than two hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-100 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  If a person is charged with a violation of Section 61-4-50 (the unlawful sale of beer or wine to minors), the minor must also be charged with a violation of Section 20-7-8920 (unlawful purchase or possession of beer or wine). . . . \r\n  Unless the provisions of this section are complied with, no person charged with a violation of Section 61-4-50 may be convicted of the offense.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).Â  \r\nElephant argues that because the under-aged CI was not prosecuted, it cannot be prosecuted either criminally or administratively.Â  We disagree.Â  Section 61-4-100 requires only that if a person is charged with a violation of Â§ 61-4-50 (the unlawful sale of beer or wine to minors), the minor must also be charged with a violation of Section 20-7-8920 (unlawful purchase or possession of beer or wine).Â  Noticeably, Â§ 61-4-100 does not require that when a person is charged with the transfer of beer or wine to a minor (under Â§ 61-4-90), that the minor must also be charged with charged with a violation.Â  There is a legitimate basis for the distinction between the two offenses.Â  The sale of beer to minors in violation of Â§ 61-4-50 is punishable by up to sixty days imprisonment, thereby making it a general sessions offense, whereas a violation of Â§ 61-4-90 carries a maximum thirty day sentence, so as to be a magistrateâ€™s court offense.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-330 (Magistrates have jurisdiction over offenses with fines up to five hundred dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding thirty days, or both).Â Â Â  \r\nFurther, Elephant was not prosecuted under the above statues but was administratively sanctioned pursuant to S.C. Code Reg. 7-200.4,[2] which provides:\r\n\r\n  To permit or knowingly allow a person under twenty-one year of age to purchase or possess or consume alcoholic liquors, beer or wine in or on a licensed place of business which holds a license or permit issued by the Department is prohibited and constitutes a violation against the license or permit. Such violation shall be sufficient cause to suspend or revoke the license or permit by the Department.\r\n  Â  For a violation of any regulation pertaining to beer or wine, the department may impose a monetary penalty of up to one-thousand dollars upon the holder of a beer or wine license in lieu of suspension or revocation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-250.\r\n\r\nElephantâ€™s contention is meritless.Â  Although it is correct that it may not be prosecuted for the sale of alcohol under Â§ 61-4-50 unless the minor is also prosecuted, it cites no authority for the proposition that it may not be administratively sanctioned for violation of a regulation.Â  Administrative sanctions simply are not equivalent to a criminal prosecution.Â  See e.g., State v. Price, 333 S.C. 267, 510 S.E.2d 215 (1998) (administrative suspension of driverâ€™s license does not constitute a criminal penalty); State v. Blick, 325 S.C. 636, 481 S.E.2d 452 (Ct. App. 1997) (adoption and execution of policies and practices necessary to preserve internal order and discipline, and to maintain institutional security in the prison are within the province and expertise of correctional officials and do not bar subsequent criminal prosecution).Â  We find it is within the Department of Revenueâ€™s authority to impose an administrative sanction for the unlawful transfer of alcohol to a minor, without the necessity of the minor being prosecuted.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C. Code Reg. 7-200.4, concerning the possession of alcoholic beverages by minors under 21 years old, makes the following a violation of the ownerâ€™s beverage license:\r\n\r\n  To permit or knowingly allow a person under twenty-one year of age to purchase or possess or consume alcoholic liquors, beer or wine in or on a licensed place of business which holds a license or permit issued by the Department is prohibited and constitutes a violation against the license or permit. Such violation shall be sufficient cause to suspend or revoke the license or permit by the Department. \r\n\r\n[2] Â Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-2-60, the South Carolina Department of Revenue has the authority to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the duties imposed upon them by law for the proper administration and enforcement of laws pertaining to the distribution of alcohol.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26322","title":"Henderson v.

(Respondents).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellants, North Carolina residents, filed a complaint in 1997 arising out of Mr. Hendersonâ€™s exposure to asbestos containing products while working as a boilermaker, pipefitter, and sheet metal worker for many years at various industrial sites in South Carolina.Â  Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s claims arose out of her loss of consortium and enjoyment of life.Â  According to the complaint, Respondents â€œmined, manufactured, processed, imported, converted, compounded and/or retailed substantial amounts of asbestos and asbestos-related materialsâ€ and caused such materials to be placed in the stream of interstate commerce with the result that the materials were sold, distributed and used in South Carolina.Â  Appellants alleged Mr. Henderson â€œused, worked with, was in the vicinity of, and was exposed to asbestos and asbestos containing productsâ€ during the course of his employment and, as a result, contracted mesothelioma and other asbestos-related illnesses.Â  Mr. Henderson was diagnosed in North Carolina.Â  \r\nIn a 2001 order, the trial court excluded certain affidavits presented by Appellants for their failure to comply with Rule 33, SCRCP, and dismissed the following defendants from the case pursuant to the Door Closing Statute, S.C.

Â§ 15-5-150 (2005), and Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP: AC&amp;S, Certain-Teed Corporation, Carlisle Corporation, Qualco Products, North American Refractories, Uniroyal, Pnuemo Abex, Kelsey-Hayes, Freightliner, Peterbilt (Paccar), Kenworth (Paccar), International Truck and Engine (formerly Navistar), Daimler Chrysler, General Motors, Ford, Combustion Engineering, Aqua-Chem, and Bird[1].Â  The trial court found no evidence to support the allegation that Mr. Henderson was exposed to asbestos containing products in South Carolina.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted defendants Rayloc and Covil summary judgment on product identification grounds, finding no evidence their products contained asbestos.Â  The trial court also denied the motions of Allied Signal and McCord Corporation, finding genuine issues of material fact existed as to Mr. Hendersonâ€™s exposure to their asbestos containing products in South Carolina.Â  The trial court denied Appellantsâ€™ motions for reconsideration.Â Â Â  \r\nThe case went to trial against Allied, McCord, and Dana with McCord and Dana settling during trial.Â  The jury found for Allied, and Appellants appealed.[2]Â  We certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment based on product exposure?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in limiting the scope of Appellantsâ€™ evidence solely to mesothelioma?Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 550 S.E.2d 319 (2001).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Product Exposure\r\nAppellants argue: (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on product exposure to Uniroyal, Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Abex, and Rayloc; and (2) a jury question exists as to exposure in relation to Kenworth, Freightliner, Paccar, and International Truck.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\n  The Door Closing Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-150, provides:\r\n  An action against a corporation created by or under the laws of any other state, government or country may be brought in the circuit court:\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; By any resident of this State for any cause of action; or\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; By a plaintiff not a resident of this State when the cause of action shall have arisen or the subject of the action shall be situated within this State.Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, the Respondents argued Mr. Henderson had no exposure within South Carolina to their asbestos containing products and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based on the Door Closing Statute and Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  Noting Mr. Henderson was admittedly not a resident of South Carolina, the trial court focused on whether the cause of action arose in South Carolina, relying on Murphy v. Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., 346 S.C. 37, 550 S.E.2d 589 (Ct. App. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Farmer v. Monsanto Corp., 353 S.C. 553, 579 S.E.2d 325 (2003) (â€œBecause Â§ 15-5-150 does not involve subject matter jurisdiction but rather determines the capacity of a party to sue, we overrule these cases to the extent they hold otherwise.â€).Â  \r\nIn Murphy, the Court of Appeals held: â€œIn applying the Door Closing Statute, the manifestation of injury through diagnosis, while relevant, is not dispositive in every case for the purpose of determining whether a cause of action shall have arisen in South Carolina.â€Â  Murphy, 346 S.C. at 48, 550 S.E.2d at 594-95.Â  Finding the exposure to asbestos originated in South Carolina, the Court of Appeals held plaintiffâ€™s claims arose in this State â€œeven though they did not accrue until the mesothelioma was diagnosed.â€Â  Id. at 48, 550 S.E.2d at 594.Â  The Court of Appeals, therefore, found the Door Closing Statute did not bar plaintiffâ€™s claims because there was a sufficient connection to South Carolina when the acts which gave rise to the cause of action occurred in this State.Â  Id. at 48, 550 S.E.2d at 595.Â  Following the trial courtâ€™s order in this case, this Court affirmed Murphy and held: â€œ[T]he proper inquiry is whether the foreign corporationâ€™s activities that allegedly exposed the victim to the injurious substance, and the exposure itself, occurred within the State.Â  If so, then the legal wrong was committed here.â€Â  356 S.C. 592, 598, 590 S.E.2d 479, 482 (2003).Â  \r\nAppellants failed to meet the Murphy test because they failed to show Respondentsâ€™ products contained asbestos, and they failed to show any actionable exposure in South Carolina.Â  In determining whether exposure is actionable, we adopt the â€œfrequency, regularity, and proximity testâ€ set forth in Lohrmann v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp., 782 F.2d 1156, 1162 (4th Cir. 1986): Â â€œTo support a reasonable inference of substantial causation from circumstantial evidence, there must be evidence of exposure to a specific product on a regular basis over some extended period of time in proximity to where the plaintiff actually worked.â€Â  \r\nWe agree with the trial court that â€œpresence in the vicinity of static asbestos is not exposure to asbestos,â€ and find Appellants failed to present evidence of regular and frequent exposure to asbestos containing products in proximity to where Mr. Henderson worked.Â  Due to the lack of evidence Mr. Henderson was exposed to the Respondentsâ€™ asbestos containing products in South Carolina, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s holding.\r\nII.Â  Limited Evidence\r\nAppellants argue the trial court unduly limited their evidence to mesothelioma.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ claim against Allied arises out of Mr. Hendersonâ€™s experience working with brake products manufactured by Allied and his diagnosis of mesothelioma.Â  Appellants argue the trial court erred in excluding certain evidence concerning other asbestos-related diseases and limiting evidence to cases, reports, and studies showing a link between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma.Â  \r\nThe trial court correctly excluded evidence concerning other asebestos-related diseases because such evidence was merely cumulative of evidence actually allowed.Â  See, e.g., Commerce Center of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 559, 556 S.E.2d 718, 726 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œGenerally, there is no abuse of discretion where the excluded testimony is merely cumulative of other evidence proffered to the jury.â€)Â  Appellants were given the opportunity to present evidence concerning asbestos and Mr. Hendersonâ€™s asbestos-related illness.Â  Because the factual issues of the case were fully aired, the exclusion of cumulative reports and studies did not prejudice Appellants.Â  Furthermore, such evidence was arguably irrelevant under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  See, e.g., State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œA trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.Â  We review a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgment.â€)Â  (internal citations omitted).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nApplying both Murphy and Lohrman, we find Appellants failed to prove actionable exposure to Respondentsâ€™ asbestos-containing products.Â  We affirm the decision of the trial court granting summary judgment to Respondents based on the Door Closing statute.Â  We also affirm the decision of the trial court excluding certain affidavits as cumulative.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, and PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] During the course of litigation, numerous defendants filed for bankruptcy and, therefore, are not parties to this action.Â  Also, Pnuemo-Abex reached a settlement agreement with Appellants prior to oral arguments before this Court.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Mr. Henderson died shortly after trial, and Ms. Henderson, as personal representative of his estate, proceeded with this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
