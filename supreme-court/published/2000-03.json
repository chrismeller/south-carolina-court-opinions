Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court \r\nJudge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25077Heard January 4, 2000 - Filed March 6, 2000\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Robert E. Bogan, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for appellant.\r\n        J. Edward Bell, IIII, of Bell &amp; Moore, P.A., of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: The family court denied the State's motion to transfer jurisdiction to the court of general sessions. This appeal is from the order \r\nof the circuit court affirming the family court's decision. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nRespondent was charged with two counts each of murder, criminal sexual conduct in the first degree (CSC), and burglary in the first degree. \r\nHe was twelve years old at the time the crimes were \r\ncommitted.\r\nThe State petitioned the family court to transfer jurisdiction to the court of general sessions, and a waiver hearing was held. The family \r\ncourt denied the State's motion to transfer jurisdiction of respondent's case. \r\nThe State appealed to the circuit court which affirmed the family court's \r\norder.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Does the transfer of jurisdiction statute allow a juvenile under the age of fourteen charged with murder to be waived to general sessions court?\r\n  2. Did the family court abuse its discretion in not transferring jurisdiction over the murder charges to general sessions \r\n    court?\r\n  3. If respondent is waived to general sessions court based on the murder charges, must the remaining charges be retained in family court?\r\n\r\n1. TRANSFER OF JUVENILE UNDER AGE \r\nFOURTEEN\r\n\r\nThe circuit court found that the transfer statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-7-7605 (Supp. 1998), did not authorize the family court to waive a \r\ntwelve year-old to general sessions court.1 The State \r\nargues that the circuit court erred. We agree.\r\nThe circuit court found that the transfer statute did not allow respondent to be waived because he was under fourteen years of age. \r\nThe circuit court focused on whether a twelve-year-old could be waived up to \r\ngeneral sessions court if charged with a Class A, B, C, or D felony. Looking \r\nprimarily to subsection five of the transfer statute, the circuit court determined that \r\nthe family court had the discretion to waive up a defendant as young as \r\nfourteen.2 The circuit court concluded that the statute did not give this discretion to \r\nthe family court when a child under the age of fourteen is \r\ninvolved.\r\nThe State argues that the circuit court failed to address subsection six of the transfer statute which specifically deals with when a child has \r\nbeen charged with murder. Moreover, the State contends that because this subsection contains no explicit age limitation for waiver, the circuit court \r\nerred in finding that the statute prohibits the family court from transferring jurisdiction over the murder charges. We agree.\r\nIn interpreting a statute, this Court's primary function is to ascertain the intent of the legislature. E.g., Whitner v. State, 328 \r\nS.C. 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1145,118 S.Ct. \r\n1857,140 L.Ed.2d 1104 (1998). Moreover, \"there is a basic presumption that the legislature \r\nhas knowledge of previous, legislation as well as of judicial decisions \r\nconstruing that legislation when later statutes are enacted concerning related subjects.\" \r\nId.\r\nSubsection six of section 20-7-7605 provides, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  (6) Within thirty days after the filing of a petition in the family court alleging the child has committed the offense of murder or criminal sexual conduct, the person executing the petition may request in writing that the case be transferred to the court of general sessions with a view to proceeding against the child as a criminal rather than as a child coming within the purview of this article. The judge of the family court is authorized to determine this request ....\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605(6) (Supp. 1998) (emphasis added).3\r\n\r\nSection 20-7-7605 was enacted in 1996. It is substantially similar to its predecessor statute, section 20-7-430, which was enacted in 1981 \r\nand repealed in 1996. Prior to 1981, section 14-21-510 was a statute similar \r\nto subsection six of the transfer statute and section 14-21-540 was the \r\ngeneral transfer statute. These two statutes were repealed in 1981. Section \r\n14-21-510 originally allowed waiver of a juvenile charged with murder, \r\nmanslaughter, rape, attempted rape, arson, common-law burglary, bribery or perjury. \r\nLater, this statute was amended to only list murder and rape. See In the \r\nInterest of Shaw, 274 S.C. 534, 538, 265 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1980) \r\n(citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14 21-510(4) (Supp. 1978)).\r\nIn Shaw, this Court noted that the statute allowing \r\nwaiver in murder and rape cases \"authorizes a transfer of jurisdiction on the basis \r\nof the nature of the offense without regard to the age of the juvenile. On \r\nthe other hand, section 14-21-540 authorizes a transfer of jurisdiction on the basis of \r\nthe age of the juvenile without regard to the nature of the offense, as long as \r\nthe offense would be criminal if committed by an adult.\" \r\nShaw, 274 S.C. at 539, 265 S.E.2d at 524 (emphasis added). The Shaw Court \r\nconcluded that \"these two provisions of law were intended by the General Assembly to cover separate situations.\" Id.\r\nApplying the reasoning of Shaw to the current version \r\nof the transfer statute, section 20-7-7605(6) authorizes transfer on the basis of \r\nthe offense (murder) without regard to age, while other subsections of \r\n20-7-7605 authorize transfer on the basis of age and the classification of the \r\noffense. Because there is no express age designation in section 20-7-7605(6) \r\nwhereas other subsections expressly contain age restrictions, we conclude that \r\nthe Legislature intended these separate subsections \"to cover separate \r\nsituations.\" Shaw, 274 S.C. at 539, 265 S.E.2d at 524.\r\nMoreover, in Sanders v. State, 281 S.C. 53, 314 S.E.2d \r\n319 (1984), this Court held that the family court did not abuse its discretion in \r\ntransferring a case to general sessions court where the appellant, at the age of thirteen, \r\nwas charged with two counts of murder and two counts of assault and battery \r\nwith intent to kill. The State argues that because section 20-7-7605 was enacted \r\nin 1996 - after the Sanders opinion - the Legislature is \r\ncharged with the knowledge of this decision. The State contends that by not acting to change \r\nthe transfer statute to prevent children under fourteen from being waived up \r\nto general sessions court, the Legislature intended that section 20-7-7605(6) \r\napply to all juveniles who commit the offense of murder, even if they are under \r\nthe age of fourteen. We find the State's argument persuasive. See \r\nWhitner, supra (there is a basic presumption that the legislature has knowledge of \r\nprevious legislation as well as of judicial decisions construing that legislation when \r\nlater statutes are enacted):\r\nWe hold that the Legislature intended to give the family court discretion to transfer jurisdiction in a murder case for any juvenile, \r\nregardless of age. The circuit court therefore erred in finding that the transfer \r\nstatute prohibits a juvenile under the age of fourteen from being waived to \r\ngeneral sessions court when charged with murder. Accordingly, the circuit court's ruling on this issue is reversed.\r\n2. DENIAL OF TRANSFER MOTION\r\n\r\nAt the waiver hearing for respondent and three co-defendants, the following pertinent evidence was presented about the victims, the ensuing investigation, and the pre-adjudicatory waiver evaluations of the \r\njuveniles.\r\nThe charges against respondent relate to two separate incidents which occurred within one week. On September 26, 1997, Florence Bradford, a 92-year-old woman, was discovered, nude, on the ground, underneath her residence. The police officer who discovered Bradford testified at the \r\nwaiver hearing that she assumed Bradford had fallen through the floorboards and rolled under the home. The officer testified that Bradford was very blue because the weather had been extremely cold.\r\nBradford died in the hospital two days later. The forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy testified that Bradford had been \r\nbeaten on her head, torso and extremities and that there was recent trauma to \r\nthe genital region. The pathologist concluded that Bradford died from \r\nhypothermia and dehydration due to multiple blunt force injuries and cold exposure. \r\nIn addition, the pathologist believed the genital trauma was consistent with \r\nsexual assault.\r\nOn October 1, 1997, the body of Ruby Currie was discovered in her home. Currie, a 93-year-old woman, was found in her bedroom with her \r\npanties off, her bottom half exposed, and her gown pulled up. Black pepper had apparently been poured on her chest area. The pathologist testified that Currie's death was caused by asphyxiation due to manual strangulation. According to the pathologist, sexual assault and blunt force trauma to the \r\nhead and extremities also contributed to Currie's death.\r\nIn their investigation of the deaths of Bradford and Currie, police interrogated fourteen-year-old Chris O. Chris gave a taped statement \r\nwhich implicated himself, respondent, and another juvenile, Markell J., in the \r\nCurrie murder. Chris also implicated respondent in the Bradford murder. Based on Chris' statement, police apprehended respondent for questioning. He gave \r\na taped statement in which he admitted participating in both the Bradford \r\nand Currie murders. He stated that he, Chris and Markell went to rob these women, and after entering their residences, beat and raped \r\nthem.\r\nAnother boy, Toby C., age 14, gave a taped statement. He implicated respondent, Chris, and fifteen-year-old Carlos J. in the \r\nCurrie murder. Toby stated that he did not enter the residence but acted more as \r\na look-out.\r\nRespondent testified at the waiver hearing. He denied participation in these murders. He stated that he saw Toby, asked Toby what he was \r\ndoing, and that Toby told him to \"look.\" Respondent testified that he looked in through the door, saw two people assaulting Currie, and then turned \r\naround and ran away. Respondent stated that his taped inculpatory statement was coerced by police.\r\nThe waiver hearing involved respondent, Chris, Carlos, and Toby. Dr. Charles Sailor, the forensic psychologist who performed the waiver evaluation of Carlos, testified that although Carlos was fifteen years old, \r\nhe found Carlos' maturity to be more characteristic of a twelve-year-old child \r\nthan fifteen-year-old. With an IQ of 70, Dr. Sailor characterized Carlos as on \r\nthe borderline of mildly mentally retarded. The psychologists who performed \r\nthe waiver evaluations of Chris and Toby, both 14 years old, classified both \r\nthese boys as mildly mentally retarded.\r\nIn contrast, respondent's waiver evaluation by Dr. Elliott Herman revealed that he had average intelligence with an IQ of 91. Dr. Herman \r\nfound respondent's level of sophistication and maturity consistent with his \r\nage. Regarding respondent's likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation, Dr. \r\nHerman found six positive factors and six negative factors. For example, as \r\npositive factors for rehabilitation, Dr. Herman noted respondent's level of \r\nintellectual functioning, his lack of history of severe mental illness or substance of \r\nabuse, his ability to empathize with the victims, and his age. Negative factors \r\nincluded the serious and violent nature of the offenses, respondent's vulnerability \r\nto negative peer pressure, and respondent's pattern of aggressive behavior and \r\nhis tendency to blame others for that behavior.\r\nIn its order denying the State's motion to transfer jurisdiction, the family court made several findings of fact. The family court found \r\nthat:\r\n\r\n  -the crimes respondent had been charged with are horrible and shocking;\r\n  -there was probable cause to believe respondent participated actively in all aspects of the crimes, and this justified concern for the safety of the public if he were to be released to live freely among the public anytime soon;\r\n  -the crimes were violent, aggressive, premeditated and willful;\r\n  -indictment by a grand jury was reasonably certain;\r\n  -it would be easier for the state to proceed against all defendants in the same court, especially in view of the only evidence being statements of some defendants;\r\n  -respondent's intellectual abilities were chronologically appropriate, unlike his co-defendants; and\r\n  -respondent was the brightest of all the co-defendants and was more susceptible to rehabilitation than the other defendants.\r\n\r\nThe family court specifically considered the factors set forth in \r\nKent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 \r\nL.Ed.2d 84 (1966).4 Based on the Kent factors and the factual findings, the family \r\ncourt concluded that there was time for respondent to be rehabilitated by the juvenile justice system \r\nand that, in addition to rehabilitation, protection of the public and \r\nappropriate punishment could be appropriately addressed under the juvenile system. Although the family court waived respondent's three co-defendants to \r\ngeneral sessions court, it denied the State's motion to transfer jurisdiction of respondent's case.\r\nThe circuit court found that the family court, by conducting an extensive waiver hearing and evaluating the Kentfactors, had followed appropriate procedure. The circuit court ruled there was evidence to \r\nsupport the family court's decision to deny the transfer motion and therefore \r\naffirmed.\r\nThe State argues the family court abused its discretion in denying the motion to transfer jurisdiction. We agree.\r\nInitially, we note that there is no challenge to the manner in which the family court conducted the proceedings below. The waiver hearing \r\nindeed was extensive and the family court's order reflects that the evidence \r\npresented at the hearing was duly considered. See State v. \r\nKelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 65, 502 S.E.2d 63, 70-71(1998) (\"It is the responsibility of the family court to \r\ninclude in its waiver of jurisdiction order a sufficient statement of reasons for, \r\nand considerations leading to, that decision.\"). Moreover, the family court specifically considered the Kent factors, which in \r\nprevious cases this Court has implicitly approved as appropriate criteria. See State v. \r\nAvery, 333 S.C. 284, 289 n.3, 509 S.E.2d 476, 479 n.3 (1998); Kelsey, 331 \r\nS.C. at 65 n.4, 502 S.E.2d at 70 n.4.\r\nRegardless of the procedural aspects of the transfer proceedings, this Court reviews the merits of a transfer order for an abuse of the \r\nfamily court's discretion. Avery, 333 S.C. at 292, 509 S.E.2d at \r\n481; Sanders, 281 S.C. at 56, 314 S.E.2d at 321; State v. Wright, 269 S.C. \r\n414, 419-20, 237 S.E.2d 764, 767 (1977). The term 'abuse of discretion' has no opprobrious implication \r\nand may be found if the conclusions reached by the lower court are without reasonable factual support. Runyon v. Wright, 322 S.C. \r\n15,19, 471 S.E.2d 160, 162 (1996); South Carolina State Highway Dep't v. \r\nShare, 242 S.C. 397, 402, 131 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1963). We note, however, \r\n\r\n  [i]t is not always easy to determine when and if a trial judge has abused his discretion. Overly simplified, abuse of discretion involves the extent of disagreement. When an appellate court is in agreement with a discretionary ruling or is only mildly in disagreement, it says that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion. On the other hand, when the appellate court is in substantial or violent disagreement, it says that there has been an abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nRish v. Rish, 296 S.C. 14, 15-16, 370 S.E.2d 102, 103 \r\n(Ct. App. 1988). \r\nIn evaluating whether the family court abused its discretion, we consider the Kent factors and emphasize that the \r\nserious nature of the offense is a major factor in the transfer decision. Avery, 333 S.C. \r\nat 292, 509 S.E.2d at 481; Kelsey, 331 S.C. at 65, 502 S.E.2d at 71; \r\nSanders, 281 S.C. at 56, 314 S.E.2d at 321. Furthermore,\" [t]he best interests of the public or of the \r\njuvenile may require the juvenile be held accountable as an adult for his criminal conduct.\" Avery, 333 S.C. at 293, 509 S.E.2d at \r\n481.\r\nIn our opinion, the family court's decision to deny the transfer motion is not reasonably supported by its own factual findings. The \r\nfamily court found, and the evidence supports, that these horrible, shocking \r\ncrimes were willfully committed and there was probable cause to believe \r\nrespondent participated actively in all aspects of the crimes. That these crimes \r\nwere violent, premeditated, and committed against elderly women clearly \r\nindicates their serious nature. While murder will always be considered \"serious,\" \r\nthe heinousness of these particular crimes is beyond dispute.\r\nAdditionally, the family court found indictment by a grand jury likely and that it would be easier for the state to proceed against all \r\ndefendants in the same court. Nonetheless, the family court waived respondent's co-defendants to general sessions court while retaining jurisdiction of respondent's case. Though the family court did find that respondent's intellectual abilities were superior to those of his co-defendants and \r\nthat respondent was more susceptible to rehabilitation than his co-defendants, \r\nwe believe that under the circumstances of this case these considerations do \r\nnot overcome the overwhelming amount of evidence which militates in favor of transferring the murder charges to a court of general \r\nsessions.\r\nWe find that, with regard to the murder charges against respondent, the family court abused its discretion in denying the State's \r\nmotion to transfer jurisdiction.\r\n3. JURISDICTION OF THE BURGLARY AND CSC CHARGES\r\n\r\nThe issue remains as to whether the charges of first degree burglary and first degree CSC must be retained in family court or may be transferred \r\nto the court of general sessions along with the murder \r\ncharges.\r\nThe State maintains the transfer statute applies to the transfer of jurisdiction over all related charges. We disagree.\r\nAs discussed above in Issue 1, subsection six of the transfer statute allows the family court discretion to waive a juvenile to general sessions \r\ncourt on charges of murder. Although section 20-7-7605(6) on its face appears \r\nto apply to charges of CSC as well, this Court recently concluded that S.C. \r\nCode Ann. Â§ 16-3-659 (1985)5 prohibits a \r\njuvenile under the age of fourteen from being transferred to general sessions court on a CSC charge. Slocumb \r\nv. State, Op. No. 25013 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 8, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. 34 at \r\n27). Accordingly, the CSC charges may not be transferred to general sessions \r\ncourt.\r\nRegarding the burglary charges, first degree burglary is classified as a felony punishable by life imprisonment or, at a minimum, by a prison \r\nterm of not less than fifteen years. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(Supp. 1998). \r\nThus, subsection five of the transfer statute applies, and that section provides, \r\nin part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  If a child fourteen or fifteen years of age is charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would be a Class A, B, C, or D felony as defined in Section 16-1-20 or a \r\nfelony which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years or more, the [family] court, after full investigation and hearing, may determine it contrary to the best interest of the child or of the public to retain \r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605(5) (Supp. 1998) (emphasis added). Based on the plain language of this subsection; a child who is twelve years old is not \r\nsubject to transfer. As we stated above in Issue 1, this subsection authorizes \r\ntransfer on the basis of age and the classification of the offense. Because \r\nrespondent does not meet the age restriction of section 20-7-7605(5), transfer of \r\nthe burglary charges is simply not authorized by the statute.\r\nThe State argues that because CSC and burglary charges relate to the same incidents as the murder charges, this Court should apply a \"transactional\" analysis, and transfer all the charges to general sessions \r\ncourt.6 Although it may seem illogical that respondent will be treated as a juvenile \r\nin family court for the CSC and burglary charges, while being treated as an \r\nadult in general sessions court for the murder charges, it is beyond this Court's \r\npower to effect a change in the statutes enacted by the Legislature. \r\nKeyserling v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 86, 470 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1996) \r\n(the Court does not sit as a superlegislature to second guess the wisdom or folly of decisions of \r\nthe General Assembly).\r\nTherefore, we hold that jurisdiction over the CSC and burglary charges must be retained in the family court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe reverse the circuit court's ruling that the transfer statute, section 20-7-7605, prevents waiver of a juvenile under the age of fourteen \r\nwhen charged with murder. Finding that the family court abused its discretion by \r\nnot waiving respondent to general sessions court on the murder charges, we \r\nalso reverse the circuit court's ruling which affirmed this aspect of the family \r\ncourt's order. We affirm, however, the denial of transfer on the CSC and burglary charges.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nTOAL,, A.C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Associate Justice George T. Gregory, Jr., concur.\r\n1We note that the family court did not deny the motion to transfer on this ground.\r\n2Subsection five of the transfer statute provides the following:\r\n\r\n  (5) If a child fourteen or fifteen years of age is charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would be a Class A, B, C, or D felony as defined in Section 16-1-20 or a felony which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years or more, the [family] court, after full investigation and hearing, may determine it contrary to the best interest of the child or of the public to retain jurisdiction. The court, acting as committing magistrate, may bind over the child for proper criminal proceedings to a court which would have trial jurisdiction of the offenses if committed by an adult.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-7605 (Supp. 1998). The circuit court also noted that subsections nine and ten of the transfer statute specifically relate to a \"child fourteen years of age or older.\" Id.\r\n3While section 20-7-7605(6) appears to apply to charges of CSC, this Court recently decided that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-659 (1985) prohibits a juvenile under the age of fourteen from being transferred to general sessions court on a CSC charge. Slocumb v. State, Op. No. 25013 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 8,1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. 34 at 27).\r\n4 In Kent, the United States Supreme Court noted the following criteria for determining whether jurisdiction should be waived under the District of Columbia Juvenile Court Act:\r\n\r\n  1. The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and whether the protection of the community requires waiver.\r\n  2. Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful manner.\r\n  3. Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons especially if injury resulted.\r\n  4. The prosecutive merit of the complaint, i.e., whether there is evidence upon which a Grand Jury may be expected to return an indictment ....\r\n  5. The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense in one court when the juvenile's associates in the alleged offense are adults who will be charged with a crime ....\r\n  6. The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined by consideration of his home, environmental situation, emotional attitude and pattern of living.\r\n  7. The record and previous [criminal or adjudicative] history of the juvenile ....\r\n  8. The prospects for adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is found to have committed the alleged offense) by the use of procedures, services and facilities currently available to the Juvenile Court.\r\n\r\nKent, 383 U.S. at 566-67, 86 S.Ct. at 1060,' 16 L.Ed.2d at 100-01.\r\n5 Section 16-3-959 states that the \"common law rule that a boy under fourteen years is conclusively presumed to be incapable of committing the crime of rape shall not be enforced in this State. Provided that any person under the age of 14 shall be tried as a juvenile\" when charged with CSC. (Emphasis added.)\r\n6Cf. State v. Hamilton, 285 S.C. 133, 328 S.E.2d 633 (1985) (where the Court held that the circuit court had jurisdiction over a conspiracy charge against a juvenile defendant even though this charge had not been presented to and transferred by the family court).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25078","title":"Brown v.

His petition for post conviction relief (PCR) \r\nwas granted. We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nCharleston County Sheriffs deputies arrested respondent during a drug raid on an apartment in which respondent was a visitor. At respondent's trial, the State presented four witnesses: three police \r\nofficers who conducted the search and a forensic chemist with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). The police officers testified respondent dropped a plastic bag containing a yellow substance from the window of \r\nthe second story apartment. One officer continuously observed the bag from \r\nthe window while another officer retrieved it. The forensic chemist testified \r\nthe substance contained in the plastic bag was crack cocaine.\r\nRespondent was the only defense witness. On cross-examination, the State introduced evidence of prior drug-related crimes to impeach him. \r\nRespondent's application for PCR was granted. The PCR judge found respondent's trial counsel was ineffective in failing to establish on the \r\n  record that respondent knowingly and intelligently waived his Fifth Amendment right not to testify against himself.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR court err in finding trial counsel ineffective for failing to establish on the record that respondent was informed of his right not to testify?\r\n  \r\n    A. Must the trial court establish on the record that a defendant understands his right not to testify?\r\n    B. If trial counsel was ineffective, was respondent prejudiced?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove the allegations in his application. Bell v. State, 321 \r\nS.C. 238, 467 S.E.2d 926 (1996); Rule 71.1(e), SCRCP. For an applicant to be granted PCR as a \r\nresult of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must show both: (1) his counsel \r\nfailed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms, and (2) he was prejudiced by his counsel's ineffective \r\nperformance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), \r\nJudge v. State, 321 S.C. 554, 471 S.E.2d 146 (1996). In order to prove prejudice, an applicant must \r\nshow that but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result \r\nof the trial would have been different. Johnson v. State, \r\n325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997). A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient \r\nto undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial. Id. If there is any probative evidence to support the findings of the PCR judge, those \r\nfindings must be upheld. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 \r\nS.E.2d 624 (1989). Likewise, a PCR judge's findings should not be upheld if there is no probative evidence to support them. Holland v. State, \r\n322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that \"[n]o person. . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" U.S. Const. Amend. \r\nV.1 The decision to testify or not is a perilous one. If a defendant does not testify, he foregoes the opportunity to tell the jury his version of events. \r\nOn the other hand, if a defendant chooses to testify, he subjects himself to \r\ncross examination, including possible impeachment with prior convictions. Rule 609, SORE. If a defendant chooses not to take the stand in his own \r\ndefense, the trial judge must, if requested, instruct the jury that the \r\ndefendant's failure to testify cannot be held against him or considered by the jury in \r\nany manner during its deliberations. State v. Gunter, 286 \r\nS.C. 556, 335 S.E.2d 542 (1985). A defendant's decision to testify or not must be made with knowledge of the consequences of either choice. See State v. \r\nOrr, 304 S.C. 185, 403 S.E.2d 623 (1991) (waiver of Fifth Amendment right must be knowing and voluntary), overruled in part on other grounds, \r\nState v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 314 (1991).\r\nAt his PCR hearing, respondent testified his attorney never informed him he did not have to testify and that the jury would be instructed not \r\nto hold his failure to testify against him. The PCR judge found as a fact respondent was not informed by the trial judge or defense counsel of his right not to testify, of the consequences of waiving that right, and that \r\nthe jury must be instructed not to hold his failure to testify against him. \r\nCiting Orr, the PCR court ruled the knowing and voluntary \r\nrequirement must be satisfied by an on-the-record colloquy. The PCR court thus ruled respondent's \"decision to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege and testify was not made knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently, but was based on \r\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel.\" The State argues the PCR court erred \r\nin creating an affirmative duty on the part of the trial court to obtain a \r\nwaiver on the record. We agree.\r\nA. Must the trial court establish on the record that a defendant understands his right not to testify?\r\nWe have previously addressed this question in Brown v. \r\nState, 317 S.C. 270, 453 S.E.2d 251 (1994). There we said \"[a]n on-the-record waiver \r\nof a constitutional or statutory right is but one method of determining \r\nwhether the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived that right.\" Id. at \r\n272, 453 S.E.2d at 252. While Orr can be read to require an \r\non-the-record colloquy to establish the voluntariness of any statutory or constitutional right, \r\nBrown made clear the requirement was limited to pre-Torrence 2 death \r\npenalty cases. We noted in Brown that \"[r]eview of this issue \r\nis better left to a post conviction relief proceeding where the facts surrounding the trial can be \r\nfully explored.\" Id.\r\nThe is precisely the type of case alluded to in Brown. While we \r\ndecline to require an on-the-record waiver of a defendant's right against \r\ncompelled testimony, we nonetheless find defense counsel was ineffective. The PCR court found as a fact respondent's trial counsel failed to inform respondent \r\nof his Fifth Amendment privilege and the consequences of waiving that privilege. Failure to inform a client of his Fifth Amendment rights and \r\nthe consequences of exercise and waiver of those rights falls below an \r\nobjective standard of reasonable representation.\r\nB. Was respondent prejudiced?\r\nThe second prong of the Strickland test for \r\nineffective assistance of counsel requires a PCR applicant to show prejudice, i.e., but for \r\ncounsel's error, there is a reasonable probability the result of the trial would \r\nhave been different. The PCR judge did not address this prong, although in granting post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel \r\nhe presumably found prejudice. The State argues the Court should reverse because respondent failed to show prejudice. We agree.\r\nRespondent was the only defense witness. On cross-examination, the State brought out respondent's prior drug-related arrests for impeachment purposes. This testimony was certainly damaging to respondent, and the damage was surely exacerbated by the failure of counsel to request, and \r\nthe trial court to give, limiting instructions.3 On the other \r\nhand, respondent explained the circumstances of the prior arrests and maintained his innocence of the charges for which he was being tried. Most importantly, respondent gave an innocent explanation for his presence in the apartment at the time of the raid and directly contradicted the testimony of the \r\npolice officers about dropping the bag of crack cocaine from the window. \r\nMoreover, respondent's testimony in other respects was very favorable to him.\r\nWe do not believe respondent was prejudiced, despite his assertion at his PCR hearing that he would not have testified at trial had he known \r\nhis prior record would come out on cross-examination. On the whole, his testimony was more helpful to him than harmful. Furthermore, there is no reasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different \r\nhad he chosen not to testify, because without his testimony, the jury would \r\nonly have heard uncontroverted evidence of respondent's guilt.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, MOORE, and WALLER, ii., concur. FINNEY, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nFINNEY, C.J.: I respectfully dissent because I disagree with \r\nthe majority's analysis of the prejudice issue in this case. When a post conviction relief (PCR) applicant alleges that he was denied the right to exercise one of his constitutional rights, the sole inquiry is whether he \r\nwas informed of that right, and if so, whether he validly waived it. If there is \r\nno knowing and intelligent waiver, then the remedy is a new trial. \r\nSee, e.g., Wroten v. State, 301 S.C. 293, 391 S.E.2d 575 (1990) \r\n(no valid waiver of right to counsel, new trial ordered); Prince v. State, 301 \r\nS.C. 422, 392 S.E.2d 462 (1990) (same). It is my view that the majority errs when it engages in speculation whether respondent would have fared better had he exercised the right he did not know he possessed. The evidence is uncontroverted \r\nthat respondent was never informed of his 5' Amendment right not to testify, \r\nand therefore we must affirm the PCR order granting respondent a new trial. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 \r\n(1989).\r\n1 This provision governs state as well as federal criminal proceedings. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964). Article I, Section 12, of the South Carolina Constitution contains similar language.\r\n2 State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 314 (1991).\r\n3 This error was not ruled upon as a basis for PCR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25079","title":"Calhoun v.

Calhoun, \r\n331 S.C. 157, 501 S.E.2d 735 (Ct. App. 1998). We affirm in part and reverse in \r\npart.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nIn this domestic action, the family court (1) \r\ngranted respondent a divorce on the ground of one year's continuous \r\nseparation; (2) denied petitioner's plea for alimony; (3) divided the \r\nparties' personal property by ordering respondent to pay petitioner $11,586, \r\nin addition to an in-kind distribution of the property; (4) awarded each \r\nparty 60% of the marital portion of their own retirement plan and 40% of the \r\nother's retirement plan resulting in an order that respondent roll over $28,152.20 \r\nto petitioner's retirement account; and (5) awarded petitioner $10,000 in \r\nattorney fees for retained counsel, but denied her request for attorney \r\nfees for the time she represented herself. Both parties appealed.\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed, as modified, \r\nfinding: (1) respondent was entitled to a credit of $4,976.80 on the \r\namount owed petitioner for personal property; (2) the appreciated value of the \r\nmarital home was $46,687 more than stated in the family court order and petitioner \r\nwas entitled to a 50% special equity in that amount; (3) petitioner was \r\nentitled to 50% of the $6,416 appreciation on the vacation home resulting from \r\nthe reduction in the mortgage on the home; and (4) petitioner was entitled to \r\nrecover expert fees and costs in the amount of $5,763. The Court of Appeals \r\naffirmed the remaining provisions of the family court order pertaining to the \r\nequitable distribution award and, pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, found the \r\nremaining issues argued by the parties to be without merit. \r\nId.\r\nPetitioner sought a writ of certiorari following \r\nthe denial of her petition for rehearing. We granted certiorari to \r\nreview the following issues: (1) whether petitioner, an attorney, is entitled to \r\nattorney fees for the time she represented herself; (2) whether she is entitled \r\nto post judgment interest on the equitable distribution award; and (3) whether \r\nthe Court of Appeals erred in refusing to consider her transmutation argument \r\nwith regard to respondent's vacation home.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(H)(Supp.1999) states that in divorce proceedings, the court, after \r\nconsidering the financial resources and marital fault of both parties, may order one \r\nparty to pay a reasonable amount to the other for attorney fees incurred, \r\nincluding sums for services rendered and costs incurred before the commencement of the \r\nproceedings and after entry of judgment, pendente lite and \r\npermanently. At trial, petitioner, an attorney, sought attorney fees for the time she \r\nrepresented herself.1She submitted \r\nan affidavit which indicated she spent 120.4 hours \r\ndefending this action. The family court denied petitioner's request for \r\nattorney fees without comment.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals acknowledged \r\nthat whether a pro se litigant who is an attorney should \r\nbe allowed to recover attorney fees is a novel issue in this state and that there is a \r\nsplit of authority on the issue in jurisdictions where it has been addressed. A \r\nmajority of those states have allowed pro se attorney litigants to \r\nrecover attorney fees,2while the \r\nminority rule denies such relief.3 The Court of \r\nAppeals aligned itself with those states which deny attorney fees to pro se \r\nattorney litigants. In doing so, the Court of Appeals held that the cardinal criterion for an \r\naward of attorney fees under Â§ 20-3-130(H) is that the party claiming a right \r\nto a fee has paid or owes another person money for legal services rendered and \r\nthat an attorney who appears on his or her behalf does not incur such an \r\nobligation. Petitioner maintains this holding is erroneous.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals' adoption of \r\nthe minority rule. The term \"incur\" is commonly defined as \"to \r\nbecome liable or subject to.\" THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY 653 (2d Ed. 1982); \r\nWEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1146 (1976). A pro \r\nse litigant, whether an attorney or layperson, does not become liable for or \r\nsubject to fees charged by an attorney. Accordingly, we hold that pro se \r\nlitigants are not entitled to attorney fees under Â§ 20-3-130(H).\r\n2.\r\nThe family court's September 21, 1995, order of \r\ndivorce gave respondent ninety days to pay petitioner $19,744 \r\nfor her interest in the marital home and to roll over $13,505.20 from his \r\nretirement account into petitioner's retirement fund. Both parties filed motions for \r\nreconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.\r\nBy order dated January 4, 1996, the family court \r\nreduced the amount it had ordered respondent to pay \r\npetitioner to $11,586, representing a miscalculation in the previous equitable \r\ndistribution of marital property, and increased the amount respondent was to roll over \r\ninto petitioner's retirement fund to $28,152.20. The family court granted \r\nrespondent ninety days to pay petitioner. Both parties again filed Rule 59(e) \r\nmotions. The motions were denied.\r\nPetitioner did not seek post judgment interest \r\nin her answer and counterclaim or in her first Rule 59(e) motion. \r\nInstead, the first time she requested post judgment interest was in her \r\nsecond Rule 59(e) motion filed on January 31,1996. Therein, petitioner requested \r\npost judgment interest on \"all money awards except [petitioner's] award of her \r\nshare of [respondent's] 401-k . . .\" 4\r\n\r\nOn appeal, petitioner asked the Court of Appeals \r\nto award her post judgment interest. The Court of Appeals found \r\nthat petitioner's January 31, 1996, motion for reconsideration was untimely \r\nbecause it was not served within ten days of either the September 21, 1995, order \r\nor the January 4, 1996, order; therefore, she could not complain about the \r\nfailure of the family court to award post judgment interest.\r\nPetitioner maintains she is automatically \r\nentitled to interest on the money judgment without regard to whether the \r\nRule 59(e) motion in which she first requested post judgment interest was \r\ntimely. We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B)(1987) \r\nstates that money decrees and judgments of courts enrolled or \r\nentered shall draw interest at a rate of 14% per annum. This Court has held that \r\nan equitable distribution award is a money decree or judgment, pursuant to Â§ 34-31-20, so that it accrues interest at the statutorily prescribed interest \r\nrate from the date of the judgment. Casey v. Casey, 311 S.C. 243, \r\n428 S.E.2d 714 (1993).\r\nWhere the law allows interest as a matter of \r\ncourse, it is unnecessary to make demand for it in the \r\npleadings. Anderson v. Citizens Bank, 294 S.C. 387, 365 S.E.2d 26 (Ct. \r\nApp. 1987); see also 47 C.J.S. Interest &amp;Usury Â§ 81 (1982)(\"(W]here interest is \r\npayable by virtue of statute or rule of court and not by virtue of contract, it is not \r\nnecessary to make a specific claim for interest in the declaration or complaint.\"). \r\nWhile pre judgment interest must be pled in order to be recovered, except in \r\ncases involving an agreement to pay a sum certain, this Court has recognized \r\nthat a claimant is entitled to interest from the date of the rendition of the \r\nverdict, or post judgment interest, as a matter of course. See Van Dolson v. \r\nEarles, 234 S.C. 593, 109 S.E.2d 456 (1959); see also Town of Bennettsville v. \r\nBledsoe, 226 S.C. 214, 84 S.E.2d 554 (1954); Rawls v. American Central Ins. Co., \r\n97 S.C. 189, 81 S.E. 505 (1914); Sims u. Goudelock, 41 S.C.L. (7 Rich.) \r\n9 (1853); Anderson v. Citizens Bank, supra.\r\nIndeed, Â§ 34-31-20(B) states that money decrees \r\nand judgments of courts enrolled or entered shall draw \r\ninterest at a rate of 14% per annum. Use of the word \"shall\" in a statutory provision \r\nindicates the provision is mandatory. Seckinger v. The Vessel Excalibur, 326 \r\nS.C. 382, 483 S.E.2d 775 (Ct. App. 1997)(certiorari denied April 24, 1998). As \r\npetitioner was entitled to post judgment interest as a matter of law, the fact \r\nthat her motion for reconsideration seeking such interest was \r\nuntimely or that she failed to seek it in her previous pleadings is \r\nirrelevant.\r\nA question then arises as to when the interest \r\nbegan to accrue and if it has continued to accrue during the \r\npendency of the appeals. Fixed awards of money for equitable distribution shall accrue \r\ninterest at the post judgment rate from the date of the judgment. Casey v. \r\nCasey, supra. Rule 58(a), SCRCP, states that upon a decision by the lower court, \r\nthe clerk shall prepare, sign, and enter the judgment without awaiting any \r\ndirection by the court. It states further that a judgment is effective only when \r\nso set forth and entered in the record. Rule 59(e), SCRCP, states that a motion \r\nto alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after \r\nreceipt of written notice of the entry of the judgment. Accordingly, the date of \r\njudgment is not effected by the filing of a Rule 59(e) motion.\r\nThe problem in the case at hand, however, is \r\nthat there were two judgments. The first judgment was rendered on \r\nSeptember 21, 1995, and the second on January 4, 1996. We must determine \r\nfrom which judgment the interest runs and whether it has continued to \r\nrun during the pendency of the appeals.\r\nThis Court has held that interest does not \r\naccrue during the pendency of an appeal when the appeal is made by \r\nthe judgment creditor on the basis of a claim of inadequacy and the appeal is \r\nunsuccessful. Barth v. Barth, 293 S.C. 305, 360 S.E.2d 309 (1987); Sears \r\nv. Fowler, 293 S.C. 43, 358 S.E.2d 574 (1987). The Court has never ruled on whether \r\ninterest accrues during the pendency of an appeal when the appeal is made by \r\nthe judgment creditor on the basis of a claim of inadequacy and the appeal is \r\nsuccessful.\r\nSome jurisdictions have held that when both the \r\njudgment debtor and judgment creditor appeal, the judgment \r\ncreditor is entitled to interest from the date of the judgment regardless of whether \r\nthe judgment creditor's appeal is successful. Other jurisdictions allow \r\ninterest to accrue despite an unsuccessful appeal if the judgment debtor's \r\nappeal was filed before that of the judgment creditor. Annotation, Right to \r\nInterest, PendingAppeal, of Judgment Creditor Appealing Unsuccessfully on Ground \r\nof Inadequacy, 15 A.L.R.3d 411 (1967); Annotation, Running of \r\nInterest on Judgment Where Both Parties Appeal, 11 A.L.R.4th 1099 \r\n(1982).\r\nStill another line of cases holds that where a \r\nmoney award has been modified on appeal, whether upward or downward, \r\nand the only action necessary in the trial court is compliance with \r\nthe mandate of the appellate court, the view has been taken that interest on \r\nthe award as modified should run from the same date as if no appeal had been \r\ntaken, that is, the date of entry of the judgment. Annotation, Date From Which \r\nInterest on Judgment Starts Running, as Affected by Modification of \r\nAmount of Judgment on Appeal, 4 A.L.R.3d 1221(1965); 45 Am. Jur. 2d \r\nInterest and Usury Â§ 80 (1999); 47 C.J.S. Interest and Usury Â§ 68 \r\n(1982).\r\nThe case before us is a perfect example of how \r\ncomplicated calculating post judgment interest can become \r\nwhen a money judgment is modified at several different junctures before \r\nreaching finality and why a bright line rule for the accrual of interest needs to \r\nbe established. While different jurisdictions have come up with creative and \r\ncomplicated methods of resolving the issue, it appears that the simplest way to \r\nresolve it is by adopting a rule that when a money judgment is finalized, whether \r\nin a lower court or in an appellate court, the interest on that amount, \r\nwhether it has been modified upward or downward or remains the same, runs \r\nfrom the date of the original judgment. To the extent this new rule is \r\ninconsistent with prior case law, that case law is overruled.\r\nWe therefore reverse the Court of Appeals' \r\nfinding that petitioner is not entitled to post judgment interest \r\nbecause it was not pled and because the Rule 59 motion in which petitioner \r\nrequested such relief was untimely. We further hold that petitioner is entitled to post \r\njudgment interest on the final amount determined by the Court of Appeals dating \r\nfrom the entry of the first judgment in the family court.\r\n3.\r\nRespondent owned a vacation home at Beech \r\nMountain in North Carolina prior to his marriage to petitioner. \r\nPetitioner sought to be awarded a portion of the market appreciation in the home \r\nduring the marriage. \r\nThe family court found that petitioner was \r\n  seeking a special equity in the home. The court found the vacation home \r\n  had previously been valued at $74,558 on January 19, 1988, \r\n  during previous litigation, and that it had appreciated in value by about 2% per year due to \r\n  inflation, giving it a value of approximately $77,570.00 as of the date \r\n  of the marriage. Using the same annual inflationary rate, the court found the \r\n  fair market value of the property on the date of filing was $84,000. Petitioner's \r\n  expert testified that the fair market value of the property on the date of \r\n  filing was $86,000. Accordingly, the family court found that only $2,000 of the \r\n  increase could be attributed to any factors other than inflation.5However, based \r\non the fact that petitioner did nothing to improve the property, spent little \r\ntime there with respondent after the marriage, and there was no evidence that \r\nrespondent spent significant marital funds on improvements to the property, \r\nthe family court concluded petitioner had no interest in the \r\nproperty.\r\nPetitioner argued in her motion to alter or \r\namend that the family court misinterpreted her claim in the home as \r\none based on special equity when she claimed the home had been transmuted into \r\nmarital property due to its exclusive dedication to marital use and the \r\nlarge amounts of marital funds expended on its use, maintenance and \r\nimprovement. Petitioner argued that as a result of the transmutation, she was entitled \r\nto have the market appreciation of the house included in the marital estate. The \r\nfamily court did not amend its ruling.\r\nPetitioner argued once again on appeal that the \r\nhome was transmuted as a result of its exclusive \r\ndedication to marital use, the time the family spent there, and the substantial amount \r\nof marital earnings expended on it; therefore, market appreciation of the \r\nhome should have been included in the marital estate. The Court of Appeals, citing \r\nformer Rule 207(b)(1)(B), SCACR, found that while petitioner argued the \r\nvacation home was transmuted to marital property, she only asked that the \r\nmarket appreciation of the home be included in the marital estate; therefore she \r\nhad limited the issue on appeal. 6\r\nPetitioner now argues \"Rule 207(b)(1)(B) does \r\nnot operate to waive the issue of transmutation fully preserved in \r\nthe record when the party limits the request for relief.\" We agree that the Court \r\nof Appeals erred in citing former Rule 207(b)(1)(B), but agree that by \r\nrequesting only a portion of the appreciation of the vacation home petitioner \r\nlimited her claim to one of special equity, not transmutation.\r\nFormer Rule 207(b)(1)(B) stated:\r\n\r\n  Statement of Issues on Appeal. \r\n    A statement of each of the issues presented for review. The \r\n    statement shall be concise and direct as to each issue, and may \r\n    be stated in question form. Broad general \r\n    statements may be disregarded by the appellate court. \r\n    Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not set \r\n    forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nThe statement of issue on appeal was worded as \r\nfollows: \"Did the trial judge err in excluding market appreciation \r\nduring coverture (of the second marital home) from the marital estate?\" However, \r\nthe argument on the issue contained discussion and citations to authority, \r\non transmutation. Given this fact, petitioner did not limit the issue on \r\nappeal by failing to refer to the term \"transmutation\" in her statement of the issue on \r\nappeal.\r\nHowever, petitioner did limit the issue on \r\nappeal by the relief she sought. In certain circumstances, nonmarital \r\nproperty may be transmuted into marital property if it (1) becomes so commingled \r\nwith marital property as to be untraceable; (2) is titled jointly; or (3) is \r\nutilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to \r\nevidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property. Peterkin v. \r\nPeterhin, 293 S.C. 311, 360 S.E.2d 311 (1987). When property is determined to have been \r\ntransmuted, the entire property, not just a portion of the property, is \r\nincluded in the parties' marital property which is thereafter apportioned by the \r\nfamily court using the criteria set forth in S.C. Code Ann: Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. \r\n1999).\r\nOn the other hand, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(5)(Supp. 1999) provides for a special equity in any increase in \r\nthe value of nonmarital property during the marriage to the extent the increase \r\nresulted directly or indirectly from efforts of the other spouse during \r\nmarriage. This is the relief petitioner sought.\r\nA family court cannot award relief beyond the \r\nscope of the pleadings. Coble v. Coble, 293 S.C. \r\n434, 361 S.E.2d 339 (1987). Since the relief sought by petitioner was that of a special \r\nequity, neither the family court nor the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to grant \r\nher relief pursuant to the doctrine of transmutation. Allen v. Allen, \r\n287 S.C. 501, 339 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the \r\nCourt of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and \r\nREVERSED IN PART.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Associate Justice \r\nDiane Schafer Goodstein, \r\nconcur.\r\n1 Petitioner also sought $11,000 in attorney's fees for retained counsel and $5,763 in costs. The family court awarded her $10,000 for retained counsel's fees, but required each party to bear his or her own costs. The Court of Appeals affirmed the award of attorney's fees, but found the family court abused its discretion in denying petitioner's request for costs. Finding that petitioner incurred fees for an appraiser, accountant, and psychologist and that she was ultimately successful on several issues concerning the equitable apportionment of the marital property, the Court of Appeals awarded petitioner her costs and expert fees.\r\n2 See Burrell v.

Petitioner did not raise that issue on appeal nor does she raise it to this Court. Petitioner is seeking post judgment interest on the money judgment only.\r\n5 Petitioner argued on appeal that the family court erred in its valuation of the market appreciation of the vacation home; however, the Court of Appeals did not rule on the issue. Petitioner did not raise that issue in her petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n6 Rule 207, SCACR, has been renumbered as Rule 208, SCACR.

We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 29, 1996, James Brian Cooke fell out \r\nof a 1987 Chevy Blazer to his death. His personal representative Judy \r\nBreland (\"Plaintiff') filed a wrongful death action against defendants General \r\nMotors, the car's manufacturer, and Love Chevrolet, the car's \r\nretailer (collectively the \"Defendants\"). The complaint alleged a defective \r\ndoorhandle and latching system caused Cooke's death.\r\nIn their answers, both defendants asserted that \r\nvenue was improper in Hampton County. Love Chevrolet is a resident of \r\nLexington County. General Motors is a foreign corporation. Plaintiff, a \r\nresident of Hampton County, argued venue was proper in Hampton County based \r\non General Motors being a resident of Hampton County. General Motors and \r\nLove Chevrolet denied that General Motors is a resident of Hampton County \r\nand argued venue should be transferred to Lexington County.\r\nThe trial court held a hearing on June 3, 1998 \r\nto consider the venue dispute. The trial court found General Motors \r\nwas a resident of Hampton County for venue purposes and therefore venue \r\nwas proper for both defendants in Hampton County pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30 (1976). The trial court ruled that General Motors had enough \"substantial and continuous\" contacts to qualify as a resident of Hampton \r\nCounty based on General Motors' 50 year relationship with a Hampton County car \r\ndealership. That local Hampton County dealership purchases and sells \r\nGeneral Motors cars and parts, uses General Motors techniques and assistance, \r\nand advertises General Motors' products. General Motors has done over $18 \r\nmillion in business in Hampton County over the previous 3 years. General Motors \r\nalso has several contractual relationships with divisions and subsidiaries in \r\nHampton County that retain security interests on the items kept on the \r\nlocal dealer's property: The local dealer even estimates that half of the cars \r\ndriven in Hampton County come from his local dealership.\r\nOn July, 31, 1998, Defendants fileda joint notice of appeal from the trial court's decision denying a transfer of venue. \r\nPlaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the trial court's \r\norder was interlocutory and not immediately appealable. The Court of Appeals \r\nissued an order dismissing the appeal on August 31, 1998. Defendants filed a \r\nmotion for rehearing that was denied on October 15, 1998. Defendants then \r\nappealed the following issue to this court:\r\n\r\n  Is a trial court's order denying a motion to \r\n    change venue immediately appealable?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Defendants argue an order denying a change \r\nof venue should be immediately appealable because: (1) such orders \r\nmeet the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2)(C) (1976); and (2) this \r\nCourt has entertained such appeals before. We disagree with both \r\narguments.\r\nI. Section \r\n14-3-330\r\nDefendants argue that under section \r\n14-3-330(2)(C) the order denying a change in venue is immediately appealable. We \r\ndisagree.\r\nThe relevant portion of section 14-3-330 \r\nstates:\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Court shall have appellate \r\n    jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in law cases, and \r\n    shall review upon appeal:\r\n  ...\r\n  (2) An order affecting a substantial right made \r\n  in an action when such order . . .(c) strikes out an answer \r\n  or any part thereof or any pleading in any action ....\r\n\r\nDefendants argue the trial court's order \r\naffected their substantial right to venue in the county of their residence and the refusal \r\nto transfer venue effectively struck out a portion of their \r\nanswer.\r\nWhether a defendant is a resident of a specific \r\ncounty is a question of law, not fact. Blizzard u. Miller, 306 S.C. \r\n373, 412 S.E.2d 406 (1991)(\"[T]his Court has held that when the motion to change venue is \r\nbased on the ground that a particular county is the residence of the \r\ndefendant, then a question of law is presented\"). Therefore, the questions in the \r\ncurrent case are whether the order denying the venue transfer: (1) affected; (2) a \r\nsubstantial right; and (3) struck part of the answer.\r\nA. \"Affecting\" a Substantial \r\nRight\r\nThe trial court's order did not \"affect\" the \r\nDefendant's right to venue in the county of its residence because any error in \r\nthe order can be corrected on appeal following the trial. Immediate appeals \r\nunder subsection (2) have been allowed in situations where the substantial \r\nright could not be vindicated on appeal after the case. See Creed v. Stokes, \r\n285 S.C. 542, 331 S.E.2d 351(1985). Generally, this subsection has only been used \r\nwhen the trial order affected the \"mode of trial\" because if those orders are not \r\nimmediately appealed, no appellate review is available to correct any \r\nerror. Id.\r\nDefendants argue that the fact that the order is \r\nappealable after the trial should not preclude immediate review of the \r\norder. Defendants rely on language from Link v. School District, \r\n302 S.C. 1, 393 S.E.2d 176 (1990) which held where an order falls under both \r\nsubsections, it does not have to be appealed immediately under subsection (2), but \r\nthe party may wait until the conclusion of the action to appeal the issue \r\nunder subsection (1). Defendants rely on language from a footnote in Link \r\nstating that \"some rulings controlled by Â§ 14-3-330(2) must be immediately \r\nappealed, or the right to review will be lost.\" Defendants assert the use of the word \r\n\"some\" reveals this Court will allow other immediate appeals even if the right would \r\nnot be lost if not immediately reviewed.\r\nCurrently, this Court does not allow immediate \r\nappellate review of the denial of any Rule 12(b), SCRCP \r\nmotion.1See \r\nWoodard v. Westvaco Corp., 319 S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995)(ruling the \r\ndenial of a Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP motion was not immediately appealable); \r\nMid-State Distribs., Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 \r\nS.E.2d 777 (1993)(ruling the denial of a Rule 12(b)(2),SCRCP motion was not immediately \r\nappealable); Moyd v. Johnson, 289 S.C. 482, 347 S.E.2d 97 (1986)(ruling the denial \r\nof a Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP motion was not immediately appealable). Also, \r\nthe denial of a Rule 12(c) motion is not immediately appealable. Rose v. \r\nThrash, 291 S.C. 459, 354 S.E.2d 378 (1987). The basic policy behind \r\ndenying immediate review of pretrial motions is avoidance of piecemeal litigation where the \r\nrights of the parties have not been substantially impacted. See Knowles v. \r\nStandard Sav. and Loan Ass'n, 274 S.C. 58, 261 S.E.2d 49 (1979)(ruling a \r\ndenial of a pretrial class certification was not immediately appealable).\r\nEven though the venue decision will not be \r\nrevisited by the trial court before the end of the case, we believe avoiding \r\npiecemeal litigation is the best policy to follow. The current case reveals why \r\nsuch appeals are disfavored. From the record on appeal, it is clear that \r\nGeneral Motors' substantial and continuous contacts with Hampton County will \r\nsustain the trial court's decision. We even have had the issue presented by this \r\ncase previously litigated in this Court. See Godley v. Uniroyal, Inc., \r\n278 S.C. 571, 300 S.E.2d 78 (1983).2 Already the progress of this case has been \r\ndelayed several years over the issue of venue. Requiring a defendant to wait until \r\nafter trial to appeal the issue of proper venue is the most appropriate course to \r\ntake where any error in that decision will not prejudice the defendant \r\nanymore than other interlocutory orders which, if in error, would require a new \r\ntrial. .\r\nSince any trial court error concerning venue \r\nwill be correctable upon appeal, the only damage a losing party will \r\nsustain is the expense of litigating in an improper county. Even though proper venue \r\nis a substantial right, we have previously found the avoidance of a trial \r\nis not a sufficient to justify immediate appellate review. See Shields v. \r\nMartin Marietta Corp., 303 S.C. 469, 402 S.E.2d 482 (1991). In this case, since \r\nany venue error will be correctable upon appeal after trial, we find the \r\nright of proper venue has not been affected such that the order would be \r\nimmediately appealable.\r\nII. Previous Cases Allowing Immediate \r\nAppeal\r\nThe Defendants argue that the order denying a \r\ntransfer of venue is appealable because this Court has entertained \r\nsuch appeals before. We disagree.\r\nOn several occasions, this Court has entertained \r\nimmediate appeals from orders granting or denying motions for change of \r\nvenue. See Ellis v. Oliver, 307 S.C. 365, 415 S.E.2d 400 (1992); Blizzard v. \r\nMiller, 306 S.C. 373, 412 S.E.2d 406 (1991); Carroll v. Guess, 302 S.C. 175, \r\n394 S.E.2d 707 (1990); Chestnut v. Reid, 299 S.C. 305, 384 S.E.2d 713 (1989). However, \r\nappealability was not an issue raised by any party in those cases. The fact \r\nthat an appellate court may have decided an appeal of a particular type of order \r\non the merits is not dispositive of whether the order is appealable when the \r\nissue of appealability was not raised. Woodard v. Westvaco Corp., 319 \r\nS.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995); State v. Lockhart, 275 S.C. 160, 267 S.E.2d \r\n720 (1980); Wallace v. Interamerican Trust Co. , 246 S.C. 563, 144 S.E.2d 813 \r\n(1965).\r\nThose cases also fail to discuss Godley v. \r\nUniroyal, Inc., 278 S.C. 571, 300 S.E.2d 78 (1983), Sanders v. Amoco Oil Co., \r\n283 S.C. 195, 320 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 1984), and Lewis v. Atkinson Implement \r\nCo. Inc., 280 S.C. 87, 311 S.E.2d 80 (Ct. App. 1983) which clearly hold such \r\norders are not immediately appealable. Therefore, Defendant's argument that \r\nthese cases support the appealability of such venue decisions is without \r\nmerit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the Court \r\nof Appeals is AFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting \r\nAssociate Justice R. Markley Dennis, Jr., \r\nconcur.\r\n1 Although the Defendants asserted improper venue in their answer, the analysis of this issue is identical to a Rule 12(b)(3), SCRCP motion.\r\n2 In Godley, this Court refused to review an order denying a motion by General Motors to change venue from Hampton County to Colleton County based on the residence of another instate dealer. The parties' alignment in this case is identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25081","title":"Great Games, Inc. et.al. v.

Cooper, Jr. and Nicholas \r\n                P. Sipe, both of South Carolina Department of \r\n                Revenue, of Columbia, for \r\n                respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J.: Respondent \r\n(Department) sought to impose sanctions upon appellants (Busters) for alleged \r\nviolations of a video gaming statute1 and \r\nregulation.2The \r\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ) upheld Department's citation, and Busters appealed to \r\ncircuit court. The circuit court first held it lacked subject matter \r\njurisdiction over the appeal, and alternatively, that the ALJ's order was \r\nsupported by substantial evidence. Busters now appeals to this Court. We affirm in \r\npart and reverse in part.\r\nBusters operated a video machine mall consisting \r\nof a common area from which six separate rooms, each containing \r\nfive machines, were accessible. On the day the Department's officer \r\ninspected Busters, all six rooms were lit and all thirty machines were \r\noperational. Two employees were present, both sitting at a table in the \r\ncommon area. Busters was cited for violating a regulatory requirement that each \r\nvideo machine \"place or premise\" have an employee present during \r\nbusiness hours.3 \r\nAs a result of the citation, Department sought \r\n  to revoke Busters' thirty licenses for this mall, impose a $5,000 fine, \r\n  and prohibit Busters from obtaining any new video poker licenses for the \r\n  mall location for six months. The ALJ revoked the thirty licenses, imposed a \r\n$1,500 fine 4, and \r\nprohibited the issuance of licenses. Busters was sanctioned \r\npursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-28-04(F)(Supp. 1998) upon a finding it had \r\nviolated Â§ 12-28-2804(A) and 27 S.C. Reg. 117-190.\r\nBusters appealed to the circuit court, which \r\nheld that because Busters failed to pay the $1,500 fine or post a bond \r\nbefore appealing as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-3370 (Supp. 1998), it \r\nlacked \"subject matter jurisdiction\"5 over Busters' \r\nappeal. Alternatively, the circuit court held the ALJ's order was supported by substantial \r\nevidence. We agree with Busters that Â§ 12-60-3370 does not apply to this type of \r\ncase, but affirm the circuit court's substantial evidence \r\nholding.\r\nSection 12-60-3370, a part of the \"Revenue \r\nProcedures Act\" (the Act), provides subject to certain exceptions not \r\napplicable here, \"a taxpayer shall pay, or post a bond for, all taxes, including \r\ninterest, penalties and other amounts determined.to be due by the [ALJ] . . . \r\nbefore appealing the decision to the circuit court.\" The purpose of the Act is \r\nset forth in Â§ 12-60-20:\r\n\r\n  It is the intent of the General Assembly to \r\n    provide the people of this State with a \r\nstraightforward procedure to determine any disputed \r\nrevenue liability. The South Carolina Revenue \r\nProcedures Act must be interpreted and construed in \r\naccordance with, and in furtherance of, that \r\nintent.\r\n\r\nThe critical issue here is whether the fine \r\nimposed by the ALJ pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2804(F) is a \r\ntax within the meaning of the Act. The circuit court held the language of Â§ 12-60-3370 clearly and unambiguously applied to the fine, citing only \r\nthis language from the statute: \" . . . a taxpayer shall pay or post a \r\nbond for, all . . . amounts determined to be due by the [ALJ] . . . before \r\nappealing the decision to circuit court.\" The circuit court judge's editing of the \r\nstatute selectively redacted the statute's relevant language, i.e., the \r\nrestriction of the bond/payment requirement to \"all taxes, including interest, \r\npenalties and other amounts.\"\r\nTurning to the Act's definitional section, it \r\nprovides that \"except when the context clearly indicates a different \r\nmeaning,\" tax or taxes is defined as:\r\n\r\n  All taxes, licenses, permits, fees, or other \r\n    amounts, including interest and penalties, imposed by \r\nthis title, or subject to assessment or collection by \r\nthe department, including property subject to \r\ncollection pursuant to Chapter 18 of Title 27. Â§ 12-60-30 (27) (Supp. 1998)\r\n\r\nStatutes should be construed in light of their \r\nintended purposes, and in ascertaining the intent of the legislature, a \r\ncourt should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider \r\nthe language of the statute as a whole. Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington \r\nInc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 476 S.E.2d 690 (1996). Statutes which are part \r\nof the same legislative scheme should be read together. Doe v. \r\nBrown, 331 S.C. 491, 489 S.E.2d 917 (1997). The Legislature explained its intent in \r\nenacting the Revenue Procedures Act: \"[T]o provide the people of this \r\nState with a straight forward procedure to determine any disputed revenue \r\nliability,\" Â§ 12-60-20, and in promulgating this Act, it expressly repealed all \r\nprovisions of Title 12 dealing with \"tax appeals.\" See 1995 Act No. 60, Â§ 41. That the Act concerns only tax appeals is clear from a reading of the Act \r\nas a whole, and it is also clear that the fine assessed against Busters for \r\nviolation of video poker regulations is not a tax within the meaning of the Act, \r\nsee Â§ 12-60-30(27), su ra, nor a tax within the ordinary definition of the term. \r\nSee, e.g., Powell v. Chaff, 260 S.C. 516, 197 S.E.2d 287 \r\n(1973):\r\n\r\n  The essential characteristics of a tax are that \r\n    it is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an \r\nenforced contribution; enacted pursuant to \r\nlegislative authority, in the exercise of the taxing power, \r\nthe contribution being of a proportional \r\ncharacter, payable in money, and imposed, levied, and \r\ncollected for the purpose of raising revenue, to be used \r\nfor public or governmental purposes. 84 C.J.S. \r\nTaxation s 1, at page 32. The question of whether a \r\nparticular contribution, charge, or burden is to be \r\nregarded as a tax depends on its real nature and not on \r\nits designation.\r\n\r\nWe reverse the circuit court's holding that Â§ 12-60-3370 applies to a fine imposed pursuant to Â§ 12-28-2804(F).\r\nBefore the ALJ, Busters challenged the \r\nconstitutionality of Reg. 117 190, and the ALJ purported to rule on these \r\nissues. We take this opportunity to remind the bench and bar that \r\nALJs are an agency of the executive branch of government 6, and must \r\nfollow the law as written until its constitutionally is judicially \r\ndetermined; ALJs have no authority to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute or \r\nregulation. See, e.,, Beaufort County Bd. of Educ. v. Lighthouse Charter \r\nSchool C'tee, Op. No. 24950 (S. C. Sup. Ct. filed June 1, 1999); South \r\nCarolina Tax Commission v. South Carolina Tax Board of Review, 278 S.C. \r\n556, 299 S.E.2d 489 (1983). In this case, although Busters raised the constitutional \r\nissues before the circuit court, that court failed to rule upon them, and \r\nBusters did not raise this omission in its Rule 59 motion. Accordingly, \r\nsince they were not ruled upon below, no constitutional claims are preserved \r\nfor our appellate review. Compare Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. \r\n360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct.App. 1997).\r\nThe last issue raised by Busters is a challenge \r\nto the circuit court's finding that substantial evidence supported the \r\nALJ's decision. We affirm.\r\nBusters argues that Department failed to prove \r\nthat the onsite employee violation occurred during \"business \r\nhours.\" The Department's officer testified \"The doors to all the rooms \r\nwere open, the machines were on, lights were on .... There were some players in \r\nsome of the rooms.\" This testimony is substantial evidence to support the \r\nALJ's finding that the violations occurred during business hours. e.g., \r\nLark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981) (\"substantial \r\nevidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \r\nadequate to support a conclusion\") (internal citation omitted). \r\n.\r\nWe agree with Busters that Â§ 12-60-3370 does not \r\napply to appeals involving fines imposed for violations of a \r\nvideo gaming statute and reverse that part of the circuit court's order. We \r\naffirm the circuit court's order finding substantial evidence supports the ALJ's \r\ndecision. Accordingly, the order under appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN \r\nPART.\r\nTOAL, MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., \r\nconcur.\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-28-2804(A)(Supp. 1998).\r\n227 S.C. Reg. 117-190 (Supp. 1998).\r\n3 In McNickel's Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 331 S.C. 629, 503 S.E.2d 723 (1998), we upheld Department's authority to promulgate this requirement.\r\n4A fine of $250 was imposed for each of Busters' six violations.\r\n5 The circuit court erroneously characterized the jurisdictional defect as one relating to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. Subject matter jurisdiction refers to the court's \"power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.\" Dove v. Gold Kist;, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598 (1994) (internal citations omitted). Only the circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction over agency appeals arising under the Administrative Procedures Act. S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-23-380(B); 1-23-390; 1-23-610 (1986 and Supp. 1998). The failure of a party to comply with the procedural requirements for perfecting an appeal may deprive the court of \"appellate\" jurisdiction over the case, but it does not affect the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n6 S.C.

Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; \r\n                and Solicitor George M. Ducworth, of Anderson, for \r\n                respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE, A.J.: \r\n  Appellant was convicted of two counts of murder, two counts of possession of a \r\nfirearm during commission of a violent crime, armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy.1 He appeals on \r\nthe ground hearsay evidence was improperly admitted. We \r\naffirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpenser Mansel was the State's lead witness. He \r\ntestified that on the night of October 16, 1996, he visited appellant \r\nat appellant's home. He and appellant discussed plans to rob and kill Tory \r\nGreen, a known drug dealer. The plan was to have Tory meet them at \r\nappellant's house and they would drive to a rural area in Tory's car. Bob Carter \r\nand Kevin Martin, two other friends also present at appellant's house that \r\nnight, agreed to pick them up after Tory was killed.\r\nSomeone called Tory to arrange a meeting. When \r\nTory arrived, Cynthia Jiminez was with him. Spenser, \r\nappellant, Tory, and Cynthia left together in Tory's car as planned. Tory drove \r\nand Cynthia was in the passenger seat. Appellant sat in the back behind \r\nCynthia and Spenser sat behind Tory. They drove to the designated spot \r\nand sat for a few minutes chatting. Appellant then shot Tory in the back \r\nof the head. Cynthia screamed and appellant shot her in the head. At \r\nappellant's direction, Spenser removed two bags of marijuana from \r\nTory's car. Appellant and Spenser began walking and Bob and Kevin picked \r\nthem up shortly thereafter.\r\nBob and Kevin corroborated Spenser's account of \r\nthe plan and the pick-up from the scene. Kevin testified \r\nappellant told him he had fired the shots. Forensic evidence corroborated that the \r\nshooter was sitting behind the passenger as Spenser had \r\ntestified. \r\nIn his defense, appellant testified that \r\n  although Kevin and Spenser came to his house the night of the murder, he \r\n  did not leave his house that night and he was not in the car when Tory and \r\n  Cynthia were killed.\r\nThe State's case also included the testimony of \r\nCynthia's cousin, Priscilla, who was with Cynthia and Tory while \r\nTory talked on the telephone before the meeting at appellant's house. \r\nPriscilla testified that when Tory hung up the phone, he told her he \"had to meet \r\nScott (appellant) and someone else\" who wanted to buy two or three \r\npounds of marijuana. Appellant contends the admission of this \r\nevidence is reversible error.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State moved in limine to admit Priscilla's \r\ntestimony that Tory planned to meet appellant on the night of the \r\nmurders. The State argued the evidence was admissible under Rule 803(1), SORE, \r\nas a present sense impression, or under Rule 803(3), SORE, as a \r\nthen existing state of mind, or under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), SORE, as a statement of \r\na co-conspirator. The trial judge ruled it was admissible as a present sense \r\nimpression, as a co-conspirator's statement, and as a statement \r\nagainst interest by an unavailable declarant under Rule 804(b)(3), \r\nSCRE. When Priscilla testified, no objection was made.\r\nFirst, an in limine ruling is not final and does \r\nnot preserve the issue for appeal. State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. \r\n502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993). Further, the evidence that Tory planned to meet \r\nappellant that night to sell him drugs is merely cumulative to the properly \r\nadmitted testimony of Spenser, Kevin, and Bob. There is no reversible \r\nerror in the admission of evidence that is cumulative to other evidence \r\nproperly admitted. State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 \r\n(1996).\r\nIn any event, Priscilla's testimony is \r\nadmissible under Rule 803(3) which provides for the admission of \"a statement \r\nof the declarant's then existing state of mind . . . (such as intent \r\n  [or] plan).\"2While this \r\nCourt has not specifically addressed the issue, several \r\nstate courts have found a statement by the victim that he or she planned \r\nto meet the defendant at the time or place of the murder is admissible under \r\nRule 803(3) as evidence of the declarant's then-existing state of mind. \r\nState v. Via, 146 Ariz. 108, 704 P.2d 238 (1985); State v. Abernathy, 265 \r\nArk. 218, 577 S.W.2d 591 (1979); State v. Taylor, 332 N.C. 372, 420 S.E.2d \r\n414 (1992); see generally Annotation, Admissibility of Evidence of \r\nDeclarant's Then-Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition under Rule \r\n803(3) of the Uniform Rules of Evidence and Similar Formulations, 57 \r\nA.L.R.5th 141, Â§ 5[a] (1998).\r\n\r\nWe conclude appellant cannot show prejudice from \r\nthe admission of Priscilla's testimony since the evidence Tory \r\nplanned to meet appellant was merely cumulative to other evidence that was \r\nproperly admitted. In any event, the evidence is admissible under Rule \r\n803(3) as evidence of the declarant's (Tory's) then-existing state of \r\nmind.3\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting \r\nAssociate Justice Edward B. Cottingham, \r\nconcur.\r\n1 Appellant was sentenced to two life terms for the murders, two five year terms for the firearm charges, twenty-five years for armed robbery, and five years for conspiracy, all to run consecutively.\r\n2 Although Rule 803(3) was not the basis for the trial judge's ruling, it was raised by the State as a ground for admission of the evidence. We may affirm on any ground appearing in the record. Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\n3This evidence is \r\nnot admissible as a statement by a co-conspirator since it was made to a bystander and did not \r\nadvance any purported conspiracy with appellant to sell drugs. \r\nState v. Anders, 331 S.C. 474, 503 S.E.2d 443 (1998) (statement by a co-conspirator \r\nmust advance the conspiracy to be admissible under Rule \r\n801(d)(2)(E)). Nor is it admissible under Rule 803(1) as a present sense impression. \r\nThis rule allows for the admission of \"a statement describing or \r\nexplaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving \r\nthe event or condition, or immediately thereafter.\" Tory's statement that \r\nhe was going to meet appellant was a statement regarding a future \r\nevent and not a statement regarding something contemporaneously perceived. \r\nFurther, it is questionable whether Tory's statement would be \r\nadmissible against appellant under Rule 804(b)(3). We recently held \r\nin State v. Fuller, Op. No. 24961 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 22, 1999), \r\nthat an unavailable declarant's statement against interest is not \r\nadmissible to inculpate the defendant. Unlike this case, however, in \r\nFuller the declarant's statement directly inculpated the defendant in the crime \r\nwith which he was charged. We express no opinion on the impact of Fuller \r\nin this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25083","title":"Blakeney v.

After his direct appeal was \r\ndenied, respondent filed an application for post-conviction relief (PCR). \r\nConcluding the Department of Corrections \r\n(DOC) did not properly credit respondent for time served while awaiting trial, the PCR judge granted respondent \r\nrelief and ordered the DOC to credit him with time served from \r\nSeptember 1, 1992. The Court granted the State's petition for a writ of \r\ncertiorari. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe \r\nrelevant facts are undisputed:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1. \r\nAugust 19, 1992 - Beaufort County robbery;\r\n\r\n2. August 21, 1992 - respondent arrested and \r\njailed in Berkeley County on unrelated charges;\r\n  \r\n3. August 31, 1992 - Beaufort County Sheriff's \r\nDepartment places a \"hold\" on respondent in Berkeley \r\nCounty;\r\n  \r\n\r\n4. September 1, 1992 - Beaufort County issues \r\n(but does not serve) arrest warrant;\r\n  \r\n\r\n5. Late 1993 - Berkeley County dismisses charges \r\nagainst respondent;\r\n  \r\n6. December 2, 1993 - respondent arrested on \r\nBeaufort County charge;\r\n  \r\n7. February 8-9, 1994 - trial and \r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, the DOC representative \r\ntestified the DOC gives credit for time served after arrest. \r\nAccordingly, the DOC gave respondent credit for time served from December \r\n2, 1993.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err by \r\nholding respondent should be given credit for time served from September 1, 1992, \r\nthe date on which the Beaufort County Sheriffs Department issued a \r\nwarrant for respondent's arrest?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-40 (1989) \r\nprovides:\r\n\r\nThe computation of the time served by prisoners \r\nunder sentences imposed by the courts of this State shall be \r\nreckoned from the date of the imposition of sentence .... In \r\nevery case in computing the time served by a_prisoner, full \r\ncredit against the sentence shall be given for time \r\nserved prior to trial and sentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIn Crooks v. State, 326 S.C. 171, 485 \r\nS.E.2d 374 (1997), the PCR applicant was released from prison on supervised \r\nfurlough. On April 7, 1993, he was arrested for violation of \r\nsupervised furlough and a charge of unlawful use of a telephone. He was returned to \r\nprison where he completed his original sentence on June 3, 1993. On July \r\n7, 1993, while in jail awaiting disposition of the unlawful use charge, the \r\napplicant was served with a second arrest warrant, again for unlawful use of \r\na telephone. The applicant pled guilty to both offenses. The Court held the \r\nPCR judge erred 1) by awarding the applicant credit for time served on \r\nthe April 7th warrant prior to June 3rd because he was serving time on \r\nanother offense and 2) by awarding credit on the second unlawful use of a \r\ntelephone charge for time served prior to the July 7th warrant because the \r\napplicant had not been charged with that offense until July 7th. In \r\neffect, Crooks held \"time served\" in Â§ 24-13-40 means the time during which a \r\ndefendant is in pre-trial confinement and charged with the \r\noffense for which he is sentenced (so long as he is not serving time for a prior \r\nconviction).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 21, 1992, respondent was arrested and \r\ntaken into custody in Berkeley County on charges unrelated \r\nto the Beaufort County robbery. On August 31, 1992, Beaufort County \r\nplaced a \"hold\" on respondent. The following day, September 1, \r\n1992, Beaufort County issued an arrest warrant charging respondent with the \r\nBeaufort County robbery. As of September 1, 1992, respondent was confined \r\n(through the \"hold\") and charged with the Beaufort County robbery. If \r\nBeaufort County had executed the arrest warrant on September 1, 1992, \r\nrespondent would have been entitled to bail; if unable to post a bond, he \r\nwould have been given credit for time served in the Berkeley County jail while \r\nawaiting trial on the Beaufort County charge. Beaufort County's decision not to \r\nexecute the arrest warrant until December 2, 1993, fifteen months later, \r\nshould not preclude respondent from receiving credit from September 1, 1992. \r\nSee Travis v. State, 724 So.2d 119 (Fla. App. 1 Dist. 1998) (at time arrest \r\nwarrant is transmitted or issued to another county and that county incarcerates \r\nthe defendant on unrelated charges, defendant is deemed to be in custody on \r\nthe warrants from both counties and therefore entitled to jail credit \r\non concurrent sentencing); see also People v. Shipp, 367 N.W.2d 430 \r\n(Mich. App. 1985) (where defendant was arrested in foreign county on unrelated \r\ncharges, warrant was issued on current charge, at some point later \"hold\" was \r\nplaced on defendant, and warrant was executed thereafter, defendant \r\nentitled to credit for time served in jail from time of \"hold\").

The Court of Appeals reversed. State v. Pinckney, 98-LTP-495 (Ct. App. filed November 9, 1998). We granted the State a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision. We reverse and remand to the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the trial judge erred in denying respondent a directed verdict?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held the trial judge erred in denying respondent's motion for directed verdict on the ground there was no evidence respondent entered the house with the intent to commit a crime therein. The State contends this was error. We agree.\r\nRespondent broke into the house of Mary Fleming. Fleming testified she heard noises outside her door at 6:30 a.m. The blinds and pictures on the wall began to shake. She heard glass shatter and she ran out the back door to a neighbor's house to call the police.\r\nOfficer Hamrick, the responding police officer, testified that upon arriving at Fleming's house, he heard yelling and shouting coming from the house. He testified that respondent shouted that he was going to kill him. Sgt. Rowe, another officer, joined him and they entered Fleming's house. They heard the sounds of objects being broken and they could smell a fuel type substance. Respondent had barricaded himself in Fleming's bathroom. He claimed there were people chasing him. Rowe testified respondent threatened to kill himself and the officers. He testified respondent also threatened to \"light the place up.\" After respondent was arrested and taken from the house, a lighter which did not belong to Fleming was found on the bathroom floor. Fleming testified that a glass oil lamp had been moved from a table. The State contends there was some evidence of arson, assault, malicious injury to property, and larceny. In reviewing a refusal to grant a directed verdict, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and determine whether there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove the defendant's guilt or from which his guilt may be logically deduced. State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 447 S.E.2d 177 (1993). On a motion for a directed verdict in a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight. State v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 319 S.E.2d 335 (1984). If the State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to prove the defendant's guilt, or from which the defendant's guilt could be fairly and logically deduced, the case must go to the jury. State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 431 S.E.2d 254 (1993).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst degree burglary requires evidence that the defendant entered a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling. S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Supp. 1998). In its opinion, the Court of Appeals held that the only evidence in the record of intent was that respondent entered the house to escape from people that he believed were after him. The Court of Appeals held \"the State presented no evidence of [respondent's] intent, at the time he entered the dwelling, to commit a crime inside.\" The Court of Appeals hinged its analysis on the time when respondent entered the house. The State contends respondent's actions after he entered the house and had barricaded himself in the bathroom were evidence of his intent to commit a crime in the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a burglary trial, the defendant's actions after he entered the house can be evidence used to determine if he had the intent to commit a crime at the time of entry. For example, if a defendant entered a house and committed criminal sexual conduct (CSC), the jury could find him guilty of burglary even though there may not have been any specific evidence that at the time he entered the house he intended to commit CSC. His actions after entering the house (i.e. the commission of the CSC) would be evidence of his reason for entering the house and would at least support the denial of a directed verdict motion. See e.g. State v. Faircloth, 297 N.C. 388, 255 S.E.2d 366 (1979)(citing State v. Tippett, 270 N.C. 588, 155 S.E.2d 269 (1967)(\"The intent with which an accused broke and entered may be found by the jury from evidence as to what he did within the house.\"). Here, respondent's actions after he entered the house were some evidence of respondent's intent to commit a crime therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge did not err in refusing to direct a verdict as it was for the jury to decide if respondent had entered the house with the intent to commit a crime inside. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' decision is reversed. As the Court of Appeals reversed Pinckney's convictions, it did not address his remaining issue whether the trial court erred in denying respondent's directed verdict motion on the ground of not guilty by reason of insanity. Accordingly, we remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of this issue. State v. Grovenstein, 335 S.C. 347, 517 S.E.2d 216 (1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL,WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur. FINNEY, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J.: I respectfully dissent. In my opinion, the Court of Appeals properly focused on the evidence of respondent's intent at the time he entered the home, as that is what the burglary statute requires. There is simply no evidence in this record that respondent harbored any criminal intent at this critical juncture. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25084","title":"Unison Ins.

S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30 (Supp. 1998). The Court of Appeals held petitioner was not an \"insured\" under the statute.\r\nWe reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties stipulated to the following facts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary O'Neale's father gave her a BMW with strict instructions not\r\nto let anyone else drive the car. On the night of November 27, 1992, Miss O'Neale and her friend Jennifer Hurst went to a party at Christopher Schmidt's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the party, Schmidt and Hurst got into the\r\nBMW. Schmidt later drove off in the BMW with Hurst asleep in the backseat. Schmidt lost control of the car and hit a tree, injuring Hurst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHurst had the consent of the owner of the BMW and of the\r\npermissive user daughter to occupy the vehicle to, from, and while attending the party. Schmidt's driving of the BMW was not consensual, but Hurst's\r\nuse of the BMW was at all times consensual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Farm, the carrier for the BMW, successfully denied liability coverage due to the non-permissive use by Schmidt. Hurst then\r\nclaimed the denial of liability coverage by State Farm rendered the BMW an uninsured motor vehicle. Hurst argued since she was a permissive occupant\r\nand/or guest and/or user of the BMW at the time of the accident, she was covered under State Farm's uninsured motorist policy and the uninsured\r\nmotor vehicle insurance statutes. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 (Supp. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court agreed. By order dated April 4, 1997, the trial\r\ncourt found Hurst was an insured under the uninsured motorist coverage of the State Farm policy in effect at the time on the O'Neale BMW, and the\r\nO'Neale BMW was an uninsured motor vehicle. Jennifer Hurst could therefore make an uninsured motorist claim against the State Farm policy\r\ninsuring the O'Neale BMW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed. Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 331\r\nS.C. 437, 503 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 1998). The Court of Appeals noted that for Hurst to be an insured under the statutory definition, she must be a\r\nguest in a motor vehicle \"to which the policy applies.\" See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n38-77-30(7) (Supp. 1998). Relying on the factually analogous Nationwide\r\nMutual Insurance Co. v. Harleysville, sue, 125 S.E.2d 840 (Va. 1962), the Court of\r\nAppeals held that Hurst was not an insured, because \"[w]hen Schmidt drove off in the BMW without permission, the BMW was no longer a motor vehicle\r\nto which the policy applied.\" Id. at 442, 503 S.E.2d at 214 (emphasis in\r\noriginal). Having concluded Hurst was not an insured, the court did not address whether the BMW was an uninsured motor vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding Hurst was not covered by the uninsured motorist policy on the\r\nO'Neale vehicle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Was Hurst an insured?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Was the O'Neale vehicle an uninsured motor vehicle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding Hurst\r\nwas not covered by the uninsured motorist coverage of the 0'Neale vehicle. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Was Hurst an insured?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7) (Supp. 1998) defines \"insured\" to\r\nmean:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe named insured and, while resident of the same\r\nhousehold, the spouse of any named insured and relatives of either, while in a motor vehicle or\r\notherwise, and any person who uses with the consent, expressed or implied, of the named insured the motor\r\nvehicle to which the policy applies and a guest in the\r\nmotor vehicle to which the policy applies or the\r\npersonal representative of any of the above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added): Respondent conceded for purposes of this appeal that\r\n\"[a] s a matter of law, as defined by the State Farm Mutual Insurance Company policy and the South Carolina uninsured Motorist Statute,\r\nJennifer Hurst was a guest and/or permissive occupant and/or&nbsp; permissive user of the O'Neale motor vehicle (BMW) at the time of the accident.\"\r\nRespondent's concession that Hurst was a \"guest and/or permissive occupant and/or permissive user\" of the vehicle places Hurst squarely within the\r\nstatutory definition of \"insured.\"1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even if Respondent had not conceded Hurst fell\r\nwithin the definition of \"insured\" under both the statute and the policy, we disagree with the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the uninsured motorist\r\nstatute. The uninsured motorist statute \"is remedial in nature, enacted for the benefit of injured persons, and is to be liberally construed so that the\r\npurpose intended may be accomplished.\" Gunnels v. American Liberty Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 242, 247, 161 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1968).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding the O'Neale\r\nvehicle was not a vehicle \"to which the policy applied.\" The Court of Appeals followed the factually analogous case of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v.\r\nHarleysville, 125 S.E.2d 840 (Va. 1962), in interpreting the clause \"to which\r\nthe policy applies\" to deny coverage. Unisun, 331 S.C. at 442, 503 S.E.2d at\r\n214. However, this Court has not interpreted the clause in such a restrictive manner. The \"motor vehicle to which the policy applies\" is \"the motor vehicle\r\ndesignated in the policy.\" Davidson v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 245 S.C.\r\n472, 477-78, 141 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1965). The words \"to which the policy applies\" are words of identification, and not words of exclusion as used by the\r\nCourt of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, we disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion the\r\nO'Neale vehicle was not being \"used with the consent of the insured.\" The Court of Appeals incorrectly focused on Schmidt's operation of the vehicle,\r\nrather than the \"use\" of the vehicle by Hurst, which Respondent stipulated \"was at all times consensual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Was the O'Neale vehicle an uninsured motor vehicle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause it found Hurst was not an insured, the Court of Appeals\r\ndid not address whether the O'Neale vehicle was an uninsured motor vehicle. Schmidt, 331 S.C. at 442, 503 S.E.2d at 214. We conclude the\r\nO'Neale BMW was an uninsured motor vehicle based on the plain language of the statute and public policy.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-30(13) defines \"uninsured motor vehicle\" to mean a\r\nvehicle as to which:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) there is not bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance both at least\r\nin the amounts specified in Section 38-77-140, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) there is nominally that insurance, but the insurer writing the same successfully denies\r\ncoverage thereunder ....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(13) (Supp. 1998). The O'Neale vehicle falls within\r\nthe plain language of the statute because respondent successfully denied liability coverage. See also Allstate Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 259 S.C. 586, 593, 193\r\nS.E.2d 517, 531 (1972) (appellant's uninsured motorist coverage became operative when respondent Allstate successfully denied liability for the other\r\nvehicle on ground that it was being driven without the consent of the insured).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the uninsured motorist law is \"to provide benefits\r\nand protection against the peril of injury or death by an uninsured motorist to an insured motorist, his family, and the permissive users of his vehicle.\"\r\nFerguson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 96, 100, 198 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1973). In the instant case, a permissive user (Hurst) was injured\r\nby an uninsured motorist (Schmidt). When State Farm successfully denied liability, the O'Neale vehicle became an uninsured motor vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe uninsured motorist statute does not appear to contemplate\r\nsingle-car accidents. We do not believe, however, the legislature intended an otherwise insured passenger to lose coverage when an unauthorized driver\r\ntakes the wheel. The. construction of the statute urged by respondent would relieve the carrier of responsibility when a named insured is the victim of a\r\ncarjacking. We will reject a statutory interpretation when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the\r\nlegislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention. Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994).\r\nOur interpretation of Â§ 38-77-30(13) comports with the plain language of the statute and advances its policies.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 See Hogan v.

Myers, of Lexington, for \r\nrespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: Gary Dubose Terry \r\nwas convicted of murder, first degree burglary, first degree criminal sexual conduct \r\n(CSC), and malicious injury to a telephone system. He was sentenced to death for \r\nmurder, thirty years each for burglary and CSC, and ten years for malicious \r\ninjury to a telephone. This case consolidates his direct appeal with the \r\nmandatory review provisions or S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985). \r\nWe affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe victim in this case, 47 year old Urai \r\nJackson, was found beaten to death in her Lexington County home on May 24, \r\n1994. The window on the carport door to her home had been broken out and \r\nthe telephone wires had been pulled from the phone box. Victim's mostly nude \r\nbody was found in the living room, and semen was found in her vagina. She had \r\nseveral blunt trauma wounds to the head, and a number of defensive \r\nwound injuries. The cause of death was blunt trauma with skull fracture and \r\nbrain injury.\r\nISSUES\r\n1. Did the court err in refusing to permit Terry \r\nto introduce his own statement to police into evidence? Should the \r\ncourt, in any event, have permitted Terry to elicit testimony to the \r\neffect that he had given a statement in order to demonstrate his cooperation with \r\npolice?\r\n2. Did the court err in ordering Terry to \r\ndisclose his Charter River Hospital records to the state?\r\n1. ADMISSION OF TERRY'S \r\nSTATEMENT\r\nOn March 24, 1995,1Terry gave a \r\nstatement to police in which he maintained he had gone to victim's house and had \r\nconsensual sex with her.2 According to Terry, the victim became angered \r\nwhen he started to leave and grabbed him by the hair. He lost his temper and \r\nstarted hitting her with something. He couldn't recall the object but \r\nbelieved victim may have brought it with her from the bedroom.3 He hit her \r\nseveral times then left.\r\nAt the outset of trial, Terry moved to suppress \r\nthis statement, contending it was involuntarily given. The trial judge \r\nconducted a Jackson v. Denno 4 hearing and ruled the statement \r\nwas admissible.\r\nTerry elected not to testify at trial. When the \r\nstate decided not to introduce the statement during the guilt or \r\ninnocence phase of trial,5 \r\nTerry contended he should be permitted to introduce it \r\nas a statement against his penal interest. The court ruled Terry could not \r\nintroduce the statement.\r\nTerry contends he should have been permitted to \r\nintroduce his confession as a \"statement against penal interest\" under \r\nRule 804(B)(3), S.C. Rules of Evidence (SORE), because he was \"unavailable\"6 as a witness \r\nby virtue of his exercise of his fifth amendment privilege \r\nagainst self-incrimination. We disagree.\r\nRule 804(B)(3) provides:\r\n\r\n(3) Statement Against Interest. A statement \r\nwhich was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's \r\npecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to \r\nsubject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a \r\nclaim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the \r\ndeclarant's position would not have made the statement \r\nunless believing it to be true. A statement tending to expose the \r\ndeclarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate \r\nthe accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly \r\nindicate the trustworthiness of the statement. (emphasis \r\nsupplied)\r\n\r\nInitially, Terry's purpose in offering the \r\nstatement was in an attempt to provide the jury with some \r\nevidence tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter. Accordingly, as he intended to \r\noffer the statement to exculpate himself, it was not admissible \"unless \r\ncorroborating circumstances clearly indicate[d] [its] trustworthiness.\" We \r\nfind no such corroborating circumstances.7 See State \r\nv. Doctor, 306 S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (1992) (testimony of three witnesses corroborated out \r\nof court confessions of declarants). Accordingly, the trial court \r\nproperly declined to admit the statement.\r\nIn any event, we concur with the trial court's \r\nruling that Terry could not use his fifth amendment privilege against \r\nself-incrimination as both a sword and a shield.\r\nSeveral courts have been faced with the issue of \r\n\"whether a defendant who has procured his own unavailability by \r\ninvoking his protection against self incrimination is \"unavailable\" as a witness for \r\npurposes of Rule 804(B)(1)(former testimony). In U.S. v. \r\nKimball, 15 F.3d 54 (1994), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held a defendant who \r\ncreates his own unavailability by invoking his fifth amendment privilege \r\nagainst self-incrimination is not \"unavailable,\" stating, \"While sensitive to the \r\nimportance of not discouraging or prejudicing a defendant who invokes the fifth \r\namendment; we cannot accept the view proposed by Kimball. A defendant \r\nseeking to testify and make exculpatory statements must face \r\ncross-examination. That is a basic rule of our adversary system.\" To hold otherwise would \r\npermit \"the criminally-accused to set out all the facts which fall in his favor \r\nwithout laying himself open to cross examination.\" Castro v. State of Texas, \r\n914 S.W.2d 159, 163 (Tex. Ct. App. 1995). Accord Dennis v. State of Texas, \r\n961 S.W.2d 245 (Tex Ct. App. 1997)(testimony's sponsor may not make himself \r\nunavailable by invoking fifth amendment privilege and then benefit from that \r\nunavailability). While the above-cited cases involve the \"former testimony\" \r\nexception to the hearsay rule, we find the same policy considerations apply \r\nhere. Accordingly, we hold the circuit court properly refused to allow Terry to \r\nintroduce the statement.\r\nTerry next asserts that, even if the trial court \r\nproperly excluded his statement to police, he should have been \r\npermitted to elicit the fact that he had given a statement in order to demonstrate that \r\nhe had cooperated with police. He contends the jury \"was left with the \r\nerroneous impression [he] stood silent in the face of an accusation that he committed \r\nmurder.\" We disagree.\r\nInitially, defense counsel told the jury Terry \r\nhad given a confession. Accordingly, his claim that the jury had the \r\nerroneous impression he had not cooperated with police is simply \r\nuntenable.\r\nIn any event, the fact that Terry gave police a \r\nstatement was simply irrelevant to any issue at trial. Admission of \r\nthe fact that Terry cooperated with police, without giving the substance of the \r\nstatement, would, in our opinion have been confusing and misleading to the jury. \r\nAccord, People v. Harvey, 208 Ca1.Rptr. 910, 925, 163 Ca1.App.3d 90, 115 \r\n(1985)(as with \"absence of flight,\" evidence of a defendant's cooperation with \r\nauthorities may not necessarily indicate innocence and is therefore properly \r\nexcluded in light of possibility of confusing the jury). Accordingly, we find it was \r\nproperly excluded. Moreover, given the fact that Agent Frier testified Terry \r\nwas cooperative in all his dealing with police, and defense counsel reiterated this \r\nfact to the jury in closing, we discern neither error nor prejudice in exclusion \r\nof this evidence.\r\n2. CHARTER RIVER \r\nRECORDS\r\nPrior to trial, the State moved for disclosure \r\nof medical records from Charter Rivers Hospital pertaining to treatment \r\nTerry received there from August 21st- 30th, 1994, 8 approximately \r\nthree months after the murder. The solicitor had information the admission was for \r\nanger control and substance abuse and contended the records were relevant to \r\nthe penalty phase of a capital trial insofar as they reflected the character of \r\nthe defendant. The defense argued the records were not discoverable under \r\nRule 5, citing State v. Parker 9  and McMakin v. Bruce Hospital. 10 The trial \r\ncourt ordered disclosure. We find no error.\r\nAlthough S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-11-95(b)(1) \r\nprohibits a mental health provider from knowingly revealing confidences of \r\npatients, an exception is set forth in Â§ 19-11-95(d)(1) which provides, in \r\npertinent part:\r\n\r\n(D) A provider shall \r\nreveal:\r\n  \r\n(1) confidences when required by statutory law \r\nor by court order for good cause shown to the extent that \r\nthe patient's care and treatment or the nature and extent of \r\nhis mental illness or emotional condition are reasonably at \r\nissue in a proceeding... (emphasis \r\nsupplied).\r\n  \r\n\r\nGiven that this is a capital case, the jury was \r\nrequired to assess Terry's character. State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, \r\n478 S.E.2d 260 (1996) (it is essential the jury in a capital case have all possible \r\nrelevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must \r\ndetermine; jury's attention must be focused on both the specific circumstances of \r\nthe crime and the characteristics of the person who committed it). See also \r\nWoodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 304, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944, \r\n961(1976) (in capital cases, the Eighth Amendment requires consideration of the \r\ncharacter and record of the individual offender as a constitutionally \r\nindispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death); State v. \r\nGreen, 301 S.C. 347, 392 S.E.2d 157 (1990), cert. denied 111 S.Ct. 229, 498 \r\nU.S. 881, 112 L.Ed.2d 183 (evidence of defendant's character properly admitted in \r\npenalty phase of a capital trial). Accordingly, we find Terry's mental and \r\nemotional status were \"reasonably at issue\" in the proceeding and the trial court \r\nproperly ordered disclosure pursuant to Â§ 19-11-95(D). See generally \r\nWanda Ellen Wakefield, Annotation, Physician-Patient Privilege as Extending to \r\nPatient's Medical or Hospital Records, Â§ 7,10 ALR 4th 552 \r\n(1981)(majority ofjurisdictions permit introduction of such records in criminal trials under similar \r\nstatutory exceptions).\r\nTerry also asserts the trial court failed to \r\nmake a sufficient showing of factual necessity to warrant disclosure as \r\nrequired by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-22-100, and this Court's opinions in McMakin \r\nand Parker. We disagree.\r\nSection 44-22-100. permits disclosure if a \r\n\"court directs disclosure is necessary for the conduct of proceedings before \r\nit and that failure to make the disclosure is contrary to the public interest.\" \r\nThe trial court here specifically found the records were necessary,11 that good \r\ncause had been shown, that other means were unavailable to \r\nobtain the information, and that public need outweighed the need for \r\nprivacy. Here, given that the state did not know precisely what information was contained in the \r\nCharter Rivers Records, it is patent it could not have discovered the \r\ninformation through other means.12 Further, we find\r\ngood cause was shown by the \r\nstate insofar as the records were relevant to the defendant's \r\ncharacter.\r\nFinally, in his case in mitigation, Terry's \r\nexpert, Jan Vogelsang, testified concerning his explosive outbursts, use of \r\nalcohol and drugs, and the fact that he could adapt to prison with appropriate \r\nintervention. Vogelsang specifically testified concerning the diagnoses from Charter \r\nRivers. Moreover, Terry's three other experts relied on these records in \r\ntestifying during his case in mitigation. Accordingly, given Terry's own reliance on these \r\nrecords as mitigating evidence, we discern no prejudice. The trial court \r\nproperly ordered disclosure of the records to the state.\r\nTerry's remaining issue is affirmed pursuant to \r\nRule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities. State v. \r\nNance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349, cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1026, 116 S.Ct. 2566, \r\n135 L.Ed.2d 1083 (1996) (relevance, materiality and admissibility of photographs are \r\nmatters within the sound discretion of the trial court); State v. \r\nKornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 350 S.E.2d 180 (1986).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTerry's convictions and sentences are affirmed. \r\nAfter a review of the record, we find the death sentence was not the \r\nresult of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the jury's \r\nfindings of statutory aggravating circumstances are supported by the evidence. \r\nSee S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985). Further, the death penalty is neither \r\nexcessive nor disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases. State v. \r\nCouncil, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999); State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 512 \r\nS.E.2d 99 (1999).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, MOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., concur. FINNEY, C.J., dissenting\r\nin a separate opinion.\r\n1 He gave another \r\nstatement on Jan. 17,1995 which is not at issue in this appeal.\r\n2 He had previously \r\nlived across the street from victim.\r\n3 The bottom half of a \r\npool cue victim generally kept for protection was missing from her home and was never \r\nrecovered.\r\n4 378 U.S. 364 \r\n(1964).\r\n5 The state elected, \r\ninstead, to rely on a fingerprint on the phone box which matched the print from Terry's right ring \r\nfinger, and semen from Victim's vagina which matched Terry's DNA \r\nprofile.\r\n6Under Rule 804(B), \r\ncertain statements are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a \r\nwitness. \"Unavailable\" is defined in 804(A) and includes situations in which the \r\ndeclarant is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from \r\ntestifying concerning the subject matter, of the declarant's statement.\r\n7 Terry asserts the \r\npathologist testified victim did not suffer any sexual \"trauma,\" thereby corroborating his claim of \r\nconsensual sex. On the contrary, the pathologist specifically testified the fact \r\nthat there was no vaginal tearing or bruising did not indicate there was no \r\nassault, but that the semen found in the vaginal canal indicated \"quite the \r\nopposite.\"\r\n8 Terry went to Charter \r\nRivers to avoid incarceration as a result of an arrest for assault.\r\n9 294 S.C. 465, 366 \r\nS.E.2d 10 (1988).\r\n10 318 S.C. 15, 455 \r\nS.E.2d 693 (1995).\r\n11 Terry's reliance on \r\nState v. Parker, supra, is misplaced. In that case, this Court specifically noted that no exceptions \r\nto S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-23-1090 were applicable. Section 44-23-1090, like \r\nsection 44-22-100, permits an exception if the trial court finds, as the trial \r\ncourt did here, that disclosure of the records is necessary for the conduct of \r\nproceedings before it.\r\n12 For this reason, \r\nthe trial court properly found the state had no other means of obtaining this information and Terry's \r\nreliance on State v. McMakin, supra, is misplaced.\r\n\r\n \r\nFINNEY, C.J.: I respectfully \r\ndissent. In my opinion, the refusal to admit appellant's statement constitutes \r\nreversible error under the facts of this case. I would reverse and remand for a new \r\ntrial.\r\nI agree with the majority that appellant's \r\nstatement was not admissible under Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE. I base my \r\nconclusion not on the fact that the statement is \"exculpatory,\"1 nor that it \r\nwas not corroborated, 2nor \r\non the fact that the majority is again 3 willing to \r\npermit counsel's argument to substitute for evidence, but rather on the plain \r\nlanguage of the rule itself. \"A statement tending to expose the declarant to \r\ncriminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible . . . .\" \r\nIt is clear this rule contemplates that the accused and the declarant \r\nare different people.\r\nI would, never-the-less, reverse this case in \r\nlight of what I perceive as improper actions by the solicitor. Prior to the \r\ntaking of testimony, appellant moved to suppress this confession. The State \r\nopposed the motion, and following a Jackson v. Denno 4 hearing, \r\nthe trial judge ruled the statement would be admitted. In order to defuse the \r\nstatement's impact, defense counsel acknowledged to the jury during his \r\nopening statement that appellant had given a confession in which he \r\nadmitted having intercourse with the victim, and then killing her. The \r\nsolicitor, however, never introduced the statement and appellant then \r\nsought to introduce it through the testimony of the police officer. This \r\nrequest was refused.\r\nIn my opinion, the solicitor's actions in this \r\ncapital case constitute `sandbagging'.5 I would not condone this type of \r\nconduct, but would hold that under these circumstances, the refusal to \r\nadmit the statement was reversible error. Accordingly, I would reverse \r\nand remand for a new trial.\r\n1 It clearly exposes \r\nappellant to criminal liability.\r\n2The majority \r\nmisunderstands the corroboration requirement: it goes not to the contents of the statement or its \r\ntruth, but to the trustworthiness of the statement itself. See State v. \r\nKinloch, Op. No. 25044 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed January 10, 2000). On the merits, I simply do \r\nnot understand how the mere presence of semen in the victim's vagina is \r\nproof of nonconsensual sexual activity as the majority asserts in footnote \r\n7.\r\n3See, e.g., \r\nState v. Hughes, 328 S.C. 1462493 S.E.2d 821 (1997)(Finney, C.J., dissenting) (argument of \r\ncounsel is not evidence). Further, as explained later, under the \r\ncircumstances here to use counsel's admission in his opening statement to render the \r\nrefusal to admit the statement harmless is disingenuous at best. \r\nFinally, I do not understand how the majority can conclude in one paragraph \r\nthat counsel's reference to the confession renders \"(appellant's] claim that \r\nthe jury had the erroneous impression he had not cooperated with police... \r\nsimply untenable\", yet hold in the very next paragraph that to let the jury \r\nknow the fact that appellant gave a confession \"would have been confusing and \r\nmisleading to the jury\" and therefore evidence of its existence was \r\nproperly excluded.\r\n4 378 U.S. 364 (1964).\r\n5 It was the uncorroborated fear of the use of \r\nthis type tactic by defense counsel that led a majority of this Court to \r\nabolish in favorem vitae review. State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 \r\nS.E.2d 315 (1991) (Toal, A.J., concurring).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25086","title":"Allen v.

We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAllen was arrested and incarcerated on June 4, \r\n1996 for two counts of grand larceny and one count of malicious injury \r\nto property. He remained in jail for eighteen days (until June 22, 1996), at \r\nwhich time he was released on bond. Allen was re-arrested on separate \r\ncharges1 \r\nfour days later (June 26, 1996), and his bond on the June 4th charges was \r\nrevoked. He remained in jail until September 12, 1996, when he pled guilty to \r\nall five offenses. He filed this application for PCR claiming he had not been \r\ngiven credit on the charges stemming from his June 4th arrest for the time \r\nserved from June 26, 1996 until September 12, 1996.2 The PCR court \r\nruled Allen was not entitled to credit for time served on those charges. We \r\ndisagree.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nS.C. Code Â§ 24-13-40 (1989) \r\nprovides:\r\nThe computation of the time served by prisoners \r\nunder sentences imposed by the courts of this State shall be reckoned \r\nfrom the date of the imposition of the sentence .... In every case in \r\ncomputing the time served by a prisoner, full credit against the \r\nsentence shall be given for time served prior to trial and sentencing. Provided, \r\nhowever, that credit for time served prior to trial and sentencing shall not \r\nbe given: (1) when the prisoner at the time he was imprisoned prior to trial was an \r\nescapee from another penal institution; or (2) when the prisoner is \r\nserving a sentence for one offense and is awaiting trial and sentence for a \r\nsecond offense in which case he shall not receive credit for time \r\nserved prior to trial in a reduction of his sentence for the second offense. (Emphasis \r\nsupplied).\r\nWhere the terms of a statute are clear, the \r\ncourt must apply those terms according to their literal meaning. Paschal \r\nv. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995). The words of the \r\nstatute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle \r\nor forced construction to limit or expand its scope. Durham v. United \r\nCompanies Financial Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 503 S.E.2d 465 (1998).\r\n\r\nSection 23-13-40 mandates a prisoner be given \r\ncredit for all time served prior to trial unless one of two exceptions \r\nexist: 1) either the prisoner was an escapee or 2) the prisoner was already serving a \r\nsentence on one offense. Here, neither exception applies as Allen was neither \r\nan escapee nor was he serving any sentence at the time of his June 26th \r\n  arrest.3 On \r\nthe contrary, Allen was awaiting trial and sentencing on all offenses \r\nfrom June 26th through Sept. 12th.\r\nMoreover, Allen's bond was revoked on the first \r\nset of charges. He was, therefore, clearly in custody on all charges \r\nfrom June 26th through September 12th. Accord People v. Robinson, 667 \r\nN.E.2d 1305 (Ill. 1996)(defendant released on bond on one charge, then subsequently \r\narrested on another charge; defendant turned himself in on first charge \r\nwhen, as a result of second charge, bond on first charge was increased to degree \r\nthat defendant could not pay it. Court held defendant was simultaneously in \r\ncustody on both charges such that he was entitled to credit for time served on \r\nboth); Goings v. Missouri Dep't of Corrections, 6 S.W. 3d 906 (Mo. \r\n1999)(inmate whose parole was revoked for prior offenses when he was arrested for a subsequent \r\noffense was entitled to credit for time served for both prior and current \r\noffenses). See also State v. Eagle Deer, 1994 WL 162369 (Neb. 1994) \r\n(defendant released on bond on one charge, then subsequently arrested on another charge for \r\nwhich bond is revoked on first charge, is entitled to credit for time served on \r\nfirst charge from time of revocation of his bond).\r\nUnder the plain, unambiguous terms of the \r\nstatute, we find Allen is entitled to credit for the time served on the \r\nfirst set of charges between June 26th and September 12th. The circuit court's \r\norder denying PCR is reversed.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, \r\nMOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1 The second arrest involved charges of petit larceny and breaking into a motor vehicle.\r\n\r\n2 He also claimed his five year sentence for malicious injury to property exceeded the 30 day statutory maximum. The state conceded this issue and Allen was granted relief and the matter is not before the Court.\r\n\r\n3 Crooks v. \r\n    State, 326 S.C. 171, 485 S.E.2d 374 (1997) involved an \r\ninmate on supervised furlough who was served with an \r\narrest warrant and reincarcerated for another offense while on \r\nfurlough.

A jury awarded actual \r\nand punitive damages to Clark and Anderson.1 The Court of \r\nAppeals affirmed the verdicts and awards. Clark v. Cantrell, 332 S.C. 433, 504 S.E.2d 605 \r\n(Ct. App. 1998). We granted Cantrell's petition for a writ of certiorari to review that \r\ndecision. We affirm as modified:\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after dark on November 1, 1993, \r\nCantrell, driving a late model Mustang GT with hazard lights flashing, \r\nsped down Highway 24 toward Anderson. The driver of a pickup truck that \r\nCantrell passed on a two-lane stretch of road estimated Cantrell was traveling \r\n75 to 80 mph, and she nearly collided with the pickup truck while swerving \r\nback into the right lane. The pickup driver believed the Mustang, which \r\ncontinued to pass other vehicles in a similarly hazardous manner, had to be headed \r\nfor the hospital.\r\nSome distance down the highway, Anderson and a \r\nfriend were headed to Georgia to buy tickets in the new \r\nlottery. Anderson, a nursing assistant at the local hospital, intended to gas \r\nup her 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass and was waiting to turn left into a Hess service \r\nstation.\r\nCantrell sped through an intersection a short \r\ndistance from the Hess station, entering a busy stretch of \r\nfour-lane highway flanked by restaurants and other retail businesses. The \r\nspeeding Mustang scared a man whose wife, accompanied by their three boys, was \r\ntaking him to his night-shift textile job. The man estimated the Mustang was \r\ntraveling 75 to 100 mph.\r\nAnderson waited for a car or two to go by, then \r\nbegan turning left across two lanes of traffic. The front of her \r\ncar was at the entrance of the service station lot when Anderson glimpsed a \r\nsmall \"turbo car\" speeding toward her. The textile worker, still watching \r\nCantrell's speeding car from the nearby intersection, saw it strike the right rear side \r\nof Anderson's Oldsmobile. The impact flung Anderson's friend, David James, \r\nfrom the car, killing him.\r\n\r\nA state Highway Patrol trooper who reconstructed \r\nthe accident scene pegged the Mustang's speed at 67 to 71 mph \r\nwhen Cantrell first applied her brakes. An accident reconstruction expert \r\nhired by Cantrell estimated her car was traveling 57 mph. The posted speed limit \r\nwas 35 mph. The trooper and Cantrell's expert testified that, if she had \r\nbeen traveling 35 mph, the accident probably would not have occurred. Cantrell's \r\nexpert also testified that he believed the primary cause of the accident was \r\nAnderson's decision to turn left in front of Cantrell's oncoming \r\ncar.\r\nWhen Cantrell emerged from her car, she was \r\nupset and screaming about the condition of her car, demanding that \r\nbystanders look at what had happened to it. She laughed as a trooper talked \r\nto her a short while later, although her laughter ended when she was \r\ninformed someone had died in the accident. Cantrell told a trooper the next day \r\nthat she was speeding because her car was low on gas and she was in a hurry to \r\nreach a station.\r\nAnderson and Clark alleged that Cantrell had \r\ncaused their injuries and damages by speeding on the busy highway: \r\nCantrell's primary defense was that Anderson caused the accident by turning \r\nleft in front of her. The jury found Anderson sixteen percent at fault and \r\nCantrell eighty-four percent at fault in the accident. The jury awarded Anderson \r\n$75,000 in actual damages and $25,000 in punitive damages; and Clark, the \r\nvehicle's owner, $3,000 in actual damages and $750 in punitive damages. The \r\ntrial judge reduced the actual damages, but not the punitive damages, by \r\nthe proportion of Anderson's fault.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n      Did the Court of- Appeals err in holding that punitive damages are not reduced by the proportion of the plaintiffs negligence under comparative negligence?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n      Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial judge's refusal to admit Cantrell's computer-generated video animation of the accident as demonstrative evidence?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      3.\r\n      Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial judge's refusal to give Cantrell's requested charge regarding excessive speed?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      4.\r\n      Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial judge's refusal to instruct the jury on the sudden emergency doctrine?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PUNITIVE DAMAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nCantrell contends the Court of Appeals erred in \r\nholding that punitive damages, unlike actual damages, are not \r\nreduced by the proportion of the plaintiffs negligence under comparative \r\nnegligence. Cantrell argues punitive damages should be reduced \r\nproportionately because such damages serve, in part, a compensatory role. She relies \r\non several cases decided before the adoption of comparative negligence in 1991. \r\nFurther, Cantrell asserts that reducing punitive damages is consistent with the \r\nadoption of comparative negligence because it focuses on both parties' \r\ndegree of fault in causing an accident. We disagree.\r\nWe are free to decide this novel question of law \r\nwith no particular deference to the lower court. See S.C. \r\nConst. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1999); \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 1999) (granting Supreme Court and Court of \r\nAppeals the jurisdiction to correct errors of law in both law and equity actions); \r\nI'On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, Op. No. 25048 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 17, 2000) \r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 1).\r\n\r\nComparative negligence is the law in South \r\nCarolina. Nelson v.Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 399 \r\nS.E.2d 783 (1991). The jury must apportion fault between the plaintiff and \r\ndefendant in a negligence action. The plaintiff may recover damages when his or her \r\nnegligence is not greater than that of the defendant. The plaintiffs damages, \r\nhowever, are reduced in proportion to the amount of his or her \r\nnegligence. Id. The parties agree that Nelson requires the reduction of \r\nplaintiffs actual damages. The novel issue presented in this case is whether the court must \r\nreduce punitive damages won by the plaintiff in proportion to the amount of \r\nhis or her negligence. The purpose of actual or compensatory damages is \r\nto compensate a party for injuries suffered or losses \r\nsustained. The goal is to restore the injured party, as nearly as possible through the \r\npayment of money, to the same position he or she was in before the wrongful \r\ninjury occurred. Barnwell v.Barber-Colman CO., 301 S.C. 534, 537, 393 \r\nS.E.2d 162, 163 (1989); Laird v.Nationwide Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 396, \r\n134 S.E.2d 206, 210 (1964); Carrigg v.Blue, 283 S.C. 494, 499, 323 S.E.2d 787, \r\n790 (Ct. App. 1984); F.P. Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts \r\n535-36 (1997).\r\n\r\nThe purposes of punitive damages are to punish \r\nthe wrongdoer and deter the wrongdoer and others from engaging in \r\nsimilar reckless, willful, wanton, or malicious conduct in the future. \r\nBarnwell, supra. Punitive damages also serve to vindicate a private right of the \r\ninjured party by requiring the wrongdoer to pay money to the injured party. \r\nHarris v. Burnside, 261 S.C. 190, 196, 199 S.E.2d 65, 68 (1973); Hubbard &amp; Felix, supra, at 581-93. This Court has explained the important role that punitive \r\ndamages play in the American system of justice generally, and in South \r\nCarolina in particular since at least 1784.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Exemplary or punitive damages go to the \r\n    plaintiff, not as a fine or penalty for a public wrong, but \r\n    in vindication of a private right which has been \r\n    willfully invaded; and indeed, it may be said that such \r\n    damages in a measure compensate or satisfy for the \r\n    willfulness with which the private right was invaded, but, \r\n    in addition thereto, operating as a deterring \r\n    punishment to the wrongdoer, and as a warning to others \r\n    .... Punitive damages have now come, however, to \r\n    be generally, though not universally, regarded, not \r\n    only as punishment for wrong, but as vindication of \r\n    private right. This is the basis upon which they are \r\n    now placed in this state.\r\n\r\n\r\nRogers v. Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. \r\n567, 573, 106 S.E.2d 258, 261(1958) (citations omitted); accord Hicks v. \r\nHerring, 246 S.C. 429, 437-38, 144 S.E.2d 151,155 (1965); Mock v. Atlantic Coast Line \r\nR. Co., 227 S.C. 245, 267, 87 S.E.2d 830, 840 (1955); Davenport v. Woodside Cotton \r\nMills Co., 225 S.C. 52, 60, 80 S.E.2d 740, 743 (1954); Watts v. Railroad \r\nCo., 60 S.C. 67, 73, 38 S.E. 240, 242 (1901).\r\n\r\nCases mentioning the compensatory aspect of \r\npunitive damages provide little support for \r\n    Cantrell's position. All merely illustrate the \r\nobvious truth that punitive damages serve at least three \r\nimportant purposes: punishment of the defendant's reckless, willful, \r\nwanton, or malicious conduct; deterrence of similar future conduct by the \r\ndefendant or others; and compensation for the reckless or willful \r\ninvasion of the plaintiff s private rights. While there is a compensatory aspect to punitive \r\ndamages, we find unpersuasive Cantrell's attempt to blur all \r\ndistinctions between actual and punitive damages by unduly emphasizing that \r\ncompensatory aspect.\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appeals' holding on this \r\nissue for four related reasons. First, allowing the defendant \r\nto shift a portion of the cost of a punitive award back to the plaintiff through \r\ncomparative negligence would reduce the punishment and deterrent effect of \r\nthe award. The defendant's punishment would be lessened simply because the \r\nplaintiff was somewhat negligent. That is illogical and violates the \r\nunderlying rationale of punitive damages.\r\nAs the Court of Appeals explained in this case, \r\nthe overwhelming majority of other jurisdictions considering this \r\nissue have concluded that an award of punitive damages is not reduced under \r\ncomparative negligence. Courts uniformly have held that allowing such a \r\nreduction would nullify the punishment and deterrence goals underlying \r\npunitive damages. Clark, 332 S.C. at 442 n.5, 504 S.E.2d at 610 n.5 (listing \r\ncases). In Anderson v. Trent, 685 S.W.2d 712 (Tex. Ct. App. 1984), the court \r\nreasoned that\r\n\r\n  if exemplary damages were only for \r\n      compensating the plaintiff, then an argument could be made that \r\n      they should be reduced by the percentage of the \r\n-plaintiffs comparative negligence. However, the \r\nparamount purpose for awarding exemplary damages is not \r\nto compensate the plaintiff, but to punish and set \r\nan example for others. Consequently, it is \r\nincorrect to view the award of exemplary damages from the \r\neyes of the recovering plaintiff; rather, the award \r\nshould be viewed from the eyes of public \r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 714 (emphasis in original) (citations \r\nomitted). In the only case which has allowed a reduction in punitive damages under \r\ncomparative negligence, the court did so in part because it concluded \r\nMichigan law allows punitive damages only to compensate the plaintiff for injured \r\nfeelings, not to punish and deter wrongdoers. Parr v. Central Soya Co., 732 \r\nF. Supp. 738, 742-44 (E.D. Mich. 1990).\r\n\r\nSecond, any reduction in the defendant's \r\npunishment inflicts a corresponding amount of punishment on the \r\nplaintiff. Shifting a portion of the cost of the punitive award back to the plaintiff \r\nessentially would punish him or her along with the defendant. In this case, \r\nAnderson would be punished by the loss of $4,000 (sixteen percent of $25,000 in \r\npunitive damages), money which the jury believed she rightly deserved. Yet \r\nAnderson in no way contributed to the willful or reckless nature of the \r\ndefendant's conduct, and did nothing for which she should be punished.\r\nThird, it would be inappropriate to reduce the \r\npunitive damages by comparing the plaintiffs negligence with \r\nthe defendant's reckless or willful conduct. It is proper to reduce Anderson's \r\nactual damages in this case because the jury decided her negligent decision to turn \r\nleft in front of Cantrell's speeding car contributed to causing the \r\naccident. But Anderson's negligent conduct was not willful or reckless. Conduct \r\nthat is merely negligent should not be used to reduce damages the jury decided \r\nCantrell should pay as a means of punishing her willful and reckless conduct, and \r\ndeterring similar conduct by her and others in the future.\r\nFourth, when considering the negligence \r\nattributable to each party, the focus is on the actions of both plaintiff \r\nand defendant. What did each do, or not do, that contributed to the cause of an \r\ninjury? With punitive damages, however, the focus is on only the defendant. The \r\ncentral inquiry is whether the defendant's conduct was so reckless, willful, \r\nwanton, or malicious that the defendant should be punished and deterred by \r\nrequiring him or her to pay money to the plaintiff. See Gamble v. \r\nStevenson, 305 S.C. 104,110, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991) (listing factors focusing on \r\ndefendant that court must consider in post-trial review of punitive \r\naward).\r\nCantrell also argues that the Court of Appeals \r\nerred because Anderson did not present clear and convincing \r\nevidence of Cantrell's reckless, willful, wanton, or malicious conduct. We \r\nconclude the Court of Appeals correctly reasoned that Cantrell's excessive \r\nspeed, her disregard for the commercial nature of the highway, her lack of \r\nremorse, and her frivolous reason for speeding amply support the award of \r\npunitive damages.\r\n\r\nIn sum, we hold that punitive damages are not \r\nreduced by the proportion of the plaintiff s negligence under \r\ncomparative negligence. We also affirm the award of punitive damages to Anderson \r\nand Clark.\r\n2. COMPUTER-GENERATED VIDEO \r\nANIMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nCantrell contends the Court of Appeals erred in \r\naffirming the trial judge's refusal to admit her computer-generated \r\nvideo animation purporting to show how the accident occurred as demonstrative \r\nevidence. We disagree.\r\nCantrell wanted to introduce a video containing \r\na computer-generated animation of the accident \r\nthrough her expert witness. Anderson objected, asserting the video did not \r\naccurately reflect the testimony of the witnesses or the experts who had \r\nreconstructed the accident. Specifically, the video animation did not accurately reflect \r\nthe initial position of Anderson's car as described by Cantrell in her testimony. A \r\nportion of the animation also made it appear that Anderson's car pulled \r\ndirectly in front of Cantrell's car when Cantrell was almost upon it, which \r\nconflicted with the testimony of both parties' expert witnesses.\r\nThe trial judge refused to admit the video \r\nanimation as demonstrative evidence because it was \r\ninconsistent with prior testimony, including that of Cantrell's expert witness, and \r\nit inaccurately reflected the evidence. Those deficiencies meant it would \r\nmislead and confuse the jury, the judge ruled.\r\n\r\nWe have not previously addressed the \r\nadmissibility of computer generated video animations as demonstrative \r\n  evidence.2 Cantrell does not object to the basic analysis used by the Court \r\nof Appeals, although she disagrees with the result reached in her case. We adopt \r\nthe following analysis, modified slightly from that set out by the Court of \r\nAppeals.\r\n\r\nDemonstrative evidence includes items such as a \r\nphotograph, chart, diagram, or video animation that explains or \r\nsummarizes other evidence and testimony. Such evidence has secondary relevance \r\nto the issues at hand; it is not directly relevant, but must rely on other \r\nmaterial testimony for relevance. Demonstrative evidence indistinguishable from \r\nexhibits that comprise \"real\" or substantive evidence, such as the actual murder \r\nweapon or a written document containing allegedly defamatory \r\nstatements.\r\nThese categories sometimes overlap. For example, \r\na bank surveillance photograph of a robbery suspect may be \r\nclassified as demonstrative evidence because it illustrates the crime scene; however, \r\nit also may be classified as substantive evidence of the identity of the \r\nperpetrator. See Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, Evidence, Â§Â§ 9.31-9.36 (1999) (discussing \r\nvarious definitions and types of demonstrative evidence).\r\nDemonstrative evidence often is admitted only \r\nfor use in the courtroom to explain and illustrate a witness's \r\ntestimony, but it also may be admissible as an exhibit for the jury to examine \r\nand consider during deliberations. E.g., State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 \r\nS.E.2d 63, 76 (1998) (photographs and diagram of crime scene properly admitted in \r\nevidence); Holmes v. Black River Elec. Co-op., Inc., 274 S.C. 252, 258, \r\n262 S.E.2d 875, 878 (1980) (photographs of plaintiffs injured arm properly admitted in \r\nevidence); State v. Barrs, 257 S.C. 193, 199, 184 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1971) \r\n(upholding admission of coil of copper wire that was like \r\nthe one allegedly stolen by defendants as proper demonstrative evidence); \r\nMueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, supra, Â§ 9.31.\r\n\r\nAttempts to use computer-generated video \r\nanimations at trial, although not an everyday occurrence, are \r\nincreasing. Computer animation is likely to become more prevalent, especially as \r\nthe price of preparing such animations falls. G. Ross Anderson, Jr., \r\nComputer Animation: Admissibility and Uses, South Carolina Trial Lawyer \r\nBulletin 9 (Fall 1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Computer animation allows attorneys to \r\n    convert witnesses' verbal testimony into dynamic, \r\n    visual demonstrations capable of mentally transporting \r\n    jurors to the scene .... However, a computer animation \r\n    can mislead a jury just as easily as it can educate \r\n    them. An animation is only as good as the \r\n    underlying testimony, physical data, and engineering \r\n    assumptions that drive its images. The computer maxim \"garbage in, garbage out\" applies to computer \r\n    animations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson, supra, at 9. As the Louisiana \r\n  Supreme Court further explains, \r\n\r\n\r\n  The extreme vividness and persuasiveness of \r\n      motion pictures . . . is a two-edged sword. If the film \r\n      does not portray original facts in controversy, but \r\n      rather represents a staged reproduction of one party's \r\n      version of those facts, the danger that the jury may \r\n      confuse art with reality is particularly great. Further, the \r\n      vivid impressions on the trier of fact created by the \r\n      viewing of the motion pictures will be particularly \r\n      difficult to limit or, if the film is subsequently deemed  \r\n      to be inadmissible, to expunge by judicial \r\n      instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Trahan, 576 So.2d 1, 8 (1990) \r\n  (quoting McCormick on Evidence, Â§ 214 (2d ed. 1972). Likewise, our Court of Appeals \r\n  correctly highlighted several concerns about computer animations: the \r\n  potential to mislead by an inaccurate, portrayal of the facts, the potential to create \r\n  lasting impressions that unduly override other testimony or evidence, and the \r\n  need for heightened guarantees of trustworthiness due to the possibility of \r\n  editorial distortion by the party preparing the animation. Clark, 332 S.C. at 445-46, 504 S.E.2d at \r\n612.\r\n\r\nDespite the dangers, computer animations can \r\nserve worthwhile purposes if screened carefully and admitted \r\ncautiously. We hold that a computer-generated video animation is admissible \r\nas demonstrative evidence when the proponent shows that the animation is \r\n(1) authentic under Rule 901, SORE; (2) relevant under Rules 401 and 402, \r\nSORE; (3) a fair and accurate representation of the evidence to which it \r\nrelates, and (4) its probative value substantially outweighs the danger of unfair \r\nprejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury under Rule 403, SORE. See \r\nAnderson, supra, at 9; Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, supra, Â§ 9.34; Gregory \r\nP. Joseph, A Simplified Approach to Computer-Generated Evidence and \r\nAnimations, 156 F.R.D. 327 (1994) (all suggesting ways to analyze admission of computer \r\nanimations).\r\nTo ensure that the opposing party has sufficient \r\ntime to analyze the animation, the trial court also should consider \r\nwhether the proponent disclosed the animation and underlying data within a \r\nreasonable period of time before trial. Cf. Ramos v. Hawley, 316 S.C. 534, \r\n536, 451 S.E.2d 27, 28 (Ct. App. 1994) (\" [p] roper trial procedure for the \r\nintroduction of evidence requires that opposing counsel be given a reasonable opportunity to \r\ninspect the proposed evidence before it is accepted by the court. This \r\nopportunity allows counsel to determine whether an objection is proper.\"); see also \r\nRichardson v. State Highway &amp; Transp. Comm'n, 863 S.W. 2d 876 (Mo. \r\n1993) (upholding trial judge's refusal to admit computer simulation where party did not \r\ngive notice of it to opponent until last business day before trial, hindering \r\nopponent's ability to challenge its admission or cross-examine experts who prepared \r\nit); Anderson, supra, at 11 (suggesting animation and underlying data should \r\nbe disclosed at least two weeks before trial). Untimely disclosure should \r\nnot, standing alone, necessarily result in exclusion of the animation. But late \r\ndisclosure may prevent the opposing party from adequately attempting to \r\nexplain why the animation is not a fair and accurate representation which, in \r\nturn, may prompt the court to conclude its probative value does not \r\nsubstantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice.\r\n\r\nWe also encourage the trial court to give a \r\ncautionary instruction that the animation represents only a re-creation \r\nof the proponent's version of the event; it should in no way be viewed as the \r\nabsolute truth; and, like all evidence, it may be accepted or rejected in \r\nwhole or in part. The court may wish to call attention to any assumptions upon which \r\nthe animation is based, as well as any other particular facts that warrant a \r\ncautionary instruction. See Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, supra, Â§ 9.34; \r\nFulcher, supra, at 75-76.\r\n\r\nFinally, the trial court, as with other evidence \r\nand testimony, has broad discretion in whether to admit a computer \r\nanimation, and its decision will be overturned only for an abuse of discretion. \r\nSee Holmes v. Black River Elec. Co-op., Inc., 274 S.C. at 258, 262 S.E.2d \r\nat 878; Brown v. Orndorff, 309 S.C. 320, 324-25, 422 S.E.2d 151, 153-54 (Ct. \r\nApp.1992).\r\nUnder the above analysis, we conclude the Court \r\nof Appeals properly affirmed the trial court's refusal to \r\nadmit the video animation in this case.\r\n\"The requirement of authentication or \r\nidentification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by \r\nevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its \r\nproponent claims.\" Rule 901(a), SORE. Thus, a party may authenticate a video animation \r\nby offering testimony from a witness familiar with the preparation of the \r\nanimation and the data on which it is based. In this case, the animation was \r\nauthenticated by the testimony of the expert who prepared the underlying data and \r\nthe computer technician who used that data to create it.\r\n\r\nNext, an animation is relevant when it has a \r\ndirect bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less \r\nprobable the matter in controversy. Rules 401-402, SORE; State v. Alexander, \r\n303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991). An animation may be relevant when it relates to \r\nother admissible, material evidence and it will aid the trier of fact in \r\nunderstanding the related evidence. Anderson, supra, at 10. In this case, the \r\nanimation was relevant because it was related to the testimony of several witnesses \r\nabout the accident. It would have aided the jury in understanding that testimony, \r\nprovided it did not have to be excluded on other grounds.\r\n\r\nNext, the animation must be a fair and accurate \r\nrepresentation of the evidence to which it relates. It need not be \r\nexact in every detail, but the important elements must be identical or very \r\nsimilar to the scene as described in other testimony and evidence presented by the \r\nanimation's proponent in order to constitute a fair and accurate \r\nrepresentation. In an animation reconstructing a vehicle accident, for instance, \r\nthe animation must be technically correct on details such as distance, \r\nterrain, relative speed, path of travel, and surroundings. The fact the animation \r\nis inconsistent with testimony or evidence presented by the opposing \r\nparty should not necessarily lead to its exclusion, provided it fairly and \r\naccurately portrays the proponent's version of events. E~., Hinkle v. City \r\nof Clarksburg, W. Va., 81 F.3d 416, 424 25 (4th Cir.1996) (explaining that a \r\ncomputer-animated videotape is essentially like a real-life re-creation. and thus it must \r\nbe sufficiently close to actual facts); Hutchinson v. American Family Mut. Ins. \r\nCo., 514 N.W.2d 882, 890 (Iowa 1994) (upholding trial court's refusal to admit \r\nanimation generally illustrating how a closed-head injury occurs because it was \r\nnot based upon particular facts of plaintiffs case and witness was not familiar \r\nwith specific speeds and forces in the case); Sommervold v. Grevlos, 518 \r\nN.W.2d 733, 738 (S.D. 1994) (upholding trial court's refusal to admit \r\nanimation of colliding bicycles because speed of bicycles, street lights, and location \r\nof accident did not match witnesses' testimony); Trahan, 576 So.2d at 8 \r\n(upholding trial court's refusal to admit videotape reconstruction of crime scene it did \r\nnot depict parties in an identical or similar manner to the incident as testified \r\nto by defendant); Anderson, supra, at 10-12.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the trial judge properly excluded \r\nthe animation because it did not accurately reflect the \r\ntestimony of the proponent and her expert witness. The animation did not accurately \r\nreflect the initial position of Anderson's car as Cantrell described it in her \r\ntestimony. A portion of the animation also made it appear that Anderson's \r\ncar pulled directly in front of Cantrell's car when Cantrell was almost upon it. \r\nCantrell's expert witness, however, testified Cantrell could have first \r\nseen Anderson's car some distance back from the point where Cantrell's car \r\ninitially was positioned in the animation.\r\nFinally, the probative value of the animation \r\nmust substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice, \r\nconfusing the issues, or misleading the jury under Rule 403, SORE. See Fulcher, \r\nsupra, at 70 (explaining this factor often is a \"formidable obstacle\" due to the \r\nrelatively recent advent of computer animation, although such fears are diminishing \r\nas judges and the public become more familiar with computer technology). In this \r\ncase, the probative value of the animation did not substantially outweigh the \r\ndanger of unfair prejudice and misleading the jury due to the inaccuracies it \r\ncontained.\r\nAccordingly, we hold the trial judge did not \r\nabuse his discretion in refusing to admit the computer animation as \r\ndemonstrative evidence, and the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed that \r\nruling.\r\n\r\n3. EXCESSIVE SPEED \r\nCHARGE\r\n\r\n\r\nCantrell argues the Court of Appeals erred in \r\naffirming the trial judge's refusal to give her requested charge \r\nregarding excessive speed. We disagree.\r\nThe trial judge refused to give the following \r\ncharge requested by Cantrell:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is without legal significance that speed was \r\n    a contributing factor in placing the vehicle at \r\n    a particular location on the favored road when \r\n  the emergency arose, since [the] driver of such \r\n  vehicle had the legal right to occupy that portion of the \r\n  road.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding the \r\n  trial court correctly refused to find as a matter of law that the accident was \r\n  inevitable. Clark, 332 S.C. at 444, 504 S.E.2d at 611.\r\nCantrell asserts the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  because the instruction correctly stated a principle of law that applied \r\n  in her case. Cantrell relies primarily on Horton v. Greyhound, 241 \r\n  S.C. 430, 128 S.E.2d 776 (1962).\r\nIn Horton, a Greyhound bus that was \r\n  exceeding the posted speed limit collided with an oncoming pickup truck \r\n  when the truck suddenly swerved into the bus's lane in order to pass another \r\n  vehicle that had stopped to make a lefthand turn. The collision killed the pickup's \r\n  driver and passenger. The passenger's estate filed an action against the \r\n  bus company and its driver.\r\nThis Court affirmed a directed verdict for the \r\n  defendants. The Court reasoned the collision was inevitable \r\n  because, even if the bus could have stopped short of the collision point, it likely \r\n  would have occurred anyway. Although there was evidence of negligence \r\n  (speeding) by the defendant, it was one of the rare cases in which that evidence was \r\n  insufficient to raise a jury question on whether the defendant's speed caused \r\n  the accident. Horton, 241 S.C. at 441, 128 S.E.2d at 782. The Court has \r\n  reached a similar conclusion in other cases.3\r\n\r\nWe recently made it clear that a judgment as a \r\nmatter of law pursuant to Horton and its progeny is \r\nproper only in the exceedingly rare case when the evidence, viewed in the light most \r\nfavorable to the non-moving party, shows that the speed of a vehicle could not have \r\ncontributed to the cause of the accident. \"Of course, in most automobile \r\naccident cases, speed creates imponderable issues of time and distance which \r\nmust be resolved by the jury.\" Tubbs by Duren v. Bowie, 308 S.C. 155, \r\n158, 417 S.E.2d 550, 552 (1992) (quoting Blanding v. Hammell, \r\nsupra).\r\nIn explaining its decision, the Horton \r\nCourt stated the fact that \"speed was a contributing factor in placing the \r\nbus at a particular location on the highway when the emergency arose is without \r\nlegal significance, because the [bus] had the legal right to occupy that \r\nportion of the highway.\" Horton, 241 S.C. at 439, 128 S.E.2d at 781. It is from \r\nthis language that Cantrell drew her request for a jury charge.\r\n\r\nAll of the above cases involve the propriety of \r\na judgment as a matter of law based on Horton. Cantrell's \r\nargument, however, focuses upon the propriety of a jury instruction drawn from \r\nHorton.\r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial \r\ncourt's decision regarding jury instructions unless the trial \r\ncourt abused its discretion. Dalon v. Golden Lanes, Inc., 320 S.C. 534, 541, \r\n466 S.E.2d 368, 372 (Ct. App. 1996); Smith v. Ridgeway Chemicals, Inc., 302 \r\nS.C. 303, 307, 395 S.E.2d 742, 744 (Ct. App. 1990). An abuse of discretion occurs when \r\nthe trial court's ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual \r\nconclusions, is without evidentiary support. Fontaine v. Peitz, \r\n291 S.C. 536, 354 S.E.2d 565 (1987).\r\nWhen instructing the jury, the trial court is \r\nrequired to charge only principles of law that apply to the issues \r\nraised in the pleadings and developed by the evidence in support of those issues. \r\nTucker v. Reynolds, 268 S.C. 330, 335, 233 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1977). Furthermore, \r\nthe trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South \r\nCarolina. McCourt by McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, \r\n457 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1995).\r\nIt is error for the trial court to refuse to \r\ngive a requested instruction which states a sound principle of law when that \r\nprinciple applies to the case at hand, and the principle is not otherwise \r\nincluded in the charge. Sanders v. Western Auto Supply Co., 256 S.C. 490, \r\n497, 183 S.E.2d 321, 325 (1971). However, the trial court is not required to \r\ninstruct the jury on a principle of law that is irrelevant to the case as proved. \r\nGreenville Housing Authority of City of Greenville by Carlton v. Massey, 281 \r\nS.C. 618, 622, 316 S.E.2d 722, 724 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Clarke v. Swearingen, \r\n6 S.C. 291(1875)). Moreover, even if the trial court erred in failing to give a \r\nrequested instruction, the requesting party also must show that the error was \r\nprejudicial to warrant reversal on appeal. Miller v. City of West Columbia, \r\n322 S.C. 224, 471 S.E.2d 683 (1996); McCourt, 318 S.C. at 306, 457 S.E.2d at \r\n606.\r\nWe conclude that Cantrell's proposed instruction \r\nwas improper and irrelevant in this case because the speed of her \r\nvehicle plainly was of legal significance in deciding the cause of the \r\naccident. The trial judge properly denied Cantrell's requested instruction, as well \r\nas her directed verdict motion. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable \r\nto Anderson, it was for the jury to decide whether the accident was caused by \r\nCantrell's speed, Anderson's decision to turn left in front of Cantrell's \r\noncoming vehicle, or the acts of both drivers. The Horton line of cases is \r\ninapplicable.\r\n\r\nWe never have indicated that a Horton \r\ncharge such as the one requested by Cantrell is necessary or \r\nappropriate. In fact, we doubt Cantrell's proposed instruction could ever be presented as \r\na sound principle of law to a jury in any collision case. Cantrell essentially \r\nasked the judge to tell the jury that, as a matter of law, it did not matter \r\nwhether she was speeding because her speed could not have caused the accident. A \r\njudge who instructed the jury in that fashion would be deciding the very issue \r\npresented to the jury - whether a litigant's negligent speeding was the legal \r\nand proximate cause of an accident. In addition, a judge under our comparative \r\nnegligence system would be telling the jury to ignore a party's speeding when \r\nresolving the proportion of fault attributable to each party. Such a charge would \r\nbe improper for both reasons.\r\nIn the exceedingly rare case when \"it is without \r\nlegal significance that speed was a contributing factor\" in a \r\ncollision, and the record contains no evidence of other negligent or wrongful acts by \r\nthe speeding driver, the judge may grant a litigant's directed verdict motion \r\nunder Horton and its progeny. There would be nothing for the jury to resolve \r\nbecause, as a matter of law, any excessive speeding could not have caused the \r\naccident.\r\nAccordingly, we hold the Court of Appeals \r\nproperly affirmed the trial judge's rejection of Cantrell's proposed \r\ninstruction.\r\n4. SUDDEN EMERGENCY CHARGE\r\n\r\n\r\nCantrell contends the Court of Appeals erred in \r\naffirming the trial judge's refusal to instruct the jury on the \r\ndoctrine of sudden emergency. She asserts the charge was required in order for the \r\njury to understand the emergency in which Cantrell found herself when \r\nAnderson's vehicle turned left in front of hers. We disagree.\r\n\"When the driver of an automobile is confronted \r\nwith a sudden emergency brought about by the negligence of \r\nanother and not by his own negligence, and [is] compelled to act \r\ninstantly to avoid a collision or an injury, [that driver] is not guilty of negligence if he \r\nmakes such a choice as a person of ordinary prudence placed in a like position \r\nmight make, even though he did not make the wisest choice.\" Still v. Blake, \r\n255 S.C. 95, 105, 177 S.E.2d 469, 474 (1970) (emphasis added) (concluding sudden \r\nemergency doctrine properly was charged to jury where plaintiff veered left to \r\navoid colliding with defendant's vehicle, which had signaled to turn right but \r\nunexpectedly turned left); accord Spahn v. Town of Port Rote, 326 S.C. 632, \r\n486 S.E.2d 507 (Ct. App. 1997) (concluding sudden emergency doctrine properly \r\nwas charged to jury where police officer's vehicle injured plaintiff as \r\nplaintiff was trying to retrieve his boat from middle of road), aff d as modified by \r\nSpahn v. Town of Port Roil, 330 S.C. 168, 499 S.E.2d 205 (1998); Singletary v. \r\nSouth Carolina Dep't of Educ., 316 S.C. 153, 447 S.E.2d 231(Ct. App. 1994) \r\n(concluding it was a jury question on whether defendant school bus driver acted \r\nprudently under sudden emergency doctrine when driver failed to pull off foggy \r\nhighway after bus stalled, and was struck from rear by plaintiff s \r\nvehicle).\r\n\r\nThe sudden emergency doctrine is intended to \r\nprotect a driver who, while acting with due care, suddenly finds \r\nherself in an emergency situation due to the negligent or wrongful acts of \r\nanother. The doctrine does not apply when a party's own negligence creates the very \r\nemergency in which she finds herself.\r\nIn this case, Cantrell's allegedly excessive \r\nspeed created the emergency. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals \r\ncorrectly affirmed the trial judge's refusal to instruct the jury on the \r\nsudden emergency doctrine.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold that punitive damages, unlike actual \r\ndamages, are not reduced in comparative negligence. We hold that \r\ncomputer-generated video animations are admissible in appropriate \r\ncircumstances. We hold that the trial judge correctly rejected the proposed jury \r\ninstructions on excessive speed and the sudden emergency doctrine. We affirm the \r\nCourt of Appeals' rulings on all these issues, although we modify the analysis \r\nused to determine the admissibility of video animations. We find \r\nCantrell's remaining arguments on other evidentiary matters unpersuasive and \r\naffirm the Court of Appeals' rulings on those issues.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., \r\nconcur.\r\n1 Clark owned the car Anderson was driving, but was not in the car when the accident occurred. Although both were plaintiffs, we will refer only to Anderson for simplicity's sake.\r\n2 We address this computer animation as demonstrative evidence, not as substantive or scientific evidence. See Clark, 332 S.C. at 448 n.8, 504 S.E.2d at 613 n.8 (finding that admission of computer animation as scientific evidence under precedent of United States Supreme Court needlessly complicates the matter by confusing the methodology of producing demonstrative evidence with its end result) (citing G. Ross Anderson, Jr., Computer Animation: Admissibility and Uses, South Carolina Trial Lawyer Bulletin 9,10 (Fall 1995)).\r\nCourts and commentators distinguish a computer animation and a computer simulation. An animation is used to illustrate a witness's testimony by recreating a scene or process, and properly is viewed as demonstrative evidence. A simulation is based on scientific or physical principles and data entered into a computer, which is programmed to analyze the data and draw a conclusion from it. Courts require proof of the validity of the scientific principles and data before admitting a simulation as evidence. See Kristin L.

Domin, of Clawson &amp; Staubes, of Charleston, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' opinion in Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 331 S.C. 192, 500 S.E.2d 160 (Ct. App. 1998). We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent Vernon Staubes owns a two-story rental apartment building in Folly Beach. The property was damaged in 1989 by Hurricane Hugo. Staubes obtained a permit to repair his building from petitioner, the City of Folly Beach (the City). In Folly Beach, if the cost to repair a property's damage exceeded fifty percent of the property's market value before the damage, then repairs were not allowed unless new construction requirements were met. After an inspection by an engineer who found that the building's structural damage exceeded fifty percent of its value, the City revoked the permit and issued a condemnation order. Although Staubes obtained another permit from the County of Charleston, this permit was also revoked when the County discovered the City's revocation of the first permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStaubes appealed the revocation of the building permit to the City's Zoning Board and to the circuit court, but the City's decision was affirmed. The Court of Appeals, however, held that the City had abused its discretion by revoking the permit. The Court of Appeals found that the Zoning Board had based its decision on the structural damage of the building rather than the cost of repair. Further, because Staubes had presented three estimates that the cost of repair was less than fifty percent of the building's pre-Hugo market value, the Court of Appeals decided that the City should not have revoked the permit. Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, Op. No. 94-UP-138 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 27, 1994), cert. dismissed as improvidently anted, Op. No. 95-MO-209 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 14, 1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this Court dismissed certiorari, Staubes filed the instant litigation against the City. Staubes alleged in his complaint that the City \"improperly and without justification\" revoked his permit and that the Zoning Board had acted beyond its authority in upholding the City's decision. Staubes alleged that the City's actions resulted in a temporary unconstitutional taking of his property and he sought damages for the loss of use of the property. In its answer, the City denied the substantive allegations and raised affirmative defenses, including that Staubes' claim was barred and/or limited by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment. At the motions hearing, Staubes argued first and discussed the issue of temporary taking. The City then argued in response, but interspersed with its constitutional arguments, the City argued that Staubes was trying to bring a negligence claim against the City based on the actions of the Zoning Board. The City asserted to the trial court that Staubes could not bring a negligence action because it would be barred under the Tort Claims Act.\r\nStaubes acknowledged that in his complaint he pled his claim as a taking action, but he requested leave to amend the complaint to add a negligence claim. The City objected to Staubes' motion to amend. The trial court did not respond specifically to either Staubes' request to amend or the City's objection to amendment. However, in its order granting summary judgment for the City, the trial court addressed the negligence claim.2 The trial court stated that \"[a]s a practical matter what Plaintiff is claiming is a negligence cause of action against Folly Beach. The problem with this claim is that it is barred by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.\" The trial court listed four applicable exceptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity and concluded it could not allow a negligence cause of action which was \"so clearly barred\" by the Tort Claims Act.3\r\nStaubes appealed. In addition to his arguments on the constitutional issues, Staubes argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim for negligence. Specifically, Staubes argued that under the licensing powers exception, he could maintain a negligence claim if he proved gross negligence. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(12) (Supp. 1999). In its brief to the Court of Appeals, the City contended that the trial court \"correctly saw [Staubes'] claim for what it was - a negligence claim against Folly Beach,\" and that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment.\r\nAlthough the Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment on the taking and due process issues, the Court of Appeals found that there were material issues of fact surrounding whether the City was grossly negligent in revoking the building permit. Thus, the Court of Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment on the negligence claim. The Court of Appeals did not address the fact that negligence had not been specifically pled in the complaint.\r\n\r\nIn its petition for rehearing, the City argued - for the first time - that a negligence claim was not pled by Staubes and was not ruled upon by the trial court, and therefore, the Court of Appeals should not have addressed the negligence issue. The City also argued that certain exceptions under the Tort Claims Act rendered the City immune from liability. The Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing, and the City now raises the same arguments to this Court.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n      Did the Court of Appeals err in addressing the negligence claim because it was not preserved for appellate review?\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n      Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing summary judgment on the negligence claim under a \"gross negligence\" exception to the Tort Claims Act when other applicable exceptions appear to provide absolute immunity?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n1. Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review\r\nThe City contends that Staubes did not plead a negligence cause of action in his complaint and the trial court did not rule on Staubes' motion to amend the complaint. Thus, the City maintains that the negligence claim was not properly preserved for appellate review and the Court of Appeals erred in addressing this issue.\r\n\r\nIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review. E.g., Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Dept, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571(1997). Error preservation requirements are intended \"to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.\" I'On v. Town of Mt.Pleasant, Op. No. 25048 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No: 2 at 1, 15); see also State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 5 n.6, 501 S.E.2d 716, 718 n.6 (1998) (\"the ultimate goal behind preservation of error rules is to insure that an issue raised on appeal has first been addressed to and ruled on by the trial court.\"); 4 C.J.S. Appeal and Error Â§ 213 (1993) (\"At the very least, the matter must have definitely been called to the attention of the trial court sufficiently to obtain a ruling thereon.\"). Without an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed error.\r\n\r\nThe issue in the instant case is whether a negligence claim was effectively raised and ruled upon for purposes of summary judgment. If so, then the Court of Appeals did not err in addressing this issue. The City argues that because the negligence claim was not pled it was not raised to the trial court. Moreover, the City contends that the trial court never ruled on a negligence claim. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe note initially that negligence was not expressly pled in the complaint. However, this does not establish that it was not raised to the trial court. Indeed, the negligence claim was definitely raised to the trial court at the summary judgment hearing, and significantly, the City itself first raised the issue. After the City suggested that Staubes was actually bringing a negligence claim, the parties and the trial court treated the motion for summary judgment as one involving both a taking claim and a negligence claim. Therefore, we believe that the existence of a negligence claim was clearly raised to the trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the order granting summary judgment, the trial court explicitly addressed \"a negligence cause of action against Folly Beach.\" Finding such an action barred by the Tort Claims Act, the trial court granted summary judgment on this claim. Consequently, the trial court ruled on the negligence claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the City argues that this issue is unpreserved because the trial court did not rule on Staubes' motion to amend his complaint. The City also contends that it was incumbent upon Staubes to request a ruling on the motion to amend in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend a judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmendments of pleadings are controlled by Rule 15, S CROP. Under this.rule, a party may amend his pleading by leave of court and \"leave shall be freely given when justice so requires and does not prejudice any other party.\" Rule 15(a), SCRCP. The prejudice envisioned by Rule 15 is a lack of notice that the new issue is going to be tried, and a lack of opportunity to refute it. Pool v. Pool, 329 S.C. 324, 328-29, 494 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1998). Moreover, when issues are not raised by the pleadings but are \"tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\", Rule 15(b), SCRCP. Thus, amendments of pleadings are allowed \"even after judgment\" to conform to the evidence presented at trial. Id.; see also Kelly v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 319, 323, 450 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"Amendments to conform to the proof should be liberally allowed when no prejudice to the opposing party will result.\").\r\nThere was no express ruling on Staubes' motion to amend. Nevertheless, by granting the motion for summary judgment on the negligence cause of action, the trial court obviously treated the complaint as if it had been amended. At the summary judgment hearing, the City was given full opportunity to argue on the negligence claim and effectively \"answered\" Staubes' allegations by asserting the Tort Claims Act as an affirmative defense. The City's arguments establish that it impliedly consented to the presentation of a negligence claim for purposes of summary judgment. Thus, based on the arguments raised by both parties at the summary judgment hearing, the trial court properly treated the negligence claim as if it had been raised in the pleadings. Cf. Rule 15(b), SCRCP (issues not raised by the pleadings but tried by consent of the parties shall be treated as if they had been raised in the pleadings).\r\nFurthermore, we note that the City itself raised this issue by asserting that Staubes' claim was actually a negligence action.4 Given this fact, the City cannot maintain that there was a lack of notice or a lack of opportunity to refute the negligence claim. Pool v. Pool, supra. Put simply, the City's own actions at the summary judgment hearing preclude any argument on appeal that it has been prejudiced by treating the pleadings as amended. See Ex parte McMillan, 319 S.C. 331, 461 S.E.2d 43 (1995) (by conceding at trial that the complaint was, in part, under the Tort Claims Act, the party could not argue on appeal that the case was not under the Tort Claims Act); see also State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134,152 n.11, 508 S.E.2d 857, 866 n.11(1998) (a party may not complain about an error induced by the party's own conduct); State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 511; 316 S.E.2d 395, 397 (1984) (same).\r\n\r\nAs to the City's argument that Staubes should have requested a specific ruling on his motion to amend, we find that a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion was not warranted under the circumstances of this case. First, as discussed above, the summary judgment order reflected that the trial court effectively treated the pleadings as amended. Second, Staubes knew from the order that the trial court had decided to grant summary judgment for the City on any negligence claim he might raise. Thus, requesting permission to add a negligence claim to his complaint would have been futile. This Court does not require parties to engage in futile actions in order to preserve issues for appellate review. See, e.g., State v. Bryant, 316 S.C. 216, 220, 447 S.E.2d 852, 855 (1994) (where the Court found that it would have been futile to move to strike testimony which the trial court had already ruled was proper); State v. Ross, 272 S.C. 56, 60-61, 249 S.E.2d 159, 162 (1978) (once the court rules on an objection, counsel need not repeat the objection after each question).\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the negligence claim was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, and therefore, the Court of Appeals did not err in addressing the negligence claim. We emphasize, however, that it would have been more appropriate for the trial court to have expressly ruled on the motion to amend and allowed amendment of the pleadings before ruling on the negligence claim. On remand, the pleadings shall be amended as necessary to conform to the fact that the negligence claim was raised at the summary judgment hearing. Kelly v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., supra.\r\n2. Reversal of Summary Judgment\r\nThe City also argues that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing summary judgment on the negligence claim. We disagree. \r\n\r\nIn the order granting summary judgment, the trial court cited four exemptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity which applied to bar a negligence claim against the City: subsections (1), (2), (12) and (13) of section 15-78-60.5 The Court of Appeals, however, reversed summary judgment, citing only section 15-78-60(12). This exception contains a gross negligence standard regarding the licensing powers of a governmental entity. The Court of Appeals found that there were material issues of fact because: (1) the City based its revocation of the permit on the building's structural damage rather than the cost of repair; (2) Staubes had submitted three estimates showing the cost of repair was less than fifty percent of the building's pre-Hugo value; (3) the City's actions were based on the opinion of an engineer not licensed to practice in South Carolina; and (4) the City offered \"no affidavits or supporting materials suggesting its actions were reasonably consistent with accepted standards or otherwise in conformity with what a reasonable governmental entity would do under the circumstances:\" Staubes, 331 S.C. at 206, 500 S.E.2d at 168. \r\n\r\nThe Tort Claims Act provides that the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, and other governmental entities are \"liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\" subject to certain limitations and exemptions within the Act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 1999). Section 15-78-60 sets out \"exceptions\" to this waiver of sovereign immunity. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (Supp. 1999). These exceptions act as limitations on the liability of a governmental entity. The burden of establishing a limitation upon liability under the Tort Claims Act is upon the governmental entity asserting it as an affirmative defense. Strange v. South Carolina Dept of Highways and Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 445 S.E.2d 439 (1994).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City contends that while the exemption cited by the Court of Appeals contains a gross negligence standard, it has absolute immunity under the other exemptions cited by the trial court, specifically the inspection powers exception, section 15-78-60(13).\r\nThis same issue was recently decided in Steinke v. South Carolina Dept of Labor Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999). The Court found in Steinke that \"when an exception containing the gross negligence standard applies, that same standard will be read into any other applicable exception.\" Id. at _, 520 S.E.2d at 155. Accord Duncan v: Hampton County School Dist. #2, 335 S.C. 535, 517 S.E.2d 449 (Ct. App. 1999); Jackson v. South Carolina Dept of Corrections, 301 S.C. 125, 390 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 1989), affd 302 S.C. 519, 397 S.E.2d 377 (1990). Therefore, Steinke disposes of the City's argument in this case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the Court of Appeals did not err in addressing the negligence claim. On the merits, we affirm the Court of Appeals' decision to reverse summary judgment on the negligence cause of action.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1 See S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-78-10 to -200 (Supp. 1999).\r\n2 Additionally, the trial court found no taking and no deprivation of due process.\r\n3 The trial court cited subsections (1), (2), (12) and (13) of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-78-60 (Supp. 1999).\r\n4 Indeed, even to the Court of Appeals the City continued to argue against the merits of the negligence claim. It was not until the City obtained an adverse ruling from the Court of Appeals that it raised an error preservation argument.\r\n5 Section 15-78-60 sets out 33 different exemptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity. The statute provides as follows in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  The governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:\r\n  \r\n    (1) legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial action or inaction;\r\n    (2) administrative action or inaction of a legislative, judicial, or quasi judicial nature;\r\n    . . .\r\n    (12) licensing powers or functions including, but not limited to, the issuance, denial, suspension, renewal, or revocation of or failure or refusal to issue, deny, suspend, renew, or revoke any permit, license, certificate, approval, registration, order, or similar authority except when the power or function is exercised in a grossly negligent manner;\r\n    (13) regulatory inspection powers or functions, including failure to make an inspection, or making an inadequate or negligent inspection, of any property to determine whether the property complies with or violates any law, regulation, code, or ordinance or contains a hazard to health or safety.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C.

We \r\naffirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe facts in this case are undisputed. Appellant \r\nbegan employment as a public school teacher in August 1972 and \r\nwas enrolled in the state retirement plan until she terminated her \r\nemployment in June 1973. She entered law school full-time in August 1973 and \r\ngraduated May 10, 1976. On October 8, 1976, she began employment with the State \r\nDepartment of Education.\r\nIn May 1995, appellant filed a request with \r\nrespondent South Carolina Retirement Systems (Agency) for two \r\nyears' retroactive educational leave pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1140 which at \r\nthe time provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A member who leaves employment to attend \r\n    graduate school and returns directly to employment \r\n    may establish up to two years' retirement credit by paying the \r\n    actuarial cost as determined by the [State Budget and \r\n    Control] Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nAgency denied appellant's request on the ground \r\nshe had not returned \"directly\" to, covered employment. On \r\nappeal, the Board and the circuit court both affirmed Agency's \r\ndecision.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Is Agency's interpretation of Â§ 9-1-1140 \r\n    arbitrary and capricious?\r\n  2. Does it violate equal \r\n    protection?\r\n  3. Did Agency miscalculate the ninety-day \r\n    period?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n1. Arbitrary and capricious\r\n\r\nThe dispute in this case centers on the \r\nstatutory requirement that an applicant requesting retirement credit \r\nfor educational leave must have returned \"directly\" to covered employment. \r\nAgency interpreted the word \"directly\" in Â§ 9-1-1140 to mean \r\n\"immediately\" but allowed a grace period of ninety days to return to covered \r\nemployment. The grace period was apparently formulated to accommodate teachers \r\nwho have an annual three month lapse in employment during the summer but \r\nit was applied to all covered employees, not only teachers. Agency \r\nfound appellant's reemployment did not commence within this \r\nninety-day period.\r\nAppellant contends she returned directly to \r\ncovered employment because she was not otherwise employed between \r\nher attendance at law school and her subsequent covered \r\nemployment.\r\nBoth \"immediately\" and \"next in order\" are \r\ncommon meanings for the word \"directly.\" RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, Second Edition, Unabridged (1987). In the context of Â§ 9-1-1140, \"directly\" can have either meaning and the \r\nstatute is therefore ambiguous. In construing an ambiguous statute, we give \r\ngreat deference to the government agency's consistent application of \r\nthe statute. Bunch v. Cobb, 273 S.C. 445, 257 S.E.2d 225 \r\n(1979).\r\nFurther, after appellant filed her claim, the \r\nlegislature amended Â§ 9-1-1140 to specifically \r\nprovide:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A member who leaves covered employment to \r\n    attend undergraduate or graduate school and returns \r\n    to covered employment within ninety days \r\n    after the member's last date of enrollment may establish \r\n    up to two years' retirement credit by paying the \r\n    actuarial cost as determined by the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).1 A subsequent \r\nstatutory amendment may be interpreted as clarifying original legislative intent. \r\nCotty v. Yartzeff, 309 S.C. 259, 422 S.E.2d 100 (1992). The legislature's subsequent \r\nadoption of a specific time period in Â§ 9-1-1140 is evidence of legislative \r\nintent that \"directly\" be given a time-related meaning.\r\nMoreover, retirement statutes should be \r\nliberally construed in favor of those to be benefitted and the \r\nobjective sought to be accomplished. King v. South Carolina Retirement \r\nSystems, 319 S.C. 373, 461 S.E.2d 822 (1995). Under appellant's interpretation, an \r\nemployee who took temporary employment for no matter how short a period \r\nwhile awaiting covered employment would be precluded. A time-related \r\nmeaning of \"directly,\" on the other hand, promotes the objective of \r\nallowing covered employees to further their education while encouraging their \r\nprompt return to work. We find Agency's allowance of a ninety-day grace \r\nperiod is a liberal construction of \"directly.\"\r\nAppellant contends, however, the ninety-day \r\ngrace period is arbitrary and capricious. She argues it benefits \r\nteachers but penalizes lawyers since it is impossible to pass the bar \r\nexamination and be admitted to practice within ninety days of graduation from \r\nlaw school. We note it is a common practice among state agencies, including \r\nthis Court, to employ law school graduates as attorneys contingent upon \r\nadmission to the bar. In fact, appellant herself began employment as an \r\nattorney with the State Department of Education before she was admitted \r\nto the bar. Lawyers as well as teachers may return to covered \r\nemployment within ninety days and therefore may benefit from Agency's allowance of \r\nthis grace period. We conclude Agency's interpretation of Â§ 9-1-1140 \r\nis not arbitrary and capricious.\r\n2. Equal protection\r\n\r\nAppellant contends Agency's allowance of a \r\nninety-day grace period discriminates in favor of teachers. She \r\nclaims an equal protection violation in Agency's enforcement of the \r\nstatute. This argument is without merit.\r\n\r\nA law fair on its face \r\nmay be shown to violate equal protection if it is intentionally enforced discriminatorily. \r\nButler v. Town of Edgefield, 328 S.C. 238, 493 S.E.2d 838 (1997). There is \r\nabsolutely no evidence in the record that Agency discriminates in favor of \r\nteachers in applying the ninety day grace period. To the contrary, the record \r\naffirmatively indicates the ninety-day period is applied to all covered \r\nemployees.\r\n3. Calculation of ninety \r\ndays\r\n\r\nAppellant contends Agency erred in calculating \r\nthe ninety-day grace period from her date of graduation in May \r\n1976 rather than the date she completed the bar examination on July 30, \r\n1976. Using appellant's calculation, her re-employment commenced within \r\nthe ninety-day period on October 8, 1976.\r\nThe applicable version of Â§ 9-1-1140 provided \r\nsimply that \"a member who leaves employment to attend \r\ngraduate school and returns directly to employment\" is eligible for \r\nretirement credits. The 1996 amendment specifies a return to covered \r\nemployment within ninety days \"after the member's last date of enrollment.\" This subsequent amendment, while not controlling, may be construed as \r\nclarifying the legislature's original intent. Cotty v. Yartzeff, supra. \r\nFurther, the plain language of the applicable version of Â§ 9-1-1140 specifies attendance at graduate school. The optional bar review course, which appellant took \r\nafter graduation from law school, and the bar examination were not part of \r\nher attendance at law school. Accordingly, Agency did not err in \r\ncalculating the ninety-day period.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER and \r\nBURNETT, JJ., concur. TOAL, A.J., and FINNEY, C.J.,:dissenting in a separate \r\nopinion.\r\n_____________\r\n1 Effective June 19, 1996.\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J.: I respectfully \r\ndissent.\r\n\r\nI agree with the majority that the \r\nphrase \"return directly to employment\" in the statute is ambiguous. Where a statute is \r\nambiguous, this Court must construe the terms of the statute. Lester v. \r\nSouth Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n, 334 S.C. 557, 514 \r\nS.E.2d 751 (1999).\r\nInitially, the majority errs in relying so \r\nheavily on the Retirement Systems's interpretation of the term \"directly\" in this case. While this Court will give the statutory construction of the \r\nofficials charged with its administration respectful consideration, an \r\nagency's position is accorded less weight in situations, such as the current one, \r\nwhere the interpretation of the statute does not involve the exercise of \r\nadministrative expertise. See Knight u. Board of Trustees of Firemen's \r\nRetirement and Pension Fund of Columbia Fire Dep't., 269 S.C. 671, 239 S.E.2d 720, \r\n721(1977); see also Stone Mfg. Co. v. South Carolinas Employment Sec. Comm'n, 219 \r\nS.C. 239, 64 S.E.2d 644, 648 (1951)(\"At most, administrative practice is a \r\nweight in the scale, to be considered, but not to be inevitably followed. . \r\n.\").\r\nThis Court's primary function in interpreting a \r\nstatute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature. Roche v. Young \r\nBros., Inc. of Florence, 332 S.C. 75, 504 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1998). Here, the legislature \r\nintended to give state employees who left state employment to pursue \r\nhigher.education and then return to state employment the opportunity to purchase \r\nretirement credit. When interpreting such a statute offering a benefit to state \r\nemployees, we must remember the purposes of the state's retirement act are \r\nremedial and beneficent. Knight, 269 S.C. 671, 239 S.E.2d 720. Accordingly, the \r\nstatutes will be liberally construed in favor of those to be benefitted and the \r\nobjects sought to be accomplished. Id., at 822, 461 S.E.2d at 823.\r\nWhile the Retirement Systems's 90 day grace \r\nperiod may be a liberal interpretation of the phrase, it is not a \r\nrational one. The relevant group for analysis in this case is all state employees who \r\nleave for higher education. Interpreting the phrase \"directly\" to mean \r\nimmediately while having a 90 day grace period allows one class of employees, \r\nschool teachers getting graduate degrees, to purchase retirement credit while \r\ndenying that opportunity to another similarly situated class, employees \r\npursuing a law degree. The question for this Court is whether it is \r\nimproper to single out a portion of the overall group for different \r\ntreatment.\r\nThe requirements of equal protection are \r\nmet if (1) the classification bears a reasonable relationship \r\nto the legislative purpose sought to be effected; (2) the members of the class are treated alike \r\nunder similar circumstances; and (3) the classification rests on a reasonable \r\nbasis. Robinson v. Richland County Council, 293 S.C. 27, 358 S.E.2d 392 \r\n(1987). In order to practice law in this state, all law school graduates must take and \r\npass the South Carolina Bar exam. See Rule 402, SCACR; Rule 410, \r\nSCACR. Under the Retirement Systems's approach, state employees graduating \r\nfrom law school are able to purchase retirement credit only if they return \r\nto employment before passing the bar exam.1 In other \r\nwords, the Retirement Systems's interpretation prevents law school graduates from using their graduate \r\ndegree if they desire to return to state employment and purchase retirement \r\ncredit. Such a position directly conflicts with the legislative purpose of \r\ngranting a benefit to employees seeking higher education and is not an interpretation \"liberally construed in favor of those to be benefitted.\"\r\nAlso, the adoption of a grace period reveals the \r\nRetirement Systems understood the Legislature did not intend for \"directly\" to mean graduates would have to be employed the first day they \r\nwere available after graduation. However, choosing an arbitrary 90 day limit that \r\ncovers only a portion of the returning employees does not have a rational \r\nbasis. While there is no doubt that a policy focusing solely on a 90 day \r\nlimitation is simpler to administer than a policy that actually looks to see whether an \r\nemployee returns directly to work after obtaining a graduate degree, choosing such \r\na date is arbitrary where under the limit certain groups of employees are \r\nguaranteed to be excluded from obtaining the benefit.\r\nFurthermore, the 90 day restriction was not \r\nincluded in the statute nor in any regulation adopted by the Retirement \r\nSystems. The Retirement Systems's failure to follow the State Register \r\nand Administrative Procedures Act in adopting a 90 day grace period should \r\nalone be enough to prevent enforcement of the Retirement Systems's \r\n  restriction.2 Failing to \r\nofficially adopt the 90 day restriction as a regulation so that \r\nthere would be notice of the deadline even led to the initiation of Stuckey's \r\ncase. She discovered the possibility of purchasing the credit when an \r\nemployee of the Retirement System told her she would qualify for the credit. Also, \r\nif Mrs. Stuckey had read the statute and all pertinent regulations while \r\nplanning to attend law school, she would have received no notice that she would \r\nface a strict day limitation that she could not meet.\r\nBased on the foregoing, I would reverse the \r\ndecision of the trial court.\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n_____________\r\n1The majority points out that often law school graduates are employed by the State before the bar results are delivered. Such kind treatment cannot be counted upon for all law graduates. Furthermore, during this period the employee cannot be employed as a practicing lawyer without violating the law. The legislation itself does not violate equal protection, the agency's use of a 90 day time period violates equal protection as applied.\r\n2This act \r\nstates:\r\nThere shall be filed with the Legislative \r\nCouncil and published in the State Register:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) All regulations promulgated or proposed to \r\n    be promulgated by state agencies which have general \r\n    public applicability and legal effect, including all of \r\n    those which include penalty provisions. Provided, however, that the \r\n    text of regulations as finally promulgated by an agency shall not be \r\n    published in the State Register until such regulations have been \r\n    approved by the General Assembly in accordance with Â§ 1-23-120 \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C.

Maguire, of \r\n                Suggs &amp; Kelly, of Myrtle Beach, for petitioner., John P. Bacot, Jr., of Surfside \r\n                Beach, for respondents.\r\n        O. Terry Beverly, of Conway, \r\n                guardian ad litem for Elizabeth Dawn \r\n                Pruitt.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE, A.J.: Petitioner (Misty) \r\nand her former husband, Stan Hagy, commenced this action to set aside the \r\n1992 adoption of their daughter by Misty's father and stepmother, respondents \r\nDon and Ann Pruitt. The family court overturned the adoption. The Court \r\nof Appeals reversed. Hagy v. Pruitt, 331 S.C. 213, 500 S.E.2d 168 \r\n(Ct. App. 1998). We affirm the Court of Appeals' decision as modified \r\nherein.\r\nFACTS\r\nElizabeth was born on August 25, 1991, two days \r\nafter Misty turned sixteen. Misty and Stan, the baby's \r\neighteen-year-old father, were not married but they were living with the Pruitts at \r\nthe time of Elizabeth's birth. On December 6, 1991, Misty and Stan signed \r\nadoption consent forms allowing the Pruitts to adopt Elizabeth. The \r\nforms were filed December 12. The next day, Don Pruitt gave his written \r\nconsent to allow Misty to marry Stan.1\r\nA final adoption decree was issued June 18, \r\n1992. Misty and Stan remained in the Pruitts' home; however, and \r\ncared for Elizabeth as before. The baby's surname remained \"Hagy.\" In October \r\n1992, Misty and Stan married. Their living arrangement with the \r\nPruitts did not change until Stan moved out alone in October 1993.2\r\nIn August 1994, Misty took Elizabeth with her to \r\nstay at her mother's home in Virginia without the knowledge or \r\nconsent of the Pruitts. A warrant was issued for Misty's arrest on federal \r\nkidnapping charges and she returned with the child to South Carolina in December \r\n1994. She and Stan filed this action on December 12, 1994, to set aside the \r\nadoption.\r\nMisty and Stan contended they were induced to \r\ngive their consent by the Pruitts' fraudulent statements that the \r\nadoption would not be permanent. The Pruitts defended on the merits \r\nand also asserted the action was time-barred under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1800 \r\n(Supp. 1998) which at the time provided: \"No final decree of adoption is \r\nsubject to collateral attack for any reason after a period of one year following \r\nits issuance.\"3\r\nThe family court concluded the time-bar did not \r\napply to actions to set aside an adoption for fraud. On the merits, it \r\nfound Misty's consent (but not Stan's) was procured by Don Pruitt's \r\nmisrepresentations regarding the permanency of the adoption. The family court \r\nconcluded that absent a valid consent, there was no jurisdiction to issue the \r\nadoption decree. Accordingly, it restored Misty's parental rights.4\r\nOn appeal, a majority of the Court of Appeals \r\nreversed finding Â§ 20-7-1800 barred the action because it was commenced \r\nmore than a year after the final adoption decree was entered. In a \r\nconcurring opinion, Judge Howard found Â§ 20-7-1800 did not bar an action to set \r\naside an adoption decree based on extrinsic fraud. He found extrinsic fraud was \r\nnot proved in this case, however, and agreed the family court's order \r\nshould be reversed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1. Can a statute of limitation bar an action to \r\n    set aside a judgment on the ground of extrinsic \r\n    fraud?\r\n  2. Was extrinsic fraud proved in this \r\n    case?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1. Â§ 20-7-1800\r\nThe family court relied on Wold v. Funderbur \r\n, 250 S.C. 205; 157 S.E.2d 180 (1967), and Lowe v. Clayton, \r\n264 S.C. 75, 212 S.E.2d 582 (1975), to find inapplicable the one-year limitation for \r\ncollateral attack on an adoption decree provided by Â§ 20-7-1800. The \r\nCourt of Appeals' majority found these cases were not controlling because \r\nthey were decided prior to the enactment of Â§ 20-7-1800 and concluded Â§ 20-7-1800 barred this action. Judge Howard disagreed. He found such an \r\napplication of Â§ 20-7-1800 would be an unconstitutional restriction of the \r\ncourt's inherent power to consider a collateral attack based on extrinsic \r\nfraud.\r\nWold and Lowe themselves do not \r\nstand for the proposition that an action to set aside an adoption decree for \r\nextrinsic fraud is not subject to an applicable statute of limitation. These cases \r\nsimply hold that a final decree of adoption may be collaterally attacked on the \r\nground of extrinsic fraud. Wold, 250 S.C. at 210, 157 S.E.2d at 183; \r\nLowe, 264 S.C. at 81, 212 S.E.2d at 584 (citing Wold).\r\nIn Center v. Center, 269 S.C. 367, 237 \r\nS.E.2d 491 (1977), we found an action to set aside a judgment procured by fraud \r\nwas not barred by the one year time limit found in Â§ 15-27-130 reasoning \r\nthat the statute by its terms applied only to relief from judgment on grounds \r\nof \"mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.\" Since fraud was not \r\nenumerated in the statute of limitation, the statute did not apply. Id. at \r\n370, 237 S.E.2d at 493; see also South Carolina Dept. of Soc. Sews. v. \r\nDurham, 274 S.C. 222, 262 S.E.2d 49 (1980). Unlike Â§ 15-27-130, however, the statute \r\nof limitation in this case purports to bar all actions to set aside the \r\njudgment. We must therefore determine the novel issue 5 whether a \r\nfacially applicable statute of limitation will bar an action to set aside a judgment \r\nprocured by extrinsic fraud.6\r\nJudge Howard's concurrence in this case \r\nmaintains that a statute of limitation cannot be constitutionally construed \r\nto limit a court's inherent authority to set aside a judgment for extrinsic \r\nfraud. We agree. The legislature cannot restrict the judicial \r\nbranch's exercise of its inherent authority, Williams v. Borden's. Inc., \r\n274 S.C. 275, 262 S.E.2d 881 (1980), which includes the inherent authority to set \r\naside a judgment on the ground of extrinsic fraud. See Center v. \r\nCenter, supra. Accordingly, we hold Â§ 20-7-1800 does not bar an action to set aside an \r\nadoption on the ground of extrinsic fraud.7\r\n2. Extrinsic fraud\r\nA judgment may be set aside on the ground of \r\nfraud only if the fraud is \"extrinsic\" and not \"intrinsic.\" Corley v. \r\nCentennial Const. Co., 247 S.C. 179, 146 S.E.2d 609 (1966). Extrinsic fraud is \r\ncollateral or external to the trial of the matter. Mr. G. v. Mrs. G., 320 S.C. \r\n305, 465 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995). It is \"fraud that induces a person not to \r\npresent a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.\" Hilton Head \r\nCenter of South Carolina. Inc. v. Public Service Comm'n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, \r\n362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987). Intrinsic fraud, on the other hand, is fraud presented and \r\nconsidered in the trial. Evans v. Gunter, 366 S.E.2d 44, 294 S.C. \r\n525 (Ct. App. 1988). For example, perjury is intrinsic fraud and will not support \r\nan action to set aside the judgment. Rycroft v. Tanguay, 279 S.C. \r\n76, 302 S.E.2d 327 (1983).\r\nIn this case, Misty's consent was required for \r\nthe family court to order the adoption of her child. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1690(A)(3) and -1760(B)(2) (Supp. 1999). A mother who signs a consent to \r\nadoption waives her right to notice or appearance at the proceeding. S.C. \r\nCode Ann. Â§ 20-7-1700(A)(9) (Supp. 1999). Thus, if a mother's consent is \r\nfraudulently obtained, such fraud essentially acts to induce the mother not \r\nto present a case. Accordingly, we find the allegation Misty's \r\nconsent was fraudulently obtained sufficiently alleges extrinsic fraud. \r\nSee Lowe v. Clayton, supra.\r\nSince the allegation of extrinsic fraud avoids \r\napplication of the one year time-bar under Â§ 20-7-1800, thequestion then becomes whether such fraud has been proved by clear and convincing \r\nevidence to support setting aside the adoption decree.8 This Court's \r\nscope of review extends to our own view of the preponderance of the evidence in \r\nthis case. Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 457 S.E.2d 336 (1995). The record \r\nindicates the following facts on the issue of fraud.\r\nThe consent forms signed by Misty and Stan \r\ninclude the following language: \"I realize that this \r\nconsent/relinquishment forfeits all my rights and obligations with respect to the named \r\nadoptee . . . . I know that the entry of the final decree of adoption renders any \r\nconsent/relinquishment irrevocable.\" Further, each form states: \"I \r\nexecute this consent freely and voluntarily without duress of any nature or \r\ndescription . . . . I understand that this consent or relinquishment must not be \r\ngiven if psychological advice, legal advice, guidance or counseling is needed \r\nor desired.\" The contents of this consent form are mandated by Â§ 20-7-1700.\r\nMisty testified she and Stan accompanied the \r\nPruitts to the Pruitts' attorney's office where Attorney Mark Chandler \r\nwent over the consent form with them page by page. Chandler subsequently \r\nrealized the consent form needed to be signed in the presence of an \r\nindependent attorney. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1705(A) (Supp. 1999). Misty and \r\nStan then went to Attorney Ann James's office to sign the consent \r\nforms. Both attorneys testified they explained to Misty and Stan that \r\ntheir parental rights would be terminated and their consent was irrevocable \r\nonce the adoption was final.\r\nMisty admitted she understood the consent form \r\nmeant the adoption would be final and she would have no further \r\nparental rights but she didn't believe the document would be controlling \r\nbecause her father had promised her that \"Elizabeth would always be mine.\" Misty \r\nalso testified that when she and Stan expressed reservations about the \r\nadoption, Don threatened to make them pay back a thousand dollars for the \r\nretainer fee for Mark Chandler.\r\nDon Pruitt testified he told Misty and Stan \"they could live with us and come to visit and see her anytime they wanted \r\nto, but we would have control of the baby.\" He denied telling Misty the \r\nadoption was not permanent and denied promising anything or threatening them. \r\nHe admitted he did not want Misty and Stan to marry until after the \r\nadoption was final so that he could continue receiving a dependent's \r\ndisability check for Misty until he began receiving one for Elizabeth.\r\nThe family court found the two attorneys who \r\nseparately advised Misty and Stan regarding the legal significance of the \r\nconsent forms did not inquire beyond the scope of the statutory guidelines. He \r\nconcluded that a guardian ad litem should have been appointed for Misty \r\nbecause of her age. Finally, he concluded Misty's consent was fraudulently \r\nobtained by Don Pruitt's representations that this was an adoption for \r\nconvenience only and that Misty's and Stan's parental rights would not be \r\nabridged.\r\nWe find the evidence Misty's consent was \r\nobtained by fraud is not clear and convincing in light of the fact she signed \r\nthe consent form after being sufficiently advised by two attorneys that the \r\nadoption was irrevocable and that her parental rights would be terminated. By \r\nstatute, Misty's consent is not revocable on the ground she is a minor, S.C. \r\nCode Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690(E) (Supp. 1999), and, contrary to the family \r\ncourt's ruling, there is no applicable requirement that a guardian ad litem be \r\nappointed.9 \r\nSince Misty failed to prove extrinsic fraud by clear and convincing \r\nevidence, the family court erred in overturning the adoption. The Court of \r\nAppeals' decision reversing the family court order is\r\nAFFIRMED AS \r\nMODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, A.C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and \r\nActing Associate Justice George T. Gregory, Jr., concur.\r\n1 A female who resides with a parent and is between the ages of fourteen to eighteen must have parental consent to marry a male between the ages of sixteen to eighteen. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-1-250 (1985).\r\n2 Misty and Stan were divorced a year later.\r\n3 This section was rewritten after the litigation in this case and now provides:\r\n\r\n  (B) A party to adoption proceeding may appeal a final order, judgment, or decree of adoption in the manner provided for appeals from the court in other family court matters. In addition, this section may not be construed to preclude a court's inherent authority to grant collateral relief from a judgment on the ground of extrinsic fraud. For purposes of this subsection, \"extrinsic fraud\" is fraud that induces a person not to present a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard. However, a court is under no obligation to grant a person relief from a judgment based upon extrinsic fraud if the person might have prevented the judgment by the exercise of proper diligence.\r\n\r\n4 To the contrary, Elizabeth's guardian ad litem recommended the adoption be upheld.\r\n5 In Yarbrouah v. Collins, 301 S.C. 339, 391 S.E.2d 873 (1990), the Court of Appeals applied a statute of limitation to an action to set aside a judgment for extrinsic fraud but did not address any challenge to the statute.\r\n6 Most cases discussing this issue involve Rule 60(b) of the rules of civil procedure which are generally modeled on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 60(b)(3) allows one year for a motion for relief from judgment on the ground of fraud by an adverse party but the residual clause of the rule provides: \"This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action . . . to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.\" Courts generally, including our Court of Appeals, have construed this clause to allow an action to set aside a judgment for extrinsic fraud outside the one-year time limit. See Evans v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 366 S.E.2d 44 (Ct. App. 1988); Salway v. Arkava, 215 Mont. 135, 695 P.2d 1302 (1985) (residual clause of Rule 60(b) recognizes the inherent power of a court of equity to set aside its judgments). Rule 60(b), SCRCP, however, does not resolve the issue in this case. Under Rule 81, SCRCP, a rule applies to family court only to the extent it is not inconsistent with the statutes and rules governing that court. Section 20-7-1800, which governs family court procedure, prohibits a collateral attack \"for any reason\" and prevails over Rule 60(b) here.\r\n7 Our conclusion accords with the current version of &sect; 20-7-1800. See footnote 3, supra. Although not an issue in this case, the doctrine of laches will apply in determining whether such an action is barred. See, e.g., In re: Paternity of Tompkins, 518 N.E.2d 500 (Ct. App. Ind. 1988); Pierre v. Edmonds, 645 P.2d 615 (Utah 1982).\r\n8 The general rule is that fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. First State Savings &amp; Loan v. Phelps, 299 S.C. 441, 385 S.E.2d 821 (1989). Other courts have applied this standard of proof to set aside a judgment on the ground of fraud. Nichols v. Klein Tools. Inc., 949 F.2d 1047 (8th Cir. 1991); Godin v. Godin, 725 A.2d 904 (Vt. 1998).\r\n9 The family court \r\nrelied on Rule 17(c), SCRCP, which is applicable to family court under Rule 2, FRCP, and provides: \"The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor or incompetent \r\nperson not otherwise represented in an action . . . .\" By \r\nstatute, however, a consenting mother is not a party to the adoption proceeding. S.C. \r\nCode Ann. Â§ 20-7-1734(A) (Supp. 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25092","title":"Bloom v.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of petitioner James \r\nRavoira, the driver of the automobile. Respondent Marc Bloom appealed, and \r\nthe Court of Appeals reversed. We granted a writ of certiorari to \r\nreview the Court of Appeals' opinion. See Bloom v. \r\nRavoira, Op. No. 98-UP-416 \r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 17, 1998). We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe accident occurred on Meeting Street in \r\nCharleston at approximately 6:30 p.m. on December 23, 1994. \r\nThere was a misty rain falling at the time. Both Ravoira and Bloom were \r\nvisiting Charleston. Bloom was staying at the Meeting Street Inn (the Inn), \r\nlocated on Meeting Street between Market and Cumberland Streets. At both ends of \r\nthis block of Meeting Street, there are crosswalks, traffic lights, and \r\nwalk/don't walk signals.\r\nThe parties deposed several witnesses. In his \r\ndeposition, Bloom testified that he was in the lobby of the Inn \r\nwaiting for his mother and girlfriend to come downstairs to go to dinner. \r\nBloom was wearing jeans and a navy-colored overcoat. He explained that his car \r\nwas parked in a lot directly across the street from the Inn and he was going \r\nto put a gift - a taxidermically stuffed, mounted pig - inside the car. According \r\nto Bloom, he exited the Inn and was going to cross the street. He looked to the \r\nleft and then to the right. As he began to cross the street, he was struck from \r\nhis left by Ravoira's car. Bloom stated that it happened fast and he never saw \r\nthe car that struck him. He sustained injuries to his lower right leg and \r\nleft hip.\r\nRavoira testified that at the time of the \r\naccident, he and his wife were driving along Meeting Street on their way \r\nto a restaurant located on Queen Street. Ravoira had his lights and \r\nwindshield wipers on, and he estimated that he was traveling approximately 20 \r\nm.p.h. Ravoira explained that he was traveling slowly because his wife \r\nwas looking for Queen Street. He stopped at the traffic light at Market Street. \r\nWhen the light turned green, Ravoira pulled forward, heard his wife yell his \r\nname, and saw something out of his peripheral vision. Then he heard a thud. \r\nAfter a pause, the car's windshield shattered.\r\nRavoira's wife Lowanda was in the passenger seat \r\nof the car and was looking for Queen Street. Lowanda testified \r\nthat from the corner of her eye, she saw a person carrying something come \r\ntoward her passenger window. She called out her husband's name. She testified \r\nthat the car stopped almost simultaneously with the impact and then the \r\nwindshield broke.\r\n\r\nHelena Mariella-Walrond, a guest at the Inn, \r\ntestified that she was in the lobby at the time of the accident \r\nenjoying the Inn's complimentary wine and cheese hour. Helena explained that she \r\nnoticed when Bloom entered the lobby because of the stuffed pig he was carrying \r\nunder his arm. Helena saw Bloom get a beer and then soon after leave the \r\nlobby. According to Helena, Bloom hesitated for \"a split second\" and then \r\nran across the street. Helena heard a \"thump\" and stated that she knew Bloom \r\nhad been hit by a car. Helena also testified that when Bloom entered the \r\nstreet, he went in between two parked vehicles and the vehicle on Bloom's left \r\nwas a sport utility vehicle.\r\n\r\nJohn and Margaret Simpson were in the car \r\ntraveling behind Ravoira. Margaret stated that Ravoira was \r\ntraveling within the speed limit, and John estimated Ravoira's speed to be 25 \r\nm.p.h. Both John and Margaret testified that they did not notice any reckless \r\ndriving by Ravoira. Both also stated that they did not see Bloom at all before \r\nthe accident. Margaret testified that Ravoira's car \"veered just a little,\" and \r\nthey had to stop because the Ravoiras had stopped. Margaret then saw Bloom \r\nfall into the street. According to Margaret, there were cars parked in front of \r\nthe Inn and therefore, Bloom must have entered the street from between parked \r\ncars or in front of a parked car.\r\n\r\nRavoira moved for summary judgment, and the \r\ntrial court granted the motion. The trial court found that even if \r\nRavoira was in some way negligent, no reasonable jury could find that \r\nRavoira's negligence equaled, or was greater than, Bloom's negligence. On appeal, \r\nthe Court of Appeals reversed holding that there were questions of material \r\nfact which precluded summary judgment.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the \r\n    trial court's grant of summary judgment?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nRavoira argues that no \r\nreasonable jury could find that Bloom's negligence was not greater than any negligence \r\non the part of Ravoira. We agree.\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is warranted if there is no \r\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is \r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP. In determining whether \r\nany triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can \r\nbe reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most \r\nfavorable to the non-moving party. Koester v. Carolina Rental Ctr. \r\nInc, 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d \r\n392, 394 (1994). Even when there is no dispute as to the \r\nevidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn \r\nfrom them, summary judgment should be denied. Id.\r\nBloom alleged in his complaint that Ravoira \r\nnegligently caused his injuries. To establish a cause of action in \r\nnegligence, a plaintiff must prove the following three elements: (1) a duty of care \r\nowed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach of that duty by a negligent act or \r\nomission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty. E.g., \r\nBishop v. South Carolina Dep't of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998). However, \r\nunder South Carolina's doctrine of comparative negligence, a \r\nplaintiff may only recover damages if his own negligence is not greater \r\nthan that of the defendant. Nelson v. Concrete Supply \r\nCo., 303 S.C. 243, 399 \r\nS.E.2d 783 (1991).\r\nOrdinarily, comparison of the plaintiff s \r\nnegligence with that of the defendant is a question of fact for the jury to \r\ndecide. Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources \r\nDept, 328 S.C. 24, 32, 491 \r\nS.E.2d 571, 575 (1997); accord Brown v. \r\nSmalls, 325 S.C. 547, 481 \r\nS.E.2d 444 (Ct. App. 1997). In a comparative negligence case, the trial \r\ncourt should only determine judgment as a matter of law if the sole \r\nreasonable inference which may be drawn from the evidence is that the plaintiff s \r\nnegligence exceeded fifty percent. Creech, 328 S. C. at 33, 491.S.E.2d at \r\n575 (discussing directed verdict standard); see also Hopson v. Clary, 321 S. C. 312, \r\n314, 468 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"If the evidence as a whole is susceptible to \r\nonly one reasonable inference, no jury issue is created\" and a directed verdict \r\nmotion is properly granted). Therefore, summary judgment is generally not \r\nappropriate in a comparative negligence case.\r\nUnder South Carolina law, Ravoira, as a driver, \r\nand Bloom, as a pedestrian, owed certain duties. Regarding \r\npedestrian duties, a \"pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than \r\nwithin a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection \r\nshall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway.\" S.C. Code \r\nAnn. Â§ 56-5-3150(a) (1991). In addition, where traffic-control signals operate \r\nbetween adjacent intersections, \"pedestrians shall not cross at any place except \r\nin a marked crosswalk.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-3150(c) (1991). Drivers are \r\ncharged with the duty to exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-3230 (1991).\r\nOn summary judgment motion, a court must view \r\nthe facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. \r\n    Koester, supra. \r\nNonetheless, a court \"cannot ignore facts unfavorable to that \r\nparty and [it] must determine whether a verdict for the party opposing the \r\nmotion would be reasonably possible under the facts.\" \r\n  Hopson, 321 S.C. at \r\n314, 468 S.E.2d at 307 (discussing directed verdict motion). In our \r\nopinion, a verdict for Bloom is not reasonably possible under the facts of this \r\ncase.\r\nFirst, we note there are many facts which, even \r\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to Bloom, clearly show that \r\nBloom was negligent. For example, the' undisputed facts establish that \r\nBloom entered the street, from between two parked cars, and was struck by \r\nRavoira's vehicle. Bloom testified that he looked left, then right, and then \r\nentered the street. However, he was struck from his left and he did not state that \r\nhe looked to his left again after looking right. A disinterested witness testified \r\nthat the accident occurred a split second after Bloom entered the street. Bloom and \r\nRavoira both testified that neither one saw the other prior to impact, and \r\nthe Simpsons also stated that they did not see Bloom prior to the accident. \r\nThe only inference to be drawn from this evidence is that Bloom entered the \r\nstreet quickly and without any warning to drivers.\r\nMoreover, although there were crosswalks and \r\ntraffic signals at both corners, Bloom chose to cross in the middle \r\nof the block. Thus, by Bloom's own testimony, he breached his duties as a \r\npedestrian. See S.C. \r\nCode Ann. Â§ 56-5-3150 (1991). This breach is compounded by \r\nthe fact that it was dark and rainy out, and Bloom - who was dressed in dark \r\nclothing - quickly entered the street from between two parked \r\nvehicles.\r\nRegarding Ravoira's conduct, the evidence \r\nestablishes that Ravoira was driving no more than 25 m.p.h. and was not \r\ndriving recklessly. His car lights and windshield wipers were on. Both \r\nRavoira and his wife testified that only she was looking for Queen Street while \r\nRavoira was driving.\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that genuine issues of \r\nmaterial fact existed which prevented summary judgment in \r\nRavoira's favor. For example, the Court of Appeals found that because \r\nRavoira's wife was looking for Queen Street, there was a reasonable inference that \r\nRavoira's attention was diverted and he was not keeping a proper lookout. Ravoira \r\ncontends that the issues of fact highlighted by the Court of Appeals do not \r\nrise to the level of \"material\" issues of fact because, as a matter of law, the \r\nevidence shows that Bloom is more than fifty percent negligent. We \r\nagree.\r\nThe instant case is analogous to Hopson \r\nv. Clary, supra. \r\nIn Hopson, the facts showed that the plaintiff Hopson was \r\ndriving down a street and the defendant Clary was driving behind her. Hopson \r\nslowed down and pulled her car to the right. When Hopson attempted a \r\nU-turn, Clary's vehicle collided with Hopson's vehicle. \r\n    Hopson, 321 S.C. at \r\n313, 468 S.E.2d at 307. The trial court granted a directed verdict for Clary finding \r\nthat, as a matter of law, Hopson's own negligence was greater than any potential \r\nnegligence by Clary. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Specifically, the Court of \r\nAppeals found that the evidence showed that \"Hopson attempted an inherently \r\nprecarious maneuver without ascertaining whether she could do so \r\nsafely.\" Id. at 315, 468 S.E.2d at 308.\r\nHere, the undisputed facts establish that Bloom \r\nattempted to cross the street but did not do so in a safe, \r\nreasonable manner. Any factual issues which might exist as to Ravoira's fault in this \r\naccident cannot alter the inescapable conclusion that, as a matter of law, \r\nBloom's fault exceeded fifty percent. Where evidence of the plaintiff's eater \r\nnegligence-is overwhelming, evidence of slight negligence on the part of the \r\ndefendant is simply not enough for a case to go to the jury. See \r\nid. at 314, 468 S.E.2d at \r\n307 (where the evidence as a whole is susceptible to only one \r\nreasonable inference, no jury issue is created).\r\nWe note that our decision is no departure from \r\nthe rule that summary judgment is a \"drastic remedy\" which \r\nshould be \"cautiously invoked.\" Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. \r\nCo., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 \r\nS.E.2d 537, 543 (1991) (citations omitted). Nevertheless, in \r\nthe rare case where a verdict is not reasonably possible under the facts \r\npresented, summary judgment is proper. Accordingly, we find that the trial \r\ncourt correctly granted summary judgment and the Court of Appeals erred in \r\nreversing the trial court's decision.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the Court of Appeals' opinion which \r\nreversed the grant of summary judgment.\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and \r\nActing Associate Justice R.

The circuit court \r\ngranted summary judgment to respondents on the issues relating to deer and \r\nturkey hunting. We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondents Lee and Burris are hunters who want \r\nto hunt big game on Sunday on land each owns in Newberry and \r\nFairfield Counties. However, hunting big game on Sunday on privately owned \r\nproperty in eighteen Upstate counties, including Newberry and \r\nFairfield counties, is prohibited.1 See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-9-510(9) and \r\n(10) (Supp. 1998) (describing big game as deer, turkey, and bear); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-310(A)(1) and (2) (Supp. 1998) (establishing season for taking antlered \r\ndeer in the eighteen Upstate counties, with Sundays excepted); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-530 (Supp. 1998) (granting Department authority to prescribe \r\nmethods and areas in which turkeys may be hunted); 27 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. \r\n123-40(2.8) (prohibiting Sunday hunting of deer, turkey, and bear in the \r\neighteen Upstate counties).2\r\n\r\nHunting of big game is allowed on \r\nSunday on privately owned property in the state's remaining twenty-eight counties \r\nbecause no statute or regulation prohibits it.\r\nDepartment contends the circuit court erred in \r\nruling that statutory and regulatory prohibitions on Sunday hunting of \r\nbig game in the eighteen Upstate counties violate: 1) equal protection \r\nand 2) the special laws provision of the state constitution.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  1) Did the circuit court err in ruling that the \r\n    statutory and regulatory prohibitions on Sunday hunting violate equal \r\n    protection?\r\n  2) Did the circuit court err in ruling that the \r\n    statutory and regulatory prohibitions on the hunting of big game violate \r\n    the special laws provision of the state \r\n    constitution?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1) Equal protection\r\nThe privilege to hunt big game is not a \r\n  fundamental right or a suspect class requiring strict or intermediate scrutiny \r\n  of Department's asserted reasons for the Sunday ban. Therefore, we must \r\n  give only minimal scrutiny to the challenged statutes and regulations and \r\n  decide whether a rational basis exists for them. Bibco Corp. v. City \r\n  of Sumter, 332 S.C. 45, 52, 504 S.E.2d 112, 116 (1998) (when a case does not \r\n  involve a suspect or quasi-suspect class, or a fundamental right, the \r\n  statute or ordinance should be tested under the rational basis standard). \r\n  The General Assembly may enact different laws in different geographical \r\n  areas without violating the Equal Protection Clause, provided there is a \r\n  rational basis for the distinctions. See Mosley v. Welch, 218 \r\n  S.C. 242, 250, 62 S.E.2d 313, 317 (1950) (equal protection clause does not require \r\nstatute to apply equally to all areas of the state).\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the Equal Protection Clause, a \r\nclassification must (1) bear a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose \r\nsought to be achieved, (2) members of the class must be treated alike under \r\nsimilar circumstances, and (3) the classification must rest on some \r\nrational basis. D.W. Flowe &amp; Sons. Inc. v. Christopher Constr. Co., 326 \r\nS.C. 17, 23, 482 S.E.2d 558, 562 (1997) (citing Jenkins v. Meares, 302 S.C. \r\n142, 394 S.E.2d 317 (1990)). A legislative enactment will be sustained against \r\nconstitutional attack if there is \"any reasonable hypothesis\" to support it. Id. \r\n(citing Thomas v. Spartanburg Ry., Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 100 S.C. 478, 85 \r\nS.E. 50 (1915)).\r\n\r\nWe must give great deference to the General \r\nAssembly's classification decisions because it presumably debated and \r\nweighed the advantages and disadvantages of the legislation at issue. \r\nFurther, \"[t]he classification does not need to completely accomplish the \r\nlegislative purpose with delicate precision in order to survive a constitutional \r\nchallenge.\" Foster v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways and Pub. \r\nTransn., 306 S.C. 519, 526, 413 S.E.2d 31, 36 (1992).\r\nThe Department offers several reasons in support \r\nof the Sunday hunting ban in the Upstate.\r\n(a) Difficulty of Enforcement\r\nDepartment contends it would be difficult, if \r\nnot impossible, to enforce the statewide ban on Sunday hunting on Wildlife \r\nManagement Areas (WMA) lands in the eighteen Upstate counties if \r\nhunting is allowed on adjacent private properties. We agree.\r\nWMA lands in the Upstate counties typically are \r\nnumerous small areas scattered among private parcels. The \r\naverage size of the 1,275 WMA tracts in the Piedmont is 259 acres. In \r\ncontrast, WMA lands in Pee Dee and Lowcountry counties are substantially larger and \r\nless scattered among private parcels. The average size of the 82 WMA \r\ntracts in the Pee Dee is 1,412 acres, while the average size of the 258 \r\nWMA tracts in the Lowcountry is 1,934 acres. Thus, it is easier to enforce \r\nthe Sunday hunting ban on WMA lands in the Lowcountry and Pee Dee counties, \r\nwhile still allowing Sunday hunting on private property, because the \r\ncontiguous WMA lands are more readily identifiable. While some Pee Dee or \r\nLowcountry WMA parcels may be non-contiguous, Department's conclusions \r\nabout the general nature of the hunting grounds across the state and difficulty \r\nof enforcement in the Upstate are valid and rational.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Sunday hunting ban bears a \r\nreasonable relation to the legislative purpose of the enforcement of \r\nbig game hunting laws. While Department must enforce the Sunday ban on WMA \r\nlands against small game hunters, the addition of big-game hunters \r\nwould exponentially increase the difficulty of that job in the \r\nUpstate.\r\n(b) Preservation of Finite Wildlife \r\nResources\r\nDepartment contends the Sunday ban in the \r\nUpstate counties is necessary to preserve finite wildlife resources \r\nand the continuation of quality hunting experiences. Department's figures show that 39 percent of the \r\ndeer taken in the state in 1996 were taken in the eighteen Upstate \r\ncounties, even though those counties contain less than half the land area of \r\nthe remaining twenty-eight counties. In addition, the number of deer taken \r\nin the Upstate counties increased a \"dramatic\" 46 percent from 1990 to \r\n1996, while the number of deer taken in the remaining counties was \r\nrelatively stable from 1990 to 1995.\r\nDepartment asserts that turkeys are hunted \r\nduring their breeding season because that is when they are the most \r\nactive and most likely to respond to hunters' calls. However, the smaller \r\nland ownership patterns and large number of hunters in the Upstate result in \r\nsubstantial disturbances of the turkey population. To combat those \r\ndisturbances, Department contends banning hunting one day a week during the season \r\nwill increase the chances of successful breeding and continued propagation \r\nof the species - a goal shared by Department and most \r\nhunters.\r\nThe Sunday ban bears a reasonable relation to \r\nthe legislative purpose of preserving finite wildlife resources and \r\nquality hunting experiences. Upstate counties have had to be restocked in \r\nyears past, often with wildlife from the Lowcountry. The popularity of deer \r\nhunting in the Upstate has outpaced the rest of the state, resulting in \r\ngreater pressure on finite resources.\r\nContrary to respondents' assertion, numerous \r\nstudies by Department's experts and others have shown that increased \r\nhuman activity adversely affects turkey behavior, \r\n  including nesting activities.3 Limiting \r\nhuman activity and the hunting of big game, even if \r\nonly for a day, is likely to further these proper goals.\r\n\r\n(c) Other Recreational Users\r\nDepartment contends the Sunday ban gives other \r\nrecreational users - hikers, bird watchers, photographers, and other \r\nnon-hunters - a chance to enjoy the outdoors without hearing the \r\nlarge-caliber gunshots of a big game hunter or being accidentally shot by a big game \r\nhunter. Department contends Sunday is the logical choice because it \r\nfollows Saturday, the busiest hunting day, and is also a day of the week when \r\nmany people do not work and would be most likely to take advantage of \r\nthe outdoors.\r\nThe Sunday ban bears a reasonable relation to \r\nthe legislative purpose of the creation of more opportunities for \r\nnon-hunters to enjoy the outdoors in relative peace. Cf. Timmons v. South Carolina \r\nTricentennial Comm'n, 254 S.C. 378, 393, 175 S.E.2d 805, 812 (1970) \r\n(stating in appeal of condemnation proceeding that \"[p]ublic health, recreation and \r\nenjoyment are recognized public uses\" under law of eminent domain). While \r\nother users may be bothered by small-game hunters or target \r\npractice, the addition of a substantial number of big-game hunters carrying \r\nlarger guns would increase the disturbance and likelihood of \r\naccidents.\r\nIn sum, we find reasons discussed above bear a \r\nreasonable relationship to the legislative purposes, and the Sunday ban \r\nrests on several rational bases.4 Respondents \r\nhave failed to prove an equal protection violation, given the minimal level of scrutiny we must use in \r\nreviewing Department's reasons for the Sunday ban:\r\n\r\nAs to whether members of the designated class \r\nare treated equally, we believe they are. Members of the designated \r\nclass in this case, those who wish to hunt in the Upstate counties, are \r\ntreated alike under similar circumstances. See Eli Witt Co. v. City of \r\nWest Columbia, 309 S.C. 555, 425 S.E.2d 16 (1992). Accordingly, we hold the \r\ncircuit court erred in finding an equal protection violation.\r\n2) Special laws\r\nDepartment contends the circuit court erred in \r\nruling that statutory and regulatory prohibitions on the hunting of \r\nbig game in the eighteen Upstate counties violate Article III, Section \r\n34, of the state constitution. We agree.\r\nThe circuit court misapplied Martin v. \r\nCondon, 324 S.C. 183, 478 S.E.2d 272 (1996). In that case, no \r\nconstitutional provision allowed individual counties to decide whether playing \r\nvideo poker would be criminal. Section 34 prohibits special laws on the \r\nprotection of game - except that special laws may be enacted within each game \r\nzone. Thus, Section 34 allows different regulations within the various zones. \r\nWe have said as much in the rehearing order in Martin, stating that \"[i]t is axiomatic that the prohibition against special laws found in article III, Â§ 34 \r\n(IX), of our constitution does not apply where another constitutional provision \r\nspecifically authorizes a special law.\" Martin, 324 S.C. at 197, 478 \r\nS.E.2d at 279.\r\n\r\nBased upon the above discussion, we believe the \r\nban is rationally related to the protection of game. Accordingly, \r\nwe reverse the circuit court.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., and BURNETT, A.J., concur. WALLER, \r\nA.J., and Acting Associate Justice Thomas E. Huffdissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n1 The state is divided into eleven game zones. The region at issue in this case, which we refer to as the \"eighteen Upstate counties,\" is comprised of Game Zones 1, 2, and 4. Game Zone 1 (Mountain Hunt Unit) consists of Greenville, Oconee, and Pickens counties north of the Norfolk-Southern railroad. Game Zone 2 (Western Piedmont Hunt Unit) consists of Abbeville, Anderson, Edgefield, Greenwood, Laurens, Newberry, McCormick, and Saluda counties, south of Norfolk-Southern railroad. Game Zone 4 (Central Piedmont Hunt Unit) consists of Cherokee, Chester, Fairfield, Lancaster, Spartanburg, Union, and York counties.\r\n\r\n2 The General Assembly amended &sect; 50-11-310 in 1997 to explicitly ban Sunday hunting of antlered deer in the eighteen Upstate counties after respondents filed their lawsuit. 1997 S.C. Act Nos. 33 and 57. The amendments gave Department explicit authority to \"promulgate regulations . . . to establish methods for hunting and taking of deer and for other restrictions for hunting and taking deer\" in the eighteen Upstate counties. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 50-11-310(D) (Supp. 1998).\r\n3The dissent misses the point of this argument. It is not necessary that turkeys be capable of acknowledging the days of the week. Turkeys need only be aware that there is less activity and gunshots which would encourage propagation and advance the Department's goal.\r\n4Contrary to the dissent's assertions, in determining whether there is a legitimate government purpose, the actual motivations of the enacting governmental body are entirely irrelevant. Bibco Corp. v. City of Sumter, supra. Those attacking the validity of the legislation have the burden to negate every conceivable basis which might support it. Federal Communications Comm'n v. Beach Communications Inc., 508 U.S. 307,314, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 2102, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993). Moreover, because we do not require the legislature to articulate its reasons for enacting a statute, it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature. Id. \"In fact, a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom fact-finding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data. Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.\" Id.

(quoting Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 942-943, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979)).\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: I respectfully \r\ndissent. I would affirm the grant of summary judgment to respondents Lee and Burris \r\nbecause the ban on Sunday hunting in eighteen Upstate counties violates \r\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the state and federal constitutions.\r\nIt is undisputed that wild game and fish belong \r\nto no one in particular. Courts have classified them either \r\nas the property of the State or as being held in trust by the State for the benefit \r\nof the people as a whole. Thus, while every landowner has a right to hunt and \r\nfish on his or her property, that right is subject to reasonable governmental \r\nregulation. Rice Hope Plantation v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., 216 \r\nS.C. 500, 524, 59 S.E.2d 132, 142 (1950), overruled on other grounds, McCall by \r\nAndrews v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741(1985); Begay v. \r\nSawtelle, 88 P.2d. 999, 1000 (Ariz. 1939). \"The wild game within a state . . . is not the \r\nsubject of private ownership, except in so far as the people may elect to make it so; and \r\nthey may, if they see fit, absolutely prohibit the taking of it, or traffic or \r\ncommerce in it, if it is deemed necessary for the protection or preservation, of the public \r\ngood.\" Michigan v. Zimber , 33 N.W.2d 104, 105 (Mich. 1948).\r\nGovernmental regulation, however, may not \r\nviolate equal protection guarantees, which provide that \"[n]o State shall \r\n. . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the \r\nlaws.\" U.S. Const. amend XIV, Â§ 1; accord S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3; Baldwin v. Fish &amp; Game Comm'n of Montana, 436 U.S. 371, 391, 98 S.Ct. 1852, 1864, 56 L.Ed.2d \r\n354, 370 (1978) (\"[s]o long as constitutional requirements have been met .... \r\n[p] rotection of the wild life of the State is peculiarly within the police power, and \r\nthe State has great latitude in determining what means are appropriate for its \r\nprotection\"); Begay v. Sawtelle, 88 P.2d at 1000 (the State may regulate the \"taking or killing and use of any and all kinds of game in any part of the state, and \r\nduring any period, and upon any reasonable terms, so long as such regulation \r\ndoes not deny due process of law and equal protection of law\").\r\nWe often state, as the majority does in this \r\ncase, that the party asserting the unconstitutionality of a statute \r\nor regulation has the burden of proving the classification is essentially \r\narbitrary and without any reasonable basis. Foster v. South Carolina Dep't of \r\nHighways and Pub. Transp., 306 S.C. 519, 526, 413 S.E.2d 31, 36 (1992). While true, \r\nthat statement is somewhat misleading. Given that it often is impossible to \r\nabsolutely demonstrate  a negative proposition, a party may meet this \r\nburden by successfully attacking the reasons asserted in support of a statute or \r\nregulation. See Southern Bell Tel. and Tel. Co. v. City of Spartanburg, \r\n285 S.C. 495, 331 S.E.2d 333 (1985) (placing burden of proof upon telephone company, but \r\nfinding equal protection violation where city failed to advance any rational basis \r\nfor business license ordinance that taxed telephone company at higher rate than \r\nother businesses); Casey v. Richland County Council, 282 S.C. 387, \r\n320 S.E.2d 443 (1984) (finding equal protection violation where county failed to \r\noffer a rational basis for imposing surcharge on residents who would not benefit \r\nfrom new sewer system because they already received sewer service from other \r\nsystems); see also Demmert v. Kootznoowoo. Inc., 960 P.2d 606, 610 \r\n(Alaska 1998) (recognizing in discussion of summary judgment issue that proof needed to show \r\nthe affirmative of a proposition is often different, and more \r\nlimited, than proof needed to show the negative of the same proposition).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Legislature and Department \r\nhave established two classes of people: hunters in the eighteen \r\nUpstate counties who may not hunt big game on Sunday on their private property and \r\nhunters elsewhere in the state who may hunt big game on Sunday on their \r\nprivate property.\r\nI agree with the majority that we must give \r\nminimal scrutiny to the challenged statutes and regulations because the \r\nright to hunt big game is not a fundamental right or a suspect class requiring \r\nstrict or intermediate scrutiny. However, I do not believe Department's asserted \r\nreasons for the Sunday hunting ban in the Upstate can withstand even minimal \r\nscrutiny.\r\nA. DIFFICULTY OF ENFORCEMENT IN \r\nUPSTATE\r\nDuring various hunting seasons, \"[n]o Sunday \r\nhunting is permitted on any [Wildlife Management Area] lands\" throughout the state. 27 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 123-400.8) (1992). WMA lands consist \r\nof property owned or leased by Department, or privately held property that an \r\nowner voluntarily has placed in the program. Hunting on WMA lands is allowed \r\nonly under regulations governing those lands. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-2200 (Supp. 1999); 27 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 123-40.\r\nDepartment contends it would be difficult or \r\nimpossible to enforce the statewide ban on Sunday hunting on WMA lands \r\nin the eighteen Upstate counties if hunting were allowed on adjacent \r\nprivate properties. Department asserts it is easier to enforce the Sunday \r\nhunting ban on WMA lands in the Lowcountry and Pee Dee counties, while still \r\nallowing Sunday hunting on private property.\r\n\r\nI find Department's reasoning utterly \r\nunpersuasive. Department must enforce other laws and regulations on \r\nSunday on private and WMA lands in the Upstate counties. Department must, for \r\nexample, prevent small-game hunting on WMA lands on Sunday while allowing it \r\non private property.1 Furthermore, some WMA lands in the remaining \r\ntwenty-eight counties are scattered among private parcels just like the \r\nUpstate. Enforcement is as difficult in those areas as it is in the Upstate counties. \r\nThus, the Sunday hunting ban does not bear a reasonable relation to the \r\nasserted legislative purpose - the enforcement of hunting laws. Similarly, \r\nDepartment's stated reason that enforcement is more difficult in the Upstate \r\ndoes not provide a rational basis for the ban.\r\nB. PRESERVATION OF FINITE WILDLIFE RESOURCES AND \r\nQUALITY HUNTING EXPERIENCES\r\nThe hunting season for deer in the eighteen \r\nUpstate counties lasts about three months in the fall and winter. S.C. \r\nCode Ann. Â§ 50-11-10(A)(1) and (2) (Supp. 1999); 27 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. \r\n123-40(1.2) (Supp. 1999). The turkey hunting season in the Upstate counties is set \r\nannually by Department and lasts about one month in the spring. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-530 (Supp. 1999).\r\nDepartment argues the Sunday hunting ban in the \r\nUpstate counties is necessary to preserve finite wildlife \r\nresources and the continuation of quality hunting experiences. Turkeys are hunted during \r\ntheir breeding season because that is when they are the most active and most \r\nlikely to respond to hunters' calls. Department, although allowing Sunday hunting of \r\nturkeys on private property in the remainder of the state, asserts that \r\nturkeys in the eighteen Upstate counties need a day of rest from disturbances \r\nrelated to Sunday hunting. Department contends this will increase the \r\nchances of successful breeding and continued propagation of the species in the \r\nUpstate counties. Department concedes it has no evidence the Sunday ban \r\nfurthers deer propagation.2\r\n\r\nI find Department's reasoning utterly \r\nunpersuasive. The Sunday hunting ban does not bear a reasonable relation \r\nto the asserted legislative purposes - preserving finite wildlife resources \r\nand quality hunting experiences. Deer are admittedly abundant throughout the \r\nstate. As for turkeys, a shorter turkey season would reduce disturbances and \r\naccomplish the same asserted purposes of the Sunday ban. Granting turkeys one \r\nday of peace each week is not reasonably related to the purposes because, \r\nalthough every hunter knows how clever and elusive wild turkeys can be, I \r\nquestion whether they are capable of realizing they do not have to fear being hunted \r\nbecause, \"Hurrah! Today is Sunday!\"3 Department's \r\ncontention is simply too tenuous to bear a reasonable relation to the asserted purposes. Similarly, \r\nDepartment's asserted purposes may be reasons for the Sunday ban, but those \r\nreasons do not rise to the level of rational bases. .\r\n\r\nC. MORE TIME FOR OTHER RECREATIONAL \r\nUSERS\r\nDepartment asserts the Sunday hunting ban gives \r\nother recreational users - hikers, bird watchers, photographers, \r\nand other non-hunters - a chance to enjoy the great outdoors with less chance of \r\nhearing the gunshots of a big game hunter or, far worse, getting accidentally \r\nshot by a big game hunter.\r\nI find Department's reasoning utterly \r\nunpersuasive. Small-game hunters or target shooters on private property, \r\nperhaps using large-caliber weapons, would disturb other recreational users \r\nin the same manner as big game hunters. A hiker bothered by or, worse, shot by \r\na small game hunter or target shooter likely would find no solace in the fact \r\nthe person toting the firearm was not a big game hunter. The firing of any weapon \r\nwould shatter his peace or injure him all the same. Consequently, the \r\nSunday hunting ban does not bear a reasonable relation to the asserted \r\nlegislative purpose; nor does that purpose provide a rational basis for the \r\nban.\r\nIn short, Department offers three carefully \r\ncrafted reasons in support of its Sunday hunting ban: enforcement \r\ndifficulties, preserving wildlife, and ensuring non-hunters have a chance to enjoy the \r\ngreat outdoors. All three appeal to the judicial mind at first glance. It is only \r\nwhen one pauses for a careful examination, and bends closely enough to \r\ndistinguish the tenuous bases, that an exasperated sigh will bring down the entire \r\nhouse of cards constructed by Department.\r\nEnforcement difficulties? Hardly. Department \r\nmust enforce exactly the same laws in equally non-contiguous areas of \r\nthe remaining twenty-eight counties. Preserving wildlife? Hardly. Deer \r\noverrun areas across the state and concededly do not need a weekly day of rest for \r\npropagation, and one day will do absolutely nothing to further turkey \r\npropagation. Peace for non-hunters? Hardly. A gunshot is a gunshot, regardless of \r\nthe type of game sought by the hunter.\r\n\r\nThe majority did not address Department's final \r\nasserted basis for the ban - that unscientific surveys and hearings \r\nconducted by Department show the majority of hunters in the Upstate support \r\nthe ban. That basis certainly is the weakest one asserted by \r\nDepartment.\r\nMy brethren and I undoubtedly would agree that \r\nthe will of the majority is not dispositive in deciding a \r\nconstitutional question. See City of Beaufort v. Baker, 315 S.C. 146, 154, \r\n432 S.E.2d 470, 475 (1993) (recognizing that an important purpose of the constitution is \r\nto protect the few from the many) (Toal, J., dissenting). However, I believe \r\nthose unscientific surveys and the impromptu comments expressed at hearings \r\nreveal an unspoken truth concealed within the twists and turns of the \r\nlegal analysis in this case.\r\nThe Legislature and Department apparently have \r\nconcluded it is politically and socially acceptable to impose a \r\nSunday hunting ban in the Upstate, all the while realizing such an effort \r\nlikely would meet stiff opposition should they attempt it in the Pee Dee and \r\nLowcountry. This attitude, as well as the attitude of the majority of this Court, is a \r\ntacit acknowledgment of the widespread perception in our fair state that \r\nresidents of the Pee Dee and Lowcountry place less importance on Sunday as a \r\nday of worship than our Upstate neighbors. Nothing could be further from \r\nthe truth. Furthermore, I reject that attitude because, like most attempts \r\nto paint people with a broad brush of stereotypes, it misleads more than it \r\ninforms. I simply refuse to accept a stereotypical view of our citizens' wishes as \r\nthe driving force behind a decision upholding a classification that is so patently \r\nunconstitutional.\r\nHunting once was an activity necessary to \r\nsustain life in America; today it is more of a sport or hobby. Although \r\nhunters no longer must seek game to provide their family's dinner, thousands of \r\nhunters from all areas of our state still pursue the activity with a ferocious \r\npassion. Every hunter certainly is subject to statutes and regulations that are \r\nequally and fairly applied to all other hunters, but a hunter should not be subjected to \r\nlaws that violate the Equal Protection Clause.\r\nIn sum, I would hold that respondents have \r\ndemonstrated an equal protection violation based on an analysis of two \r\nfactors discussed above - whether the Sunday hunting ban is reasonably \r\nrelated to a legislative purpose and whether the ban has a rational basis. \r\nAccordingly, I would affirm the trial judge's ruling on this issue. My holding would \r\nmake it unnecessary to address the remaining prong of the analysis - whether \r\nmembers of each designated class are treated alike under similar circumstances - \r\nbecause a failure to meet any prong of the three-part equal protection \r\nanalysis indicates a violation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I would find it unnecessary to \r\naddress Department's argument regarding Article III, Section 34 of \r\nthe state constitution, which prohibits special laws. Because I would conclude \r\nthat the Sunday hunting ban violates equal protection, whether it also \r\nviolates the special laws provision would not affect the resolution of this \r\ncase.\r\nThe separation and independence of each branch \r\nof government require that we go no further than absolutely \r\nnecessary in declaring unconstitutional an action of the Legislature. \r\nStone v. Traynham, 278 S.C. 407, 297 S.E.2d 420 (1982). Thus, a statute may be \r\nconstitutional and valid in part and unconstitutional and invalid in part, and we \r\nmay invalidate a separable part without impairing the .remainder. Strom v. \r\nAMVETS, 280 S.C. 146, 311 S.E.2d 721(1984); Stone v. Traynham, supra. \r\nWhen part of a statute is unconstitutional and another part remains complete in itself, \r\ncapable of being executed wholly independent of the invalid part, and the \r\nremainder is of such a character that we may fairly presume the Legislature would have \r\npassed it independent of that portion which is in conflict with the \r\nConstitution, then we will reject the invalid portion and enforce the remainder. Daniel v. \r\nCruz, 268 S.C. 11, 231 S.E.2d 293 (1977); State v. Harper, 251 S.C. 379, \r\n162 S.E.2d 712 (1968).\r\nI would strike as unconstitutional only the \r\nlanguage pertaining to the Sunday hunting ban because the remaining \r\nprovisions of the statute and regulation may stand alone. They are not so \r\nconnected with the offensive provisions that the Legislature would not have \r\npassed them independently of the offensive provisions. Thus, I would strike the \r\nphrase \"Sundays excepted\" from S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-310(A)(1) and (2) (Supp. \r\n1999). I would strike the following sentence from S.C. Code Ann. Reg. \r\n123-40(2.8) (1992): \"No Sunday hunting is permitted for deer, turkey, or bear \r\nwithin the boundaries of the Central Piedmont, Western Piedmont or Mountain \r\nHunt Units.\" The remaining portions of the statute and regulation would be \r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\nActing Associate Justice Thomas E. Huff, \r\nconcurs.\r\n1 During the hunting season applicable to each species, hunting of small game is allowed on Sunday on privately owned property in all counties because no statute or regulation prohibits it. See S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 50-11-110 (Supp. 1999) (listing species defined as small game, which includes raccoon, opossum, rabbit, squirrel, fox, and quail); S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 50-11-120 (Supp. 1999) (establishing hunting seasons for small game in various game zones); 27 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 123-40(2.8) (1992) (stating that small game may be hunted on Sunday on private lands during the regular game zone seasons in the eighteen Upstate counties).\r\n2 Deer overpopulation is a growing problem in areas of South Carolina that are changing from rural to urban. At least 3,400 deer-vehicle collisions occurred in 1999, killing four people and injuring 320. Deer frequently are seen wandering through urban neighborhoods around Columbia, and they often ruin home gardens. Other urban areas have experienced similar problems. John Monk, In Back Yards and on Back Roads. S.C. Faces a White-Tailed Dilemma, The State, February 20, 2000, at B1: The article also discusses potential \"gun hazards\" caused by careless hunters, but indicates that, overall, deer hunting is a safe activity.\r\n3 It is commonly believed that domestic turkeys are so lacking in mental capacity that they may panic in a rainstorm and run pell-mell into one another, where they pile up and suffocate or drown. Elizabeth Lenhard, Rare Birds the Search for Flavors Leads to Small-scale Farms That Raise Turkeys the Natural Way, Chicago Tribune, Nov.17,1999, at 1999 WL 2932951; Tom Zucco, A Turkey of a Tradition, St. Petersburg Times, Nov. 17, 1999, at 1999 WL 27329061. I know of no one who has encountered a wild turkey \r\nstupid enough to drown in a rainstorm. Nevertheless, wild turkeys certainly cannot read a calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25096","title":"State v.

Harris (\"Harris\"). We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn December 4,1995, Hughey forcibly entered Harris's house and had an altercation with his former girlfriend, Jackson. While Hughey and Jackson were arguing, Harris was on the phone with her son, Marcus Harris, from Oklahoma City. Harris told her son to call the police because Hughey had \r\na gun, so he immediately called 911. Harris also called the Abbeville City \r\nPolice Department to request help. While Harris was on the phone with the dispatcher, Hughey shot both Harris and Jackson with a shotgun. Harris \r\ndied from a solitary gunshot wound to the head. Jackson had three major \r\ninjuries: (1) a gunshot wound to the back of her head, from a maximum shooting \r\ndistance of two feet; (2) a large bruise on her face, likely caused by the blunt end \r\nof the shotgun; and (3) a stab wound in her chest.\r\nWithin thirty minutes of the shooting, Hughey stole Jackson's car and used her ATM card in Anderson. Hughey was arrested in Georgia and told \r\nthe authorities \"I killed them, it was an accident, the gun went off.\" Prior to \r\nthe incident, Hughey left a note on his door that stated: \"As of this morning I \r\nwill be dead. Love you all. Please take care of my kids. John K.\"\r\nAfter his arrest, Hughey gave an oral statement to Agent Eddie Clark. Hughey claimed he and Jackson had an altercation at Harris's house. According to Hughey, Jackson threw a vase at him and went outside to get \r\na shotgun from her car. Harris tried to get between Hughey and Jackson, grabbed the gun, and the gun accidentally fired. According to Hughey, \r\nJackson chased him into the bedroom, they struggled for the gun, and he \r\naccidentally shot her.\r\nHughey gave an inconsistent statement during the guilt phase of the \r\ntrial. He denied making the statement to the police after his arrest. At trial, \r\nHughey claimed Harris invited him in for coffee and Jackson attacked him \r\nwith a vase and a knife. According to Hughey, Jackson charged him with a knife and he pushed her resulting in a stab. Hughey then ran out of the house to get \r\nthe shotgun from the car. He claims that Jackson stood on the steps and threatened to kill him. As he approached her, Jackson spit on him and attempted to slam the door. While they struggled at the door, the gun went \r\noff and Harris was shot. Hughey admitted that he was angry and attempted to shoot at Jackson. He chased Jackson into the bedroom where he shot her in \r\nthe back of the head with a twenty gauge shotgun.\r\n\r\nOn March 11, 1996, Hughey was indicted in Abbeville County for: (1) the murder of Jackson; (2) the murder of Harris; (3) burglary in the first \r\ndegree; and (4) grand larceny of a vehicle. On October 27,1997, the jury found \r\nHughey guilty on all four counts. The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of all statutory aggravating circumstances and returned a recommendation of death for each count of murder. On October 30, 1997, \r\nthe trial judge sentenced Hughey to: (1) death for each count of murder; (2) a \r\nlife sentence for burglary in the first degree; and (3) ten years imprisonment \r\nfor grand larceny.\r\nHughey appeals his death sentence for both murders, raising the following issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Whether the trial judge erred by refusing to disqualify juror #55, Brian Daly (\"Daly\"), since he was employed at the McCormick Correctional Institution, and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-930 (1989) provides that \"[a]11 guards and officers employed at the Penitentiary shall be exempted from serving on a jury\", and whether Daly was the functional equivalent of a law enforcement officer?\r\n  (2) Whether the trial judge erred by refusing to provide specific examples of legal provocation in the jury charge of voluntary manslaughter?\r\n  (3) Whether the trial judge should have excluded the testimony of Mack Harris, the husband of Luevenia Harris, during the guilt phase concerning the blood he cleaned off the floor of his home after the murders?\r\n  (4) Whether the trial judge erred by refusing to charge the statutory mitigating circumstances contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(6) (Supp. 1998), which allows the jury to consider: (1) the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct; or (2) the defendant's ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law?\r\n  (5) Whether the trial judge erred by allowing the victim impact witnesses to testify in narrative form, rather than question-answer format, and whether this format was beyond the permissible scope of Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 115 L. \r\n    Ed.2d (1991)?\r\n  (6) Whether the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that a non statutory circumstance was \"one which the defendant contends serves the same purpose\" as a statutory mitigating circumstance?\r\n\r\n\r\n(7) Whether the trial judge erred in admitting State's Exhibit 95, a graphic color photograph of the victim's head wound?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. JUROR DISQUALIFICATION\r\nA. Exemption versus Disqualification\r\nHughey argues section 24-3-930 disqualifies a correctional officer from serving on a jury. We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes a difference between \"exemptions\" and \"disqualifications\" from jury duty. An exemption from jury duty is not a disqualification to act as a juror, but is a personal privilege that the \r\n  juror may claim or waive. 50A C.J.S. Juries Â§ 304 (1955); see also \r\n15A Words and Phrases Exempt; Exemption (1950) (\"A person exempted from jury services is \r\n  not thereby disqualified to serve on a jury.\"). This Court has held an \r\n  exemption from jury duty is not a disqualification. See State v. Matthews, 291 \r\n  S.C. 339, 343, 353 S.E.2d 444, 447 (1986) (\"An exemption under [S.C. Code Ann. \r\nÂ§14-7-850] is a privilege and not a disqualification.\"); State v. Toland, \r\n36 S.C. 515, 521,15 S.E. 599, 600 (1892) (\"exemption was a personal privilege which \r\n  (jurors] might or might not claim, but it did not disqualify them as jurors.\").\r\nS.C. CodeAnn. Â§ 24-3-930 (1976) provides \"that all guards orkeepers and other officers employed at the Penitentiary shall be exempted from \r\n  serving on juries and from military or street duty.\" (emphasis added). In drafting \r\n  this section, the South Carolina legislature chose the term \"exempted.\" However, in other code sections relating to juror qualification, the legislature chose \r\n  to use the term \"disqualifications.\" See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-430 \r\n  (1976) (\"Persons drawn shall serve unless dead, disqualified, or removed \r\n  from county\"); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-820 (1976) (\"Disqualification of county officers and court employees\"). The use of these separate terms in different sections \r\n  of the Code demonstrates the legislature's intent to draw a distinction between \r\nan exemption and a disqualification. Therefore, the trial judge did not err in \r\nruling that section 24-3-930 did not disqualify juror Daly.\r\n\r\nB. Disqualification under S.C. Code Â§ 14-7-820 (1976)\r\nHughey argues section 14-7-820 disqualifies a juror who considers himself to be a member of law enforcement. We disagree.\r\nSection 14-7-820 provides \"No clerk or deputy clerk of the court, \r\nconstable, sheriff, probate judge, county commissioner, magistrate or other county \r\nofficer or any person employed within the walls of any courthouse shall be eligible \r\nas a juryman in any civil or criminal case.\" \"This court has adopted a \r\nfunctional rather than a rigid formalistic approach in interpreting and applying the provisions of this statute.\" State v. Cooper, 291 S.C. 332, 334, 353 \r\nS.E.2d 441, 442 (1986). A juror's belief that he is the member of law enforcement is \r\nnot enough to disqualify him under this statute.\r\nThis Court held in State v. Johnson, 123 S.C. 50,115 S.E. 748 (1923) \r\nthat a juror would be disqualified under section 14-7-820 when he or she was \r\nvested with like powers and duties of a law enforcement officer. In Bryant v. \r\nState, 264 S.C. 157, 214 S.E.2d 451 (1975),we held that a special deputy sheriff who \r\ndid not perform the duties of a law enforcement officer was not disqualified \r\nunder the statute. Daly is a corrections officer whose duties do not involve \r\nenforcing the criminal laws of this State. Hughey offers no evidence that Daly \"was vested with like powers and duties of a . . . sheriff,\" Cooper, 291 \r\nS.C. at 334-335, 353 S.E.2d at 442. Hughey only argues that Daly's questionnaire indicates \r\nhe considered himself a member of law enforcement. In light of the fact that \r\nthe voir dire of Daly reveals no bias, Mr. Daly's subjective view of his \r\nemployment does not disqualify him under section 14-7-820. Furthermore, section \r\n24-3-930, discussed supra, speaks to the eligibility of an officer or guard \r\nemployed by the penitentiary for jury duty. Therefore, section 24-3-930, not section \r\n14-7-820, governs the eligibility of a corrections officer for jury duty.\r\nII. LEGAL PROVOCATION\r\nHughey argues the trial judge erred by refusing to provide specific \r\nfactual examples of legal provocation in the voluntary manslaughter charge. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina. Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 509 S.E.2d 286 (Ct. \r\nApp. 1998). The substance of the law must be charged to the jury, not particular \r\nverbiage. Keaton v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 \r\n(1999). A jury charge is correct if when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the \r\ncorrect definition and adequately covers the law. Id. at 495-96, 514 S.E.2d at 574. \r\nTo warrant reversal, a trial judge's refusal to give a requested jury charge \r\nmust be both erroneous and prejudicial. Ellison v. Parts Distributors, Inc., \r\n302 S.C. 299, 395 S.E.2d 740 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nThe trial judge's jury charge in the instant case is not reversible error because it adequately expressed the current South Carolina law of \r\nvoluntary manslaughter: \"Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.\" State \r\nv. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 508 S.E.2d 29 (1998). Both heat of passion and \r\nsufficient legal provocation must be present at the time of the killing to \r\nconstitute voluntary manslaughter. State v. Walker, 324 S.C. 257, 478 S.E.2d \r\n280 (1996) (citations omitted). The jury charge used in this case adequately expressed \r\nthe current law of voluntary manslaughter by incorporating the exact language used by this Court in State v. Walker to define \"sudden heat of \r\npassion.\" See Walker, 324 S. C. at 257, 478 S.E.2d at 281. The trial judge gave \r\nthe instruction as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sudden heat of passion aroused by sufficient legal provocation which may reduce a felonious killing from that of murder to that of manslaughter need not dethrone reason entirely or shut out knowledge and volition, but it refers to an unlawful killing provoked by such circumstances that would naturally disturb the sway of reason and render the mind of an ordinary, reasonable, and prudent person incapable of cool reflection. And to produce what, according to human experience may be called an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.\r\nNow in order for a felonious killing to be reduced from that of murder to that of manslaughter it must have occurred in sudden heat of passion aroused by sufficient legal provocation. The killing of a human being, even in the heat of passion, is murder if there was no sufficient legal provocation. That is the slayer had no reasonable cause for his anger.\r\nNow in connection with what I have just instructed you regarding a cool reflection, that is whether or not a reasonable time for cooling off had elapsed, you should consider the whole circumstances surrounding the event. You should consider the nature of the provocation, should you find some to exist, the defendant's mental and physical constitution as well as the circumstances and relationships between the parties, the time in which an ordinary person under like circumstances would have called - cooled off is considered to be the reasonable time.Even when a person's passion were sufficiently aroused by a legally adequate provocation, if at the time of the killing those passions had cooled or a sufficiently reasonable time had elapsed so that the passions of the ordinary reasonable person would have cooled, the killing would be murder and not manslaughter.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge's refusal to include the specific instructions requested \r\nby Hughey does not constitute reversible error. A trial judge's refusal to \r\nprovide specific jury instructions is not reversible error if the general \r\ninstructions are sufficiently broad to enable the jury to understand the law and the \r\nissues involved. Cohens, 333 S.C. at 345, 509 S.E.2d at 289. The failure to \r\nprovide specific jury instructions is not error when the given instructions use the \r\nproper test for determining the issues before the jury. Miller v. City of \r\nWest Columbia, 322 S.C. 224, 471 S.E.2d 683 (1996).\r\nHughey requested that specific examples of legal provocation be provided to the jury. Specifically, Hughey requested the following examples of \r\nlegal provocation: pulling a knife on a defendant, pointing a gun at a \r\ndefendant, spitting in a defendant's face, assault of a family member, sudden mutual combat where one of the participants is killed by the other without a \r\npreviously informed intention to do so, finding one's spouse in the act of adultery, or \r\nthe deceased having molested a defendant's minor child. The requested \r\nexamples constitute a direct charge on the facts because Hughey alleges that a knife \r\nwas pulled on him, Jackson spit in his face, and there was sudden mutual \r\ncombat. The requested jury charge elevates the specific facts of the case, such as \r\nspitting in a person's face, to an acceptable act of legal provocation. Because \r\nthe requested charge is an instruction on the facts, and the requested charge is \r\nfully and fairly covered by the trial judge's general charge, refusal of the \r\nrequested instruction is not reversible error. See State v. Barwick, 280 S.C. \r\n45, 310 S.E.2d 428 (1983).\r\n\r\nIII. PREJUDICIAL TESTIMONY\r\nHughey argues the trial judge erred in overruling their objection to a portion of George Harris's testimony. We disagree.\r\nAt trial, defense counsel objected to the following testimony by George Mack Harris, husband of one of the victims:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Question: When you got back in that house, did you notice \r\n    any red colored substance on the floor of your kitchen?\r\n  Mr. Garrett: Objection, Your Honor, relevance?\r\n  The Court: Overruled.\r\n  The Witness: When I got back in my house I cleaned that blood up, I (witness is crying) me and another friend. I removed all that blood. There was blood on the floor, blood down the hall in that door into that back bedroom, there was blood and fragments of bone on that floor. The police officers told me-\r\n  Mr. Garrett: Objection, Your Honor. As to what the police officers said.\r\n  Mr. Jones: Don't tell me what they told you, just tell \r\n    me-\r\n  The Court: The question is simply if you saw that on the floor or if it was there before you left?\r\n  Question: Was it on the floor before you left at 10:50?\r\n  Answer: No sir.\r\n  Question: Was it there when you came back?\r\n  Answer: Yes, it was.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense counsel objected to Mr. Harris's testimony on the grounds of relevance. The trial judge has considerable discretion in ruling on the admissibility of testimonial and non-testimonial evidence. See State v. \r\nDavis, 309 S.C. 326, 422 S.E.2d 133 (1992), overruled on othergrounds, Brightman \r\nv. State, Op. No. 24990 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Aug. 23,1999) (Shearouse \r\nAdv. Sh. No. 28 at 1); State v. Sims, 304 S.C.409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991). The trial \r\njudge's determination of admissibility will not be disturbed absent abuse of \r\ndiscretion resulting in prejudice to the complaining party. See, e.g., State v. \r\nBabb, 299 S.C. 451, 385 S.E.2d 827 (1989).\r\n\"Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish or makes more or less probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears.\" \r\nState v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1991). The State \r\nargues the testimony is relevant to the timing of the murder because it establishes that \r\nthe murder occurred during the period of time Mr. Harris was absent from his home. Even if we find the testimony was irrelevant, and the trial judge \r\nabused his discretion by admitting the testimony, the statements by Mr. Harris did \r\nnot result in unfair prejudice, and therefore, any error by the trial judge \r\nwas harmless. State v. Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991) \r\n(wife's testimony was not relevant, but admission was a harmless error).\r\nAlthough Mr. Harris's testimony may have been of little probative value, in light of the evidence already presented by the State, its admission did \r\nnot result in prejudice to the Appellant. In State v. Davis, supra, this \r\nCourt upheld the admission of testimony by the victim's mother where the testimony was \r\nof little probative value but concerned facts already known to the jury. The testimony by Mr. Harris in the instant case did not contain any evidence \r\nthat was not described, rather graphically, by the police, the pathologist, and \r\na SLED agent. This Court concluded in Davis that although the \r\ntestimony by the victim's mother was of little probative value, the testimony did not \r\nprejudice the defendant to the extent of affecting the outcome of the trial. Davis, \r\n309 S.C. at 340, 422 S.E.2d at 142.\r\nTherefore, even if the testimony of Mr. Harris was irrelevant and inadmissible, because the questionable testimony was brief and no new evidence was presented, the admission constituted a harmless error.\r\nIV. STATUTORY MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES\r\nHughey argues the trial judge erred by refusing to instruct the jury on \r\nthe statutory mitigating circumstance contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (C)(b)(6) (Supp.1998), which would allow the jury to consider Hughey's \r\ncapacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, or his ability to conform his \r\nconduct to the requirements of the law. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 16-3-20 (C)(b)(6) authorizes the trial judge to instruct the jury \r\non certain statutory mitigating circumstances that may be supported by \r\nevidence. Specifically, section 16-30-20 (C)(b)(6) states that the jury may consider \"[t]he capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or \r\nto conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially \r\nimpaired.\" The trial judge has a duty to review all statutory mitigating circumstances \r\nand instruct the jury as to any circumstances which may be supported by the evidence and not merely those requested by the defendant. State v. \r\nCaldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990) (citing State v. Bellamy, 293 \r\nS.C. 103, 359 S.E.2d 63 (1987)). In deciding which statutory mitigating circumstances \r\nmay be supported, the trial judge is concerned only with the existence of the evidence, not its weight. Id.\r\nHughey argues the trial judge should have instructed the jury to consider the statutory mitigating circumstances contained in section \r\n16-3-20(C)(b)(6) based on the following testimony provided by Dr. James Evans, a specialist \r\nin neuropsychology:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Question: You're offering them as explanations for his individual characteristics.\r\n  Answer: Yes, in a way I'm offering them as fact the [sic] \r\n    would appear to modify or mitigate or whatever the crime - it would - it wasn't - it might be something that - He's different from the average person in many ways. And those are the ways we've talked about now. And those certainly there is question whether they were factors - it needs to be asked are those factors in the crime. And they may well have been.\r\n  Question: In your opinion, they could definitely have impacted him on December 4, 1995?\r\n  Answer: They could have been factors, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Question: And, Doctor, in your medical opinion as neuropsychologist, if an individual who suffers from organic brain dysfunction is exposed to violence at an early age, abused, and then suffers a series of head traumas, in you opinion as an expert, would those factors affect that person's ability to cope and deal with stress and life itself?\r\n  Answer: Yes.\r\n  Question: And, Doctor, in your evaluation and study of \r\n    John Kennedy Hughey, have you found organic brain dysfunction?\r\n  Answer: I found a lot of converging evidence for organic \r\n    brain dysfunction to the point I would say, yes, it exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Evan's testimony implies that Hughey could not deal with stress, not \r\n  that Hughey would be unable to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law. In fact, no witness testified that Hughey \r\n  could not appreciate the criminality of his conduct.\r\nIn State v. Caldwell, this Court held the trial judge erred by \r\n  failing to charge the statutory mitigating circumstances contained in section 16-3-20(C)(b)(6) where the defendant suffered from a psychopathic personality. Caldwell, 300 S.C. at 506, 388 S.E.2d at 823. This condition is \"one \r\n  in which the individual is not constrained by societal norms for behavior and \r\n  therefore is unlikely to obey rules on his own.\" Id. The trial judge in Caldwell \r\nshould have charged section 16-3-20(C)(b)(6) because the defendant's disorder \r\n  caused him to be unable to appreciate the criminality of his behavior or abide by \r\n  the law. Unlike Caldwell, there is no evidence in the instant case that \r\n  Hughey's disorder caused him to be unable to understand the criminality of his \r\n  conduct, only that he was more susceptible to stress.\r\nHughey argues that he was entitled to an instruction on the mitigating circumstances in section 16-3-20(C)(b)(6) because of his abuse as a child, \r\n  several head traumas, a car accident, and the death of his mother. The trial \r\n  judge adequately submitted the issue of Hughey's mental well-being to the jury \r\n  by instructing the jury to consider as non-statutory mitigation, \"his level \r\n  of intellectual function whether as a natural consequence of his birth or as a \r\n  result of physical and/or emotional trauma suffered as a child or as an adult.\" \r\nSee State U. Plemmons, 296 S.C. 76, 370 S.E.2d, 871 (1988) \r\n(trial judge was not required to charge section 16-3-20 (C)(b)(6) because of the effects of \r\nalcohol on the defendant where the non-statutory mitigating circumstances charge specifically permitted the jury to consider the effects of \r\nintoxication).\r\n\r\nThe trial judge in the present case did not err by refusing to charge the statutory mitigating circumstances contained in section 16-3-20(C)(b)(6) because no evidence introduced supported it and the jury was advised to consider Hughey's mental state through the judge's non-statutory \r\nmitigating circumstances charge.\r\nV. VICTIM IMPACT TESTIMONY\r\nHughey argues the trial judge improperly allowed the State's victim impact witnesses to testify in narrative form rather than question-answer format in violation of Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 111 S. Ct. \r\n257, 115 L. Ed.2d 720 (1991).1 We \r\ndisagree.\r\nVictim impact evidence is admissible in the sentencing phase to demonstrate the \"uniqueness\" of the victim and the specific harm committed \r\nby the defendant. State v. Rocheville, 310 S.C. 20, 27, 425 S.E.2d. 32, \r\n36 (1993). In Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808,111 S. Ct. 257,115 L.Ed.2d 720 \r\n(1991), the United States Supreme Court held that victim impact evidence is relevant \r\nfor a jury to meaningfully assess the defendant's moral culpability and blameworthiness and is only inadmissible where it is so unduly prejudicial \r\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. See also State v. Johnson, \r\n306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d. 547 (1991). The State called four members of Harris's \r\nfamily to describe their personal relationship with Harris and the unique impact \r\nher death had on their lives. The solicitor asked each family member one open ended question that elicited a long, narrative response describing their relationship with the victim. Although given in narrative form, the \r\ntestimony was routine victim impact testimony that did not evoke any prejudicial comments.2 The \r\nwitnesses' testimony was relevant and proper because it portrayed Harris as an unique individual and it demonstrated the specific \r\nharm caused by Hughey's actions.3\r\n\r\nVI. NON-STATUTORY MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES\r\nHughey argues the trial judge's instruction on non-statutory mitigating circumstances constituted reversible error. We disagree.\r\nA jury instruction must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998) (citing Cupp \r\nv. Naughter, 414 U.S. 141, 94 S. Ct. 396, 38 L. Ed.2d 368). The test \r\nfor the sufficiency of a jury charge is what a reasonable juror would have \r\nunderstood the charge to mean. Id. at 218, 499 S.E.2d at 215. Hughey argues the jury charge was confusing to a reasonable juror because it implies that \r\nnon-statutory mitigating circumstances are not circumstances the law requires a \r\njury to consider. The trial judge gave the following instruction on non-statutory mitigating circumstances:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now you are also permitted under the law to consider. . .you should consider; any non-statutory mitigating circumstances which have been shown to exist by the evidence in the case.\r\n  A non-statutory mitigating circumstance is one which is not provided for by statute, but is one which the defendant contends serves the same purpose. That is to lessen or reduce the degree of the defendant's guilt in the commission of the crime of murder.\r\n  Those that the defense contends should be considered are: any prior good acts of the defendant, the defendant's level of intellectual functioning whether as a natural consequence of his birth or as a result of physical and/or emotional trauma suffered as a child or as an adult, and any other evidence relating to a mitigating circumstance which you find to be appropriate and which you find to have been established by the evidence in this case.\r\nNow while there must be some evidence which supports a finding by you of the existence of one or more statutory or non-statutory mitigating circumstances, it is not necessary that you find the existence or a circumstance or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. And you may recommend a sentence of life \r\nimprisonment and [sic] whether or not you find the existence of a statutory or \r\nnon statutory mitigating circumstance.In making your determination as to which sentence to recommend in these cases, you should consider the statutory aggravating circumstances, the statutory mitigating circumstances, and any non-statutory mitigating circumstances in arriving at your \r\ndecision... Simply stated, you may recommend a sentence of life imprisonment for any reason or for no reason at all other than as an act of mercy. \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nConsidering the jury charge as whole, a reasonable juror would understand that either a statutory or a non-statutory jury circumstance \r\ncould reduce the sentence to life imprisonment. Hughey contends the trial \r\njudge's instruction was erroneous because the charge defined non-statutory circumstances as those \"the defendant contends\" the jury should consider, \r\nnot what the law authorizes the jury to consider. The jury charge \r\nadequately apprised the jury of the function of non-statutory mitigating \r\ncircumstances because it repeatedly emphasized that both statutory and non-statutory circumstances should be considered when forming a recommendation. In \r\nfact, the judge instructed the jury that they could recommend life imprisonment \r\nfor \"any reason or no reason at all.\" See State v. Atkins, 303 S.C. 214, 399 \r\nS.E.2d 760 (1990) (upholding a jury charge where the judge stressed the \r\njury could recommend a life sentence \"for any reason or no reason\").\r\nMoreover, the jury charge in the present case is similar to other charges of non-statutory mitigating circumstances upheld by this Court. The jury charge authorized the jury to recommend life imprisonment even if they did \r\nnot find the existence of mitigating circumstances. Similar jury instructions \r\nhave been found adequate by this Court. See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, \r\n499 S.E.2d 209 (1998) (upholding a jury charge which permitted a jury to impose a \r\nlife sentence even if they did not find mitigating circumstances); State v. \r\nSims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991) (jury charge was found proper where it authorized jury to consider any mitigating evidence presented); State \r\nv. Singleton, 284 S.C. 388, 326 S.E.2d 284 (1985) (instruction proper \r\nwhere judge states the jury may consider \"any mitigating circumstances. . . which are supported by evidence.\"). Furthermore, the trial judge went beyond the \r\nbasic jury charge on non-statutory mitigating circumstances by providing \r\nspecific factual examples of non-statutory mitigating circumstances, such as the defendant's prior good acts and level of intellectual functioning.\r\n\r\nHughey contends the jury instruction was confusing because it suggested that an act of mercy would have been an invalid reason for a life vote. The \r\ntrial judge told the jurors \"you may recommend a sentence of life imprisonment \r\nfor any reason or no reason at all other than as an act of mercy.\" \r\n(emphasis added). This argument is without merit because a judge's charge that the jury \r\nshould not be guided by sympathy, prejudice, passion, or public opinion is not reversible error. See Singleton, 284 S.C. at 393, 326 S.E.2d at 156; \r\nState v. Chaffee, 285 S.C. 21, 328 S.E.2d 464 (1984).\r\nThe jury charge, reviewed in its entirety, is not confusing because it advises the jurors to consider all mitigating circumstance in making \r\ntheir recommendation. The non-statutory circumstances are repeatedly emphasized by the trial judge and are adequately defined according to current South Carolina case law.\r\nVII. PHOTOGRAPH\r\nHughey argues the trial judge erred in admitting State's Exhibit 95, a graphic color photograph of Jackson's head wound, because the photograph \r\nwas so inflammatory that it denied his right to a fair sentencing hearing. We disagree.\r\nThe relevancy, materiality, and admissibility of photographs are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and those rulings will not \r\nbe disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. State v. Nance, \r\n320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996); State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 350 \r\nS.E.2d 180 (1986). The trial judge must balance the prejudicial effect of graphic photographs against their probative value. To constitute unfair prejudice, \r\nthe photographs must create a \"tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.\" State v. \r\nFranklin, 318 S.C. 47, 55, 456 S.E.2d 357, 361(1995). Photographs which are \r\ncalculated to arouse the sympathies or prejudices of the jury should be excluded from \r\nthe guilt phase of a capital case if they are irrelevant or not substantially \r\nnecessary to show material facts or conditions. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. at 288, \r\n350 S.E.2d at 185.\r\n\r\nIn the sentencing phase, the scope of the probative value of evidence is much broader. State v. Rosemond, Op. No. 24975 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\nJuly 26, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 25 at 7). \"The purpose of the bifurcated proceeding in a capital case is to permit the introduction of evidence in \r\nthe sentencing proceeding which ordinarily would be inadmissible in the guilt phase.\" Id. During the sentencing phase, the trial judge may permit the introduction of additional evidence of aggravation in order to aid the jury \r\nin determining whether to recommend a death sentence. Id. Photographs of a victim's body in the sentencing phase are admissible to demonstrate: (1) \r\nthe circumstances of the crime; and (2) the character of the defendant. State \r\nv. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 168, 478 S.E.2d 260, 267 (1996).\r\nDuring the sentencing phase the State introduced a graphic photograph of the victim's face after she was shot in the back of the head with a \r\ntwenty gauge shotgun. Although the photograph is gruesome, it depicts the \r\ncondition in which Hughey left the victim and the circumstances of the crime. The photograph is probative of the circumstances of the crime because it demonstrates the shot was intentional rather than accidental. The defense argued in the guilt phase that the gun accidently fired when Hughey and Jackson were struggling over the gun. The photograph demonstrates that Jackson was shot deliberately from behind, in a manner in which she was \r\nleast able to defend herself, and not as a result of a struggle over the gun. \r\nThe photograph also demonstrates that Hughey shot Jackson at a very close \r\nrange. See Rosemond, Op. No. 24975 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 26, \r\n1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 25 at 7) (admitting a photograph of a victim who was shot twice \r\nin the head in order to demonstrate the wounds were inflicted at close \r\nrange); State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997) (admitting \r\nphotograph of victim's face because it demonstrated the angle and distance from which \r\nthe victim was shot); Tucker, 324 S.C. at 155, 478 S.E.2d at 267 \r\n(admitting photographs of victim's head to demonstrate the shots were fired at close range). Moreover, this Court has not found an abuse of discretion in the admission of graphic photographs similar to the photographs in the \r\npresent case. See State v. Gardner, 332 S.C. 389, 505 S.E.2d 338 (1998) \r\n(admitting a close-up color photograph of the victim's face in the sentencing phase of the \r\ntrial where she had been shot in the face five times).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude the death sentence was not the result of passion', prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the \r\njury's finding of statutory aggravating circumstances is supported by the \r\nevidence. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985). Further, the death penalty is \r\nneither excessive nor disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases. See \r\nState v.

In my opinion, the testimony from \r\nthe neuropsychologist coupled with the evidence of appellant's head traumas \r\nand his car accident constitute some evidence warranting a charge on the \r\nstatutory mitigating circumstance of capacity to appreciate the criminality of his \r\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. State v. \r\nCaldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990). Accordingly. I would reverse and \r\nremand for resentencing.\r\n\r\n1 Defense counsel adequately preserved this issue for appeal by objecting to the family members \"continuing without questions.\"\r\n2The family members testified that Harris was a good mother, they missed her company, they missed her cooking, and that the holidays were going to be painful without her.\r\n3 The family members' testimony in this case is similar to other victim impact testimony permitted by this Court. See State v. Ivey, 325 S.C. 137, 481 S.E.2d 125 (1997) (admitting testimony from victim's mother concerning the impact of her son's death); Riddle v. State, 314 S.C. 1, 443 S.E.2d 557 (1994) (admitting testimony of victim's stepdaughter concerning the victim's standing in the community, the victim's grandchildren, and the impact the crime had on her); State u.

Condon, \r\n                Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney \r\n                General Teresa A. Knox, and Assistant Attorney General J.

Reed Kimbrough, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for \r\n                respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J.: The State appeals the \r\nPost-Conviction Relief (\"PCR\") court's granting of a new trial to \r\nrespondent Frank Toomer (\"Defendant\"). We reverse the PCR court's grant \r\nto Defendant of a new trial.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1994, the State indicted Defendant for first \r\ndegree sexual conduct (\"CSC\"). The State based the indictment on \r\nalleged assaults by Defendant upon his daughter Deborah beginning in the \r\nsummer of 1971 when she was 11 years old. Deborah testified that the \r\nassaults continued from when she was 11 until she was 21. She stated the \r\nDefendant forced himself upon her and that the intercourse was not \r\nconsensual.\r\nAt trial, Defendant denied the allegations \r\nagainst him. He also testified that during the time the alleged \r\nassaults occurred, he suffered from a medical condition that would have prevented \r\nhim from committing the assaults.1 Defendant \r\nalso testified about a business dispute between himself and his children over the family's fishing \r\nboats. Defense counsel argued this business dispute motivated the \r\naccusations.\r\nAfter presenting its case, the State amended the \r\nindictment to change the CSC charge to Rape. Prior to charging the \r\njury, the trial court informed counsel that it planned to give the following \r\njury charge:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Force and resistance need not be established if \r\n    the victim is under the age of consent. An underaged female is \r\n    deemed to be legally incapable of giving consent. In a case \r\n    involving a rape committed by a father upon his daughter, \r\n    physical resistance is not required. Submission the compulsion of \r\n    parental command is sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant's attorney stated that he believed the \r\ncharge was \"an accurate statement of the law.\" After the close of \r\nargument, the judge actually charged the jury:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The elements of Rape include carnal knowledge of \r\n    a female, the use of force by the male, an intent \r\n    to have intercourse, and the lack of consent by the \r\n    victim. When the female is under the age of 14 years and \r\n    unmarried the only other element necessary to prove - to be proven in \r\n    order to establish the crime of Rape is the fact the defendant had \r\n    sexual intercourse with her. Where the female is \r\n    under the age of consent force and resistance are immaterial \r\n    and not necessarily - not necessary to constitute the \r\n    offense.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Defense counsel did not object \r\nto the charge as given.\r\nThe jury found Defendant guilty of Rape. The \r\ntrial judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison. Defendant did not \r\ndirectly appeal either his conviction or sentence. Defendant filed a PCR \r\napplication on July 19, 1997, alleging lack of jurisdiction and ineffective \r\nassistance of counsel. At the PCR hearing, Defendant testified for himself along \r\nwith two other witnesses. The State presented the testimony of Charles \"Mike\" Macloskie, Defendant's attorney during his trial.\r\nOn May I1, 1998, the PCR court issued an order \r\ngranting Defendant a new trial. The PCR court determined that \r\nDefendant's counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial \r\ncourt's jury charge that it was unnecessary for the jury to find Defendant used \r\nforce if it found the victim was under the age of 14. The PCR court's order \r\nstates:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In my view, the jury charge was incorrect and \r\n    the failure to object by trial counsel was ineffective \r\n    assistance. The element of force is necessary to convict the Defendant of \r\n    Rape. Had the indictment been for Statutory Rape, then force \r\n    would not have been a necessary element. The charge to the jury \r\n    that it could convict Toomer without finding force was highly \r\n    prejudicial and his counsel was ineffective in not objecting to \r\n    the charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State appealed the PCR court's order and the \r\nissue before the Court is:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR court err in finding Counsel was \r\n    ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's jury \r\n    charge on Rape?2\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe State argues the jury charge given at trial \r\n  was a correct statement of the law, and therefore, no error occurred. We \r\n  agree.\r\nThe PCR court erred in holding the element of \r\n  force is necessary to convict a defendant of Rape where the victim was \r\n  under 14 years of age. Under South Carolina law, \"Where the female is \r\n  under the age of fourteen and unmarried, the only other element necessary \r\n  to be proven in order to establish the crime of Rape is the fact that the \r\n  defendant had sexual intercourse with her.\" State v. Whitener, \r\n228 S.C. 244, 274, 89 S.E.2d 701, 716 (1955). In Whitener, the State \r\n  charged the defendant with both common law Rape under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-71(1952) and \r\n  Carnal Knowledge of a Woman Child under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-80 \r\n  (1952)(commonly referred to as Statutory Rape). Whitener argued that force was \r\n  a necessary ingredient of the crime of common law Rape where the girl is \r\n  under the age of 14 years. This Court disagreed and \r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The same reasoning whereby in the case of sexual \r\n      intercourse with a woman who is unconscious or insane, the \r\n      elements of force and resistance are held to be immaterial, \r\n      or conclusively presumed, to be immaterial, or conclusively \r\n      presumed, with a female who is under the age of consent. In one \r\n      case physically, in the other as a matter of law, she is \r\n      incapable of consenting. Since evidence of consent, even if admissible, \r\n      cannot avail as a defense against the charge of rape where the \r\n      female is under the age of consent, it is manifest that in such case \r\n      neither force on the part of the male nor resistance on her part \r\n      is an essential ingredient of the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitener, 228 S.C. at 273, 89 S.E.2d at \r\n  716. Based on this reasoning, the Court upheld Whitener's Rape conviction where \r\n  his victim was younger than 14 years old and the jury did not have to find \r\n  the element of force or lack of consent.\r\nDefendant argues his situation is \r\n  distinguishable from Whitener because he was charged only with Rape under \r\n  Section 16-71 and not Carnal Knowledge of a Woman Child under Section 16-80. \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, applying \r\n  South Carolina law, correctly rejected an argument identical to \r\nDefendant's in Griffin v. Aiken, 775 F.2d 1266 (4th Cir. 1985). In Griffin, the defendant argued that he was charged with Rape but was effectively convicted \r\nof Statutory Rape because the trial judge did not charge the jury that it \r\nhad to find the element of force or the unmarried status of the victim in order \r\nto convict. The Fourth Circuit held:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Because section 16-71 [common law Rape] is \r\n    subject to Article III, section 33 of the 1962 South Carolina \r\n    Constitution which provides that an unmarried woman under the age \r\n    of fourteen is incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse, \r\n    the South Carolina Supreme Court has held that for purposes of \r\n    proving rape the prosecution need only show that the defendant \r\n    had sexual intercourse with a female under the age of \r\n    fourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 1231 (citing State v. Haddon, 49 \r\nS.C. 308, 27 S.E. 194, 197 (1896)). The Fourth Circuit also noted that \"Although the \r\nelements of the two crimes [Section 16-71 and Section 16-80] are similar \r\nwhen the victim is under fourteen years of age, the two offenses are \r\nseparate and distinct.\" Id. While under Section 16-80, a defendant may be \r\nconvicted of Statutory Rape merely upon proof that he had sexual intercourse with a \r\nfemale under the age of 16, Section 16-71 requires proof of an act of \r\nintercourse and proof that such act was performed by force or without the victim's \r\nconsent. Id. (citing State v. Whitener, 228 S.C. 244, 89 S.E.2d \r\n701(1955)). Since women under the age of 14 cannot legally give consent, the additional \r\nrequirement of force or lack of consent is satisfied by showing that the victim \r\nwas under the statutory age of 14 when the intercourse \r\noccurred.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we REVERSE the PCR \r\ncourt's grant of a new trial.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., \r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n1 Defendant testified that prior to 1971 he had contracted a case of the mumps and failed to follow his doctor's advice. Defendant testified that this mistake rendered him impotent during the time the alleged assaults occurred.\r\n2We note that Defendant did not appeal the denial of a new trial based on his other issues. These other issues are therefore final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
