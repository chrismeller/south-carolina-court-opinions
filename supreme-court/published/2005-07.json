Clare, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Henry\r\n        Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh,\r\n        Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant\r\n        Attorney General Julie M. Thames, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:&nbsp;\r\nPetitioner was indicted for murder and second degree arson after he stabbed his\r\nmother to death and burned her house.&nbsp; At trial, petitioner raised an\r\ninsanity defense and presented medical testimony that he was paranoid\r\nschizophrenic.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict of guilty but mentally ill (GBMI).&nbsp;\r\nWe granted a belated review of petitionerâ€™s direct appeal issue pursuant to White\r\nv. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974), and now affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBefore trial, defense counsel\r\nrequested that petitioner be evaluated for competency to stand trial as provided\r\nin S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-23-410 (2002).&nbsp; In ordering the competency exam,\r\nthe trial judge used a form order indicating petitioner should also be examined\r\nfor criminal responsibility although this was not requested.&nbsp;\r\nDrs. Berg and Lewis examined\r\npetitioner and concluded he was competent to stand trial but not criminally\r\nresponsible for his actions at the time of the offense.&nbsp; The State then\r\nrequested that petitioner be examined for criminal responsibility by its own\r\nexpert, Dr. Price.&nbsp; Petitioner objected on the ground Â§ 44-23-410 does not\r\nallow an additional evaluation.&nbsp; Over petitionerâ€™s objection, the trial\r\njudge allowed petitioner to be examined by Dr. Price in the presence of defense\r\ncounsel.&nbsp; The trial judge specified that the evidence resulting from the\r\nStateâ€™s examination would be admissible only in reply at trial.&nbsp;\r\nAt trial, petitioner conceded he\r\nkilled his mother but contended he was insane, or not criminally responsible, at\r\nthe time of the offense.&nbsp; Dr. Berg, who conducted petitionerâ€™s original\r\nevaluation, testified for the defense that in her opinion, petitioner was not\r\ncriminally responsible because at the time of the offense he was suffering from\r\nthe delusion that his mother was going to kill him.&nbsp; In reply, Dr. Price\r\ntestified that petitionerâ€™s contrition and attempts to cover up his crime were\r\nsigns of sanity.&nbsp; Dr. Price concluded petitioner was criminally responsible\r\nbecause he was able to distinguish right from wrong and was able to conform his\r\nconduct to the requirements of the law.&nbsp; The trial judge charged both\r\ninsanity and GBMI.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict of GBMI.&nbsp;\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial judge err in\r\n  allowing the Stateâ€™s expert to examine petitioner on the issue of criminal\r\n  responsibility?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner contends it was error for\r\nthe trial judge to allow the Stateâ€™s expert to examine him for criminal\r\nresponsibility because Â§ 44-23-410 does not provide for an additional\r\nexamination and there is no statutory authority allowing it.&nbsp;\r\nSection 44-23-410 does not apply to\r\nevaluations for criminal responsibility; it governs only evaluations to\r\ndetermine competency to stand trial.[1]&nbsp; These are separate mental health issues.&nbsp; The test for\r\ncriminal responsibility relates to the time of the alleged offense, while\r\ncompetency to stand trial relates to the time the defendant is before the court\r\nfor trial.&nbsp; State v. Lee, 274 S.C. 372, 375, 264 S.E.2d 418, 419\r\n(1980).&nbsp; Accordingly, even if Â§ 44-23-410 allows only one examination, it\r\nis not dispositive here.\r\nThe trial judge has the discretion\r\nto order a mental health evaluation where the defendant indicates an intent to\r\nintroduce evidence at trial that he lacked criminal responsibility.&nbsp; State\r\nv. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000); see also State\r\nv. Myers, 220 S.C. 309, 67 S.E.2d 506 (1951) (where insanity is interposed\r\nas a defense, compulsory examination to determine defendantâ€™s mental condition\r\ndoes not violate self-incrimination or due process provisions).&nbsp; We find no\r\nabuse of discretion here.&nbsp; Although petitioner was examined twice, only one\r\nexamination was at the Stateâ€™s request after it became apparent petitioner\r\nintended to proceed with an insanity defense.&nbsp; There is no evidence the\r\nState was engaging in â€œopinion shoppingâ€ by requesting another expert\r\nevaluation.&nbsp; Evidence from the Stateâ€™s examination was introduced at\r\ntrial in fair response to evidence of the initial evaluation in petitionerâ€™s\r\nfavor.\r\nWe find the trial judge did not err\r\nin ordering an evaluation by the Stateâ€™s expert.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Section 44-23-410 provides:\r\n\r\n  Whenever a judge of the Circuit\r\n  Court or Family Court has reason to believe that a person on trial before him,\r\n  charged with the commission of a criminal offense or civil contempt, is not\r\n  fit to stand trial because the person lacks the capacity to understand the\r\n  proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense as a result of a lack\r\n  of mental capacity, the judge shall: [order examination as provided].\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26008","title":"Treece v.

Crum, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:&nbsp;\r\nPetitioner pled guilty but mentally ill on February 7, 1994, to two counts of\r\nsecond degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) and one count of first degree sexual\r\nexploitation of a minor.&nbsp; The charges stemmed from petitionerâ€™s sexual\r\nactivity with his fourteen-year-old stepdaughter which he videotaped.&nbsp; We\r\ngranted a writ of certiorari to review the denial of post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\nand now affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt petitionerâ€™s plea hearing,\r\ncounsel informed the judge that the sexual exploitation statute, S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 16-15-395 (Supp. 2004), mandates a consecutive sentence to other\r\ncharges.&nbsp; Petitioner was sentenced to twenty years on one count of CSC,\r\nsuspended upon service of fifteen years with five years probation; fifteen years\r\non the second count of CSC; and fifteen years on the sexual exploitation\r\ncharge.&nbsp; The plea judge did not specify whether the sentences were to run\r\nconsecutively or concurrently.\r\nAfter sentencing, petitioner was\r\nadvised by his caseworker at the Department of Corrections (DOC) that his\r\nsentences were concurrent and he was serving a fifteen-year term.&nbsp; His\r\nprojected max-out date was September 11, 2001.&nbsp; In December 1999, however,\r\npetitionerâ€™s caseworker informed petitioner that his sentence for sexual\r\nexploitation was to run consecutively and not concurrently, adding five years to\r\nhis max-out date which was now projected to be August 16, 2006.&nbsp; Although\r\npetitioner filed a grievance, DOC refused to change his classification.&nbsp;\r\nPetitioner then filed this action.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Is petitionerâ€™s sentence for\r\n  sexual exploitation to run concurrently or consecutively?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe PCR court found that DOC\r\nproperly calculated petitionerâ€™s sentence for sexual exploitation as\r\nconsecutive under Â§ 16-15-395.[1]&nbsp;\r\nThis section provides for a sentence of three to twenty years for sexual\r\nexploitation of a minor with the additional provision that:&nbsp; â€œ[s]entences\r\nimposed pursuant to this section must run consecutively with and commence at the\r\nexpiration of another sentence being served by the person sentenced.â€&nbsp;\r\nIt is well-settled that sentences\r\nare deemed to run concurrently â€œunless the intention that one should begin at\r\nthe end of the other is expressed.â€&nbsp; Finley v. State, 219 S.C.\r\n278, 282, 64 S.E.2d 881, 882 (1954).&nbsp; This rule of construction has never\r\nbeen applied, however, where the legislature has mandated a consecutive sentence\r\nfor a particular offense.&nbsp; In fact, we have recognized that â€œ[j]udicial\r\ndiscretion in . . . determining that sentences run concurrent or consecutive is\r\nsubject to statutory restriction.â€&nbsp; State v. De La Cruz, 302 S.C.\r\n13, 15, 393 S.E.2d 184, 186 (1990).&nbsp; Under Â§ 16-15-395, the plea judge had\r\nno authority to order anything but a consecutive sentence for the sexual\r\nexploitation charge.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES,\r\nJJ., concur.&nbsp; BURNETT, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1]Although this issue should have been appealed to the Administrative\r\nLaw Court as provided in Al-Shabazz v.

Barker, of Bethea, Jordan \r\n        &amp; Griffin, P.A., of Hilton Head Island, for\r\n        respondent/appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:&nbsp; Both\r\nparties have appealed the trial courtâ€™s order in this action concerning the\r\nconstruction of a house.&nbsp; This matter was certified from the Court of\r\nAppeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1998, respondent/appellant,\r\nSmith-Hunter Construction Company (Builder), filed an affidavit of mechanicâ€™s\r\nlien and a complaint.&nbsp; The complaint arose from Builderâ€™s construction of\r\na residence for appellants/respondents (Homeowners) for the amount of\r\n$828,363.&nbsp; The complaint set forth three causes of action:&nbsp; (1)\r\nforeclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien; (2) breach of contract; and (3) quantum\r\nmeruit.&nbsp; Homeowners also filed a complaint asserting various breaches\r\nof the contract and defective construction by Builder.&nbsp; The two lawsuits\r\nwere consolidated for trial without a jury.\r\nIn its first order, the trial court\r\nentered judgment on behalf of Builder in a total amount of $209,337.90.&nbsp;\r\nAfter a hearing on Homeownersâ€™ Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the\r\njudgment, the court issued a revised order that reduced the judgment against\r\nHomeowners from $209,337.90 to $199,028.48.&nbsp; The court reversed its\r\nprevious ruling that Builder was entitled to recover for the amount representing\r\n13% of the cost of the roof that was placed on the residence and the amount\r\nrepresenting 13% of the cost of Arrow Roofing labor in placing the roof on the\r\nresidence.&nbsp; Builder then made a Rule 59(e) motion that was denied.&nbsp;\r\nBoth parties appeal the courtâ€™s order.\r\nHomeownersâ€™ Appeal\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err by\r\n  awarding prejudgment interest to Builder?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe trial court found Builder was\r\nentitled to recover $73,117 in actual damages and also found Builder was\r\nentitled to $26,397.24 in prejudgment interest.&nbsp; Homeowners argue the award\r\nof prejudgment interest was in error because the trial court had to review the\r\nfacts and determine if the amount claimed by Builder was reasonable given that\r\nall of the underlying amounts for work completed were not represented by written\r\nand signed change orders.&nbsp; Homeowners argue prejudgment interest could not\r\nbe awarded because the amount owed to Builder was neither a sum certain nor\r\ncapable of being reduced to a sum certain.\r\nThe law allows prejudgment interest\r\non obligations to pay money from the time when, either by agreement of the\r\nparties or operation of law, the payment is demandable and if the sum is certain\r\nor capable of being reduced to certainty.&nbsp; Babb v. Rothrock, 310\r\nS.C. 350, 426 S.E.2d 789 (1993).&nbsp; The fact that the sum due is disputed\r\ndoes not render the claim unliquidated for the purposes of an award of\r\nprejudgment interest.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The proper test for determining whether prejudgment\r\ninterest may be awarded is whether or not the measure of recovery, not\r\nnecessarily the amount of damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time\r\nthe claim arose.&nbsp; Id.\r\nWe find the trial court properly\r\nawarded prejudgment interest because the amount owed to Builder is â€œcapable of\r\nbeing reduced to a sum certain.â€&nbsp; The measure of recovery was fixed by\r\nconditions existing at the time the claim arose.&nbsp; The costs of the work\r\ncompleted by Builder at the time of Homeownersâ€™ breach of contract were\r\nestablished via Builderâ€™s invoices.[1]&nbsp;\r\nBuilder was also entitled to 13% in profits and overhead on the jobs completed.[2]&nbsp; The mere fact that Homeowners\r\ndisagreed with Builder regarding the amounts, which were stated in the invoices,\r\nrepresenting completed work did not preclude an award of prejudgment\r\ninterest.&nbsp; The trial court did not err by awarding prejudgment interest\r\nbecause the measure of recovery was fixed by conditions existing at the time the\r\nclaim arose.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not err\r\nby awarding prejudgment interest to Builder.&nbsp; Regarding Homeownersâ€™\r\nremaining issues, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:&nbsp; Issue II:&nbsp; Food Mart v. South Carolina Depâ€™t\r\nof Health and Envtâ€™l Control, 322 S.C. 232, 471 S.E.2d 688 (1996) (matters\r\nnot argued to or ruled on by trial court are not preserved for review); S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (Supp. 2004) (costs which may arise in enforcing\r\nmechanicâ€™s lien, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee, may be recovered by\r\nprevailing party; fee and court costs may not exceed the lien amount); Issue\r\nIII:&nbsp; Food Mart, supra (matters not argued to or ruled on\r\nby trial court are not preserved for review); Issue IV:&nbsp; Food\r\nMart, supra (matters not argued to or ruled on by trial court are not\r\npreserved for review); Trico Surveying, Inc. v. Godley Auction Co., Inc.,\r\n314 S.C. 542, 431 S.E.2d 565 (1993) (attorneyâ€™s fee award affirmed where\r\nattorney provided detailed affidavit itemizing time and expenses and where court\r\nconsidered factors requisite to award of attorneyâ€™s fees); Baron Data Sys.,\r\nInc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 (1989) (amount of attorneyâ€™s\r\nfees to be awarded in particular case is within trial courtâ€™s discretion).\r\nRegarding Builderâ€™s appeal, we\r\naffirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:&nbsp; Columbia\r\nWholesale Co., Inc. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 440 S.E.2d 129 (1994)\r\n(elements of quantum meruit are:&nbsp; (1) benefit conferred upon\r\ndefendant by plaintiff; (2) realization of that benefit by defendant; and (3)\r\nretention by defendant of benefit under conditions that make it unjust for him\r\nto retain it without paying its value); Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc.,\r\n301 S.C. 229, 391 S.E.2d 538 (1989) (while Court may review evidence to\r\ndetermine facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence, Court does not disregard Masterâ€™s findings, who saw and heard\r\nwitnesses and was in better position to evaluate their credibility).&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Homeowners argue the invoices and memos representing work completed\r\nby Builder at the time of wrongful termination were not â€œchange ordersâ€ as\r\ncontemplated by the contract.&nbsp; However, as the trial court correctly noted,\r\nwhile these documents did not comply with the contract by not being signed by\r\nboth parties and setting forth the resulting adjustments in contract price and\r\ncompletion date, Homeowners had waived those provisions of the contract.&nbsp; See\r\nT.W.

Wilson, Jr., of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:&nbsp;\r\nFollowing a juryâ€™s finding that appellant (BB&amp;T) was grossly negligent in\r\nits conduct regarding an automobile loan, BB&amp;T appealed on the basis the\r\ntrial court erred by failing to give a requested instruction to the jury.&nbsp;\r\nWe certified this matter from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\nSCACR.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err by\r\n  refusing to charge the jury the law of independent contractor?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nIn July 1996, respondent financed\r\nthe purchase of a car with a loan from United Carolina Bank, which subsequently\r\nmerged into BB&amp;T.&nbsp; In May 1999, respondent made a full cash payment for\r\nthe month; however, the payment was improperly entered as a partial\r\npayment.&nbsp; BB&amp;T claimed respondent owed the bank $23.76.&nbsp; Based on\r\nBB&amp;Tâ€™s own error, BB&amp;T began collection efforts against\r\nrespondent.&nbsp; Respondent continued to make regular payments, but then ceased\r\npayments in October 1999, due to BB&amp;Tâ€™s collection efforts and its\r\ninability to give him a correct pay-off figure.\r\nBB&amp;T referred the collection\r\nmatter to an outside attorney.&nbsp; In negotiations with BB&amp;Tâ€™s attorney\r\n(Attorney), respondentâ€™s attorney attempted to establish a correct pay-off\r\nfigure and sought to have BB&amp;T correct the error on his credit report.&nbsp;\r\nWhen the attorneys could not reach a final agreement, BB&amp;T commenced an\r\naction against respondent.\r\nMeanwhile, respondent entered into a\r\nreal estate contract to purchase a parcel of land with commercial\r\npotential.&nbsp; The purchase price for the parcel was $122,000; however, it\r\nappraised at $210,000. &nbsp;Respondent lost the real estate deal due to\r\nBB&amp;Tâ€™s credit reporting error.&nbsp; After the real estate deal was lost,\r\nnegotiations essentially ceased between the two attorneys and respondent filed\r\ncounterclaims of libel, conversion, breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent\r\nintent, and gross negligence against BB&amp;T.&nbsp; On behalf of BB&amp;T,\r\nAttorney moved for summary judgment.&nbsp; The trial court granted summary\r\njudgment on both BB&amp;Tâ€™s claims and respondentâ€™s counterclaims in an\r\norder prepared by Attorney.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals reversed the courtâ€™s\r\norder and stated respondent was never afforded an opportunity to argue the\r\nmerits of his counterclaims.&nbsp; BB&amp;T f/k/a United Carolina Bank v.\r\nKoutsogiannis, Op. No. 2003-UP-175 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 4, 2003).&nbsp; Thereafter, respondent paid off\r\nthe car loan and a jury trial was conducted on the counterclaims.\r\nAt trial, respondent sought to\r\nrecover damages from BB&amp;T based on BB&amp;Tâ€™s misconduct in handling the\r\nloan matter and vicarious liability for Attorneyâ€™s misconduct in attempting to\r\ncollect the debt and preparing the draft order for summary judgment.&nbsp; As to\r\nAttorney, respondent asserted Attorney engaged in dilatory tactics which\r\nintentionally prolonged the unsuccessful settlement negotiations.&nbsp; With\r\nrespect to the preparation of the summary judgment order, respondent asserted\r\nAttorney intentionally sought to deceive the trial court and injure respondent.\r\nBB&amp;T requested a charge on the\r\nlaw of independent contractor.[1]&nbsp;\r\nBB&amp;Tâ€™s theory was that even if Attorneyâ€™s conduct could be considered\r\nwrongful, he was, nonetheless, an independent contractor for whose misconduct\r\nBB&amp;T was not vicariously liable. &nbsp;The request for the charge was\r\ndenied; however, the trial court gave a detailed and extensive charge on the law\r\nof agency to the jury.&nbsp; The court further charged that the â€œacts of an\r\nattorney are directly attributable and binding upon the client.â€\r\nAt trial, Attorney testified he was\r\npaid by BB&amp;T on a case-by-case basis and that BB&amp;T did not supervise him\r\nor instruct him as to how he should handle the\r\ncase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sonja Allen, a BB&amp;T employee who\r\nAttorney was required to report to regarding respondentâ€™s case, testified\r\nAttorney was a private lawyer who was sent cases by BB&amp;T on a case-by-case\r\nbasis.&nbsp; Allen stated she did not supervise Attorney in the sense that he\r\nwas instructed on what methods to use to collect the debt.&nbsp; Allen stated\r\nAttorney kept her informed of significant events in the case.&nbsp; She stated\r\nshe was aware there had been a summary judgment hearing and that Attorney had\r\nsubmitted documents for her approval before and after the hearing.&nbsp; She\r\nstated she would have reviewed the proposed summary judgment order prepared by\r\nAttorney.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor\r\nof respondent on the counterclaim of gross negligence and awarded respondent\r\n$98,000.[2]&nbsp; The jury found in\r\nfavor of BB&amp;T on the other counterclaims.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBB&amp;T argues that because a\r\nclient may not be vicariously liable for the conduct of its attorney, the trial\r\ncourt erred by failing to charge the jury on the law of independent\r\ncontractor.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe trial judge is required to\r\ncharge the current and correct law.&nbsp; McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C.\r\n301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995).&nbsp; Where a request to charge is timely made and\r\ninvolves a controlling legal principle, a refusal by the trial judge to charge\r\nthe request constitutes reversible error.&nbsp; Eaddy v. Jackson Beauty\r\nSupply Co., 244 S.C. 256, 136 S.E.2d 297 (1964).&nbsp; To warrant reversal,\r\nthe refusal to give a requested charge must have been erroneous and\r\nprejudicial.&nbsp; Jones v. Ridgely Communications, Inc., 304 S.C. 452,\r\n405 S.E.2d 402 (1991).&nbsp; In determining prejudice, a charge to the jury\r\nshould be considered in its entirety.&nbsp; Id.\r\nThe proper focus here is whether\r\nAttorney was acting within the scope of his representation when he committed the\r\nalleged acts of gross negligence.&nbsp; In the attorney-client relationship,\r\nclients are generally bound by their attorneysâ€™ acts or omissions during the\r\ncourse of the legal representation that fall within the apparent scope of their\r\nattorneysâ€™ authority.&nbsp; See, e.g., Shelton v. Bressant, 312\r\nS.C. 183, 439 S.E.2d 833 (1993) (client bound by attorneyâ€™s actions in\r\nsettlement of a case; acts of attorney are directly attributable to and binding\r\nupon client); Shuler v. Crook, 290 S.C. 538, 351 S.E.2d 862 (1986)\r\n(clients penalized because frequent change of counsel added to other partiesâ€™\r\ncost in defending the case; acts of attorney are directly attributable to and\r\nbinding upon client).&nbsp; Attorney was an agent for BB&amp;T because the work\r\nand acts he engaged in, such as the settlement negotiations and the submission\r\nof a proposed summary judgment order to the trial court, were within the scope\r\nof his representation.&nbsp; Cf. BB&amp;T of South Carolina v. Fleming,\r\n360 S.C. 341, 345, 601 S.E.2d 540, 542 (2004) (in another case, we held that\r\nbecause this specific attorney was BB&amp;Tâ€™s attorney of record, he was\r\nBB&amp;Tâ€™s agent).&nbsp; As a result, BB&amp;T can be held liable for its\r\nagentâ€™s, Attorneyâ€™s, actions taken within his scope of representation,\r\nincluding possible torts committed by him.[3]&nbsp;\r\nSee Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 468\r\nS.E.2d 292 (1996) (doctrine of apparent authority provides principal bound by\r\nagentâ€™s acts when principal has placed agent in such position that persons of\r\nordinary prudence, reasonably knowledgeable with business usages and customs,\r\nare led to believe agent has certain authority and they in turn deal with agent\r\nbased on that assumption).&nbsp; Therefore, the trial court did not err by\r\nfailing to charge the law of independent contractor and charging only the law of\r\nagency.[4]&nbsp; See Jones\r\nv. Ridgely Communications, Inc., supra (refusal to give requested\r\ncharge must have been erroneous and prejudicial).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Attorneyâ€™s engagement in\r\nsettlement negotiations and in the preparation of the proposed summary judgment\r\norder is clearly within the scope of authority set out to him by BB&amp;T.&nbsp;\r\nAny misconduct engaged in by Attorney during those actions is directly\r\nattributable to BB&amp;T.&nbsp; See Shuler v. Crook, supra\r\n(acts of attorney are directly attributable to and binding upon client).&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err by refusing to charge the jury the law\r\nof independent contractor.&nbsp; See McCourt v. Abernathy, supra\r\n(trial court is required to charge correct law); Jones v. Ridgely\r\nCommunications, Inc., supra (refusal to give requested charge must\r\nhave been erroneous and prejudicial to warrant reversal).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, J.J.\r\nand Acting Justice Kenneth G. Goode, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The requested charge is as follows:\r\n\r\n  The principalâ€™s or masterâ€™s\r\n  liability is derived from his or her relationship to the agent, or\r\n  servant.&nbsp; A master is one who has the right to control the manner and\r\n  method of work performed.&nbsp; A servant is one whose work is subject to the\r\n  supervision or control of the master.&nbsp; By contrast, an independent\r\n  contractor is a person hired for a particular purpose or project, who is\r\n  compensated on a project-by-project basis, and who exercises his own\r\n  discretion over the manner and method of carrying out the work.\r\n\r\n[2]It cannot be determined from the jury verdict whether the jury\r\nfound in favor of respondent on the counterclaim of gross negligence due to\r\nBB&amp;Tâ€™s own negligence or due to Attorneyâ€™s negligence.\r\n[3]We have previously held that an action may not be maintained\r\nagainst an attorney for actions taken in the attorneyâ€™s professional capacity;\r\nhowever, an attorney is not immune for acts taken outside the scope of\r\nthe professional relationship.&nbsp; See Stiles v. Onorato, 318\r\nS.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 601 (1995) (attorney may be held liable for conspiracy\r\nwhere, in addition to representing his client, he breaches some independent duty\r\nto third person or acts in own personal interest, outside scope of\r\nrepresentation of client); Douglass ex rel. Louthian v. Boyce, 344 S.C.\r\n5, 542 S.E.2d 715 (2001) (attorney immune from liability to third persons\r\narising from attorneyâ€™s professional activities on behalf and with knowledge\r\nof client, absent independent duty to third party).\r\n[4]This result is supported by other jurisdictions which have found\r\nclients to be vicariously liable for their attorney agentsâ€™ wrongful acts\r\ncommitted within the scope of the attorneysâ€™ representation.&nbsp; See Southwestern\r\nBell Tel. Co. v. Wilson, 768 S.W.2d 755 (Tex. App. 1988) (creditor\r\nvicariously liable for alleged tortious collection efforts of its attorneys for\r\nits benefit; relationship between client and attorney was agency relationship); Peterson\r\nv. Worthen Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A., 753 S.W.2d 278 (Ark. 1988) (client\r\ncould be held accountable for acts of attorney, who used successive garnishments\r\nto collect clientâ€™s judgment, so long as attorney was acting within scope of\r\nemployment, even though client may not have directed attorney or affirmatively\r\nacquiesced in attorneyâ€™s conduct); Hewes v. Wolfe, 330 S.E.2d 16 (N.C.\r\nApp. 1985) (where attorney is guilty of oppressive or wrongful conduct during\r\ncourse of proceeding to enforce claim of principal, principal is liable for\r\nattorneyâ€™s wrongful acts); Nyer v. Carter, 367 A.2d 1375 (Me. 1977) (if\r\ntort committed by agent/attorney, then principal/client is liable if act was\r\ndone within scope of attorneyâ€™s employment, even though client did not\r\nspecifically authorize the tortious conduct).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26011","title":"Carr v.

Guerard, Jr. (Guerard)\r\nfraudulently concealed transfers of money to the other respondents, Guerardâ€™s\r\nwife and son.&nbsp; According to Carrâ€™s complaint, Guerard concealed the\r\ntransfers to avoid satisfaction of a judgment entered by confession on June 14,\r\n1991.[2]&nbsp; The circuit court\r\ngranted Guerardâ€™s motion for summary judgment, holding that Carrâ€™s\r\nfraudulent-transfer action was, in reality, an action on the judgment that was\r\nmore than ten years old.&nbsp; We certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\nSCACR, and we affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe judgment was entered on June 14,\r\n1991.&nbsp; Throughout the next ten years, Carr actively sought but was unable\r\nto locate assets of Guerard to satisfy the judgment.&nbsp; On January 11, 2002\r\n- ten years and seven months after entry of the judgment - Carr brought this\r\naction based on the Statute of Elizabeth.&nbsp; Carr alleges that beginning in\r\n1997, Guerard wrote checks to his wife and son on funds that should have been\r\nused to satisfy the judgment.&nbsp; Carr further alleges that Guerard\r\nfraudulently concealed the transfers to avoid fulfilling his obligation to\r\nCarr.&nbsp;\r\nGuerard and the other respondents\r\nmoved for summary judgment, arguing that Carrâ€™s action was an action to\r\nrecover on the 1991 judgment and that the judgment was stale because it was over\r\nten years old.&nbsp; The circuit court agreed and granted summary judgment to\r\nthe respondents.&nbsp;\r\nOn appeal, Carr argues that his\r\nfraudulent-transfer action is not an action to recover on the judgment but\r\nrather an independent action.&nbsp; Further, Carr claims, the statute of\r\nlimitations in South Carolina Code section 15-3-530[3] applies, and Carr asserts he brought this action\r\nwithin the limitations period.\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether the circuit court erred in\r\nholding that Carr is prevented from pursuing his fraudulent-transfer action\r\nbecause his judgment is more than ten years old.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Statute of Elizabeth renders\r\nvoid any transfer of property made with â€œintent or purpose to delay, hinder,\r\nor defraud creditors and others.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-23-10 (Supp.\r\n2004).&nbsp; The statute may be employed by any creditor, including a judgment\r\ncreditor. &nbsp;Future Group, II v. NationsBank, 324 S.C. 89, 98, 478\r\nS.E.2d 45, 50 (1996); Lebovitz v. Mudd, 293 S.C. 49, 52-53, 358 S.E.2d\r\n698, 700-01 (1987).&nbsp; When a judgment creditor is the plaintiff, the statute\r\nlimiting the time for executing on judgments to ten years might also\r\napply.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-30 (1976).[4]&nbsp; It does here.[5]&nbsp;\r\nThere are alternate reasons that\r\nsection 15-39-30 prevents Carr from succeeding in this action.&nbsp; First, as\r\nsoon as his judgment became more than ten years old, Carr lost his\r\njudgment-creditor status.&nbsp; Because he is no longer a creditor, he lacks\r\nstanding to bring an action under the Statute of Elizabeth.\r\nSecond, and notwithstanding the\r\nabsence of standing, it is apparent that Carrâ€™s fraudulent-transfer action is\r\npart of an attempt to execute on the expired judgment.&nbsp; Carr seeks to have\r\nthe money transfers set aside so that he can attach the funds, which he says\r\nshould have been used to satisfy his judgment.&nbsp; South Carolina courts will not permit a litigant to bypass the\r\nten-year limitation on executions by styling an action as something other than\r\nan action to execute.&nbsp; See Garrison v. Owens, 258 S.C. 442,\r\n445, 189 S.E.2d 31, 33 (1972) (after reviewing the complaint, which stated that\r\nthe action was in equity, finding that â€œirrespective of this characterization\r\nwhich appellant seeks to apply to the nature of her cause of action, its very\r\nessence partakes of an action upon her judgment,â€ and holding that because the\r\nplaintiffâ€™s judgment was more than ten years old, the plaintiff could not\r\nrecover on it); Hardee v. Lynch, 212 S.C. 6,13, 46 S.E.2d 179, 182 (1948)\r\n(containing essentially the same quote and holding).&nbsp;\r\nAlthough at this point Carr is\r\nseeking only to set aside the money transfers, he admits that his next step\r\nwould be to seek to attach the subject funds.&nbsp; The only way for him to do\r\nthat would be to try to execute on his judgment, which is stale.&nbsp; It would\r\nbe a meaningless exercise to permit the setting aside of the transfers despite\r\nCarrâ€™s inability to effectively take any subsequent action.&nbsp; Thus, under\r\nthe rationale of Garrison and Hardee, Carrâ€™s Statute of\r\nElizabeth action must fail.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nCarr is no longer a judgment\r\ncreditor and lacks standing to bring this action under the Statute of\r\nElizabeth.&nbsp; In addition, Carrâ€™s fraudulent-transfer action is actually an\r\nimpermissible attempt to circumvent the bar to his executing on the expired\r\njudgment.&nbsp; For these alternate reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s decision to\r\ngrant summary judgment to the respondents is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and\r\nBURNETT, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 27-23-10 through 27-23-90 (1991 and Supp.\r\n2004).\r\n[2] The judgment was originally obtained by Development Business\r\nCorporation, of which Carr was an officer.&nbsp; The judgment was assigned to\r\nCarr in 2000.&nbsp; For simplicity, we hereinafter refer to Carr and the\r\ncorporation collectively as â€œCarr.â€&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[3] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2003).\r\n[4] Section 15-39-30 states:\r\n\r\n  Executions may issue upon final\r\n  judgments or decrees at any time within ten years from the date of the\r\n  original entry thereof and shall have active energy during such period,\r\n  without any renewal or renewals thereof, and this whether any return may or\r\n  may not have been made during such period on such executions.\r\n\r\n[5] Carr argues that the respondents are not entitled to summary\r\njudgment because there is a question of fact whether he brought this action\r\nwithin the time provided by the statute of limitations.&nbsp; Carr is correct\r\nthat a three-year limitations period and the discovery rule apply to Statute of\r\nElizabeth claims.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2003); Walter\r\nJ. Klein Co. v. Kneece, 239 S.C. 478, 483-87, 123 S.E.2d 870, 873-74 (1962)\r\n(involving the 1952 Code); Home Port Rentals, Inc. v.

Hessenthaler (Hessenthaler) brought a breach-of-contract action against her former employer, Respondent Tri-County Sister Help, Inc. (the Shelter), alleging she was constructively discharged in violation of a nondiscrimination provision in the Shelterâ€™s employee handbook.  The jury awarded Hessenthaler $25,000 in damages.  The trial court denied the Shelterâ€™s motions for a directed verdict and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  The court of appeals reversed, finding that the employee handbook did not constitute a contract.  Hessenthaler v. Tri-County Sister Help, Inc., Op. No. 2001-UP-325 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 19, 2001).  After granting rehearing for a second time, we withdraw our two prior opinions on this matter and substitute them with this opinion.  We affirm in result. \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Hessenthaler began working as a monitor at the Shelter, a place for women and children who are victims of domestic violence.  By late 1995, Hessenthaler had advanced to the position of Shelter Director, a position directly below the Executive Director.  \r\nThat same year, the Shelter hired a new Executive Director, Audrey Harrell (Harrell), an African-American woman.  As soon as Harrell was hired, she began firing members of the staff.  At one point, she directed Hessenthaler, who is a white woman, to fire certain employees, also white women.  Harrell hired two black women and one white woman to replace the fired employees.  \r\nAccording to Hessenthaler, her disputes with Harrell continued and escalated.  One day, Hessenthaler told one of the new employees, a black woman, to operate the Shelter hotline.  The employee began to scream at Hessenthaler, and another new employee, also a black woman, joined in.  Hessenthaler reported the incident to Harrell and planned to file a grievance. But Hessenthaler testified that she was not permitted to file a grievance, and the next day, was told that she would no longer be supervising the two women.\r\nHessenthaler also testified that on January 1, 1996, someone called her at home to report that the Shelterâ€™s twenty-four-hour hotline was not being answered.  Hessenthaler called Harrell to report the problem.  Harrell demanded that Hessenthaler reveal the name of the person who informed her about the hotline.  Hessenthaler refused to answer the question, said she had to go, and hung up the phone.  Later, Hessenthaler called a board member to report the hotline situation and the conversation with Harrell. \r\nThe next day, Harrell met with Hessenthaler after work for three hours and forty-five minutes.  Hessenthaler testified that Harrell told her that she was going to be punished; that she was going to be demoted from Shelter Director; that her office would become a bedroom; that Harrell would â€œdestroy herâ€; and that hanging up the phone on her was â€œjust like calling [Harrell] the â€˜nâ€™ word.â€  Harrell suspended Hessenthaler for two days for insubordination, failure to assist the Executive Director in an investigation, and failure to follow the proper chain of command.  Harrell told Hessenthaler that a board member would contact Hessenthaler to inform her whether or not she could return to work. \r\nWhile on suspension, Hessenthaler experienced some health problems, including depression.  She also had a hysterectomy, and later broke some ribs in a car accident.  She periodically sent doctorsâ€™ notes to the Shelter in support of her leave-of-absence from January to mid-April.  The Shelter accepted the notes and did not terminate Hessenthaler.\r\nIn February 1996, while Hessenthaler was on leave, Harrell sent Hessenthaler a new employee handbook.  Hessenthaler testified that she never read the handbook because she was sick at the time.  After some communication by mail,[1] however, Hessenthaler and Harrell finally met at the Shelter on May 8.  During the meeting, Harrell proceeded to read the employee manual aloud to Hessenthaler.[2]  Hessenthaler admitted that the handbook was read to her â€œcover to cover, page by page, word for word.â€  \r\nThe manual contained a disclaimer in bold, all-capitalized letters, on the first page, which provided as follows:\r\n\r\n  THE LANGUAGE USED IN THESE PERSONNEL POLICIES IS NOT INTENDED TO CREATE, NOR SHOULD IT BE INTERPRETED TO CREATE A LEGAL CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT BETWEEN [THE SHELTER] AND ANY OR ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEES.  THIS DISCLAIMER TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER ANY STATEMENT IN THESE POLICIES.[3]  \r\n\r\nHessenthaler testified that she did not recall Harrell reading the disclaimer language.\r\nThe handbook also contained a nondiscrimination provision, which provided:\r\n\r\n  [The Shelter] is an equal opportunity employer.  All decisions, including hiring, training, and promotion, are made without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, handicap, sexual preference, or any other protected status.\r\n\r\nAfter the handbook was read aloud, Hessenthaler was offered the position as Shelter Manager, which included eleven more requirements than the job offered earlier.[4]  Hessenthaler testified that she was told that she needed to get a college degree, and that she would also have to assume the responsibilities of volunteer coordinator.  Hessenthaler testified she felt as though it would take eight people to do all of that work.  \r\n Hessenthaler left the meeting, telling Harrell that, due to all of the job requirements, she would have to think about whether she would accept the position.  Hessenthaler did not return to work by May 13 (her deadline for responding to Harrellâ€™s latest job offer) and later discovered that she had been fired.\r\nHessenthaler brought a breach-of-contract action against the Shelter alleging she was constructively discharged in violation of the nondiscrimination provision in the Shelterâ€™s employee handbook.  The jury awarded her $25,000 in damages.  The Shelterâ€™s motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied.  The court of appeals reversed, holding that the employee handbook did not constitute a contract, and therefore the trial court erred in denying the Shelterâ€™s motions.  Hessenthaler v. Tri-County Sister Help, Inc., Op. No. 2001-UP-325 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 19, 2001).  \r\n After granting certiorari, we reversed, holding that the question of whether the handbook created an enforceable contract was properly submitted to the jury.  Hessenthaler v. Tri-County Sister Help, Inc., Op. No. 25650 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 12, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 18 at 50).   Rehearing was granted, and following oral argument, we withdrew the initial opinion and substituted it with a new opinion in which we affirmed the court of appealsâ€™ decision in result.  Hessenthaler v. Tri-County Sister Help, Inc., Op. No. 25650 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 18, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 40 at 14).  \r\nAfter granting rehearing for a second time, we now consider the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the court of appeals err in holding that the employee handbook did not constitute a contract?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court must view the evidence and its reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).  The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.  Id.  On review, this Court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling only when there is no evidence to support it.  Id.\r\nDiscussion\r\nHessenthaler contends that the court of appeals erred in holding that the employee handbook did not constitute a contract.  We disagree.\r\nIn general, an at-will employee may be terminated at any time for any reason or for no reason, with or without cause.  Stiles v. Am. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 335 S.C. 222, 224, 516 S.E.2d 449, 450 (1999).  But when an employeeâ€™s at-will status has been altered by the terms of an employee handbook, an employee, when fired, may bring a cause of action for wrongful discharge based on breach of contract.  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 463, 560 S.E.2d 606, 610 (2002).  \r\nIf an employer wishes to issue an employee handbook or manual without being bound by it and with a desire to maintain the at-will employment relationship, the employer must insert a conspicuous disclaimer into the handbook.  Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 485, 357 S.E.2d 452, 455 (1987).  This Court has held that a disclaimer appearing in bold, capitalized letters, in a prominent position, is conspicuous.[5]  Marr v. City of Columbia, 307 S.C. 545, 547, 416 S.E.2d 615, 616 (1992); cf. Johnson v. First Carolina Fin. Corp., 305 S.C. 556, 409 S.E.2d 804 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding disclaimer appearing in all-capitalized letters, in a prominent position, conspicuous).\r\nThe issue of whether an employee handbook constitutes a contract should be submitted to the jury when the issue of the contractâ€™s existence is questioned and the evidence is either conflicting or is capable of more than one inference.  Small, 292 S.C. at 483, 357 S.E.2d at 454; Williams v. Riedman, 339 S.C. 251, 259, 529 S.E.2d 28, 32 (Ct. App. 2000).  In most instances, judgment as a matter of law is inappropriate when a handbook contains both a disclaimer and promises.  Fleming v. Borden, 316 S.C. 452, 464, 450 S.E.2d 589, 596 (1994).  But a â€œâ€™court should intervene to resolve the handbook issue as a matter of law . . . if the handbook statements and the disclaimer, taken together, establish beyond any doubt tha[t] an enforceable promise either does or does not exist.â€™â€  Id. (quoting Stephen F. Befort, Employee Handbooks and the Legal Effect of Disclaimers, 13 Indus. Rel. L. J. 326, 375-76 (1991-92)); cf. Horton v. Darby Elec. Co., 360 S.C. 58, 67-68, 599 S.E.2d 456, 461 (2004) (holding, as a matter of law, that a handbook containing conspicuous disclaimers and a non-mandatory discipline procedure did not alter at-will status).\r\nMandatory, progressive discipline procedures may constitute enforceable promises.  See, e.g., Conner, 348 S.C. at 464, 560 S.E.2d at 611 (holding that a handbook containing both disclaimers and a mandatory discipline procedure created a jury issue); Leahy v. Starflo Corp., 314 S.C. 546, 548-49, 431 S.E.2d 567, 568 (1993) (holding that an employer was contractually bound by the mandatory disciplinary procedure).  Such procedures typically provide that an employee may be fired only after certain steps are taken.  When definite and mandatory, these procedures impose a limitation on the employerâ€™s right to terminate an employee at any time, for any reason.  \r\nIn the present case, the employee handbook has a disclaimer on the front page, in bold, capitalized letters.  Because the disclaimer appears on the front page of the handbook, in bold, capitalized letters, we hold that the disclaimer is conspicuous as a matter of law.[6]  Marr, 307 S.C. at 547, 416 S.E.2d at 616; Johnson, 305 S.C. at 560, 409 S.E.2d at 806.  \r\nFinding the disclaimer to be conspicuous as a matter of law, we next turn to the question of whether the handbook contains a promise. Hessenthaler contends that the nondiscrimination provision constituted a promise, and that she was fired in violation of that promise.  The provision provides:\r\n\r\n  [The Shelter] is an equal opportunity employer.  All decisions, including hiring, training, and promotion, are made without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, handicap, sexual preference, or any other protected status.\r\n\r\nWe hold that this provision does not constitute a promise altering the at-will employment relationship and giving rise to a breach-of-contract claim.  See McKenzie v. Lunds, Inc., 63 F. Supp. 2d 986, 1003 (D. Minn. 1999) (holding that nondiscrimination policy statements in employee handbook are legally insufficient to sustain a breach-of-contract claim; such policies are too indefinite to form a contract between employer and employee); Cherella v. Phoenix Technologies Ltd., 586 N.E.2d 29, 31 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992) (holding that an equal opportunity policy announced in an employee handbook did not establish contractual rights supporting a breach-of-contract claim).  Unlike a mandatory, progressive discipline procedure, a general policy statement of nondiscrimination does not create an expectation that employment is guaranteed for any specific duration or that a particular process must be followed before an employee may be fired.[7]\r\nTo be enforceable in contract, general policy statements must be definitive in nature, promising specific treatment in specific situations.  See, e.g., Ex parte Amoco Fabrics &amp; Fiber Co., 729 So.2d 336, 339 (Ala. 1998) (â€œ[to] become a binding promise, the language used in the handbook . . . must be specific enough to constitute an actual offer rather than a mere general statement of policyâ€) (internal quotations omitted); Ross v. Times Mirror, Inc., 665 A.2d 580, 584 (Vt. 1995) (â€œ[o]nly those policies which are definitive in form, communicated to the employees, and demonstrate an objective manifestation of the employerâ€™s intent to bind itself will be enforcedâ€); cf. Bookman v. Shakespeare Co., 314 S.C. 146, 148-49, 442 S.E.2d 183, 184 (Ct. App. 1994) (finding that a sexual harassment policy contained a promise to â€œpromptly and carefullyâ€ investigate complaints of sexual harassment).  The nondiscrimination provision in this case was not specific and did not make any promises regarding disciplinary procedure or termination decisions.  Therefore, we hold that the handbook did not contain promises enforceable in contract. \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that the evidence in this case leads to only one inference:  the handbook does not constitute a contract.  Therefore, the issue of whether the handbook constituted a contract should not have been submitted to the jury. See Small, 292 S.C. at 483, 357 S.E.2d at 454 (holding that the issue of whether a contract exists should be submitted to the jury when the existence of the contract is in question and the evidence is either conflicting or admits of more than one inference).  \r\nConclusion\r\nBecause the Shelterâ€™s handbook contained a conspicuous disclaimer, of which Hessenthaler had actual notice, and because the handbook did not contain any promissory language altering the employment at-will relationship, we hold that the handbook did not constitute a contract.  Therefore, the Shelterâ€™s post-trial motions should have been granted.  \r\nAccordingly, the court of appealsâ€™ decision is affirmed in result.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  Among other things, Harrell sent Hessenthaler a job offer, which included the following responsibilities: (1) train Shelter staff and volunteers on Shelter policies and procedures; (2) ensure that these policies and procedures are followed by Shelter residents; (3) provide general facility maintenance and security management; (4) meet with Shelter clients weekly to discuss any problems/concerns regarding the Shelter; (5) recommend Shelter purchases to Assistant Director; (6) facilitate group on Shelter orientation and house rules with residents; (7) ensure that appropriate codes and standards are met; (8) purchase approved groceries for Shelter; and (9) other duties as assigned.\r\n[2] It is unclear as to why Hessenthaler did not read the handbook herself.\r\n[3] We recognize that the disclaimer, as written here, appears larger than it appears in the actual handbook.  \r\n[4] The requirements included the following:  (1) recruit, train, and motivate volunteers; (2) assess the need for volunteers and coordinate volunteer schedule to ensure twenty-four hour coverage and other related client services; (3) assist public relations coordinator to establish a Speakerâ€™s Bureau to promote public awareness and community education on domestic violence; (4) serve as speaker for the Bureau; (5) receive and process all non-monetary donations; (6) maintain appropriate statistics and logs on volunteers and complete required reports; (7) act as PR coordinator in development and distribution of newsletter; (8) assist in fund-raising activities; (9) solicit donations from various groups and organizations; (10) design and coordinate an incentive award program for volunteers; and (11) coordinate mass mailings to churches, social and professional clubs, and organizations in York, Lancaster and Chester Counties.\r\n[5] The General Assembly recently passed legislation requiring disclaimers to be in underlined, capitalized letters, appearing on the first page of the handbook, and signed by the employee.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-1-110 (Supp. 2004).\r\n[6] Although Hessenthaler may not have appreciated the conspicuousness of the disclaimer because it was read aloud to her, she had actual knowledge of the disclaimer and its contents.  She admitted that the handbook was read aloud to her, â€œcover to cover, page by page, word for word.â€  Her testimony that she does not remember the disclaimer language does not change the fact that it was conspicuous and was read aloud to her.  In addition, other sections of the handbook affirmed that employment remained at-will.  For example, a section of the handbook, titled â€œâ€™At-willâ€™ Employment,â€ states:  â€œ[the Shelterâ€™s] policy forbids guaranteed employment for any specified duration for any [Shelter] employee.  Exceptions to this policy may occur only with the authorization of the [Shelterâ€™s] Board of Directors.â€  There is no evidence in the record that the Board of Directors authorized an exception to this policy.\r\n[7] The discipline section in the Shelterâ€™s handbook did not contain any promises.

Robertson, of Danley Law Firm, P.C., of Columbia, for respondent Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: Claimants Bowman and Gainey commenced these workersâ€™ compensation claims alleging on-the-job injuries sustained on June 3 and September 15, 1998, while working for respondent State Roofing Company (Employer).Â  Employerâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation insurance carrier, appellant Travelers Insurance Company (Carrier), denied coverage on both claims asserting Employerâ€™s policy had been cancelled effective before either claim arose.Â  The two claims came before the single commissioner solely on the issue of coverage.Â  The commissioner found the policy was not effectively cancelled and ordered Carrier to appear and defend the claims on behalf of Employer.Â  The full Commission affirmed, as did the circuit court.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nEmployer purchased a workersâ€™ compensation insurance policy from Carrier with coverage for one year from November 8, 1997.Â  On November 20, Employer signed a finance agreement with appellant/respondent AFCO Credit Corporation (Finance Company) whereby Finance Company agreed to finance the annual premium of $4,616 for Employerâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  In exchange, Employer agreed to repay Finance Company in nine monthly installments.Â  Under this agreement, Finance Company was authorized to cancel the insurance policy if Employer did not comply with the terms of the finance agreement.Â  On December 16, Finance Company paid the entire annual premium to Carrier.Â  \r\nEmployer missed its first installment payment to Finance Company which was due January 8, 1998.Â  On January 20, Finance Company mailed Employer a Notice of Intent advising that if the payment and a late charge were not received within ten days, the policy would be cancelled.Â  On February 5, Finance Company issued a Notice of Cancellation (NOC) requesting that Carrier cancel the policy effective February 13.Â  A copy of the NOC was sent to Employer. \r\nFinance Company did not receive Employerâ€™s January installment until February 13 when the February installment was already due.Â  Finance Company advised Employer that its account was still delinquent.Â  Employer continued sending payments late and its account was not current until June 1998.Â  On June 24, Finance Company sent to Carrier a Request for Reinstatement.Â  After the June payment, Employer made no more payments to Finance Company.Â  On July 20, Finance Company sent a second Notice of Intent followed by an NOC on August 6 requesting cancellation effective August 14.Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that Carrier never refunded any unearned premium to either Finance Company or Employer. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the capitulation agreement signed by Employer resolve the issue of coverage?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does noncompliance with statutory requirements render the cancellation ineffective?\r\n\r\n\r\n  DISCUSSION    \r\n  1.Â  Capitulation agreement\r\n\r\nAppellants (Carrier and Finance Company) contend the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission has no jurisdiction because Employer signed a capitulation agreement acknowledging non-compliance with workersâ€™ compensation insurance requirements from March 1998 to February 1999.Â  This agreement was negotiated by the Commissionâ€™s Director of Coverage and Compliance after the Commission received from Carrier a notice that Employerâ€™s coverage had been cancelled.Â  The validity of the cancellation was not investigated for purposes of this agreement, however, and Employer remained adamant that it had coverage.Â  According to testimony by the Director of Coverage and Compliance, the point of the agreement was an admission that Employer was unable to demonstrate compliance.Â  After signing the agreement, Employer paid a fine for non-compliance with workersâ€™ compensation insurance requirements.Â  \r\nThe agreement in question specifically states:Â  â€œIt is understood and agreed by signing this Agreement [Employer] does not make any admissions or waive any claims or causes of action [Employer] may have against any third party, insurance company, agent or broker.â€Â  Under the limited terms of this agreement, the commissioner properly found Employer did not waive its claim that Carrierâ€™s cancellation of the policy was invalid.\r\n2.Â  Cancellation of the policy \r\nThe cancellation of insurance by Finance Company is governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-39-90 (2002)[1] which provides:\r\n\r\n  Â§ 38-39-90. Cancellation of insurance contracts by premium service company.\r\n  (a) When a premium service agreement contains a power of attorney enabling the company to cancel any insurance contract listed in the agreement, the insurance contract may not be canceled by the premium service company unless the cancellation is effectuated in accordance with this section.\r\n  (b) The premium service company shall deliver the insured at least ten days' written notice of its intent to cancel the insurance contract unless the default is cured within the ten-day period.\r\n  (c) Not less than five days after the expiration of the notice, the premium service company may thereafter request in the name of the insured cancellation of the insurance contract by delivering to the insurer a notice of cancellation. The insurance contract must be canceled as if the notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured himself, but without requiring the return of the insurance contract. The premium service company shall also deliver a notice of cancellation to the insured at his last address as set forth in its records by the date the notice of cancellation is delivered to the insurer. It is sufficient to give notice either by delivering it to the person or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the last address of the person. Notice delivered in accordance with the provisions of this statute shall be sufficient proof of delivery.\r\n  (d) All statutory, regulatory, and contractual restrictions providing that the insurance contract may not be canceled unless notice is given to a governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party apply where cancellation is effected under this section. The insurer shall give the prescribed notice in behalf of itself or the insured to any governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party by the second business day after the day it receives the notice of cancellation from the premium service company and shall determine the effective date of cancellation taking into consideration the number of days' notice required to complete the cancellation.\r\n  (e) Whenever an insurance contract is canceled, the insurer shall return whatever gross unearned premiums are due under the insurance contract to the premium service company which financed the premium for the account of the insured. The gross unearned premiums due on personal lines insurance contracts financed by premium service companies must be computed on a pro rata basis.\r\n  (f) If the crediting of return premiums to the account of the insured results in a surplus over the amount due from the insured, the premium service company shall promptly refund the excess to the insured or the agent of record. No refund is required if it amounts to less than three dollars.\r\n  (g) Cancellations of insurance contracts by premium service companies must be effected exclusively by the forms, method, and timing set forth in this chapter.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe commissioner ruled that Carrierâ€™s cancellation was invalid under this section because (1) the notices of cancellation sent by Finance Company to Carrier requesting cancellation did not properly give ten daysâ€™ notice to Employer; and (2) Carrier failed to refund unearned premiums with notice to Employer.Â  Appellants contend this was error.\r\na.Â  Notices of Cancellation\r\nThe commissioner ruled that the both the February 5 and August 6 Notices of Cancellation (NOC) failed to give the required ten daysâ€™ notice to Employer before cancellation.\r\nThe NOC mailed on February 5 indicated a cancellation date of February 13, less than ten days from the date of the NOCâ€™s mailing.[2]Â  The commissioner also applied Regulation 69-10(22) and ruled that the ten-day notice period does not begin to run until the second business day following receipt of the NOC by Carrier; therefore cancellation could not have been effective until February 18.Â  The commissioner concluded Finance Companyâ€™s February 5 request for cancellation was therefore invalid.Â  Similarly, the August 6 NOC indicated a cancellation date of August 14, less than ten days from the date of mailing.Â  Again applying Regulation 69-10(19), the commissioner concluded cancellation could not be effective until August 19 and therefore the August 6 NOC was invalid.\r\nAppellants contend the commissioner incorrectly calculated the ten-day period required by Â§ 38-39-90.Â  We agree. \r\nThe timeline under Â§ 38-39-90 indicates the premium service company must first deliver[3] to the insured a Notice of Intent indicating its intent to cancel the insurance policy in ten days.Â  Â§ 38-39-90(b).Â  Five days after this ten-day period expires, the premium service company may deliver an NOC to the insurance carrier requesting that the policy be cancelled.Â  The premium service company must also send to the insured on the same date a copy of the NOC.Â  Â§ 38-39-90(c).Â  \r\nUnder this statute, the ten-day notice to the insured is calculated from the date of mailing of the Notice of Intent, not the date of mailing the NOC as found by the commissioner.Â  Cancellation may therefore be effected a total of fifteen days from the mailing of the Notice of Intent.Â  See Hiott v. Guar. Nat. Ins. Co., 329 S.C. 522, 496 S.E.2d 417 (Ct. App. 1997) (under Â§ 38-39-90, cancellation must be at least fifteen days from mailing notice of intent).\r\nApplying this timeline to the facts here, the February 5 NOC properly gave notice to Employer that the policy cancellation could be effected as of February 13, which was more than fifteen days after the date of mailing the Notice of Intent on January 20.Â  Similarly, the August 6 NOC properly gave notice that the policy could be cancelled as of August 14, which was more than fifteen days from the date the Notice of Intent was mailed on July 20.Â  The commissioner erred in calculating the required ten daysâ€™ notice by using the date the NOC was mailed rather than the date the Notice of Intent was mailed.\r\nFurther, the commissioner erred in applying Regulation 69-10(22) to add an additional two days to the cancellation date.Â  This regulation provides:\r\n\r\n  22. Where a valid statutory, regulatory or contractual provision requires that notice be given a particular period of time before cancellation shall become effective, the insurer shall not be required to effect cancellation prior to the elapse of the period of time prescribed by such statute, regulation or contract; the running of such time shall commence the second business day following receipt by the insurer of the request for cancellation.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  This regulation tracks the requirement of Â§ 38-39-90(d) which provides:\r\n\r\n  (d) All statutory, regulatory, and contractual restrictions providing that the insurance contract may not be canceled unless notice is given to a governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party apply where cancellation is effected under this section.Â  The insurer shall give the prescribed notice in behalf of itself or the insured to any governmental agency, mortgagee, or other third party by the second business day after the day it receives the notice of cancellation from the premium service company and shall determine the effective date of cancellation taking into consideration the number of days' notice required to complete the cancellation.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nUnder the plain language of the statute, the additional two-day period calculated from the time the insurance carrier receives the NOC applies only in situations where a third-party, such as a lienholder, is entitled to notice.Â  E.g., Auto Now Acceptance Corp. v. Catawba Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 377, 570 S.E.2d 168 (2002) (before insurer may cancel a policy, it must provide notice of intent to cancel to third parties where it is affirmatively required to do so by statute, regulation or contract).Â  Since there is no third-party involved here, this provision does not apply.\r\nWe conclude the commissioner erred in ruling that the policy was not cancelled in compliance with the notice requirements of Â§ 38-39-90.\r\nb.Â  Failure to return unearned premium\r\nAs an alternative ground for finding the cancellation invalid, the commissioner ruled that Carrierâ€™s failure to refund unearned premiums to Finance Company with notice to Employer violated Â§ 38-39-90.Â  \r\nSection 38-39-90(e) requires that â€œ[w]henever an insurance contract is canceled, the insurer shall return whatever gross unearned premiums are due under the insurance contract to the premium service company which financed the premium for the account of the insured.â€[4]Â  Under subsection (f), the premium service company must refund any surplus over three dollars[5] to the insured.Â  By its terms, Â§ 38-39-90 is the exclusive means for cancellation of an insurance contract by a premium service company.Â  An insurance contract â€œmay not be canceled by the premium service company unless the cancellation is effectuated in accordance with this section.â€Â  Â§ 38-39-90(a).Â  Any violation of this section therefore invalidates cancellation.Â  South Carolina Ins. Co. v. Brown, 280 S.C. 574, 313 S.E.2d 348 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nHere, Carrier never refunded the unearned portion of the annual premium.Â  Since Carrier did not comply with all the requirements of Â§ 38-39-90, neither attempted cancellation was valid.Â  Accord Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 310 A.2d 49 (Md. 1973).Â  \r\nThe return of unearned premiums is not a mere â€œaccounting matterâ€ as appellants claim.Â  We have held that where an insurance policy provides for the return of unearned premiums upon cancellation, the tender of a refund is a condition precedent to an effective cancellation.Â  McElmurray v. American Fid. Fire Ins. Co., 236 S.C. 195, 113 S.E.2d 528 (1960).Â  Here, the refund of unearned premiums is required by statute; all statutory provisions relating to insurance contracts become part of the insuring agreement.Â  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Thatcher, 283 S.C. 585, 325 S.E.2d 59 (1985).Â  A return of unearned premiums as required under Â§ 38-39-90(e) is in effect part of Carrierâ€™s obligation under its policy and is therefore a condition precedent to an effective cancellation.\r\nAppellants complain that requiring the return of unearned premiums to effectuate cancellation goes against the interest of Finance Company, the entity requesting cancellation, and therefore could not have been intended by the legislature.Â  We disagree.Â  Once Finance Company requested cancellation, it had the right to demand repayment of the unearned premium.[6]Â  Further, subsection (f) requires the premium service company to credit any return of unearned premiums to the account of the insured and â€œpromptly refundâ€ any surplus over three dollars.Â  This provision works to the benefit of the insured and is an added protection ensuring notice to the insured.\r\nBecause Carrier failed to meet the requirement of subsection (e) of Â§ 38-39-90 that it refund unearned premiums, cancellation was invalid under subsection (a) of the statute. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe need not address the commissionerâ€™s alternative ruling regarding waiver and estoppel.Â  The judgment of the circuit court affirming the Commissionâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent because I disagree with the majority on the second issue.Â Â  The majority affirms the commissionerâ€™s ruling on the basis that the insurer failed to refund insuredâ€™s unearned premiums according to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-39-90 (2002).Â  I disagree.\r\nSection 38-39-90(e) provides in part, the following:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Whenever an insurance contract is canceled, the insurer shall return whatever gross unearned premiums are due under the insurance contract to the premium service company which financed the premium for the account of the insured.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAccording to the plain meaning of this statute, in my opinion, an insurerâ€™s duty to refund unearned premiums is not a precondition for cancellation.Â  Although the statute requires that a refund be tendered, the plain meaning of the statute requires the insurer to refund the unearned premiums after cancellation.Â  In my opinion, therefore, the statute makes the insurer liable for unearned premiums.Â  It does not, however, operate to invalidate the insurerâ€™s prior cancellation of coverage.Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would reverse and hold that insurerâ€™s cancellation of coverage was effective despite insurerâ€™s failure to tender the refund as required in S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 38-39-90(e).\r\n\r\n[1]This section was subsequently amended. \r\n[2]Under Â§ 38-39-90(c), the date of delivery is the date of mailing. \r\n[3]As noted above, the date of delivery is the date of mailing under Â§ 38-39-90(c). \r\n[4]In addition, Regulation 69-10(21) requires the return of unearned premiums within thirty days of cancellation and that a copy of the statement regarding the return to be sent to the insured.\r\n[5] This amount is now five dollars under the amended version of the statute.\r\n[6] Finance Companyâ€™s notice of cancellation in fact includes a demand for return of the unearned premium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26012","title":"Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v.

Beasley.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This case raises issues regarding the authority of a personal representative and a trustee, in administering a will and testamentary trust, to modify the plan established by a testatrix-settlor under an interpretation of the documentâ€™s language and the doctrines of equitable deviation and merger.Â  We certified this case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMary Etta Johnson (Testatrix) died testate on December 3, 1999, and her will was duly submitted to probate court.Â  The will provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  ITEM II:Â  I give and devise unto the EPWORTH CHILDRENâ€™S HOME[1] in Columbia, South Carolina, all of my personal effects including my jewelry, clothing, and furnishings.\r\n  ITEM III:Â  I give and devise any remaining funds in accounts which have always been in my name alone at [two financial institutions] unto EPWORTH CHILDRENâ€™S HOME, IN TRUST NEVERTHELESS, for management and distribution of the interest as follows:\r\n  \r\n    1.Â  One thousand and No/100ths ($1,000.00) Dollars per year unto my beloved sister, EDNA POSTON, for as long as she may live, which sum shall be paid directly to her or for her benefit in the discretion of my said Trustee.[2]\r\n    2.Â  Five hundred and No/100ths ($500.00) Dollars per year unto PROSPECT METHODIST CHURCH, for so long as it shall exist.\r\n    3.Â  The balance of the interest paid on my said accounts shall be paid annually to the EPWORTH CHILDRENâ€™S HOME.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . .\r\n\r\n   ITEM IX:Â  By way of illustration and not of limitation, in addition to the inherent, implied or statutory powers granted to my Co-Personal Representatives and Trustee under law, I authorize said Co-Personal Representatives with respect to any and all property at any time constituting part of my estate or trust to hold and retain such property, to sell and dispose of same at public or private sale, at such prices and upon such terms as my Co-Personal Representatives and Trustee shall deem proper, to invest and reinvest in any kind of property, real and personal, without limitation to the class of investments in which Co-Personal Representatives or Trustee may be authorized by statute or rule of Court; to manage, repair and improve real property belonging to my estate or trust, but said Co-Personal Representatives shall not be required to set up reserves for depreciation out of income; to lease any such real property regardless of the fact that the terms of any such lease may extend beyond the period of administration of my estate or the term of any trusts; to borrow money for the benefit of my estate or trust; to distribute any property in kind or in cash or partly in kind or partly in cash; to allocate any receipt or expense between income and principal, and to do all other acts which in Co-Personal Representativesâ€™ discretion may be necessary or appropriate for the proper and advantageous management, investment and distribution of my estate or trust, all of which may be done without order of or report to any Court.\r\n\r\nTestatrix named Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home as Trustee of the testamentary trust.Â  Testatrix named three relatives as co-personal representatives:Â  her brothers, W.F. Beasley and John Beasley, and her nephew, John G. Johnson.Â  W.F. Beasley has acted as the sole Personal Representative in this litigation. \r\nIn Items IV through VI, the will separately devised Testatrixâ€™s interest in three parcels of real property to the co-personal representatives for life, with the remainder interest devised to Trustee.Â  The will devised two parcels of real property directly to Trustee.Â  Trustee was directed to sell all the properties at fair market value when it received them, giving relatives of the life tenants or other family members the first option to purchase them.Â  Upon selling the properties, Trustee was in each case directed to pay the sale proceeds â€œinto my said testamentary trust established in Item III hereinabove.â€Â  The present total value of the charitable trust assets is about $300,000.\r\nIn 2002, Trustee filed a petition in probate court seeking a court order declaring the charitable trust terminated ab initio.Â  Prospect Methodist Church (Church) would receive a lump sum payment of $10,000, with the remainder of trust assets distributed in a lump sum to Trustee.Â  Church filed an answer agreeing with Trusteeâ€™s petition to terminate the trust.Â  Personal Representative filed an answer asking the probate court to protect the interest of family members, but otherwise agreed with Trusteeâ€™s petition to terminate the trust.Â  The South Carolina Attorney Generalâ€™s Office (the State), as authorized by statute,[3] responded by opposing Trusteeâ€™s petition and asking the probate court to protect the interests of the charitable trust.\r\nThe probate court, after a hearing, terminated the testamentary trust from its inception and ordered the immediate distribution of trust assets to the beneficiaries.Â  The probate court relied on its interpretation of Item IX of the will and the doctrines of equitable deviation and merger.Â  The circuit court affirmed and adopted the probate court order by reference.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.Â  Did the probate and circuit courts err in interpreting Item IX of the will to give Trustee and Personal Representative the authority to seek termination of the testamentary trust from its inception and distribute the trust assets immediately to the beneficiaries?\r\n  II.Â  Did the probate and circuit courts err in ruling that the equitable deviation doctrine provides a basis for terminating the testamentary trust from its inception and immediately distributing the trust assets to the beneficiaries?\r\n  III.Â  Did the probate and circuit courts err in ruling that the merger doctrine provides a basis for terminating the testamentary trust from its inception and immediately distributing the trust assets to the beneficiaries?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to construe a will is an action at law.Â  See Kemp v. Rawlings, 358 S.C. 28, 34, 594 S.E.2d 845, 848 (2004); Epting v. Mayer, 283 S.C. 517, 323 S.E.2d 797 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  When reviewing an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s jurisdiction is limited to correction of errors at law.Â  The appellate court will not disturb the judgeâ€™s findings of fact as long as they are reasonably supported by the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  LANGUAGE OF WILL AND TESTAMENTARY TRUST\r\nThe State argues the probate and circuit courts erred in interpreting Item IX of the will to give Trustee the authority to seek termination of the testamentary trust from its inception and distribute the trust assets immediately to the beneficiaries.Â  We agree.\r\nItem IX of the will, as set forth above, grants certain general powers to Trustee and Personal Representative.Â  Trustee, in an argument accepted by the lower courts, focuses on a single phrase of the paragraph:Â  â€œand to do all other acts which in Co-Personal Representativesâ€™ discretion may be necessary or appropriate for the proper and advantageous management, investment and distribution of my estate or trustâ€ (emphasis added).Â  Trustee argues this phrase demonstrates Testatrix placed great confidence in Trustee and authorized it to distribute all assets of the trust if it determines that is the best course of action.Â  Further, Trustee contends the language of the will contemplates the trust may terminate at some point because it allows Trustee to enter into leases extending beyond termination.\r\nThe cardinal rule of will construction is to determine and give effect to the testatorâ€™s intent from a reading of the will as a whole.Â  Matter of Clark, 308 S.C. 328, 330, 417 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1992); May v. Riley, 279 S.C. 248, 250, 305 S.E.2d 77, 78 (1983); Albergotti v. Summers, 205 S.C. 179, 182, 31 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1944).Â  In construing the language of a will, the appellate court must give words their ordinary, plain meaning unless it is clear the testator intended a different sense, or unless such a meaning would lead to an inconsistency with the testatorâ€™s declared intention.Â  Buist v. Walton, 104 S.C. 95, 88 S.E. 357 (1916); In re Estate of Fabian, 326 S.C. 349, 353, 483 S.E.2d 474, 476 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A will must be read in the ordinary and grammatical sense of the words employed, unless some obvious absurdity, repugnancy, or inconsistency with the declared intention of the testator, as abstracted from the whole will, would follow from such construction.Â  Clark, 308 S.C. at 330, 417 S.E.2d at 857; Love v. Love, 208 S.C. 363, 369, 38 S.E.2d 231, 233 (1946).\r\nA court may not consider the will piecemeal, but must give due weight to all its language and provisions, giving effect to every part when, under a reasonable interpretation, all the provisions may be harmonized with each other and with the will as a whole.Â  King v. S.C. Tax Commn., 253 S.C. 646, 649, 173 S.E.2d 92, 93 (1970); Wise v. Poston, 281 S.C. 574, 578, 316 S.E.2d 412, 414 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The rules of construction are of secondary importance to the need to ascertain what the testator meant by the terms used in the written instrument itself, and each item of a will must be considered in relation to other portions.Â  Allison v. Wilson, 306 S.C. 274, 278, 411 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1991).Â  An interpretation that fits into the whole scheme or plan of the will is most likely to be the correct interpretation of the intent of the testator.Â  Lemmon v. Wilson, 204 S.C. 50, 69, 28 S.E.2d 792, 800 (1944).\r\nAs with a will, the primary consideration in construing a trust is to discern the settlorâ€™s intent.Â  Bowles v. Bradley, 319 S.C. 377, 380, 461 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1995).Â  In fact, the law relating to discerning the drafterâ€™s intent is identical for wills and trusts.Â  All Saints Parish, Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church, 358 S.C. 209, 224 n.10, 595 S.E.2d 253, 262 n.10 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œCharitable trusts are entitled to peculiar favor; the courts will construe them to give them effect, if possible, and to carry out the general intention of the donor.â€Â  Colin McK. Grant Home v. Medlock, 292 S.C. 466, 470, 349 S.E.2d 655, 657 (Ct. App. 1986) (citing Porcher v. Cappelmann, 187 S.C. 491, 499, 198 S.E. 8, 11 (1938)).\r\nWhile precedent is helpful at times, â€œno will has a brother.â€Â  A court may find little guidance in prior decisions interpreting wills and testamentary trusts in other cases due to the different intent and circumstances of each testator or settlor.Â  E.g. Estate of Houston, 421 A.2d 166, 170 n.5 (Pa. 1980) (â€œâ€˜No will has a brother,â€™ declared Sir William Jones. . . . Each will is its own best interpreter, and a construction of one is no certain guide to the meaning of another.â€); Ball v. Phelan, 49 So. 956, 963 (Miss. 1909) (â€œIf any one thing can be evident, after the review of the authorities, it is what Sir William Jones said more than 200 years ago, that â€˜no will has a brother.â€™Â  Every will must be determined upon considerations pertaining to its own peculiar facts and terms alone.â€)\r\nIn the present case, Testatrix and the will drafter could have given greater scrutiny to the potential impact of the phrase - â€œdistribution of my estate or trustâ€ - contained in the recitation of general powers set forth in Item IX.Â  Testatrix could have stated explicitly whether the â€œdistributionâ€ at issue was distribution of all trust assets or simply distribution of the annual interest income as provided in Item III.Â  She did not. \r\nNevertheless, we conclude the lower courtsâ€™ interpretation of the language is not reasonably supported by a plain reading of the will and testamentary trust.Â  The lower courts erred in discerning Testatrixâ€™s intent by isolating this single phrase and interpreting it in a manner which conflicts with the remainder of the will.Â  A reading of the will and testamentary trust as a whole, giving due weight to all their provisions in an effort to read them in harmony, reveals Testatrix did not intend by this phrase to give Trustee the power to terminate the trust and immediately distribute all trust assets. \r\nThe grant of various general powers in Item IX, including the cited phrase, was intended to give substantial latitude to Trustee and Personal Representative in the management and administration of Testatrixâ€™s trust and estate.Â  However, the â€œdistributionâ€ contemplated by Testatrix as shown by the terms of her will was not the immediate distribution of all trust assets, but distribution of the annual sum of interest on the invested funds.Â  Testatrix intended to ensure Trustee had ample freedom to spend the annual sum as it wished without extensive oversight or interference.Â  We conclude this single phrase, although inartfully drafted, can not be read in isolation in a manner which conflicts with the obvious, stated intent of Testatrix as shown throughout the remainder of her will.\r\nThis interpretation accurately reflects Testatrixâ€™s intent because, first, Item III plainly and explicitly states the assets are to be held in trust, with specific amounts paid annually to Testatrixâ€™s sister â€œfor as long as she may liveâ€ and to Church â€œfor so long as it shall exist.â€Â  Remaining accrued interest must be paid annually to Trustee, an event which Testatrix expected to occur for the foreseeable future because that provision contained no limiting language.Â  Second, each provision relating to five parcels of real property requires â€œproceeds of the sale of this property shall be paid into my said testamentary trust established in ITEM III hereinabove.â€Â  This requirement again reflects Testatrixâ€™s desire to establish a trust in perpetuity for the benefit of Trustee and Church.Â  Third, it is evident from the face of the document that Testatrix understood the difference between an outright devise and one placed in trust because she devised her personal property outright to Trustee in Item II while placing other assets in trust in Item III. \r\nTrustee further argues that obtaining the money in a lump sum would allow Trustee to more effectively accomplish its mission than receiving interest income in smaller, incremental amounts.Â  Therefore, because Testatrix admired Trusteeâ€™s mission and efforts, she would approve of an immediate disbursal of the trust assets.Â  Trustee also asserts administrative costs will consume a substantial portion of the annual income and Trustee in truth does not wish to serve as Trustee.Â  We note Trustee did not present any testimony or evidence in the probate court supporting its conclusory assertions.\r\nThese arguments are decidedly unpersuasive.Â  Trusteeâ€™s wish that Testatrix would have disposed of her estate differently and its beliefs about the best way for Testatrix to make a charitable gift, as well as Trusteeâ€™s understandable desire to receive the corpus now, are irrelevant and of no legal import in these circumstances.Â  Trustee is a well established and respected institution which undoubtedly could use the trust assets for current needs.Â  \r\nHowever, Testatrix has established an enforceable testamentary trust, and the courts are required to enforce it.Â  Administrative costs should not be prohibitive, assuming Trustee has invested the funds conservatively.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-302 (Supp. 2004) (Uniform Prudent Investor Act).Â  \r\nII.Â  EQUITABLE DEVIATION DOCTRINE\r\nThe State argues the probate and circuit courts erred in ruling the equitable deviation doctrine provides a basis for terminating the testamentary trust from its inception and immediately distributing the trust assets to the beneficiaries.Â  The doctrine does not apply.Â  Trustee has not shown any changed circumstances or conditions which have occurred since Testatrix established the charitable trust.Â  We agree.\r\nThis Court has rejected the doctrine of cy pres, which allows a court in limited circumstances to apply the funds of a charitable trust to a purpose not designated by the terms of the trust, but related to the original purpose.Â  S.C. Natl. Bank v. Bonds, 260 S.C. 327, 337, 195 S.E.2d 835, 840 (1973); Mars v. Gilbert, 93 S.C. 455, 465, 77 S.E. 131, 134 (1913); All Saints Parish, Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church, 358 S.C. 209, 227, 595 S.E.2d 253, 263 (Ct. App. 2004); Colin McK. Grant Home v. Medlock, 292 S.C. 466, 470, 349 S.E.2d 655, 657 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  However, our appellate courts have approved of and applied the doctrine of equitable deviation, which â€œpermits deviation from a term of the trust if, owing to circumstances not known to the settlor and not anticipated by him, compliance would defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust.Â  Under these circumstances a court may direct or permit a trustee to accomplish acts that are unauthorized or even forbidden by the terms of the trust.â€Â  Colin McK. Grant Home, 292 S.C. at 473, 349 S.E.2d at 659 (allowing trustees to deviate from original terms of charitable trust by selling six homes built in Charleston to serve needy, elderly, white Presbyterians and investing proceeds of sale with income distributed as housing subsidy to elderly, needy Presbyterians of all races).\r\nWhen circumstances change, it is not always required â€œthat the details of the plan laid down in the will must be followed to the letter.Â  The main purpose [of the will and testamentary trust] being kept in view, considerable flexibility will always be allowed in the details of the execution of a trust, so as to adapt it to the changed conditions.â€Â  Mars, 93 S.C. at 466, 77 S.E. at 135 (refusing to allow trustees of John de la Howe School to deviate from original terms of charitable trust contained in 1797 will by devoting funds to college scholarships instead of early education, but explaining trustees could establish a school at a different location, which could work in conjunction with public school system to teach agricultural and mechanical arts); see also S.C. Natl. Bank, 260 S.C. 327, 195 S.E.2d 835 (allowing trustees to deviate from original terms of charitable trust contained in a 1947 will to provide college funds to â€œdeserving students of Greenville City High Schoolsâ€ to include such students attending all high schools within a reorganized, consolidated, and much-changed school district encompassing most of Greenville County in 1970s when the trust provision took effect); Furman Univ. v. McLeod, 238 S.C. 475, 120 S.E.2d 865 (1961) (allowing university trustees, in light of changed conditions related to growth of city, advent of automobile, and changes in neighborhood, to deviate from trust established by nineteenth century deeds by selling original college sites and relocating university to area outside city).\r\nTrustee, repeating some of same arguments discussed in Issue I, contends its situation is analogous to those present in S.C. Natl. Bank, Furman Univ., and Colin McK. Grant Home.Â  Trustee argues Testatrix intended to assist Trustee and Church in their respective missions, but the â€œreal value in [Testatrixâ€™s] gift is not its ability to produce income, but its ability to provide current assistance to the beneficiaries in carrying out their missions. . . . Even if [Testatrixâ€™s] Will does not provide the power to distribute the trust assets, the court should alter the terms of the trust to allow the distribution.â€ \r\nThe lower courtsâ€™ finding is not reasonably supported by a plain reading of the testamentary trust.Â  The equitable deviation doctrine simply is not implicated in the present case.Â  Trustee has not identified any changed conditions or circumstances which would justify deviation from the terms of Testatrixâ€™s charitable trust.Â  Trustee and Church still exist and are engaged in the same mission and efforts they were pursuing when Testatrix wrote her will.Â  As explained in Issue I, Testatrix intended to establish a fund which would generate income annually for the beneficiaries, and that is exactly what must occur.Â  \r\nIII.Â  MERGER DOCTRINE \r\nThe State contends the probate and circuit courts erred in ruling that the merger doctrine provides a basis for terminating the testamentary trust from its inception and immediately distributing the trust assets to the beneficiaries.Â  We agree.\r\nA testamentary trust arises when a testator, in his will, declares the creation of a trust, identifies the property to which the trust pertains, and names a trustee and a beneficiary.Â  Johnson v. Thornton, 264 S.C. 252, 257, 214 S.E.2d 124, 127 (1975).Â  In a trust, the trustee holds the legal estate or title for the benefit of the beneficiary.Â  The beneficiary holds the equitable estate or title and enjoys the benefits of the estate.Â  Id. at 257, 214 S.E.2d at 127; Morgan v. Merchants &amp; Planters Natl. Bank, 247 S.C. 435, 441, 147 S.E.2d 702, 705 (1966); Albergotti v. Summers, 203 S.C. 137, 143-44, 26 S.E.2d 395, 398 (1943); Board of Directors of Theological Seminary v. Lowrance, 126 S.C. 89, 104, 119 S.E. 383, 388 (1923).\r\nThis Court has explained the merger doctrine in the trust context as follows:\r\n\r\n  An essential to the existence of any trust is the separation of the legal estate from the beneficial enjoyment; and no trust can exist where the same person possesses both.Â  If the legal and equitable estates come together in the same person the equitable is merged in the legal, and the trust is terminated. . . . A man cannot hold in trust for himself, but the whole interest vests in him absolutely, and any limitations over are void.\r\n\r\nBoard of Directors, 126 S.C. at 104-06, 119 S.E. at 388; see also Bogert, Trusts &amp; Trustees, Â§ 129 (2d ed. 1984); 28 Am.Jur.2d Estates Â§ 429 (2000); 31 C.J.S. Estates Â§Â§ 129-131 (1996) (all stating same principles).\r\nâ€œThe equitable doctrine of merger is not one to be applied with rigidity.Â  Equity will not apply merger if serious injustice would result or if the settlorâ€™s intent obviously would be frustrated.â€Â  Bogert, supra, at Â§ 129.Â  â€œThe merger of an equitable title into the legal title will not be permitted when the result would defeat the intention of the grantor or testator or the holder of the estates.Â  Thus, equity will not recognize a merger or union of the legal and equitable estates in the same person if this is contrary to the intention of the parties and a merger would be to destroy a valid trust, and will prevent the merger of an equitable and a legal estate to work substantial justice.â€Â  28 Am.Jur.2d Estates Â§ 429.\r\nTrustee contends that, because Church has expressed its desire to disclaim its interest under the testamentary trust, Trustee would become the sole beneficiary of the trust.Â  Both legal and equitable title would merge and vest solely in Trustee, which would then hold legal title to the trust assets.\r\nThe State argues that Testatrix intended to provide an ongoing annual benefit for Trustee and Church.Â  Furthermore, even if Church no longer existed, Trustee would still be required to comply with the terms of the trust and distribute the annual income for the benefit of the children cared for by Trustee.\r\nWe conclude, based on our enforcement of the terms of the trust as explained in Issue I, there is no merger of legal and equitable interests.Â  Trustee, as holder of legal title to the assets, has the duty of complying with the terms of the trust - managing the assets and distributing the annual income to the beneficiaries (itself and Church).Â  The merger doctrine will not be applied so as to defeat or frustrate the intent of Testatrix as revealed by an interpretation of the provisions of her will and testamentary trust as a whole.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the probate and circuit courts and uphold the terms of the charitable trust established by Testatrix in her will.Â  Trustee has the duty of managing the trust assets and distributing the annual interest income to itself and Church as provided in the testamentary trust.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home was established in 1895 by the Methodist Church.Â  It is a private, non-profit child and family service organization supported by church and private contributions, will bequests, and trust funds.Â  It provides services to children who are orphans, from broken homes, or who have disabilities or special needs without regard to race, religion, national origin, or ability to pay.\r\n[2]Â  Edna Poston is now deceased.\r\n[3]Â  South Carolina Code Ann.

Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-503 (1987) provides that the Attorney General shall, when necessary, bring an action to compel trustees to discharge duties imposed upon them by a charitable trust or comply with statutory provisions concerning the administration of charitable trusts.Â  The Attorney General is the proper party to protect the interests of the public at large in the matter of administering or enforcing charitable trusts.Â  Furman Univ. v.

Bordonâ€™s, Inc., 274 S.C. 275, 262 S.E.2d 881 (1980)).Â  â€œThe goal of the prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law is to protect the public from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representations.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe Court has held that non-attorneys may not prepare legal documents for others to present in family court when such preparation involves the giving of advice, consultation, explanation, or recommendations on matters of law.Â  State v. Despain, supra.Â  The Court noted its holding was for the protection of the public from the potentially severe economic and emotional consequences which may flow from the erroneous preparation of legal documents or the inaccurate legal advice given by persons untrained in the law.\r\nThe Court has also held that non-attorneys cannot negotiate guilty pleas on behalf of a party or represent a party in a guilty plea.Â  In re Lexington County Transfer Court, supra.\r\nIn State v. Wells, 191 S.C. 468, 5 S.E.2d 181 (1939), this Court held that a corporation must act through licensed attorneys in legal matters.Â  That holding was modified in In re Unauthorized Practice of Law, 309 S.C. 304, 422 S.E.2d 123 (1992), in which the Court held a non-lawyer, officer, agent, or employee may represent a business entity pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-80 (1986) in civil magistrateâ€™s court proceedings.[1]Â  The Court stated further that the magistrate shall require a written authorization from the entityâ€™s president, chairperson, general partner, owner or chief executive officer.Â  Finally, in Renaissance Enters., Inc. v. Summit Teleservices, Inc., supra, the Court held a non-lawyer cannot represent a corporation in circuit or appellate courts and once again held that a corporation may appear pro se only in magistrateâ€™s court.\r\nHowever, appellant is correct that this Court has never specifically addressed whether a nonlawyer executor or personal representative can represent an estate in matters such as this appeal.Â  Courts that have addressed the issue have concluded such conduct constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Ex parte Ghafary, 738 So.2d 778 (Ala. 1999)(relying on a statute which states only persons who are regularly licensed may practice law and its prior holdings that a person must be a licensed attorney to represent a corporation, the Alabama Supreme Court held a nonlawyer executrix could not represent the interests of an estate, a separate legal entity with interests other than her own, in a wrongful death action); Davenport v. Lee, 72 S.W.3d 85 (Ark. 2002)(holding administrators or other fiduciaries cannot proceed pro se in their representative capacity and that filing of pro se complaint by administrators of estate in a wrongful death action constituted the unauthorized practice of law); Ratcliffe v. Apantaku, 742 N.E.2d 843 (Ill. App. 2000)(holding that a nonlawyer personal representative could not represent the legal interest of the decedentâ€™s estate in a pro se capacity in a wrongful death action); State v. Simanonok, 539 A.2d 211 (Me. 1988)(holding nonlawyer personal representative cannot represent estate in court because practice of law reserved to persons who have established their qualifications therefore by admission to the bar); Waite v. Carpenter, 496 N.W.2d 1 (Neb. Ct. App. 1992)(holding nonlawyer personal representative who filed complaint on behalf of estate in wrongful death action violated statute stating no person shall practice law in a proceeding in which he is not a party unless admitted to the bar); Kasharian v. Wilentz, 226 A.2d 437 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1967)(holding wrongful death action brought by nonlawyer administrator on behalf of estate was required to be brought and appealed by a lawyer; â€œnominal representatives or even active fiduciaries of the persons in beneficial interest, not themselves lawyers, should not be permitted to conduct legal proceedings in court involving the rights or liabilities of such persons without representation by attorneys duly qualified to practice law.â€); State ex rel. Baker v. County Court of Rock County, 138 N.W.2d 162 (Wis. 1965)(denying petition of nonlawyer executor of estate to compel lower court to consider and act on petitions presented by executor on ground that presentation of probate matters to court for adjudication, when done in behalf of another, is the practice of law; â€œan executorâ€™s appearance in the conduct of a probate proceeding is not to be deemed the mere appearance of an individual in his own behalf, but is also a representation of others, and therefore an executor not licensed to practice law must appear by an attorney.â€); see also State Bar Assâ€™n of Conn. v. Conn. Bank and Trust Co., 153 A.2d 453 (Conn. 1959)(holding banks serving as executors or administrators of estates could not be represented in probate court by employees not licensed to practice law); In re Brainard, 39 P.2d 769 (Idaho 1934)(holding preparation and filing of papers in connection with probate matters constitutes practice of law and must be performed by person admitted to practice law); In re Otterness, 232 N.W. 318 (Minn. 1930)(holding executors, administrators and guardians are not authorized to conduct proceedings in probate except in matters where his personal rights as representative are concerned, as, for instance, where his account as representative is in question or misconduct is charged against him as representative); Ferris v. Snively, 19 P.2d 942 (Wash. 1933)(holding appearance on behalf of others in court in probate proceedings constitutes practice of law).\r\nThe same holds true in this state.Â  In the case at hand, the filing of a notice of appeal on behalf of the estate and preparation of briefs that will be required to further perfect this appeal clearly constitutes the practice of law as defined by this Court.Â  Section 40-5-310 prohibits appellant who, while the administratrix of the estate, is not a lawyer, from taking such actions on behalf of the estate because the estate is a separate legal entity with interests other than Ms. Brownâ€™s alone.Â  Moreover, the further reasoning employed by this Court in previous opinions, that such a prohibition is necessary to protect the public from representation by those unlearned in the law, also applies to the situation at hand, as noted by many of the courts cited above.\r\nIn addressing appellantâ€™s argument that she has represented the estate previously in matters before the Court of Appeals and this Court, we note that this issue was never raised in those cases; therefore, they do not serve as precedent for the issue in this case.Â  Renaissance Enters., Inc., supra.Â  Finally, appellantâ€™s argument that she and Ronnie have the same parents and that the parents agreed to her being the personal representative of Ronnieâ€™s estate is also without merit.Â  While they may have agreed to her being the personal representative of the estate, she does not state that they agreed to her representing the estate, nor could they given the provisions of section 40-5-310.Â  Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we find that appellant, because she is not admitted to the practice of law, cannot represent the estate in court as administratrix of the estate. \r\nRespondent argues that because appellant is prohibited from representing the estate, a proper notice of appeal has never been served and filed in this case.Â  Accordingly, she contends the appeal should be dismissed.Â  \r\nAs noted by the Supreme Court of Arkansas in Davenport, supra, there is a split of authority as to whether the unauthorized practice of law renders a proceeding a nullity or merely amounts to an amendable defect.Â  The court in Davenport followed the line of cases that, finding paramount the importance of protecting the public from those not trained or licensed to practice law, have concluded the unauthorized practice of law results in a nullity.\r\n\r\n  In light of our duty to ensure that parties are represented by people knowledgeable and trained in the law, we cannot say that the unauthorized practice of law simply results in an amendable defect.Â  Where a party not licensed to practice law in this state attempts to represent the interests of others by submitting himself or herself to jurisdiction of a court, those actions such as the filing of pleadings, are rendered a nullity.\r\n\r\nDavenport, 72 S.W.3d at 94; see also Ex parte Ghafary, supra (holding that an attempt by a nonlawyer executrix, acting pro se to represent the interest of an estate in a wrongful death action constituted the unauthorized practice of law, and as such, the pro se complaint was a nullity); Waite, supra (finding Waiteâ€™s violations of the statutory prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law flagrant and persistent and holding that if the lower court and the appellate court were to allow Waite additional time to retain counsel instead of dismissing the action, Waite would have engaged in the unauthorized practice of law to the possible detriment of the heirs, the defendants, and the courts with complete impunity).\r\nOther jurisdictions have found that the interests of the individuals represented by the personal representative call for giving the personal representative an opportunity to retain counsel rather than summarily dismissing the complaint or appeal.Â  See Kasharian, supra (holding that the fact that there had been no previous case addressing the issue, that retained counsel would presumably file a brief and appendix in compliance with court rules, and that administratorâ€™s failure to file proper papers was due to his ignorance of the law and legal procedure warranted giving him the opportunity to retain counsel instead of dismissing the appeal).\r\nBased on the facts and circumstances of this case, we deny the motion to dismiss the appeal and allow appellant a reasonable amount of time to retain counsel to continue with the appeal.Â  We base our decision on the fact that appellant has represented the estate in three previous appellate proceedings, leading her to believe that such was acceptable.Â  As in Kasharian, supra, there has been no previous case addressing this issue.Â  Moreover, in Renaissance Enters., Inc., supra, a case in which the shareholder of a corporation filed the notice of appeal and the Court of Appeals informed him a lawyer would have to be hired to represent the corporation, this Court, after determining the shareholder could not represent the corporation, remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with its opinion, which presumably included retaining counsel to represent the corporation.Â  We grant appellant the same opportunity.\r\nAppellant shall, within thirty days of the date of this order, provide the Court with the name of the attorney who will be representing her in this matter.Â  Failure to provide this information within the time allotted will result in this appeal being dismissed.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    s/Jean H.

Preston Reid, of Howard, Howard, Francis &amp; Reid, of Greenville, for Petitioner.\r\n        Jean Perrin Derrick, of Lexington; and Stuart G. Anderson, Jr., of Anderson, Fayssoux &amp; Chasteen, of Greenville, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Respondent, Cheryl Howard Craig (Wife), brought the underlying divorce against Petitioner, William Rhett Craig, III (Husband), seeking custody of the coupleâ€™s youngest child, division of the marital property, alimony, child support, and attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\n\r\nHusband and wife were married in 1974.Â  In January 2000, Husband told Wife that he wanted to end the marriage and that he had engaged in five affairs over the course of their twenty-five-year marriage.Â  Husband denied that he was having an affair and claimed the last affair he had was two-and-a-half years earlier.Â  The couple decided to separate.Â  In August 2000, Wife filed for divorce.Â  After filing for divorce, Wife learned that Husband was engaged in a pre-separation affair.Â  Husband denied this allegation, but before the case went to trial, Husband admitted the extra marital affair in a sworn affidavit submitted to the court.Â  As a result, Wife established pre-separation adultery and was granted a divorce a vinculo matrimonii.\r\nThe couple has three children.Â  The oldest child was living in the marital home at the time of the divorce.Â  The oldest child suffers from injuries sustained in a childhood bicycle incident, but is able to care for himself financially because of a settlement relating to the injuries he suffered as a child.Â  The second child is a college graduate who, at the time of divorce, also lived in the marital home while searching for employment.Â  The third and youngest child was a junior in high school and lived in the home.\r\nWife has a masterâ€™s degree in nursing and has been employed as a critical care nurse.Â  Husband is a doctor and is a partner in a medical group that specializes in internal medicine.Â  The couple has significant marital assets.Â  The total value of the marital estate was determined to be $2,473,430.10.Â  The marital property includes, but is not limited to, a home in Greenville, a significant 401(k) account, and other financial investment accounts.\r\nThe family court awarded custody of the youngest child to Wife.Â  In addition, the family court found Wife had a special equity in non-marital property owned by the husband.[1]Â  The remaining marital assets, including Husbandâ€™s retirement account, were divided equally.Â  Moreover, the court ordered that, after the graduation of the youngest child from high school, the marital home was to be sold and the proceeds from the sale divided equally.Â  In addition, the family court judge awarded Wife $500 per month in permanent periodic alimony and contribution toward her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Following the courtâ€™s ruling, Wife filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  The judge granted the motion and amended the order to grant Wife transitional monthly alimony of $3,000, until the sale of the marital home, at which time the amount of permanent periodic alimony would be set at $875 per month.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Despite the increase in alimony, Wife appealed and the court of appeals held that the family court erred in requiring the sale of the marital home and awarded Wife the home.Â  Craig v. Craig, 358 S.C. 548, 558-59, 595 S.E.2d 837, 843 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The court of appeals then divided the remaining assets of the total marital estate equally, awarding both parties $1,236,715.05.Â  Because the court awarded Wife the home, the court awarded Husband more of his retirement account to arrive at an even division of the assets and account for his equity in the home.Â  Further, the court awarded Wife permanent periodic alimony of $3,000 per month.\r\nThis Court granted Husbandâ€™s petition for certiorari, and the following issues have been raised for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in reversing the family court&rsquo;s order to sell the marital home and equally divide the proceeds between Husband and Wife?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in increasing the award of permanent periodic alimony to $3,000 per month? \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marital Residence\r\nHusband contends that the court of appeals erred in reversing the family courtâ€™s decision to sell the marital home and equally divide the proceeds between Husband and Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe division of marital property is within the discretion of the family court judge and the judgeâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C. 37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 24 (1988).Â  In order to effect an equitable division of property, the family court may require the sale of marital home.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 360, 384 S.E.2d 741, 745 (1989).Â  Before ordering marital property be sold, the court should first try to make an â€œin-kindâ€ distribution of the marital assets.Â  Id.Â  However, a family court may grant a spouse title to the marital home as part of the equitable distribution.Â  Id.Â  When distributing marital property, the family court should consider all fifteen factors set forth in the Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003).Â  The family court considers the desirability to award the family home as part of the equitable distribution and any non-marital assets owned by either party.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(7) and (10) (Supp. 2003).\r\nIn the present case, the court of appeals correctly awarded sole possession of the marital home to Wife.Â  The award of the marital home was part of the equitable distribution of the marital estate, not an award incident to support. \r\nIt is well established that family courts are empowered to include in an order for support that a party be provided with necessary shelter.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(15) (1976).Â  A party who is granted possession of the marital home as an incident to support does not obtain a vested right to stay in the home for his lifetime; rather, changed circumstances may necessitate later modifying the possession.Â  Whitfield v. Hanks, 278 S.C. 165, 166, 293 S.E.2d 314, 315 (1982).Â  An award of the marital home incident to support requires a showing that compelling interests exist, such as (1) the need for adequate shelter for minors; (2) the occupying spouse has a special need for the house because of a handicap or other infirmity; (3) the inability of the occupying spouse to otherwise obtain adequate housing; or (4) other special circumstances exist.Â  Thompson v. Brunson, 283 S.C. 221, 226-27, 321 S.E.2d 622, 625 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nBut if the house is awarded to a spouse as part of the equitable distribution of the marital estate, then no showing of special circumstances need be shown.Â  Donahue, 299 S.C. at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745.Â Â Â  The marital home is merely a share of the total marital estate.Â  Id.Â  The party either gets the house or the value of his share of the equity in the house. \r\nIn the present case, the home was ordered to be sold as a part of the equitable distribution of the marital property.Â  As a result, Wife does not need to demonstrate that special circumstances exist.Â  However, the family court erred in making its equitable distribution of the assets.\r\nIn distributing the marital property, the family court did not apply the factors outlined in section 20-7-472.Â  The family court failed to consider the desirability to maintain the marital home or consider the nonmarital property owned by Husband.\r\nAs to the desirability to maintain the marital home, Wife testified she had lived in the marital home longer than she had lived in any home.Â  Further, Wife testified that she feels safe in the home because it is in a gated neighborhood.Â  In addition, the children, even though emancipated, maintain rooms in the marital home.Â  These factors weigh heavily in favor of awarding Wife the marital home as part of the equitable distribution of the estate.\r\nIn awarding the home as part of the distribution of the estate, the family court also overlooked the abundance of property owned by Husband.Â  The record indicates that Husband owns an interest in at least three other properties either with his son or with other family members.Â  \r\nTherefore, we hold that the family court erred in not considering these factors when it apportioned the marital estate.Â  Accordingly, the court of appeals correctly awarded Wife the marital home in the distribution of the estate.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alimony\r\n\r\nHusband contends the court of appeals erred by reversing the family courtâ€™s decision to award permanent periodic alimony and by increasing the amount of the award.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  Alimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship.Â  Spence v. Spence, 260 S.C. 526, 529, 197 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1973).Â  Generally, alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as practical, in the same position as enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nWhen awarding alimony, the family court considers the following factors: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonable anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other relevant factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2003); Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 290, 555 S.E.2d 386, 391 (2001) (holding that the court is required to consider all relevant factors in determining alimony).\r\n In the present case, the family court abused its discretion by not addressing the standard of living established by the couple during the marriage.Â  Husband and Wife established a very high standard of living for themselves.Â  The couple has a very nice home in a very nice neighborhood.Â  Wife drives a nice car.Â  These are things Wife has grown accustomed to during the marriage.Â  But for the infidelities of Husband, Wife would continue to enjoy the life that she had during the marriage.\r\nTherefore, we hold that the court of appeals correctly awarded Wife an increase in alimony.Â  Accordingly, we direct that the increase in periodic alimony begins from the time the family court issued its order.Â  See Christy v. Christy, 317 S.C. 146, 152, 452 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding that modification of alimony applies retroactively only if ordered by the appellate court). \r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the reasoning outlined above, we affirm the court of appeals.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband owns an interest in several other properties that the family court determined to be non-marital property.Â  The court found that Wife had a special equity in the properties because she contributed to their improvement.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26013","title":"Stevens v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26013\r\nSubmitted June 2, 2005 - Filed July 25, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Acting Deputy Chief Attorney Wanda P. Hagler, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Molly R. Crum, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Sam Stevens (Petitioner) was charged with eighteen counts of receiving stolen goods and one count of obtaining property by false pretenses.Â  Petitioner pled guilty to all nineteen charges.Â  He subsequently filed an application for post-conviction relief (PCR), contending that he unknowingly and involuntarily pled guilty to eighteen separate counts of receiving stolen goods.Â  The PCR court denied relief.Â  After granting certiorari, we reverse. \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nAt the plea hearing, the State explained that Petitioner was part of a criminal enterprise, in which he would drive to various out-of-state locations to pick up stolen motorized equipment, such as tractors, lawnmowers, and four-wheelers.Â  He then delivered the equipment to a location in South Carolina where the equipment was stored.Â  He was eventually arrested at the storage location in South Carolina.\r\nAfter describing Petitionerâ€™s criminal activity, the State read each indictment into the record, identifying the company from which the equipment was stolen, the type of equipment, and its value.Â  The State did not, however, present any evidence as to when, where, or how many times Petitioner actually received stolen equipment.Â  \r\nPetitioner was charged with eighteen counts of receiving stolen goods[1] and one count of obtaining property by false pretenses.Â  Petitioner pled guilty to all charges against him.Â  He was sentenced to ten-years imprisonment on one receiving charge; ten-years imprisonment, suspended to five-years imprisonment and five-years probation, on a second receiving charge, to be served consecutively; and five years each on all other charges, to be served concurrently.Â  In addition, Petitioner was ordered to pay restitution.Â  He did not file a direct appeal. \r\nPetitioner filed an application for post-conviction relief (PCR), contending that he unknowingly and involuntarily pled guilty to eighteen separate counts of receiving stolen goods.Â  After a hearing, the PCR judge denied relief.\r\nThis Court granted certiorari to review the following issue:\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR court err in denying relief, finding that Petitioner knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty to all eighteen counts of receiving stolen goods? Â Â \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nA defendant who pleads guilty on the advice of counsel may collaterally attack the voluntariness of his plea by showing that (1) counsel was ineffective and that (2) there is a reasonable probability that but for counselâ€™s errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty.Â  Burnett v. State, 352 S.C. 589, 592, 576 S.E.2d 144, 145 (2003). Â On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.&nbsp; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).&nbsp; If no probative evidence exists to support the findings, this Court will reverse.&nbsp; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).\r\nDiscussion\r\nPetitioner contends that the PCR court erred in finding that he knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty to all charges against him.Â  We agree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-180 (1976) establishes the offense of receiving stolen goods and explains the various penalties associated with the crime.[2]Â  In addition, the statute provides the following:Â  â€œFor the purposes of this section, the receipt of multiple items in a single transaction or event constitutes a single offense.â€\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Petitionerâ€™s plea counsel testified that he explained the offense of receiving stolen goods to Petitioner, but he did not research or consider whether Petitioner should have been indicted for eighteen separate counts.Â  He admitted that he should have looked more closely at whether several instances should have been treated as a single transaction or event.\r\nWe find that the plea attorneyâ€™s failure to consider whether Petitioner was properly charged with eighteen separate counts of receiving stolen goods constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Â The plain meaning of the statute should have alerted counsel to the possibility that the number of indictments did not correspond to the number of offenses. Â At the very least, counsel should have questioned the Stateâ€™s lack of evidence as to when and how the goods were actually received.Â  \r\nIn addition, there is a reasonable probability that, had counsel informed Petitioner that he should not have been charged with eighteen counts of receiving stolen goods, Petitioner would not have pled guilty to each and every charge.Â  Moreover, Petitioner may have received a lighter sentence had the judge known that Petitioner faced four or five counts instead of eighteen.Â  Therefore, the PCR courtâ€™s decision should be reversed and the case remanded for trial or a new plea proceeding.\r\nConclusion\r\nBecause we find no evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that Petitioner knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty to all charges, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision and remand Petitionerâ€™s case for a new plea hearing or trial. \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Thirteen counts were for receiving stolen goods valued at more than $5000; four counts for receiving stolen goods valued between $1000 and $5000; and one count for receiving stolen goods valued at less than $1000.Â  \r\n[2] The statute provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  It is unlawful for a person to buy, receive, or possess stolen goods, chattels, or other property if the person knows or has reason to believe the goods, chattels, or property is stolen. A person is guilty of this offense whether or not anyone is convicted of the theft of the property. A person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a:\r\n  (1) misdemeanor triable in magistrateâ€™s court if the value of the property is one thousand dollars or less. Upon conviction, the person must be fined or imprisoned not more than is permitted by law without presentment or indictment by the grand jury;\r\n  (2) felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years if the value of the property is more than one thousand dollars but less than five thousand dollars;\r\n  (3) felony and, upon conviction, must be fined not less than two thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years if the value of the property is five thousand dollars or more.\r\n        For the purposes of this section, the receipt of multiple items in a single transaction or event constitutes a single offense.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26014","title":"Sloan v.

Coates, of Roe Cassidy Coates &amp; Price, P.A., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review Sloan v. Depâ€™t of Transp., Op. No. 2003-UP-416 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 19, 2003), in which the Court of Appeals found appellant Edward Sloan (Sloan) lacked standing to bring these actions challenging the procurement procedure used by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to award construction contracts.Â  We reverse the Court of Appeals on the standing issue and the circuit court on the merits.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nSloan, a resident of Greenville County, brought these three separate actions, which were consolidated for trial, challenging the procurement procedures used in the construction of: the Carolina Bays Parkway in Horry County, the Cooper River Bridge, and Highway 170 in Beaufort County. [1]Â  Sloan alleges the DOT violated statutory bidding requirements because these construction projects were procured by Requests for Proposals (â€œRFPsâ€) rather than competitive sealed bids.[2]\r\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court found Sloan did not have taxpayer standing or a particularized interest in the controversy.Â  However, the court found standing because the issues involved â€œgreat public importanceâ€ and the same procedure would be used in the future.Â  The court then granted the DOT summary judgment on the merits.[3]Â  Alternatively, it found laches barred the actions regarding Carolina Bays Parkway and Highway 170.\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that Sloan did not have taxpayer standing or a particularized interest in the controversy. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Sloan had standing and did not address the merits of the case or whether laches barred any of the actions.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1)Â  Is this case moot?\r\n    2)Â  Does Sloan have standing?Â  \r\n    3)&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in granting the DOT summary judgment?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1)Â  Mootness[4]\r\nThe DOT contends this case should be dismissed as moot because the construction contracts have been awarded and fully performed.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[A]n appellate court can take jurisdiction, despite mootness, if the issue raised is capable of repetition but evading review.â€Â  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 568, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001).Â  Additionally, â€œif a decision by the trial court may affect future events, . . . an appeal from that decision is not moot, even though the appellate court cannot give effective relief in the present case.â€ Id.Â  Clearly, this issue is capable of repetition, yet will usually evade review.Â  Accordingly, despite mootness, we will address the merits.\r\n2)Â  Standing\r\nThe circuit court found the issues raised by Sloan were of such public importance that standing should be conferred upon him.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed and held Sloan did not have standing because, even though raising an issue of public importance, he failed to show a nexus between himself and the actions.Â  Sloan contends this was error.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder the public importance exception, standing may be conferred upon a party &quot;when an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.&quot;Â  Baird v. Charleston Cty., 333 S.C. 519, 531, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999).Â  This Court has never held that there must be no other potential plaintiffs with a greater interest in the case or some other nexus, as the respondents now argue.Â  \r\nThis Court recently noted that standing is not inflexible and standing may be conferred upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.Â  Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, Â Â Â 608 S.E.2d 579 (2005)(holding Sloan had standing to challenge legislative enactment).Â  Additionally, both this Court and the Court of Appeals have found standing in other cases of important public interest without requiring the plaintiff to show he has an interest greater than other potential plaintiffs.Â  See id.; Sloan v. Sanford, 357 S.C. 431, 593 S.E.2d 470 (2004)(holding standing to challenge governor's commission as officer in Air Force reserve); Sloan v. Greenville Cty., 356 S.C. 531, 548, 590 S.E.2d 338, 347 (Ct.App. 2003)(holding plaintiff had standing to bring declaratory judgment action alleging county failed to comply with ordinances governing procurement). Furthermore, in an extremely similar case,Â  Sloan v. School Dist. of Greenville Cty., the Court of Appeals held that in addition to Sloan's standing as a taxpayer, Sloan had standing because the â€œissues involved â€˜are of such wide concernâ€™ that this declaratory judgment action should be decided for future guidance in the expenditure of public funds pursuant to competitive sealed bidding requirements.â€Â  342 S.C. 515, 524, 537 S.E.2d 299, 304 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  None of these cases required the plaintiff show the absence of any other potential plaintiffs with a greater interest or any other nexus.Â  Accordingly, despite the mootness in the present case, we find Sloan has standing to raise this issue.\r\n3)Â  Merits\r\nGenerally, there are two ways through which a construction contract may be awarded:Â  1) RFPs or Design/Build process; and 2)Â  Invitation for Bids or Design /Bid/Build process, also referred to as competitive sealed bidding.Â  The Court of Appeals recently addressed the differences between these two processes in Sloan v. Greenville Cty., 356 S.C. 531, 540, 590 S.E.2d 338, 343.Â  In that case, Sloan brought an action against Greenville County alleging it failed to comply with county ordinances governing the procurement of construction services when it awarded contracts for the completion of three public works projects.Â  As explained by the Court of Appeals, contracts awarded by the competitive sealed bidding proceed in multiple stages.Â  Id. An architect or other design professional is hired to prepare initial plans and specifications for the project and after approval of these initial plans, a bid package is developed to publicly solicit bids from contractors to perform the work. The lowest bidder is awarded the project.Â  Id.\r\nHowever, the RFP or Design/Build procurement method differs from traditional competitive sealed bidding in two important ways. First, under the Design/Build method, there is only one contract for both the design and construction of the project.Â  Second, the Design/Build method allows for subjective evaluations to be made when awarding the contract.Â  Price does not have be the sole or primary criterion for evaluating the proposals. Id. â€œIt is design-build's lack of objective, bright-line criteria that raises concerns about its use. Critics espouse that design-build vests too much discretion with the governing body regarding when and to whom public contracts are awarded. Because price is not a controlling factor in design-build source selection, the public entity may not always receive the lowest, most competitive price possible.â€ Id. at 541, 590 S.E.2d at 344.Â  Sloan contends that using the Design/Build method also limits the number of potential vendors who can submit proposals because construction companies without design capability cannot make proposals. \r\nThe DOT's discretion to use Design/Build method instead of competitive sealed bidding was limited by S.C. Code Â§ 57-5-1620.Â  This section provides: \r\n\r\n  Awards by the department of construction contracts for ten thousand dollars and more shall be made only after the work to be awarded has been advertised for at least two weeks in one or more daily newspapers in this State, but where circumstances warrant, the department may advertise for longer periods of time and in other publication media. Awards of contracts, if made, shall be made in each case to the lowest qualified bidder whose bid shall have been formally submitted in accordance with the requirements of the department. However, in cases of emergencies, as may be determined by the Director of the Department of Transportation, the department, without formalities of advertising, may employ contractors and others to perform construction or repair work or furnish materials and supplies for such construction and repair work, but all such cases of this kind shall be reported in detail and made public at the next succeeding meeting of the commission.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Sloan contends the respondents violated Â§ 57-5-1620 by awarding the construction contracts to someone other than the lowest qualified bidder (i.e. using the Design/Build process).Â  The respondents contend the DOT had other statutory authority to use the Design/Build procurement methods and, in any event, it does not matter because the DOT awarded the contracts to the lowest bidders complying with Â§ 57-5-1620.Â  \r\nAgreeing with the DOT, the circuit court found it had complied with Â§ 57-5-1620 because each project was ultimately awarded to the lowest bidder.Â  Sloan contends this was error.Â  We agree.Â  The fact that these three contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder is irrelevant.Â  As discussed above, the issue in this specific case is moot because the contracts have been awarded and fully performed.Â  However, as discussed above despite this mootness as to these three contracts, we have determined we should address the issue of whether the DOT should have followed Â§ 57-5-1620 in awarding other contracts.Â  \r\nThe DOT cites several statutes which it claims gave it the authority to use the Design/Build process.Â  However, these statutes did not specifically grant it the authority to use the Design/Build procurement method.Â  Further, when these contracts were awarded, there was no repeal by implication of Â§ 57-5-1620 nor was there a conflict between it and the other statutes cited by the respondents.Â  In re Keith Lamont G., 304 S.C. 456, 405 S.E.2d 404 (1991)(holding statutory sections that are part of the same general statutory law must be construed together).Â Â  While the DOT has determined that the Design/Build methodÂ  is more desirable, nothing in the statutes it cites requires the DOT to use it.Â  Furthermore, to hold as the respondents argue would render Â§ 57-5-1620 meaningless.Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court erred and the DOT must have followed Â§ 57-5-1620 in awarding contracts.\r\nThe circuit court judge also determined two of the three actions were barred by laches.[5]Â  The Court of Appeals, after holding Sloan did not have standing, specifically declined to address the laches issue. On appeal to this Court, Sloan failed to raise the laches issue.Â  The failure to appeal an alternative ground of the judgment below will result in affirmance.Â  South Carolina Tax Comm'n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 316 S.C. 163, 447 S.E.2d 843 (1994).Â Â  See Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Jones, 335 S.C. 295, 516 S.E.2d 468 (Ct.App.1999) (holding an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case, and the appellate court must assume the ruling was correct).Â  However, even if laches bars two of Sloanâ€™ actions, the third one remains. Accordingly, laches does not prevent this Court from reviewing this issue.\r\nSloan seeks a remand to the Court of Appeals for a determination regarding the bond issue.Â  This Court entered an order on September 22, 2004, striking from Sloanâ€™s brief any argument on the bond issue as procedurally barred because he failed to include the issue in his petitions for rehearing and certiorari citing Rule 226(d)(2), SCACR (only questions raised in Court of Appeals and in petition for rehearing shall be included in petition for writ of certiorari). Accordingly, this issue was not preserved for review.Â  Rule 226(d)(2), SCACR; see also Anonymous v. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 329 S.C. 371, 496 S.E.2d 17 (1998).Â  We cannot remand an issue not properly before us.Â  Accordingly, we deny Sloanâ€™s request for a remand.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, JJ., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, Sloan lacks standing to bring this action.\r\nAs the majority states, this case presents an issue of great public importance.Â  However, â€œ[t]he mere fact that the issue is one of public importance does not confer upon any citizen or taxpayer the right to invoke per se a judicial determination of the issue.â€Â  Crews v. Beattie, 197 S.C. 32, 49, 14 S.E.2d 351, 358 (1941).Â  I agree with the Court of Appeals that the existence of potential plaintiffs with greater interests, while not determinative in all cases, here weighs heavily against finding standing.Â  \r\nThe potential plaintiffs with interests greater than Sloanâ€™s are the companies to which the bid was not awarded.Â  Large amounts of money are at stake in bidding competitions, so a losing bidder has a strong incentive to take action if the process appears in violation of the law.Â  That no such bidder is now before the Court does not mean that Sloan automatically has standing.Â  When there exist numerous potential plaintiffs that have been directly and significantly affected, a court should be very reluctant to confer standing upon a member of the general public who can allege no particular harm.Â  Third-party standing is supposed to be the exception, not the rule.Â  \r\nThe recent opinions of this Court cited by the majority are distinguishable from the case sub judice.Â  Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d 579 (2005); Sloan v. Sanford, 357 S.C. 431, 593 S.E.2d 470 (2004).Â  Neither Wilkins nor Sanford involved potential plaintiffs capable of alleging such direct, distinct harm as that which the losing bidders could allege here.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn my opinion, Sloan lacks standing to bring this action.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ decision should be affirmed.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Sloan also sought to enjoin the procurement of the Cooper River Bridge project.Â  At the time of the hearing, construction had begun on the Carolina Parkways and Highway 170 and final funding was in the process of being secured for the Cooper River Bridge. The respondents represented that the Cooper River Bridge project would be similarly procured and it was.Â Â Â  \r\n[2]The Court has ruled that the bonding issue raised in the trial court is not properly before it.Â  (Order filed Sept. 22, 2004.)\r\n[3]The parties agreed that there were no factual determinations for the circuit court to make.\r\n[4]After oral argument in this case, the DOT filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that an opinion is now moot because of the enactment of recent legislation which allows the DOT to award construction contracts using a design/build procedure.Â Â  The legislation became effective June 14, 2005.Â  We denied the motion to dismiss.Â  This opinion is not moot as there may be other contracts which were awarded by the DOT prior to the enactment of this legislation.Â  \r\n[5]Laches is neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should have been done.&quot;Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 296, 519 S.E.2d 583, 598 (Ct.App.1999).Â  Under laches, if a party who knows his rights does not timely assert them, and by his delay, causes another party to incur expenses or otherwise detrimentally change his position, then equity steps in and refuses to enforce those rights.

Nichols, of\r\n        Bluestein &amp; Nichols, LLC, of Columbia,\r\n        for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:&nbsp; Following\r\npetitionerâ€™s (the Boardâ€™s) issuance of an order fining and suspending\r\nrespondent, respondent appealed to the Administrative Law Court (ALC).&nbsp; The\r\nALC reversed the Boardâ€™s order and found the Boardâ€™s failure to serve\r\nwritten notice within the statutorily-mandated time period divested the Board of\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction.[1]&nbsp;\r\nThe circuit court affirmed the ALC and the Court of Appeals affirmed in a 2-1\r\ndecision.&nbsp; Johnston v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor,\r\nLicensing, and Reg., S.C. Real Estate Appraisers Bd., Op. No. 2003-UP-688\r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed November 24, 2003).&nbsp; We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was a licensed real\r\nestate appraiser.&nbsp; In April 2000, the Board brought charges against\r\nrespondent alleging he violated the South Carolina Real Estate Appraisers\r\nRegistration, Licensing and Certification Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 40-60-2, et\r\nseq., and violated the 1997 Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal\r\nPractice.&nbsp; The allegations stemmed from a complaint regarding a real estate\r\nappraisal done by another appraiser, Kyle Smith, which respondent signed as a\r\nsupervising appraiser.\r\nAfter an administrative hearing on\r\nthe matter, the Board found respondent had committed the alleged violations and\r\nimposed a one thousand dollar fine and suspended respondentâ€™s license for one\r\nyear.&nbsp; The written decision was issued on October 23, 2000.&nbsp; Pursuant\r\nto statute, the Board was required to serve written notice of its decision on\r\nrespondent within thirty days of issuing a final order.&nbsp; See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 40-60-150(C)(3) (Supp. 2004).&nbsp; Two weeks after the Boardâ€™s\r\nwritten decision was issued, on November 6, 2000, the Board mailed written\r\nnotice of its decision by certified mail, â€œReturn Receipt Requested,â€ to an\r\naddress containing an incorrect zip code.&nbsp; An unknown person accepted the\r\nletter and signed the name â€œT. Griffinâ€ to the receipt.&nbsp; This card was\r\nreturned to the Board with T. Griffinâ€™s signature.\r\nOn December 7, 2000, respondent\r\nlearned the Board had posted his name on their website as being under\r\nsuspension.&nbsp; After respondentâ€™s inquiry, a copy of the written decision\r\nwas given to respondent by a Board employee.&nbsp; While this notice constituted\r\nproper service, pursuant to Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP, on respondent, notice was not\r\nserved on respondent until two weeks after the statutorily-prescribed time\r\nperiod had expired.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err by\r\n  finding the Boardâ€™s failure to serve notice of its decision within the\r\n  30-day time period prescribed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-60-150(C)(3) (Supp.\r\n  2004) deprived the Board of subject matter jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Board argues the Court of\r\nAppeals erred by finding that because the Board failed to comply with the time\r\nframe required by Â§ 40-60-150(C)(3), its inaction deprived the Board of subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory\r\ninterpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the\r\nLegislature.&nbsp; Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578\r\n(2000).&nbsp; When a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face,\r\nthere is no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute\r\naccording to its literal meaning.&nbsp; Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v.\r\nCity of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 442 S.E.2d 177\r\n(1994).\r\nSection 40-60-150(C)(3)\r\nprovides:&nbsp; â€œThe board shall render a decision and shall serve\r\nnotice, in writing within thirty days, of the boardâ€™s decision to the . .\r\n.&nbsp; appraiser charged. . . .â€ &nbsp;(Emphasis added). &nbsp;The language\r\nof Â§ 40-60-150(C)(3) clearly and unambiguously requires the Board to serve\r\nnotice of its decision to the appraiser charged within 30 days of its\r\nruling.&nbsp; The term â€œshallâ€ in a statute means that the action is\r\nmandatory.&nbsp; Wigfall v. Tideland Utils., Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 580\r\nS.E.2d 100 (2003); Charleston County Parents for Pub. Schools, Inc. v.\r\nMoseley, 343 S.C. 509, 541 S.E.2d 533 (2001).\r\nAlthough the 30-day time requirement\r\nis mandatory, it is not jurisdictional.&nbsp; Subject matter jurisdiction is the\r\npower to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings\r\nin question belong.&nbsp; Dove v. Gold Kist, 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598\r\n(1994).&nbsp; The failure to comply with a mandatory time requirement for\r\nserving a written decision does not affect the jurisdiction of the Board to\r\ndetermine the real estate appraiser disciplinary matter.[2]\r\nThe failure of the Board to meet the\r\ndeadline does not render the order a nullity.&nbsp; We conclude the order is\r\nvalid, but ineffective, until it is served upon the appraiser.\r\nThere is no indication the\r\nLegislature intended for the time limit to prevent the Board from having the\r\nability to discipline an errant appraiser if the Board fails to serve notice of\r\nthe written decision within the prescribed time period.&nbsp; Instead, the\r\nLegislature intended to speed the resolution of appraiser disciplinary cases for\r\nthe benefit of all parties involved.&nbsp; See, e.g., In re Martino,\r\n644 A.2d 546 (N.H. 1994) (thirty-day time limit intended to speed resolution of\r\nworkersâ€™ compensation cases for benefit of all parties involved; statuteâ€™s\r\npurpose would be frustrated if time limitation was interpreted as jurisdictional\r\nrequirement).\r\nWe note that, although the\r\nthirty-day time limit is mandatory, the Legislature has not provided how that\r\nmandate is to be enforced.&nbsp; There is no language regarding the consequences\r\nif the Board misses the deadline for serving written notice of its decision on\r\nthe appraiser.&nbsp; Accordingly, we will not assume the Legislature intended\r\nthe Board to lose its power to act for failing to comply with the statutory time\r\nlimit.&nbsp; See Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.S. 253 (1986)\r\n(courts should not assume Congress intended agency to lose its power to act;\r\nagency does not lose jurisdiction for failing to comply with statutory time\r\nlimit unless statute expressly sets time limit and specifies a\r\nconsequence).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the thirty-day time limit\r\nfor serving notice of the Boardâ€™s decision is mandatory, but not\r\njurisdictional, we reverse and remand to the ALC for a ruling on the merits of\r\nrespondentâ€™s claims.[3]\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Respondent also appealed the Boardâ€™s order on the merits;\r\nhowever, the ALC did not address those issues after finding the order was a\r\nnullity.\r\n[2]We note that the decisions of South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways and Pub.\r\nTransp. v. Dickinson, 288 S.C. 189, 341 S.E.2d 134 (1986), and Starnes v. South\r\nCarolina Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 342 S.C. 216, 535 S.E.2d 665 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2000) are not applicable.&nbsp; Both of these cases involve the failure of\r\nthe Department to hold a hearing within the statutorily-prescribed time period\r\nfollowing the suspension of a driverâ€™s license for driving while\r\nintoxicated.&nbsp; In these cases, both this Court and the Court of Appeals\r\ndetermined that the failure to hold the requested hearing deprived the\r\nDepartment of jurisdiction to hold the hearing.\r\nSubsequently, in the case of In\r\nre Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001), cert. denied,\r\n535 U.S. 1062 (2002), we held the failure of the State to conduct a trial to\r\ndetermine whether a person is a sexually violent predator or seek a continuance\r\nwithin the statutorily-required sixty days did not divest the court of\r\njurisdiction.&nbsp; We stated that Matthews should have filed a motion to\r\ndismiss when the State failed to bring the case to trial within the mandatory\r\nsixty days; further, because Matthews did not file the motion to dismiss, he had\r\nwaived his right to challenge the Stateâ€™s failure to comply with the requisite\r\ntime period.\r\nMatthews is in line with our\r\nstrict view of subject matter jurisdiction.&nbsp; See, e.g., State v.\r\nGentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005) (finding challenge to sufficiency\r\nof indictment does not involve subject matter jurisdiction); Dove v. Gold\r\nKist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598 (1994) (clarifying the difference\r\nbetween venue and subject matter jurisdiction).&nbsp; Our decision in this case\r\nreflects that strict view.\r\n[3]Once respondent brought the failure of service to the Boardâ€™s\r\nattention, the Board promptly gave respondent a copy of the Boardâ€™s written\r\ndecision.&nbsp; We find respondent was not prejudiced by the Boardâ€™s failure\r\nto complete service within thirty days of the Boardâ€™s issuance of its\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26016","title":"In the Matter of Harrell","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26016","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion publicly reprimanding an attorney","date":"2005-07-25","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n.Section2\r\n\t{page:Section2;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH\r\nCAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Lewie K.\r\n        Harrell,\r\n        III,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26016\r\nSubmitted June 3, 2005 - Filed July 25, 2005\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B.

The closing took place on May 31, 2001.&nbsp; Respondent was present at\r\nthe closing.&nbsp; Although the client and the seller had contracted for the\r\npurchase of one lot, the closing documents identified two parcels of land to be\r\nsold.\r\n&nbsp;On June 1, 2001, respondent\r\nfiled a Deed to Real Estate with the Newb&nbsp; erry County Clerk of\r\nCourt.&nbsp; The deed referenced both parcels of land.&nbsp; The deed, dated May\r\n31, 2001, contained the signatures of respondent, his paralegal, and the\r\nseller.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSubsequent to the filing of the\r\ndeed, a dispute arose concerning the sale of both lots.&nbsp; Respondent\r\nrepresents he instructed his paralegal to verify with the client that only one\r\nlot was to be purchased.&nbsp; No contemporaneous documentation memorializing\r\nthis conversation exists.&nbsp; Respondent represents he instructed his\r\nparalegal to prepare a corrective deed to remedy the error with the second\r\nlot.&nbsp;\r\nOn July 9, 2001, a Corrective Deed\r\nto real estate was filed by respondentâ€™s office.&nbsp; This deed referenced\r\nthe sale of only one lot.&nbsp; However, attached to the deed was the same\r\nsignature page executed by the parties on May 31, 2001.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;Respondent acknowledges he\r\nfailed to provide his paralegal with specific instructions how to prepare the\r\nnew deed and that he failed to properly supervise the paralegalâ€™s work.&nbsp;\r\nHe further acknowledges he failed to review the Corrective Deed before it was\r\nfiled with the Clerkâ€™s Office.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his\r\nmisconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional\r\nConduct, Rule 407, SCACR:&nbsp; Rule 5.3 (lawyer having direct supervisory\r\nauthority over a nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure the personâ€™s\r\nconduct is compatible with the professional obligation of the lawyer); Rule 5.5\r\n(lawyer shall not assist a person in the performance of activity which\r\nconstitutes the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule\r\n8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving\r\ndishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).&nbsp; Respondent acknowledges\r\nthat his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for\r\nLawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional\r\nConduct).&nbsp; \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s\r\nmisconduct warrants a public reprimand.&nbsp; Accordingly, we accept the\r\nAgreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his\r\nmisconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER,\r\nBURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26017","title":"In the Matter of Jackson","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26017","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion publicly reprimanding an attorney","date":"2005-07-25","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Marvin P.\r\n        Jackson,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26017\r\nSubmitted June 7, 2005 - Filed July 25, 2005\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B.

The memorandum line on one check,\r\nhowever, referred to a matter unrelated to the client or his business.\r\nAt the request of his client,\r\nrespondent deposited the checks into his escrow account.&nbsp; In accordance\r\nwith the clientâ€™s instructions, respondent disbursed the funds to his client\r\nand his clientâ€™s company.&nbsp;\r\nThe third parties filed a complaint\r\nwith ODC.
