He\r\nappeals the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n On Christmas Eve, 1996, Appellant, his brother Scott Cole, and his\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nfriends Jason Best and Jay McKown were together at Appellant's apartment.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nBetween 9:00 and 10:00 that evening, Paul Pennington and the victim,\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nBobby Spencer, arrived, followed closely by three young women. Pennington\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nand the victim asked to borrow money from Appellant and he refused. With\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nno apparent provocation, Pennington attacked Best, struck him several\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\ntimes about the head, and jerked Best's gold chains off his neck. Appellant\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nintervened, and he and Pennington fought briefly.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe victim broke up the fight between Appellant and Pennington.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nPennington continued to behave hostilely, and Appellant and Pennington\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nfought a second time. The victim told Appellant he was going to \"thug\" him\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nif he did not stop fighting Pennington. The fight ended and Pennington and\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nthe victim started to leave. As they went out the door, Pennington spoke\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nthreateningly to Appellant's brother and promised to return. Pennington\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nalso intentionally overturned Appellant's stereo on the way out.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nWhen Pennington and the victim went out the front door, Appellant\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nwent out the back door to his mother's apartment next door where he\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nretrieved his gun, a semi-automatic rifle. The gun was already loaded with a\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nclip. Appellant then went out his mother's front door. Standing in his front\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nyard, Appellant claimed he heard shots being fired. Appellant fired his gun,\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nkilling the victim: Appellant said he fired toward the ground, but the cause\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nof the victim's death was determined to be a gunshot wound to the chest.\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nBy all accounts, the shooting occurred three to five minutes after\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nPennington and the victim left Appellant's apartment. He fired the gun,\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nAppellant said, because \"I was scared they might be coming back. I was\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nscared they might come in my house and kill me and my brother, or maybe\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nnot kill, just hurt us, whatever. I didn't know what to do. I was scared.\"\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nAppellant testified that he did not intend to shoot the victim, he was just\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nscared and wanted to frighten Pennington and the victim away.\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nAppellant re-entered the apartment and said something to the effect\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\nof, \"I think I shot Bobby.\" Appellant appeared to be scared and in shock.\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n    When the police arrived in response to a neighbor's call reporting\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\ngunshots, the friends denied knowledge of a shooting, but Appellant insisted\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\non making a police report of the incident with Pennington. The police left\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nwithout realizing the victim was lying dead on the ground outside.\r\n\r\n   After the police left, Appellant dragged the victim's body, face down, up\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nan embankment. Appellant claimed he moved him toward the light so he\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\ncould determine if the victim was still alive. Other witnesses claimed\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nAppellant tried to get them to help remove the body and pick the shells up\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\noff the ground. One of the men present later reported the shooting to his\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nuncle, a sheriff's deputy. Appellant hid from the police and was arrested a\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nweek later on January 1, 1997.\r\n  The jury found Appellant guilty of murder and the judge sentenced\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nhim to life imprisonment. \r\n  ISSUE\r\n  \r\n     Did the trial court err in refusing to charge voluntary\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nmanslaughter?\r\n  \r\n  DISCUSSION\r\n   Appellant asserts the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nwith voluntary manslaughter.  We disagree.\r\n  The law to be charged must be determined from the evidence\r\n              \r\n\r\n              \r\npresented at trial. State v. Lee; 298 S.C. 362, 380 S.E.2d 834 (1989). In\r\n              \r\n\r\n              \r\ndetermining whether the evidence requires a charge on voluntary\r\n              \r\n\r\n              \r\nmanslaughter, this Court must view the facts in the light most favorable to\r\n              \r\n\r\n              \r\nthe defendant. State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 474 S.E.2d 430 (1996). To\r\n              \r\n\r\n              \r\nwarrant a court's eliminating the offense of manslaughter, it should very\r\n              \r\n\r\n              \r\nclearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the\r\n              \r\n\r\n              \r\ncrime from murder to manslaughter. State v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 434\r\n              \r\n\r\n              \r\nS.E.2d 272 (1993).\r\n  Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\nsudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation. State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 350 S.E.2d 180 (1986). Heat of passion alone will\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nnot suffice to reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter. State v. Walker,\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n324 S.C. 257, 478 S.E.2d 280 (1996). Both heat of passion and sufficient\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nlegal provocation must be present at the time of the killing. State v. Tyson,\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n283 S.C. 375, 323 S.E.2d 770 (1984). \"The sudden heat of passion, upon\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nsufficient legal provocation, which mitigates a felonious killing to\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nmanslaughter, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nknowledge and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nreason, and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nreflection, and produce what, according to human experience, may be called\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nan uncontrollable impulse to do violence.\" State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 474\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nS.E.2d 430 (1996) (internal quotations omitted).\r\n  The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on voluntary\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nmanslaughter because there was no evidence of sudden heat of passion or\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nsufficient legal provocation. Viewed in the light most favorable to Appellant,\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nthe evidence reveals that Pennington assaulted Appellant's friend and stole\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nhis jewelry. Appellant twice fought briefly with Pennington, and was pulled\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\noff Pennington by the victim. Pennington pushed over Appellant's stereo,\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nand then Pennington and the victim left. We do not think these facts\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nconstitute sufficient legal provocation for voluntary manslaughter.\r\n  Furthermore, there was no evidence presented that Appellant was\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\novercome by a sudden heat of passion as would produce an \"uncontrollable\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nimpulse to do violence.\" On the contrary, by Appellant's own testimony, he\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nshot at the men to scare them away. Appellant's testimony appears designed\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nto support a charge of self defense, not heat of passion. Even if Appellant\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nhad been in the heat of passion during the confrontation in his apartment,\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nthree to five minutes had passed in which he had time to go to his mother's\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\napartment and find his gun. Far from passion, these actions indicate \"cool\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nreflection.\" See State v. Walker, 324 S.C. 257, 478 S.E.2d 280 (1996).\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nAppellant admitted that in the time between when Pennington and the\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nvictim went out the front door and he went out the back, he had \"time\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nenough for me to get my head together.\" Most significantly, the men had\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nbeen gone for several minutes when Appellant shot and killed the victim.\r\n  In State v. Cooney, 320 S.C. 107, 463 S.E.2d 597 (1995), the defendant\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nwas convicted of murder for shooting a man who earlier had robbed his store.\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n  The defendant attempted to make a citizen's arrest, and shot the victim as\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nhe tried to run. This Court held the trial judge did not err in declining to\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\ncharge voluntary manslaughter:\r\n  \r\n    There was no evidence presented that appellant was in a sudden\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nheat of passion. The only reason appellant gave for shooting the\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nvictim was because he was escaping. The victim did not attack\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nappellant, nor was he armed. The victim was fifteen to twenty\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nfeet away at the time appellant fired his gun three to four times\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nat the victim. There was no evidence that appellant was\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nprovoked by the victim at the time of the killing.\r\n  \r\n  320 S.C. at 113, 463 S.E.2d at 600. Likewise, in State v. Rogers, 320 S.C.\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\n520, 466 S.E.2d 360 (1996), this Court found a charge of voluntary\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\nmanslaughter unwarranted where the victim was moving away from the\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\ndefendant and made no statements evincing an intent to injure the\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\ndefendant.\r\n  The cases relied upon by Appellant are clearly distinguishable. In State v. Lowry, 315 S.C.396, 434 S.E.2d 272 (1993), this Court found the\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\ntrial judge should have charged voluntary manslaughter where the\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\ndefendant shot the decedent after the decedent taunted the defendant then\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nmoved toward him in a menacing fashion with his arms outstretched as if to\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\ngrab him. Id. at 398, 434 S.E.2d at 273. The Court found a jury could\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nreasonably conclude that when taken together, the menacing words and the\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nactions constituted a legal provocation sufficient to produce sudden heat of\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\npassion. Id. at 399, 434 S.E.2d at 274. In State v. Gardner, 219 S.C. 97, 64\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nS.E.2d 130 (1951), there was evidence the defendant and the victim were in a\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nphysical fight at the time of the stabbing.\r\n  We find no evidence of either heat of passion or sufficient legal\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\nprovocation. The trial judge did not err in refusing to charge voluntary\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\nmanslaughter. We therefore AFFIRM Appellant's conviction.\r\n  TOAL, A.C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Associate\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nJustice George T.

The Court of Appeals reversed. State v. Colf, 332 S.C. 313, 318,\r\n504 S.E.2d 360, 362 (Ct. App. 1998). We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 1996, Respondent was arrested and charged with burglary\r\nand larceny. At his trial, the State was permitted to impeach Respondent\r\nwith his prior convictions for attempted breaking and entering, attempted\r\nlarceny, breaking and entering, larceny, and larceny of a vehicle. The\r\nparties do not dispute the convictions are more than ten years old. However,\r\nthe record does not contain the dates of the convictions. The trial judge gave\r\nthe jury appropriate limiting instructions both at the time of the testimony\r\nand again before it retired to deliberate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Respondent of burglary, but not larceny.\r\nRespondent appealed. The Court of Appeals held the trial court erred in\r\nallowing the State to use evidence of Respondent's prior convictions for\r\nlarceny and breaking and entering to impeach him. It reversed Respondent's\r\nconviction and remanded for a new trial. Id. This Court granted the State's\r\npetition for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision\r\nregarding the admissibility of remote crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding the trial court erred in\r\n    admitting evidence of Respondent's prior convictions?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmission of evidence falls within the trial court's discretion and will\r\nnot be disturbed on appeal absent abuse of that discretion. State v. Huggins,\r\n325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997). The scope of cross-examination is\r\nwithin the discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on\r\nappeal absent a showing of prejudice. State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399\r\nS.E.2d 595 (1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 609(b), SORE, governs the admissibility of remote convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relevant provision states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (b) Time limit. Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not\r\n    admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since\r\n    the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the\r\n    confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later\r\n    date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that\r\n    the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts\r\n    and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the prior\r\nconvictions without conducting a balancing test and articulating for the\r\nrecord specific facts and circumstances to overcome Rule 609(b)'s\r\npresumption against admissibility. The trial judge acknowledged\r\nRespondent would be greatly prejudiced by admitting evidence of his past\r\ncrimes. Nevertheless, the judge articulated no specific facts and\r\ncircumstances to support his ruling admitting the remote convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case raises a novel question in South Carolina. However, since\r\nthe rule is identical to the federal rule, federal cases may be persuasive. The\r\nFourth Circuit has explicitly held that evidence of remote convictions should\r\nonly be admitted for impeachment purposes \"in exceptional circumstances,\"\r\nand that Rule 609(b) requires the trial court to articulate the specific facts\r\nand circumstances supporting its determination that the probative value of\r\nthe evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. United States v.\r\nCavender, 578 F.2d 528 (4th Cir. 1978) (Russell, J.); see also Jack B.\r\nWeinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence Â§\r\n609.06[3] [a] (2d ed. 1999) (\"Courts generally have held that Rule 609(b)\r\nrequires the district court to make a finding on the record that articulates\r\nthe facts and circumstances that justify the admission of conviction\r\nevidence.\"); but see United States v. Spero, 635 F.2d 779, 781 (8th Cir. 1980)\r\n(declining to follow Cavender and require articulation on the record \"at this\r\ntime.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 609(b) establishes a presumption against admissibility of remote\r\nconvictions, United States v: Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 418 (4th Cir. 1981), and the State bears the burden of establishing facts and circumstances sufficient\r\nto substantially overcome that presumption. Id. at 418, see also Cavender,\r\n578 F.2d at 529. In both Cavender and Beahm, the Fourth Circuit reversed\r\nthe defendants' convictions because the trial courts failed to state specific\r\nfacts supporting the probative value of the prior convictions for impeachment\r\npurposes or show how their probative value substantially outweighed their\r\nprejudicial effect. The rule is very clear and we agree with the Fourth\r\nCircuit's analysis in Cavender and Beahm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining whether the probative value of a prior conviction\r\noutweighs its prejudicial effect, federal courts often apply the following five\r\nfactors:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. The impeachment value of the prior crime.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  2. The point in time of the conviction and the witness's\r\n    subsequent history.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  3. The similarity between the past crime and the charged crime.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  4. The importance of the defendant's testimony.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  5. The centrality of the credibility issue.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nJack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence Â§\r\n609.05[3] [a] (2d ed. 1999); Stephen A. Saltzburg, Federal Rules of Evidence\r\nManual 1040 (7th ed. 1998). These factors are not exclusive; trial courts\r\nshould exercise their discretion in light of the facts and circumstances of each\r\nparticular case. See Michael H. Graham; Handbook of Federal Evidence Â§\r\n609.3 (4th ed. 1996) (additional factors may include the defendant's age and\r\ncircumstances, the length of the defendant's criminal record, the likelihood\r\nthe defendant would not testify, and facts surrounding the conviction).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that unlike the prior crimes in Cavender and Beahm,\r\nwhich were sexual in nature, the commission of larceny reflects directly on\r\ncredibility. See State v. Vaughn, 268 S.C. 119, 232 S.E.2d 328 (1977). It\r\ncites a number of cases in which courts affirmed the introduction of remote\r\nconvictions because the convictions directly reflected on credibility, and because the convictions were highly probative where the jury faced a choice\r\nbetween the State's and the defendant's opposing versions of the facts. See,\r\ne.g., United States v. Brown; 956 F.2d 782 (8th Cir. 1992), United States v.\r\nMurray, 751 F.2d 1528 (9th Cir. 1985), United States v. Brown, 603 F.2d\r\n1022 (1st Cir. 1979).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that larceny reflects on credibility and the importance of\r\ncredibility to the jury's decision are both factors the trial court should have\r\nweighed in making the admissibility determination. These factors may or\r\nmay not tip the balance toward admission in any particular case. However,\r\nno such balancing was done in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the trial court clearly misapplied another factor - the\r\nsimilarity between the prior crimes and the crime with which Respondent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas charged. The trial court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  If these prior convictions over ten years old were involving drugs,\r\n    marijuana, peeping tom [sic], anything other than the charge for\r\n    which he's being tried, I would not let it in, but when somebody\r\n    is being tried for grand larceny and he's got six different offenses\r\n    for grand larceny, the interest of justice, in my view, compels me\r\n    to let the jury have that testimony for such weight as they are\r\n    entitled to receive.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Court of Appeals noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Although the trial court clearly considered the rule and the ends\r\n    of justice, the court's comments indicated a belief that the\r\n    convictions were relevant because they related to the same or\r\n    similar offenses as those with which [Respondent] was currently\r\n    charged, and a belief that this similarity heightened their\r\n    probative value.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nColf, 332 S.C. at 318, 504 S.E.2d at 362. In Beahm, the Fourth Circuit Court\r\nof Appeals held the district court erred in apparently finding a remote prior\r\nconviction substantially more probative than prejudicial based on the\r\nsimilarity of the crimes. 664 F.2d at 418-19. On the contrary, the court\r\nnoted, evidence of similar offenses inevitably suggests to the jury the\r\ndefendant's propensity to commit the crime with which he is charged. This\r\nrisk is not eliminated by limiting instructions. Therefore, \"[s]ince evidence of\r\nany similar offense should be admitted only rarely, a similar conviction\r\nalready presumptively barred from admission by Rule 609(b) should be\r\nadmitted even more rarely.\" Id. at 419. The trial judge here erred in\r\ntreating the prior crimes as if their similarity heightened their probative\r\nvalue when it actually increased their prejudicial effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals went on to \"consider in more detail the probative\r\nvalue of these convictions, and whether this probative value `substantially\r\noutweighs' the prejudicial effect.\" Colf, 332 S.C. at 319, 504 S.E.2d at 362.\r\nThis was error. The Court of Appeals should not have undertaken the Rule\r\n609(b) balancing test itself, but should have remanded the question to the\r\ntrial court. In Cavender, the Fourth Circuit noted that it is precisely this\r\nabsence of specific facts and circumstances that causes such cases to defy\r\nappellate review. 578 F.2d at 531. It is difficult, if not impossible, for an\r\nappellate court to balance the interests at stake when the record does not\r\ncontain the specific facts and circumstances necessary to a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe balancing test required by Rule 609(b) must be conducted by the\r\ntrial court. As the trial court noted, Respondent was unquestionably\r\nprejudiced by the admission of his prior crimes. Whether the probative value\r\nof the evidence substantially outweighs that prejudice is a determination the\r\ntrial court should make after carefully balancing the interests involved and\r\narticulating for the record the specific facts and circumstances supporting its\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe AFFIRM the Court of Appeals' opinion as modified and REMANDto the trial court for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25039","title":"Carprood v.

His\r\ndirect appeal was dismissed. His petition for post-conviction relief (PCR) was\r\ngranted. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 20, 1993 between 3:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon, a man\r\nentered a Texaco convenience store directly off Interstate 95 in Colleton\r\nCounty. Ruth Filmon, the employee on duty, was behind the counter\r\nstocking cigarettes when the man entered and asked if the store sold money\r\norders. When Ms. Filmon told him \"no,\" the man walked to the end of the\r\ncounter toward a display, and Ms. Filmon resumed her stocking.. A moment\r\nlater, out of the corner of her eye, she saw the man coming up behind her.\r\nThe man held against her back something sharp and silver she believed was\r\na knife, and ordered Ms. Filmon to give him the money in the cash register.\r\nThe man told Ms. Filmon not to look at him as he left, or he would kill her.\r\nOnce she heard the man leave, Ms. Filmon activated the silent alarm, then\r\ntried to call the police, forgetting the alarm shuts down the telephones. She\r\nthen ran out into the parking lot to get help. As she exited the store, she saw\r\nthe man pull away in a small blue station wagon bearing Florida license tags\r\nand proceed north on I-95. A truck driver in the parking lot called the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the description Ms. Filmon gave the police, the robber was\r\na deeply tanned white male with shoulder length medium brown hair,\r\nthickly parted in the middle and no facial hair. He wore wrap-around,\r\nreflective sunglasses, a white tee shirt and faded, grease-stained blue jeans,\r\nand was approximately 5 feet 9 inches tall and 140 pounds. According to the\r\ntruck driver, the man had tattoos on both shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetective Donald Pooser of the Colleton County Sheriff's Department\r\nwas crossing I-95 on Highway 61 when he observed a small import medium\r\nblue station wagon on I-95. Apparently within moments, a dispatch went out\r\ndescribing the vehicle involved in the Texaco robbery, and Detective Pooser\r\npursued the vehicle. Traffic was heavy and he was unable to regain sight of\r\nthe vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Detective Ted Stanfield, also of the Colleton County\r\nSheriff's Department, was responding to a call regarding an earlier armed\r\nrobbery in Jasper County when he heard the dispatch about the Texaco\r\nrobbery. Both robberies involved vehicles of the same description and both\r\nwere said to be proceeding north on I-95. Several other Colleton County\r\nofficers joined the pursuit. Soon thereafter, Detective Stanfield heard Detective Pooser's transmission of the vehicle sighting. Knowing Detective\r\nPooser was not in a patrol car, Detective Stanfield radioed ahead to\r\nClarendon County, asking the Sheriff's Department to set up a roadblock for\r\nthe suspect vehicle. When the officers reached the roadblock, they realized\r\nthe vehicle must have exited the interstate. As they searched for the vehicle,\r\nthey received a call from Clarendon County and Summerton police about a\r\nthird armed robbery involving the same described vehicle. The Summerton\r\npolice caught the vehicle and rammed it, but the driver escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Clarendon County gathered manpower, dogs, and a helicopter team\r\nto search for the fleeing suspect, Detective Stanfield took photographs and\r\nhelped inventory the vehicle. Among other things, the vehicle contained 71\r\none dollar bills in the glove compartment, $14.50 in rolled coins, an Old\r\nHickory knife, and two pairs of wrap-around sunglasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe suspect captured was Respondent. He was dressed in dark jeans\r\nand a light gray tank top, and had tattoos on both shoulders. He had some\r\nlight facial hair, though not a full moustache and goatee. Officers found an\r\nadditional $296 in Respondent's sock, $61.11 in his wallet, $150 in a pocket,\r\nand $6.71 in another pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent's questions at PCR suggest that at some point after the\r\narrest, Ms. Filmon identified]Respondent from a photographic lineup\r\nprepared for Clarendon County. His questions also indicate officers\r\nattempted a physical lineup which was aborted because Respondent was\r\nfighting with the police. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Filmon moved out of South\r\nCarolina. Five months after the robbery, Detective Stanfield composed a\r\nphotographic lineup and flew to Ms. Filmon's home to show it to her. From\r\nthat lineup, Ms. Filmon identified Respondent. She also made an in-court\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Respondent of armed robbery, and he was\r\nsentenced to 20 years, consecutive to time he was already serving.1\r\nRespondent's direct appeal was dismissed. The PCR judge granted Respondent's petition for PCR based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nThis Court granted the State's petition for writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Did the PCR court err in granting relief on the grounds that defense\r\ncounsel was deficient in waiving Respondent's right to cross examine\r\nwitnesses and allowing prejudicial hearsay evidence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Did the PCR court err in granting relief on the grounds that\r\ndefense counsel was deficient in not moving for a mistrial or objecting when\r\nwitnesses for the State referred to other crimes Respondent may have\r\ncommitted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Waiver of Right of Cross Examination\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCR court ruled defense counsel was ineffective in waiving\r\nRespondent's right to cross examine witnesses and allowing in prejudicial\r\nhearsay evidence. The court concluded counsel was ineffective in four\r\nparticulars:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1) He did not move to strike or ask for limiting instructions when his\r\n    objection to a hearsay description of the getaway car was sustained;\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  2) He introduced into evidence a report by Detective Medlar containing\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    a) a hearsay description of the car given by an absent witness,\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n    b) reference to an armed robbery in Clarendon County and a\r\n      statement that Respondent committed the crime,\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n    c) a hearsay description of the robber and the robbery\r\n      by the victim;\r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n  \r\n  3) He asked Detective Medlar to read the description of the suspect\r\n  given to him by the uncalled witness;\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  4) He did not object when the State exceeded the scope of redirect\r\n  examination and introduced hearsay evidence by asking Detective\r\n  Medlar for a description of the getaway car given mainly by an\r\n  uncalled witness.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate\r\nassistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all\r\nsignificant decisions in a case. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668\r\n(1984), Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). Strickland set\r\nforth a two-prong test for determining ineffective assistance of counsel,\r\nadopted by this Court in Cherry. First, Respondent must show that his\r\ncounsel's performance was deficient based on a standard of \"reasonableness\r\nunder prevailing professional norms.\" Id. Second, Respondent must show\r\nthat the deficient performance prejudiced Respondent to the extent that\r\n\"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional\r\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Id. The PCR\r\napplicant has the burden of proving both prongs. McCray v. State, 317 S.C.\r\n557, 559, 455 S.E.2d 686, 687 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR court's findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law. McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995).\r\nThe existence in the record of \"any evidence\" of probative value is sufficient\r\nto uphold the PCR judge's ruling. Webb v. State, 281 S.C. 237, 314 S.E.2d\r\n839 (1984).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no probative evidence in the record to support the PCR court's\r\nruling on this issue. First, defense counsel testified at the PCR hearing that\r\nas a trial strategy, he did not request curative instructions because they tend\r\nto bring into focus precisely the item the objector has kept out. Where\r\ncounsel articulates a valid reason for employing certain strategy, such\r\nconduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel. Stokes v. State,\r\n308 S.C. 546, 419 S.E.2d 778 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, the descriptions of the suspect vehicle and the perpetrator\r\ncontained in Detective Medlar's report were cumulative to testimony given at\r\ntrial by Ms. Filmon, the victim. It is unclear how much of the description in\r\nthe report came from Ms. Filmon and how much came from the uncalled\r\nwitness. At most, it appears that the foreign make of the car and the\r\ndescription of the tattoos on Respondent's arms came from the uncalled\r\nwitness alone. In any case, Ms. Filmon thoroughly described the car at trial,\r\nincluding the Florida license plate. She also identified Respondent in both\r\nthe lineup and in court. With Ms. Filmon's testimony and the ample\r\ncircumstantial evidence linking Respondent to the crime, there is no\r\nreasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been\r\ndifferent without the minimal hearsay. Furthermore, defense counsel\r\nintroduced the police report to show the jury the ways in which the\r\ndescription of the robber differed from that of Respondent. This was a valid\r\ntrial strategy, and should not be the basis of a finding of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel. See id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Detective Medlar's report does not refer to the armed robbery\r\nin Clarendon or state that Respondent committed that crime. The PCR\r\ncourt's ruling on that basis is therefore clearly erroneous.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Failure to Object or Move for Mistrial\r\n  Based on Reference to Other Crimes\r\nThe PCR court also ruled defense counsel was ineffective in failing to\r\nobject or move for a mistrial based on numerous references by police officers\r\nto other crimes. We address these references separately below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Clarendon and Jasper County Robberies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the references to other crimes were made in the course of the\r\nofficers describing their pursuit of the vehicle involved in the various\r\nrobberies in the tri-county area that day, as set forth above.3 Specifically,\r\nthe PCR court found these statements concerning the other robberies\r\nconstituted hearsay and they were not established by clear and convincing\r\nevidence and therefore were not admissible under any of the exceptions in\r\nState v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923). The State asserts three\r\nbases for admitting the statements: (1) they are not hearsay, (2) they fall into\r\na Lyle exception, and (3) they form part of the res gestae. We agree the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPROOD v. STATE\r\nstatements are not hearsay and do not address the State's other grounds for\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence is not hearsay unless it is an out of court statement offered to\r\nprove the truth of the matter asserted. State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 63, 451\r\nS.E.2d 888, 894 (1994) (internal citations omitted). An out of court\r\nstatement is not hearsay if it is offered for the limited purpose of explaining\r\nwhy a government investigation was undertaken. Id. In Brown, the Court\r\nheld police officers' testimony about complaints they had received in the\r\nneighborhood prior to setting up their surveillance was admissible for the\r\nnonhearsay purpose of explaining why officers began their surveillance of\r\ndefendant's apartment. The officers' statements here were similar to those\r\nin Brown in that in both cases the officers were explaining their actions in\r\npursuing the defendants and the statements were not offered for their truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Rap Sheet Testimony\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring cross examination, defense counsel asked Detective Stanfield\r\nwhether he ran a license check on Respondent. Counsel's intent was to elicit\r\nfrom the officer the fact that Respondent was driving under suspension, to\r\nexplain why Respondent ran. The following dialogue ensued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A: A license check? Yes sir, I ran a rap sheet and\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Q: Did the Defendant have - the Defendant was driving under\r\n    suspension, was he not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  A: I believe there was some type of violation, also.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Q: I-\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  The Court: Wait just a minute. Wait a minute. Come forward, please.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the subsequent bench conference, the court admonished Detective\r\nStanfield and stated, \"No harm has been done in my opinion, but you came\r\ndangerously close to jeopardizing this trial . . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence of other crimes or bad acts is inadmissible to show propensity\r\nto commit a crime. Rule 404(b), SORE. The PCR court ruled counsel was\r\nineffective in failing to act to protect his client's interests when Detective\r\nStanfield referred to Respondent's \"rap sheet\" and \"some type of violation.\"\r\nThe State has not appealed that ruling. It is therefore the law of the case and this Court will not consider it. ML-Lee Acquisition Fund v. Deloitte &amp;\r\nTouche, 327 S.C. 238, 489 S.E.2d 470 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reverse the PCR court's ruling that defense counsel was deficient in\r\nwaiving Respondent's right to cross examine witnesses and in not moving for\r\na mistrial or objecting when witnesses for the State referred to other armed\r\nrobberies that took place that day. Because the State has not appealed the\r\nPCR court's ruling that counsel was deficient in failing to protect his client's\r\ninterests when a witness referred to Respondent's \"rap sheet,\" that ruling is\r\nthe law of the case, and Respondent is entitled to a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Respondent pled guilty to the Clarendon County robbery and was given a sentence of 21 years. A jury in Jasper County acquitted him of the third robbery. \r\n2 The PCR court apparently confused Detective Medlar's report with one made by Detective Stanfield, which was not introduced at Respondent's trial. \r\n3 The references to other crimes not taking place that same day are addressed in part II.B.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25040","title":"State v.

A leather coat, jewelry, money, and a\r\ncellular telephone were missing. The perpetrator had cut the screen window\r\non the back porch, opened the kitchen window, and entered the apartment\r\nthrough the window above the kitchen sink. Appellant's palm print was\r\nfound on the kitchen counter. The print faced the interior of the kitchen,\r\nindicating it was made while entering through the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. As interpreted in State v. Hamilton,1 is S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2)(Supp. 1998) unconstitutional? \r\n  II. Did the trial judge err by denying appellant's request to\r\n    give a circumstantial evidence charge?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecognizing a conviction for first degree burglary necessitated\r\nthe State prove he had two prior convictions for burglary and/or\r\nhousebreaking,2 appellant offered to stipulate he had two prior burglary\r\nconvictions in lieu of the State introducing evidence of the convictions before\r\nthe jury. Appellant asserted the trial judge could consider the prior\r\nconvictions at sentencing. The State refused to accept the stipulation.\r\nRelying on State v. Hamilton, id., the trial judge declined to require the\r\nprosecution to accept appellant's stipulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues \"Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2), as interpreted in State v.\r\nHamilton, is unconstitutional because evidence required to prove the status\r\nelement of prior convictions dilutes the State's burden of proof with respect\r\nto the remaining.elements of the offense.\" He claims admission of the prior\r\ncrimes is highly prejudicial and deprives a defendant of due process of law.3\r\n We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A) provides: \r\n  A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person\r\n    enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a\r\n    crime in the dwelling, and . . .\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  (2) the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of\r\n    two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a\r\n    combination of both; . . . .\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nTo deter repeat offenders, the General Assembly chose to include\r\ntwo or more prior burglary and/or housebreaking convictions as an element\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof first degree burglary. The United States Supreme Court has held this is a\r\nvalid state purpose which does not violate due process. Spencer v. Texas,\r\n385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967). We agree. Section 16-11\r\n311(A)(2) does not violate due process as it is reasonably designed to\r\naccomplish its purpose. State v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 484 S.E.2d 869\r\n(1997)(to meet the requirements of due process, a challenged act must be\r\nreasonably designed to accomplish its purposes, unless some fundamental\r\nright or suspect class is involved). Facially, Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2) does not\r\nviolate due process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Hamilton, supra, the Court of Appeals held because\r\ntwo prior burglary and/or housebreaking convictions are an element of first\r\ndegree burglary under Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2), the defendant cannot require the\r\nState to stipulate to the prior convictions in lieu of informing the jury about\r\nthe prior convictions. This holding does not dilute the State's burden of proof\r\nin violation of due process. The State is still required to prove all the\r\nelements of first degree burglary beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship,\r\n397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375 (1970)(\"[t1he Due\r\nProcess Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime\r\nwith which he is charged.\"). Furthermore, due process does not bar the\r\nadmission of prior crimes simply because there is an accompanying\r\nprejudicial effect. Spencer v. Texas, supra at 564, S.Ct. at 654, L.Ed.2d at\r\n614 (\"[i]n the face of the legitimate state purpose and the long-standing and\r\nwidespread use that attend the procedure under attack here, we find it\r\nimpossible to say that because of the possibility of some collateral prejudice\r\nthe [state] procedure is rendered unconstitutional under the Due Process\r\nClause as it has been interpreted and applied in our past cases.\"); see State\r\nv. Hornsby, supra (a denial of due process occurs when a defendant in a\r\ncriminal trial is denied the fundamental fairness essential to the concept of\r\njustice). Accordingly, as applied in State v. Hamilton, supra, Â§ 16-11\r\n311(A)(2) is constitutional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, we note evidence of other crimes is admissible to\r\nestablish a material fact or element of the crime charged. State v. Johnson,\r\n293 S.C. 321, 360 S.E.2d 317 (1987). Even in Old Chief v. United States, 519\r\nU.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), upon which appellant relies,\r\nevidence of the defendant's prior felony conviction, an element of the\r\nweapons charge for which he was on trial, was admissible. Because the\r\nname and nature of the prior conviction were irrelevant (they were not\r\nelements of the current charge), their probative value was outweighed by\r\ntheir prejudicial effect.4 For purposes of an element of first degree burglary\r\nunder Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2), we conclude the probative value of admitting the\r\ndefendant's prior burglary and/or housebreaking convictions is not\r\noutweighed by its prejudicial effect. Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, while generally inadmissible, propensity evidence is not\r\nprohibited. Propensity evidence is admissible if offered for some purpose\r\nother than to show the accused is a bad person or he acted in conformity with\r\nhis prior convictions. Rule 404, SCRE (evidence of other crimes is not\r\nadmissible to prove character to show action in conformity but to show\r\nmotive, absence of mistake or accident, intent, identity, the existence of\r\ncommon scheme or plan). Here, appellant's two prior burglary convictions\r\nwere offered to prove a statutory element of the current first degree burglary\r\ncharge, not to suggest appellant was a bad person or committed the present\r\nburglary because he had committed prior burglaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ensure a defendant is not convicted on an improper basis\r\nwhile allowing the State to prove the elements of first degree burglary, the\r\ntrial court should limit evidence to the prior burglary and/or housebreaking\r\nconvictions, as it did here. Particular information regarding the prior crimes\r\nshould not be admitted. Additionally, the trial court, as it did here, should,\r\non request, instruct the jury on the limited purpose for which the prior crime\r\nevidence can be considered. Rule 105, SCRE (when evidence is admissible\r\nfor one purpose but not for another, the court, upon request, shall restrict the\r\nevidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge erred by failing to give a\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge. He claims the charge was required as the\r\npalm print was circumstantial evidence of the perpetrator's identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, appellant agreed the palm print was direct evidence, but\r\nargued the element of \"intent to commit a crime therein\" was only\r\nestablished by circumstantial evidence. The trial judge declined to charge\r\ncircumstantial evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant's present issue is not preserved for appellate\r\nconsideration as he previously conceded the palm print was direct evidence.\r\nTNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Dept of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d\r\n471 (1998)(an issue conceded in the trial court cannot be argued on appeal).\r\nMoreover, appellant argued one ground in support of a circumstantial\r\nevidence charge at trial (State only presented circumstantial evidence of\r\nintent) and argues another ground in support of the charge on appeal (palm\r\nprint is circumstantial evidence). State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d\r\n263 (1995)(a party cannot argue one ground below and then argue another\r\nground on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe AFFIRM appellant's conviction and sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 327 S.C. 440, 486 S.E.2d 512 (Ct.

Further, as respondent continued to\r\npractice law in South Carolina during the period of his Georgia disbarment\r\nand suspension, he neglected to remove from his South Carolina letterhead a\r\nmisleading statement indicating that he was admitted to practice in\r\nGeorgia.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nRespondent has engaged in conduct which violates the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR. Respondent failed to consult with\r\nhis clients. Rule 1.2. He failed to act with reasonable diligence. Rule 1.3.\r\nHe failed to communicate with his clients and respond to requests for\r\ninformation. Rule 1.4(a). Respondent gave misleading information in his\r\noffice letterhead. Rule 7.1. He committed professional misconduct by\r\nviolating the Rules of Professional Conduct. Rule 8.4(a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, respondent has engaged in conduct constituting\r\nviolations of Rules 7 &amp; 29 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement,\r\nRule 413, SCACR. He violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\nSCACR. Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE. He failed to report his Federal District Court\r\ndisbarment and his suspension by the Georgia Supreme Court. Rule 29(a),\r\nRLDE. He engaged in conduct tending to bring the courts and the legal\r\nprofession into disrepute. Rule 7(a)(5), RLDE.\r\nAccordingly, we reprimand respondent.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1On September 13, 1999, pursuant to Rule 29(d), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, this Court reciprocally disciplined respondent based upon the sanctions imposed by the Federal District Court and Georgia Supreme Court. This Court suspended respondent's license to practice law in the State of South Carolina for an aggregate period of one year, retroactive to March 8, 1999. In the Matter of John L. Creson, S.C. Sup.

Pierce, II (respondent) entered a plea of nolo contendere.to a charge of using his official position or office for financial gain, and was fined $700. Respondent did not appeal his conviction or sentence. A circuit judge granted post conviction relief (PCR) to respondent after an evidentiary hearing. We granted petitioner's (the State's) petition for a writ of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertiorari, and now reverse.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent, then a highway patrol trooper, stopped a motorist on\r\nOctober 25, 1991, for driving under the influence, third offense. He agreed to\r\ncharge the motorist with DUI, first offense, in exchange for the motorist's 1965\r\npickup truck. Respondent took possession of the truck December 4, 1991. A\r\ngrand jury indicted respondent January 23, 1992, for violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n8-13-410 (1986). At the time respondent committed the alleged offense, Section\r\n8-13-410 stated that \"[n]o public official or public employee shall use his official\r\nposition or office to obtain financial gain for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Ethics, Government Accountability, and Campaign Reform Act\r\nof 1991\" took effect January 1,1992. Act No. 248, 1991 Acts 1578,1652. The Act\r\nincluded a new provision that replaced Section 8-13-410: \"No public official,\r\npublic member, or public employee may knowingly use his official office,\r\nmembership, or employment to obtain an economic interest for himself, a\r\nmember of his immediate family, an individual with whom he is associated, or\r\na business with which he is associated.\" Act. No. 248 Â§ 3, 1991 Acts 1616\r\n(codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 700(A) (Supp. 1998)) (emphasis added). The new\r\nstatute requires the State to prove a defendant \"knowingly\" committed a\r\nviolation, while the former statute did not specify the required level of criminal\r\nintent, or mens rea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent entered a plea of nolo contendere March 2, 1992. The\r\nplea judge found that Section 8-13-410 had been repealed by the 1991 Ethics Act,\r\nbut believed the statute still applied in respondent's case because respondent\r\ncommitted the offense in 1991 before the statute was repealed. Respondent's\r\nplea counsel agreed. Respondent, who faced a misdemeanor charge with a\r\nmaximum sentence of $1,000 and ninety days in jail, was fined $700.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his PCR application and at the hearing, respondent alleged his\r\nplea attorney was ineffective in failing to tell him that Section 8-13-410 had been\r\nrepealed by the 1991 Ethics Act and that the State, under Section 8-13-700(A),\r\nwould have to prove he \"knowingly\" committed the offense. Respondent also\r\nalleged his attorney was ineffective in not realizing that the repeal of Section 8-13-410 nullified any indictment based on that statute, thus depriving the circuit\r\ncourt of subject matter jurisdiction to accept his plea. The PCR judge agreed\r\nwith respondent's arguments and granted him relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Did the PCR judge err in ruling that respondent's\r\n    counsel provided ineffective assistance because the\r\n    State would have to prove respondent \"knowingly\" committed the offense under the new statute? \r\n  2. Did the PCR judge err in ruling that counsel provided\r\n    ineffective assistance because the repeal of Section 8-13-410 meant the plea judge lacked subject matter\r\n    jurisdiction to accept respondent's plea?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n1. APPLICATION OF NEW STATUTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge erred in ruling that respondent's\r\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance. The new statute does not apply in\r\nrespondent's case and, if the case had gone to trial, the State would not have had\r\nto prove respondent \"knowingly\" committed the offense under the new statute,\r\nthe State contends. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a\r\nPCR applicant must prove counsel's performance was deficient and the deficient\r\nperformance prejudiced the applicant's case. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\r\n668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386\r\nS.E.2d 624 (1989). Where there has been a guilty plea, the applicant must prove\r\ncounsel's representation fell below the standard of reasonableness and, but for\r\ncounsel's unprofessional errors, there is a reasonable probability he would not\r\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. Hill v. Lockhart,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985); Alexander v. State, 303 S.C.\r\n539, 402 S.E.2d 484 (1991). Thus, an applicant must show both error and\r\nprejudice to win relief in a PCR proceeding. Scott v. State, 334 S.C. 248, 513\r\nS.E.2d 100 (1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any\r\nevidence of probative value to support them. Cherry v. State, supra. We will not uphold the findings when there is no probative evidence to support them.\r\nHolland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996). Furthermore, we will\r\nreverse the PCR judge's decision when it is controlled by an error of law. See\r\nSimpson v. State, 317 S.C. 506, 455 S.E.2d 175 (1995) (reversing grant of PCR\r\nwhere judge, who erroneously believed guilty plea had to be acknowledged by\r\ndefendant in writing, vacated plea because defendant had signed an incorrect\r\nplea).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, we note this case presents the \"flip side\" of a typical ex post\r\nfacto claim. The application of a new or amended criminal statute may prompt\r\na defendant to allege a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause,2 arguing the court\r\nmay not apply a statute enacted or amended after the date of an offense in his\r\ncase. E.g., State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 28 n.4, 495 S.E.2d 202, 205 n.4 (1998)\r\n(element of criminal offense that was altered by Court after the date of alleged\r\noffense was not applied in defendant's case because that would result in ex post\r\nfacto or due process violation); State v. Huiett, 302 S.C. 169, 171, 394 S.E.2d\r\n486, 487 (1990) (to fall within the ex post facto prohibition, a law must be\r\nretrospective so as to apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must\r\ndisadvantage the offender affected by it). Respondent presents the opposite\r\nallegation, contending the court must apply in his case a statute that took effect\r\nafter he committed the alleged offense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crucial question is whether the Legislature repealed or amended\r\nSection 8-13-410 by passing Section 8-13-700(A) as part of the 1991 Ethics Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The longstanding common law view is that a\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  continued prosecution necessarily depend[s] upon the\r\n    continued life of the statute which the prosecution seeks\r\n    to apply. In case a statute is repealed or rendered\r\n    inoperative, no further proceedings can be had to\r\n    enforce it in pending prosecutions unless competent\r\n    authority has kept the statute alive for that purpose: .\r\n    . . Prosecution for crimes is but an application or\r\n    enforcement of the law, and if the prosecution continues\r\n    the law must continue to vivify it.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 223-26, 54 S.Ct. 434, 435-36, 78 L.Ed.\r\n763, 765-67 (1934).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina follows this common law rule. The parties have not\r\ncited and we have not found any statutory or constitutional provision containing\r\na general saving clause for repealed criminal statutes.3 Cf. 1 U.S.C.A. Â§ 109\r\n(1997) (general federal saving statute); Annot., 5 A.L.R.2d 1270 (1949)\r\n(discussing impact of other states' constitutional provisions affecting repeal or\r\namendment of statutes).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, a criminal defendant may not be convicted under a repealed\r\nstatute when the repealing act does not contain a saving clause. See State v.\r\nRider, 320 S.C. 533, 466 S.E.2d 367 (1996) (vacating conviction where stalking\r\nstatute was expressly repealed and new statute substituted in its place, and the\r\nrepealing act did not contain a saving clause); State v. Defee, 246 S.C. 555, 144\r\nS.E.2d 806 (1965) (upholding the dismissal of an indictment for violation of\r\nobscenity statute where new obscenity statute became effective after alleged\r\nviolation but before trial; act containing new statute did not contain saving\r\nclause and was broad enough in scope to repeal previous statute); State v.\r\nSpencer, 177 S.C. 346, 355-56, 181 S.E. 217, 221 (1935) (vacating conviction\r\nwhere Prohibition Era laws under which defendant was convicted were expressly\r\nrepealed by act legalizing the possession and sale of alcoholic beverages); State\r\nv. Lee, 33 S.E. 351 (1899) (court does not have subject matter jurisdiction in\r\nprosecution of defendant when statute making the alleged offense a crime has\r\nbeen repealed); 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 29 (1989) (general rule is that repeal\r\nof a criminal statute without a saving clause ends prosecution and punishment);\r\nsee also Taylor v. Murphy, 293 S.C. 316, 318-19, 360 S.E.2d 314, 316 (1987)\r\n(stating in tort case that \"[t]he general rule is that the repeal of a statute\r\noperates retrospectively, and has the effect of blotting the statute out completely\r\nas if it had never existed and of putting an end to all proceedings under it which\r\nhave not been prosecuted to final judgment\"). The obvious rationale for the\r\ncommon law rule is that \"the extinction of the statute is understood to be an\r\nindication that the sovereign power no longer desires the former crime to be\r\npunished or regarded as criminal.\" State v. Spencer, 177 S.C. at 357, 181 S.E.\r\nat 222.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court has indicated, however, that a pending prosecution of a\r\ndefendant may continue when a criminal statute is amended, but not repealed.\r\n\"[A] statutory change in the punishment for a crime does not have the effect of\r\nimpairing a prosecution pending at the time of the enactment of .the statutory\r\nchange, except to the extent of the punishment to be imposed.\" State v. Gilliam,\r\n208 S.C. 126, 130, 37 S.E.2d 299, 301(1946) (finding indictment for violation of\r\nformer alcoholic beverage statutes was valid even though Legislature modified\r\nstatutes during pending prosecution, and the repealing act contained a saving\r\nclause); accord State v. Varner, 310 S.C. 264, 265, 423 S.E.2d 133, 134 (1992)\r\n(correct penalty generally is the one in effect at the time of sentencing, although\r\ncommon law prohibits imposition of punishment that exceeds punishment\r\nprovided for when offense was committed).4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe already have decided that the legislative intent of the 1991\r\nEthics Act was to amend the former Ethics Act rather than to repeal it. State v.\r\nThrift, 312 S.C. 282, 304-06, 440 S.E.2d 341, 354 (1994). We explained that the\r\n1991 Act did not expressly repeal the antibribery statute at issue in Thrift; nor\r\ndid the 1991 Act contain a saving clause addressed to the statute.5 Similarly, the\r\n1991 Act did not expressly repeal Section 8-13-410; nor does it contain a saving\r\nclause addressed to Section 8-13-410.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legislature did not decriminalize the offenses. \"The 1991 Ethics\r\nAct reenacts in a different article a more comprehensive series of statutes which\r\naddress in greater depth the conduct formerly violative of [the statute at issue]. \"\r\nState v. Thrift, 312 S.C. at 304, 440 S.E.2d at 353-54. We concluded, therefore,\r\nthat the Legislature intended for the indictment and pending prosecution of\r\ndefendants under provisions of the former Ethics Act to remain valid after the\r\neffective date of the 1991 Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did not explicitly state in Thrift that the State would have to\r\nprove its case under the terms of the former statute, not the amended statute.\r\nThe import of our holding, however, is that a prosecution for an offense occurring\r\nprior to the effective date of the 1991 Ethics Act should proceed under the former\r\nstatute. The following commentary is instructive:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [I]f there is no applicable saving provision, does the\r\n    amendment impliedly repeal the old statute so as to\r\n    prevent further prosecutions thereunder, under the\r\n    common law rule . . . that repeals operate to bar further\r\n    prosecutions in the absence of saving provisions? Some\r\n    cases have so held, but it seems clear that the\r\n    legislature can hardly have intended by its amendment\r\n    that the conduct in question should no longer, be\r\n    prosecuted (the rationale of the common law rule of\r\n    repeal); so other states adopt the better view that the\r\n    old statute is still available for prosecution of those who\r\n    violated it before its amendment.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nLafave and Scott, Criminal Law, Â§ 13 (1972); see also 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§\r\n28 (1989) (general rule is that statutory amendment, unless it is deemed an\r\nimplied repeal, does not affect the prosecution of a crimes occurring before\r\neffective date of amendment; in such cases the original statute remains in force).\r\nOther courts similarly have upheld convictions obtained under a former statute\r\nwhen that statute is amended during a pending prosecution, although some have\r\ndone so under the authority of a general saving clause contained in the statutes\r\nor state constitutions.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold, as we did in State v. Thrift, supra, that the 1991 Ethics Act\r\nwas an amendment of the former Ethics Act, and did not repeal it. Consequently,\r\nthe indictment and pending prosecution of respondent under Section 8-13-410\r\n(the former statute) for acts he allegedly committed prior to the 1991 Act\r\nremained valid after passage of the 1991 Act. If the case had gone to trial, the\r\nState would have had to prove its case under the terms of Section 8-13-410.\r\nSection 8-13-700(A) (the amended statute) and its mens rea requirement of\r\n\"knowingly\" were irrelevant to the prosecution of respondent, and respondent's\r\ncounsel was not ineffective in failing to raise the issue at respondent's plea\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude the PCR judge erred because the record contains no\r\nprobative evidence supporting the grant of relief to respondent. Respondent has\r\nshown neither error nor prejudice. Moreover, the judge's decision was controlled\r\nby an error of law, i.e., his belief that a pending prosecution could not continue\r\nunder the former statute but had to proceed under the new statute. Accordingly,\r\nwe reverse the judge's grant of relief to respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge erred in ruling that counsel provided\r\nineffective assistance, contending the plea judge had subject matter jurisdiction\r\nto accept respondent's plea. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and\r\ndetermine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.\r\nDove v. Gold Kist. Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598 (1994). \"Except for certain\r\nminor offenses, the circuit court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear\r\na guilty plea unless (1) there has been an indictment which sufficiently states the\r\noffense; (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser\r\nincluded charge of the crime charged in the indictment.\" Carter v. State, 329\r\nS.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Legislature had repealed Section 8-13-410, an indictment\r\nbrought under that section would not have given the court subject matter\r\njurisdiction to accept respondent's plea. State v. Lee, 33 S.E. 351. However; as\r\nexplained in Issue 1, we determined in State v. Thrift, supra, that the 1991\r\nEthics Act amended - but did not repeal - provisions contained in the former\r\nEthics Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold that the indictment and prosecution of respondent under\r\nSection 8-13-410 remained valid, and the circuit court had jurisdiction to accept\r\nthe plea. The PCR judge's ruling was based on his erroneous conclusion that a\r\npending prosecution could not continue under the former statute, Section 8-13-410, but had to proceed under the new statute, Section 8-13-700(A). Accordingly,\r\nwe reverse the judge's decision to grant relief to respondent because it is not\r\nsupported by probative evidence and also was controlled by an error of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reverse the grant of PCR to respondent and reinstate his\r\nconviction and sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Although respondent did not receive a prison sentence, he has standing to bring a PCR action because he alleged the conviction has affected his ability to get a job in law enforcement.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nKinloch was accused of the August 27, 1994 murder of Venus Murphy, a\r\nprostitute. Murphy's skull had been crushed with a cement block. Kinloch\r\nadmitted having consensual sex with Murphy sometime after midnight on\r\nAugust 27th, but maintained he had left Murphy between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m.\r\nKinloch did not testify at trial. However, he presented the testimony of\r\nhis nephew, Kevin Molen, to the effect that Molen had seen Kinloch come home\r\naround 5:30 a.m. and go to sleep.1 Around 6:30 a.m., Molen saw Kinloch's ex\r\ngirlfriend, Barbara Milligan, wearing a pair of white pants, walk to the\r\nclothesline and retrieve a pair of blue pants and a white shirt. She went into\r\nan abandoned house in the back yard and came out wearing the blue pants.\r\nShe put the white pants into a trash bag. The trash bag was subsequently\r\ndiscovered by police and the white pants had blood spatters which matched the\r\nDNA analysis of both Murphy and Kinloch. According to Molen, Kinloch was\r\nnot wearing white pants when he came home at 5:30 a.m.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent to Molen's testimony, defense counsel proffered the\r\ntestimony of Shirley Robinson,1 to the effect that, a couple of months after\r\nMurphy's death, Robinson \"met up\" with Barbara Milligan. The two were\r\nsmoking crack cocaine together when Milligan told Robinson she \"got that bitch\r\nfor fucking with my man.\" Kinloch contended the statement should be admitted\r\nas a \"declaration against Milligan's penal interest.\" The trial court refused to\r\nallow Milligan's statement into evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in refusing to permit Kinloch to introduce the\r\n    hearsay statement of Milligan?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Doctor, 306 S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (1992), we first adopted\r\nthe rule that out-of-court statements against penal interest made by an\r\nunavailable declarant are admissible at trial. However, if offered to exculpate\r\nthe accused in a criminal trial, they are admissible only if corroborating\r\nevidence clearly indicates the trustworthiness of the statements. See also\r\nState v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641 (1996). An abuse of discretion\r\nstandard is applied to a trial judge's ruling on the issue of whether a statement\r\nis admissible as a declaration against penal interest. Forney, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 804(b)(3), SORE, codified this exception to the hearsay rule. State\r\nv. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584 (1999). Rule 804(b)(3) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatement Against Interest. A statement which was at the time of\r\nits making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or\r\nproprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil\r\nor criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant\r\nagainst another, that a reasonable person in the declarant's\r\nposition would not have made the statement unless believing it to\r\nbe true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to\r\ncriminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not\r\nadmissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement. (emphasis\r\nsupplied).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not previously engaged in an in depth analysis of the precise\r\ndegree of corroboration prerequisite to admission of a declaration against penal\r\ninterest. Other courts, however, hold the party offering the statement bears a\r\n\"formidable burden\" in meeting the requirements of Rule 804(b)(3). United\r\nStates v. Lowe, 65 F.3d 1137, 1146 (4th Cir.1995) see also United States v.\r\nSalvador, 820 F.2d 558, 561 (2d Cir. 1987) (corroborating circumstances must\r\nbe strong, not merely allowable); United States v. Mackey,117 F.3d 24, 28-9 (15`\r\nCir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S.Ct. 431 (1997) (corroborating circumstances\r\nrequirement not unrealistically severe, but goes \"beyond minimal\r\ncorroboration,\" and trial court has substantial discretion in making finding on\r\ntrustworthiness). According to Weinstein, the rule does not require that the\r\ninformation within the statement be clearly corroborated, it means only\r\nthat there be corroborating circumstances which clearly indicate the\r\ntrustworthiness of the statement itself, i.e., that the statement was actually\r\nmade. The corroboration requirement is a preliminary determination as to the\r\nstatement's admissibility, not an ultimate determination about the statement's\r\ntruth. 5 Weinstein's Federal Evidence, Â§ 804.06(5)(a) (2d Ed. 1999).4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, we cannot say Milligan's alleged statement to Robin son has such\r\n  clearly corroborating circumstances as to warrant its admission. Robinson\r\ntestified Milligan made the statement after smoking crack cocaine. The fact\r\nthat the alleged declarant had been smoking crack cocaine clearly reflects\r\nadversely on both Milligan's trustworthiness, and the trustworthiness of\r\nwhether the statement was, in fact, made. Accord United States v. MacDonald,\r\n688 F.2d 224 (4th Cir.1982)(declarant's drug use rendered her inherently\r\nunreliable and trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding alleged\r\ndeclaration against penal interest). Moreover, Robinson testified Milligan made\r\nthe statement a couple of months or a month after the victim's death. The\r\nvictim died in August 1994 which would mean Milligan made the statement to\r\nRobinson around October 1994. However, Robinson was in jail until November\r\n1994, and Milligan was in prison until April 1995. Accordingly, the\r\ncircumstances do not clearly indicate that the statement was not fabricated.\r\nUnited States v. Brainard, supra. Accord United States v. Bagley, 537 F.2d\r\n162, 167 (5th Cir. 1976) (excluding statement on basis of doubt as to whether it\r\nwas made).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKinloch nonetheless contends the testimony of his cousin Molen to the\r\neffect that he witnessed Milligan putting white pants in a trash bag outside\r\nKinloch's house on the morning after the murder is sufficiently corroborative.\r\nWhile Molen's testimony may be some evidence of corroboration, it is not, in\r\nour opinion, so clearly corroborating as to render the trial court's exclusion of\r\nthis testimony an abuse of discretion. Accord United States v. Salvadore, 820\r\nF.2d at 561 (inference of trustworthiness from proffered corroborating\r\ncircumstances must be strong, not merely allowable, not an insignificant\r\nhurdle); United States v. McDonald, supra (notwithstanding defendant was able\r\nto point to a number of corroborating circumstances, he did not demonstrate,\r\nfinally, that declaration was trustworthy); see also Mueller and Kirkpatrick,\r\nModern Evidence Â§ 8.64 at p. 1393 (1995) (suggesting corroboration\r\nrequirement may be partly satisfied by additional proof statement was made\r\nbut that doubts on this score can undercut other corroborative circumstances).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, we find insufficient corroboration under the cases of this Court.\r\nIn State v. Forney, supra, the unavailable declarant allegedly admitted to a\r\ntotal of five witness that he had been the triggerman in murdering the victim.\r\nWe found no independent evidence corroborating the declarant's claim, and\r\nfound the declarant's credibility questionable, given that he had told a sixth\r\nperson he had not killed the victim. Accordingly, in Forney, we held the trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding the statement. Here, the only\r\nperson to whom Milligan made the allegedly inculpatory statement was\r\nRobinson, after the two had been smoking crack cocaine. Further, although\r\nMolen's testimony is some independent evidence of corroboration, his testimony\r\nwas contradicted by police officers who testified, contrary to Molen, that Kinloch\r\nadmitted he was wearing white pants on the night of the murder. As neither\r\nthe making of the statement nor its truth were clearly corroborated, we find no\r\nabuse of discretion in exclusion of Robinson's testimony. Forney, supra.\r\nFinally, in State v. Doctor, supra, we reversed the trial court's exclusion\r\nof the hearsay statements of two nontestifying minors who had confessed,\r\nseparately and in the presence of family members, to the crime. The non-testifying minors' testimony was directly corroborated by the testimony of a\r\nthird testifying minor who admitted committing the crime with the two minors.\r\nFurther, three independent witnesses testified they had seen all three of the\r\nminors in the stolen car with the stolen stereo on the day of the crime, and they\r\nhad not seen the defendant Doctor in the car that day. Accordingly, we found\r\nsufficient corroboration both of the statements themselves, (i.e., that they had\r\nbeen made and not fabricated), and of the contents of the statements. Unlike\r\nthe present case, the hearsay declarations in Doctor easily meet the standard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof clear corroboration.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in exclusion of Milligan's alleged\r\ndeclaration against penal interest. The judgment below is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Molen and Kinloch shared a residence with other family members.\r\n2 Police officers testified that Kinloch admitted to them that he was, in fact, wearing a pair of white pants while he was with the victim.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n3 He also proffered the testimony of Shirley Smith. However, he does not appeal the trial court's exclusion of Smith's testimony.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n4 Courts appear divided as to any precise test for determining whether a declaration has been sufficiently corroborated. Compare United States v. Salvador, 820 F.2d 558, 561-562 (2d Cir. 1987) (corroboration of both the declarant's trustworthiness and of the statement's trustworthiness was required), with United States v. Brainard, 690 F.2d 1117, 1124 (4th Cir. 1982)(rule requires not a determination that the declarant is credible, but a finding that the circumstances clearly indicate that the statement was not fabricated). See also United States v. Harty, 930 F.2d 1257, 1264-65 (7th Cir. 1991) (adopting two-part test that it must first be clear declarant actually made statement in question, and then there must be circumstantial evidence supporting the truth of the statement). Notably, the Harty court modified this test, citing the United State's Supreme Court's opinion in Dutton v. Evans 400 U.S. 74 (1970), finding the second prong to require the hearsay testimony must possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other evidence at trial. \r\n5 As pointed out in footnote 4, and as our holdings in Forney and Doctorindicate, the test for when a statement has been sufficiently corroborated is not precise. We decline, however, to adopt a specific test for determining whether a statement has been clearly corroborated. We find the matter is best left to the trial court's discretion after considering the totality of the circumstances under which a declaration against penal interest was made.  \r\n6Although we need not rest our decision on this basis, we are also concerned with Kinloch's failure to demonstrate Milligan's \"unavailability.\" To be admissible under Rule 804(b)(3), a witness must be \"unavailable\" as defined by Rule 804(a). The burden of showing unavailability is upon the party offering the witness. See M. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure-Evidence, Vol. 31, &sect; 6792 at p. 554 (1997). Moreover, according to McCormick on Evidence, mere absence of the declarant from the hearing, standing alone, does not establish unavailability. The proponent of the statement must also show he is unable to procure the declarant's attendance by process or other reasonable means. String, McCormick on Evidence, &sect; 253, p. 134. (4th Ed. 1992). Although a lesser showing may be adequate as to defense witnesses in criminal cases than is necessary for the government's showing, some effort at locating the witness is necessary. Id at Nt. 28, p. 135. Accord State v. Blankenship, 480 S.E.2d 178, 184 (W. Va. 1996)(where nothing in record demonstrated defendant had used substantial diligence to obtain presence ofwitness, he had failed to demonstrate unavailability and court properly refused to permit introduction of declarant's hearsay testimony). See also State v. Brown, 573 P.2d 675 (N.M. 1977).\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHere, there is simply no evidence Kinloch ever attempted to locate Milligan. Although Kinloch's cousin, Molen, testified he had not seen Milligan\r\nsince 1994, Kinloch offered no reason for her unavailability, nor is there any\r\nindication in the record that he made any attempts to locate her or subpoena\r\nher for trial. Notwithstanding the state's concession at oral argument before\r\nthis Court that it was unable to locate Milligan prior to trial, the mere fact that\r\nthe government and defense are unaware of a declarant's whereabouts does not\r\nestablish \"unavailability.\" See United States v. Draiman, 784 F.2d 248, 258 (7th Cir. 1986). See also 29 Am. Jur.2d Evidence &sect; 692 (1994)). The mere fact that the state was unable to locate a witness does not relieve the party offering the testimony of the burden of demonstrating unavailability. At best, in our opinion, the issue of Milligan's unavailability is a matter for exploration on post conviction relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25045","title":"Abbott v.

We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nRonnie Abbott was employed by a common carrier, Observer\r\nTransport, Inc. (Carrier). Carrier had a contract with Limited Distribution\r\nServices, Inc. (Distributor), Retailer's agent, to deliver goods to Retailer\r\nincluding \"inside delivery.\" Abbott was injured when he slipped and fell\r\nwhile unloading boxes on Retailer's premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbott received workers' compensation benefits from Carrier. The\r\nAbbotts then commenced this negligence action against Retailer. The trial\r\njudge granted Retailer's motion to dismiss finding Abbott was a statutory\r\nemployee of Retailer and therefore Abbott's exclusive remedy was under the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Act. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nAbbott v. The Limited, Inc., 332 S.C. 171, 503 S.E.2d 494 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals found Abbott was Retailer's statutory employee\r\nunder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (1985) which provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Â§ 42-1-400. Liability of owner to workmen of subcontractor. \r\n  When any person, in this section . . . referred to as \"owner,\" undertakes to perform or execute any work which is part of his\r\n    trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other\r\n    person (in this section . . . referred to as \"subcontractor\") for the\r\n    execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the\r\n    whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the\r\nowner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the\r\nwork any compensation under this Title which he would have\r\nbeen liable to pay if the workman had been immediately\r\nemployed by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining whether an employee is engaged in an activity that is\r\npart of the owner's trade, business, or occupation as required under Â§ 42-1\r\n400, this Court has applied three tests: (1) is the activity an important part\r\nof the owner's business or trade; (2) is the activity a necessary, essential, and\r\nintegral part of the owner's business; or (3) has the activity previously been\r\nperformed by the owner's employees?

Only one of these three tests need be met but\r\nthere is no easily applied formula and each case must be decided on its own\r\nfacts. Id. \"[T]he guidepost is whether or not that which is being done is or is\r\nnot a part of the general trade, business or occupation of the owner.\"\r\nHopkins v. Darlington Veneer Co., 208 S.C. 307, 311, 38 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1946).\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded Abbott was Retailer's statutory\r\n  employee because \"the prompt and efficient delivery of goods for the purpose\r\n  of stocking its retail stores is an integral and essential part of [Retailer's]\r\n  business\" and \"Abbott's work was at least important to [Retailer's] business.\"\r\n  The Abbotts contend this was error because the delivery of goods was not\r\n  integral to, or an important part of, Retailer's business. We agree.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe fact that it was important to Retailer to receive goods does not\r\nrender the delivery of goods an important part of Retailer's business. \"The\r\nmere fact that transportation of goods to one's place of business is essential\r\nfor the conduct of the business does not mean that the transportation of the\r\ngoods is a part or process of the business.\" Caton v. Winslow Bros. &amp; Smith\r\nCo., 309 Mass. 150, 154, 34 N.E.2d 638, 641 (1941).

Services, Inc.\r\nor Hardee's (\"Hardee's\") in Ridgeland, South Carolina. At the time of her\r\ninjury, Hardee's was insured by Northwestern with a policy that covered up to\r\n$5,000 in medical expenses per person for injury caused by accident, regardless\r\nof fault. The policy required that expenses be incurred and reported within one\r\nyear of the accident date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the expiration of a year, Kleckley incurred and reported medical\r\nexpenses to Northwestern's adjuster and inquired about the existence of\r\nmedical pay coverage. Despite numerous requests in 1993 and 1994,\r\nNorthwestern did not inform Kleckley until December, 1995 that medical\r\npayments were available under the insurance policy. Once Kleckley discovered\r\nthe existence of the medical pay coverage, she demanded payment of her\r\nmedical bills. On March 19, 1996, Northwestern denied medical payments to\r\nKleckley on the basis the insurance policy required bills be incurred and\r\nreported within one year of the date of the incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley brought an action against Northwestern for: (1) payment of\r\nmedical expenses; (2) violation of South Carolina Claims Practices Act, S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§Â§ 38-59-10 to -50 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1998); and (3) bad faith refusal to\r\npay benefits Kleckley alleged she was due under the insurance policy. The\r\ncircuit court dismissed Kleckley's second and third causes of action, holding\r\nKleckley did not have a right to assert a claim for bad faith against\r\nNorthwestern because she was not a party to the insurance policy. Kleckley\r\nappealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that Kleckley did not have\r\nstanding to bring a bad faith action because she was a third party to the\r\ninsurance policy. Kleckley appeals, raising the following issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the dismissal of\r\n    Kleckley's third party claim for bad faith refusal to pay\r\n    benefits on the basis she lacked standing to sue?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  (2) Does Kleckley have standing to sue Northwestern for negligence?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. BAD FAITH REFUSAL TO PAY BENEFITS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding she did not have\r\nstanding to pursue a bad faith cause of action against Northwestern because\r\nshe is an \"injured person\" within the meaning of the insurance policy. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA tort action for an insurer's bad faith refusal to pay benefits does not\r\nextend to third parties who are not named insureds. As a means of protecting\r\ninsureds who ordinarily possess no bargaining power when entering into an\r\ninsurance contract, in Nichols v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 279 S.C. 336,\r\n306 S.E.2d 616 (1983) we recognized a tort action for an insurer's bad faith\r\nrefusal to pay first-party benefits. Nichols allowed a first-party claim by the\r\ninsured for bad faith in processing claims for benefits due under a \"mutually\r\nbinding contract of insurance.\" Id. at 340, 306 S.E.2d at 619. This Court and\r\nthe Court of Appeals have repeatedly denied actions for bad faith refusal to pay\r\nclaims to third parties who are not named insureds. See, e.g., Carter v.\r\nAmerican Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 279 S.C. 368, 307 S.E.2d 227 (1983); Cook v.\r\nMack's Transfer &amp; Storage, 291 S.C. 84, 352 S.E.2d 296 (Ct. App. 1986);\r\nSwinton v. Chubb &amp; Son, Inc., 283 S.C. 11, 320 S.E.2d 495 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nTherefore, denying Kleckley's claim is in line with established South Carolina\r\nprecedent because she is a third party to the insurance contract between\r\nHardee's and Northwestern, and not a named insured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have recognized a limited exception to the rule that third parties can\r\nnot recover for bad faith refusal to pay first-party benefits. In Ateyeh v.\r\nVolkswagen  of Florence, Inc., 288 S.C. 101, 341 S.E.2d 378 (1986), a widow\r\nbrought a bad faith refusal to pay benefits action against her spouse's employer\r\nand health insurance carrier. We allowed the widow to recover, holding: \"By\r\nvirtue of the necessaries doctrine, Ateyeh stands in a derivative policyholder\r\nposition, and her interest in enforcement of the policy is not merely contingent.\"\r\nId. at 103, 341 S.E.2d at 380. Ateyeh, supra, is factually distinguishable from\r\nthe case at hand because due to the necessaries doctrine, a derivative\r\nrelationship existed between the widow and her deceased spouse which\r\nobligated her to pay the bills of her husband and therefore allowed her to\r\nassume the position of an insured under the policy. See Kleckley v.\r\nNorthwestern Nat. Cas. Co., 330 S.C. 277, 498 S.E.2d 669 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley argues that the Court of Appeals's holding in Cook v. Mack's\r\nTransfer &amp; Storage, 291 S.C. 84, 352 S.E.2d 296 (Ct. App. 1986) allows her to\r\nbring a third party bad faith refusal to pay benefits claims. In Cook, an injured\r\nemployee brought suit against his employer and the employer's workers'\r\ncompensation carrier for bad faith refusal to pay benefits for his workers'\r\ncompensation claim. However, the Court of Appeals clearly stated in Cook:\r\n\"Cook also fails to come within the scope of Nichols because he is a third party\r\nto the insurance contract in question . . . . Nichols provides an additional remedy\r\nto the insured, not to third parties. In those cases where our courts have\r\nsustained the bad faith cause of action, the plaintiff was the insured himself.\"\r\nId. at 90, 325 S.E.2d at 300.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley finally argues that she was improperly characterized as a \"third\r\nparty\" by the Court of Appeals. Kleckley claims she is an \"injured party\" under\r\nthe express terms of the insurance contract between Hardee's and\r\nNorthwestern. She attempts to distinguish the cases relied upon by the Court\r\nof Appeals by arguing she is not a true \"third party\" because her substantive\r\nrights arise directly from Northwestern's bad faith and negligent refusal to\r\nabide by the insurance policy's terms. This argument is without merit because\r\nSouth Carolina has never extended the concept of an \"insured\" to include\r\nparties whose rights arise from the contract between the first party insured and\r\nthe insurer. In South Carolina, our courts have repeatedly held that you must\r\nbe the named insured to recover for bad faith refusal to pay benefits. But see\r\nAteyeh, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley's attorneys could have pursued other lawful remedies against\r\nNorthwestern in this matter. The record does not indicate whether Kleckley\r\nsettled with Hardee's before pursuing a bad faith action against Northwestern.\r\nUpon being denied insurance benefits by Northwestern, Kleckley could have\r\nsued Hardee's who could then lawfully pursue a bad faith refusal to pay first\r\nparty benefits claim against Northwestern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley could have also argued that Northwestern should be estopped\r\nfrom asserting the statute of limitations defense. \"Under South Carolina law,\r\na defendant may be estopped from claiming the statute of limitations as a\r\ndefense if the delay that otherwise would give operation to the statute had been\r\ninduced by the defendant's conduct.\" Black v. Lexington Sch. Dist. No. 2, 327\r\nS.C. 55, 488 S.E.2d 327 (1997) (citations omitted); see also Holy Lock Distrabs.,\r\nInc. v. Hitchcock, 332 S.C. 247, 503 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1998). Such\r\ninducement may consist of an express representation that the claim will be settled without litigation or conduct that suggests a lawsuit is not necessary.\r\nBlack, 327 S.C. at 61, 488 S.E.2d at 330. The defendant's conduct may also\r\ninvolve inducing the plaintiff either to believe that an amicable adjustment of\r\nthe claim will be made without suit or to forbear exercising the. right to sue.\r\nRepublic Contracting Corp. v. South Carolina Dept. of Highways and Pub.\r\nTransp., 332 S.C. 197, 503 S.E.2d 761 (Ct. App. 1998). In the instant case,\r\nNorthwestern is estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense\r\nbecause their lack of communication with Kleckley was the sole reason she\r\nallowed the statute of limitations to elapse. Kleckley inquired about the\r\ninsurance coverage within the one year statute of limitations. Because\r\nNorthwestern did not inform her of the appropriate procedure within the year\r\ntime frame, Kleckley did not exercise her right to sue. Therefore, because\r\nNorthwestern's action induced Kleckley to forbear exercising her right to\r\nrecover her medical expenses, they are equitably estopped from asserting\r\nstatute of limitations as a defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the South Carolina Claims Practices Act, S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§Â§ 38-59-10 to -50 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1998) provides an adequate remedy for third\r\nparties who have been wronged by improper claims practices. Specifically,\r\nsection 38-59-20 permits an administrative action before the Chief Insurance\r\nCommissioner by third parties for improper claims practices where the insurer:\r\n(1) knowingly misrepresents facts or policy provisions relating to coverage or\r\nprovides deceptive or misleading information with respect to coverage; (2) fails\r\nto acknowledge with reasonable promptness pertinent communications with\r\nrespect to claims arising under its policies; (3) fails to adopt and implement\r\nreasonable standards for the prompt investigation of claims; and (4) not\r\nattempting in good faith to effect prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of\r\nclaims. Therefore, the Legislature has specifically provided a remedy for\r\nKleckley to assert as a third party against Northwestern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. NEGLIGENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley contends she has standing to pursue a negligence cause of action\r\nagainst Northwestern. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley's negligence action is not properly before this Court. An issue\r\nnot raised to or addressed by the trial court or the Court of Appeals is not\r\nproperly preserved for review by the Supreme Court on certiorari. See\r\nAnonymous v. State Bd. of Medical Examiners, 329 S.C. 371, 496 S.E.2d 17\r\n(1998); Camp v. Springs Mfg. Corp., 310 S.C. 514, 426 S.E.2d 304 (1993) (issue\r\nnot preserved for appeal where the Court of Appeals did not address the issue\r\nand petitioner did not petition for rehearing for the court to consider it). \"Only\r\nthose questions raised in the Court of Appeals and in the petition for rehearing\r\nshall be included in the petition for writ of certiorari as a question presented to\r\nthe Supreme Court.\" Rule 226(d)(2), SCACR (emphasis added). The negligence\r\nissue was raised for the first time in Kleckley's Petition for Rehearing and was\r\nnot addressed by either the trial court or the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley claims her negligence action was properly preserved for appeal\r\nbecause it was encompassed in her third cause of action for bad faith.\r\nKleckley's third cause of action is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Defendant's actions were in bad faith and/or have been an\r\n    intentional reckless and unreasonable refusal to pay benefits\r\n    clearly due under the policy thereby entitling plaintiff to actual\r\n    damages, punitive damages, reasonable attorney's fees and the\r\n    costs of this action.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving failed to claim that her third cause of action includes negligence before\r\neither the trial court or Court of Appeals, Kleckley cannot do so for the first\r\ntime in her Petition for Rehearing. Furthermore, Kleckley's third cause of\r\naction for bad faith does not include a negligence action. To state a cause of\r\naction for negligence the plaintiff must allege facts which demonstrate the\r\nconcurrence of three elements: (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant; (2) a\r\nbreach of that duty by negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately\r\ncaused by the breach. See Bullard v. Ehrhardt, 283 S.C. 557, 324 S.E.2d 61\r\n(1984); South Carolina State Ports Auth. v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., 289\r\nS.C. 373, 346 S.E.2d 324 (1986). In her Complaint, Kleckley does not plead\r\nnegligence, duty, due care, breach, proximate cause, or any other element\r\nassociated with negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKleckley asserts that this Court's holding in Barker v. Souls, 289 S.C.\r\n121, 345 S.E.2d 244 (1986) allows her to bring a negligence action. In Barker,\r\nthis Court held that an employee could sue an insurance agent for negligence\r\nand fraud where the employee's worker's compensation claim was denied\r\nbecause no workers' compensation policy existed between the employer and the\r\ninsurance company. This Court permitted the negligence action, stating: \"A\r\ntortfeasor may be subjected to tort liability for injury to a third party arising out\r\nof the tortfeasor's contractual relationship with another, despite the absence of\r\nprivity between the tortfeasor and the third party.\" Id. at 122, 345 S.E.2d at\r\n244. Kleckley's reliance on Barker is misplaced because it is factually\r\ndistinguishable from the instant case because: (1) Barker involves an action for\r\nfraud and negligence, not bad faith refusal to pay benefits; and (2) the action\r\nwas pursued against the employer's insurance agent, not the insurer. See\r\nKleckley v. Northwestern Nat. Cas. Co., 330 S.C. 277, 498 S.E.2d. 669 (Ct. App.\r\n1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER,, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25047","title":"State v.

We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 1994, at around 10:30 p.m., Jackie Lee King and her live-in\r\nboyfriend, Roger Dale Johnson, walked from their house to Char's, a nearby\r\nrestaurant in Greenville County. Johnson and King arrived at Char's at around\r\n10:45 p.m. They sat down at a table and ordered beers. The only Char's\r\nemployee working at the time was Kimberly Sue Edwards, the bartender. A few\r\nmoments later, two customers left Char's, leaving Edwards, Johnson, and King\r\nalone in the restaurant. It was near closing time, and Edwards began washing\r\nglasses and totaling up the receipts. Johnson got up and walked to the counter\r\nacross from where Edwards was standing. Edwards was on the telephone and\r\nhad her back to Johnson. After Edwards hung up the phone, Johnson jumped\r\nover the counter, grabbed Edwards and held a knife to her throat. Johnson and\r\nKing proceeded to steal the money from the bar. King wiped off the counter, the\r\ntable and the juke box to remove any fingerprints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson and King forced Edwards outside. Edwards tried to escape but\r\nwas quickly recaptured by Johnson. All three then got into Edwards's black\r\nBlazer. King drove them to King's house. They arrived at the house at around\r\n1:00 am. Johnson carried Edwards into the house and placed her in a chair in\r\nthe living room. King tied Edwards's feet with an electrical cord. After changing\r\nclothes, Johnson carried Edwards back to the car. King's teenage son was in the\r\nhouse during this time. The son testified that he helped his mother find the\r\nelectrical cord. He also stated that a machete he owned disappeared around the\r\ntime King and Johnson left the house with Edwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKing resumed driving Edwards's car. Johnson was in the passenger seat,\r\nand Edwards was tied up in the backseat. King got on Interstate-26 headed\r\ntoward Columbia. Soon thereafter, King exited the highway and proceeded\r\ndown a dead-end road. She stopped in a secluded area where all three got out\r\nof the car. King testified she heard Edwards say, \"I see what you've got in your\r\nhand. No you promised.\" King then said she saw a machete come up and go\r\ndown, and she heard \"bones crunch twice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKing and Johnson got back into Edwards's car. King testified Johnson had\r\nthe machete, and it was covered in blood. Johnson also had taken Edwards's\r\npurse and jewelry. King and Johnson drove, to another dead-end road where\r\nJohnson burned his shirt and Edwards's purse. At around 8:00 a.m., Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand King picked up a friend who led them to an area near the Saluda River\r\nwhere Johnson set Edwards's car on fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson and King were arrested for Edwards's murder. King entered into\r\na plea agreement with the State by which she agreed to testify against Johnson\r\nin exchange for a fifteen year cap on her sentence. Johnson went to trial on\r\nFebruary 19, 1996. Johnson was found guilty of murder and kidnaping. The\r\njury sentenced him to death. Johnson appeals, raising the following issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. During the guilt phase, did the trial court err when it admitted into\r\n    evidence an enlarged version of a photograph of Edwards's two children?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  2. During the guilt phase, did the trial court err when it refused to permit\r\n    Johnson to contradict the testimony of Jerry Ward?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  3. During the sentencing phase, did the trial court err when it refused to\r\n    permit Johnson's sister to ask for mercy on Johnson's behalf?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  4. During the sentencing phase, did the trial court err when it submitted\r\n    the aggravating circumstance of physical torture to the jury?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  5. During the sentencing phase, did the trial court err in admitting\r\n    gruesome, color photographs of the victim, thereby violating the Eighth and\r\n    Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. GUILT PHASE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Photograph of Victim's Children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson argues that it was error for the trial court to admit into evidence\r\nan enlarged version of a photograph of Edwards's two sons. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the burned remains of Edwards's purse, police found a photograph\r\nof Edwards's two sons. The photograph depicted the children sitting on Santa's\r\nlap. The photograph was damaged, but discernible. At trial, the prosecutor\r\noffered into evidence a crime scene photograph showing Edwards's photograph\r\namidst the charred remains of the purse. The prosecution's photograph\r\nmeasured 8\" x 12\"; Edwards's photograph occupied 2\" x 4\" of the prosecution's\r\nphotograph. The prosecution intended to use its photograph to establish that\r\nthe purse belonged to Edwards. Johnson's attorney objected, arguing the\r\nenlarged version was prejudicial to Johnson and unnecessary since the original\r\nphotograph was available to the jury. The trial judge ruled that the original\r\nphotograph was too fragile for the jury to handle, and the prosecution's\r\nphotograph would better assist the jury in examining the item. The defense\r\noffered to stipulate that the purse belonged to Edwards, but the prosecutor\r\nrejected the offer. The trial judge admitted the photograph into evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the State has the right to prove every element of the crime\r\ncharged and is not obligated to rely upon a defendant's stipulation. 73 Am. Jur.\r\n2d Stipulations Â§ 17, at 557 (1974). The relevancy, materiality, and\r\nadmissibility of photographs as evidence are matters left to the sound discretion\r\nof the trial court. State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 350 S.E.2d 180 (1986), cert.\r\ndenied, 480 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 1592, 94 L. Ed. 2d 781 (1987). However,\r\nphotographs calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should\r\nbe excluded if they are irrelevant or unnecessary to the issues at trial. State v.\r\nMiddleton, 288 S.C. 21, 339 S.E.2d 692 (1986), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 872.,109 S.\r\nCt.. 189, 102 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1988). Yet, there is no abuse of discretion if the\r\noffered photograph serves to corroborate testimony. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe photograph of the children was clearly relevant in proving that the\r\npurse belonged to Edwards. In turn, establishing Edwards as the owner of the\r\npurse served to corroborate King's version of events. Johnson's only objection at\r\ntrial concerned the enlarged size of the prosecution's reproduction. However,\r\nEdwards's photograph only covered 2\" x 4\" of the prosecution's 8\" x 12\"\r\nphotograph. Moreover, the trial court determined that the original photograph\r\nwas too fragile for the jury to handle and, as a result, admitted the prosecution's\r\nphotograph into evidence. Johnson nevertheless argues the admission of the\r\nphotograph was unnecessary because there were other items among the remains\r\nbearing the name of Edwards's husband. However, it is generally recognized\r\nthat the prosecution and the defense should be afforded wide discretion in the\r\nselection and presentation of evidence. See State v. Richardson, 253 S.C. 468,\r\n474, 171 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1969)(\"The prosecution is required to prove the guilt\r\nof the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt and may, in its discretion, determine\r\nwhat witnesses will be called in presenting such proof.\"), cert. denied, 396 U.S.\r\n955, 90 S. Ct. 427, 24 L. Ed. 2d 421(1969); see also Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S.\r\n409, 426, 96 S. Ct. 984, 993, 47 L. Ed. 2d 128 (1976)(\"Attaining the system's goal\r\nof accurately determining guilt or innocence requires that both the prosecution\r\nand the defense have wide discretion in the conduct of the trial and the\r\npresentation of evidence.\"); People v. District Court In &amp; For Denver, 767 P.2d\r\n239 (Col. 1989). We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion by admitting the prosecution's photograph into evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Testimony of Jerry Ward\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson argues that the trial court erred when it refused to permit\r\nJohnson to contradict the testimony of Jerry Ward. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWard was in a jail cell next to Johnson for approximately six months.\r\nDuring this period, Ward and Johnson frequently spoke to one another about\r\ntheir cases and passed notes back and forth. Ward was called by the prosecution\r\nto testify at Johnson's trial. During cross-examination, the following colloquy\r\noccurred between Johnson's attorney and Ward:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Q. Now, would you consider yourself easygoing, laid back,\r\n    levelheaded?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  A. Would I? I would love to consider myself that way.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Q. And really don't get frustrated or excited or overly emotional, is\r\n    that correct?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  A. I can't say overly emotional. I get frustrated, overly excited and\r\n    emotional, sir.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Q. Okay. But for the most part, you are a pretty even keel type\r\n    person?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  A. I would hate to flatter myself and say yes and you come up with\r\n    something derogatory --\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Q. No. You go right ahead and flatter yourself, Mr. Ward. That's\r\n    fine.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  A. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to -- I'm going to say that\r\n    I'm -- I'm far from being an angel, sir, but I'm not even in the\r\n    running for the devil.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Q. Mr. Ward, I didn't ask you whether you were an angel. Are you\r\n    -- do you consider yourself rational?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  A. For the most part, yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n  Q. Okay.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  A. Not entirely.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point, defense counsel attempted to cross-examine Ward with a\r\nletter Ward had written to another inmate while in jail. In the letter, among\r\nother derogatory remarks, Ward advises the inmate, \"I could in fact be in error\r\nof my opinion of you being an ass___ . You could in fact qualify to be considered\r\na -- what I have been heard referred to as a complete ass___, and I am known\r\nfor my proficiency in giving credit where there is credit due.\" The prosecutor\r\nmade a relevancy objection which the trial court sustained on the ground that\r\nthe letter would tend to confuse the jury.\r\nJohnson argues the letter was relevant to contradicting Ward's\r\n  characterization of himself as a rational, calm person. We disagree. \"'Relevant\r\n  evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, SORE. \"A witness\r\n  may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to any issue in the case,\r\n  including credibility.\" Rule 611(b), SORE. Considerable latitude is allowed in\r\n  cross-examination to test a witness's credibility. Martin v. Dunlap, 266 S. C. 230,\r\n  222 S.E.2d 8 (1976). However, a trial judge may impose reasonable limits on\r\n  cross-examination based upon concerns about, among other things, harassment,\r\n  prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness safety, or interrogation that is\r\n  repetitive or only marginally relevant. State v. Jenkins, 322 S.C. 360, 474 S.E.2d\r\n  812 (Ct. App. 1996). An appellate court will not disturb a trial court's ruling\r\n  concerning the scope of cross-examination of a witness to test his or her\r\n  credibility, or to show possible bias or self-interest in testifying, absent a\r\n  manifest abuse of discretion. State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411\r\n  (1994).\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nHere, Ward did not characterize himself as a totally rational or calm\r\nperson. He admitted he was \"far from being an angel,\" and he could get\r\n\"frustrated, overly excited and emotional.\" Moreover, the jury was aware of\r\nWard's lengthy criminal record, which included escape from prison. Thus, the\r\nletter was not relevant to any issue at trial, including Ward's credibility. It\r\nmerely demonstrated that Ward was capable of hurling expletives at other\r\ninmates. It was, in fact, consistent with his characterization of himself. We\r\nconclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to exclude the\r\nletter on the ground that it would tend to confuse the jury.\r\np.42\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. SENTENCING PHASE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Testimony of Johnson's Sister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson argues that the trial court erred when it refused to permit his\r\nsister from asking for mercy on his behalf. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the sentencing phase, Johnson's sister was called to testify on his\r\nbehalf. Shortly into her testimony, she became emotional, and the trial judge\r\nwas forced to remove the jury from the courtroom so she could compose herself.\r\nWhile the jury was out, Johnson's attorney informed the court that he intended\r\nto ask Johnson's sister whether she wanted Johnson to die. The prosecutor\r\nobjected. The trial court ruled that the defense could not ask the question\r\npursuant to State v. Matthews, 296 S.C. 379, 373 S.E.2d 587 (1988), cert. denied,\r\n489 U.S. 1091, 109 S. Ct. 1559, 103 L. Ed. 2d 861 (1989). After the jury\r\nreturned, Johnson's sister testified about the abusive family environment she\r\nand her brother endured while growing up. She also opined that Jackie King\r\nwas manipulative and a negative influence on her brother. Johnson's sister was\r\nfinally asked whether she loved her brother. She responded, \"Yes, sir. With all\r\nof my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Matthews, the defendant argued that the trial court erred when\r\nit prohibited defense counsel from asking members of defendant's family which\r\nsentence they thought defendant should receive. We held that there was no\r\nerror because \"[t]he line of questioning prohibited . . . went to the ultimate issue\r\nto be decided by the jury -- life imprisonment versus death penalty -- and was\r\nproperly reserved for jury determination.\" State v. Matthews, 296 S.C. at 393,\r\n373 S.E.2d at 595.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe later distinguished Matthews in State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406\r\nS.E.2d 315 (1991). In Torrence, we adopted the Georgia Supreme Court's\r\ndistinction between a plea for mercy and the ultimate question to be decided by\r\nthe jury:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [A]lthough a defendant may present witnesses who know and care\r\n    for him and are willing on that basis to ask for mercy on his behalf,\r\n    a defendant may not present witnesses to testify merely to their\r\n    religious and philosophical attitudes about the death penalty . . . .\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nNor is a defendant entitled to present the opinion of a witness about\r\n    what verdict the jury \"ought\" to reach. \r\n\r\nTorrence, 305 S.C. at 51, 406 S.E.2d at 318 (quoting Childs v. State, 357 S.E.2d\r\n48, 60 (Ga. 1987)). In Torrence, defense counsel attempted to ask the\r\ndefendant's mother the following question at sentencing: \"Do you have a basis\r\nfor asking this jury to spare your son's life?\" The prosecutor objected, arguing\r\nthe question went to the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury. The trial court\r\nsustained the objection. We disagreed and found the question was proper\r\nbecause it sought only to have the witness make a general plea for mercy for the\r\nlife of her son. We distinguished Matthews by stating, \"[Torrence] did not seek\r\nto elicit testimony about what verdict the witness thought should be imposed,\r\nas was the case in State v. Matthews.\" Id. at 51, 406 S.E.2d at 319.\r\nNevertheless, we found that the defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's\r\nruling because the witness was able to make a general plea for mercy on the\r\ndefendant's behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the defense did not seek to elicit the opinion of Johnson's sister\r\nabout what verdict the jury \"ought\" to reach. Defense counsel merely proposed\r\nto ask her whether she wanted Johnson to die. Like Torrence, the prohibited\r\nquestion did not address the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury. However,\r\ndespite the trial court's ruling which limited her testimony, Johnson's sister was\r\nable to make a general plea for mercy on her brother's behalf. In addition to her\r\ntestimony concerning their abusive family life, she clearly expressed her love\r\nand affection for Johnson at trial. Therefore, we conclude Johnson has failed to\r\ndemonstrate that he was prejudiced by the trial court's ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Physical Torture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson argues the trial court erred when it submitted the aggravating\r\ncircumstance of physical torture to the jury. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining whether to submit an aggravating circumstance to the\r\njury, the trial court is concerned only with the existence of evidence, not its\r\nweight. State v. Smith, 298 S.C. 482, 381 S.E.2d 724 (1989), cert. denied, 494\r\nU.S. 1060, 110 S. Ct. 1536, 108 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1990). The aggravating\r\ncircumstance is properly submitted if supported by any direct or circumstantial\r\nevidence. State v. Butler, 277 S.C. 452, 290 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 932,\r\n103 S. Ct. 242, 74 L. Ed. 2d 191(1982).\r\nAt trial, the State's expert pathologist testified Edwards died as a result\r\n  of blood loss, and it took approximately ten minutes for her to die. The\r\n  pathologist conceded he could not determine the order in which the blows were\r\n  struck, and any one of the blows to the head may have rendered Edwards\r\n  unconscious. The pathologist further testified the blows would have been painful\r\n  if Edwards were in fact conscious. Johnson argues the evidence does not\r\n  demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that Edwards consciously experienced\r\n  pain during the attack. Consequently, the aggravating circumstance of physical\r\n  torture should not have been submitted to the jury.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nIn State v. Elmore, 279 S.C. 417, 308 S.E.2d 781(1983), overruled on other\r\ngrounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991), we adopted the\r\nGeorgia Supreme Court's definition of torture. See Hance v. State, 268 S.E.2d\r\n339, 345 (Ga. 1980). Under this definition, torture occurs (1) when the victim is\r\nsubjected to serious physical abuse before death; or (2) when the victim is\r\nsubjected to an aggravated battery before death. Elmore, 279 S.C. at 422, 308\r\nS.E.2d at 785. Johnson contends that conscious awareness of pain is a necessary\r\ncomponent of physical torture. We disagree. Physical torture is not predicated\r\nupon the amount of pain suffered by a murder victim. Although conscious\r\nawareness of pain may buttress the conclusion that the victim was subjected to\r\nserious physical abuse before death, its absence does not foreclose a finding of\r\nphysical torture; the abusive and depraved nature of the homicidal assault is not\r\nerased solely because the victim mercifully may have been rendered unconscious\r\nat the outset of the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, Edwards suffered massive blows from a machete before finally\r\nbleeding to death. In addition to the pathologist's testimony, a SLED agent\r\ntestified that the blood stain patterns indicated Edwards had fallen in one spot\r\nand then rolled to her final resting place several feet away. The agent opined,\r\nthat Edwards had rolled on her own after the initial blow. Moreover,\r\nphotographs presented by the prosecution indicated Edwards had suffered a\r\ndefensive-type laceration on her left index finger. Therefore, we conclude that\r\nthe evidence warranted the submission to the jury of the aggravating\r\ncircumstance of physical torture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Photographs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson argues that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence\r\ngruesome, color photographs of the victim, thereby violating the Eighth and\r\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sentencing proceedings, the .trial court may admit photographs which\r\ndepict the bodies of the murder victims in substantially the same condition in\r\nwhich the defendant left them in order to show the circumstances of the crime\r\nand the character of the defendant. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 350 S.E.2d 180.\r\nThey are also admissible when material and relevant to an aggravating\r\ncircumstance. State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357, cert. denied, ___\r\nU.S.___ , 116 S. Ct. 160, 133 L. Ed. 2d 103 (1995). However, photographs that\r\nare unfairly prejudicial so as to outweigh their probative value are not\r\nadmissible. To constitute unfair prejudice, the photos must create a tendency\r\nto suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly though not necessarily, an\r\nemotional one. State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, Johnson challenges the admissibility of four crime scene\r\nphotographs and five autopsy photographs.1 The crime scene photographs were\r\nintroduced into evidence during the testimony of SLED agent Wade Fleming.\r\nFleming had taken the photographs shortly after arriving at the scene. The first\r\nphotograph showed Edwards's entire body as discovered by police at the crime\r\nscene. The second photograph was a close-up view of Edwards's left hand and\r\nforearm. It revealed a defensive-type laceration on her left index finger. The\r\nlast two photographs were close-up shots of Edwards's head and chest. One\r\nphotograph showed police pulling back Edwards's hair to reveal a head wound.\r\nThe other photograph showed Edwards's head undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese photographs were relevant for a number of reasons. First, Fleming\r\nused them to illustrate the blood stain patterns and debris found on Edwards's\r\nclothing. Based upon this evidence, Fleming testified Edwards had rolled more\r\nthan six feet after the initial blow. Next, the photographs of Edwards's head and\r\nhand showed the brutality of the crime and the nature of the physical abuse\r\nendured by Edwards prior to her death. This evidence was not only pertinent\r\nto showing the circumstances of the crime and the character of the defendant,\r\nbut it went directly to establishing the aggravating circumstance of physical\r\ntorture. We therefore find the prejudicial effect of the crime scene photographs\r\ndid not outweigh their probative value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe five autopsy photographs were introduced during the testimony of the\r\nState's expert pathologist. Three of the photographs were close-up pictures of\r\nEdwards's nearly severed shoulder. The remaining two pictures showed\r\nEdwards's head wounds. Although each of the hotographs were\r\nunderstandably difficult to look at, they nevertheless revealed the true nature\r\nof the attack and would have permitted the jury to comprehend the precise\r\ndamage inflicted by the machete. This, in turn, would have allowed the jury to\r\ndetermine the existence of physical torture by assessing the seriousness of the\r\nphysical abuse inflicted upon Edwards's body before her death. We therefore\r\nconclude the prejudicial effect of the autopsy photographs did not outweigh their\r\nprobative value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have conducted the proportionality review pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 16-3-25 (1985). We have reviewed the entire record and conclude the death\r\nsentence was not the result of passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factors, and\r\nthe evidence supports the jury's finding of the aggravating circumstances. The\r\ndeath sentence is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in\r\nsimilar cases. See State v. Bennett, Op. No. 24718 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Dec. 1,\r\n1997)(Davis Adv. Sh. No. 33); State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260\r\n(1996), cert. denied, U.S. , 117 S. Ct. 1561, 137 L. Ed. 2d 708 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court is AFFIRMED on all issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur. FINNEY, C.J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J.: I respectfully dissent. The admission of the enhanced\r\nphotograph depicting the victim's children served no legitimate evidentiary\r\npurpose, and acted only to arouse the jury's sympathy and prejudice, and\r\ntherefore should have been excluded. Compare State v. Rosemond, ___ S.C.\r\n___,  518 S.E.2d 588 (1999)(Finney, C.J., dissenting); State v. Livingston,, 327\r\nS.C. 17, 488 S.E.2d 313 (1997). Further, in my opinion, the trial judge\r\nabused his discretion in excluding the letter proffered by appellant to\r\nimpeach the witness. I simply do not understand, and the majority does not\r\nexplain, how the letter would have confused the jury. In my view, these two\r\nevidentiary errors in the guilt phase require a reversal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, I cannot agree that the trial court's erroneous limitation\r\non appellant's sister's plea for mercy was harmless error. Her statement, in\r\nresponse to a single question, that she loves appellant with all her heart is\r\nnot the equivalent of a general plea for mercy. Compare State v. Torrence,\r\n305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991)(harmless error where appellant's mother\r\npermitted to testify she did not want him to die, that she loved him, and that\r\nshe wanted him to get help).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, I would reverse and remand for a\r\nnew trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1We note that not all of the crime scene photographs designated by Johnson on appeal were initially transmitted to this Court from the trial court. The absent photographs were identified as State's Exhibits nos. 174, 175, and 176. Eventually, all of the pertinent exhibits were transferred to this Court for appellate review. The complete list of crime scene photographs challenged by Johnson on appeal includes State's Exhibits nos. 4, 174, 175, and 176. The autopsy photographs include State's Exhibits nos. 6 through 10. Johnson does not challenge State's Exhibit no. 5, an autopsy photograph of Edwards's left hand. We have examined all of these exhibits. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25048","title":"I'on v.

Pleasant. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: This case raises the novel issue of whether zoning\r\nby initiative and referendum is allowed in South Carolina. Respondent I'On, L.L.C. (Developer) brought a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of a proposed voter referendum on a zoning matter in the Town of Mt. Pleasant (Town). The circuit judge struck down the proposed referendum after a non-jury trial. James A. Renneker and Henry G. Thomas, IV (appellants), who participated in a citizens' effort to block the project, appeal. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1995, Developer asked the Mt. Pleasant Board of Planning and\r\nZoning (the Zoning Board) to rezone a 243-acre tract from R-1 to Planned\r\nDevelopment (PD). R-1 zones are restricted primarily to single-family houses, while PD zoning allows a mix of residential and commercial uses. Developer wanted to build a more traditional neighborhood containing a variety of development, including commercial locations: PD zoning of the tract was allowed under the land use master plan Town had approved several years earlier. The Zoning Board recommended approval of Developer's rezoning request but the Town Council, which makes the final decision on all zoning matters, denied it in a 5-4 vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Developer resubmitted its rezoning request after modifying\r\nportions of the project. The Zoning Board again recommended approving the\r\nrequest. Many Town residents spoke for and against the project at two council\r\nmeetings. The Town Council gave final approval to an ordinance granting PD\r\nzoning to the tract in a 6-3 vote March 11, 1997.\r\nCitizens opposed to the project immediately launched a petition drive to submit a proposed ordinance to the Town Council that would restore the zoning of the tract to R-1 or, if the Town Council rejected the proposed ordinance, to submit the matter to voters in a referendum. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-17-10 and -30 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1998) (establishing initiative and referendum process). Some 4,500 residents signed the petition. In July 1997, Charleston County voter registration officials certified that the petition contained more than the fifteen percent of the qualified Town electors required by Section 5-17-10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloper filed a lawsuit that included a declaratory judgment\r\naction and a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to prevent the\r\nTown Council from taking any action on the petition. A circuit judge issued a\r\ntemporary restraining order. After a hearing, another circuit judge lifted the\r\nTRO to allow the Town Council to take whatever action it deemed necessary on\r\nthe petition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August 1997, the Town Council voted 6-3 to reject the proposed\r\nordinance and instead approved a resolution placing a revised version of the\r\nordinance on the ballot in a special election set for November 1997. The\r\nreferendum question stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  SHOULD THE TOWN COUNCIL OF THE TOWN OF\r\n    MOUNT PLEASANT REPEAL ZONING ORDINANCE\r\n    NUMBER 97010 PASSED ON MARCH 11, 1997,\r\n    WHICH REZONED THE APPROXIMATELY 243\r\n    ACRES MORE OR LESS, BORDERED BY HOBCAW\r\n    CREEK AND MATHIS FERRY ROAD, KNOWN AS\r\n    THE JORDAN TRACT, AND TO BE KNOWN AS\r\n    I-ON, FROM R-1, SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL\r\n    TO PD, PLANNED DEVELOPMENT, AND AT THE\r\n    SAME TIME HAVE THE JORDAN TRACT REVERT\r\n    TO R-1 ZONING?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolution stated the italicized information was modified or added to the\r\nproposed ordinance contained in the petition in order to correct the ordinance\r\ndate and identify Developer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit judge subsequently held a non jury trial and struck\r\ndown the proposed referendum. The judge based his ruling on the sole ground\r\nthat zoning matters could be decided in Town only under the specific procedures\r\nset forth in Chapter 7 of Title 6, which Town has adopted in its zoning code, and\r\nnot by the general initiative and referendum process contained in Chapter 17\r\nof Title 5. The judge believed the initiative and referendum process was totally\r\nat odds with the detailed procedures set forth in Chapter 7 of Title 6; therefore,\r\nthe Legislature could not have intended to allow voters to decide complex\r\nmatters such as zoning in a referendum. The judge denied appellants' motion\r\nfor reconsideration and reiterated he was deciding the case only on the one\r\nground explained in the original order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case, in which the essential facts are largely undisputed, raises\r\na novel question of law.1 We are free to decide this question of law with no\r\nparticular deference to the lower court. See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9; S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1998); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200\r\n(Supp. 1998) (granting Supreme Court and Court of Appeals the jurisdiction to\r\ncorrect errors of law in both law and equity actions).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n      Did the circuit judge err in ruling that zoning matters in Town may be decided only under the specific procedures set forth in Title 6 and not by the general initiative and referendum process contained in Title 5?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n      Must a party who prevails in the lower court raise an \"additional sustaining ground\" to the judge and obtain a ruling in order to preserve that issue for appellate review? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ZONING BY INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the circuit judge erred in striking down the\r\nproposed referendum. Appellants contend the Legislature intended for the\r\nprovisions in Titles 5 and 6 to act in conjunction with one another. They believe\r\nthe two titles are alternative and complementary means of enacting zoning\r\nlegislation, and the adoption of the detailed zoning mechanism of Title 6 does\r\nnot prohibit the enactment of zoning ordinances pursuant to the Title 5\r\ninitiative and referendum process. Appellants argue the Legislature has\r\ndecided that \"any ordinance,\" except for ones explicitly prohibited, may be\r\nenacted by initiative and referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe disagree with appellants and conclude the Legislature could not\r\nhave intended to allow zoning by referendum for two reasons. First, the conflict\r\nbetween the relatively free-ranging Title 5 initiative and referendum process\r\nand the elaborate, detailed zoning procedures contained in Title 6 are\r\nincompatible and hopelessly inconsistent. Second, allowing zoning by initiative\r\nand referendum potentially would nullify zoning and land use rules developed\r\nafter extensive debate among a variety of interested persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE TWO PROCESSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and\r\neffectuate the legislative intent whenever possible. Bankers Trust of South\r\nCarolina v. Bruce, 275 S.C. 35, 267 S.E.2d 424 (1980). A statute as a whole\r\nmust receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the\r\npurpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers. State v. Baker, 3.10 S.C. 510, 427\r\nS.E.2d 670 (1993). Statutes in apparent conflict should, if reasonably possible,\r\nbe construed to allow both to stand and to give effect to each. Chris J. Yahnis\r\nCoastal, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co., 295 S.C. 243, 368 S.E.2d 64 (1988).\r\nGenerally, specific laws prevail over general laws, and later legislation takes\r\nprecedence over earlier legislation. Lloyd v. Lloyd, 295 S.C. 55, 367 S.E.2d 153\r\n(1988).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-17-10 (Supp. 1998), first enacted in 1962,\r\nprovides that \"electors of a municipality may propose any ordinance, except an\r\nordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes.\" The petition\r\ncontaining the proposed ordinance must be signed by qualified electors of the\r\nmunicipality equal in number to at least fifteen percent of the registered voters\r\nat the last regular municipal election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-17-30.(1976), also enacted in 1962, requires the\r\ncouncil to submit the proposed ordinance to voters in a referendum when it fails\r\nto pass the ordinance or passes it in a form substantially different from that set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforth in the petition.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above statutes are found in Title 5, which contains various\r\nprovisions governing municipal corporations, ranging from incorporation and\r\nform of government to building codes and streets and sidewalks. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§Â§ 5-1-10 to 5-37-90 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1998).\r\nUntil this year, Chapter 23 of Title 5 contained zoning and planning\r\nprovisions for municipalities, while Chapter 7 of Title 6 contained zoning and\r\nplanning provisions available to both municipal and county governments. The\r\n\"South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Enabling Act\r\nof 1994\" repealed existing zoning and planning provisions in Title 5 and Title\r\n6 as of May 3, 1999. Act No. 355, 1994 Acts 4010. The 1994 Act combined the\r\nprovisions into a single, comprehensive set of provisions available to local\r\ngovernments. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 6-29-710 to -960 (Supp. 1998) (codifying\r\nportions of 1994 Act).3\r\nUnder Title 6, \"[z]oning ordinances must be for the general purposes\r\nof guiding development in accordance with existing and future needs and\r\npromoting the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, appearance,\r\nprosperity, and general welfare.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-710(A) (Supp. 1998).\r\nGoals include the prevention of overcrowding of people, buildings, and traffic;\r\nthe preservation of historic and ecologically sensitive areas; and the adequate\r\nprovision of services to residents. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZoning regulations must address numerous factors, including\r\nbuilding size, density of development, parking, and buffer areas. A local\r\ngoverning body may use a variety of zoning techniques, including planned\r\ndevelopment districts such as the one at issue in this case. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6\r\n29-720 and -740 (Supp. 1998). The local planning commission ox governing\r\nbody must hold a public hearing before enacting or amending zoning\r\nregulations or maps, and must follow detailed procedures in conducting that\r\nhearing. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-760(A) (Supp. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governing body may create a board of zoning appeals to help\r\nresolve disputes, and that board must follow specific procedures in hearing and\r\ndeciding cases. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 6-29-780 and -800 (Supp. 1998). The board's\r\ndecisions may be appealed to circuit and appellate courts. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 6\r\n29-820 to -850 (Supp. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZoning and planning provisions in the repealed portions of Titles 5\r\nand 6, and the new provisions in the 1994 Act, do not mention zoning by\r\nreferendum. None contains any explicit guidance on whether the Legislature\r\nintended to let municipal voters enact zoning measures under the Title 5\r\ninitiative and referendum process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome courts have concluded that zoning by initiative and\r\nreferendum is permissible despite detailed procedures contained in zoning\r\nstatutes.4 Other courts have prohibited such initiatives and referenda, finding\r\nthat the detailed nature of zoning acts indicates a legislative intent that zoning\r\nmatters must be decided only in the manner specified in those acts.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe the latter view is the better one. We decline to interpret\r\nthe \"any ordinance\" language in Section 5-17-10 to encompass zoning by\r\ninitiative and referendum. The obvious incompatibility between the initiative\r\nand referendum process and the comprehensive Title 6 provisions indicates the\r\nLegislature did not intend to allow voters to enact more complex zoning\r\nmeasures by initiative and referendum. Furthermore, the Title 6 provisions\r\nenacted in 1994 address the matter of zoning in detail. We conclude the\r\nLegislature intended for this more specific and more recent enactment to take\r\nprecedence over the general initiative and referendum process enacted thirty\r\nseven years ago. See Lloyd v. Lloyd, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. NULLIFICATION OF CAREFULLY DEVELOPED RULES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZoning often is one of the most controversial activities undertaken\r\nby a local government. Some citizens view zoning as a requisite in today's\r\nworld, necessary to control disparate uses of land, promote orderly development,\r\nand conserve valuable resources. To others, zoning raises the specter of an\r\noverbearing government bent on destroying individual property rights and\r\nindependent spirits. As aptly expressed by the New Jersey Supreme Court,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In municipal government, few issues generate as much\r\n    public interest as the control of land-use development.\r\n    Zoning ordinances touch people where they live.\r\n    Sensitive to the intense public interest in local land-use\r\n    development, the Legislature has developed an orderly\r\n    structure for public participation in the process. That\r\n    process also contemplates the rational development of\r\n    land use, free from undue political influence.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Borough of Point Pleasant, 644 A.2d 598,\r\n600 (N.J. 1994). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the comprehensive and detailed nature of the Title 6\r\nprovisions briefly outlined above reveals our Legislature's intent that zoning\r\ndecisions should be made by a cross-section of unbiased officials after careful\r\ndeliberation. Whether the zoning decisions involve the development of an\r\noverall zoning system or master plan, or the application of established rules in\r\na particular case, Title 6 is designed to allow ample planning and ensure due\r\nprocess for all interested parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legislature has recognized by its enactment of detailed\r\nprocedures in Title 6 that haphazard or thoughtless decisions are the antithesis\r\nof meaningful zoning. We agree with Developer that the Legislature has not\r\ncondoned - and we should not approve - a process by which voters could\r\ncircumvent this deliberative process by deciding zoning matters in an initiative\r\nand referendum process. Such a system ultimately could nullify a carefully\r\nestablished zoning system or master plan developed after debate among many\r\ninterested persons and entities, resulting in arbitrary decisions and patchwork\r\nzoning with little rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the circuit judge's ruling and hold that\r\nzoning provisions may not be enacted by the initiative and referendum process\r\ncontained in Sections 5-17-10 and -30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ADDITIONAL SUSTAINING GROUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit judge based his ruling on the ground discussed in Issue\r\n1. At a hearing on appellants' motion for reconsideration, appellants questioned\r\na footnote in the judge's final order which stated, \"Of course, if this order is\r\nappealed, [Developer] will be able to argue its other positions as additional\r\nsustaining grounds.\" The judge told appellants that his ruling was based only\r\non the one ground outlined in the final order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloper did not ask the judge to rule on any other grounds,\r\nbelieving it could raise those matters on appeal as additional sustaining\r\ngrounds under the authority of Rule 220(c), SCACR (appellate court may affirm\r\nfor any reason appearing in the record). The parties expressed confusion about\r\nthe need for a ruling on the additional grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloper, the prevailing party below, now raises several additional\r\nissues and arguments that were not ruled upon by the circuit judge. We find,\r\nfor the reasons explained below, that it was proper for Developer to raise those\r\nissues and arguments. We further find it unnecessary to address any of them\r\nbecause Issue 1 is dispositive. However, we take this opportunity to review and\r\nclarify the law regarding additional sustaining grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn raising an additional sustaining ground in an appeal, the party\r\nwho prevailed in the lower court urges an appellate court to affirm the lower\r\ncourt's ruling for a reason other than one primarily relied upon by the lower\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder appellate practice rules in effect prior to 1990, a respondent\r\n- as the prevailing party below - properly could raise an additional sustaining\r\nground if (1) the ground related to a matter that was presented to and ruled\r\nupon by the trial judge and (2) accepting the ground would lead to the same\r\nresult that the trial judge had reached.6 Colonial Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. v. South\r\nCarolina Tax Comm'n, 233 S.C. 129, 140-41, 108 S.E.2d 908, 913-14 (1958).\r\nThe Court explained in Colonial Life that the practice of raising additional\r\nsustaining grounds dates back at least to 1889, and it is not necessary for the\r\nparty who prevailed below to object to or appeal from the trial court's ruling in\r\norder to raise such grounds. Appellate courts adhered to the Colonial Life\r\nprinciples until the present appellate court rules took effect in 1990.7 Rule 102,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn revising the appellate court rules, we intended to abandon\r\nrestrictions surrounding additional sustaining grounds and allow a more\r\nflexible process. We chose to avoid using the term \"additional sustaining\r\nground\" in the present appellate court rules. Instead, the present rules provide\r\nsimply that \"[r]espondent's brief may also contain argument asking the court\r\nto affirm for any ground appearing on the record as provided by Rule 220(c),\r\n[SCACR].\" Rule 208(b)(2), SCACR. Rule 220(c), in turn, provides that \"[t]he\r\nappellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s)\r\nappearing in the Record on Appeal.\"8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1995, the Court of Appeals resurrected the pre-1990 principles\r\nby refusing to consider an additional sustaining ground because the party who\r\nprevailed below had not both presented the argument and obtained a ruling on\r\nit from the trial judge. O'Tuel v. Villani, 318 S.C. 24, 31 n.l, 455 S.E.2d 698,\r\n702 n.l (Ct. App. 1995). Two years later, we cited O'Tuel in reaching the same\r\nconclusion. Brashier v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., 327 S.C. 179, 186 n.7,\r\n490 S.E.2d 8, 12 n.7 (1997). Both O'Tuel and Brashier relied upon Carter v.\r\nPeace, 229 S.C. 346, 93 S.E.2d 113 (1956), in which the Court held that even if\r\na matter was raised to the trial judge, any proposition relied on as an additional\r\nsustaining ground must be presented to and passed on by the trial judge to\r\nwarrant consideration on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals has cited Brashier or O'Tuel three times\r\nrecently in denying appellate review of an additional sustaining ground because\r\nit was not both presented to and ruled on by the lower court. Shealy v. South\r\nCarolina Dep't of Social Servs., 334 S.C. 187, 193, 511 S.E.2d 713, 715-16 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1999), cert. granted, September 10, 1999; Osprey v. Cabana Ltd.\r\nPartnership, 333 S.C. 323, 332 n.7, 509 S.E.2d 275, 280 n.7 (Ct. App. 1998),\r\ncert. granted, August 19,1999; Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp.,\r\n329 S.C. 414, 420, 496 S.E.2d 637, 640 (Ct. App. 1998) (en banc), cert. granted\r\nFebruary 10, 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the present rules, a respondent - the \"winner\" in the lower\r\ncourt - may raise on appeal any additional reasons the appellate court should\r\naffirm the lower court's ruling, regardless of whether those reasons have been\r\npresented to or ruled on by the lower court. It would be inefficient and pointless\r\nto require a respondent to return to the judge and ask for a ruling on other\r\narguments to preserve them for appellate review. It also could violate the\r\nprinciple that a court usually should refrain from deciding unnecessary\r\nquestions. Cf. Fairway Ford, Inc. v. County of Greenville, 324 S.C. 84, 476\r\nS.E.2d 490 (1996) (illustrating Court's \"firm policy\" of declining to reach\r\nconstitutional issues when it is not necessary to resolve a case).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basis for respondent's additional sustaining grounds must\r\nappear in the record on appeal, but other requirements contained in former\r\nrules and pre-1990 precedent no longer apply. Of course, a respondent may\r\nabandon an additional sustaining ground under the present rules - just as a\r\nrespondent could under the former rules - by failing to raise it in the appellate\r\nbrief. Maxey v. R.L. Bryan Co., 295 S.C. 334, 336 n.2, 368 S.E.2d 466, 467 n.2\r\n(Ct. App. 1988); May v. Hopkinson, 289 S.C. 549, 558, 347 S.E.2d 508, 513 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1986); see also Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"[o]rdinarily, no point will be\r\nconsidered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appellate court may review respondent's additional reasons\r\nand, if convinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason\r\nappearing in the record to affirm the lower court's judgment. An appellate court\r\nmay not rely on Rule 220(c), SCACR, when the reason does not appear in the\r\nrecord, or when the court believes it would be unwise or unjust to do so in a\r\nparticular case. It is within the appellate court's discretion whether to address\r\nany additional sustaining grounds.9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsequently, it is not always necessary for a respondent - as the\r\nwinning party in the lower court - to present his issues and arguments to the\r\nlower court and obtain a ruling on them in order to preserve an issue for\r\nappellate review. This approach is in keeping with the view, as expressed in\r\nRule 220(c), SCACR, that an appellate court may affirm the lower court's\r\njudgment for any reason appearing in the record on appeal. An affirmance\r\npromotes judicial economy and finality in private and public affairs, which are\r\nimportant public policies. E.g., Kreutner v. David, 320 S.C. 283, 465 S.E.2d 88\r\n(1995) (appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record);\r\nState v. Johnson, 278 S.C. 668, 301 S.E.2d 138 (1983) (same).10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn clarifying the law, we do not mean to dilute the important\r\nprinciple that all parties should raise all necessary issues and arguments to the\r\nlower court and attempt to obtain a ruling. While the current rules do not\r\nrequire the respondent to present an issue to the lower court in order to raise\r\nit as an additional sustaining ground, an appellate court is less likely to rely on\r\nsuch a ground when the respondent has failed to present it to the lower court.\r\nIn such cases, the appellate court likely would perceive it as being unfair or\r\nunwise to resolve a. case on a ground never mentioned by the respondent prior\r\nto appeal. Stated another way, the respondent may raise an additional\r\nsustaining ground that was not even presented to the lower court, but the\r\nappellate court is likely to ignore it.11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrast, different preservation rules apply to an appellant - the\r\nlosing party in the lower court. An appellate court may not, of course, reverse\r\nfor any reason appearing in the record. The losing party must first try to\r\nconvince the lower court it is has ruled wrongly and then, if that effort fails,\r\nconvince the appellate court that the lower court erred. This principle underlies\r\nthe long-established preservation requirement that the losing party generally\r\nmust both present his issues and arguments to the lower court and obtain a\r\nruling before an appellate court will review those issues and arguments. E.g.,\r\nSmith v. Phillips, 318 S.C. 453, 458 S.E.2d 427 (1995) (appellate court generally\r\nwill not address an issue unless the issue was raised to and ruled upon by the\r\ntrial court); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991) (same);\r\nSumter Building &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Winn, 45 S.C. 381, 23 S.E. 29 (1895) (same).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the losing party has raised an issue in the lower court, but the\r\ncourt fails to rule upon it, the party must file a motion to alter or amend the\r\njudgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate review. E.g., Pelican Bldg.\r\nCenters of Horry-Georgetovvn, Inc. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 427 S.E.2d 673\r\n(1993); Hoffman v. Powell, 298 S.C. 338, 380 S.E.2d 821(1989); see also Rules\r\n52(b) and 59(e), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant\r\nto enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant\r\nfacts, law, and arguments. See Roche v. South Carolina Alcoholic Beverage\r\nControl Comm'n, 263 S.C. 451, 211 S.E.2d 243 (1975) (purpose of an appeal is\r\nto determine whether the trial judge erroneously acted or failed to act and when\r\nappellant's contentions are not presented or passed on by the trial judge, such\r\ncontentions will not be considered on appeal). The requirement also serves as\r\na keen incentive for a party to prepare a case thoroughly. It prevents a party\r\nfrom keeping an ace card up his sleeve - intentionally or by chance - in the hope\r\nthat an appellate court will accept that ace card and, via a reversal, give him\r\nanother opportunity to prove his case. See Brown v. Singletary, 226 S.C. 482,\r\n85 S.E.2d 738 (1955) (party may not neglect or ignore vices in the trial, then\r\nexpect to assert those vices on appeal in case of disappointment at trial); State\r\nv. Warren, 207 S.C. 126, 134, 35 S.E.2d 38, 41 (1945) (same).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, while we clarify the law on additional sustaining grounds,\r\nwe emphasize that all parties should raise all necessary arguments to the lower\r\ncourt and attempt to obtain a ruling. However, when the lower court rules in\r\none party's favor, it is not necessary for that party to return to the court and ask\r\nfor a ruling on remaining issues and arguments in order to preserve those\r\narguments for use in an appeal. To the extent that recent cases follow the pre-1990 rules on additional sustaining grounds, they are overruled. 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the circuit judge and hold that zoning by initiative and\r\nreferendum is not allowed in South Carolina pursuant to Sections 5-17-10 and\r\n-30. We review and clarify the law on additional sustaining grounds, but find\r\nit unnecessary to address such grounds raised by Developer in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In Burnside v. Town of Arcadia Lakes, 271 S.C. 191, 246 S.E.2d 234 (1978), the Court upheld the trial court's denial of Burnside's pretrial motion to dismiss a defense relating to a zoning referendum the town already had held. It was too early in the litigation to dismiss the town's referendum defense, the Court reasoned. The Court observed that \"council was required pursuant to [Section 5-17-10 and -30] to call a referendum and abide by its results,\" but did not address the propriety of the zoning referendum. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Nearly identical provisions provide for an initiative and referendumprocess in county government matters. S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-9-1210 to -1230 (1986).  \r\n3 The 1994 Act is codified at S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-29-310 to -1200 (Supp. 1998). The Act repealed S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5-23-10 to -740 and 6-7-310 to -1110 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1998).\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nMunicipal governments could follow either set of the former provisions until their repeal this year, and they could implement the 1994 Act at any time. See Fairfield Ocean Ride. Inc. v. Town of Edisto Beach, 294 S.C. 475, 479 n.2, 366 S.E.2d 15, 18 n.2 (Ct. App. 1988) (recognizing that the Title 5 provisions apply only to municipal governments while the Title 6 provisions apply to both municipal and county governments); Johnston v. City of Myrtle Beach, 283 S.C. 288, 291-92, 321 S.E.2d 627, 628-29 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding that zoning provisions in Titles 5 and 6 exist harmoniously, and the earlier Title 5 provisions were not impliedly repealed when Legislature enacted the Title 6 provisions); Act No. 355, 1994 Acts 4036 (identifying repealed sections and stating that \"[d]uring the intervening five years, this act is cumulative and may be implemented at any time\").\r\n4 See Devita v. County, of Napa, 889 P.2d 1019,1026 (Cal. 1995) (en banc) (local initiative process found in state constitution may be used to amend general land use plan); Margolis v. District Court, 638 P.2d 297, 304 (Colo. 1981) (en banc) (zoning and rezoning are legislative acts subject to challenge \r\nunder initiative and referendum process reserved to people in state constitution); Greens at Fort Missoula v. City of Missoula, 897 P.2d 1078,1080 82 (Mont. 1995) (zoning and rezoning are legislative acts subject to challenge under initiative and referendum process reserved to people in state constitution); Citizen's Awareness Now v. Marakis, 873 P.2d 1117, 1125-26 (Utah 1994) (allowing zoning by referendum only if the matter may be deemed legislative (as opposed to administrative) in nature and it is \"material variance\" from basic zoning law that is appropriate for voter consideration); see also Annots., 72 A.L.R.3d 991 &sect; 6[a] and 1030 &sect; 4 (1976) (collecting cases in which courts have found the initiative and referendum process compatible with the specific notice and hearing process contained in most zoning statutes).\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n5 See Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Borough of Point Pleasant, 644 A.2d 598, 601-03 (ICJ. 1994) (citing cases in which New Jersey appellate courts prohibited zoning by referendum prior to statutory prohibition because such measures would circumvent statutory procedural requirements and effectively remove local governmental bodies from land use planning); Korash v. City of Livonia, 202 N.W.2d 803 (Mich. 1972) (recognizing the conflict and holding that procedures in zoning act must be strictly adhered to; thus, zoning by initiative is prohibited); see also Annots., 72 A.L.R.3d 991 &sect; 6[b] and 1030 &sect; 6 (1976) (collecting cases in which courts have found the initiative and referendum incompatible with the specific notice and hearing process contained in most zoning statutes).\r\n6The respondent also had to timely notify the appellant that he intended to raise certain additional sustaining grounds when he notified the appellant of any amendments to the proposed record. The Court eliminated former Supreme Court Rule 4, Section 7, which contained the notice requirement, in 1977. Under present rules, the appellant receives notice of the respondent's additional sustaining grounds through the respondent's brief. The appellant may address those additional grounds in a reply brief. Rule 208(a)(3), SCACR.  \r\n7 E.g., Rental Uniform Serv. of Florence, Inc. v. Dudley, 278 S.C. 674, 676, 301 S.E.2d 142, 144 (1983); South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 244 S.C. 466, 479, 137 S.E.2d 507, 512 (1964); Carter v. Peace, 229 S.C. 346, 354, 93 S.E.2d 113, 117 (1956); Kizer v. Woodmen of the World, 177 S.C. 70, 75, 180 S.E. 804, 806 (1935); Self v. Goodrich, 300 S.C. 349, 353, 387 S.E.2d 713, 715 (Ct. App. 1989); Action Mortg. Corp. v. Van Deusen, 291 S.C. 208, 213, 352 S.E.2d 711, 714 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n8The present rules mention the term \"additional sustaining ground\" only once. See Rule 227(f), SCACR (certiorari to review post-conviction relief actions).\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe term \"additional sustaining ground\" is an extremely common one that is still widely used today in South Carolina. Given its continuing use, we abandon any effort to avoid use of the term and instead just clarify the law surrounding it. In raising such grounds in an appeal, parties may use the term or simply refer to Rule 208(b)(2), SCACR.\r\n9 The appellate court may find it unnecessary to discuss respondent's additional sustaining grounds when its affirmance is grounded in an issue addressed by the lower court. E.g., South Carolina Federal Say. Bank v. Atlantic Land Title Co., 314 S.C. 292, 298 n.5, 442 S.E.2d 630, 633 n.5 (Ct. App. 1994) (affirming lower court's decision and declining to discuss additional sustaining grounds). The appellate court may or may not wish to address such grounds when it reverses the lower court's decision. E.g., Smith v. Haynsworth3 Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 438, 472 S.E.2d 612, 615 (1996) (reversing lower court and declining to discuss additional sustaining grounds); Huff v. Jennings, 319 S.C. 142, 148, 459 S.E.2d 886, 890 (Ct. App. 1995) (reversing lower court's decision and discussing additional sustaining ground). \r\n10 Accord Far North Sanitation. Inc. v. Alaska Pub. Util. Comm'n, 825 P.2d 867 (Alaska 1992) (appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in record); State v. McCowen, 297 N.W.2d 226 (Iowa 1980) (same); State v. Boggess, 512 S.E.2d 189 (W. Va. 1998) (same); Valentine v. Ormsbee Exploration Corp., 665 P.2d 452 (Wyo. 1983) (same); Greenbriar Condominium Apts. II Assoc. v. Koch, 480 So.2d 131 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985) (same); McCarthy v. Yempku, 678 P.2d 11 (Haw. Ct. App. 1984) (same).  \r\n11 The Court appears to have imposed, in a case decided after the new appellate court rules took effect, a pre-1990 requirement that additional sustaining grounds be presented to the lower court to be available for consideration on appeal. Nichols v Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, 305 S.C. 323, 328, 408 S.E.2d 237, 240 (1991), overruled on other grounds, Lewis v Local 382 Intern Broth. of Elec. Workers (AFL-CIO), 335 S.C. 562, 518 S.E.2d 583 (1999). Nichols arose prior to 1990. As explained above, the current rules do not impose any presentation requirement. However, the failure to present an additional sustaining ground to the lower court reduces the likelihood an appellate court will rely on it to affirm a judgment.\r\n12 Those cases include Brashier v.

Out of his rather\r\nlengthy criminal history, the portion relevant to this case can be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n      On December 16, 1986, Respondent pled guilty to one offense of Burglary, Second for which the trial judge sentenced him to 6 years, suspended for 5 years probation. Respondent also pled guilty to one offense of petit larceny for which the trial judge sentenced him to 30 days suspended during probation; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n      On June 19, 1987, Respondent was charged with violating his probation. The trial court decided to continue his probation; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      3.\r\n      On May 24, 1988, a second probation violation warrant was issued but not immediately served on Respondent because he had \"absconded the supervision\" of the State; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      4.\r\n      On July 15, 1988, in Respondent's absence, a trial court hearing found Respondent was again in violation of his probation based on the May 24, 1988 warrant. The trial court revoked Respondent's 5 year probation, ordered a bench warrant to be issued for Respondent's arrest, and ordered a hearing be held to affirm Respondent's probation revocation upon his capture; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      5.\r\n      On December 12, 1988, Respondent was brought before the trial court on new charges of two counts of Distribution of Cocaine. Respondent pled guilty and the trial court sentenced Respondent to 15 years for each count, suspended to 5 years probation and shock probation. After the hearing, Respondent was also served with the warrant issued pursuant to the July 15, 1988 order finding a violating of his probation; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      6.\r\n      On December 13, 1988, Respondent was brought back in front of the trial court, apparently for the affirmation hearing. At that time, the trial court delayed having an affirmation hearing on the July 15, 1988 order and revocation of Respondent's suspension so it could evaluate Respondent's response to shock probation; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      7.\r\n      In April 1989, the probation office caused a warrant to be issued against Respondent for violating shock probation; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      8.\r\n      On January 4, 1990, Respondent pled guilty to a new charge of Possession with the Intent to Distribute Cocaine. At the hearing, the trial court sentenced Respondent to 12 years to run \"consecutive to any other sentence.\" The trial court also affirmed the July 15, 1988 order revoking Respondent's 5 year probation. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs a result of the January 4, 1990 guilty plea and probation revocation,\r\nRespondent received 12 years in prison consecutive to whatever time is included\r\nfrom his 6 year sentence in 1986. Respondent filed a PCR petition alleging that\r\nthe trial court could not affirm the revocation of his 5 year probation because the\r\nJuly 15, 1988 trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction. The PCR judge\r\nagreed and declared both the July 15, 1988 probation revocation and January 4,\r\n1990 affirmation of that revocation void. The State appealed and the issue before\r\nthe Court is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR court err in finding the trial court that revoked\r\n    Respondent's probation did not have subject matter jurisdiction\r\n    where a warrant had been issued but not served on Respondent?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Propriety of the Probation Revocation Hearing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues the PCR court erred in finding the July 15, 1988 trial\r\ncourt could not revoke Respondent's probation when, even though a warrant had\r\nbeen issued, Respondent had not been served with that warrant. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-450 to 460 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1998) and South\r\nCarolina case law require a warrant to be issued and the probationer served with\r\nthe warrant in order to revoke probation. Section 24-21-450 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  At any time during the period of probation or suspension of\r\n    sentence the court, or the court within the venue of which the\r\n    violation occurs, or the probation agent may issue or cause the\r\n    issuing of a warrant and cause the defendant to be arrested for\r\n    violating any of the conditions of probation or suspension of\r\n    sentence .... In case of an arrest, the arresting officer or agent must\r\n    have a written warrant from the probation agent setter forth that\r\n    the probationer has, in his ,judgment, violated the conditions of\r\n    probation, and such statement shall be warrant for the detention of\r\n    such probationer in the county jail or other appropriate place of\r\n    detention, until such probationer can be brought before the judge of\r\n    the court or of the court within the venue of which the violation\r\n    occurs... (emphasis added).\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 24-21-460 goes on to explain:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Upon such arrest the court, or the court within the venue of\r\n    which the violation occurs, shall cause the defendant to be brought\r\n    before it and may revoke the probation or suspension of sentence\r\n    and shall proceed to deal with the case as if there had been no\r\n    probation or suspension of sentence . . . (emphasis added).\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nThese code sections contemplate both the issuance of a warrant and the\r\narrest of the probationer pursuant to that warrant before probation can be\r\nrevoked. In Sanders v. MacDougall, 244 S.C. 160, 163-64, 135 S.E.2d 836, 837\r\n(1964), this Court held that probation revocation \"can be done only by a court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction before which the defendant has been taken on a warrant\r\ncharging a violation of the conditions of probation.\" (emphasis added). In the\r\ncurrent case, although a warrant had been issued prior to the July 15, 1988\r\nhearing, that warrant had not been served on Respondent and Respondent was\r\nnot taken before the trial court during the revocation hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court has found \"that a probationer is entitled to a hearing on the\r\nquestion of revocation.\" Lovell. State, 223 S.C. 112, 74 S.E.2d 570 (1953).\r\nWhile \"the probation revocation proceeding is not a criminal trial of those\r\ncharges . . . but a more informal proceeding with respect to notice and proof of\r\nthe alleged violations,\" see State v. Franks, 276 S.C. 636, 281 S.E.2d 227 (1981),\r\nunder the State's position, the State would be required to give no notice to the\r\nprobationer before revoking probation. The State would only have to have an\r\naffirmation hearing upholding the revocation once the probationer is served with\r\nthe warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State relies on State v. Felder, 313 S.C. 55, 437 S.E.2d 315 (1993) for\r\nthe proposition that the issuance of the bench warrant gave the July 15, 1988\r\ncourt the authority to hold the hearing. This Court in Felder stated: \"If a warrant\r\nhas not been issued, the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to revoke\r\nprobation and any attempted revocation is a nullity .... The issuance of the\r\ncitation and affidavit in this case was sufficient to give the circuit court\r\njurisdiction to revoke appellant's probation.\" Id. at 56, 437 S.E.2d. at 315. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin v. State\r\nissue in Felder was whether a probation revocation hearing could be commenced\r\nbased on a citation instead of a warrant. Unlike the present case, the\r\nprobationer in Felder had been served and appeared before the court at the\r\nprobation revocation hearing. The case only addressed whether a citation is the\r\nequivalent of a warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Respondent's Waiver of the Hearing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that even if the July 15, 1988 revocation hearing was\r\nimproper, Respondent was afforded due process and he waived his right to a\r\nhearing on the probation revocation. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though the probation revocation in the July 15, 1988 hearing was\r\nimproper, when Respondent was properly brought before the court on January 4,\r\n1990 after being served with the warrant, he waived his right to a hearing. The\r\nfollowing exchange took place between the trial court and Respondent:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      COURT: \r\n      Anything you want to tell me?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      MARTIN:\r\n      No, sir. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      COURT: \r\n      You want to back up and have a hearing? \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      MARTIN: \r\n      No, sir. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      COURT: \r\n      They say you weren't here and it was done in your absence and if you've got a good reason, I'd be glad to set that aside and hear it and do it over. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSince Respondent had been served with the warrant and was present at the\r\nJanuary 4, 1990 hearing, the trial court had the authority to revoke Respondent's\r\nprobation at that hearing, even if the original revocation was improper. While\r\nthis Court has held that \"apparent waiver of the statutory requirements cannot\r\nconfer jurisdiction upon the court,\" State v. Richburg, 274 S.C. 220, 260 S.E.2d\r\n44 (1980), here the State met the statutory requirements of section 24-41-450\r\nbecause Respondent had been served with the warrant and was present. He was\r\nnot waiving jurisdictional requirements, only his due process right to a hearing\r\non the matter of probation revocation. Therefore, even though the January 4,\r\n1990 hearing may not count as an affirmation of the original probation\r\nrevocation, it was a proper probation revocation hearing on its own merits.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we REVERSE the PCR court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25050","title":"State v.

Washington (\"Defendant\") appeals\r\nhis conviction and life sentence. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAround 5:15 p.m. on May 29, 1996, Defendant kicked in a back door and\r\nentered Larry Blakely's residence intending to rob the house. Unfortunately for\r\nDefendant, Blakely, a police officer with the Greenville County Police Department, returned home while Defendant was still in the house. Officer Blakely drew his weapon and detained Defendant until more police arrived on the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on Defendant's record of one previous common law burglary\r\nconviction and two previous housebreaking convictions, the State indicted Defendant for burglary, first degree under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2)\r\n(Supp. 1998).1 The previous convictions were the only aggravating circumstances elevating the break-in to burglary, first degree. Without the previous convictions, the State would have charged Defendant with burglary, second degree for the Blakely break-in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) when, in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime: \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  (a) is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive; or \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (b) causes physical injury to a person who is not a participant in the crime; or \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (c) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (d) displays what is or appears to be a knife, pistol,\r\n  revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm; or \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (2) the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of both; or \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (3) the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n\r\nPrior to trial, the State served notice on the Defendant that if convicted,\r\nthe State would also use Defendant's prior convictions to seek a life sentence\r\npursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 1998)(the \"repeat offender\r\nstatute\"). Under section 17-25-45(C)(1), Defendant's current burglary charge\r\nconstitutes a \"most serious\" offense. The State claimed Defendant's prior\r\nconviction for common law burglary also constitutes a \"most serious\" offense.\r\nA jury convicted Defendant of burglary, first degree for the Blakely break-in\r\nand the trial judge sentenced Defendant to life without parole based on his\r\nfinding the common law burglary conviction was a \"most serious\" offense.\r\nDefendant appealed the following issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Whether Defendant's life sentence as a repeat offender\r\n    violates the Fifth and Eighth Amendments of the United\r\n    States constitution prohibiting double jeopardy and cruel and\r\n    unusual punishment?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  2. Whether Defendant's previous convictions were sufficient to\r\n    bring him within the purview of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45\r\n    (Supp. 1998)(the repeat offender statute)? \r\n  3. Whether Defendant received adequate notice of the State's\r\n    intention to seek life without parole as required by S.C. Code\r\n    Ann. Â§17-25-45 (Supp. 1998)(the repeat offender statute)? \r\n  4. Whether the trial judge committed reversible error in\r\n    refusing to charge all of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Supp.\r\n    1998)(the burglary, first degree statute)? \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Double Jeopardy/Cruel and Unusual Punishment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant argues that using his previous burglary and housebreaking\r\nconvictions to establish a case for burglary, first degree in the current case and\r\nthen relying on the previous convictions and the current burglary, first degree\r\nconviction to impose a life sentence under the repeat offender statute\r\nconstitutes double jeopardy along with cruel and unusual punishment. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, double jeopardy does not prevent the use of Defendant's prior\r\nconvictions as an element of the crime burglary, first degree under section 16-11-311. \"The fact that prior convictions comprise one element of an offense does\r\nnot offend the double jeopardy clause . . .\" United States u. Lurz, 666 F.2d 69,\r\n77 (4th Cir. 1981). Here, section 16-11-311 allows the State to punish\r\nDefendant's recidivism by -using his previous convictions to elevate actions that\r\nwould normally constitute a burglary, second degree charge to a charge of\r\nburglary, first degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, under the repeat offender statute the State may use prior\r\nconvictions to enhance Defendant's sentence for a current conviction without\r\noffending double jeopardy. \"An enhanced sentence imposed on a persistent\r\noffender thus `is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty\r\nfor the earlier crimes' but as `a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is\r\nconsidered to be an aggravated offense because it is a repetitive one.\"' Monge\r\nv. California, 524 U.S. 721, ___, 118 S. Ct. 2246, 2250, 141 L. Ed. 2d 615, ___,\r\n(1998). \"The Supreme Court has held that a state legislature may, if it wishes,\r\nprovide that a defendant shall be convicted of the crime of being a recidivist,\r\nupon proof of prior convictions.\" Lurz, 666 F.2d at 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Crawford, 18 F.3d 1173 (4th Cir. 1994), cited by\r\nDefendant, supports the constitutionality of the current statute. In Crawford,\r\nthe Fourth Circuit upheld the use of a prior conviction under the federal\r\nsentencing guidelines to enhance the current offense level and then to increase\r\nthe level of punishment after the jury convicted Crawford of the enhanced\r\noffense. See Crawford, 18 F.3d at 1179. As in Crawford, Defendant's prior\r\nconvictions allowed an increase in the level of the current offense and then\r\nraised the level of punishment Defendant could receive after the current\r\nconviction. However, Defendant's current sentence does not punish him a\r\nsecond time for his previous transgression. Instead, the State is punishing\r\nDefendant to a greater extent for the current offense due to his repetitive illegal\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE USE OF DEFENDANT'S COMMON LAW BURGLARY CONVICTION AND\r\nSECTION 17-25-45\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant argues that the State cannot use his prior convictions of\r\ncommon law burglary and housebreaking to seek a life sentence without parole\r\nbecause those prior offenses are not listed in section 17-25-45 as \"most serious\"\r\nor \"serious\" offenses. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1985, the Legislature rewrote the law on burglary. Under the previous\r\nstatutes, the common law defined the crime of burglary. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n16-11-310 (repealed 1985).2 Under the common law, burglary was: \"[T]he\r\noffense of breaking and entering the dwelling house of another in the nighttime\r\nwith the intent to commit a felony therein.\" State v. Brooks, 277 S. C. 111, 114,\r\n283 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1981). In 1985, section 16-11-311 replaced the prior\r\nburglary statute. The elements of common law burglary now constitute\r\nburglary, first degree under section 16-11-311(A)(3). In other words, common\r\nlaw burglary is legally the equivalent of burglary, first degree.3 Since\r\nDefendant had pled guilty to common law burglary in 1982, the trial court\r\nproperly ruled that this prior conviction would constitute a \"most serious\"\r\noffense because it contained the same legal elements as burglary, first degree\r\nthat section 17-25-45(C)(1) declares a \"most serious\" offense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEEK LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE UNDER SECTION 17-25-45\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant argues the State could not seek life without parole under\r\nsection 17-25-45 because it failed to send him a second intent notice after he\r\nwas re-indicted. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State is required by law to inform a defendant that it plans to seek\r\nenhanced sentencing for recidivist conduct under the provisions of the repeat\r\noffender statute. Section 17-25-45(H) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Where the solicitor is required to seek or determines to seek\r\n    sentencing of a defendant under this section, written notice must\r\n    be given by the solicitor to the defendant and defendant's counsel\r\nnot less than ten days before trial.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State indicted Defendant and sent him written notice that it would seek life\r\nwithout parole under section 17-25-45. Due to errors in the original indictment,\r\nthe State later re-indicted Defendant. After the re-indictment, the State did not\r\nsend a second notice of intent to Defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State was not precluded from applying section 17-25-45 because, even\r\nwithout a second notice, Defendant had actual notice that the State would be\r\nseeking life without parole. This Court has found that under such notice\r\nstatutes, the law only requires actual notice. See State v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387,\r\n472 S.E.2d 235 (1996)(finding that actual notice of the State's intention to seek\r\nthe death penalty is all that the death penalty's notice statute required); see\r\nalso State v. Young, 319 S.C. 33, 459 S.E.2d 84 (1995)(finding that the State is\r\nnot required to serve a second Notice of Intent to Seek the Death Penalty at re\r\nsentencing where the original sentence was overturned on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current situation is factually similar to State v. McWee. In McWee,\r\nthe State indicted the defendant for murder in 1992, and sent written notice\r\nwith that indictment that the State would seek the death penalty. McWee was\r\nlater re-indicted in 1993 and notice to seek the death penalty was not given\r\nfollowing this second indictment. The Court found that McWee's knowledge\r\nfrom the original notice that the State intended to seek the death penalty\r\nsatisfied that notice statute. McWee, at 390-91, 472 S.E.2d at 238. Here,\r\nDefendant does not dispute that the original notice provided actual notice of the\r\nState's intention to seek life imprisonment without parole. Since Defendant\r\nhad actual notice of the State's intent, a second notice following re-indictment\r\nwas unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Jury Charge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant argues that the trial judge erred by not charging the jury all\r\nof section 16-11-311. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Defendant put forth the theory that a burglary, first degree\r\nconviction based on section 16-11-311(A)(2) is a mere \"technicality.\" To support\r\nthis theory, Defendant wanted the judge to charge section 16-11-311(A) in its\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant argued that section 16-11-311(A)(1) and (3)'s aggravating\r\ncircumstances (i.e., using deadly weapons or causing physical injury) were\r\nreally burglary, first degree and that section (2) shouldn't count as burglary,\r\nfirst degree. In his closing, Defendant's counsel argued to the jury:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is no violence in this case. There is no weapon. This is not\r\n    a nighttime burglary. This is a burglary second charge which they\r\n    want to elevate to a burglary first based on his prior record.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  This is a classic burglary second case. He was caught red handed\r\n    in the act. No violence. Total cooperation. Made a statement. Sat\r\n    down. No problem. No resistance. Daylight hours. And they want\r\n    you to convict him on a technicality . . .\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant's counsel reiterated this argument when he asked the judge to\r\ncharge section 16-11-311 in its entirety: \"It fits with my theory of the defense\r\nthat I'm asking them not to convict because they're trying to convict him on a\r\ntechnicality and he does not meet the other requirements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConviction for burglary, first degree as a result of entering a dwelling\r\nwithout consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling combined\r\nwith a recidivist record for criminal offenses is not a conviction based on a\r\n\"technicality.\" \"The Legislature has the power, within constitutional limits, to\r\ndefine and punish crimes.\" Guinyard v. State, 260 S.C. 220, 226, 195 S.E.2d\r\n392, 395 (1973). The Legislature has chosen to punish recidivist criminal\r\nactivity by allowing a prior record to constitute one element of burglary, first\r\ndegree. As discussed in Section I, supra, the Legislature has the constitutional\r\nauthority to punish such recidivist activity with an increase in the level of the\r\nlatest offense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause Defendant's \"technicality\" theory has no merit, the trial judge did\r\nnot err in refusing to charge the statutory sections inapplicable to the current\r\ncase. Jury instructions by the court of irrelevant and inapplicable principles\r\nmay be confusing to the jury and can be reversible error. See Miller v. Schmid\r\nLaboratories, Inc., 307 S.C. 140, 142-43, 414 S.E.2d 126, 127 (1992)(\"The\r\ninstructions by the court of irrelevant and inapplicable principles of law was\r\nclearly erroneous and may have been confusing to the jury.\"). Since sections 16\r\n11-311(A)(1) and (3) were inapplicable to the current case, the trial judge did\r\nnot err by refusing to read those sections to the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, Defendant's conviction and sentence are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1&sect; 16-11-311.

Savitz, III, of South\r\n  Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for\r\n  appellant.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy\r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III,\r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Walter M. Bailey, Jr., of\r\n  Summerville, for respondent.\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J.: Timothy Rogers has appealed his death sentence for murder.\r\n  He argues that the resentencing judge improperly denied his request for a\r\n  mitigating jury charge. We disagree and affirm.  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThere are different versions of the factual events leading up to Timothy\r\n  Rogers's shooting of Stephanie Burditt. These accounts, and the history of this\r\n  case, can be found in our decision State v. Rogers, 320 S.C. 520, 466 S.E.2d 360\r\n  (1996).\r\nOn November 25, 1992, Rogers shot and killed nine-year-old Stephanie\r\n  Burditt. A jury found Rogers guilty of murder. On appeal, this Court affirmed\r\n  Rogers's murder conviction, but reversed his death sentence and remanded for\r\n  resentencing due to jury instruction errors made during the sentencing phase.1\r\n  At Rogers's resentencing, the State again sought the death penalty based on the\r\n  following aggravating circumstances: (1) Rogers, by his act of murder, knowingly\r\n  created a great risk of death to more than one person in a public place by means\r\n  of a weapon or device which normally would be hazardous to the lives of more\r\n  than one person; and (2) Rogers killed a child under the age of eleven-years-old.\r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a) (Supp. 1998). The jury returned a unanimous\r\n  finding that Rogers had killed a child under the age of eleven and recommended\r\n  death. The judge imposed the sentence of death.\r\nPrior to his murder conviction, Rogers's criminal record included:\r\n\r\n  (1) November 1985: Trespassing After Notice; \r\n  (2) July 1986: Carrying a Pistol; \r\n  (3) April 1987: Possession of Marijuana; \r\n  (4) July 1987: Shoplifting; \r\n  (5) March 1988: Resisting Arrest; \r\n  (6) December 1988: Grand Larceny of a Vehicle; \r\n  (7) September 1990: Possession of Cocaine; \r\n  (8) August 1992: Criminal Sexual Conduct with a Minor; \r\n  (9) September 1992: Criminal Sexual Conduct with a Minor.\r\n\r\nTonya Bickham, a witness to the killing of Stephanie Burditt, had been Rogers's\r\n  girlfriend before his arrest and conviction for murder. At the time, Ms. Bickham\r\n  was only fifteen-years-old and Rogers's two CSC convictions are a result of their\r\n  relationship. Ms. Bickham is also the mother to one of Rogers's five children and\r\n  was pregnant with this child at the time of the murder. The only evidence\r\n  produced at trial shows that their sexual relationship was mutually desired.\r\nDuring Rogers's resentencing, defense counsel requested the judge to give\r\n  the statutory mitigating charge as set out in S.C. Code Ann Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(1)\r\n  (Supp. 1998). The judge refused because he believed Rogers's previous\r\n  convictions of CSC second prevented giving the charge. The issue before this\r\n  Court is whether the judge erred by refusing to instruct the jury, under S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(1), to consider that Rogers had \"no significant history\r\n  of prior criminal conviction involving the use of violence against another person.\"\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C) (Supp.1998), the trial judge must\r\n  submit for the jury's consideration any statutory mitigating circumstances\r\n  supported by the evidence. State v. Victor, 300 S.C. 220, 224, 387 S.E.2d 248,\r\n  250 (1989). Once the trial judge has made an initial determination of which\r\n  statutory mitigating circumstances are supported by the evidence, the defendant\r\n  shall be given an opportunity on the record: (1) to waive the submission of those\r\n  he does not wish considered by the jury; and (2) to request any additional\r\n  mitigating statutory circumstances supported by the evidence that he wishes\r\n  submitted to the jury. Id. Under section 16-3-20(C)(b)(1), if the judge makes the\r\n  determination that the defendant does not have \"a significant history of prior\r\n  criminal conviction involving the use of violence against another person\" then\r\n  he is entitled to the mitigating jury charge stating that fact to the jury. When\r\n  the General Assembly enacted the death penalty statute in its current form on\r\n  June 8, 1977, the Code did not define for trial judges which crimes involved\r\n  \"violence against another person\" that would preclude giving this mitigating jury\r\n  charge.\r\nOur primary function in interpreting the death penalty statute, as with\r\n  any statute, is to ascertain the intention of the General Assembly. See Busby v. Moore, 330 S.C. 201, 203, 498 S.E.2d 883, 884 (1998)(\"The Court's primary\r\n  function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General\r\n  Assembly.\"). In 1986, the legislature enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 which\r\n  states: \"For purposes of definition under South Carolina law a violent crime\r\n  includes the offenses . . . criminal sexual conduct with minors, first and second\r\n  degree.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60. By providing a list of the crimes which are\r\n  to be defined as violent, the legislature ended the necessity for a case-by-case\r\n  analysis into the specific convictions of each defendant's history. The lengthy\r\n  list of statutory sections found in the \"cross references\" to section 16-1-60 reveals\r\n  the legislative intention for a uniform definition of violent crimes throughout the\r\n  Code. We do not believe the legislature intended there to be situations where\r\n  the courts would treat offenses defined as \"violent crimes\" under one section and\r\n  not treat these same offenses as \"crimes involving the use of violence\" under\r\n  another section of the same title.\r\nCSC second is a \"violent crime\" under section 16-1-60. See also Gaster v. Euatt, 326 S.C. 33, 483 S.E.2d 197, 198 (1997).2 Rogers argues that his two\r\n  convictions should not be treated as \"crimes involving violence against another\r\n  person\" because he contends his sexual conduct with a minor was consensual\r\n  and therefore should not constitute a \"prior criminal conviction involving the use\r\n  of -violence against another person.\" We disagree. In section 16-1-60 the\r\n  legislature spoke on the issue of which crimes are violent crimes and which\r\n  crimes are not. Rogers's construction of the law would result in cases where\r\n  offenses designated as violent crimes by the legislature would not be considered\r\n  violent by the court. Rogers's argument also ignores the legislature's intent and\r\n  policy in enacting the CSC second statute. See Doe by Doe v. Greenville Hosp. System, 323 S.C. 33, 37, 448 S.E.2d 564, 566 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"As a matter of\r\n  public policy, the General Assembly has determined a minor under the age of\r\n  sixteen is not capable of voluntarily consenting to a sexual battery committed by\r\n  an older person.\").\r\nIn the current case, the legislature designated Rogers's CSC offenses as\r\n  violent crimes. The courts need not conduct any further inquiry into the facts\r\n  of each conviction to make a determination regarding Roger's entitlement to the\r\n  mitigating charge provided in section 16-3-20(C)(b)(1).3\r\n\r\n 2 In Rogers's first trial, this Court noted that \"Rogers was convicted of violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655 (1985) (criminal sexual conduct with a minor), which\r\ncrimes we find constituted violent crimes . . . .\" State v. Rogers, 320 S.C. 520, 526 n. 1,\r\n466 S.E.2d 360, 363 n.1 (1996). Although this recognition is not the law of the case in\r\nthe current matter, the results reached are the same.\r\n3 We are aware there may be some crimes involving violence against another\r\n  person that are not part of the list in section 16-1-60, noticeably among them is the\r\n  common law offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN).\r\n  Since the legislature has undertaken the responsibility to designate which offenses\r\n  the courts will consider violent, if the General Assembly wishes to add ABHAN or any\r\n  other crime to the list of violent offenses, it is within their power to do so.\r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nUpon review the entire record in this case, we conclude the death sentence\r\n  was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the\r\n  jury's finding of statutory aggravating circumstances is supported by the\r\n  evidence. See S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985). Further, the death penalty is\r\n  neither excessive nor disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases. See State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998); State v. Humphries, 325 S.C.\r\n  28, 479 S.E.2d 52 (1996).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Rogers's sentence is AFFIRMED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur. BURNETT, A.J.,\r\n  concurring separately in result.  \r\n BURNETT, A.J.: While I concur in the result reached by the\r\n  majority, I disagree the enactment of Â§ 16-1-60 \"ended the necessity for a\r\n  case-by-case analysis.\" I have reservations about this limitation on judges'\r\n  discretion and its impact on pending cases. Although I agree there are no\r\n  situations where the courts would not treat offenses defined as \"violent\r\n  crimes\" under one section as \"crimes involving the use of violence\" under\r\n  another section, the converse is not necessarily true. Section 16-1-60\r\n  encompasses statutory crimes, yet common law crimes may also involve the\r\n  use of violence against another person. For example, as the majority notes,\r\n  common law assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN)\r\n  is not included in Â§ 16-1-60's list of violent crimes. The interpretation of Â§\r\n  16-3-20(C)(b)(1) given by the majority precludes use of common law crimes of\r\n  violence in a death penalty case. The legislature could not have intended for\r\n  criminals with a history of violent common law crimes to be entitled to a\r\n  mitigating jury charge that they have \"no significant history of prior criminal\r\n  conviction involving the use of violence against another person.\" \r\n  \r\n  1 The trial court improperly denied Rogers a Simmons charge on parole ineligibility. See Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994) (holding that when a capital defendant would be ineligible for parole if sentenced to life in prison and the State argues the defendant's future dangerousness as a basis for imposition of the death penalty, the defendant is entitled to have the jury informed of his ineligibility for parole either by way of arguments by defense counsel or instruction by the trial judge). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25051","title":"State v.

We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant voluntarily presented himself to the Lexington County Sheriff's Department on May 29, 1995, for questioning concerning his involvement in a murder, armed robbery, and assault which took place earlier that day. He agreed to take a polygraph examination. After administering the examination, the detective left appellant in the polygraph room and returned to his own office. A video camera in the polygraph room fed into the detective's office. Appellant's attorney joined appellant in the polygraph room. While appellant and his attorney conferred, several sheriff's officers and a deputy solicitor were present in the detective's office where the privileged conversation between appellant and his attorney was monitored and recorded. Several of the detectives present testified at\r\nappellant's trial that when one of the detectives asked the deputy solicitor, \"Can we use this?,\" the deputy solicitor replied, \"I'm not sure, but if we do, it will be an interesting Supreme Court case.\" The fact of the eavesdropping and the existence of the videotape were not revealed to appellant or his attorneys for two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant was subsequently arrested and indicted. While in jail awaiting trial, appellant made incriminating statements to a cellmate who testified against him at trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deputy solicitor who participated in the eavesdropping was an active participant in appellant's trial and gave the closing argument in the guilt phase of the trial. The jury convicted appellant and recommended a sentence of death. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.

Did the trial judge err in refusing to disqualify the Eleventh\r\n    Circuit Solicitor's Office from prosecuting appellant?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in refusing to disqualify the\r\nsolicitor's office from prosecuting him after a deputy solicitor participated in\r\nthe videotaping of appellant's conversation with his attorney. Appellant\r\nmakes two arguments for disqualification. First, he argues his Sixth\r\nAmendment right to counsel1 was violated when investigators and the\r\ndeputy solicitor eavesdropped on his conversation with his attorney, and\r\ndisqualification of the solicitor's office is an appropriate remedy for the\r\nviolation. Second, he argues the solicitor's office should have been\r\ndisqualified because the deputy solicitor's misconduct and his subsequent\r\nparticipation in appellant's trial was an affront to the integrity of the judicial\r\nsystem. We agree with each of these contentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Was appellant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel violated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated\r\nand the solicitor's office should have been disqualified as a result. We agree.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel protects the integrity of the\r\nadversarial system of criminal justice by ensuring that all persons accused of\r\ncrimes have access to effective assistance of counsel for their defense. The\r\nright is grounded in \"the presumed inability of a defendant to make informed\r\nchoices about the preparation and conduct of his defense.\" United States v.\r\nLevy, 577 F.2d 200, 209 (3d Cir. 1978). Although the Sixth Amendment\r\nright to counsel is distinguishable from the attorney-client privilege, the two\r\nconcepts overlap in many ways. The right to counsel would be meaningless\r\nwithout the protection of free and open communication between client and\r\ncounsel. See id. The United States Supreme Court has noted that\r\n\"conferences between counsel and accused . . . sometimes partake of the\r\ninviolable character of the confessional.\" Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 61\r\n(1932).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1932, the United States Supreme Court declared the Sixth\r\nAmendment applicable to the states through the due process clause of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment. Id. However, South Carolina had recognized the\r\nfundamental nature of the right to counsel as early as 1731. See id. (\"[I]n\r\nSouth Carolina, the original Constitution of 1776 did not contain the\r\nprovision as to counsel, but it was provided as early as 1731 that every\r\nperson charged with treason, murder, felony, or other capital offense, should\r\nbe admitted to make full defense by counsel learned in the law.\") (citing Act\r\nof August 20, 1731, Â§ XLIII, Grimke, S. Car. Pub. Laws, 1682-1790, p. 130).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is, fortunately, a case of first impression in South Carolina. Never\r\nbefore have we addressed a case involving deliberate prosecutorial intrusion\r\ninto a privileged conversation between a criminal defendant and his\r\nattorney. Federal jurisprudence in this area is decidedly ambiguous, and we\r\nhave found no precedent dealing with a prosecutor deliberately\r\neavesdropping on an accused and his attorney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, when first faced with cases involving\r\ngovernment eavesdropping on attorney-client conversations, federal courts\r\nrefused to examine either the government's motives or the degree of\r\nprejudice to the defendant. Note, Government Intrusions Into the Defense\r\nCamp: Undermining the Right to Counsel, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1143, 1146\r\n(1984). Over time, the rule that began to emerge would have required either\r\na showing of deliberate prosecutorial misconduct or prejudice, but not both.\r\nSee State of South Dakota v. Long, 465 F.2d 65 (1972) (\"It is certainly true\r\nthat where there is gross misconduct on the part of the Government, no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprejudice need be shown.\") (citing Black v. United States, 385 U.S. 26 (1966),\r\nO'Brien v. United States, 386 U.S. 345 (1967), Caldwell v. United States, 205\r\nF.2d 879 (D.C. Cir. 1953), Coplon v. United States, 191 F.2d 749 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1951)); Fajeriak v. State, 520 P.2d 795 (Alaska 1974) (\"Following Coplon,\r\ncourts have agreed that proof of deliberate eavesdropping upon attorney\r\nclient communications automatically invalidates a conviction. The United\r\nStates Supreme Court implicitly adopted this rule in Black v. United\r\nStates.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1977, the United States Supreme Court appeared to alter this\r\nstandard in Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545 (1977). Weatherford\r\ninvolved an informant/codefendant who attended meetings between Bursey\r\nand his attorney. The Supreme Court found no Sixth Amendment violation\r\nwhere there was no tainted evidence, no communication of defense strategy\r\nto the prosecution, and no purposeful intrusion by the government. Id. at\r\n558. The Court held that establishing a violation of a defendant's Sixth\r\nAmendment right to counsel requires a showing of \"at least a realistic\r\npossibility\" of prejudice. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the government interceptions in Weatherford were\r\n\"unintended and undisclosed\" (id. at 565, Marshall, J., dissenting), the Court\r\ndid not address whether the rule would be different in a case involving\r\ndeliberate misconduct by the government. Nor did the Court decide who\r\nbears the burden of proving prejudice. In 1988, the Supreme Court declined\r\nto hear a case that would have resolved a hopeless conflict among the circuits\r\non that issue. See Cutillo v. Cinelli, 485 U.S. 1037 (1988). Dissenting from\r\nthe denial of certiorari, Justice White, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice\r\nO'Connor, summarized the positions taken by the various circuits. At one\r\nextreme are those courts which require the defendant to prove prejudice. At\r\nthe other extreme are those which find a per se violation of the Sixth\r\nAmendment when the prosecution improperly obtains confidential defense\r\nstrategy information or intentionally places an informer in the defense camp.\r\nIn the middle are those courts which hold that where confidential defense\r\nstrategy information is transmitted to the prosecution and the defendant\r\nmakes a prima facie showing of prejudice, the burden then shifts to the\r\nprosecution to prove there was no prejudice to the defendant from the\r\ndisclosure. Id. Thus, we have little guidance from the federal courts on this\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeatherford is inapplicable to the case sub judice, where a member of\r\nthe prosecution team intentionally eavesdropped on a confidential defense\r\nconversation. We conclude, consistent with existing federal precedent, that a\r\ndefendant must show either deliberate prosecutorial misconduct or prejudice\r\nto make out a violation of the Sixth Amendment, but not both. Deliberate\r\nprosecutorial misconduct raises an irrebuttable presumption of prejudice.\r\nThe content of the protected communication is not relevant. The focus must\r\nbe on the misconduct. In cases involving unintentional intrusions into the\r\nattorney-client relationship, the defendant must make a prima facie showing\r\nof prejudice to shift the burden to the prosecution to prove the defendant was\r\nnot prejudiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause a deputy solicitor of the Eleventh Circuit Solicitor's Office\r\neavesdropped on a privileged conversation between appellant and his\r\nattorney, we reverse appellant's conviction and disqualify the Eleventh\r\nCircuit Solicitor's office from prosecuting appellant at his new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Should the solicitor's office have been disqualified\r\nto protect the integrity of the judicial system?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have disqualified the Eleventh Circuit Solicitor's Office\r\nfrom prosecuting appellant, we address appellant's second assertion because\r\nof its importance to judges, attorneys, criminal defendants, and indeed all\r\ncitizens of this state. Every South Carolinian has a vital interest in the fair\r\nadministration of justice. This Court bears the ultimate responsibility for\r\nmaintaining judicial integrity and high standards of professional conduct\r\namong the members of the bar, and for protecting and defending the\r\nconstitutional rights of the accused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe integrity of the entire judicial system is called into question by\r\nconduct such as that engaged in by the deputy solicitor and investigating\r\nofficers in this case. Prosecutors are ministers of justice and not merely\r\nadvocates. See Rule 3.8, cmt., Rules of Professional Conduct. A prosecutor\r\nhas special responsibilities to do justice and is held to the highest standards\r\nof professional ethics. The participation at trial of a prosecutor who has\r\neavesdropped on the accused and his attorney tarnishes us all. We will not\r\ntolerate deliberate prosecutorial misconduct which threatens rights\r\nfundamental to liberty and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Did the trial judge err in refusing to allow appellant to impeach law\r\nenforcement witnesses with their participation in the videotaping?\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in not allowing him to\r\n  impeach law enforcement witnesses with their participation in the\r\nvideotaping of his conversation with his attorney. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, a trial court's ruling on the proper scope of\r\ncross-examination will not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse of\r\ndiscretion. State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 196, 498 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1998).\r\nUnder Rule 608(b), SCRE, specific instances of a witness's misconduct\r\n  may be inquired into on cross-examination if probative of the witness's\r\n  character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. The inquiry under Rule 608(b)\r\n  is limited to those specific instances of misconduct which are clearly\r\n  probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness such as forgery, bribery, false\r\n  pretenses, and embezzlement. State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 75, 502 S.E.2d\r\n  63, 75 (1998) (citing Weinstein's Federal Evidence, Character and Conduct of\r\n  Witness Â§ 608.12(4)(a-b) (1998)). Rule 608(c), SCRE, permits impeachment\r\n  of a witness with evidence of \"bias, prejudice or any motive to misrepresent.\"\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe occurrence of the videotaping is not relevant to any trial issue.\r\nAny mention of the videotape, even by the defense, could have jeopardized\r\nthe trial by raising questions in jurors' minds about the contents-of the tape.\r\nThe trial judge made every effort to prevent jurors from knowing about the\r\nvideotape. His refusal to allow the questioning was not an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Did the trial judge err in ruling appellant's cellmate\r\nwas not a government agent at the time appellant made\r\nincriminating statements to him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in ruling his cellmate was not\r\na government agent at the time appellant made incriminating statements to\r\nhim. Therefore, he argues, the trial court erred in admitting the informant's\r\ntestimony. On the record before us, we disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the government intentionally places a paid informant in close\r\nproximity to a defendant and tells him not to initiate any conversations with\r\nthe defendant but to be alert to any incriminating statements, it violates the\r\naccused's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. United States v. Henry, 447\r\nU.S. 264 (1980), Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964). However,\r\nthe Massiah/Henry rule is not implicated every time an inmate receives\r\ninformation from a fellow inmate and subsequently transmits it to the\r\ngovernment, even when the transmission is made in hope of receiving a\r\nbenefit. See United States v. Stevens, 83 F.3d 60, 64 (2d Cir. 1996). In\r\nStevens, the court found no Sixth Amendment violation where there was\r\nsupport in the record for the trial court's conclusion that the defendant had\r\nbeen the primary initiator of contact with the inmates/informants, and that\r\nthe government never encouraged the contact. Id. at 64-65. In Thomas v.\r\nCox, 708 F.2d 132 (4th Cir. 1983), the Fourth Circuit likewise found no Sixth\r\nAmendment violation where the inmate/informant was \"self-initiated\" and\r\nhad no prior arrangement with the government. The court noted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [F]or whatever reason [the informant] acted - whether \"conscience,\" as the state court found, or \"curiosity,\" as he\r\n    testified, or even conceivably from an unencouraged hope to\r\n    curry favor - he could not properly be characterized, as could the\r\n    informant in Henry, as \"a Government agent expressly\r\n    commissioned to secure evidence.\"\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 136 (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt an in camera hearing to determine the admissibility of the\r\ncellmate's testimony and evidence derived from it, appellant presented\r\nevidence suggesting he was placed in a cell with the other inmate with the\r\nintent that the inmate elicit information from him about the crime.\r\nAppellant further introduced evidence the informant was given special\r\ntreatment in the form of canteen privileges, $1500 worth of dental work, and\r\nrelease on a personal recognizance bond. The State presented evidence\r\ntending to show appellant initiated the conversations, the informant acted on\r\nhis own initiative when he informed on appellant, and the canteen privileges\r\nand dental work were given to the informant in connection with an unrelated\r\ncase. The State also offered an explanation for the informant's release on a\r\npersonal recognizance bond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence concerning the informant's involvement is highly\r\ncontradictory and susceptible of both appellant's and the State's\r\ninterpretations. In some instances, the testimony is diametrically opposed.\r\nFurthermore, there are a disturbing number of unexplained occurrences\r\nsurrounding this event, including the disappearance of jail records for the\r\nthree days encompassing the time appellant was moved into the informant's\r\ncell. However, the trial judge carefully considered both the evidence and\r\nlack thereof and made a well reasoned decision in light of all the evidence\r\nbefore him to admit this testimony. In making his rulings, the trial judge\r\nstated that he had considered the testimony of the various witnesses, with\r\nparticular focus on what could be corroborated by independent facts, and had\r\ntaken into account the interests and biases of the witnesses, as well as their\r\ncredibility. He concluded the informant was not acting as a government\r\nagent at the time appellant initially confessed to him, and allowed the\r\ninformant to testify to statements made by appellant concerning the crime\r\nand the disposal of the stolen property and the weapon. The trial judge\r\nfurther concluded the informant's release on a personal recognizance bond\r\nwas connected to his assistance in locating the murder weapon. He therefore\r\nexcluded both the informant's testimony in that regard and the murder\r\nweapon itself.\r\nAppellant makes no claim - and we see no basis for a claim - that the\r\ntrial judge incorrectly applied the above law to the facts as he found them.\r\nAppellant instead challenges the factual findings underpinning the court's\r\nrulings of law. However, this Court is bound by the trial court's factual\r\nfindings unless they are clearly erroneous. See State v. Amerson, 311 S.C.\r\n316, 320, 428 S.E.2d 871, 873 (1993) (appellate courts are bound by fact\r\nfindings in response to motions preliminary to trial when the findings are\r\nsupported by the evidence and not clearly wrong or controlled by error of\r\nlaw). On the facts in this record, we cannot say the trial court's findings\r\nwere clearly erroneous.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Did the trial judge err in refusing to allow appellant to call\r\nthe solicitor and deputy solicitor to testify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge should have allowed him to call the\r\nsolicitor and deputy solicitor to testify in camera regarding their use of the\r\ninformation contained in the videotape of appellant and his attorney and\r\ntheir knowledge of circumstances surrounding the use of appellant's cellmate\r\nas an informant. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Lee, 203 S.C. 536, 28 S.E.2d 402 (1943), we held a criminal\r\ndefendant has a right to call the prosecuting attorney as a witness, subject to\r\nthe trial court's usual discretion to exclude witnesses or evidence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  It seems to be well settled that litigants, and especially\r\n    defendants in criminal cases, should not be hampered in their\r\n    choice of those by whom they choose to prove their cases. And it\r\nhas been held that they have the right to call as their witness the\r\nprosecuting attorney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 541, 28 S.E.2d 404.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, appellant sought to examine the solicitor and deputy solicitor in\r\ncamera. The court did not articulate its reasons for refusing to allow\r\nappellant to examine the solicitor and deputy solicitor. Thus, it appears the\r\ndecision was controlled by an error of law and was therefore an abuse of the\r\ntrial court's discretion. See Winchester v. United Ins. Co., 231 S.C. 288, 98\r\nS.E.2d 530 (1957) (\"abuse of discretion\" means the trial judge committed an\r\nerror of law in the circumstances).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues any error was harmless because the testimony of the\r\nsolicitor and deputy solicitor would have been cumulative to that of other\r\nwitnesses and to the statement made by the deputy solicitor as an officer of\r\nthe court. We disagree. We have no way of concluding whether the\r\nprosecutors' testimony would have been merely cumulative. The deputy\r\nsolicitor's statements as an officer of the court he was unaware of the\r\ninformant's involvement in this case until a month before trial and he was\r\nadvised by those involved that the informant had received no reward or\r\ninducement in connection with appellant's case were no substitute for under-oath cross-examination. Significantly, his statements did not address the\r\ncritical question of when the informant became a government agent. The\r\ntrial court's error in refusing to allow the cross-examination of the solicitor\r\nand deputy solicitor was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nV. Did the trial judge err in admitting evidence drugs\r\n  were mailed to appellant at the detention center?\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, the State introduced evidence\r\nthat several pieces of mail containing illegal drugs were addressed to\r\nappellant at the Lexington County Detention Center, but never received by\r\nhim. Appellant argues it was error to admit this evidence when the State\r\ncould not show appellant had conspired to have the drugs mailed to him. We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA trial judge is accorded broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility\r\nof testimony. State v. Langley, ___ S.C. ___, 515 S.E.2d 98 (1999). All relevant\r\nevidence is admissible. Rule 402, SORE. Evidence is relevant if it has a\r\ndirect bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the\r\nmatter in controversy. Rule 401, SCRE; State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377,\r\n401 S.E.2d 146 (1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Bailey, 279 S.C. 437, 308 S.E.2d 795 (1983), we held it was\r\nerror for the lower court to allow evidence the appellant's father and brother\r\nhad attempted to procure perjured testimony because \"the effect of its\r\nintroduction into evidence was to create the inference that appellant Bailey\r\nhad attempted through his father and brother to procure perjured testimony,\r\nwhen there was no evidence to connect appellant with the attempt other\r\nthan his blood relationship.\" Id. at 440, 308 S.E.2d 797. The conduct of the\r\nappellant's father and brother \"was irrelevant to the issue of appellant's guilt\r\nor innocence as charged.\" Id. at 439-40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout evidence of some nexus between appellant and the drugs or\r\nevidence appellant conspired to have the drugs sent to him, evidence that\r\ndrugs were addressed to appellant in prison is not relevant to appellant's\r\nadaptability to prison life. The trial court therefore abused its discretion in\r\nadmitting such evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Assoicate Justice\r\nWilliam T. Howell, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\" U.S. CONST. amend. VI. \r\n2The State asserts appellant's Sixth Amendment rights had not yet attached at the time of the eavesdropping and tape recording of appellant's conversation with his attorney. See State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 508-09, 476 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1996) (Sixth Amendment right to counsel in judicial proceedings does not attach until adversarial proceedings have been initiated). This argument ignores the two years during which the State continued adversarial proceedings against appellant while failing to disclose the fact of the eavesdropping and the existence of the videotape. In fact, the occurrence of the videotaping was denied at appellant's preliminary hearing.\r\n3Additional facts may come to light when the solicitor and deputy solicitor are cross-examined.

At the PCR hearing,\r\nrespondent testified he pled guilty so that he would be released from lock-up.\r\nThe PCR judge held respondent's plea was involuntary. The State contends\r\nthis was error. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA plea of nolo contendere is for all practical purposes treated as a\r\nguilty plea. Kibler v.

In his order granting PCR, the\r\nPCR judge stated that \"[w]hen the official policy of the department of\r\ncorrections, an arm of the state, is to punish an inmate until his case is\r\nended, the inmate is pressured to end the case as quickly as possible.\"\r\nHowever, we have held that \"the fact that respondent may have entered a\r\nguilty plea in order to obtain his release from lock-up does not render the\r\nplea involuntary.\" Satterwhite v.

The Consumer\r\nAdvocate appeals on the ground rate increases were ordered without\r\nadequate notice to the public. We reverse and remand. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May 1996, the legislature enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§58-9-280 (L) and\r\n(M) (Supp. 1998) to facilitate the change to a competitive market for local\r\ntelephone services. This legislation would enable incumbent local exchange\r\ncarriers to lower their intrastate toll-switched access rates, which are the\r\nrates paid by long-distance carriers to access the local network, by providing\r\na mechanism to offset the resulting loss of revenue to the local exchange\r\ncarriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal exchange carriers that elected to participate would lower their\r\naccess rates to the level of rates charged by the largest local exchange\r\ncarrier, BellSouth. To help offset the local exchange carriers' resulting loss\r\nof revenue, Â§58-9-280 (M) provided for the Interim Local Exchange Carrier\r\nFund (Fund) to be established by December 31, 1996. Long distance\r\ncompanies that received lowered access rates from the participating local\r\nexchange carriers were required to contribute to the Fund in proportion to\r\nthe amount of the rate reduction they received. Disbursements from the\r\nFund would then be made to the local exchange carriers to offset their loss of\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to disbursements from the Fund, subsection (L) provides\r\nthat the Public Service Commission (PSC) shall allow the adjustment of\r\nother rates charged by participating local exchange carriers in order to offset\r\ntheir lost revenue from lowered access rates.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August 1996, the PSC notified incumbent local exchange carriers of\r\nthe Fund's establishment and that access rate revenue loss would be\r\nrecovered by (1) increases in other rates (not to exceed statewide average\r\nrates) and (2) recovery from the Fund. Local exchange carriers electing to\r\nparticipate in lowered access rates were to notify the PSC of this intention,\r\nprovide financial information regarding lost access rate revenues, and\r\nindicate which method of recovery they would use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 16 and 17, 1996, the PSC held a hearing regarding\r\ndisbursements from the Fund and proposed rate adjustments for the twenty-five local exchange carriers that elected to participate. The Consumer\r\nAdvocate objected on the ground proper notice of rate increases had not been\r\ngiven to the public. The PSC overruled the objection by a vote of five to two.\r\nOn December 31, the PSC issued its order making distributions from the\r\nFund and adjusting rates for the twenty-one participating local exchange\r\ncarriers who are respondents in this appeal (hereinafter \"Telephone\r\nCompanies\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the circuit court affirmed. It found notice was not required\r\nbecause the rate adjustments for participating local exchange carriers in this\r\ncase merely offset revenue losses and were therefore \"revenue neutral.\"\r\nFurther, the circuit court concluded that in any event, the newspaper notice\r\npublished before the hearing was adequate notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Is notice to the public required in this case?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  2. Was the notice given adequate?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  3. Has prejudice been shown?\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Is notice required?\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§58-9-520 (Supp. 1998), a telephone utility\r\nseeking a new rate that affects its general body of subscribers must give the\r\nPS C thirty days' notice of its intent to file for a rate change and must, after\r\nthe thirty days, file a schedule of its proposed changes. Telephone\r\nCompanies did not comply with this notice time line. Under S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§58-9-530 (1976), however, the thirty-day notice may be dispensed with as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes in\r\n    rates without requiring the thirty days' notice under such\r\nconditions as it may prescribe, except that when changes in\r\ngeneral schedules of rates and charges are involved, before they\r\nmay become effective, notice to the public of such proposed\r\nchanges shall be given by publication thereof once a week for\r\ntwo consecutive weeks in newspapers of general circulation in\r\nthe territory involved and a hearing held thereon. All such\r\nchanges shall be immediately indicated upon its schedules by\r\nsuch telephone utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consumer Advocate argues the circuit court erred in finding notice\r\nwas not required in this case. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, there is nothing in Â§58-9-280 exempting from the general notice\r\nrequirements any proceeding under subsections (L) and (M) regarding local\r\nexchange carriers and participation in the Fund. Further, under Â§58-9-530,\r\nthe general notice requirements cannot be waived by the PSC if \"changes in\r\ngeneral rates and charges\" are involved unless the specified newspaper\r\npublication is given. In this case, the PSC ordered rate adjustments in\r\nresidential touch tone and zone charges, and in business touch tone and zone\r\ncharges. These adjustments qualify as \"changes in general rates and\r\ncharges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the fact that these rate adjustments were \"revenue neutral\"\r\nto Telephone Companies does not excuse the public notice requirements.\r\nRate increases are of primary concern to the public and are the essential\r\nreason for requiring notice. In this case, substantial rate increases were\r\nordered over a period of five years in amounts as high as 104% of the current\r\nrates. Since changes in general rates are involved, the notice provision of Â§\r\n58-9-530 requiring publication applies in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Adequacy of notice\r\nOn December 6 and 13, 1996, a notice was published in several\r\nnewspapers identifying the companies involved and announcing a public\r\nhearing \"concerning the proposed rate adjustments filed\" by them. The\r\ncircuit court affirmed the PSC's ruling that this notice was adequate. The\r\nConsumer Advocate contends this was error. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 58-9-530 requires that \"changes in general schedules of rates\r\nand charges\" may not become effective until \"such proposed changes shall be\r\ngiven by publication.\" This statutory provision clearly envisions notice of\r\nwhat changes in rates are sought. The notice in this case references only\r\n\"rate adjustments\" and does not even specify that these adjustments include\r\nincreases. In context, the notice reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  With the passage of House Bill 4694, which was signed by the\r\n    Governor and became, law on May 29, 1996, the Public Service\r\n    Commission is required, not later than December 31, 1996, to\r\n    establish an Interim Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) Fund. The\r\n    purpose of this fund is to address the revenue impact on\r\n    incumbent local exchange carriers electing to reduce toll\r\n    switched access rates.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  In response to this obligation the Public Service Commission of\r\n    South Carolina has received notification and financial impact\r\n    statements from the following Local Exchange Carriers\r\n    concerning their participation in the Interim LEC Fund at this\r\n    time . . . .\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  A copy of the filings may be obtained from . . . .\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  In order for testimony and evidence to be received concerning the\r\n    proposed rate adjustments filed by the aforementioned local\r\n  exchange companies, a public hearing will be held . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe only rates specifically mentioned are the reduced toll switched access\r\nrates referenced in the first paragraph which are not the rates being\r\nconsidered for adjustment. Taken as a whole, this notice is not informative\r\nand in fact is somewhat misleading since one could conclude the \"proposed\r\nrate adjustments\" merely refers to the reduction in toll switched access rates.\r\nWe find the notice given was inadequate to satisfy the requirements of Â§58-9-530.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Prejudice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude the rate increases were ordered without adequate notice\r\nin violation of due process.2 Further, we find substantial prejudice from the\r\nlack of notice. See Tall Tower, Inc. v. South Carolina Procurement Review\r\nPanel, 294 S.C. 225, 363 S.E.2d 863 (1987) (due process claim requires a\r\nshowing of substantial prejudice). The PSC had the discretion under Â§ 58-9-280 (L) to offset lost access rate revenue incurred by the participating local\r\nexchange carriers by increasing other rates and from the Fund. The PSC\r\ndetermined the burden to be imposed on consumers, as opposed to the\r\ncontributing members of the Fund, with no public input. Although there is\r\nno way to determine actual prejudice in the amount of the rate increases\r\nordered, the public was completely deprived of an opportunity to be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remedy requested by the Consumer Advocate is to reverse the\r\norder of the circuit court and remand the matter to the PSC with instructions\r\nto order refunds with interest to consumers who have been paying increased\r\nrates since 1997. The rate increases ordered in this case are scheduled in\r\nincrements from 1997 through 2001. Rather than order refunds, we find a\r\nless drastic remedy is to require the PSC to hold hearings for each local\r\nexchange carrier after adequate notice to the affected customers, re-evaluate\r\nthe total five-year rate increases, and adjust the future scheduled annual\r\nrate increases if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Subsection (L) provides:\r\n\r\n  To offset the adverse effect on the revenues of the incumbent [local exchange carrier], the commission shall allow adjustment of other rates not to exceed statewide average rates, weighted by the number of access lines, and shall allow distributions from [the Fund], as may be necessary to recover those revenues lost through the concurrent reduction of the intrastate switched access rates. \r\n\r\n2 Article I, &sect;22, of our State constitution provides:  \r\n\r\n  No person shall be finally bound by a judicial or quasi judicial decision of an administrative agency affecting private rights except on due notice and an opportunity to be heard . . . . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25055","title":"In the Matter of Floyd","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25055","description":"","date":"2000-01-24","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Floyd\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  \r\n  In The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Jesse J.\r\nFloyd, Jr., Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25055\r\n  Submitted December 20, 1999 - Filed January 24, 2000\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Attorney General Charles M.

Long, of Columbia, for respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21,  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), Rule 413, SCACR. In the.agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to disbarment.1 We accept the agreement.\r\nRespondent admits to the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 1998, in Columbia, respondent stole an automobile from a rental car office at gunpoint, placed several employees in a bathroom, and then drove to a nearby branch of Nationsbank, where he stole approximately $24,000, also at gunpoint. In the course of the robbery, of Nationsbank, respondent shot a bank teller. Respondent was indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, Columbia Division, and charged with robbery of an automobile, use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, robbery of a bank, and use of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence. Respondent was also indicted in the Court of General Sessions for Richland County, on ten different indictments related to entering a bank with intent to steal, assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, and kidnaping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent entered into a plea agreement with the federal\r\ngovernment whereby he agreed to plead guilty to the pending federal charges, all of which were felonies, and in exchange for this plea and other agreements, the State of South Carolina agreed to dismiss its charges pending against him. Respondent pled guilty to all of the federal charges on September 20, 1999.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following\r\nprovisions of the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule\r\n7(a)(1)(violation of a Rule of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(4)(conviction of a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime), Rule 7(a)(5)(conduct demonstrating an unfitness practice law or bringing the legal profession into dispute), and Rule 7(a)(6)(violation of the oath of office taken upon the admission to practice law in this State).

Accordingly, respondent is hereby disbarred for his conduct. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1 By order of this Court, dated September 11, 1998, respondent's license to practice law was placed on Interim Suspension, pursuant to Rule 17(b), RLDE. \r\n2 At the time respondent entered into this agreement with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, he had not yet been sentenced.

Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent\r\n and disciplinary counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand. We accept the agreement and publicly reprimand respondent.\r\n\r\nRespondent was employed by the law firm of E.W. Cromartie, II, in Columbia, as an associate whose primary duty was real estate transactions.  Respondent had the authority to sign on a real estate trust account maintained by the law firm at BB&amp;T Bank in Columbia.\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to comply fully with Rule 417, SCACR, in that he failed to conduct monthly reconciliations of the BB&amp;T trust account, and he did not maintain a trial balance in the real estate trust account, or a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrunning balance for each client by identifying whose money was in the\r\naccount at any given time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to supervise non-lawyer employee(s) who were\r\nresponsible for reconciling the trust account, and ensure correct wiring\r\ninstructions were given to lenders for funds to be wired to the real estate\r\ntrust account. This lack of supervision resulted in funds being wired to\r\nanother trust account maintained by the law firm at BB&amp;T, which led to\r\nnumerous in-branch transfers of funds from the other trust account to the\r\nreal estate trust account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent's title insurance was written through First American\r\nTitle Insurance Company. After a closing took place, deeds and mortgages\r\nwere to be promptly recorded. Outstanding mortgages and other liens were\r\nto be paid immediately. In order to issue a policy of title insurance First\r\nAmerican had to receive a final Certification of Title from respondent.\r\nRespondent failed to properly and timely provide satisfactions of mortgages,\r\nso First American could close out its files in a timely manner. The resulting\r\ndelays ranged from six to eighteen months. First American, in order to\r\nprovide lenders with the policies it was committed to issue, finally had to\r\nutilize its abstractor and abstractors in other counties to provide the\r\nnecessary information.\r\nRespondent wrote a number of checks to First American for title\r\ninsurance from the firm's real estate trust account. First American did not\r\ndeposit these checks until it had received all appropriate information. The\r\nchecks were not negotiated properly because of all the delays involved.\r\nRespondent failed to properly safeguard title insurance money held in the\r\nreal estate trust account, and failed to notify Mr. Cromartie of the identity of\r\nthe funds. Mr. Cromartie, without contacting respondent or making an\r\neffort to determine the exact identity of those funds, assumed they were\r\naccumulated fees and withdrew them. When the title company began\r\ndepositing the premium checks, the checks were returned NSF. Insufficient\r\nfunds were in the trust account for all the checks to be honored.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent left the Cromartie Law Firm on or about January 4,\r\n1998. At the time he left the firm, there were sufficient funds in the real\r\nestate trust account to satisfy the outstanding title insurance premium\r\nchecks. At or about the time Respondent left the firm, approximately six\r\ntrust account checks for title insurance premiums had been returned NSF to First American. First American then stopped depositing the checks, since it\r\nfeared NSF fees. By the time a complaint was made to the Commission on\r\nLawyer Conduct, First American was holding approximately thirty checks. First American sent demand letters to Mr. Cromartie. Mr. Cromartie paid the outstanding premiums by certified checks in the amounts of $1,000.00, dated July 9, 1998, and $7,038.00, dated August 18, 1998. He was refunded $0.17.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\nLawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violated the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaged in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violated the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (competence); Rule 1.3\r\n(diligence); Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property); Rule 8.4(a) (violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaged in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent's conduct warrants a public reprimand.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to either a two year suspension from the practice of law or an indefinite suspension from the practice of law. We accept the agreement for an indefinite suspension.1\r\n\r\n\r\nCriminal Charges\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent pled guilty to several charges, including failure to stop for a blue light, malicious injury to personal property, stalking, and harassment.  Additionally, respondent was convicted of a first offense DUI, possession of the controlled substance Xanax, possession of marijuana, altering a vehicle license, and driving without a license.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nMatter of Trey Fisher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Trey Fisher. Respondent requested\r\nthat Ann Fisher, Trey's mother, give him signed, blank personal checks to\r\npay fines for Trey while Ms. Fisher was out of town. Ms. Fisher complied.\r\nAlthough no fines had been assessed against Trey, respondent filled out one\r\nof the checks in the amount of $20,000.00 and attempted to deposit it into his\r\noperating account. The bank stopped payment on the check due to the large\r\namount. Respondent admits that he did not need that amount of money for\r\nhis client and that he was attempting to divert at least some of those funds\r\nto his own use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Client Matters\r\nRespondent admits that he failed to act with due diligence as to\r\nmatters with his clients Christopher Glover, Norma Maglione, David\r\nMitchell, and Wanda Cox. Respondent failed to respond to initial or\r\nsubsequent inquiries of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel regarding most of\r\nthese complaints.2\r\n\r\n Respondent also failed to do sufficient work to earn his\r\n$500.00 fee in the Mitchell matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubstance Abuse\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that he has had a problem with the use of\r\ncontrolled substances and alcohol. Respondent agrees that he will provide\r\nsatisfactory evidence that he is free from the use of controlled substances or\r\nalcohol with any application for readmission to the practice of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent admits the above misconduct. By his actions, we\r\nfind that respondent has violated numerous provisions of the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct contained in Rule 407, SCACR. He failed to act with\r\nreasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client. Rule 1.3. He\r\nfailed to keep his clients reasonably informed about the status of their cases\r\nand reply to requests for information. Rule 1.4(a). Respondent failed to keep\r\nclient funds separate from his own property, to promptly deliver to a client or third person funds that the client or person was entitled to receive, and to render promptly a full accounting. Rule 1.15 (a),(b), and (c). Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4 (a),(b),(d), and (e). Finally, respondent failed to cooperate with the investigations of the Commission. Rule 7(a)(3), RLDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, respondent's misconduct warrants an indefinite\r\nsuspension from the practice of law. Accordingly, respondent is indefinitely\r\nsuspended. Additionally, respondent agrees to refund the $500.00 fee to his\r\nformer client, David Mitchell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEFINITE\r\nSUSPENSION.\r\n1 Respondent previously received a private reprimand by order dated October 14, 1994.\r\n2 Respondent did respond to complaints regarding his 1996 files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25058","title":"Matter of Rish","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25058","description":"","date":"2000-01-24","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter of Rish\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n.style2 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of E.\r\n          Pickens Rish, Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25058\r\n  Submitted December 20, 1999 - Filed January 24, 2000\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Clifford O.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct, and consents to a public reprimand. Because respondent has agreed to retire by October 29, 2000, we accept the agreement for a public reprimand.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained to represent Client in a traffic court\r\nmatter. Respondent agreed to a fee arrangement with Client of $400 payable in monthly installments of $50. At the initial meeting with Client, respondent advised Client that it would be financially beneficial for her to\r\npay the bond, and that his fee was based on his estimates of the time\r\ninvolved in administrative service, preparation for trial, and his\r\nrepresentation of Client at a jury trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 19, 1997, respondent requested a jury trial on Client's\r\nbehalf. On April 10, 1998, respondent received notice that the case was\r\nscheduled for a trial for the week of April 20, 1998. The trial notice\r\ninstructed respondent to monitor the legal mail system daily to ascertain if\r\nthe case was scheduled for trial in traffic court the next day. On April 17,\r\n1998, respondent contacted the legal mail system and determined that the\r\ncase was not scheduled for April 20, 1998. On April 20, 1998, respondent\r\nstates that, because he was busy and a staff member was out of the office, he\r\ndid not call the legal mail system as directed by the notice from the traffic\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day, April 21, 1998, respondent attended a\r\ndeposition out of town in the morning. Upon his return, respondent\r\ncontacted the legal mail system only to learn that the case was scheduled for\r\ntrial that very morning. As a result of respondent's failure to appear, Client\r\nwas tried, convicted in abstentia, and ordered to pay a $250 fine. Thereafter,\r\nrespondent filed a motion to reopen the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClient was notified of the fine by the court and she gave the\r\nnotice to respondent. Respondent paid the $250 fine at the request of Client.\r\nRespondent was notified that the hearing on the motion to reopen the case\r\nwas scheduled for October 26, 1998. Respondent failed to appear at the\r\nOctober 26th hearing, thus denying Client any defense and effectively\r\nterminating the case to Client's detriment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has violated numerous provisions of the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct contained in Rule 407, SCACR. Respondent failed to\r\nprovide competent representation. Rule 1.1. He failed to abide by the\r\nclient's decisions concerning the objectives of representation, and consult\r\nwith the client as to the means by which they were to be pursued. Rule 1.2.\r\nHe failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness. Rule 1.3. He\r\nfailed to keep his client reasonably informed about the status of the case.\r\nRule 1.4. He failed to set a reasonable fee. Rule 1.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, respondent has violated provisions of the Rules for\r\nLawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, including Rule 7(a)(1)\r\n(violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in\r\nconduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts\r\nor the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness\r\nto practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violation of the oath of office taken upon\r\nadmission to practice law in South Carolina).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded.\r\nRespondent shall submit his resignation as a member of the Bar by October\r\n29, 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Respondent was previously disbarred from the practice of law in Matter of Rish, 273 S.C. 365, 256 S.E.2d 540 (1979).

We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was arrested as a result of an undercover sting operation\r\nconducted by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) in\r\nconjunction with the Conway Police Department. SLED agents parked a van\r\noutside a bar in Conway, where respondent was standing in a group of men.\r\nAn agent called respondent over and asked for a \"twenty,\" meaning a twenty\r\ndollar rock of crack cocaine. Respondent returned to the group of men. The\r\nagents testified respondent returned with the drugs and accepted a marked\r\ntwenty dollar bill. Respondent testified he never went back to the van,\r\nrather, another man in the group, identified as A.J., sold the agents the\r\ncocaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the agents, who was wired with a microphone transmitting to a\r\nsurveillance team nearby, described respondent to the surveillance team,\r\nand respondent was arrested. Respondent testified that when the\r\nsurveillance officers arrived, the men standing with him ran. He did not run\r\n\"because I figure I didn't do anything; I don't need to run anywhere.\" The\r\nmarked twenty dollar bill was not recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, the State impeached respondent with a 1990\r\nconviction for possession of crack cocaine and a 1991 conviction for\r\npossession of cocaine.1 The trial court gave the jury limiting \r\n\r\n  instructions.\r\nThe jury found respondent guilty as charged. Respondent was granted PCR\r\nfor his trial counsel's failure to object that the prejudicial effect of his prior\r\nconvictions outweighed their probative value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR court err in finding trial counsel ineffective for\r\n    failing to object that the prejudicial effect of respondent's prior\r\n    convictions outweighed their probative value?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove\r\nthe allegations in his application. Bell v. State, 321 S.C. 238, 467 S.E.2d 926\r\n(1996); Rule 71.1(e), SCRCP. For an applicant to be granted PCR as a result\r\nof ineffective assistance of counsel, he must show both: (1) his counsel failed\r\nto render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional\r\nnorms, and (2) he was prejudiced by his counsel's ineffective performance.\r\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), Judge v. State, 321 S.C. 554,\r\n471 S.E.2d 146 (1996). In order to prove prejudice, an applicant must show\r\nthat but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result of\r\nthe trial would have been different. Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480\r\nS.E.2d 733 (1997). A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\r\nundermine confidence in the outcome of the trial. Id. If there is any\r\nprobative evidence to support the findings of the PCR judge, those findings\r\nmust be upheld. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).\r\nLikewise, a PCR judge's findings should not be upheld if there is no\r\nprobative evidence to support them. Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470\r\nS.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCR court ruled defense counsel was ineffective for failing to\r\nargue the prejudicial effect of admitting respondent's prior convictions\r\noutweighed their probative value. See Rule 609(a)(1), SORE. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the common law rule, a witness could be impeached by showing\r\nhe was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude as long as it was not too\r\nremote in time2 and its probative value outweighed its prejudicial \r\n\r\n  effect.\r\nRule 609(a)(1) provides a similar two-part test for determining whether a\r\ndefendant's prior convictions can be used to impeach him: (1) the prior crime\r\nmust have been punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year,\r\nand (2) the court must determine that the probative value of admitting the\r\nevidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused. Rule 609(a)(1),\r\nSCRE. Thus, the new evidentiary rule removes the necessity of determining\r\nwhether a crime is one of moral turpitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not previously addressed whether the probative value of a\r\nprior conviction, similar to the crime charged, not involving dishonesty or\r\nfalse statement,3 outweighs its prejudicial effect, where \r\n\r\n  credibility is critical.4\r\nFederal courts have held that prior convictions for the same or similar crimes\r\nare highly prejudicial and should be admitted sparingly. See Jack B.\r\nWeinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence Â§\r\n609.05[3][d] (2d ed. 1999). While some federal circuits have held such\r\nconvictions admissible if, after consideration of other factors, their probative\r\nvalue outweighs their prejudicial effect, the Fourth Circuit has been one of\r\nthe stricter circuits, refusing to permit impeachment with similar prior\r\nconvictions.5 See, e.g., United States v. Sanders; \r\n\r\n  964 F.2d 295, 298-99 (4th\r\nCir. 1992) (in prosecution for assault with a knife, prior conviction for\r\nidentical conduct should have been excluded as highly prejudicial).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe decline to hold similar prior convictions inadmissible in all cases.\r\nTrial courts must weigh the probative value of the prior convictions against\r\ntheir prejudicial effect to the accused and determine, in their discretion,\r\nwhether to admit the evidence. The following factors, along with any other\r\nrelevant factors, should be considered:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. The impeachment value of the prior crime.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  2. The point in time of the conviction and the witness's\r\n    subsequent history.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  3. The similarity between the past crime and the charged crime.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  4. The importance of the defendant's testimony.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  5. The centrality of the credibility issue.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nSee State v. Colf, Op. No. 25038 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 4, 2000) (Shearouse\r\nAdv. Sh. No. 1 at 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, evidence in the record supports the PCR court's\r\nruling that respondent was prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to argue\r\nthe prejudicial effect of the convictions outweighed their probative value.\r\nRespondent was impeached with evidence of two convictions for possession of\r\ncocaine that were four and five years old. His credibility was critical, as the\r\njury had to choose between his version of events and that of the SLED\r\nagents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the State argues any error was cured by the trial court's\r\nlimiting instruction. We disagree. As the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals\r\nnoted in the context of Rule 609(b):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Admission of evidence of a similar offense often does little to\r\n    impeach the credibility of a testifying defendant while\r\n    undoubtedly prejudicing him. The jury, despite limiting\r\n    instructions, can hardly avoid drawing the inference that the\r\n    past conviction suggests some probability that defendant\r\n  committed the similar offense for which he is currently charged.\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 418-19 (4th Cir. 1981) (footnote\r\nomitted). Limiting instructions alone do not make an erroneous admission of\r\nprior conviction evidence harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Respondent's trial took place in 1995. \r\n2 Rule 609(b), SCRE governs admissibility of remote convictions. That rule is not at issue here.\r\n3 Conviction of a crime involving dishonesty or false statement is always admissible for impeachment purposes, regardless of the punishment. Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE. Narcotics convictions generally do not fall under this rule. See Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence &sect; 609.04[3] [d] (2d ed. 1999).\r\n\r\n4 Relying on State v. Lilly, 278 S.C. 499, 299 S.E.2d 329 (1983), the Court of Appeals in State v. Savage, 306 S.C. 5, 409 S.E.2d 809 (Ct. App. 1991), affirmed the trial court's ruling admitting evidence of prior similar narcotics convictions for impeachment purposes over defense counsel's objection that the probative value of the evidence was greatly outweighed by its prejudicial effect. However, Lilly did not address the probative/prejudicial balancing test. In Green v. Hewett, 305 S.C. 238, 407 S.E.2d 651 (1991), we addressed the balancing test in the context of a civil suit for personal injury damages. Green is not dispositive in this case.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n5One tactic the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals employs is to allow the prosecutor to ask the defendant about the existence of prior convictions, but not their nature. See United States v. Boyce, 611 F.2d 530, 531 (4th Cir. 1979) (\"In the special case, where the prior conviction is for the same offense as that for which the defendant is being tried, the trial court generally will not permit the Government to prove the nature of the offense on the ground that to do so would amount to unfair prejudice.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25060","title":"Charleston Lumber v.

Miller Housing\r\nCorp., 329 S.C. 414, 496 S.E.2d 637 (Ct. App. 1998) (Charleston Lumber II).\r\nWe reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Respondent Charleston Lumber Company, Inc.,\r\n(Charleston Lumber) filed several collection actions arising out of billing disputes against Petitioners Miller Housing Corporation and Robert E. Miller, Jr. (Miller). Miller asserted various counterclaims, including fraud and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA).1  In general, Miller claimed Charleston Lumber intentionally and repeatedly submitted low bids on Miller's construction projects, then after Miller selected Charleston Lumber as the lowest bidder, Charleston Lumber delivered the supplies but billed Miller at a higher price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharleston Lumber filed a motion for summary judgment on\r\nMiller's fraud counterclaim. Concluding there were no genuine issues of material fact concerning the fraud elements of representation or damages, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment in June 1992.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the late-1993 trial on Miller's UTPA claim, Miller presented evidence of the number of hours employees spent reconciling Charleston Lumber's billing invoices with its bids and notifying Charleston Lumber of the mistakes. Miller's counsel represented to the court that at the summary judgment hearing in 1992 he did not know Miller had hired an additional employee to handle the Charleston Lumber matter, but two months later, discovered Miller had hired an additional employee. As a discovery sanction, the trial judge refused to allow evidence of the additional employee to be presented to the jury. The trial judge compelled Miller and\r\nCharleston Lumber to submit a stipulation stating Miller did not hire any\r\nemployees to reconcile the Charleston Lumber invoices, pay overtime to\r\nexisting employees, or lose business as a result of the Charleston Lumber\r\nbilling. Miller offered evidence of $53,360 in damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponding to special interrogatories, the jury determined Charleston Lumber violated the UTPA but found Miller had not \"suffered an actual injury as a proximate result of the unfair or deceptive act.\" The jury did not consider the additional employee as an element of damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller appealed several issues, including the grant of summary\r\njudgment on the fraud counterclaim. The Court of Appeals reversed the order granting summary judgment. Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 458 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. 1995) (Charleston Lumber I). In relevant part, the Court of Appeals held:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [t]he trial court incorrectly held as a matter of law that the Millers failed to show the first and last elements of fraud, i.e., a\r\n    representation and damages proximately caused by the\r\n    representation. Id. at 480, S.E.2d at 437;\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  [t]he trial court also improperly ruled as a matter of law that the\r\n    Millers failed to show any damages as a result of the alleged fraud.  The Millers alleged damages of lost employee time based on their personnel having to spend numerous hours each month checking and correcting the bids versus the actual charges. We find that employee time is a compensable damage. Id. at 481, S.E.2d at 437; and\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  [a] further development of the facts is needed to determine the extent of actual damages. Id. at 481, S.E.2d at 437 (emphasis added).\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nCharleston Lumber did not seek review of Charleston Lumber I. On remand, Charleston Lumber again moved for summary judgment, claiming Miller had already litigated its damages in the UTPA action and, therefore, res judicata prevented Miller from relitigating the fraud claim. The trial judge agreed with Charleston Lumber and granted the motion for summary judgment on Miller's fraud claim. The trial court permitted Miller\r\nto supplement the record with the name of the additional employee hired to\r\nreconcile Charleston Lumber's bids and invoices. No order was issued after the supplement was filed. Miller appealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, the Court of Appeals issued a 2-1 decision affirming the trial court. Thereafter, the Court of Appeals granted Miller's petition for rehearing en banc. The Court of Appeals en banc, withdrew its initial opinion, and affirmed the trial court. Charleston Lumber II, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Did Charleston Lumber II err by affirming the trial court's\r\n          failure to abide by the directive of Charleston Lumber I?\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\n      \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nMiller argues the trial court and Charleston Lumber II were bound by the directive in Charleston Lumber I as the law of the case. It maintains the trial judge erred by failing to develop the facts \"needed to determine the extent of actual damages\" as directed by Charleston Lumber I and Charleston Lumber II erred by affirming the trial court. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharleston Lumber I reversed the grant of summary judgment on fraud, specifically found employee time expended on the Charleston Lumber billing was compensable, and remanded for \"development of the facts . . . to determine the extent of actual damages.\" Charleston Lumber I at 481, S.E.2d at 437. This ruling was adverse to Charleston Lumber. Accordingly, it was incumbent upon Charleston Lumber to seek rehearing and/or petition this Court for a writ of certiorari or be bound by Charleston Lumber I as the law of the case. ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 489 S.E.2d 470 (1997) (unappealed ruling is law of the case); Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159,161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) (an unchallenged ruling, \"right or wrong, is the law of this case and requires affirmance.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause Charleston Lumber did not appeal Charleston Lumber I, it was bound by its directive to develop \"the facts needed to determine the extent of [Miller's] actual damages.\" Similarly, Charleston Lumber II was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbound by Charleston Lumber I as the law of the case.3 We conclude the trial judge erred by failing to follow the directive of Charleston Lumber I. Likewise, Charleston Lumber II erred by affirming the trial court. 4 Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a trial on Miller's fraud claim.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n1South Carolina Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-5-10 to -160 (1985). \r\n 2 The trial judge noted Miller did not have to hire additional employees or pay overtime to its employees to perform tasks related to the Charleston Lumber bids and invoices. It noted, however, Miller claimed its personnel spent numerous hours reconciling Charleston Lumber's bids and actual charges.\r\n3 Arguably, Charleston Lumber II could have considered whether Charleston I was correct in reversing the grant of summary judgment, but it did not do so. Cf. Barth v. Barth, 293 S.C. 305, 308, 360 S.E.2d 309, 310 (1987) (\"[t]he rule of the `law of the case' means that what was decided on former appeal is, if evidence is the same on another trial, controlling on the trial court and an appellate court on another appeal, unless on re- examination the appellate court is convinced that the first decision was wrong.\") (emphasis added) with Huggins v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 252 S.C. 353, 357, 166 S.E.2d 297, 299 (1969) (emphasis added) (citation omitted) (\"[i]t is well settled in this jurisdiction that a decision of this court on a former appeal is the law of the case. The questions therein decided are res judicata and this court will not on a subsequent appeal review its former decision . . . . We are not convinced that our former opinion was erroneous, but even if it were, we are precluded, under the settled rule, from reviewing it on this subsequent appeal.\"). \r\n\r\n4 Charleston Lumber II incorrectly suggests res judicata may apply where a subsequent adjudication between the same parties is in the same, rather than a new, action. Res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between those parties. Plum Creek Development Co., Inc., v. Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 512 S.E.2d 106 (1999); Johnson v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 317 S.C. 248, 250, 452 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1994); Reidman Corp. v. Greenville Steel Structure, Inc., 308 S.C. 467, 419 S.E.2d 217 (1992); Sub-Zero Freezer Co. v. R.J. Clarkson Co., 308 S.C. 188, 417 S.E.2d 569 (1992); Beall v. Doe, 281 S.C. 363, 315 S.E.2d 186 (Ct. App. 1984); see 46 Am. Jur.2d Judgments &sect; 596 (1994) (doctrine of res judicata has been regarded as inoperative where the subsequent proceeding is the same and not a new and different action).\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n5 Charleston Lumber did not object to Miller's supplementation of the record at the second motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, Charleston Lumber II improperly ruled the discovery sanction imposed at the UTPA trial continued. Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd., 334 S.C. 96, 512 S.E.2d 510\r\n(Ct. App. 1998), cited by Charleston Lumber in support of its argument it did not have to request the trial judge continue the sanction is inapposite. In Creighton, id., the Court of Appeals held the trial judge erred by dismissing the plaintiff's discovery abuse motion as moot even though the verdict was in favor of the defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
