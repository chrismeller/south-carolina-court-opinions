Â Upchurch v. Upchurch, 359 S.C. 254, 597 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We also review the family courtâ€™s award of child support and denial of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nMichael E. Upchurch (â€œHusbandâ€) and Susan O. Upchurch (â€œWifeâ€) were married in March of 1981.Â  The parties had three children together.Â  They were divorced in February of 2001.Â  \r\nThe parties entered into a separation agreement, which was incorporated into the final divorce decree.Â  The divorce decree granted joint custody to the parties, with Husband designated as the primary custodial parent.Â  At the time of the divorce, the family court relied on the incorporated separation agreement in determining the need for child support. Â The separation agreement provided that â€œ[d]ue to the current financial situation of the parties, including wifeâ€™s establishment of a new household in Charleston, South Carolina, the husband waives child support.Â  The husband and wife may decide to revisit the issue of child support should the financial situation of either party change dramatically.â€ On September 26, 2001, Husband brought a petition requesting that Wife pay private school tuition and child support for their minor children.Â  Wife counterclaimed for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Husband testified about changed circumstances including his oldest daughterâ€™s college expenses, increased medical costs uncovered by insurance, and orthodontic treatment for all three children.Â  Wife objected only to the relevance of testimony regarding the college expenses of the oldest child, these expenses having occurred beyond the daughterâ€™s eighteenth birthday.Â Â  \r\nThe family court denied Husbandâ€™s claim for private school tuition, but granted his petition for child support in accordance with the statutory guidelines, retroactive to the filing of the petition.Â  The family court denied Wifeâ€™s counterclaim for attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nThe family court order was signed on May 30, 2002.Â  The following day, the courtâ€™s administrative assistant mailed the original signed order to the clerk of court with a letter requesting that the clerk file the order and send certified copies to the attorneys of record.Â  This letter, including copies of the signed order, was carbon copied to both attorneys of record.Â  The order was not filed until June 12, 2002.Â  Wife did not receive service of the filed order until August 23, 2002, and on September 11, 2002, Wife appealed.Â  \r\nThe court of appeals dismissed the action as untimely. Â This Court granted certiorari to review the following issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in dismissing Wife&rsquo;s appeal as untimely?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err in awarding child support without a showing of a dramatically changed financial situation or changed circumstances?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Did the family court err in allowing the presentation of evidence regarding changed circumstances? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n    Did the family court err in awarding retroactive child support?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    V.\r\n    Did the family court err in denying Wife&rsquo;s claim for attorney&rsquo;s fees?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing of the Appeal\r\nWife argues that the court of appeals erred in dismissing her appeal as untimely.Â  We agree.\r\nOur Court rules provide that â€œ[a] notice of appeal shall be served on all respondents within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.â€Â  Rule 203(b), SCACR (emphasis added).Â  Generally, a judgment is effective only when so set forth and entered in the record.Â  Rule 58(a) SCRCP.Â  An order is not final until it is entered by the clerk of court; and until the order or judgment is entered by the clerk of the court, the judge retains control of the case.Â  Bowman v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., 335 S.C. 88, 91, 515 S.E.2d 259, 260 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted).Â  However, â€œthe moment â€¦[the order] is filed by the clerk of court, it becomes the judgment of the court, and fixes the rights of the parties.â€Â  Archer v. Long, 46 S.C. 292, 295, 24 S.E. 83, 84 (1896).Â  Stated otherwise, the effective date of an order is not when it is signed by the judge, but when it is entered by the clerk of court.Â  Bowman, 335 S.C. at 93, 515 S.E.2d at 261.Â  \r\nTwo court of appeals cases offer further analysis as to when notice occurs under our procedural rules.\r\nIn Bowman v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., the trial court dismissed the respondent as a party based on the appellantsâ€™ failure to amend the complaint within ten (10) days of the date of the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  Id at 90, 515 S.E.2d at 259.Â  The order was signed on September 19, 1996, but was not entered by the clerk until September 23, 1996.Â  The appellants served an amended complaint on October 2, 1996, which was 13 days after the order was signed and 9 days after the order was filed.Â  The court of appeals held that the appellantâ€™s amendment of the complaint was timely, finding that the â€œfinal and effective date of the trial judgeâ€™s order was the date the order was entered by the clerk of courtâ€¦, not when the order was signed.â€Â  Id at 92, 515 S.E.2d at 261.Â  \r\nIn Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood v. Hiller, the court of appeals addressed the notice requirement under Rule 12(a), SCRCP. [1]Â  307 S.C. 331, 415 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  The appellant in the Rosen case made a motion to the trial court for a change of venue.Â  The motion was denied after the appellant failed to appear at the hearing.Â  The respondentâ€™s attorney mailed a letter to the appellant which included an unsigned, undated, and unfiled copy of the order issued by the court denying appellantâ€™s motion.Â  The respondent subsequently moved for an order of default because the appellant did not file an answer as required by Rule 12(a), SCRCP.Â  Â The appellant argued that he had not received notice of the courtâ€™s action because he had not received the signed, dated, and filed order as required by Rule 77(d), SCRCP.[2]Â  The court of appeals rejected this argument, stating â€œwe see nothing in Rule 12(a) that requires the actual filed order be served upon a party to affect notice [of the courtâ€™s action].â€Â  Id at 334, 415 S.E.2d at 118.\r\nBecause a critical issue of this case is entry of the order of judgment, we find the instant case more comparable with Bowman.Â  In Bowman, the court held that principles of fairness and equity required a finding of timeliness because â€œparties to an action are not provided notice of a judgeâ€™s ruling at the time the judge signs an order.Â  Rather, only after the order is filed with the clerk of court are the parties given notice of the order.â€Â  Bowman, 335 S.C. at 92, 515 S.E.2d at 261.Â  To hold Wife responsible for notice of an event that had not yet occurred runs afoul of the notions of fairness and equity articulated in Bowman.Â  \r\nBy its plain language, Rule 203(b) requires notice of entry of the order.Â  Entry of the order occurs when the clerk of court files the order.Â  Delivery of the order to the clerk is not analogous to the entry of the order.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the time to file a notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 203(b), SCACR, begins to run when written notice that the order has been entered into the record by the clerk of court has been received.Â  Therefore, the May 31st letter from the judgeâ€™s assistant was not notice of entry of judgment; the very language of the letter indicated that the order had not yet been filed.Â  Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in dismissing the appeal as untimely. \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Support\r\nWife contends that the family court erred in awarding child support without a showing of dramatically changed financial situation or changed circumstances.Â  We agree.\r\nIn order to determine the proper standard, we must first determine if this is 1) an action to establish an order of child support or 2) an action to modify an order of child support.Â  \r\nGenerally, a petition is treated as an action to establish child support if the issue was not addressed previously in the separation agreement or the divorce decree.Â  McElrath v. Walker, 285 S.C. 439, 440, 330 S.E.2d 313, 313 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  However, when the divorce decree or separation agreement addresses the issue of child support, the petition is considered one for modification. Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 310-11, 384 S.E.2d 715, 716-17 (1989) (reviewing the denial of a petition to decrease child support set by the divorce decree using the modification standard of changed circumstances). Â Additionally, it is possible for the issue of child support to be held in abeyance by the divorce decree or incorporated separation agreement.Â  Boyer v. Boyer 291 S.C. 183, 184-85, 352 S.E.2d 514, 515-16 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding that the court could award child support without a showing of changed circumstances where the original divorce decree awarded child support to be set after a specified time upon petition to the court). Â Â Nevertheless, an agreement between the parents may not affect the basic support rights of minor children.Â  Lunsford v. Lunsford, 277 S.C. 104, 105, 282 S.E.2d 861, 862 (1981).Â  Notwithstanding any provisions of a separation agreement, the family court retains jurisdiction to do whatever is in the best interest of the children.Â  Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 351, 306 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1983).Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe hold that the petition in the instant case was one for modification of child support.Â  The separation agreement, which was incorporated into the divorce decree, specifically addresses the issue of child support.Â  Furthermore, there is no indication in the separation agreement or the divorce decree that the issue of child support would be held in abeyance.Â  Therefore, any subsequent review of the issue by the family court would be for modification.Â  \r\nThe separation agreement, in the instant case, provided that the parties may â€œrevisit the issue of child support should the financial situation of either party change dramatically.â€Â  This language essentially mirrors the courtâ€™s own changed circumstances standard for modification of child support obligations.Â  Therefore, the courtâ€™s application of the changed circumstances standard encompasses the standard agreed on by the parties. Accordingly, we do not need to determine if parties may change the standard for modification of a child support award by agreement.Â  Therefore, applying the standard of changed circumstances, we find that Husband did not provide sufficient evidence to warrant a modification of the original decree. \r\nA child support award rests in the discretion of the trial judge, and will not be altered on appeal absent abuse of discretion.Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 197, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  However, in reviewing an appeal from the family court, the appellate court may find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).\r\nThe family court may always modify child support upon a proper showing of a change in either the childâ€™s needs or the supporting parentâ€™s financial ability.Â  Moseley, 279 S.C. at 351, 306 S.E.2d at 626.Â Â  The party seeking the modification has the burden to show changed circumstances.Â  Miller, 299 S.C. at 310, 384 S.E.2d at 716. Â This burden is increased where the child support award is based on a settlement agreement.Â  Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 74, 587 S.E.2d 118, 120 (Ct. App. 2003). However, changes within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the initial decree are not sufficient bases for the modification of a child support award.Â  Miller, 299 S.C. at 310, 384 S.E.2d at 717.Â  Further, general testimony regarding increased expenses, without specific evidentiary support, is an insufficient showing of changed circumstances.Â  Thornton v. Thornton, 294 S.C. 512, 516, 366 S.E.2d 37, 39 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nHusband testified generally about changed circumstances, but provided few concrete figures to support his claim.Â  Husband also relied on expenses such as orthodontic bills and private school tuition which were likely anticipated at the time of the separation agreement and divorce decree.[3]Â  This testimony alone does not provide sufficient proof of a change in the childrenâ€™s needs or circumstances to modify the previous child support order. \r\nAdditionally, Wife did not submit a financial declaration in the initial divorce proceeding.Â  Therefore, in the present case, the family court faced further challenges in determining if Wifeâ€™s current financial situation differed from her situation at the time of the divorce.Â  Evidence was presented to show that Wife no longer had a house in Charleston as outlined in the divorce decree, but no further evidence of changed circumstances appears in the record.Â  \r\nAccordingly, this Court finds that Husband failed to prove changed circumstances and the record is insufficient to justify the modification of the child support award.Â  Therefore, the family courtâ€™s order awarding child support to Husband is reversed.Â Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of Changed Circumstances\r\nWife asserts that the family court erred in allowing the presentation of evidence regarding changed circumstances not pled in the Husbandâ€™s complaint.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.â€Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP; McCurry v. Keith, 325 S.C. 441 ,447, 481 S.E.2d 166, 169 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  If a party does not object to the evidence when presented at trial, the issue is considered tried by consent.Â  Simmons v. Tuomey Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 330 S.C. 115, 120 n.2, 498 S.E.2d Â 408, 410 n.2 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nWife consented to the presentation of the evidence regarding changed circumstances because she only objected to the testimony regarding college expenses for the oldest child.Â  Wife did not object to any other testimony presented at trial.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s admission of testimony regarding changed circumstances.\r\nIV.&nbsp;Retroactive Child Support\r\nWife contends that the family court erred in awarding child support retroactive to the filing of the petition for support.Â  We agree.\r\nThe award of retroactive child support is incident to the award of general child support.Â  Because we reverse the family courtâ€™s award of child support, the award of retroactive child support does not need to be addressed.Â  \r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife contends that the family court erred in denying her claim for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2004) authorizes the family court to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The award of attorneyâ€™s fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will only be disturbed upon a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Ariail v. Ariail, 295 S.C. 486, 489, 369 S.E.2d 146, 148 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In making this determination, the court should evaluate the requesting partyâ€™s ability to pay, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, the effect of the award on each partyâ€™s standard of living, and the beneficial results achieved.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  Beneficial result alone is not dispositive of whether a party is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203,214, 532 S.E.2d 890, 894 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nThe family court did not make any specific findings as to the reasons for denial of the request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Further, in light of the evidence in the record, we cannot conclude that either party is in a position to pay the otherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wifeâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision dismissing Wifeâ€™s appeal as untimely.Â  We also reverse the family courtâ€™s modification of child support and the award of retroactive child support.Â  Finally, we affirm the admission of testimony regarding changed circumstances and the denial of wifeâ€™s claim for attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1] Rule 12(a), SCRCP, provides that â€œif the Court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits, the responsive pleading shall be served within 15 days after notice of the Court's actionâ€¦â€ (emphasis added).\r\n[2] Rule 77(d), SCRCP states that â€œimmediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice of the entry by first class mail upon every party affected thereby who is not in default for failure to appear, and shall make a note in the case file or docket sheet of the mailing. Such mailing shall not be necessary to parties who have already received notice. Such mailing is sufficient notice for all purposes for which notice of the entry of an order or judgment is required by these rules; but any party may in addition serve a notice of entry on any other party in the manner provided in Rule 5 for the service of such papers.â€ \r\n[3] Husband filed the petition for child support just eight months after the order of divorce.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26091","title":"Ellenburg v.

Newton, all of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nTara Dawn Shurling, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  This case is before us on a writ of certiorari to review the lower courtâ€™s order granting post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was convicted of safecracking, second degree burglary, and petit larceny for robbing a Subway Sandwich Shop where he was formerly employed.Â  The robbery occurred on April 29, 1997, after the store closed and the last employee had left at 1:15 a.m.Â  The store alarm set automatically at 2:00 a.m. and there was no sign of a break-in.Â  The cash register indicated that it had been opened at 1:44 a.m.Â  More than $400 was taken from the cash register, another $250 was taken from a file cabinet, and the dial on the storeâ€™s safe was destroyed.Â  \r\nThe store manager testified that all employees knew the code for the cash register, and employees who worked the closing shift, including respondent, knew the alarm set automatically at 2:00 a.m.\r\nThe only evidence linking respondent to the crime was the testimony of Jeremy Littleton.Â  Littleton testified he planned the robbery with respondent and another man.Â  Littleton, who was an employee at the time and had a key, unlocked the back door and waited while the other two went in and robbed the store.Â  The three of them split the money.\r\nDuring direct examination by the solicitor, Littleton testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.Â  How did you come about to get arrested?\r\n          &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         I was sent to go do a polygraph test for everyone who had a key, and I gave Sergeant Moss my oral statement about what had went on and how I was involved.\r\n          &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         How did you feel about -----\r\n          &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         I knew it was wrong.Â  I felt my conscience had made me do what I had done.Â  It made me come out and tell them what I had done.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCounsel moved for a mistrial based on Littletonâ€™s reference to a polygraph.Â  The motion was denied. \r\nIn closing, counsel attempted to undermine Littletonâ€™s testimony:\r\n\r\nBut what did Jeremy testify to?Â  He said, Yes.Â  When I first went up to the law enforcement folks I denied that I was involved, and then the reason that he changed his story, they were getting ready to put him on a lie detector.Â  So he changes his story and says he was involved and doesnâ€™t have to take a lie detector. . . .\r\nHeâ€™s getting ready to go see Sergeant Moss, and heâ€™s been denying that heâ€™s been involved in this crime.Â  Then theyâ€™re getting ready to put him on a lie detector, and what does he do?Â  He says, Let me tell you what happened.Â  Does he tell them the truth?Â  No.Â  He doesnâ€™t tell them the truth.Â  He gives them partial truth.Â  He admits part of it, but what doesnâ€™t he do?Â  He never puts himself inside the building.\r\n\r\nIn response, the solicitor argued:\r\n\r\nWhy would he (Jeremy Littleton) lie?Â  How was he being helped by making up this story?Â  He has no deal with me.Â  He is charged with the exact same crimes as the other two defendants.Â  He came up here, got on this stand, swore on the Bible, put his hands behind his back and stuck his chin out, and said, Solicitor, take your best shot at me. . . . Never mind that he had no deal with me, ladies and gentlemen, he had no deal with [Sergeant] Moss when he went in and talked to him.Â  When he came in, knowing that he was going to be put on the polygraph and confess because he knew that polygraph would catch him lying.\r\n\r\nAfter respondentâ€™s conviction was affirmed on appeal, he commenced this PCR action.Â  The PCR judge found counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument regarding the polygraph. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas counsel ineffective for failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s closing? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFirst, the mere mention of a polygraph during testimony is not prejudicial where, as here, no results are introduced into evidence.Â  Bruno v. State, 347 S.C. 446, 556 S.E.2d 393 (2001).Â  Further, counsel testified he mentioned the polygraph during closing to give the jury an explanation that would exonerate his client i.e., Littleton told a â€œpartial truthâ€ to avoid having to take a polygraph, which would have revealed that he committed the robbery himself.Â  Counselâ€™s strategy was a reasonable way to cast doubt on Littletonâ€™s testimony implicating respondent.Â  Stokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546, 419 S.E.2d 778 (1992) (where counsel articulates valid reasons for employing certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel).Â Â  \r\nWe find the solicitorâ€™s argument was in fair response to counselâ€™s argument regarding the polygraph.Â  Once the defendant opens the door, the solicitorâ€™s invited response is appropriate so long as it is does not unfairly prejudice the defendant.Â  Cf. Vaughn v. State, 362 S.C. 163, 607 S.E.2d 72 (2004) (solicitorâ€™s comments not proper under invited response doctrine where there was no evidence to support them).Â  Since the evidence was that Littleton did not actually take the polygraph, it was arguable that either he told only a partial truth, as counsel argued, or he told the whole truth, implicating respondent as the solicitor argued.Â  Accordingly, the solicitorâ€™s argument was not unfair and counsel was not ineffective for failing to object.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSince the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling finding counsel ineffective is not supported by the evidence, the order granting relief Â is reversed.Â  See Bright v.

Kelly, of Summerville, for the guardian ad litem for Trae Steven\r\nMonceaux.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This appeal raises the issue of whether the family court judge erred in a child custody case by issuing a permanency planning order without allowing the presentation of testimony and evidence at a hearing.Â  We affirm in result.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nTrae Steven Monceaux (Child) was born in 2001 and abandoned by his mother, who left him with a friend, Amelia Beth Morris (Custodian).Â  The motherâ€™s present whereabouts and the fatherâ€™s identity are unknown.Â  Custodian is not related by blood or marriage to Child.Â  Custodian apparently filed an action at an unspecified time to adopt Child, but did not pursue the action. \r\nThe state Department of Social Services in Berkeley County (DSS) took Child into emergency protective custody in May 2003 pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-610 (Supp. 2004). Â DSS in a removal complaint filed pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736 (Supp. 2004) alleged that Child, then two years old, was harmed or threatened with harm because Custodian physically neglected him.Â  A family court judge ruled probable cause existed to remove Child from the home and ordered DSS retain custody of Child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-610(M) (Supp. 2004).\r\nA two-day hearing on the merits of the removal action was held in July 2003.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736(E) (Supp. 2004). Â A family court judge ruled that â€œremoval is justified in this case based upon a threat of physical harm to the child because of the instability of the home maintained by [Custodian],â€ and ordered DSS continue to retain custody of Child (emphasis in original).Â  The judge further ordered a treatment and placement plan pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-762 (Supp. 2004) in which Custodian was required to undergo assessments for mental health, anger management, alcohol and drug use, and financial matters, and follow all recommendations for counseling.Â  Custodian was required to take a parenting skills course, and maintain a safe and stable home and suitable employment.Â  \r\nAn initial permanency planning hearing was held in May 2004 pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-766 (Supp. 2004).Â  DSSâ€™s attorney explained the status and history of the case to the court, repeating the allegations of physical neglect and describing testimony and evidence presented at the removal hearing.Â  DSSâ€™s attorney briefly described alleged evidence in the case, including Custodianâ€™s purported use of illegal drugs and noncompliance with the treatment and placement plan, and Childâ€™s current placement with foster parents who wish to adopt him.Â  DSSâ€™s attorney asked the court to dismiss Custodian from the case and allow an action to terminate the rights of Childâ€™s parents to proceed so that Child may be adopted.\r\nThe DSS case managerâ€™s affidavit and written case evaluation supporting the agencyâ€™s position apparently were submitted to the court.Â  A report from the area Childrenâ€™s Foster Care Review Board which supported DSSâ€™s conclusions and recommendations apparently was submitted to the court.[1]  \r\nCustodianâ€™s attorney stated that Custodian contested DSSâ€™s position and requested an evidentiary hearing to respond to the agencyâ€™s inaccurate and distorted description of her case. Â Custodianâ€™s attorney briefly described facts and evidence supporting Custodianâ€™s effort to regain custody of Child, including the fact she had recently begun complying with the treatment and placement plan, and had obtained an apartment and stable job.\r\nCounsel for the GAL told the judge the GAL concurred with DSSâ€™s position and recommendations, and briefly described facts and evidence supporting DSSâ€™s position.\r\nNo party or witnesses offered live, sworn testimony at the hearing.Â  After listening to the attorneysâ€™ presentations, the family court judge rejected Custodianâ€™s request for an evidentiary hearing and ruled from the bench in favor of DSS.Â  The judge in a subsequent written order ruled Custodian lacked standing to participate in the case because she had failed to comply with the treatment and placement plan, and dismissed her from the case.Â  The judge directed DSS to initiate an action for termination of the rights of Childâ€™s parents so that he may be adopted. \r\nCustodian appealed.Â  We certified this case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the family court judge err in basing her decision in a permanency planning order on the arguments of counsel, the GALâ€™s report, and an examination of the case file and pleadings, but without considering testimony and evidence at a hearing where witnesses are subject to direct and cross-examination?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp;\r\nRutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981). Â This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of a minor child.Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34 (2004); Dixon v. Dixon, 336 S.C. 260, 263, 519 S.E.2d 357, 359 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Moreover, the appellate courtâ€™s broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of the burden of showing that the family court committed error.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 523, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nAs an initial matter, we take this opportunity to clarify the issue of Custodianâ€™s standing in this matter.Â  The family court judge ruled Custodian had no standing to participate in the proceeding because she had failed to rehabilitate herself and complete the treatment and placement plan.Â  DSS in its brief repeatedly mentions that Custodian is not related to Child by blood or marriage, as if that fact alone somehow negates any standing or right to appear before the family court and assert which plan is best for Child.\r\nAs a general rule, to have standing, a litigant must have a personal stake in the subject matter of the litigation.Â  Glaze v. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, 255, 478 S.E.2d 841, 845 (1996).Â  One must be a real party in interest, i.e., a party who has a real, material, or substantial interest in the subject matter of the action, as opposed to one who has only a nominal or technical interest in the action.Â  Id.; Charleston County School Dist. v. Charleston County Elec. Commn., 336 S.C. 174, 181, 519 S.E.2d 567, 571 (1999).Â  \r\nWhile Custodian may not stand on precisely the same footing as a parent or close relative, it is apparent from a reading of various statutes touching on the issue that the Legislature contemplated nonrelatives often may play a crucial and important role in the life and well-being of a child, particularly when parents or relatives turn away from the child.Â  See e.g. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490(3) (Supp. 2004) (defining â€œa person responsible for a childâ€™s welfareâ€ to include a parent, guardian, foster parent, caregiver, â€œor an adult who has assumed the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian for the child, but who does not necessarily have legal custody of the childâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-766(G) (Supp. 2004) (family court at the permanency planning stage for a child removed from his home may award custody or legal guardianship to a â€œsuitable, fit, and willing relative or nonrelativeâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-766(K) (Supp. 2004) (â€œAny other party in interest may move to intervene in the case pursuant to the rules of civil procedure and if the motion is granted, may move for review.Â  Parties in interest include, but are not limited to, the individual or agency with legal custody or placement of the child and the foster parent.â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-610 (Supp. 2004) (emergency protective custody statute which repeatedly uses the terms â€œother personâ€ or â€œcustodianâ€ in addition to â€œparentâ€ or â€œguardianâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-435 (1985) (listing â€œcustodianâ€ among persons who may institute proceedings regarding a neglected or delinquent child); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-480 (Supp. 2004) (expressing legislative philosophy that, while parents have primary responsibility for their children, the welfare of neglected or abused children is a concern of the entire community); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-50 and -70 (Supp. 2004) (establishing criminal penalties for any person who â€œhas charge or custody of a childâ€ or who â€œis responsible for the welfare of a childâ€ and is convicted of committing certain unlawful conduct towards a child).Â  \r\nA nonrelative such as Custodian who has a real, material, or substantial interest in the long-term custody and potential adoption of a child has standing to participate in a family court proceeding addressing those issues.Â  Accordingly, we reject the notion Custodian somehow lacks standing to appear in this case or argue on behalf of Child simply because she is not related to Child by blood or marriage, or because she failed to comply with a treatment and placement plan.[2]Â  \r\nTurning to the issue of an evidentiary hearing, Custodian argues the family court is required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-766(C) (Supp. 2004) to find compelling reasons for approval of a permanency plan which does not involve reunification of the child with the parent or custody or guardianship with a fit and willing relative.Â  Custodian contends an appropriate decision in the important matters of long-term custody and potential adoption may not be reached when the family court considers only the arguments of counsel and a GALâ€™s report, but refuses to consider testimony and evidence at a hearing where parties and witnesses are subject to direct and cross-examination.Â  We agree.\r\nIt is error, in the face of a request by a party for an evidentiary hearing, for the family court to issue a permanency planning order based on an examination of the file and pleadings, the arguments of counsel, and the GALâ€™s report, but without considering testimony and evidence at a hearing where witnesses are subject to direct and cross-examination.\r\nIt is well established that counselâ€™s statements regarding the facts of a case and counselâ€™s arguments are not admissible evidence.Â  E.g. McManus v. Bank of Greenwood, 171 S.C. 84, 89, 171 S.E. 473, 475 (1933) (appellate courts repeatedly have held â€œthat statements of fact appearing only in arguments of counsel will not be consideredâ€); S.C. Dept. of Transp. v. Thompson, 357 S.C. 101, 105, 590 S.E.2d 511, 513 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œ[a]rguments made by counsel are not evidenceâ€).Â  Consequently, the family court may not base necessary findings of fact and conclusions of law solely on counselâ€™s statements of fact or arguments.Â  See Section 20-7-766(A) (requiring family court to make specific findings in a permanency planning order). Â \r\nIn addition, written affidavits and reports generally constitute inadmissible hearsay, with some exceptions, although they may become admissible in whole or part when a proper foundation is laid by a witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  See Rules 801-804, SCRE; Rule 7, SCRFC.Â  The family court properly may review and rely on previous orders and pleadings contained in a particular case in resolving the issues at hand, but should not rely solely on these documents in issuing a permanency planning order.\r\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, it is apparent from a plain reading of Section 20-7-766 that the Legislature intended the family court hold an evidentiary hearing before issuing a permanency planning order when a hearing is necessitated by the facts of a case, the material facts are contested by the parties, or a hearing is requested by a party.Â  The Legislature repeatedly used the term â€œhearingâ€ throughout the statute, indicating a proceeding at which parties are allowed to present evidence and sworn testimony bearing on issues before the family court.Â  Furthermore, the permanency planning process set forth in Section 20-7-766 and related statutes involves the long-term custody of a child, the potential termination of parental rights, and the possible adoption of the child in the future.Â  Decisions regarding matters of such import must be made after careful, deliberate consideration of admissible evidence and sworn testimony presented by interested parties and witnesses at an evidentiary hearing.\r\nAlthough the family court judge erred in rejecting Custodianâ€™s request for an evidentiary hearing, we affirm the result in this case.Â  The family court judge ordered, among other things, that Custodian â€œis dismissed as a party to this action.â€Â  Custodian has appealed only the issue of whether an evidentiary hearing was required, not her dismissal from the case.Â  This unappealed ruling is the law of the case and requires affirmance.Â  See e.g. Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance); Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 177 S.E.2d 544 (1970) (same); Rule 220(c), SCACR (appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record). Â Accordingly, we affirm.Â  We decline to exercise our discretion to avoid application of the procedural bar.Â  See Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000) (â€œprocedural rules are subservient to the courtâ€™s duty to zealously guard the rights of minorsâ€); Ex parte Roper, 254 S.C. 558, 563, 176 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1970) (duty to protect rights of minors has precedence over procedural rules otherwise limiting the scope of review and matters affecting the rights of minors may be considered by an appellate court for the first time on appeal or even on its own motion); Galloway v. Galloway, 249 S.C. 157, 160, 153 S.E.2d 326, 327 (1967) (same).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIt is error, in the face of a request by a party for an evidentiary hearing, for the family court to issue a permanency planning order based on an examination of the file and pleadings, the arguments of counsel, and the GALâ€™s report, but without considering testimony and evidence at a hearing where witnesses are subject to direct and cross-examination.Â  Although we find error, we affirm the order of the family court because Custodian failed to appeal the ruling which dismissed her from the case.\r\n AFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and MOORE, J., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  None of the attorneys moved to submit any written documents into evidence during their descriptions of the case, although they mentioned some documents.Â  No party has objected to inclusion of the documents in the record on appeal.Â  See Rule 210(c), SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The family court judge properly may reject a temporary custodianâ€™s effort to obtain or retain custody of a child due to the custodianâ€™s failure to comply with a treatment and placement plan, but the custodian retains standing to challenge that decision in the family court and on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26093","title":"State v.

Carrigg, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Alicia Jeanette Haase, was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in municipal court in Greenwood County.Â  On appeal, the circuit court reversed her conviction, holding the state had failed to comply with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2934 (Supp. 2004) at the time of her arrest.Â  We reverse and reinstate the conviction.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHaaseâ€™s vehicle was observed speeding and jumping a curb at 3:00 a.m. on September 28, 2001, in Greenwood.Â  Nearby police heard her car jump the curb and proceeded to the parking lot where Haaseâ€™s vehicle had stopped.Â  Â Haase smelled of alcohol, had slurred speech, and was unsteady on her feet.Â  After failing several sobriety tests, she was arrested for DUI and taken to the detention center for a Data Master test.Â  Haase was read her Miranda[2] rights and given Implied Consent warnings,[3] but refused the Data Master test.Â  \r\nHaase was tried in municipal court in January 2004.Â  She moved to exclude evidence of her refusal to take the Data Master test, claiming the arresting officer failed to comply with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2934.Â  The motion was denied, and the jury convicted Haase of DUI.Â  Haase appealed, and the circuit court ruled the stateâ€™s failure to comply with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2934 required exclusion of all evidence against Haase which arose after her arrest, thereby requiring reversal of her conviction.[4] Â Â \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err in reversing Haaseâ€™s conviction due to the failure to follow the procedures mandated by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2934? \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2934, which became effective March 1, 2002, is entitled â€œRight to Compulsory Process,â€ and provides for the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses and documents.Â  In addition, Â§ 56-5-2934 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIn addition, at the time of arrest for a violation of Section 56-5-2930, 56-5-2933, or 56-5-2945, the arresting officer, in addition to other notice requirements, must inform the defendant of his right to all hearings provided by law to include those if a breath test is refused or taken with a result that would require license suspension. The arresting officer, if the defendant wishes to avail himself of any such hearings, depending on the choices made or the breath test results obtained, must provide the defendant with the appropriate form to request the hearing or hearings. The defendant must acknowledge receipt of the notice requirements and receipt of the hearing form if such a hearing or hearings are desired.\r\n\r\n2000 Act No. 390, Â§ 9, (emphasis supplied).Â  This section became effective March 1, 2002.Â  However, Section 34 of Act 390 made Â§ 56-5-2934 applicable to all pending cases that have not been adjudicated on that date.Â Â  Although Haase was arrested six months prior to the effective date of Â§ 56-5-2934, her case was not adjudicated until January 2004, such that it was pending on March 1, 2002.Â  \r\nThe circuit court ruled the state was required to comply with Â§ 56-5-2934 and, finding the state failed to do so, the court held all evidence against Haase which arose or was collected at or after her arrest must be excluded; accordingly, her conviction was reversed.Â  This was error.Â  We find Haase was adequately advised pursuant to Â§ 56-5-2934.\r\nHaase was given Implied Consent warnings while at the Data Master site, prior to refusing the test.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (a) (the Implied Consent statute), these warnings would have advised Haase that her license would be suspended if she refused the test, and that she had the right to request an administrative hearing.Â  The purpose of the warnings under Â§ 56-5-2934 are to advise the defendant of the consequences of refusing or failing the breathalyzer, i.e., license suspension, and to advise the defendant of the right to a hearing concerning a suspension and provide the necessary forms to request such a hearing.Â  \r\nHaase makes no claim that the warnings given were inadequate or improper.Â  Rather, she contends only that the failure to give the warnings at the arrest site mandates exclusion of all post-arrest evidence of her intoxication.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn State v. Dowd, 306 S.C. 268, 269, 411 S.E.2d 428, 429 (1991), we held that â€œ[a]n arrest does not necessarily terminate the instant a person is taken into custody; arrest also includes bringing the person personally within the custody and control of the law.â€Â  We find police, by giving Haase warnings prior to her refusal of the Data Master test, sufficiently complied with the requirements of Â§ 56-5-2934.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court erred in reversing Haaseâ€™s conviction.Â  The judgment below is reversed.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Ernst Kinard, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We certified this case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[3] Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (a).\r\n[4] Â This evidence includes all statements made by Haase after her arrest, all observations by police officers made after the arrest, and the videotape made in preparation for administration of the Data Master test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26094","title":"State v.

Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  John Roosevelt Baccus (Appellant) was convicted of murder and burglary in the first degree in connection with the shooting death of Brenda Kay Godbolt (victim), his former girlfriend.Â  Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole on the murder charge and life imprisonment for the burglary charge, to be served concurrently.Â  We certified his appeal from the Court of Appeals, pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn November 14, 1999, the victim and her four-year old son were at her residence in Marion County.Â  Victim and her friend, Priscilla Ham, talked at length during two telephone conversations.Â  During the second conversation the victim began screaming.Â  Ham testified the victim screamed, â€œJohn was here.â€Â  Ham further testified she heard Appellant say, â€œIâ€™m gonna kill your ass.â€Â  She then heard a pop and clicking sound.Â  Ham reported the incident to 911.Â  \r\nAt trial, Dr. Erin Presnell, an expert in forensic pathology, testified the victim received two gunshot wounds to her body, one on her left cheek and one on her neck.Â  Death resulted from the gunshot wound to the cheek.Â  \r\nAt a pretrial suppression hearing and at trial, Officer Von Turbeville testified he arrived on the scene in the early morning hours of November 15, 1999, where he met with other officers and called Ham.Â  Ham relayed to Turbeville her phone conversation with the victim and what she had overheard.Â  Ham told him the victim said Appellant was coming through the window.Â  She also gave him Appellantâ€™s name, his address in Florence County, and the type of car he had been driving.Â  Turbeville relayed this information to Officer Barry Prosser of the Florence County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  \r\nProsser testified at trial and at the suppression hearing that he went to Appellantâ€™s residence, where he knocked on the door but received no response.Â  Prosser observed a car parked at a convenience store about one-fourth of a mile from Appellantâ€™s house that matched the description of the car Appellant had been driving.Â  He noticed a â€œred substanceâ€ on the car and inside it.Â  He also observed a smoldering burn pile containing clothing and shoes in Appellantâ€™s back yard.Â  He testified he knocked on the door again and Appellant answered.Â  Prosser advised Appellant he was investigating an incident in Marion County, and Appellant was arrested.Â  \r\nAt the pretrial suppression hearing, Turbeville testified he gave Officer Amber McDaniel of the Florence County Sheriffâ€™s Department information to obtain a search warrant for Appellantâ€™s residence.Â  At a subsequent pretrial suppression hearing, McDaniel testified Turbeville told her about a homicide in Marion County; that Prosser had arrested Appellant, a suspect, in Florence County; that there was a burn pile with clothing outside Appellantâ€™s residence and that a vehicle Appellant was allegedly driving appeared to have blood stains in it.Â  \r\nMcDaniel completed an affidavit for a search warrant with the information Turbeville supplied.Â  She testified she did not know any particulars regarding the homicide at the time she requested a search warrant; specifically, she did not know why Appellant was a suspect.Â  Additionally, she told the magistrate she had received a phone call from Turbeville regarding a homicide and Appellant had been arrested.Â  She did not remember telling the magistrate anything not contained in the affidavit for the search warrant.Â  Upon executing the search warrant, clothing, shoes, and a key to a vehicle were seized from Appellantâ€™s residence.Â  \r\nPrior to trial, the State petitioned the circuit court and the court issued an order directing Appellant to provide a blood sample for testing and comparison purposes.Â  Blood was drawn from Appellant pursuant to the order.Â  \r\nThe State presented the testimony of Michelle Dixon, who was qualified as an expert in latent prints, blood spatter, and crime scene reconstruction.Â  During her initial walk-through of the victimâ€™s house, Dixon testified she found the victim in the rear bedroom where a window had been broken.Â  She observed bloody footwear impressions from the bedroom to the side door of the residence.Â  She testified during the process of entering the window the suspect was cut.Â  She also testified fingerprints found in the window sill matched Appellantâ€™s fingerprints.Â  \r\nJohn Black testified as an expert in crime scene analysis, fingerprints, blood, and footwear impressions.Â  He testified the shoes seized from Appellantâ€™s house matched the bloody shoeprints in the victimâ€™s house.\r\nDr. Steve Lambert testified at trial as an expert in DNA and serological analysis.Â  Lambert testified he compared Appellantâ€™s blood, drawn pursuant to a court order, with evidence found in the victimâ€™s home.Â  Lambert testified DNA testing and blood comparison revealed Appellantâ€™s blood matched blood found on the kitchen door, a bed sheet, and a blind in the bedroom where the victim was found.Â  He also testified that on the night of Appellantâ€™s arrest a blood swab was taken from a cut on Appellantâ€™s left palm.Â  The blood from that swabbing also matched the blood on the door, sheet, and blind. Â \r\nDuring the suppression hearing and again during trial, Appellant moved to suppress evidence on the following grounds: (1) any evidence obtained by the State as a result of Appellantâ€™s warrantless arrest because the arresting officer lacked probable cause; (2) any evidence obtained by the search warrant because the affidavit accompanying the search warrant lacked probable cause; and (3) blood evidence drawn pursuant to a court order and implicating Appellant in the crime because the bodily intrusion was an unlawful search and seizure.Â  The trial judge denied the motions.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in admitting evidence emanating from Appellantâ€™s arrest because the police officer did not have probable cause to arrest him?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in admitting evidence seized from Appellantâ€™s residence because the police affidavit which accompanied the search warrant did not support a finding of probable cause?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in refusing to suppress blood evidence implicating Appellant in the crimes which was obtained in violation of his constitutional and statutory rights?Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s factual findings on whether evidence should be suppressed due to a Fourth Amendment violation are reviewed for clear error.Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 665-66 (2000) (a private search is a question of fact and the trial courtâ€™s ruling will be reversed only if there is clear error). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Arrest\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by refusing to suppress evidence seized emanating from his arrest.Â  Appellant contends his arrest was illegal because officers arrested him without a warrant and without probable cause.Â  Appellant argues his fingerprints and blood, which were taken at the jail after his allegedly illegal arrest, should be suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree. Â See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407 (1963).Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe fundamental question in determining the lawfulness of an arrest is whether probable cause existed to make the arrest.Â  Probable cause for a warrantless arrest exists when the circumstances within the arresting officerâ€™s knowledge are sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed by the person being arrested. Â State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 509, 476 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1996) (finding probable cause for warrantless arrest for murder).Â  Whether probable cause exists depends upon the totality of the circumstances surrounding the information at the officerâ€™s disposal. Â Id.; see also Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225 (1964) (a court must consider â€œwhether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make it&#8209;&#8209;whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the [Appellant] had committed. . .an offense.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe conclude Prosser had probable cause to make the warrantless arrest based on the information he received from Turbeville and his own observations at Appellantâ€™s residence.Â  Turbeville testified he relayed to Prosser information he received from Ham.Â  Prosser testified Turbeville informed him of a homicide and information related to that homicide.Â  He knew Appellant was a suspect in the homicide.Â  He also observed a red substance on the inside and outside of a car matching the description of the car Appellant had been driving.Â  He saw a burn pile containing shoes and clothing in Appellantâ€™s backyard.Â  The trial judge properly admitted evidence emanating from Appellantâ€™s warrantless arrest.Â  \r\nII. Search Warrant\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by refusing to suppress evidence seized from his residence pursuant to a search warrant.Â  Appellant contends the search warrant was not supported by probable cause, and the shoes, clothing, and key seized should have been excluded from trial.[1]Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\nA search warrant may issue only upon a finding of probable cause. State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1999). The duty of the reviewing court is to ensure the issuing magistrate had a substantial basis upon which to conclude that probable cause existed.Â  State v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 352 S.E.2d 483 (1987).Â  In Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332 (1983), the United States Supreme Court adopted a â€œtotality-of-the-circumstancesâ€ test for probable cause determinations:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical,\r\ncommon-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the â€œveracityâ€ and\r\nâ€œbasis of knowledgeâ€ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime\r\nwill be found in a particular place.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, search warrants may be issued â€œonly upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate. . .establishing the grounds for the warrant.â€Â  S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003); see also State v. McKnight, 291 S.C.110, 352 S.E.2d 471 (1987). The affidavit must set forth particular facts and circumstances underlying the existence of probable cause to allow the magistrate to make an independent evaluation of the matter.Â  Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674 (1978). Â \r\nIn State v. Smith, 301 S.C. 371, 392 S.E.2d 182 (1990), Smith moved to suppress a knife, allegedly used in a robbery, which was seized from his motel room pursuant to a search warrant.Â  In determining whether the issuing magistrate had a substantial basis to conclude probable cause existed, this Court considered the following affidavit accompanying a search warrant:\r\n\r\nThat on May 12th at approximately 11:45 p.m. Reginald Jerome\r\nSmith went into the Master Inn located at 1468 Savannah Hwy., Charleston, S.C. and he then robbed the manager at knife point.\r\nSmith has been staying at the Host of America Room 216 since Jan. 1, 1988 and there is every reason to believe the weapon and\r\nclothes used in the robbery will be located in the room. This information was confirmed in person by Sgt. Sherman on\r\n05/13/88. \r\n\r\nId. at 372, 392 S.E.2d at 183.Â  We held that the affidavit was defective because it â€œset[] forth no facts as to why police believed Smith robbed the Master Host Inn.â€Â  Id. at 373, 392 S.E.2d at 183. We further found, â€œMere conclusory statements which give the magistrate no basis to make a judgment regarding probable cause are insufficient.â€Â  Id.Â  See also State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997) (an affidavit supporting a search warrant could not have provided a substantial basis for finding probable cause to search Westonâ€™s car when the affidavit failed to set forth any facts as to why police believed Weston committed the crime and the first three sentences of the affidavit contained conclusory statements).Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, the affidavit in support of the search warrant for Appellantâ€™s residence read:\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY SOUGHT\r\n Any evidence such as: clothing, shoes, weapons, or forensics evidence such as blood.Â  Which maybe connected with the\r\nHomicide of Brenda K. Godbolt which occurred in Marion County. . . .\r\nREASON FOR AFFIANTâ€™S BELIEF THAT THE PROPERTY SOUGHT IS ON THE SUBJECT PREMISES\r\n At the time of the suspects (sic) arrest at 2616 Alligator Rd. in Florence County, by Investigators Barry Prosser and Von Dean\r\nTurbeville with Florence and Marion County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  A pile of what appeared to be clothing was lying on the ground\r\nbeside the residence smoldering in plain view, and a vehicle the suspect was apparently driving was located approximately Â¼ of a\r\nmile from this residence with blood stains on the inside and outside of the vehicle.Â \r\n\r\nThis affidavit fails to set forth any facts as to why police believed Appellant committed the crime.Â  The language in the affidavit lacks specifity and contains conclusory statements.Â  Given the totality of the circumstances, we conclude the issuing magistrate did not have a substantial basis to find probable cause for a search of Appellantâ€™s residence, and the trial court erred in admitting evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.Â  \r\nIII. Bodily Intrusion\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by refusing to suppress\r\nblood evidence implicating him in the crime.Â  Specifically, Appellant contends the court order compelling a blood sample violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140, and Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826 (1966).Â  We agree. \r\nAppellant argues the petition and order do not meet constitutional or statutory requirements because there was no sworn testimony, warrant, or affidavit showing probable cause that a search of Appellantâ€™s body would produce admissible evidence.Â  The State asserts Appellant consented to have his blood drawn and tested by filing a motion to compel evidence under a previously filed Brady[2] motion. The State further contends if the search is deemed nonconsensual, then the search was valid because the petition and order were the functional equivalent of a search warrant. \r\nThe Stateâ€™s assertion that Appellant consented to a search is without merit.Â  A defendant does not consent to a search and seizure by filing a Brady motion.Â  \r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  An order issued pursuant to Â§ 17-13-140 that allows the government to procure evidence from a personâ€™s body constitutes a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 767-70, 86 S.Ct. at 1834-35; State v. Register, 308 S.C. 534, 419 S.E.2d 771 (1992).Â  The Fourth Amendment protects against intrusions into the human body for the taking of evidence absent a warrant unless there are exigent circumstances, such as the imminent destruction of\r\nevidence Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. at 1835; see also State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 462 S.E.2d 279 (1995) (applying Schmerber analysis to search of suspectâ€™s mouth).Â  Where blood is needed only to determine blood type to match existing evidence, a warrant must be obtained even though there has been a lawful arrest.Â  Gantt v. State, 354 S.C. 183, 580 S.E.2d 133 (2003). \r\nA court order issued pursuant to Â§ 17-13-140 that allows the\r\ngovernment to procure evidence from a personâ€™s body must comply with constitutional and statutory guidelines.Â  Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 769-70, 86 S.Ct. at 1835; In re Snyder, 308 S.C. 192, 417 S.E.2d 572, (1992); Register, 308 S.C. at 537, 419 S.E.2d at 772.Â  In Snyder, we stated:Â \r\n\r\nSection 17-13-140 covers â€œthe issuance, execution and return of\r\nsearch warrants for property connected with the commission of crime. . .â€ Subsection (4) provides for the issuance of a searchwarrant for â€œproperty constituting evidence of crime or tending toshow that a particular person committed a criminal offense.â€Under this courtâ€™s construction, â€œpropertyâ€ as used in Section\r\n17-13-140, encompasses nontestimonial identification evidence.\r\n Respondents next assert that Section 17-13-140 contains no\r\nguidelines and procedures for obtaining nontestimonial identification evidence. However, guidelines and procedures for\r\nacquiring such evidence were promulgated in the case of In re: An Investigation into the Death of Abe A., 56 N.Y.2d 288, 452\r\nN.Y.S.2d 6, 7, 437 N.E.2d 265, 266 (1982). David M. v. Dwyer, 484 N.Y.S.2d 323, 107 A.D.2d 884 (1985) [citing Matter of Abe A., supra.] established considerations for determining whether or\r\nnot there exists probable cause to permit the acquisition of such evidence. These elements are: \r\n (1) probable cause to believe the suspect has committed the crime, \r\n (2) a clear indication that relevant material evidence will be found, and \r\n (3) the method used to secure it is safe and reliable.\r\n Additional factors to be weighed are the seriousness of the crime and the importance of the evidence to the investigation. The\r\njudge is required to balance the necessity for acquiring involuntary nontestimonial identification evidence against\r\nconstitutional safeguards prohibiting unreasonable bodily intrusions, searches, and seizures. Id.Â  . . .\r\nWe construe Section 17-13-140 to provide for the involuntary\r\nsubmission of nontestimonial identification evidence. Further, this Court holds that upon a sufficient showing of probable cause\r\nfor the issuance of an order, a court may order that such evidence be obtained from unarrested suspects within guidelines mandated\r\nunder the statutory provisions, case law, and Constitutional laws of this State and of the United States. Â \r\n\r\n308 S.C. at 195-96, 417 S.E.2d at 573-74; see also Register, 308 S.C. at 537-38, 419 S.E.2d at 773 (setting forth essentially the same considerations for a warrant or order compelling a bodily intrusion into a potential witness).\r\nThe facts of the present case are similar to Snyder and Register because the Fourth Amendment protections apply even when an individual has been arrested and indicted.Â  See Gantt, 354 S.C. at 187, 580 S.E.2d at 135 (â€œA lawful arrest does not in itself justify a warrantless search that requires bodily intrusion.â€). Therefore, a court order allowing the State to procure evidence from an arrested and indicted suspect must meet statutory and constitutional guidelines.Â  \r\nUnder both the United States and South Carolina constitutions, search warrants may not be issued except â€œupon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation.â€ U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â  Following these constitutional requirements, Â§ 17-13-140 requires a sworn affidavit for a search warrant to be issued.Â  A court order issued pursuant to Â§ 17-13-140, which stands in place of a search warrant, should only be issued upon a finding of probable cause, which is supported by oath or affirmation. [3]Â  Nothing in the record suggests the court order was issued upon a finding of probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.Â  Furthermore, exigent circumstances did not exist to justify a bodily intrusion without a warrant or order issued under Â§ 17-13-140.Â  Compare Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770-71, 86 S.Ct. at 1826 (exigent circumstances existed when testing for blood alcohol level, which is considered subject to imminent destruction).Â  We conclude the trial judge erred in refusing to suppress evidence of Appellantâ€™s blood because the order fails to comply with constitutional and statutory requirements.Â  See State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 69, 572 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2002) (â€œEvidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from trial.â€).Â  \r\nHaving found error, we must ask what other evidence was considered besides the evidence entered in error. State v. Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 433 S.E.2d 831 (1993); see also Rule 220(c), SCACR (on appeal this court may affirm on any ground contained in the record).Â  When guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached, this Court will not set aside a conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting the result. Â State v. Livingston, 282 S.C. 1, 317 S.E.2d 129 (1984).Â  \r\nThe State presented the testimony of Ham who overheard Appellant tell the victim he was going to kill her and who overheard a pop and clicking sound.Â  Additionally, the State presented evidence that Appellantâ€™s fingerprints matched fingerprints on the window sill of the broken window in the victimâ€™s bedroom.Â  Also, Dr. Lambert testified the blood sample collected from Appellant on the night of his arrest matched the blood found on the swabs and cuttings from the door, blind, and sheet in the victimâ€™s house.Â  Therefore, the blood evidence drawn pursuant to the court order which should have been excluded was cumulative. See State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003) (admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) (any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence is harmless).Â  After reviewing the entire record, we find the errors in admitting evidence from the search warrant and the court order were harmless.Â  SeeÂ  State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996) (â€œ[W]here a review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge properly admitted evidence emanating from Appellantâ€™s warrantless arrest.Â  However, the trial judge erred in admitting evidence seized from Appellantâ€™s residence pursuant to the search warrant and in admitting blood evidence drawn by court order.Â  However, we conclude these errors were harmless and we affirm Appellantâ€™s convictions.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Ernest Kinard, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  At trial, Appellant also argued the search warrant should be suppressed because the warrant predated the crime and the warrant did not have the exact date and time of issuance and return.Â  The trial judge denied the motion to suppress on this ground.Â  Appellant has abandoned this argument on appeal.Â  See State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 276 S.E.2d 163 (1981); Rule 208(b)(1)(B), (D), SCACR (issue not argued in brief is deemed abandoned and precludes consideration on appeal).\r\n[2]Â  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194 (1963).\r\n[3] Â Appellant argues a search warrant must also be issued, but in Snyder and Register we recognized a court order may be issued under Â§ 17-13-140 instead of a search warrant. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26095","title":"Dearybury v.

Â We remand for a hearing to determine whether Petitioner knowingly and voluntarily proceeded pro se at trial.\r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn August 1996, Petitioner and his wife were separated and had filed for divorce.Â  Petitioner retained an attorney to represent him in the divorce action.Â  Shortly thereafter, on September 10, 1996, Petitioner was arrested for CDV for an incident involving his wife.[1]Â  After being arrested, Petitioner testified, he called his divorce attorney from the city jail. Â Petitioner testified that his divorce attorney told him to plead not guilty and request a jury trial at the bond hearing, which he did.Â  \r\nHe testified that two days before a roll call, his divorce attorney told Petitioner that he would not be present.Â  Petitioner testified he appeared atÂ  the roll call and the trial judge asked him if he was ready to get started.Â Â  After Petitioner responded that he was, the trial began.Â  Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced.Â  Petitioner testified he did not object to going forward with the trial without counsel because he did not know what to say or do. \r\nPetitioner testified that afterwards he believed that his divorce attorney was taking steps to relieve him of the CDV conviction.Â  In December 2000, his divorce attorney withdrew as Petitionerâ€™s counsel in the divorce action.Â  In April 2001, Petitioner filed this action seeking relief from the CDV conviction.\r\nPetitionerâ€™s divorce attorney testified at the PCR hearing that he never represented Petitioner in the CDV case.Â  He testified he was handling only Petitionerâ€™s divorce action.Â  He testified he did not remember Petitioner calling him from jail or advisingÂ  Petitioner to plead not guilty and request a jury trial.Â  Petitionerâ€™s divorce attorney testified he received a faxed copy of a letter from the clerk of court which stated Petitioner had requested a jury trial.Â  Several months later, he testified, he received a notice of a hearing in the CDV case.Â  Â Petitionerâ€™s divorce attorney testified he called the city prosecutor and advised her that he represented Petitioner only in the divorce action.Â  However, he asked that the CDV be continued because he hoped for a settlement in the divorce action.Â  The city prosecutor agreed and the CDV case was continued.Â  \r\nSix months later, Petitionerâ€™s divorce attorney received a roster of cases from the city attorney indicating he represented Petitioner.Â  He testified he contacted Petitioner and advised him to obtain another attorney for the CDV case.Â  Petitionerâ€™s divorce attorney sent a letter to the city attorney advising that he was not representing Petitioner on the CDV charge.Â  He testified he did not discuss the matter any more with Petitioner until sometime in 2000.Â  \r\nThe PCR judge found Petitionerâ€™s divorce attorney was not Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel on the CDV offense and Petitioner was pro se at trial.Â  The PCR judge also found Petitionerâ€™s application for PCR was barred by the statute of limitations because Petitioner waited almost four years to file it.Â  The PCR judge additionally found that Petitioner was not entitledÂ  to a belated appeal pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974), because he held Petitioner was acting pro se and thus had waived any right to challenge the effectiveness of his counsel.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1)Â  Did the PCR judge err in finding Petitioner acted pro se and was not entitled to a belated appeal pursuant\r\nto White v. State? \r\n  2)Â  Did the PCR judge err in finding the statute of limitationsÂ barred Petitionerâ€™s PCR application? \r\n3) Did the trial court err in failing to sua sponte grant Petitioner a continuance?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Court will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative value to support them. Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 525 S.E.2d 514 (2000); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989). The Court will not uphold the findings when there is no probative evidence to support them. Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nLAW / ANALYSISÂ  \r\n1) Belated Appeal\r\nThe PCR judge found Petitioner was acting pro se below and his failure to file a direct appeal was due to his own inaction.[2]Â  Â He also found Petitionerâ€™s divorce attorney was not Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel.Â  Petitioner contends this was error.Â  \r\nWithout a doubt, Petitioner appeared pro se at his trial.Â  The term &quot;pro se&quot; is a term so familiar to lawyers that it hardly needs to be defined. Â It simply means to represent oneself. Â See Black's Law Dictionary 1237 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Clearly, Petitioner represented himself at trial and thus was acting pro se.Â  Further, there is plenty of evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that Petitionerâ€™s divorce attorney was not Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel on the CDV offense. Â Cherry v. State, supra. Â While the issue was not precisely raised by Petitioner in his PCR application, the threshold question in this case is not whether Petitioner proceeded pro se but whether he knowingly and voluntarily proceeded pro se.[3]Â  \r\nIt is well-established that a defendant may waive the right to counsel and proceed pro se. Â Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975). Â Although a defendant's decision to proceed pro se may be to the defendant's own detriment, it &quot;must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.&quot;Â  Id. at 834. Â The right to proceed pro se must be clearly asserted by the defendant prior to trial.Â  State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991). Â The trial judge has the responsibility to ensure that the accused is informed of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, and makes a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel. Â Faretta, supra.\r\nWhether Petitioner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel still needs to be determined.Â  If Petitioner did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel, he is presumably entitled to a belated direct appeal.[4]Â  Accordingly, this issue is remanded.\r\n2)Â  Statute of Limitations\r\nThe PCR judge found the statute of limitations barred Petitionerâ€™s PCR application.Â  Petitioner contends the PCR judge erred.Â  \r\nA PCR application ordinarily &quot;must be filed within one year after the entry of a judgment of conviction or within one year after the sending of the remittitur to the lower court from an appeal or the filing of the final decision upon an appeal, whichever is later.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27- 45(A) (2003).Â  Petitioner contends his PCR application is governed by subsection (C) of Â§ 17-27- 45 which provides for a one-year statute of limitations from the time of discovery of material facts not previously presented and heard that require vacation of the conviction.Â  Petitioner contends that it was not until March 2001 that he discovered that his divorce attorney did not represent him on the CDV offense and he filed for PCR within one month.[5]Â  Petitioner then argues that because he did not waive his right to appeal, the statute of limitations does not apply.\r\nAs noted above, we affirm the PCR courtâ€™s finding that Petitionerâ€™s divorce attorney was not Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel on the CDV offense.Â  However, because a defendant has the right to be informed of the right to an appeal, Wilson v. State, 348 S.C. 215, 559 S.E.2d 581 (2002), this issue also boils down to whether Petitioner voluntarily waived his right to counsel.Â  If Petitioner did not voluntarily or knowingly waive his right to counsel, his PCR application would not be barred by the statute of limitations and he presumably would be entitled to relief.\r\nThe State also contends Petitionerâ€™s PCR application is barred by laches.Â  However, laches is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded pursuant to Rule 8(c), SCRCP. Â See also Adams v. B &amp; D, Inc., 297 S.C. 416, 377 S.E.2d 315 (1989).Â  The State did not plead laches and accordingly is barred from asserting it now. \r\n3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuance\r\nPetitioner contends the trial judge should have sua sponte continued the case.Â  This is the direct appeal issue and because Petitioner was not granted a belated review, this issue is not properly before the Court at this time.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we remand for the PCR judge to determine whether Petitioner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to trial counsel.\r\nREMANDED.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1]The specific facts surrounding the CDV offense are not included in the record.\r\n[2]Petitioner argues the PCR judge erred in finding that he waived his right to counsel.Â  However, the PCR judge merely found Petitioner was acting pro se.Â  The PCR judge did not address the voluntariness of the waiver.\r\n[3]In his PCR application, Petitioner raised only the issue ofÂ  ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  He contends trial counsel was ineffective in failing to appear at trial and in failing to advise him of his rights, particularly the right to appeal.Â  In his PCR application, he raised only the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. Â However, the issue of whether he voluntarily proceeded pro se was raised at the PCR hearing.Â  \r\n[4]But see Walker v. State, 676 S.W.2d 460 (Ark. 1984)(fact that petitioner is proceeding pro se does not in itself constitute good cause for failure to conform to the prevailing rules of procedure).\r\n[5]At the PCR hearing, Petitioner asserted that his divorce attorney represented him until sometime in 2000.Â  While his divorce attorney may have represented Petitioner in the divorce action until 2000, the evidence supports the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that his divorce attorney never represented Petitioner in the CDV action.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26096","title":"In the Matter of Scott L.

Hood, pro se, of Irmo.&nbsp; \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  This matter is before the Court on a Petition for Reciprocal Discipline[1] and an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) entered into by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent.[2]Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to either a two year definite suspension or an indefinite suspension from the practice of law.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  Furthermore, we impose an eighteen (18) month suspension from the practice of law as reciprocal discipline.Â  The suspensions shall be served concurrently and shall run retroactively from the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.[3]Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nI.\r\nIn December 2004, respondent was retained to represent Client Aâ€™s interest in a foreclosure action concerning property on which she held a judgment.Â  Client A paid respondent $375.00 and gave him her original documents.Â  Respondent sent her a filed copy of the Answer he had prepared but, subsequently, did not return any of her telephone calls and did not respond to the messages she left on his office door. Â Client A has not received a refund of her money or her original documents.Â  \r\nII.\r\nClient B retained respondent to file an appeal from a magistrateâ€™s court ruling in a civil suit against a car dealership.Â  Client B gave respondent $750.00 in fees and $100.00 in costs.Â  Respondent did not return Client Bâ€™s telephone calls for updates on her case.Â  Respondent closed his office and has refused to communicate with Client B.Â  Client B has since lost her car as well as the $850.00 she paid respondent.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nClient C retained respondent to represent her in a consumer matter wherein Client C was wrongly reported to have filed for bankruptcy.Â  Client Câ€™s deposition was scheduled; without notice to her, respondent changed the deposition date.Â  Client C was unable to locate respondent for some time. Â Client Câ€™s deposition was subsequently taken.Â  Her legal matter has not been resolved.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court suspended respondent from filing new bankruptcy cases for a period of at least eighteen months, with conditions.Â  The Bankruptcy Court determined respondent had violated its rules regarding electronic filing and had perjured himself by attesting that his clients had signed the original documents when they had not.Â  Additionally, the Bankruptcy Court determined that several of respondentâ€™s cases had administrative deficiencies which had not been corrected.[4]Â Â  \r\nV.\r\nRespondent was paid $200.00 to update two (2) wills.Â  Respondent repeatedly missed appointments with the clients and did not prepare the wills or refund the fee.\r\nVI.\r\nClients retained respondent to represent them in a bankruptcy filing.Â  Months later, respondent wrote and told the clients that their house might be foreclosed because they had not paid their mortgage.Â  The clients were unable to locate respondent during this period of time and are now unable to produce the large cash payment necessary to avoid foreclosure.Â  The clients are expecting to lose their home.Â  \r\nVII.\r\nRespondent failed to comply with a final decision of the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board directing him to pay a construction company $700.00.Â  The certificate of non-compliances is dated July 25, 2005.\r\nVIII.\r\nIn November 2003, Client D retained respondent to handle a mortgage foreclosure.Â  In August 2004, respondent told Client D that he was waiting for a court date.Â  Client D received a letter from respondent dated June 30, 2005, in which respondent advised that the court had ruled on the foreclosure and his property would proceed to sale.Â  Respondent told Client D that the hearing was â€œlast minuteâ€ and he did not have time to contact Client D to advise him of the hearing.Â  Client D later learned from the Clerkâ€™s Office that the hearing notice was sent on May 27, 2005 and that the hearing was on June 30, 2005.Â  Client D hired another attorney and learned that respondent had agreed to the foreclosure sale without consulting with him.Â  \r\n_____\r\nRespondent admits that, while undertaking a career change, he did not take the action necessary to protect his clients during the transition.Â  Respondent asserts he does not believe he will ever desire to practice law again.Â  \r\nRespondent states he consented to the Court placing him on interim suspension and that he has assisted the attorney appointed to protect his clientsâ€™ interests.Â  He further notes he signed a consent order with the Bankruptcy Court in which he agreed not to accept any new cases for a period of at least eighteen (18) months.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep clients informed); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not charge excessive fee); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver to client any funds or other property to which client is entitled); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of his client); Rule 3.3 (lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal); Rule 3.4(c) (lawyer shall not knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).[5]\r\nÂ In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(2) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct violating the applicable rules of professional conduct of another jurisdiction), Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(10) (lawyer shall not willfully fail to comply with a final decision of the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  In addition, we suspend respondent from the practice of law for eighteen (18) months.Â  The suspensions shall be served concurrently and shall run retroactively from the date respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  \r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay restitution to all clients, other persons, and entities who have incurred losses as a result of respondentâ€™s misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall also reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection for any claims paid as a result of his misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  ODC shall advise the Court that respondent has paid the restitution required by this order.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION;

Frampton, of Chellis &amp; Frampton, of Summerville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Buist v. Huggins et. al., Op. No. 2003-UP-533 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Sept. 4, 2003), in which the Court of Appeals heldÂ  the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review a countyâ€™s assessment of interest for the redemption of property from a delinquent tax sale pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90 (2000).Â  We affirm in result, as modified.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitionersâ€™ properties were sold at delinquent tax sales.Â  Petitioners sought to redeem their properties pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90 (2000).[1]\r\nThe Buist property was sold by Charleston County for $90,000.00 on October 7, 1996, as a result of $4520.88 in delinquent taxes owed.[2]Â  Buist redeemed the property on January 21, 1997.Â  To redeem the property, Buist was required to pay the back taxes owed, plus $678.00 late payment interest, a $100.00 levy fee, and $7200.00 â€œbidder interestâ€ pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90,Â  calculated by County at 8% of the total amount of the successful bid on the property ($90,000 x 8%). Buist paid the $7200.00 bidder interest under protest, asserting that it should be calculated on a per diem basis, rather than assessed for an entire year.Â  Buist filed a claim for a refund pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-2560 with the County Board of Assessment Control.Â  The Charleston County Tax Refund Committee denied the request, and the Board of Assessment Appeals affirmed.Â  Buist filed a notice of appeal and request for a contested case hearing with the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Division.Â  \r\nPetitioner Worsley owed $4728.98 in taxes, penalties and costs, and his property was sold by Dorchester County for $153,000.00 on November 3, 1997.Â  Worsley redeemed the property on December 31, 1997.Â  To redeem the property, Worsley paid $4728.98 back taxes, plus $12,240.00 bidder interest, calculated by County at 8% of the total amount of the successful bid on the property ($153,000 x 8%), pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90.Â  Worsley paid the $12,240.00 bidder interest under protest, and sought a refund under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-2560, claiming interest should be calculated on a per diem basis.Â  Dorchester County denied the request for refund. Â The Board of Assessment Appeals for Dorchester County denied the appeal, finding Â§ 12-60-2560 inapplicable to contest the interest paid to redeem real property.Â  Worsley filed a notice of appeal with the\r\nALJ. \r\nThe same ALJ heard both the Buist and Worsley appeals.Â  The ALJ held that the legislature intended the term â€œinterestâ€ as used in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90 to be used in its plain and ordinary terms, such that the counties should not be interpreting it to authorize a flat-rate interest â€œpenalty.â€Â  Accordingly, the ALJ found interest should be calculated on a per diem basis, entitling Buist and Worsley to a refund.Â  \r\nCounties sought judicial review, and the cases were consolidated for a hearing.Â  The circuit court reversed, finding the ALJ was without jurisdiction over matters arising under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 et seq. (the Alternate Procedures Act).Â  The circuit court held the Revenue Procedures Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-2560, under which Petitioners had sought relief, was inapplicable to their claims for a refund.Â  The circuit court reasoned that the â€œinterestâ€ due under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90 is not a â€œdisputed revenue liabilityâ€ so as to fall within the meaning of the section 12-60-20 of the Revenue Procedures Act.Â  It held the ALJ did not have jurisdiction to determine whether Counties properly calculated interest under Â§ 12-51-40 of the Alternate Procedures Act.Â  The circuit court lastly ruled that that the term â€œinterestâ€ as used in Â§ 12-51-90 was intended by the Legislature to constitute a â€œpenaltyâ€ such that the interest was properly calculated by Counties as a lump sum based upon the whole amount of the tax sale bid regardless of when the property was redeemed.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that the ALJ was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.Â  However, the Court of Appeals also held that because the ALJ lacked jurisdiction, the circuit court was likewise without jurisdiction to address the merits of the issue in its appellate capacity.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals did not address the proper calculation of â€œinterestâ€ under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in concluding the ALJ was without subject matter jurisdiction?\r\n2.Â  Is the interest collected pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90 properly calculated based on a flat fee, or on a per diem basis?\r\n\r\n1.Â  JURISDICTION\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 et seq. sets forth an Alternate Procedure for collection of county taxes, authorizing counties to seize property and sell it at a delinquent tax sale.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90, the defaulting taxpayer may redeem the property within one year of the tax sale by â€œpaying the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties and costs, together with interest as provided in subsection B.â€[3]\r\nPetitioners redeemed their properties within the first year, but challenged the countiesâ€™ calculation of the amount of interest.Â  Accordingly, they paid under protest and filed claims for refunds pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-2560, which is contained in the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-10 et seq.Â  It is undisputed that a claim for a â€œrefund of real property taxes assessed by the countyâ€ is made to the ALJ Division under Â§ 12-60-2560 of the Revenue Procedures Act.[4]Â  \r\nPetitionersâ€™ citeÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-80 of the Revenue Procedures Act, and this Courtâ€™s opinion in Brackenbrook v. County of North Charleston, 360 S.C. 390, 395, 602 S.E.2d 39, 42 (2004), in support of their claim that the ALJ had jurisdiction.Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-80 provides, in part, â€œthere is no remedy other than those provided in this chapter in any case involving the illegal or wrongful collection of taxes, or attempt to collect taxes.â€[5]Â  This Court interpreted Â§ 12-60-80 in Brackenbrook.Â  There, taxpayers brought an action in circuit court alleging Charleston County levied an excessive millage rate on real property. The circuit court allowed the taxpayersâ€™ suit, finding taxpayers had no administrative remedies under the Revenue Procedures Act (RPA) because the Act did not cover taxpayer challenges to the countyâ€™s millage rate determination. The circuit court concluded the RPAâ€™s mandated administrative remedies only applied to taxpayer challenges to a countyâ€™s â€œproperty tax assessment.â€Â  Because the taxpayers in Brackenbrook did not dispute any component of their property tax assessment, the circuit court held they had an immediate right to bring suit in circuit court. A majority of this Court reversed, holding that:\r\n\r\nWhile the Act contains many specific procedures for taxpayers challenging their [property tax assessments], relief under the Act is not limited to these types of protests. Section 12-60-2530(A) specifically provides the board of assessment appeals may rule on any PTA dispute and also other relevant claims of a legal or factual nature except claims relating to property tax exemptions.\r\n\r\n360 S.C. at 398, 602 S.E.2d at 44.Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\nTwo justices dissented in Brackenbrook, finding the administrative remedy set forth in Â§ 12-60-2560 applicable only to challenges to property tax assessments, but not to challenges to the proper millage rate to be applied in calculating the amount of tax due.Â  Accordingly, the dissent would have held the administrative remedy limitation in Â§ 12-60-80Â  did not control.\r\nThe circuit court in this case, as well as the Court of Appeals, found that Petitionersâ€™ claims did not involve a challenge to a property tax assessment but, rather, a claim for a refund of interest paid to the Delinquent Tax Collector,[6] and that the only provisions governing redemption of property sold at a delinquent tax sale were found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90, so as to fall within the Alternate Procedures Act, requiring suit to be brought in the circuit court. Â We agree. \r\nUnlike Brackenbrook, Petitioners in this case challenge neither their underlying tax assessments, nor their millage rates.Â  Rather, Petitioners challenge only the calculation of interest under Â§ 12-51-90.Â  While their interest payment could feasibly be lowered, the underlying tax amount owed is not disputed.Â  Accordingly, we find their challenge is properly brought under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90, such that the Alternate Procedures Act controls. Â The Court of Appeals properly held jurisdiction over such disputes remains in the circuit court, and the ALJ was without jurisdiction.[7]  \r\n2.Â  CALCULATION OF INTEREST[8]\r\nAs noted previously, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90 permits a defaulting taxpayer to redeem property within one year of a delinquent tax sale and sets forth the interest to be paid.Â  As it read at the time these properties were redeemed, Â§ 12-51-90 provided that a defaulting taxpayer could redeem the property upon payment of the â€œdelinquent taxes, assessments, penalties and costs, together with eight percent interest on the whole amount of the delinquent tax sale bid. . . . In the case of a redemption in the last six months of the redemption period, . . . the applicable rate of interest is twelve percent.â€Â  Emphasis supplied.[9]Â Â  \r\nIf a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€ Â Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  The words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.Â \r\nHitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207 (2003).\r\nThe construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.Â  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002) (quoting Dunton v. South Carolina Bd. of Examiners in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987)); see also Nucor Steel v. South Carolina Public Serv. Commâ€™n, 310 S.C. 539, 543, 426 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1992) (where an agency is charged with the execution of a statute, the agencyâ€™s interpretation should not be overruled without cogent reason).\r\nIt is undisputed that counties have uniformly been collecting a flat rate of interest on redeemed properties.Â  Further, under a plain reading of the statute, it is clear the Legislature intended to impose a flat-fee interest rate of 8% on property redeemed within the first six months, and a 12% rate for the last six months.Â  In light of the wording of the statute that the interest is charged on the whole amount of the delinquent tax sale bid, and the fact that the rate increases to 12% if not paid within the first 6 months, it is patent that the Legislature intended a flatÂ  rate of interest.Â  This result is bolstered by the recent amendments to Â§ 12-51-90, as shown in footnote 9, which imposes a different interest rate depending upon which quarter the property is redeemed (3%, 6%, 9% and 12%).Â  See Cotty v. Yartzeff, 309 S.C. 259, 422 S.E.2d 100 (1992) (subsequent statutory amendment may be interpreted as clarifying original legislative intent).Â  We find nothing in the language of Â§ 12-51-90 indicating a legislative intent that interest be paid on a per diem basis.Â  \r\nPetitioners cite S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-54-25(D), governing the interest due on late taxes, and the applicable tax rate, which states that â€œthe rate of interest on underpayments and overpayments is established by the department in the same manner and at the same time as the underpayment rate provided in Internal Revenue Code Sections 6621(a)(2) and 6622.â€Â  Under IRC Code 6622, interest is compounded daily.Â  The compounding of interest under Â§ 12-54-25(D) is inapplicable here.Â  Section 12-51-90 does not deal with the late payment of taxes but, rather, the redemption of property sold at a delinquent tax sale.Â  Further, the Legislature saw fit, in Â§ 12-54-25(D) to set forth a federal tax code section upon which interest would be based.Â  Had the Legislature intended interest under section 12-51-90 to be compounded as set forth in the IRC, it could have plainly said so.Â  See Tilley v. Pacesetter, 333 S.C. 33, 508 S.E.2d 16 (1998) (if legislature had intended a certain result in statute it would have said so).[10] Â Â The circuit court correctly held Â§ 12-51-90 imposes a flat rate interest fee.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling that the ALJ lacked jurisdiction over Petitionersâ€™ claims.Â  We also affirm the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that Petitioners were properly charged a flat rate of interest. \r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  The cases were consolidated for appeal and involve two separate properties; the Worsley property located in Dorchester County, and the Buist property located on Kiawah Island in Charleston County.\r\n[2]Â  Buist is the attorney for the property owners, Michael and Sharon Mayberry.\r\n[3] Â The amount of interest is addressed in Issue 2 below.Â  \r\n[4]Â  As noted by the majority of the Court in Brackenbrook v. County of North Charleston, 360 S.C. 390, 395, 602 S.E.2d 39, 42 (2004), â€œthe General Assembly adopted the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act (the Act) to provide the people of this State with a straight forward procedure to determine any disputed revenue liability.â€\r\n[5]  Â An exception is provided for cases involving the constitutionality of a statute.\r\n[6]Â  The circuit court was persuaded by the fact that the taxes are required by Â§Â§ 12-51-40 through 12-51-60 to be paid to the delinquent tax collector, rather than the auditor.\r\n[7] Â This result is buttressed by the fact that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-2560 (under which the ALJâ€™s jurisdiction in this case is premised) requires a taxpayer to seek a refund â€œby filing a claim for refund with the county assessor who made the property tax assessment for the property for which the tax refund is sought.â€Â  Here, the assessment of interest was made by the Delinquent Tax Collector rather than the county assessor.\r\n[8]Â  In light of our ruling on the subject matter jurisdiction issue, we would not normally address this issue.Â  However, because the circuit court has already addressed this issue, and in the interest of judicial economy, we proceed to review the proper calculation of interest. \r\n[9]Â  The statute has been amended several times since its adoption in 1962.Â  Each version of the statute, however, has included terminology that the interest is to be â€œon the whole amount of the delinquent tax sale bid.Â  Section 12-51-90 was most recently amended in 2000 and now reads:Â  The lump sum amount of interest due on the whole amount of the delinquent tax sale based on the month during the redemption period the property is redeemed and that rate relates back to the beginning of the redemption period according to the following schedule: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Month of Redemption Period:\r\n         Amount of Interest Imposed:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        First three months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n         three percent of the bid amount \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Months four, five, and six&nbsp; \r\n         six percent of the bid amount \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Months seven, eight, and\r\n          nine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n         nine percent of the bid amount \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Last three\r\n          months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         twelve percent of the bid\r\n          amount\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n[10] Â Interestingly, at the time of this action, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20 stated that â€œ. . . in all cases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths percent per annum.â€Â  Emphasis supplied.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of James T.

\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  2.Â  Did the court err in allowing the solicitor to question the apartment manager, Fuller, as to whether anyone other than Weston had any animosity toward Franchey?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3.Â  Did the court err in allowing a police officer to testify that, other than Weston, she had never had anybody blankly stare at her and not respond to her questions?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  4.Â  Did the court err in allowing testimony to the effect that Weston stated, â€œI need a lawyerâ€ upon finding a search warrant the police had left inside his storage unit?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  5.Â  Did the court err in refusing to grant a directed verdict of acquittal to the charge of murder since the evidence raised only a suspicion of his guilt?\r\n1.Â  TESTIMONY RE FRANCHEYâ€™S CHANGE OF DEMEANOR\r\nWeston asserts the testimony of Suzanne Allen and Toni Franchey was improper under this Courtâ€™s opinion in State v. Garcia and under Rule 803(3), SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nSuzanne Allen, a friend of Franchey, testified that, during the time period before Weston moved in with her, Franchey was a happy person, cheerful, and fun to be with.Â  When the Solicitor asked Allen what was Francheyâ€™s state of mind concerning Weston, defense counselâ€™s objection pursuant to State v. Garcia, 334 S.C. 71, 512 S.E.2d 507 (1999) was overruled.Â  Allen testified â€œShe was very unhappy.â€Â  The colloquy continued as follows:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  She was unhappy?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Very unhappy.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  Had her demeanor changed as she lived with her son?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Oh, yes.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  That summer of 1998, had you given her any advice about her son?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Yes, I encouraged her to ask him to leave by maybe providing some funds for him to get a place of his own because she seemed so miserable having him live with her. . . . \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . . . . \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  Did you have a conversation with Ms. Franchey on that Tuesday?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A. Yes. . . . \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  Did she tell you that she intended to do something?. . . \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Yes. . . . she said, Iâ€™m finally going to ask him to leave, I want my home back.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q. . . . Did you ever talk to her after that Tuesday, August the 4th?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  No I did not.\r\nThereafter, the state called Westonâ€™s sister, Toni Franchey, from whom Weston had been estranged for many years.Â  Toni Franchey was living in Australia at the time of her motherâ€™s disappearance, but had come to Columbia for a family reunion in the summer of 1997.Â  She testified that â€œat that time, I discussed with the family the fact that I became aware that Jeff was planning to move in with my mother and I strongly opposed it.Â  I was afraid.â€ Â Â  Toni Franchey went on to testify about her July 1998 visit at which time she advised her mother that she should find Weston alternate housing.Â  The state queried as follows:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.Â  During that two week period just before your motherâ€™s disappearance, what was her - - I need to be specific.Â  What was her state of mind about Jeff?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defense counsel:Â  I object to that.Â  That is not a proper state of mind question.Â  Foundation is not proper and I submit itâ€™s hearsay.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court:Â  Overruled.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.Â  She was - - she seemedâ€”she seemed more nervous and ---\r\nDefense counsel objected that this was not within the Garcia exception.Â  The court overruled the objection and Toni Franchey continued:\r\nShe seemed much more nervous and anxious than normal.Â  My mother is very vivacious, outgoing and loves to, you know, have a laugh and, you know, go out and get something to eat and she just seemed more anxious and just uncertain.Â  I know that while we were doing the house we - she said, well, please donâ€™t touch anything in Jeffâ€™s room and we didnâ€™t because she was afraid.\r\nWeston contends the testimony of Suzanne Allen and Toni Franchey was improper.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Garcia, the defendant was charged with the murder of his girlfriend.Â  He admitted shooting her, but claimed it had been an accident.[5]Â  At trial, Garcia objected to the testimony of two witnesses who testified that the decedent was scared of him.Â  These witnesses were allowed to go further and state that the day before her death, the victim had told her grandmother that Garcia kicked her, causing a bruise below her knee, and that, a week before her death, Garcia had told the victim that if she ever left him, he would kill her.Â  331 S.C. at 73-74, 512 S.E.2d at 508.Â  \r\nWe held, â€œthe victimâ€™s state of mind - that she was scared of appellant - was relevant because it -tended to disprove appellantâ€™s contention the shooting was an accident; the victim's fear suggests appellant may have intended the shooting.â€Â  Id. at 74, 512 S.E.2d at 608.Â  We then went on to hold:\r\nConsequently, while the present state of the declarantâ€™s mind is admissible as an exception to hearsay, the reason for the declarant's state of mind is not.Â  United States v. Cohen, 631 F.2d 1223, 1225 (5th Cir.1980) (â€œBut the state-of-mind exception does not permit the witness to relate any of the declarant's statements as to why he held the particular state of mind, or what he might have believed that would have induced the state of mind. If the reservation in the text of the rule is to have any effect, it must be understood to narrowly limit those admissible statements to declarations of conditionâ€”â€˜Iâ€™m scaredâ€™--and not beliefâ€”â€˜Iâ€™m scared because [someone] threatened meâ€™.â€\r\n334 S.C. at 76, 512 S.E.2d at 508 (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\nWe find the testimony in the present case was properly admitted under Garcia.Â  The testimony in this case did not give a reason for Mrs. Francheyâ€™s fear.Â  Rather, Toni Franchey and Suzanne Allen testified only that Mrs. Franchey was afraid of Weston.Â  To read Garcia as Weston suggests would require us to hold that a witness may testify to the fact that the decedent was afraid, but not that the decedent was afraid of the defendant.Â  This is simply too constrained a reading of Garcia.Â  We specifically held that â€œthe victimâ€™s state of mind- - that she was scared of appellant- - was relevant. . .â€ 334 S.C. at 74, 512 S.E.2d at 508.Â  Accordingly, the testimony here was clearly admissible under Garcia.\r\nn any event, even had the testimony been improperly admitted, Weston simply cannot demonstrate reversible error.Â  The improper admission of hearsay is reversible error only when the admission causes prejudice.Â  State v. Craig, 267 S.C. 262, 227 S.E.2d 306 (1976); State v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 472 S.E.2d 235 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1061 (1997) (error without prejudice does not warrant reversal); State v. Mizell, 332 S.C. 273, 504 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 1998) (in order to obtain new trial based upon erroneous admission of evidence, appellant must demonstrate both error and prejudice).Â  \r\nHere, prior to the testimony of either Suzanne Allen or Toni Franchey, the assistant manager of the apartment complex, Leslie Fuller, testified.Â  When asked what was Francheyâ€™s state of mind in reference to her son the weekend of August 7-9, 1998, Fuller testified, without objection, as follows:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Well, when I saw her she was - she was usually crying and wringing her hands and I would say depressed, anxious.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  And who was she depressed or anxious about when she would - Were you aware of who she was depressed or anxious about?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Yeah, she talked with me about it.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q. And who was she depressed or anxious about?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  About Jeff.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  And that would be her son?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Yes.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . . . . . \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  Did you give her any advice about her son?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  We talked about - - about her having Jeff move out.\r\nSimilarly, Claudia Young, the manager for the apartment complex until July 30, 1998, testified as to her observations of Francheyâ€™s demeanor up until her son came to live with her.Â  Concerning the week leading up to Francheyâ€™s disappearance, Young was questioned:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  And during that time period did you become aware of her state of mind leading up until when you left July the 30th?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Yes, I was.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  What was her state of mind in regard to the defendant?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  She did not want him to live there.Â  She was terrified.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  And she was terrified specifically of whom?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Her son.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  And did you ever witness her demonstrating or did she ever do anything in your presence that indicated that?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . . \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  She cried.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  What did you suggest she do?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  I asked her to let me change the locks on her apartment.\r\nWeston did not object to this testimony.[6]\r\nGiven the testimony of Fuller and Young, the testimony of Allen and Toni Franchey was merely cumulative such that Weston cannot demonstrate prejudice.Â  State v. Craig, supra (improper admission of hearsay is reversible error only when the admission causes prejudice).Â  \r\n2.Â  WESTONâ€™S ANIMOSITY TOWARD HIS MOTHER\r\nWeston next asserts error in the solicitorâ€™s question to Leslie Fuller as to whether or not Fuller knew of anyone else, other than Francheyâ€™s son, who had any animosity toward Mrs. Franchey, contending this injected the solicitorâ€™s personal opinion into the matter, and was not based upon the evidence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nContrary to Westonâ€™s contention, immediately prior to this question, the solicitor questioned Fuller as to Francheyâ€™s disappearance.Â  Fuller testified she had gone to check on Franchey around 10:00 a.m. on the morning of August 8, 1998, and gotten no answer when she knocked at the door.Â  She continued calling and left a message on Francheyâ€™s answering machine.Â  The following morning, after several phone calls to Francheyâ€™s telephone, Fuller contacted the apartment security officer, Jarvis, and they went and did a walk-through of the apartment.Â  She finally got in touch with Weston at about 4:40 that afternoon and he expressed no concern over his motherâ€™s disappearance, telling her â€œshe met some man and she ran off with him.Â  She left me a note on the coffee table.â€Â  Fuller continued to testify:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â  I donâ€™t recall if it was Monday or Tuesday, but one of those days he came back into my office.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Q.Â  And what was his demeanor when he entered your office that Monday or Tuesday?\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â Â  He was very disheveled and he was sweating profusely.Â  His eyes were huge.Â  And he just stood over my desk and he said, to begin with, I was really angry with my mother, and now Iâ€™m just scared.â€\r\nContrary to Westonâ€™s assertion, the above testimony is some evidence of animosity upon which the solicitor properly based her question.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly overruled his objection.Â  \r\n3.Â  WESTONâ€™S RESPONSE TO KATHY JARVIS\r\nWeston objects to the testimony of Kathy Jarvis, the Richland County sheriffâ€™s deputy who served as â€œcourtesy officerâ€ for the apartment complex, to the effect that, when questioned about his Motherâ€™s disappearance, Weston â€œwouldnâ€™t answer anything,â€ was â€œtotally unresponsive,â€ and â€œdid not seem concernedâ€ about his mother.Â  \r\nAlthough Weston now complains Jarvis gave unqualified â€œexpertâ€ testimony, the only objection below was that Jarvis was giving her opinion.Â  Accordingly, this issue is procedurally barred from review because it differs from the objection raised at trial.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 587 S.E.2d 691 (2003); State v. Prioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 548 S.E.2d 213 (2001); State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 526 S.E.2d 228 (2000) (party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal).Â  \r\nIn any event, Jarvis was simply relaying her personal experience in law enforcement and the fact that she had not encountered anyone so unresponsive.Â  We find no basis for objection.Â  State v. McClinton, 265 S.C. 171, 217 S.E.2d 584 (1975) (witness may state his impression or inference with respect to the appearance of a person, animal, object, or place if he has had adequate opportunity for observation, the details of such appearance cannot be reproduced before the jury to enable them to draw a correct inference, and he states as much as possible of the constituent facts).Â  \r\n4.Â  WESTONâ€™S STATEMENT AT STORAGE UNIT\r\nWeston moved out of his motherâ€™s apartment the weekend of August 21, 1998, and moved into an apartment on Confederate Avenue, owned by his friend, Francis Perna.Â  Perna helped Weston move into the apartment, retrieving Westonâ€™s personal belongings both from the apartment in Harbison, and from a Public Storage Unit on Broad River Road.Â  When they arrived at the storage unit, they found a search warrant.Â  Weston read the search warrant and said, â€œI need a lawyer.â€Â  \r\nWeston asserts the trial court erred in allowing Perna to comment that he stated â€œI need a lawyer.â€ Â He contends this was an improper comment on his right to an attorney and that, in any event, it was impermissible under Rule 403, SCRE, as its prejudice outweighed its probative value.Â  We disagree and find Weston has not shown reversible error from admission of this single comment. \r\nIn Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976), the United States Supreme Court held that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a state prosecutor seeks to impeach a defendantâ€™s exculpatory story, told for the first time at the trial, by cross-examining him about his post-arrest silence after receiving Miranda warnings.Â  Doyle also prohibits the State from commenting upon the defendantâ€™s request for an attorney. See Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284 (1986); Edmond v. State, 341 S.C. 340, 345, 534 S.E.2d 682, 685 (2000).Â  The rationale for Doyle is that it would be a violation of due process to allow comment on the silence which Miranda warnings have encouraged.Â  \r\nSubsequent to Doyle, inÂ  Fletcher v. Weir, 455 U.S. 603 (1982), the Supreme Court clarified that Doyle was applicable only in situations in which the government had induced, via Miranda warnings, a defendantâ€™s belief that his exercise of a constitutional right would not be used against him.Â  455 U.S. at 607 (â€œin the absence of the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the Miranda warnings, we do not believe that it violates due process of law for a State to permit cross-examination as to post arrest silence when a defendant chooses to take the stand.â€Â  See also State v. Bell, 347 S.C. 267, 554 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2001) (recognizing that Doyle is applicable only after Miranda warnings have been given).Â Â  \r\n Doyle is simply inapplicable here.Â  Unlike Doyle, Weston was not under arrest at the time he told Perna that he needed a lawyer, nor had he been given Miranda warnings by authorities.Â  Under Fletcher, it is clear Doyle is inapplicable to Westonâ€™s statement to his friend.Â  Accord State v. Baccam, 476 N.W.2d 884, 886 (Iowa Ct.App.1991).\r\n5.Â  DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nLastly, Weston contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict, claiming the state failed to prove the corpus delicti of a murder and that there was no evidence he caused Mrs. Francheyâ€™s death.Â  We disagree and find the matter was properly submitted to the jury.Â  \r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the state fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the state.Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593-593, 606 S.E.2d 475, 477-478 (2004).Â  See also State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002); State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002); State v. Venters, 300 S.C. 260, 264, 387 S.E.2d 270, 272-73 (1990). \r\nIn a murder case, the corpus delicti consists of two elements: the death of a human being, and the criminal act of another in causing that death. State v. Martin, 47 S.C. 67, 25 S.E. 113 (1896).Â  In State v. Owens, 293 S.C. 161, 359 S.E.2d 275 (1987), this Court held that the circumstantial evidence surrounding the victimâ€™s sudden disappearance, considered with the unlikelihood of his voluntary departure as shown by his personal habits and relationships, was sufficient to establish the corpus delicti of murder or that the victim is dead by the criminal act of another. Â See State v. Speights, 263 S.C. 127, 208 S.E.2d 43 (1974).Â  See also State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 S.E.2d 620 (1996).Â  \r\nHere, the state presented evidence that Mrs. Franchey had an active social life, was active with friends, at bridge club, and regularly kept in touch with the apartment complex managers, her sister, and her friends.Â  She was last seen on August 6, 1998, via a bank video camera, making a withdrawal from her bank account.Â  She has not been seen nor heard from since.Â  Under Owens, the stateâ€™s presentation of the victimâ€™s habits, coupled with her mysterious disappearance, and the fact that she has not been seen nor heard from since August 1998, are sufficient to establish the corpus delicti of murder.\r\nFurther, the evidence presented by the state warranted submission of the case to the jury.Â  Evidence was presented that Weston had gone to live with his mother in the fall of 1997, and that she became very upset and was depressed Weston was living with her.Â  Friends and family advised Franchey to either change the locks, eject Weston, or find him another place to live.Â  Two days before her disappearance, Franchey told a friend she had decided to tell Weston to leave.Â  She was last seen alive on August 6, 1998.Â  The same day, the maintenance supervisor of the apartment complex noticed that the trunk to Mrs. Francheyâ€™s vehicle was open, and was lined with clear plastic.Â  The maintenance supervisor also testified that Franchey, a retired educator, did not have any bumper stickers on her car but that, immediately after she disappeared, a sticker which read â€œMy kid beat up your honor roll studentâ€ was on the car.Â Â  The apartment manager testified that when she went to the apartment on Aug. 8th, the shower curtain in Francheyâ€™s bathroom was missing.\r\nRandy Myers, an apartment complex resident, testified that at 4:30 a.m. on Saturday, August 8th, he saw Weston loading garbage bags into the trunk of Francheyâ€™s car.Â  Several people also testified that they had never seen Weston drive Francheyâ€™s car before, Weston did not have a driverâ€™s license, and that immediately after Franchey disappeared, Weston was driving her car.Â  \r\nThe apartment complex manager testified that, when she went to check on Franchey, she saw that Francheyâ€™s plants on her back patio were turned over, and there was an empty bleach bottle on the porch.Â  When initially confronted by the apartment complex manager and Officer Jarvis, Weston told them his mother had â€œmet some man and run off with himâ€ leaving him a note on the coffee table.Â  No other witness had any knowledge of an alleged boyfriend.Â  Further, although the apartment complex manager and Jarvis remembered seeing Francheyâ€™s purse and glasses on her bed in the apartment on August 8th, Weston told police that his motherâ€™s purse was missing.Â Â  The apartment complex manager also testified that Weston came into her office a day or two later, very disheveled, sweating profusely, his eyes huge, and stated, â€œI was really angry with my mother and now Iâ€™m just scared.â€Â  \r\nImmediately after Francheyâ€™s disappearance, Weston called in sick to his job at Target for two days, saying he had a virus.Â  He returned to work on Monday, August 10th, and was seen by employees to have a limp, a bruise under his eye, and scratches on his arms.Â Â  He told his supervisor his cat had scratched him.Â  He told another co-worker he had stepped off a curb and fallen into some bushes.Â  When Jarvis and the apartment manager spoke to Weston at Francheyâ€™s apartment, Weston was wearing a heavy black jacket on a hot August day such that his arms were not visible.Â  When Weston went back to work at Target, he bought a new shower curtain, and a rug.Â  When police investigated the apartment, they found an area rug covering a hole in the carpet of the living room floor.Â  Linoleum in the kitchen floor had also been torn up and was missing.Â  Police tested the floor where the linoleum had been removed and found blood; blood was also found on drag marks leading from the hole in the carpet.Â  Investigators subsequently tested a piece of blood-stained molding from the apartment which was determined to be was Francheyâ€™s.Â  Blood was also found on the rubber ring that lined the trunk of Francheyâ€™s car.Â  \r\nThe above evidence, although circumstantial, is clearly sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict.Â  Â The judgment below is affirmed.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, J.J., and Acting Justice Stephen S. Bartlett concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  There was also testimony that Weston called in sick from his job at Target on Thurs. and Friday, August 6th and 7th, telling his supervisor he had a stomach virus.Â  \r\n[2] Â Westonâ€™s sister, Toni Franchey, testified that her mother did not allow him to drive the car as he did not have a driverâ€™s license.Â  \r\n[3] Â No other witness had ever seen Franchey in the company of a boyfriend.\r\n[4] Â Weston had purchased a shower curtain and an area rug from his job at Target during the week of August 10-14th.Â  \r\n[5] Â As here, the defendant in Garcia offered no evidence at trial.\r\n[6] Â Although Weston did object to the proper foundation,Â  no further objection is contained in the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Robert Edward Hemingway","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2006-01-10-01","description":"This is an order placing an attorney on interim suspension.","date":"2006-01-17","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South\r\nCarolina\r\nIn the Matter of Robert Edward Hemingway, Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel has filed a petition asking this Court to place respondent on interim suspension pursuant to Rule 17(b) and (c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and seeking the appointment of an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nIT IS ORDERED that respondentâ€™s license to practice law in this state is suspended until further order of the Court.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Warren R.

Buyck, Jr.,Â  of Wilcox Buyck &amp; Williams, of Florence; and Robert H. Hood, D. Nathan Hughey, and Deborah H. Sheffield, all of Hood Law Firm, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Willie Mae David (Appellant), the plaintiff in the underlying medical malpractice action, appeals the trial courtâ€™s decision granting the respondentsâ€™ motions for summary judgment.Â  This case was certified from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We withdraw our original opinion in this matter and substitute it with this opinion affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nFactual /Procedural Background\r\nAppellant underwent surgery after her family doctor found a lesion on Appellantâ€™s lower left lung.Â  Specifically, Appellant underwent a â€œwedge biopsy,â€ where a thoracic surgeon extracted a portion of the suspicious tissue and sent the tissue to a pathologist for diagnosis.Â  The pathologist returned a preliminary diagnosis of â€œprobable pulmonary blastoma,â€ a rare form of cancer, which was confirmed by the pathologistâ€™s partner.Â  Based on this diagnosis, the thoracic surgeon decided to remove the lower left portion of Appellantâ€™s lung while Appellant was still anesthetized and unconscious.\r\nA final pathology report, issued three days after the surgery, concluded that the lesion was not cancerous, but rather, a â€œpulmonary endometrioma;â€ a rare form of endometriosis, which, from a visual inspection, closely resembles pulmonary blastoma.[1]Â  \r\nAppellant filed the underlying action and named the following parties as defendants: (1) the hospital where the surgery took place (McLeod Regional), (2) the thoracic surgeon who performed the surgery (Dr. Brusett), (3) Dr. Brusettâ€™s practice group (Pee Dee Cardiovascular Surgeons), (4) the pathologist who provided the preliminary diagnosis (Dr. Habermeier), and (5) Dr. Habermeierâ€™s practice group (Pee Dee Pathology).Â  Appellant claimed that she suffers from several ailments as a result of the surgery, including chest and back pain, shortness of breath, and anxiety.\r\nRespondents filed separate motions for summary judgment.[2] Â McLeod Regional sought summary judgment on the grounds that any alleged malpractice was performed by independent contractors; therefore, the hospital could not be vicariously liable for Appellantâ€™s alleged injuries.Â  The remaining Respondents sought summary judgment arguing that Appellant had failed to establish the essential elements of her case; specifically, that Appellant had failed to produce expert testimony establishing the applicable standard of care, breach of that standard, and a causal connection between the breach and Appellantâ€™s injuries.Â  The trial court granted the Respondentsâ€™ motions for summary judgment in three separate orders.Â  Appellant now raises the following issues for review: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.\r\n        Did the trial court err in granting the respondent physiciansâ€™ motions for summary judgment?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.\r\n         Did the trial court err in holding that McLeod Regional was not vicariously liable for Appellantâ€™s alleged damages?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Respondent Physiciansâ€™ Motions for Summary Judgment\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the respondent physicians.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen reviewing an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard as the trial court. Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp; Fleming, 350 S.C. at 493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nAs the trial court recognized, the rules of civil procedure describe what an affidavit must contain in order to establish an issue of fact sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP provides that â€œ[s]upporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify as to the matters stated therein.â€\r\nA physician commits malpractice by not exercising that degree of skill and learning that is ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of the profession in good standing acting in the same or similar circumstances.Â  Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C. 639, 650-51, 62 S.E.2d 760, 766 (2004).Â  Additionally, medical malpractice lawsuits have specific requirements that must be satisfied in order for a genuine factual issue to exist.Â  Specifically, a plaintiff alleging medical malpractice must provide evidence showing (1) the generally recognized and accepted practices and procedures that would be followed by average, competent practitioners in the defendantsâ€™ field of medicine under the same or similar circumstances, and (2) that the defendants departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards.Â  Pederson v. Gould, 288 S.C. 141, 143-44, 341 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1986); Cox v. Lund, 286 S.C. 410, 414, 334 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1985).Â  Â Â Also, the plaintiff must show that the defendantsâ€™ departure from such generally recognized practices and procedures was the proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s alleged injuries and damages.Â  Green v. Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 193, 249 S.E.2d 910, 913 (1978).Â  The plaintiff must provide expert testimony to establish both the required standard of care and the defendantsâ€™ failure to conform to that standard, unless the subject matter lies within the ambit of common knowledge so that no special learning is required to evaluate the conduct of the defendants.Â  Pederson, 288 S.C. at 143, 341 S.E.2d at 634.Â  Therefore, in order to withstand a properly supported motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action, any affidavits presented to the court must first comply with the terms of Rule 56, SCRCP, and the evidence as a whole must meet the criteria laid out in Pederson and its progeny.\r\nIn the present case, Appellant relies solely on the affidavit of pathologist Dr. Brian Frist to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the commission of malpractice by the respondent physicians.[3]Â  The trial court ruled that Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit failed to establish that he is familiar with the standard of care from which the respondent physicians allegedly deviated.Â Â  We agree and find that the affidavit is insufficient.\r\nIn his affidavit, Dr. Fristâ€™s sole opinion as to Dr. Brusettâ€™s alleged malpractice is that Dr. Brusett failed â€œto make sure that he communicated to the pathologist his thoughts for treatment, so that the pathologist was aware of the treatment plan of the surgeon.â€Â  First, Dr. Frist incorrectly relies on the assumption that the pathologist would have diagnosed Appellantâ€™s tumor differently had Dr. Brusett â€œcommunicated his thoughts for treatmentâ€ before Appellantâ€™s tumor was tested.Â  Stated differently, Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit fails to explain how Dr. Brusettâ€™s post-diagnosis treatment would have affected the pathologistâ€™s initial diagnosis of the tumor.Â Â  As a result, there is no evidence that Dr. Brusettâ€™s failure to communicate Appellantâ€™s possible treatment options with the pathologist was the proximate cause of Appellantâ€™s injuries.Â  \r\nThe dissent asserts that had the pathologist been aware that Dr. Brusett intended to immediately remove the affected portion of the lung upon a diagnosis of pulmonary blastoma, then the pathologist might have qualified or sought to confirm his preliminary diagnosis.Â  The dissentâ€™s argument disregards the necessity that a surgeon be able to rely upon inter-operative diagnoses to determine a patientâ€™s proper treatment.Â  Moreover, the position argued by the dissent would set the precedent that a speculative hypothetical may serve as the standard of care in an action for medical malpractice.Â  In South Carolina, medical malpractice actions require a greater showing than generic allegations and conjecture.Â  \r\nSecond, Appellant provides no evidence that her expert, Dr. Frist, is familiar with the standard of care that Dr. Brusett or Dr. Habermeier allegedly breached, nor does Appellant offer what the applicable standard of care might be.Â  Nothing in Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit, or in the record, suggests it was unreasonable for Dr. Brusett to extract the lesion after receiving a diagnosis of â€œprobable pulmonary blastoma,â€ and nothing in Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit, or in the record, instructs the Court with any specificity as to how competent practitioners in these fields would have performed this procedure differently.Â  \r\nWe are mindful of the important interests at stake in this case.Â  People who receive sub-standard medical care must be able to recover for injuries caused by at-fault physicians, and Plaintiffs must have a meaningful opportunity to present and support their claims in court.Â  However, all of the evidence in this case suggests that Appellant received competent medical care.Â  This is a case where a thoracic surgeon removed a piece of suspicious tissue, a pathologist and his partner returned a preliminary diagnosis of rare cancer, and the surgeon decided to take the tissue out.Â  In support of her claim, Appellant offers an expertâ€™s affidavits saying â€œyou should have communicated better and you got the diagnosis wrong.â€Â  The affidavits do not establish how the facts of this case would be different had the surgeon and pathologist â€œcommunicated better,â€ nor do they address the standard of care in any detail. \r\nIn affirming the trial court, we rely solely on the requirements of Rule 56, SCRCP, and the specific requirements for expert testimony in medical malpractice actions.Â  A doctor need not practice in the particular area of medicine as the defendant doctor to be qualified to testify as an expert.Â  Creed v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 345, 426 S.E.2d 785, 786. (1993).Â  Regardless of the area in which the prospective expert witness practices, he must set forth the applicable standard of care for the medical procedure under scrutiny and he must demonstrate to the court that he is familiar with the standard of care.Â  A court considering summary judgment neither makes factual determinations nor considers the merits of competing testimony; however, summary judgment is completely appropriate when a properly supported motion sets forth facts that remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.Â  Despite Dr. Fristâ€™s qualifications, his affidavit does not set forth the standard of care he alleges was breached, nor does it provide that he is familiar the standard of care.Â  Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Respondents Brusett, Pee Dee Cardiovascular, Habermeier and Pee Dee Pathology.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Vicarious Liability of McLeod Regional \r\nAppellant argues that McLeod Regional had a nondelegable duty to provide competent pathology care to Appellant and therefore was vicariously liable for Dr. Habermeierâ€™s preliminary misdiagnosis that resulted in unnecessary surgery.Â  Because we hold that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Habermeier and Pee Dee Pathology, we need not address this issue.Â  See Rookland v. Atlanta &amp; C. Air Line Ry. Co., 84 S.C. 190, 192, 65 S.E. 1047, 1049 (1909) (judgment on the merits in favor of the agent bars a vicarious liability action against the principal).Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision granting the respondentsâ€™ motions for summary judgment.\r\nMOORE, J. and Acting Justice Paula H. Thomas concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent from the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm the grant of summary judgment to the Respondent doctors and their practices, but join the decision to affirm the grant to Respondent McLeod. As explained below, I find Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit adequate to create a genuine issue of material fact whether the communication between the surgeon and the pathologist fell below generally accepted standards and procedures.[4]\r\nÂ As I understand Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit, the assertion is that if Dr. Brusett had informed the pathologist that he intended to immediately remove the affected portion of the lung if the intra-operative diagnosis were cancer, then Dr. Habermeier might have qualified his preliminary diagnosis. Contrary to the majorityâ€™s characterization of the affidavit, it does not assume that Dr. Habermeierâ€™s diagnosis would have been different, but rather opines that had Dr. Habermeier been aware of Dr. Brusettâ€™s intentions, Dr. Habermeier would have properly communicated â€œhis pathological diagnosis and thoughts, to the rareness of his findings, so that the diagnosis could be used for the proper treatment of the patient at that moment.â€\r\nThe majority holds that there is nothing in the affidavit to suggest that it was unreasonable for Dr. Brusett to have removed part of the lung upon receiving the blastoma diagnosis.Â  I do not disagree; however, as I understand the Appellantsâ€™ theory, they allege a deviation from the standard of care in the communications between the surgeon and the pathologist, not in the surgical decision made upon receipt of the pathology report.Â  In my opinion, the reasonableness of Dr. Brusettâ€™s decision is not relevant to the summary judgment motion.\r\nThe majority also affirms, without discussion, the trial courtâ€™s holding that Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit failed to establish his familiarity with the standard of care.Â  I would hold that Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit indicating proficiency in the specialty involved, coupled with the statement â€œ It is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that each of these Defendants deviated from the acceptable standard of care and were negligent . . . in the following particulars . . . .â€ is sufficient to establish that he is familiar with the standard of care. \r\nIn my opinion, the trial court erred in holding that Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit did not demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact whether one or both physicians committed malpractice in failing to adequately communicate before and during the biopsy.Â  See, e.g., Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004) (summary judgment is drastic remedy that should be cautiously invoked).Â  I would therefore reverse the orders granting Respondents Brusett and Habermeier and their groups summary judgment.Â  I would affirm the grant of summary judgment to McLeod, however, because there is simply no evidence in this record that the Appellants looked to the hospital rather than to the individual doctors for Mrs. Davisâ€™s care.Â  Osborne v. McLeod Reg. Med. Center, 346 S.C. 4, 550 S.E.2d 319 (2001) (in order to hold hospital vicariously liable for staff negligence, plaintiff must present evidence that she looked to the hospital for care).\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] The evidence in this case suggests that the tissue removed for diagnosis unfortunately proved difficult to analyze.Â  The sample was so strange that after determining that the tissue was not cancerous, the pathologist sent the sample to the Department of Defense, who replied â€œ[w]hile the endometroid glandular architecture would cause one to consider the possibility of pulmonary blastoma, the histology is completely compatible with a diagnosis of endometriomaâ€¦[t]hank you for sending this interesting case.â€Â  \r\n[2] Specifically, Respondents filed three motions for summary judgment: (1) McLeod Regional, (2) Dr. Brusett and Pee Dee Cardiovascular Surgeons, and (3) Dr. Habermeier and Pee Dee Pathology.Â  The Respondentsâ€™ briefs to this Court were submitted in this fashion as well.\r\n[3] Initially, Appellant named only one expert in her response to interrogatories:Â  Dr. Hossein Tirgan, an oncologist in the state of New Jersey.Â  Dr. Tirgan, by way of affidavit and deposition, opined that all Respondents were negligent in some manner. The trial court found that Dr. Tirgan was not qualified to render an expert opinion in this case, and Appellant did not appeal that ruling.Â  \r\nAppellant named Dr. Frist as an expert only two days before the summary judgment hearing.Â  Respondents had no opportunity to depose Dr. Frist.Â  As a result, the only evidence that the trial court had to consider was Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit.Â  Therefore, we focus solely on Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit to determine whether summary judgment was proper.\r\n[4] I note with concern that the majority opinion could be read to import the medical malpractice plaintiffâ€™s evidentiary burden at trial into the summary judgment standard. Durham v. Vinson, Pederson v. Gould, Cox v, Lund, and Green v. Lilliewood are all appeals from cases that went to trial, and which decide whether the plaintiff had met her burden at that proceeding.Â  A motion for summary judgment is not a mini-trial, requiring the medical malpractice plaintiff to present evidence meeting her trial burden.Â  We are concerned here with the sufficiency of Dr. Fristâ€™s affidavit, and not with whether â€œthe evidence as a whole [meets] the criteria laid out in PedersonÂ  and its progeny [sic].â€Â  See Schulz v. Esposito, 210 A.D.2d 307, 308, 619 N.Y.S.2d 744, 775 (1994)(â€œIssue finding rather than issue determination is the key [to summary judgment]â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26100","title":"In the Matter of Newberry County Magistrate Mark E.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nMark E. English, of Newberry, pro se.Â Â Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of an admonition, public reprimand, or a definite suspension for thirty (30) days pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAt the time of the submission of the agreement and, on the occasion of the occurrences discussed hereafter, respondent was a Newberry County magistrate.Â  Respondent has since tendered his resignation as a Newberry County Magistrate effective at midnight on December 31, 2005.Â  \r\nMatter I\r\nFor quite some time and long prior to respondentâ€™s magisterial appointment, it was standard practice in the Newberry County Magistrateâ€™s Court for a representative of the Sheriffâ€™s Department to appear at bench trials in criminal cases in lieu of the appearance of the arresting officer and/or complaining witness(es) and to have the Sheriffâ€™s Department representative (who had no first hand knowledge of the case) testify for the State by reading the information from the incident report.Â  If the defendant contested the charge, the case would be continued until the arresting officer and/or the complaining witness(es) could be present.[1]Â  Respondent represents he followed the procedure described above as it was used by his predecessors and other Newberry County magistrates.Â  \r\nAfter discussing the Newberry County Magistrate Courtâ€™s procedure and related legal principles with ODC, respondent now recognizes that the Magistrateâ€™s Court was, in effect, depriving pro se defendants of the constitutionally guaranteed right to confront their accusers.Â  Respondent warrants that, in the future, he will cease allowing defendants to plead guilty or be convicted solely on the basis of incident reports.\r\nODC does not contend that it is judicial misconduct for a judge to allow hearsay testimony into a proceeding where there is no objection, even in cases where a defendant is pro se, but, instead, contends that fundamental principles of jurisprudence require some admissible evidence of the commission of a crime as a prerequisite to proceeding with a criminal case.Â  In addition, ODC contends Magistrateâ€™s Court should not accommodate the prosecution and deprive pro se defendants of basic constitutional rights.Â  \r\nThe Court emphasizes that while a criminal defendant may plead guilty without any evidence of his guilt being submitted, a defendant who pleads not guilty cannot be convicted solely on the basis of a police incident report.Â  The burden is on the government to prove a defendantâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on competent evidence.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent terminated an employee due to her being unable to satisfactorily perform her duties as a result of personal, domestic difficulties.Â  After notice of termination, respondent continued to pay the employee for several weeks for â€œaccumulated sick leaveâ€ even though no evidence of illness was presented to respondent.Â  Respondent signed or caused to be signed the employeeâ€™s name to a time sheet submitted for payment of the sick leave.Â  The actual document from respondent to Newberry County memorializing the termination was not transmitted until the sick leave had been exhausted. \r\nRespondent now recognizes that the right to sick leave did not continue after the employeeâ€™s termination, particularly in the absence of medical documentation supporting illness and that, at a minimum, he should have printed the employeeâ€™s name, not had it signed in cursive to indicate the former employee had signed the document.[2]Â  Respondent recognizes that the signing of another personâ€™s name in cursive to a time sheet and paying sick leave to a terminated employee who might or might not have been sick constituted judicial misconduct.[3]Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent loaned a motor vehicle to the same employee mentioned above while she was an employee of the Newberry County Central System.[4]Â  While driving the vehicle, the employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident and was issued a traffic citation by a South Carolina Highway Patrol trooper.Â  The citation charged her with driving too fast for conditions.Â  \r\nRespondent asked the charging trooper if he could â€œhelpâ€ the employee with the ticket as respondent believed the fine should have been suspended due to the fact that the employee was â€œa court employee who assisted troopers daily.â€ According to respondent, the charging trooper indicated he was unwilling to â€œhelpâ€ the employee with the ticket at that juncture because of the high visibility of the case, the known relationship between respondent and the employee,[5] existing animosity between respondent and another Newberry County Magistrate, Magistrate Beckham, and the fact that the motor vehicle the employee was driving was owned by respondent.Â  The trooper offered to continue the matter and revisit its disposition if circumstances made doing so less subject to criticism.[6]Â  The employee paid the fine marked on the ticket and respondent â€œsigned offâ€ on the ticket, causing it to be processed in a routine fashion.Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes it was judicial misconduct to have had an ex parte communication with the charging trooper and to even suggest the trooper â€œhelpâ€ the employee.Â  Respondent further recognizes that employees of the judicial system or law enforcement are not any more entitled to â€œhelpâ€ by virtue of their positions than other defendants and should, instead, be treated the same as any other person charged with an offense.Â  Â \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent received a traffic citation for driving too fast for conditions.Â  The ticket was issued by a South Carolina Highway Patrol trooper as a result of a motor vehicle accident.Â  The ticket was returnable before Magistrate Rushton.Â  Respondent felt he was not at fault and planned to contest the ticket.Â  \r\nWhen the case was called to be heard before Magistrate Rushton, respondent entered a plea of not guilty.Â  No witness appeared and the trooper announced that he did not wish to proceed with the prosecution without witnesses present since he did not witness the accident.Â  Magistrate Rushton ruled the matter should be dismissed and/or found respondent not guilty on the date of trial.Â Â  \r\nMagistrate Rushton â€œsigned offâ€ so as to indicate â€œdismissedâ€ or â€œnot guiltyâ€ on the copy of the ticket sent to the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and on the trooperâ€™s copy of the ticket.Â  However, the court record copy of the ticket could not be located until several months after Magistrate Rushton had ceased being a magistrate. \r\nRespondent felt it was necessary to cause the court records to conform to the DMV records.Â  For that reason, respondent telephoned Magistrate Rushton and Magistrate Rushton authorized that his name be â€œsigned offâ€ on the courtâ€™s copy of the ticket.Â  Respondent then instructed the employee mentioned above to sign Magistrate Rushtonâ€™s name on the ticket showing it as â€œnot guiltyâ€ and/or â€œdismissedâ€ (as it should have originally been marked by Magistrate Rushton had it been available on the trial date).Â  However, Magistrate Rushton was not present when the court copy of the ticket was signed and, in fact, was no longer a magistrate on that occasion. \r\nRespondent now recognizes it was judicial misconduct to authorize the employee to sign Magistrate Rushtonâ€™s name (even with his permission and only to conform to the actual disposition of the ticket) because a directive from the Chief Justice concerning the â€œsigning offâ€ of tickets only allows court employees to sign a judgeâ€™s name on traffic tickets in the judgeâ€™s presence.Â  Respondent recognizes the correct procedure would have been to have Magistrate Ruston sign the court copy nunc pro tunc or, at least, mark it â€œs/Rushton [printed]â€ indicating it was being conformed to the original, rather than suggesting Magistrate Rushton had actually signed the ticket or that someone with his authority had signed it in his presence while he was a judge.Â  Respondent now recognizes that, with very few exceptions, no one can sign a judgeâ€™s name to legal documents. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nMoreover, the employee dated the court copy of the ticket as of the date of the trial (which would have been the date on the DMV and trooperâ€™s copies of the ticket).Â  Respondent explains that the trial date is generally used by Newberry County magistrates when they â€œsign offâ€ a ticket, regardless of the date on which the ticket is actually â€œsigned off.â€Â  ODC does not contest respondentâ€™s representation in this regard but provides the better practice would have been to place the notation â€œSee reverseâ€ by Magistrate Rushtonâ€™s printed name and place an explanation and the actual â€œsign offâ€ date on the reverse of the ticket.Â  \r\nODC acknowledges respondent gained no advantage as a result of this matter.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nMatter V\r\nA defendant was charged with driving under the influence.Â  The defendant hired an attorney who filed a written request for a jury trial.Â  The writing was placed in the courtâ€™s case file.Â  Notwithstanding the appearance of the attorney, the matter was scheduled for trial, but the attorney was not notified.Â  \r\nThe arresting officer, the defendant, and defense attorney were not present when the case was called for trial.Â  Respondent directed the officer be located.Â  The trial was delayed and the officer was given the opportunity to appear.Â  The officer advised respondent he was not in court when the case was called for trial because he had not been notified of the trial date.Â  No similar effort was made to locate the defendant or to give the defendant an opportunity to be present.Â  The defendant was convicted in his absence.Â  In a later meeting with the defense attorney and the arresting officer it was determined that the defense attorney had not been notified of the trial and respondent, on motion of the defense attorney with consent of the arresting officer, reopened the matter. \r\nRespondent now recognizes that any disparate treatment afforded the State and the accused gives an appearance of impropriety and suggests a bias towards the State.Â  In the future, respondent represents he will be make equal effort to locate absent defendants and absent law enforcement officers.Â  In addition, he represents he will be more careful to determine whether or not defendants are represented by counsel and, if so, give notice to counsel of upcoming proceedings.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nA vending machine is operated in the lobby of the Newberry County Central Court for use by employees and the public.Â  The machine is under respondentâ€™s supervision. The profits from the vending machine are applied to a canteen fund and used for miscellaneous office expenses such as flowers for employees who are sick or suffer losses of loved ones and social events to promote camaraderie among the staff at the Central Court.Â  \r\nWhile this is a fairly minor matter, ODC contends the practice is contrary to the general laws of the State which require that all income from the State and its political subdivisions be paid over to the county treasurer and that the only expenditures that may be made by public officials are those authorized in an annual budget approved by the governing body of the jurisdiction.Â  In addition, ODC contends use of the vending machine proceeds is contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of prohibitions in published cases of the Supreme Court of South Carolina and subsequent memorandums of the Chief Justice relating to judges using their position to collect money.Â  \r\nRespondent explains it is a common practice for the various departments of Newberry County to use vending machine profits for similar purposes and that no objection had been raised by any officials of the county prior to the complaint here. Â ODC does not dispute respondentâ€™s representation and concedes the infraction is well intended and follows a general practice in the various departments in Newberry County and possibly across the State.Â  Nevertheless, ODC contends it is contrary to the statutory laws of this State. Â Respondent does not dispute this contention.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nWhen defendants failed to appear for traffic court and did not post bond, respondent would try the defendants in their absence, issue bench warrants, and send the NRVC notice to the DMV.[7]Â  In addition, respondent would either draw or cause to be drawn warrants charging the defendants with violation of South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-25-40 (1991) and then have a Sheriffâ€™s Department deputy sign a supporting affidavit.Â  \r\nODC agrees that the failure to post bond or appear on the date of trial does, in fact, constitute a violation of Section 56-25-40 but contends it is the duty of law enforcement or prosecutors to seek the issuance of warrants, not judges.Â  ODC contends judges should only issue warrants when approached by victims, law enforcement, or prosecutors presenting sufficient evidence for the issuance of warrants.Â Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes that, except in the case of contempt of court, it is judicial misconduct for a judge to initiate criminal charges.Â  However, in mitigation, respondent represents the practice of issuing warrants was initiated at the request of the Newberry County Sheriffâ€™s Department and that, prior to issuing these warrants, an employee of Court Administration advised him that he could issue warrants under these circumstances.Â  Respondent asserts he issued only a few such warrants and immediately ceased the practice upon receipt of a complaint regarding the matter. \r\nODC does not dispute respondentâ€™s representations.Â  The Court Administration employee confirms respondentâ€™s representation but states he did not intend to suggest warrants should be issued sua sponte.Â  ODC contends magistrates should not draw warrants sua sponte and then seek to have a law enforcement officer sign the warrant affidavit.Â  Instead, ODC asserts such warrants should be issued when an affiant with knowledge of a case appears before a judge seeking a warrant for the offense and gives an affidavit setting out probable cause.Â  \r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondentâ€™s friend was charged with having an expired license tag on his motor vehicle. The friend did not appear at trial, but the records of the proceedings were marked â€œsuspend fine as per [respondent].â€ \r\nÂ Respondent does not recall the exact details of this event; however, he represents that such a disposition was typical as Newberry County Magistrates suspended fines after defendants demonstrated that they had acquired license tags.Â  Respondent states this procedure is fair since citizens often have problems obtaining tags from DMV in a timely fashion.Â  Nevertheless, respondent acknowledges that, since his friend did not appear for trial, he either received information about his friend obtaining his license tag in an ex parte fashion or suspended the fine without knowing for certain that the tag had been obtained.Â  \r\nMatter IX\r\nRespondent released approximately nine (9) prisoners from the Newberry County Detention Center without any legal basis for doing so except for his own decision that this was necessary.Â  These prisoners were serving sentences, many of which were imposed by other judges, including one serving a sentence imposed by a family court judge.Â  Respondent represents he released these prisoners at the request of law enforcement because the detention center was being renovated and the adjoining county could not accommodate all the prisoners incarcerated at the Newberry County Detention Center.Â  Respondent further represents he reviewed each of the prisonerâ€™s sentences and released those with the shortest sentences remaining and only those he felt were non-violent.Â  \r\nODC does not contest respondentâ€™s representations concerning this matter and acknowledges that respondentâ€™s intentions were good and had a rational basis.Â  However, respondent now acknowledges that, absent legal proceedings and appropriate authorization, he lacked authority to release the prisoners notwithstanding the countyâ€™s problems in holding them while the detention center was being renovated.Â  \r\nMatter X\r\nWhile bond hearings are scheduled two (2) times per day in the Newberry County Central Court in accordance with the direction of the Chief Justice dated November 28, 2000, it is the practice of respondent and other magistrates in Newberry County to hold special, unscheduled bond hearings in the interval between the scheduled bond hearings, making the scheduled bond hearings often unnecessary.Â  Respondent represents that, when the special bond hearings are held, they are held for the entire detention center population in need of a bond hearing and not to benefit any special defendants.Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes this practice may not fully conform to the directives of the Chief Justice concerning the conduct of bond hearings.Â  In the future, respondent will promptly familiarize himself with the Chief Justiceâ€™s directive and, thereafter, follow it to the letter or seek permission for a variance in procedures from the Chief Justice.Â  \r\nMatter XI\r\nMatthew Boland (Matthew) was charged by a South Carolina Highway Patrol trooper with driving 85 mph in a 55 mph speed zone.Â  When the case was called for trial before respondent, Matthew was not present; no bond had been posted on his behalf.Â  The trooper was present.Â  Respondent proceeded to find Matthew guilty in his absence, made the notations â€œ$425â€ (indicative of the amount of the fine imposed) and â€œNRVC,â€ and had the ticket sent to the DMV.Â  Because of the NRVC notation and $425 fine, the DMV wrote Matthew advising him that his driverâ€™s license had been suspended due to his failure to appear at trial or to post bond.\r\nUnknown to respondent, Matthew was under the impression he did not need to appear at trial and that the ticket would be marked â€œnot guiltyâ€ in his absence.Â  Respondent reports that Magistrate Beckham later learned Matthew had been found guilty in his absence and sent word to respondent that the â€œGeneral Attorneyâ€ had wanted the ticket marked â€œnot guilty.â€ Â Respondent represents the remark remains clear in his mind because of the reference to â€œGeneral Attorneyâ€ rather than the proper reference to â€œAttorney General.â€Â  \r\nODC asserts, and respondent does not dispute, that, prior to the date of trial, Matthewâ€™s father (Mr. Boland) called attorney William Franklin â€œTroupâ€ Partridge, III (Troup) about the ticket. Troup referred the matter to his father, William Franklin Partridge, Jr., (Frank), an attorney practicing in Newberry County.Â  At a regularly scheduled lunch meeting, Frank told Magistrate Beckham (his son-in-law) that Frank needed to talk with the trooper about Matthewâ€™s ticket.Â  Magistrate Beckham conveyed the message to the trooper who, according to Magistrate Beckham, responded â€œtell Frank not to worry about that ticketâ€ or words to that effect.Â  Somehow Matthew came to believe he did not need to appear or post bond in connection with the ticket.Â  For purposes of this agreement, respondent does not contest these findings.Â  Â \r\nRespondent advises it was common practice in the Newberry County Central Court for the charging officer to fill in the information on tickets after magistrateâ€™s court was concluded based on the rulings of the hearing magistrate.Â  To respondentâ€™s best knowledge, the trooper incorrectly filled out the information on Matthewâ€™s ticket after trial by checking the â€œappearedâ€ block (when Matthew did not appear) and â€œnot guiltyâ€ (when respondent had, in open court, found Matthew guilty as charged).Â Â Â  \r\nODC has further determined:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        -\r\n         Mr. Boland called Troup after receiving notice of Matthewâ€™s license suspension from the DMV;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        -\r\n         Troup called Magistrate Beckham (his brother-in-law) and obtained information from the records of the central magistrateâ€™s court indicating respondent had found Matthew â€œguiltyâ€ and obtained copies of the Courtâ€™s records (which indicates some confusion on the disposition of the ticket);\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        -\r\n         Troup then telephoned respondent, purportedly to inquire as to the status of the ticket based on the records of the Newberry County Central Court;[8]\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        -\r\n         respondent checked the records and advised Troup that the records indicated Matthew had been found â€œguiltyâ€ in his absence;Â Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        -\r\n         Troup then told respondent that the ticket was supposed to have been marked â€œnot guiltyâ€ and had been sent to the DMV in error;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        -\r\n         respondent told Troup that, in his judgment, there was no error, that Matthew had not appeared or posted bond, and that he was not going to change his ruling; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        -\r\n         respondent reports that, in the telephone conversation, Troup told him something to the effect that â€œwe will just have to file a Writ of Mandamusâ€ (emphasis in original).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nODC has further determined: \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      -\r\n       Frank prepared legal pleadings, including an order for a Rule to Show Cause requiring respondent to appear at a hearing before Circuit Court Judge Wyatt Saunders the next business day;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      -\r\n       Judge Saunders reports he has been unable to determine how those pleadings came to be in his office and were left on his desk by an unknown person;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      -\r\n       Troup is Judge Saundersâ€™ former law clerk and, coincidentally (according to both Troup and Judge Saunders), dropped by Judge Saundersâ€™ chambers prior to the closing of the courthouse just to â€œsay helloâ€ to Judge Saunders the same day Judge Saunders signed the Rule to Show Cause order;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      -\r\n       Judge Saunders asked Troup to have the pleadings served on respondent;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      -\r\n       Sheriff Lee Foster reported he received a telephone call from Troup (whom Sheriff Foster knew personally and was aware of his employment by the State of South Carolina) who stated the Attorney General wanted the pleadings served on respondent that evening;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      -\r\n       Sheriff Foster dispatched a deputy sheriff to Frankâ€™s house, picked up the pleadings there from Troup, and had a deputy sheriff serve them on respondent; and\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      -\r\n       the pleadings required respondent to appear before Judge Saunders the next business day to show cause why Matthewâ€™s tickets should not be changed to â€œnot guilty.â€ [9] \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAlthough he prepared the pleadings, Frank did not appear at the hearing before Judge Saunders.Â  Matthew appeared pro se, along with his father.Â  Respondent also appeared pro se.Â  Judge Saunders did not ask Matthew if he appeared for trial or why he believed he would be found â€œnot guilty.â€Â  The transcript from the proceeding indicates Matthew â€œcould not rememberâ€ who had given him copies of the materials presented to the circuit court.Â  Judge Saunders asked respondent if it would be proper to â€œoffer this citizen a trial.â€Â  In response, respondent stated he was willing to â€œhelpâ€ Matthew.Â  Judge Saunders noted that pleadings did not bear any docket number and stated on the record that respondent â€œis willing to assist youâ€ and volunteered that the circuit court was acting â€œno different in this than it would in other similar matters.â€Â  \r\nAfter the case was recessed, respondent, Matthew, and Mr. Boland went into the hallway to discuss the matter.Â  Judge Saunders asked the trooperâ€™s supervisor who was also present in the courthouse for other purposes to participate in the discussion between respondent, Matthew, and Mr. Boland.Â  The supervisor agreed that the 85/55 mph ticket (a six point ticket) against Matthew would be reduced to a two point violation (speeding under 10 miles over the posted limit) and the fine would be reduced in accordance with the reduced charges.Â  Judge Saunders was advised the matter had been resolved and, thereafter, caused the records to reflect that Matthew had been convicted, pled guilty, or forfeited bond to a charge of speeding under 10 miles over the posted limit. \r\nThe very next day, Matthew appeared before respondent, accompanied by Frank, on two additional traffic charges.Â  Respondent reduced these charges to â€œhelpâ€ Matthew because of Matthewâ€™s increasingly poor driving record.Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes it was judicial misconduct to negotiate a settlement with a defendant and his father even if encouraged to do so by the circuit court judge and even in the presence of and with the consent of the trooperâ€™s supervisor.Â  Respondent has represented to ODC under oath that he did not feel any pressure by the circuit court judge but, instead, just wanted to â€œhelpâ€ Matthew because of the obvious difficulties he would face due to the traffic tickets. \r\nRespondent has been fully cooperative with ODCâ€™s inquiries in this and all other matters addressed herein and has amended his procedures to conform with applicable guidelines as he now understands them to be.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2B (judge shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the judge's judicial conduct or judgment); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3(B)(2)Â  (judge shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it; judge shall not be swayed by public clamor or fear of criticism); Canon 3B(7) (judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider\r\nex  parte  communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending proceeding); and Canon 3B(8) (judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently, and fairly).Â  Respondent admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to willfully violate a valid court order issued by a court of this State) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp; Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Because respondent no longer holds his magisterial position, a public reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court can impose for the misconduct addressed in this opinion.Â  See In re Oâ€™Kelley, 361 S.C. 30, 603 S.E.2d 410 (2004); In re Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996).Â  Due to the gravity of respondentâ€™s misconduct, he shall no longer serve in any judicial capacity in this state without the Courtâ€™s permission.Â  Respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1]The Newberry County Magistrateâ€™s Court recognized that, if the defendant was represented by counsel, counsel would likely offer a hearsay objection to the admission of information in the incident report (unless the report was introduced by the officer who prepared the report) and the objection would have to be sustained.Â  \r\n[2] Respondent represents he had permission to sign the employeeâ€™s name to the time sheet and that his actions were taken with the acquiescence of and/or instructions from county administrative personnel.\r\n[3] Respondent is romantically involved with the employee. Respondent and the employee have testified under oath that their romantic involvement did not take place until after the employee ceased to be an employee of the Newberry County Central Court System.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[4] Respondent represents the employee was making payments on the vehicle in return for its use.Â  Â Â \r\n[5] See Footnote 3.\r\n[6] Respondent represents he would not have normally discussed the matter with the trooper, but the trooperâ€™s supervisor advised respondent that he felt the ticket should be dismissed and was going to direct the trooper to do so.Â  \r\n[7] â€œNRVCâ€ is the standard notation to indicate the defendant failed to appear or post bond and the administrative process should suspend the defendantâ€™s driverâ€™s license in accordance with applicable law.Â  \r\n[8] ODC does not contend that respondentâ€™s conversation with Troup was an improper ex parte conversation inasmuch as respondent entered into the conversation with Troup only to discuss the status of the ticket, an administrative matter.Â Â  \r\n[9] Respondent has no direct knowledge of many of the conclusions in this list but, for purposes of this agreement, does not dispute them.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Robert Lee Newton, Jr.,","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2006-01-17-01","description":"This is an order reinstating an attorney to the practice of law.","date":"2006-01-23","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Robert Lee Newton, Jr., Petitioner.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nOn November 8, 2004, petitioner was suspended from the practice of law for one year, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Newton, 361 S.C. 404, 605 S.E.2d 538 (2004).Â  By order dated October 19, 2005, the Court granted petitionerâ€™s Petition for Reinstatement subject to two conditions.Â  Petitioner has now complied with the two conditions.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney\r\nGeneral Donald J. Zelenka, and Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, of Columbia, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Robert Lee Nance (Petitioner), sentenced to death for murder, appealed from the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s denial of his application for relief.Â  This Court held that the manner in which Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel investigated, planned, and conducted his defense constituted a classic example of a complete breakdown in the adversarial process.Â  As a result, this Court granted Petitioner a new trial.Â  However, the United States Supreme Court vacated this Courtâ€™s judgment and remanded this case for consideration in light of Florida v. Nixon.[1]\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nThe facts surrounding the incident are not in dispute and are outlined in this Courtâ€™s previous opinion:\r\n\r\nThe victims, Robert and Violet Fraley, were attacked at home where they lived alone.[2]Â  On the night of the intrusion, Mr. Fraley testified that he and his wife went to bed around 9:30 or 10:00 p.m.Â  Mr. Fraley awoke to the sound of someone knocking on the front door of the house.Â  Mr. Fraley testified that he saw a man standing on the porch, and that the man asked him if he could come in to use the phone because his truck had broken down.Â  Mr. Fraley told him he could use the phone outside in his shop.Â  When the man said he did not have a light to see his way to the shed, Mr. Fraley left the door to get him a flashlight.Â  Mr. Fraley testified that when he unlatched the door to hand over the light, the man forced the door open and immediately began stabbing him with a screwdriver.\r\nAt some point, Mrs. Fraley entered the room and tried to help Mr. Fraley as he tried unsuccessfully to get away from the intruder.Â  Mr. Fraley was bleeding profusely and his wife was trying to wipe up blood while the intruder was demanding money and the keys to their car.Â  Mrs. Fraley retrieved both of their wallets and their keys and gave approximately $194 in cash and the keys to the intruder.Â  Mr. Fraley testified that he pleaded with the intruder not to kill him and his wife, but that the intruder replied that he was going to kill both of them.Â  The intruder then raped and killed Mrs. Fraley.Â  Miraculously, Mr. Fraley survived the attack but was hospitalized for thirteen days.Â  \r\nPetitioner was arrested in the early morning hours following the attack after he was pulled over driving the Fraleysâ€™ Cadillac.Â  There was blood on his clothes that was later determined to be Mrs. Fraleyâ€™s.Â  The car also contained a bank envelope that was taken from the Fraleysâ€™ home during the attack.Â  Two people were in the car with Petitioner when he was stopped.Â  One person fled the scene and was never apprehended.Â  The other person, Erskine Green, testified at Petitionerâ€™s trial that he did not know Petitioner and that Petitioner had picked him and the other man up on the side of the road.Â  \r\n\r\nPetitioner was convicted of murder, criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the first degree, first-degree burglary, assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), and armed robbery.Â  He was sentenced to death on the murder charge.Â  He was also sentenced to life for burglary, thirty years for CSC, twenty years for ABIK, and twenty-five years for armed robbery.Â  His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal.Â  State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996).Â  Subsequently, Petitioner filed a PCR application.Â  The PCR court denied relief and Petitioner appealed. \r\nThis Court granted relief relying on United States v. Cronic[3] because Petitioner did not receive effective assistance of counsel due to the failure of counsel to challenge the prosecutionâ€™s case against Petitioner.Â  Nance v. Frederick, 358 S.C. 480, 596 S.E.2d 62 (2004).Â  The Court held that the case represented â€œa classic Cronic ineffectiveness case, falling under the second Cronic scenario because there was a total breakdown in the adversarial process during both the guilt phase and penalty phase of Petitionerâ€™s trial.â€Â  Id. at 488, 596 S.E.2d at 66.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court vacated this Courtâ€™s judgment and remanded the case in light of Florida v. Nixon.Â  In Nixon, the Court held that presumed prejudice as outlined by Cronic is reserved for cases in which counsel fails to meaningfully oppose the prosecutionâ€™s case.Â  Nixon, 543 U.S. at ___.Â  Accordingly, the following issue is presented to this Court for review:\r\nWhat is the impact of Florida v. Nixon on this case?\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nCronic and Strickland\r\nPetitioner argues that this Court should hold that counsel was ineffective and grant relief.Â  We agree. \r\nÂ â€œThe very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.â€Â  Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862 (1975).Â  \r\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees that every criminal defendant shall receive â€œAssistance of Counselâ€ in establishing his defense.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  On May 14, 1984, the United States Supreme Court handed down two opinions holding that the Sixth Amendment requires that a criminal defendant receive effective assistance of counsel.Â  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).\r\nÂ  Strickland and Cronic are companion cases applying the same analysis, but with a different emphasis.Â  Both Strickland and Cronic direct that a defendant must ordinarily make two showings in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim.Â  â€œFirst, the defendant must show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient.â€Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 666 (explaining that absent specific â€œcircumstances mak[ing] it unlikely that the defendant could have received the effective assistance,â€ he can make out an ineffective assistance claim â€œonly by pointing to specific errors made by trial counselâ€).Â  This requires the defendant to demonstrate that â€œcounsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.â€Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-88; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 666 n. 41 (noting that â€œclaims based on specified errors ... should be evaluated under the standards enunciated in Stricklandâ€).Â  â€œSecond the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.Â  This requires showing that counselâ€™s errors were so serious as to deprive the\r\ndefendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.â€Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.\r\nThe Supreme Court also recognized in both Strickland and Cronic that in certain circumstances â€œprejudice is presumedâ€ because prejudice â€œis so likely that case-by-case inquiry ... is not worth the cost.â€Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692 (citing Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658).Â  In Cronic, the Court identified three distinct situations in which a presumption of prejudice is appropriate.Â  First, prejudice is presumed when the defendant is completely denied counsel â€œat a critical stage of his trial.â€Â  Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659.Â  Second, per-se prejudice occurs if there has been a constructive denial of counsel.Â  This happens when a lawyer â€œentirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing,â€ thus making â€œthe adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.â€ Id.Â  Third, the Court identified certain instances â€œwhen although counsel is available to assist the accused during trial, the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial.â€Â  Id.Â  (citing Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932)).Â  A finding of per-se prejudice under any of these three prongs is â€œan extremely high showing for a criminal defendant to make.â€Â  Brown v. French, 147 F.3d 307, 313 (4th Cir. 1998).\r\nAbsent these narrow circumstances of presumed prejudice under\r\nCronic, defendants must show actual prejudice under Strickland. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 666 and n. 41.Â  Actual prejudice requires the defendant to â€œshow that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.Â  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.â€Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\r\nFlorida v. Nixon reaffirmed the notion that per-se prejudice occurs infrequently.Â  In Nixon, the United States Supreme Court held that entering a guilty plea on behalf of a defendant without his express consent did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  Nixon, 543 U.S. at ___.Â  The Court opined that the decision to plead guilty was a strategy employed by trial counsel in an effort to present mitigating evidence at sentencing in an attempt to save the defendantâ€™s life.Â  Id. atÂ  ___.Â  Further, the Court held that Cronicâ€™s presumed prejudice standard was only used for those cases where counsel fails to â€œfunction in any meaningful sense as the Governmentâ€™s adversary.â€Â  Id. at ___. \r\nIn light of the recent holding in Nixon, we believe the present case represents one of the rare cases where counsel â€œentirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.â€Â  Moreover, counsel did not act as an adversary to the prosecutionâ€™s case, but instead helped to bolster the case against his client.\r\nThis Courtâ€™s previous opinion set forth the following in an effort to detail the deficiencies in counselâ€™s representation:Â  \r\nTrial Presentation\r\n\r\nFollowing Petitionerâ€™s arrest, defense counsel was appointed as Petitionerâ€™s lead counsel.Â  At the time he was appointed, defense counsel had either recently suffered from or was then suffering from pneumonia, gout, ulcers, diabetes, alcoholism, and congestive heart failure.Â  During the trial he was taking various prescription medications, including Valium, Lopressor, Isocet, and Tenormin.Â  At the PCR hearing, Petitionerâ€™s experts testified that the side effects of those medications included impaired memory, lack of sleep, and sedation.Â  Defense counselâ€™s testimony at the PCR hearing indicated that he remembered very little from the trial that took place 5 years before the PCR hearing.Â  \r\nAn attorney, who had only been practicing law for eighteen months, was appointed as co-counsel.Â  Co-counsel testified at the PCR hearing that Petitionerâ€™s mother was the only family member who was interviewed prior to trial; that he did not recall that anyone investigated Petitionerâ€™s background; and that no one had requested Petitionerâ€™s records from the Department of Corrections. \r\nThe psychologist who planned to offer expert testimony concerning Petitionerâ€™s mental health, Dr. Dewitt (Dewitt), asked defense counsel for Petitionerâ€™s medical records, social history, statements from family members, and statements from the Department of Corrections staff but never received them.Â  He received Petitionerâ€™s hospital records a few hours before trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuilt Phase\r\n\r\nWhen introducing himself in his opening statement to the jury, co-counsel said, â€œI did not ask [to represent the Petitioner], I was simply appointed.Â  [defense counsel], as the public defender, did not ask for this case either.Â  He was just appointed to represent Mr. Nance.â€Â  In addition, defense counsel presented only three witnesses to testify on behalf of Petitionerâ€™s defense: a corrections officer, an unqualified expert, and Petitionerâ€™s sister.\r\nDefense counselâ€™s first witness, a Florence County detention center officer, testified that while in prison, Petitioner threw urine at a female corrections officer.[4]Â Â  On cross-examination, the officer testified that this episode was Petitionerâ€™s only incident of misbehavior during the seven-month period that Petitioner was under his watch.\r\nThe defenseâ€™s second witness, Dewitt, testified about Petitionerâ€™s mental health. Based on only two meetings with the Petitioner, Dewitt opined that Petitioner more closely resembled a criminal who was guilty but mentally ill.Â  Defense counsel was not successful in qualifying Dewitt as an expert.\r\nThe defense rested after Dewittâ€™s testimony.Â  The trial judge then granted defense counselâ€™s request to reopen his presentation so that Petitionerâ€™s sister could testify.Â  Defense counsel failed to prepare the sisterâ€™s testimony but asked that she testify about Petitionerâ€™s childhood.Â  The sister testified that Petitioner was an abnormal child: pretending to be an undertaker, he buried one of his brothers; pulled a gun on their father; stabbed himself with a broken bottle; and killed their pets. \r\nIn sum, the testimony that defense counsel presented in Petitionerâ€™s guilt phase defense consisted of testimony of a corrections officer concerning the only incident of misconduct that Petitioner committed while incarcerated; an opinion by an uninformed psychiatrist who was not qualified as an expert; and unprepared testimony of Petitionerâ€™s sister about Petitionerâ€™s oddities as a child.\r\n\r\nSentencing Phase\r\n\r\nDefense counselâ€™s mitigation presentation during the sentencing phase of the trial lasted seven minutes.Â  Counsel began by waiving the opening statement and then incorporated the meager amount of defense testimony elicited during the guilt phase. Â \r\nDefense counsel then presented the testimony of a corrections officer of the Florence Detention Center, who testified that Petitioner was taking two prescription medications, Cogentin and Haldol, and that Petitioner had taken Haldol that morning.[5]Â  Counsel presented no further testimony, to which the trial judge responded by asking, â€œAre you ready to go to the jury?â€Â  Counsel responded, â€œWe incorporate what we feel, Your Honor -- the doctor and the other testimony by the sister would be repetitious.â€Â  The judge then replied, â€œDo you need any time to collect your thoughts?Â  This is rather quick.â€[6]Â  Co-counsel gave the closing argument, refusing to plead for Petitionerâ€™s life and referring to Petitioner as a â€œsickâ€ man who did â€œsick things.â€\r\nWe find that this trial presentation, in its entirety, represents a classic Cronic ineffectiveness case, falling under the second Cronic scenario because there was a total breakdown in the adversarial process during both the guilt phase and penalty phase of Petitionerâ€™s trial.Â  For the reasons set forth below, we presume Petitioner was prejudiced, and accordingly, grant him a new trial.\r\nFirst, Petitioner was disadvantaged from the outset because lead defense counsel was in ill health and on heavy medication, and co-counsel had only practiced law for eighteen months.Â Â  \r\nSecond, in aid of its claim that Petitioner was mentally ill, the defense had wanted Petitioner to appear in the courtroom in his natural demeanor, unaffected by the administration of psychotropic drugs.Â  The defense was successful in getting the trial judge to order such.Â  Nevertheless, defense counsel failed to inform the jail personnel of the trial judgeâ€™s order that Petitioner be taken off the anti-psychotic drug, Haldol. Consequently, Petitioner remained in a drug-influenced demeanor during the entire trial, and the jury never observed his natural demeanor.Â  \r\nThird, the trial had just begun when co-counsel communicated to the jury that neither he nor defense counsel wanted to be there.\r\nFourth, while defense counsel may have been pursuing a defense of guilty but mentally ill (GBMI),[7] he failed to qualify his own expert.Â  Further, by eliciting the unprepared testimony of Petitionerâ€™s sister only after defense psychologist Dewitt testified, defense counsel failed to give his unqualified expert, at minimum, the opportunity to inform the jury of how the sisterâ€™s testimony of Petitionerâ€™s mental irregularities as a child could lead to a conclusion that Petitioner was mentally ill at the time of the murder. \r\nFifth, defense counsel presented no adaptability evidence at the sentencing hearing.Â  In fact, by merely incorporating the testimony elicited from the guilt phase, defense counsel gave the impression that Petitioner had not adapted to confinement, because the only evidence that had been presented concerning his confinement was the urine-throwing incident.\r\nDuring the PCR hearing, Petitioner presented testimony to show that the urine-throwing incident was the only instance of bad behavior during confinement.Â  In fact, Petitioner was selected as the Manning Correctional Institutionâ€™s inmate of the year and was nominated for the Department of Correctionsâ€™ inmate of the year.Â  He also sang in the prison choir and participated in other Christian activities.Â  A jail administrator and prison minister testified that Petitioner was a model inmate.Â  Defense counsel could have easily discovered this adaptability evidence prior to trial but failed to do so.[8]\r\nSixth, defense counsel presented no mitigating social history evidence to explain the Petitionerâ€™s odd childhood behavior to which his sister referred to during the guilt phase.Â  Defense counsel failed to reveal that Petitioner was beaten throughout his childhood; his father was an alcoholic who fought with many family members; he was treated with alcohol as a child in lieu of over-the-counter medication; and he grew up in a family of extreme poverty and physical deprivation.Â  \r\nSeventh, defense counselâ€™s seven-minute mitigation presentation failed to provide the jury with any insight concerning Petitionerâ€™s mental illness.Â  At the PCR hearing, Petitioner introduced evidence that he has a family history of schizophrenia, he has a history of hearing voices in his head, and he has suffered neurological damage.Â  \r\nFinally, during the closing argument, co-counsel failed to plead for Petitionerâ€™s life and referred to him as a â€œsickâ€ man.\r\n\r\nNance, 358 S.C. at 485-88, 596 S.E.2d at 65-66.\r\nThe above outlined trial presentation details the complete failure to conduct a defense by trial counsel.Â  We hold that this case represents a very rare situation where counsel failed to provide an adversarial challenge to the prosecution.Â  We find it most compelling that in the present case counsel abandoned his role as defense counsel and in fact helped to bolster the case against his client.Â  In particular, counselâ€™s statement that his client was â€œa sick manâ€ who has done â€œsick thingsâ€ points to the fact that he was not acting as defense counsel and failed â€œto functionâ€¦ as the Governmentâ€™s adversary.â€Â  Â See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 758 (1983) (stating that in order to satisfy the Constitution, counsel must function as an advocate for the defendant, as opposed to a friend of the court); Ferri v. Ackerman, 444 U.S. 193, 204 (1979) (stating that an indispensable element of the effective performance of [defense counsel's] responsibilities is the ability to act independently of the Government and to oppose it in adversary litigation).Â  In addition, counsel called a defense witness who testified about Petitionerâ€™s one incident of misbehavior in jail.Â  Finally, Petitionerâ€™s sister testified as to his propensity for killing animals as a child.Â  These witnesses, in addition to counselâ€™s opening and closing statements, helped to further bolster the prosecutionâ€™s case against Petitioner rather than providing him with a defense.\r\nWe again recognize that this type of â€œconsistently inept form of lawyer conduct [is not] acceptable in this state, nor will we employ a prejudice analysis, for â€˜[defense] counselâ€™s ineffectiveness [is] so pervasive as to render a particularized prejudice inquiry unnecessary.â€™â€Â  Nance, 358 S.C. at 490, 596 S.E.2d at 67. (citing Frett v. State, 298 S.C. 54, 56, 378 S.E.2d 249, 251 (1988)).Â  As a result, we hold that counsel was ineffective under Cronic and failed to act as an adversary to the prosecution, but instead helped to reinforce the case against his client.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we again reverse the PCRâ€™s decision to deny relief after reconsideration of the issue in light of Florida v. Nixon. \r\n MOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, J.J., and Acting Justice James C. Williams\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] Florida v.

Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984).\r\n[4] At the PCR hearing, Petitionerâ€™s PCR counsel presented testimony that the reason why Petitioner threw urine at the female office was because she reminded him of his aunt.Â  \r\n[5] The trial judge forbade Petitioner from taking any antipsychotic drugs during trial.Â  Haldol is a very strong antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of acute schizophrenia and acute psychosis, controlling a patientâ€™s tendency towards aggression and agitation.Â  \r\nhttp://www.psyweb.com/Drughtm/halope.html \r\n[6] This is an example of the trial judgeâ€™s commendable attempt to insure that defense counsel was effectively representing his client.Â  Unfortunately, the trial judgeâ€™s ability to hold defense counsel to his constitutional obligation to effectively represent his client was greatly limited by (1) the desultory manner in which defense counsel tried this case and (2) the fact that at the time this case was tried, South Carolina common law provided little guidance as to what constituted an attorneyâ€™s complete failure to provide effective representation.Â  We hope that this opinion provides some clarity as to what does not constitute effective representation.Â  \r\n[7] Dewitt testified that Petitionerâ€™s mental incapacity did not rise to the level of the Mâ€™Naughten standard for insanity but did opine that he met the standard for GBMI.Â  Despite evidence of Petitionerâ€™s mental incapacity, defense counsel failed to raise the issue of whether Petitioner was competent to stand trial.Â  \r\n[8] The United States Supreme Court has recently recognized that defense counsel must conduct a reasonable investigation â€œto discover all reasonably available mitigation evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.â€Â  Wiggins v.

(Travelers) moved the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission to identify Petitioner United Heartland (United) as the insurer responsible for the claim of Willowglen Academy (Willowglen).Â  The single commissioner held United responsible.Â  The appellate panel of the commission affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding Travelers and United equally responsible.Â  The circuit court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding Travelers solely responsible.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding United solely responsible.Â  Avant v. Willowglen Academy, 356 S.C. 181, 588 S.E.2d 125 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion and now affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nTravelers insured Marty Avantâ€™s employer, Willowglen Academy, through an assigned-risk workersâ€™ compensation policy administered by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI).Â  The policy was effective from August 24, 1996 through August 24, 1997.Â  \r\nAlthough covered by the assigned-risk policy with Travelers, Willowglen procured voluntary insurance from United, effective July 1, 1997.Â  An employer able to procure voluntary insurance is ineligible for assigned-risk insurance,[1] but Willowglen neither notified Travelers or the NCCI of the voluntary coverage nor attempted to cancel the assigned-risk policy.Â  More important, Willowglen actually renewed the assigned-risk policy with Travelers for the period August 24, 1997 through August 24, 1998 (the renewal policy).\r\nOn September 6, 1997, a date within both Travelersâ€™ and Unitedâ€™s respective stated coverage periods, Marty Avant was injured.Â  Willowglen submitted the claim to Travelers, which remained unaware of the voluntary policy with United.Â  Travelers accepted the claim and began providing benefits.Â  \r\nTravelers eventually became aware of the voluntary policy, in January 1998.Â  Travelers issued a notice of cancelation retroactive to July 1, 1997, the date on which Willowglen acquired voluntary insurance from United.[2]Â  Travelers refunded all premiums paid by Willowglen for assigned-risk coverage after that date.\r\nSubsequently, Travelers filed a motion with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission to identify United as the sole responsible carrier.Â  The single commissioner relied on the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Assigned Risk Plan (the Assigned Risk Plan or the Plan), which was filed with the Department of Insurance by the NCCI and approved by the Director of the Department of Insurance.Â  The commissioner then held that under the Assigned Risk Plan, Travelersâ€™ assigned-risk coverage terminated as a matter of law on July 1, 1997, the date on which United began providing voluntary coverage.Â  The commissioner therefore ruled that United was solely responsible for Willowglenâ€™s claim.\r\nOn appeal, the commissionâ€™s appellate panel affirmed in part and reversed in part.Â  Preliminarily, the panel held that the Assigned Risk Plan does not â€œsupersedeâ€ the workersâ€™ compensation regulations.Â  The panel then found that both Travelers and United â€œintended to have coverage on September 6, 1997â€ and that â€œ[e]quity, in the light of the circumstances of this case, require[d]â€ that United and Travelers equally share responsibility.\r\nOn further appeal, the circuit court affirmed in part and reversed in part.Â  The court found the Plan inapplicable and held Travelers alone responsible under the workersâ€™ compensation regulations.Â  According to the court, Travelersâ€™ attempt to retroactively cancel its coverage was ineffective because the regulations do not permit retroactive cancelation.Â  Also under the regulations, Travelers was presumed responsible because the effective date of its renewal policy (August 24, 1997) was later than that of Unitedâ€™s voluntary policy (July 1, 1997).Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-409(A) (1990) (addressing dual coverage); infra, note 5.\r\nOn further review, the Court of Appeals reversed.Â  The court held that the Assigned Risk Plan has the force of law and determined that the Plan â€œshould be read in conjunction with the Act and its regulations and be accorded effect under the facts of this case given [the Plan] addresses matters where the Act is silent.â€Â  Avant, 356 S.C. at 187-89, 588 S.E.2d at 128-29.Â  The Court of Appeals then held that Travelersâ€™ coverage terminated as a matter of law as soon as United issued its voluntary policy.Â  Id.Â  Consequently, the court ruled that United was solely responsible.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Whether the Assigned Risk Plan has the force of law.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Whether Travelers or United is the responsible carrier.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWe adhere to our holding in Rodriguez v. Romero 363 S.C. 80, 88, 610 S.E.2d 488, 92 (2005), that the Plan has the force of law.Â  In addition, we hold that United is responsible for Willowglenâ€™s claim.Â  We therefore affirm.\r\nI.Â  Force of Law\r\nUnder the Administrative Procedures Act, â€œâ€˜[p]olicy or guidance issued by an agency other than in a regulation does not have the force of law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-10(4) (Supp. 2002).Â  None of the provisions of the Assigned Risk Plan has been promulgated as a regulation.Â  United argues that the lack of promulgation requires a finding that the Plan lacks the force of law, meaning only the workersâ€™ compensation regulations are controlling.Â  See also Rodriguez, 363 S.C. at 88-89, 610 S.E.2d at 492-93 (Toal, C.J., dissenting); Avant, 356 S.C. at 193-97, 588 S.E.2d at 131-33 (Anderson, J., dissenting).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe General Assembly has delegated certain authority over assigned-risk insurance to the Director of the Department of Insurance.[3]Â  South Carolina Code section 38-73-540(A)(1)[4] states that â€œany mechanism designed to implementâ€ the assigned-risk agreement executed by the stateâ€™s insurers â€œmust be submitted in writing to the director or his designee for approval prior to use, together with such additional information as the director or his designee may reasonably require.â€Â  The Code does not require that the implementation mechanism be promulgated as a regulation.Â  Rather, the mechanism attains the force of law when it is approved by the Director of the Department of Insurance.\r\nMoreover, the provisions of the Plan prevail over the workersâ€™ compensation regulations.Â  Code section 38-73-540 specifically addresses assigned-risk insurance and the mechanism for implementing assigned-risk agreements, whereas the regulations address workersâ€™ compensation generally.Â  The principle that more specific rules prevail over general ones applies, and the Plan is the product of a more specific statute.Â  See Mims v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 313, 440 S.E.2d 357, 358-59 (1994) (applying the principle).Â  The Plan controls with respect to issues it addresses.\r\nIn comparison, the Court of Appeals held that the Plan â€œshould be read in conjunction with [the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act] and its regulations and be accorded effect under the facts of this case given [the Plan] addresses matters where the Act is silent.â€Â  Avant, 356 S.C. at 189, 588 S.E.2d at 129 (quoted with approval in Rodriguez, 363 S.C. at 88, 610 S.E.2d at 492).Â  Because this passage could be interpreted to mean that the Plan fills gaps in the workersâ€™ compensation regulations, we clarify that the regulations fill gaps in the Plan.Â  As discussed below, the Plan resolves the issues in this case, so there is no need to resort to the workersâ€™ compensation regulations.\r\nII.Â  Responsible Carrier\r\nAs stated above, Marty Avant was injured on September 6, 1997, a date within the stated coverage periods of both Travelersâ€™ renewal policy and Unitedâ€™s voluntary policy.Â  After becoming aware of Willowglenâ€™s voluntary policy with United, Travelers canceled its assigned-risk policy retroactive to July 1, 1997, the effective date of Unitedâ€™s voluntary policy, and refunded all premiums paid by Willowglen for assigned-risk coverage after that date.\r\nThe first issue is whether Travelersâ€™ renewal policy in fact became effective on its stated effective date, August 24, 1997.Â  If it did, then there was dual coverage on September 6, 1997, and because the Plan does not address dual coverage, a workersâ€™ compensation regulation applies ... in favor of United.[5]Â  For the reasons stated below, we find that Travelersâ€™ renewal policy never became effective, so the dual-coverage issue does not arise.\r\nIn Rodriguez, we held that the assigned-risk policy at issue never became effective because the insured, like Willowglen here, procured voluntary coverage prior to the assigned-risk policyâ€™s effective date.Â  Rodriguez involved a more recent edition of the Assigned Risk Plan, however, and that edition contained language different from this edition.Â  That edition stated:\r\n\r\n  \r\n[A]ny insurer that wishes to insure an employer as voluntary business may do so at any time.Â  If\r\nsuch insurer is not the contract carrier, the contract carrier shall cancel its policy pro rata and the coverage\r\nshall automatically terminate as of the effective date of the voluntary insurerâ€™s policy.\r\n  \r\n(all but â€œpro rataâ€ quoted in Rodriguez, 363 S.C. at 85-86, 610\r\nS.E.2d at 491 (emphasis in opinion altered)).\r\n\r\nThe edition involved in this case states:\r\n\r\n[A]ny insurer that wishes to insure an employer as voluntary business may do so at any time.Â  If\r\n such insurer is not the assigned carrier, the assigned carrier shall cancel its policy pro rata and the assignment\r\nshall automatically terminate as of the effective date of the voluntary insurerâ€™s policy.\r\n\r\nUnited argues that the difference is critical.Â  United emphasizes that the assignment flows from the insurerâ€™s contractual relationship with the other insurers participating in the Assigned Risk Plan, whereas coverage flows from the insurance policy, which represents the relationship between the insurer and the insured.Â  According to United, the edition of the Plan involved here plainly addresses the automatic termination of only the assignment.Â  Based on the principle inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, United asserts that under this edition of the Plan, assigned-risk coverage does not automatically terminate upon the commencement of voluntary coverage.Â  See, e.g., German Evangelical Lutheran Church of Charleston v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 600, 606-07, 576 S.E.2d 150, 153 (2003) (applying the principle); Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 86-87, 533 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2000) (same).Â  Accordingly, United claims, Travelersâ€™ assigned-risk coverage with Willowglen continued to exist until Travelers affirmatively canceled the renewal policy, after September 6, 1997.[6]\r\nAt first glance, Unitedâ€™s argument is appealing.Â  This edition of the Plan does say â€œassignment,â€ not â€œcoverage.â€Â  Nevertheless, the effect of the automatic termination of the assignment is the automatic termination of coverage.Â  Without the assignment there never would have been any policy or coverage.Â  We therefore hold that Travelersâ€™ assigned-risk coverage automatically terminated when Unitedâ€™s voluntary coverage commenced.Â  Consequently, coverage under the renewal policy never became effective.Â  Cf. Rodriguez, 363 S.C. at 82-83, 88, 610 S.E.2d at 489-90, 492 (involving an insured who procured assigned-risk insurance after procuring voluntary coverage, and holding that the assigned-risk policy never became effective). Â There was no dual coverage on September 6, 1997.Â  United was the only carrier.\r\nWe see no significance in the issues raised by United related to the timing and retroactivity of Travelersâ€™ cancelation of the policy.Â  See Avant, 356 S.C. at 191, 588 S.E.2d at 130 (addressing the issues and holding that the Plan â€œallows for this retroactive cancellationâ€).Â  As we have stated, coverage under Travelersâ€™ renewal policy never went into effect.Â  United was the only carrier providing workersâ€™ compensation coverage on September 6, 1997, so United is solely responsible for the claim.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nUnited was the only carrier covering Willowglen when Marty Avant was injured.Â  United is therefore solely responsible for the claim.Â  The decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\n AFFIRMED.Â Â Â  \r\n MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, J.J., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n Chief Justice Toal: I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act are the sole authorities for determining the responsibility for providing workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  For this reason, I would reverse the holding of the court of appeals and affirm the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Travelers, not United, is responsible in this case.\r\nAs I stated in Rodriguez,[7] the majority misconstrues the law to the extent that it reads the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act in conjunction with the guidelines set forth by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI).Â  The NCCI is not a rulemaking body, and furthermore, the NCCI possesses no authority to promulgate regulations with any binding force in South Carolina.[8]Â  The NCCI is simply an advisory body that provides its subscribers with information and data analysis services.\r\nLike Rodriguez, at issue in this case are NCCI provisions regarding how assigned risk insurance policies should be terminated when an insured obtains voluntary coverage at a later time.Â  In my opinion, the majority continues to misinterpret S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-540(A)(1) to grant the director of the Department of Insurance the discretionary authority to adopt binding regulations governing assigned risk insurance policies.Â  The statute does not grant such power to the director, but instead allows the director to approve agreements made among assigned risk insurance carriers.Â  Any approved agreement would of course bind the agreeing parties, but the question of whether these agreements bind an individual insured is an entirely different matter.Â  \r\nAny agreement that has not undergone the process of regulatory approval called for in the Administrative Procedures Act cannot be viewed as a regulation that carries the force of law.Â  Furthermore, unless these agreements or their terms appear in the individual assigned risk insurance policies, it is clear that the terms of these agreements cannot be viewed as binding contractual provisions.Â  The assigned risk policy at issue in this case says nothing about termination of the policy upon the purchase of a voluntary policy by the insured.Â  Therefore, I would rely solely on the Workersâ€™ Compensation act and its corresponding regulations to determine coverage.\r\nThe applicable workersâ€™ compensation regulation provides that when there are two insurance policies securing the same liability, the policy with the later effective date is responsible for coverage.Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-409(A) (1976).Â  In the instant case, Travelersâ€™ policy has an effective date of August 24, 1997 and Unitedâ€™s policy has an effective date of July 1, 1997.Â  Pursuant to Regulation 64-409(A), I would hold that Travelers is the proper carrier because its policy has the later effective date.\r\nWith this decision, the majority has significantly weakened South Carolinaâ€™s Administrative Procedures Act and, in my view, improperly empowered the head of an administrative agency to promulgate rules having the force of law.Â  The legislature may not empower the head of an agency to unilaterally make declarations carrying the binding force of law; therefore, we cannot interpret Â§ 38-73-540(A)(1) in this manner.Â  I find it extremely telling that the majority would give binding force to these NCCI regulations which do not appear in the State Register, have not been debated in the Legislature, and are published in no public resource.Â  Although the majority is arguably not creating â€œsecret lawâ€ in the sense that it existed in several agencies prior to the enactment of the APA, unfortunately, it appears we now must purchase an NCCI subscription to ascertain the particulars of South Carolina workersâ€™ compensation law.Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals and affirm the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Travelers is the responsible carrier.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-540(A) (2002).\r\n[2] Travelers initially issued a notice of cancelation effective March 19, 1998, which is not germane to the issues before us.\r\n[3] Whether the delegation is lawful is not an issue before us.\r\n[4] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-540(A)(1) (2002).\r\n[5] Regulation 67-409(A) states: \r\n\r\nWhen duplicate or dual coverage exists by\r\n reason of two different insurance carriers\r\n issuing two policies to the same employer\r\n securing the same liability, the Commission\r\n shall presume the policy with the later\r\n effective date is in force and the earlier\r\n policy terminated on the effective date of the\r\n later policy. \r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-409(A) (1990).\r\nBecause its policyâ€™s stated effective date is later than that of Unitedâ€™s policy, Travelers would be presumed responsible if Regulation 67-409(A) were controlling. \r\n[6] As mentioned above, in 1998 Travelers canceled its policy retroactive to July 1, 1997.Â  As discussed below, United argues that this retroactive cancelation was invalid.\r\n[7] Rodriguez v.

Abney, both of Nelson, Mullins, Riley &amp; Scarborough, of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae South Carolina Hospital Association. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This case arose out of the events surrounding Oconee Memorial Hospitalâ€™s (Oconee) decision to offer anesthesiology and internal medical services on an exclusive basis.Â  A jury returned a verdict against Oconee.Â  The trial court reduced the verdict pursuant to the charitable immunity statute.Â  This appeal followed.Â  After certifying this case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s denial of Oconeeâ€™s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  \r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nOconee is a private eleemosynary (charitable) hospital.Â  Dr. McMillan has been a member of the medical staff at Oconee for almost 13 years and specializes in anesthesiology and internal medicine.Â  Additionally, Dr. McMillan is the sole shareholder of Blue Ridge Medical Specialties, P.A. (collectively referred to as McMillan). \r\nFor several years prior to this litigation, McMillan performed anesthesiology services at Oconee alongside the doctors of Anesthesiology Consultants of the Upstate, P.A. (Upstate).Â  But after McMillan formed his own practice group, the two became competitors.Â  During this period, the anesthesiology services at the hospital operated on an open-staff basis, therefore, all physicians with the appropriate privileges were permitted to practice anesthesiology and pain management.Â  The development of two competing practice groups at Oconee, however, was problematic.Â  As a result, the board at Oconee decided to pursue exclusive contracts for its anesthesiology services.\r\nOconee sought proposals for the award of an exclusive agreement to provide staff and anesthesiology services.Â  Both Upstate and McMillan submitted proposals providing four physicians and six staff nurses to perform services at Oconee.Â  However, at the time of the proposal, only two of Upstateâ€™s anesthesiologists and four of the nurses were available to start immediately at Oconee.Â  In contrast, all of McMillanâ€™s personnel were available to start immediately.\r\nPrior to the board at Oconee awarding an exclusive contract, several communications about the new exclusive contract took place between board members and officers at Oconee.Â  Eventually the board awarded the contract to Upstate.Â  McMillan was informed that his privileges at Oconee would end before January of 2002.\r\nAs a result of the actions of Oconee and Upstate, McMillan filed suit alleging civil conspiracy, breach of contract, violations of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with existing contractual relations, tortious interference with prospective contractual relations, denial of due process, wrongful taking, and inverse condemnation.Â  In addition, McMillan sought injunctive relief.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Oconee and Upstate as to the claims for breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with existing contractual relation, tortious interference with prospective contractual relations, denial of due process, wrongful taking, and inverse condemnation.Â  Further, the trial court granted Oconee and Upstateâ€™s directed verdict motions for the claims for breach of contract and violations of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  The parties went to trial on the issues of injunctive relief and civil conspiracy.Â  McMillan claimed that Oconee and Upstate conspired to oust him from his privileges at Oconee.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of McMillan for $1,275,000 against Oconee only.Â  As a result, McMillan made a motion to conform the pleadings to the evidence to allege civil conspiracy against Oconee.Â  Oconee filed post trial motions including a motion to reduce the verdict and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  The trial court granted the motion to reduce the verdict and the verdict was reduced to $300,000 pursuant to the charitable immunity statute.Â  The trial court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  In addition, the trial court granted permanent injunctive relief in favor of McMillan allowing him to perform certain limited services at Oconee.Â  However, the trial court granted Oconeeâ€™s application for supersedeas of the injunctive relief pending appeal.\r\nBoth parties appealed.Â  As a result, the following issues are before the Court for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in denying Oconeeâ€™s motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the civil conspiracy claims?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in reducing the amount of the judgment?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Are the charitable immunity liability limits inapplicable to a claim for civil conspiracy, and as a result, is Oconee not entitled to the statutory protection therein?Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        IV.&nbsp;\r\n         Do the statutory caps applicable to charitable organizations violate equal protection?Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        V.\r\n         Did the trial court err in granting McMillan injunctive relief?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPost Trial Motions \r\nOconee argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the civil conspiracy claim.Â  We agree.\r\nIn ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.Â  Strange v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways and Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).Â  The motions should be denied where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Id.Â  The trial court can only be reversed by this Court when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAn action for civil conspiracy is an action at law, and the trial courtâ€™s findings will be upheld on appeal unless they are without evidentiary support.Â  Gynecology Clinic, Inc. v. Cloer, 334 S.C. 555, 556, 514 S.E.2d 592, 592-93 (1999).Â  A civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons joining for the purpose of injuring and causing special damage to the plaintiff.Â  Lawson v. S.C. Dept. of Corrections, 340 S.C. 346, 352, 532 S.E.2d 289, 261 (2000).Â  Civil conspiracy involves acts that are by their very nature covert and clandestine and usually not susceptible of proof by direct evidence.Â  Robertson v. First Union Natâ€™l Bank, 350 S.C. 339, 349, 565 S.E.2d 309, 314 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, a civil conspiracy cannot exist when the alleged acts arise in the context of a principal-agent relationship because by virtue of the relationship such acts do not involve separate entities.Â  Perk v. Vector Resources Group, LTD, 485 S.E.2d 140, 144 (Va. 1997).\r\nWhile this Court has not addressed the issue directly, this Court has held that agents for a corporation acting in the scope of their duties cannot conspire with the corporation absent the guilty knowledge of a third party.Â  Goble v. Am. Ry. Express Co., et. al., 124 S.C. 19, __, 115 S.E. 900, __ (1923).Â  In support of our Courtâ€™s prior opinion, we believe that it is well settled that a corporation cannot conspire with itself.Â  See 16 Am. Jur. 2d Conspiracy Â§56 (2005) (stating that a corporation cannot be a party to a conspiracy consisting of the corporation and the persons engaged in the management, direction, and control of the corporate affairs, where the individuals are acting only for the corporation and not for any personal purpose of their own). Â Â \r\nIn the present case, the jury returned a verdict against Oconee for civil conspiracy.Â  McMillan then made a motion to conform the pleadings to the evidence to allege an Oconee only conspiracy.Â  As a result, McMillan has failed to allege or prove a conspiracy.Â  A civil conspiracy cannot be found to exist when the acts alleged are those of employees or directors, in their official capacity, conspiring with the corporation.Â  As a result, we hold that no conspiracy can exist if the conduct challenged is a single act by a single corporation acting exclusively through its own directors, officers, and employees, each acting within the scope of his employment.\r\nTherefore, we reverse the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nReduction of the Judgment \r\nMcMillan argues that the trial court erred in reducing the judgment.Â  Because we find that no conspiracy took place and a judgment against Oconee was improper, we do not address the issue of whether the judgment was properly reduced.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nApplicability of Charitable Immunity Provisions \r\nMcMillan argues that the charitable immunity provisions are inapplicable to a claim for civil conspiracy, and as a result, damages may not be capped.Â  Because we hold that no civil conspiracy took place, the issue of the applicability of the charitable immunity statute is moot.\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nConstitutionality of Charitable Immunity Provisions \r\nMcMillan argues that the statutory caps for judgments against charitable organizations violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution.Â  As a result of our holding that no civil conspiracy existed, we do not address this issue.\r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nInjunctive relief \r\nOconee argues that the trial court erred in granting McMillan injunctive relief.Â  We agree.Â  Because McMillan failed to prove a civil conspiracy, the trial judge erred in granting injunctive relief.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we reverse the trial court.Â  McMillan did not properly allege an action for civil conspiracy.Â  As a result, the trial court erred in denying Oconeeâ€™s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of John J.
