[1]\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in\r\n  granting School District summary judgment? [2]\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\ncircuit court granted School District summary judgment, finding that under the\r\nexpress terms of her contract Cape was an at-will employee,\r\nand therefore had no breach of contract cause of action based on her\r\ntermination.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nCape\r\nargues the judge erred in finding her contract was at-will.&nbsp; She correctly\r\npoints out that decisions from this Court have indicated an employment contract\r\nfor a specific term cannot also be at-will because these terms are mutually\r\nexclusively.&nbsp; E.g., Stiles v. American Gen. Life Ins. Co.,\r\n335 S.C. 222, 516 S.E.2d 449 (1999); Shivers v. John H. Harland Co., 310\r\nS.C. 217, 423 S.E.2d 105 (1992); Young v. McKelvey, 286 S.C. 119, 333\r\nS.E.2d 566 (1985).&nbsp; School District counters with the accurate observation\r\nthat these decisions all involved contracts of indefinite duration that provided\r\nfor pre-termination notice, and further observes that Capeâ€™s contract is not\r\nof indefinite duration but for a definite term, contains no such notice\r\nprovision, and includes the â€œat-willâ€ provision recited above.&nbsp; We\r\nagree with School District that none of our previous\r\nopinions have decided the precise issue presented here.\r\nCape relies heavily on this\r\nstatement from Young v. McKelvey, which is a quote from a Maryland\r\ndecision:\r\n\r\n  An employment contract may be\r\n  either for a stated term or at will.&nbsp; When the contract is at will, it\r\n  may be terminated by either party at any time.&nbsp; However, when the\r\n  contract is for a stated term, it may only be terminated before the end of the\r\n  term by just causeâ€¦.\r\n  Chai Mgmt., Inc. v. Lubowitz,\r\n  50 Md. App. 504, 439 A.2d 34 (1982).\r\n\r\nIn Chai, the contract was of\r\nindefinite duration but included a provision that, â€œThis contract can be\r\nterminated by either party with a written sixty day notice.â€&nbsp; Similarly,\r\nthe contract at issue in Young v. McKelvey was for an indefinite term,\r\nbut contained a provision that it could be cancelled upon 60 days written notice\r\nby either party.&nbsp; The Court held this notice provision converted the\r\ncontract from one terminable at will, that is, at anytime for any reason or no\r\nreason, to one of sixty days duration upon the giving of notice.&nbsp; Thus, the\r\nemployee could not be terminated until 60 days after the giving of notice unless\r\njust cause for the termination existed.&nbsp; Young v. McKelvey, supra.&nbsp;\r\nThe notice provision altered the partiesâ€™ absolute right to terminate from â€œat\r\nwillâ€ to â€œupon the giving of notice.â€\r\nThe contract in Shivers v. John\r\nC. Harland, Inc. was also for an indeterminate period, but specifically\r\nprovided for immediate discharge for cause, or for â€œvoluntary terminationâ€\r\nby either party upon 15 days written notice.&nbsp; This contract, like that in Young\r\nv. McKelvey, altered the right to terminate from at-will to upon the giving\r\nof the stated notice.&nbsp; The most recent decision, Stiles v. American Gen.\r\nLife Ins. Co., is instructive in that it refers to contracts such as those\r\nat issue in it and in Shivers as â€œat-will contracts with a notice [of\r\ntermination] provision.â€&nbsp; These cases did not involve the type of\r\nemployment contract at issue here: â€œa definite term contract with an at-will\r\ntermination provision.â€\r\nAn employment contract for an\r\nindefinite term is presumptively terminable at will, while a contract for a\r\ndefinite term is presumptively terminable only upon just cause.&nbsp; These are\r\nmere presumptions, however, which the parties can alter by express contract\r\nprovisions.&nbsp; For example, our employee handbook decisions have involved\r\nindefinite duration contracts where the at-will termination presumption has been\r\naltered by language used in the handbook.&nbsp; E.g., Small v. Springs\r\nIndus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987).&nbsp; In the three\r\ndecisions cited by Cape, the parties had altered the\r\nat-will presumption by including a notice of termination clause.&nbsp; This case\r\npresents a similar situation: the parties have, by an express contract\r\nprovision, altered the presumption that employment for a definite term is\r\nterminable only upon just cause, and replaced that presumption with an at-will\r\ntermination clause.&nbsp; Cf., Prescott v. Farmers Tele. Co-op., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 516\r\nS.E.2d 923 (1999) (â€œOf course, an employer and employee may choose to\r\ncontractually alter the general rule of employment at will and restrict their\r\nfreedom to discharge without cause or to resign with impunityâ€).\r\nThe judge correctly held this\r\nemployment contract, while for a definite term, was terminable at will.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order\r\ngranting School Districtâ€™s motion for summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and\r\nBURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Cape was hired for less than 152 days and was therefore not classified\r\nas a contract teacher.&nbsp; See S.C. Reg. 43-205.1 IX (Supp. 2004); compare\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-26-40 (Supp. 2004) (different teacher contract levels\r\nexplained).\r\n[2] While Cape raises a number of issues on appeal, we address only\r\nthis novel question.&nbsp; The rulings on the other issues are affirmed pursuant\r\nto Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26021","title":"The Island Packet v.

Code Ann. Â§\r\n40-47-213 (2001).[2]\r\nSubsequently, the Board attempted to\r\ndiscipline Anonymous Physician again.&nbsp; On April 26, 2002, it issued a\r\nformal complaint against the physician citing his past and current alcohol\r\nproblems.&nbsp; On May 24, 2004, the Board issued an order placing the physician\r\non temporary suspension.&nbsp; This order was posted on the Boardâ€™s web site\r\nthe next day and was disseminated to the media.&nbsp; According to the order,\r\nthe Board had received information that the physician had â€œappeared in the\r\nemergency room at Hilton Head Medical Center\r\nto treat a patient while [he] was impaired.&nbsp; . . . [he] was asked to leave\r\nthe emergency room and another physician assumed the patient care. . . .â€\r\nThe order also recites a letter to\r\nthe Board from the Hilton Head Regional Medical Centerâ€™s\r\ndirector.&nbsp; The letter advises that the physician was summarily suspended\r\nfrom the medical center on March 16, 2004, due to possible impairment while on\r\ncall for the emergency department.&nbsp; The order further notes the physician\r\nhad failed to comply with the recommendations of the Recovering Professionals\r\nProgram (RPP) and concludes his addiction to alcohol rendered him unfit to\r\npractice medicine and that his refusal to cooperate and abide by his agreement\r\nwith the RPP constituted a serious threat to the publicâ€™s health, safety, and\r\nwelfare.\r\nDuring this time, Island Packet\r\nwrote the ALC to request the opportunity to be present at any hearing concerning\r\nAnonymous Physician and to object to any attempts to close such a hearing.&nbsp;\r\nNotwithstanding Island Packetâ€™s requests, by May 26, the order of temporary\r\nsuspension was removed from the Boardâ€™s website and replaced with the\r\nfollowing statement:&nbsp; â€œNo disciplinary action taken by the Board.&nbsp;\r\nThis certifies that the above licensee is in good standing.â€&nbsp; The next\r\nday, Island Packet again wrote the ALC and requested production of any order\r\nissued by the ALC related to this matter.&nbsp; The ALC did not respond.\r\nUltimately, Anonymous Physician and\r\nthe Board resolved the matter and entered into a Consent Order, which provided\r\nthe Board would dismiss the formal complaint and order of temporary suspension\r\nof May 24, 2004.&nbsp; This consent order was approved and signed by the ALC and\r\nissued on June 17, 2004.&nbsp; The consent order provided that it was not a\r\nfinal order and that all records were to remain under seal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    What is the scope of authority\r\n    of the Administrative Law Court to review interlocutory orders in physician\r\n    disciplinary proceedings?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Is the Administrative\r\n    Law Court required to issue an order setting forth specific findings\r\n    regarding closure of physician disciplinary proceedings?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nIsland Packet argues the ALC does\r\nnot have the authority to review interlocutory matters in physician disciplinary\r\nproceedings.&nbsp; We find the Boardâ€™s orders of temporary suspension and the\r\n2001 order requiring Anonymous Physician to undergo an evaluation were not â€œfinal\r\nordersâ€ and were not immediately appealable to the ALC.\r\nThe 2004 order states, â€œRespondentâ€™s\r\nlicense to practice medicine in this state is hereby temporarily suspended,\r\neffective immediately, pending hearing and until further Order of the Board.â€&nbsp;\r\n(Emphasis added).[3]&nbsp; The 2001\r\norder of temporary suspension states similar language.&nbsp; The language of the\r\norders clearly indicates they are not final.\r\nFurther, the Boardâ€™s description\r\nof its disciplinary procedures posted on its website[4] states:&nbsp; â€œAfter the required hearings and a\r\nreview of all evidence, the Board issues a Final Order.â€&nbsp; Under the\r\nheading, â€œAppeals from Orders,â€ the Board states:&nbsp; â€œThe State or the\r\nlicensee may appeal a final order of the Board within thirty days.&nbsp; All\r\nappeals are first taken to the Administrative Law Judge Division.â€&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, a required hearing must be held before an order is final.&nbsp; This\r\nis further evidence that the order of temporary suspension is not final in this\r\ncase given that the Board indicated there would later be a hearing and a further\r\norder of the Board.&nbsp; While the orders were not final, the question remains\r\nwhether the orders are appealable to the ALC.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(D) (2005)\r\nstates:&nbsp; â€œAn administrative law judge also shall preside over all\r\nhearings of appeals from final decisions of contested cases before\r\nprofessional and occupational licensing boards or commissions within the\r\nDepartment of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, or as otherwise provided by\r\nlaw, pursuant to Section 1-23-380.â€&nbsp; (Emphasis added).&nbsp; Pursuant\r\nto S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (2005), the ALC has the authority to review final\r\ndecisions of the Medical Board.\r\nSection 1-23-380(A), under the\r\nchapter entitled, â€œState Agency Rule Making and Adjudication of Contested\r\nCases,â€ provides:\r\n\r\n  A party who has exhausted all\r\n  administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a\r\n  final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this\r\n  article, Article 1, and Article 5.&nbsp; . . . A preliminary, procedural,\r\n  or intermediate agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of\r\n  the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).[5]\r\nThe\r\nlanguage of Â§ 1-23-380(B) clearly allows the ALC to review a â€œfinalâ€\r\ndecision of the Board.&nbsp; However, pursuant to subsection (A) of Â§ 1-23-380,\r\nwhich is incorporated into subsection (B) by reference, the language is also\r\nclear that â€œ[a] preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or\r\nruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency decision would\r\nnot provide an adequate remedy.â€&nbsp; Therefore, a physician has the ability\r\nto appeal an interlocutory disciplinary decision by the Board if a review of the\r\nfinal decision would not provide an adequate remedy.&nbsp; We conclude the\r\ntemporary suspension orders were not immediately reviewable because review of\r\nthe final agency decision would provide an adequate remedy for Anonymous\r\nPhysician.\r\nWe note that one day after the Board\r\nissued the 2004 order of temporary suspension, the Board placed the order on its\r\nwebsite and disseminated the order to the media.&nbsp; This order not only\r\nstated that the Anonymous Physician was suspended but also detailed the\r\nunderlying facts of the complaint against Anonymous Physician.&nbsp; One day\r\nlater, the Board removed the information.&nbsp; Regarding this publication, if\r\nthe Board had refused to remove the information from its website, then Anonymous\r\nPhysician could have requested the ALC order the Board to remove the publicized\r\ninformation. &nbsp;In that particular case, the review of a final decision by\r\nthe Board would not provide an adequate remedy for the publication of Anonymous\r\nPhysicianâ€™s discipline.&nbsp; However, because the Board quickly acted to\r\nremove the offending information, Anonymous Physician was no longer an aggrieved\r\nparty because he received the relief he desired without having to seek relief\r\nfrom the ALC.[6]\r\nThe 2001 order, requiring that\r\nAnonymous Physician undergo a mental or physical examination, also was not\r\nimmediately appealable to the ALC and the ALC should not have superseded this\r\norder.&nbsp; Awaiting a final decision in that matter would not prevent the\r\nphysician from receiving an adequate remedy as envisioned by the statute.\r\nTherefore, the temporary suspension\r\norders and the evaluation order were not immediately appealable to the ALC.&nbsp;\r\nWe refrain from stating a general rule that any interlocutory order by the Board\r\nis or is not immediately appealable to the ALC.&nbsp; The language of Â§\r\n1-23-380(A) indicates that whether an intermediate action or ruling is\r\nimmediately reviewable is to be decided on a case-by-case basis, i.e.\r\nwhether a review of the final decision would not provide an adequate remedy.\r\nII\r\nIsland Packet and the Medical Board\r\nargue the ALC erred by not issuing an order setting forth specific findings\r\nregarding its decision to close these proceedings.&nbsp; We conclude the ALC is\r\nrequired to issue an order that states findings which explain the balancing of\r\nthe interests involved and the need for closure of the proceeding.\r\nSection 1-23-600(A) provides:&nbsp;\r\nâ€œProceedings before administrative law judges are open to the public unless\r\nconfidentiality is allowed or required by law&nbsp; . . . The decisions or\r\norders of administrative law judges are not required to be published, but are\r\navailable for public inspection unless the confidentiality thereof is allowed\r\nor required by law.â€&nbsp; (Emphasis added).&nbsp; Therefore, to decide\r\nwhether the ALC proceedings were properly sealed, we must determine whether\r\nconfidentiality is required by other law.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§\r\n40-47-213 (2001) provides:\r\n\r\n  No person . . . may mention the\r\n  existence of the complaint, investigation, or other proceeding, disclose any\r\n  information pertaining to the complaint, investigation, or other proceeding,\r\n  or discuss any testimony or other evidence in the complaint, investigation, or\r\n  other proceeding, except to persons involved and having a direct interest in\r\n  the complaint, investigation or other proceeding, and then only to the extent\r\n  necessary for the proper disposition of the complaint, investigation, or other\r\n  proceeding.&nbsp; . . . Nothing contained in this section may be construed so\r\n  as to prevent the board from making public a copy of its final order in any\r\n  proceeding as authorized or required by law.[7]\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Reg. 81-20 and S.C.\r\nReg. 81-26 both elaborate on the privacy of physician disciplinary\r\nproceedings.&nbsp; Reg. 81-20 states:&nbsp; â€œall proceedings and documents\r\nrelating to formal complaints and hearings thereon and to proceedings in\r\nconnection therewith shall be private.â€&nbsp; Reg. 81-26 likewise\r\nprovides:&nbsp; â€œAll proceedings and documents relating to formal complaints\r\nand hearings thereon and to disciplinary proceedings in connection therewith\r\nshall be private . . . . All proceedings and records pertaining to any\r\ndisciplinary proceedings, except final orders of the Board . . . shall be the\r\nprivate records of the Board . . . .â€\r\nPursuant to former Â§ 40-47-213 and\r\nthe regulations, it is clear that physician disciplinary proceedings are\r\nconfidential until a final order is issued or unless the physician requests that\r\nthe proceedings be made public.[8]&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the ALC did not err by sealing the records involved in this case\r\ngiven the Board had not issued a final order.[9]&nbsp; However, the manner in which the ALC closed the proceedings\r\nwas inappropriate and did not comply with South Carolina law.&nbsp; Although the ALC is not a court, it is a\r\npublic body; and, as a public body, the ALC is required to make specific,\r\nexpress findings of fact when faced with an issue in which there is a\r\ndispute.&nbsp; See Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. South Carolina\r\nDepâ€™t of Rev., 342 S.C. 34, 535 S.E.2d 642 (2000) (ALC is agency of\r\nexecutive branch of government and must follow law as written until its\r\nconstitutionally is judicially determined); Able Communications, Inc. v.\r\nSouth Carolian Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 290 S.C. 409, 351 S.E.2d 151 (1986)\r\n(where material facts are in dispute, administrative body must make specific,\r\nexpress findings of fact).&nbsp; The factors to be considered by the ALC may not\r\nbe limited to, but should include:&nbsp; the ensuring of fairness; the need for\r\nwitness cooperation; the reliance of the parties upon confidentiality; the\r\npublic or professional significance of the proceeding; and the harm to parties\r\nfrom disclosure.&nbsp; See Davis v. Jennings, 304 S.C. 502, 405 S.E.2d 601 (1991).&nbsp; Therefore,\r\nwe find the ALC is required to make specific findings of fact when it decides to\r\nclose the proceedings before it and when the closure of the proceedings is\r\nchallenged.\r\nIn the ALCâ€™s order sealing the\r\nrecords, the ALC stated Â§ 40-47-213 and the regulations provided that the\r\nmatters were confidential until the Board had issued a final order.&nbsp; The\r\nALC then discussed the two 2001 orders issued by the Board and explained that\r\nthose orders were not final.&nbsp; The ALC noted that the conclusion that the\r\nphysicianâ€™s disciplinary matters were not subject to public disclosure was â€œeven\r\nmore compelling in light of the fact that in both of [the] matters, the Orders\r\nof the Board have been vacated and the cases have been remanded to the Board for\r\nfurther proceedings.â€\r\nThe ALCâ€™s order does not comply\r\nwith South Carolina law because specific findings\r\nregarding why the proceedings should be closed were not made on the\r\nrecord.&nbsp; While the ALC did not err by closing the proceedings given the\r\ndisciplinary proceedings were still in the investigatory stage, the ALC is still\r\nrequired to make specific findings on the record, especially given the fact Island Packet had directly requested an\r\nopportunity to be present and privy to the proceedings.&nbsp; The ALC should\r\nhave engaged in an analysis that balanced the interests of the physician and the\r\npublic and should have explained the need for closure.&nbsp; Therefore, the ALC\r\ncould not seal the records until after specific findings, as to why closure was\r\nnecessary, were made on the record.&nbsp; Because the findings were not made,\r\nthis matter is remanded to the ALC for that purpose.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find, pursuant to Â§ 1-23-380(A),\r\nthe Boardâ€™s temporary suspension orders and the evaluation order were not\r\nimmediately appealable to the ALC.&nbsp; We further find the ALC is required to\r\nmake specific findings, on the record, balancing the interests of the physician\r\nand the public and explaining the need for closure of the disciplinary\r\nproceedings.&nbsp; Therefore, the decisions of the ALC are\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT,\r\nJJ., and Mary E.

Husband petitioned for review, and\r\nthe court of appeals affirmed.\r\nThis Court granted certiorari to\r\nreview the following issue:\r\n\r\n  Did the court of appeals err in\r\n  dismissing Husbandâ€™s appeal as untimely?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nHusband contends that the filing of\r\na second post-trial motion tolled the time period for filing a notice of appeal,\r\nand therefore the court of appeals erred in dismissing his appeal as\r\nuntimely.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe filing of successive post-trial\r\nmotions raising issues already raised to and ruled upon by the trial court does\r\nnot toll the time to serve a notice of appeal. Quality Trailer Products, Inc.\r\nv. CSL Equip. Co., Inc., 349 S.C. 216, 219, 562 S.E.2d 615, 617\r\n(2002).&nbsp; A second motion â€œis appropriate only if it challenges something\r\nthat was altered from the original judgment as a result of the initial motion .\r\n. . .â€ Coward Hund Constr. Co. v. IGT, 336 S.C. 1, 3, 518 S.E.2d 56, 58\r\n(Ct. App. 1999).&nbsp; These general principles were recently affirmed in Elam\r\nv. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 20, 602 S.E.2d 772, 778 (2004).\r\nIn the present case, Husband filed\r\ntwo successive post-trial motions.&nbsp; In the first motion, Husband contended,\r\namong other things, that the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was excessive.&nbsp; At\r\nthe hearing on this motion, Husband apparently argued that attorneyâ€™s fees\r\nshould have been calculated at a rate of $250 per hour instead of $300 per hour.[1]&nbsp; The court rejected this\r\nargument and found that an affidavit submitted by Wifeâ€™s attorney referring to\r\na rate of $250 per hour constituted a scrivenerâ€™s error, and therefore the\r\nrate of $300 per hour was correct.&nbsp; As a result, the court affirmed the\r\naward of fees in the original judgment.\r\nIn response to this ruling, Husband\r\nfiled a second motion to alter or amend, this time requesting that the court\r\ndelete the entire paragraph concerning attorneyâ€™s fees and the scrivenerâ€™s\r\nerror.&nbsp; Husband did not state any grounds for this request.&nbsp; The court\r\ndenied the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFirst, Husband contends that the\r\nruling on the first motion substantively altered the courtâ€™s original\r\njudgment, and therefore the second motion tolled the period for filing a notice\r\nof appeal.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; The courtâ€™s ruling on the first motion\r\naffirmed the award of attorneyâ€™s fees at a rate of $300 per hour.&nbsp;\r\nBecause the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was affirmed, and nothing from the\r\noriginal judgment was altered, the second motion, asking the court to delete the\r\nparagraph concerning the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees, was not appropriate.&nbsp; See\r\nCoward Hund, 336 S.C. at 3, 518 S.E.2d at 58 (holding that a second motion\r\nâ€œis appropriate only if it challenges something that was altered from the\r\noriginal judgment as a result of the initial motion . . . .â€). Therefore, the\r\nsecond post-trial motion did not toll the time for appeal.\r\nSecond, Husband contends that the\r\nsecond post-trial motion was based on different grounds than his first\r\npost-trial motion.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; In the first motion, Husband asked\r\nthe court to review the entire order on attorneyâ€™s fees, arguing that the fees\r\nwere excessive.&nbsp; In the second motion, Husband requested, without\r\nexplanation, that the entire paragraph regarding fees be deleted from the June\r\n20 order.&nbsp; We can only presume that this attempt to delete the courtâ€™s\r\nruling on attorneyâ€™s fees was another attempt to raise the issue regarding\r\nattorneyâ€™s fees.&nbsp; Therefore, because the second motion did not articulate\r\nany groundsâ€”much less different groundsâ€”we disagree with Husbandâ€™s\r\nargument that the second motion was based on different grounds than the first\r\nmotion.&nbsp; As a result, we find that the second motion did not toll the time\r\nto file an appeal.&nbsp; See Quality Trailer, 349 S.C. at 219, 562 S.E.2d\r\nat 617 (holding that the filing of successive post-trial motions raising issues\r\nalready raised to and ruled upon by the trial court does not toll the time to\r\nserve a notice of appeal).\r\nFinally, Husband contends that the\r\nsecond motion was necessary to preserve for review his challenge to the award of\r\nattorneyâ€™s fees premised on a finding of a scrivenerâ€™s error.&nbsp; But\r\nHusband did not raise the scrivenerâ€™s error issue in his second motion.&nbsp;\r\nIn fact, he did not raise any new issues.&nbsp; Therefore, the second motion was\r\nnot necessary to preserve the issue for appeal.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the court\r\nof appeals properly dismissed Husbandâ€™s appeal as untimely.&nbsp; On March 24,\r\n2003, the divorce decree was filed.&nbsp; On April 2, a supplemental order\r\nrequiring Husband to pay attorneyâ€™s fees was filed.&nbsp; On April 17, Husband\r\nfiled a post-trial motion to alter or amend.&nbsp; On June 20, the court denied\r\nthe motion.&nbsp; On July 8, Husband filed a second post-trial motion to alter\r\nor amend.&nbsp; On August 5, this motion was denied.&nbsp; Because we find that\r\nthe second post-trial motion did not toll the time for appeal, Husbandâ€™s\r\nnotice of appealâ€”filed on August 19, approximately two months after the June\r\n20 orderâ€”was untimely.&nbsp; See Rule 203(b)(1) and (2), SCACR (a\r\nnotice of appeal in a case appealed from family court shall be served within\r\nthirty days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or\r\njudgment).&nbsp; Therefore, the notice of appeal was properly dismissed.&nbsp;\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the reasoning above, we\r\naffirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision dismissing the notice of appeal as\r\nuntimely.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; PLEICONES, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; I\r\nrespectfully dissent because, in my opinion, Petitionerâ€™s notice of appeal was\r\ntimely.&nbsp; I would therefore reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ order dismissing\r\nthe appeal and remand the matter to that court with instructions that the appeal\r\ngo forward.\r\nOn March 24, 2003, the family court\r\nfiled its â€œFinal Decree of Divorce.â€&nbsp; While this order stated that\r\nPetitioner would be required to contribute to Respondentâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees\r\nand other expertsâ€™ fees, the amounts to be paid were not specified.&nbsp; On\r\nApril 3, 2003, the judge filed a supplemental order correcting his initial\r\nclerical error and awarding Respondent approximately $46,000 in fees.&nbsp;\r\nPetitioner filed a motion to alter or amend; following a hearing the family\r\ncourt judge filed an â€œOrder Regarding Post Trial Motionâ€ on June 20,\r\n2003.&nbsp; In this order, the judge explained for the first time that he\r\ncalculated Petitionerâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fee rates at $300/per hour rather than\r\nthe $250/per hour mentioned at one point in Petitionerâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fee\r\naffidavit because the judge concluded that the reference to $250 was â€œa\r\nscrivenerâ€™s error.â€\r\nFollowing receipt of the June 20\r\norder, Petitioner filed a second post-trial motion asking only that the judge\r\ndelete from that order the paragraph finding that the reference to $250/per hour\r\nwas a scrivenerâ€™s error.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 5, 2003, an order denying this\r\nrequest was filed.&nbsp; In this order, the family court judge noted that this\r\nparagraph had been included because Rule 26, SCFCR, required that he make a\r\nspecific fact finding why he rejected Petitionerâ€™s contention that the proper\r\nfigure was $250 rather than $300.&nbsp; Petitioner then served and filed his\r\nnotice of appeal on August 20, 2003.\r\nThe Court of Appeals apparently\r\ndismissed Petitionerâ€™s appeal because it found that his second post-trial\r\nmotion was impermissibly successive, and that therefore the thirty-day period to\r\nserve the notice of appeal commenced when Petitioner received the June 20 order\r\ndenying his first post-trial motion.&nbsp; See &nbsp;Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t\r\nof Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004)(when successive post-trial\r\nmotions will toll the time to appeal).&nbsp; While the majority agrees with the\r\nCourt of Appeals, I do not.&nbsp; A post-trial motion does not toll the time to\r\nappeal when it merely raises the same issues and arguments made in a prior\r\npost-trial motion.&nbsp; Elam,\r\nsupra.&nbsp; In this case, however, Petitionerâ€™s second post-trial\r\nmotion asked only that the family court reconsider a finding made in its first\r\npost-trial order.&nbsp; Petitioner could not have raised this issue until he\r\nreceived that order, and had he not challenged it through a post-trial motion\r\nwould have been bound by that finding on appeal.&nbsp; See Pelican Bldg.\r\nCenters v.

Thomasson, 355\r\nS.C. 521, 586 S.E.2d 141 (Ct. App. 2003).&nbsp; We granted certiorari to review\r\nthe court of appealsâ€™ decision.&nbsp; We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nJohn Thomas Neely (Decedent) and\r\nJosephine Morgan (Mother) married on July 22, 1944.&nbsp; Approximately seven\r\nmonths before the couple married, Mother gave birth to a baby girl, Nancy.&nbsp;\r\nThe birth certificate listed Decedent as the father, and the child was given\r\nDecedentâ€™s last name.\r\nTwo-and-a-half years after marrying,\r\nthe couple separated.&nbsp; The separation agreement states that the couple has\r\nâ€œone child, Nancy Jane Neely, a girl,â€ and that Decedent â€œshall have the\r\nright and privilege to see and visit with his infant daughter at any reasonable\r\ntime or place.â€&nbsp; The agreement also released Decedent of all obligations\r\nto support Mother or Nancy.&nbsp;\r\nThereafter, the couple lived apart,\r\nbut did not obtain a divorce until approximately seventeen years later, when\r\nMother filed for divorce on the ground of desertion.&nbsp; In the complaint,\r\nMother alleged the following:\r\n\r\n  That there was born to the union\r\n  of this marriage one child, [Nancy], who is now married and no longer\r\n  dependent on [Mother] for support.\r\n\r\nDecedent never answered the\r\ncomplaint and was found in default.\r\nThe divorce matter was referred to a\r\nspecial referee who conducted a hearing in which Mother testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  When were you and [Decedent] married?\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 22, 1944\r\n  Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where were you married?\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; York, South\r\n  Carolina.\r\n  Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe there was one child born to this\r\n  union, and that child is now grown and married?\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nBased on this testimony, the special\r\nreferee made the following finding:\r\n\r\n  The evidence further showed that\r\n  the parties to this action are the parents of one child, who is now grown and\r\n  married, and that since this child is now married, there is no question of\r\n  custody or support.\r\n\r\nThese findings were incorporated\r\ninto the divorce decree.&nbsp; Decedent never contested these findings or\r\nappealed.\r\nOn July 21, 1998, Decedent died\r\nintestate and unmarried.&nbsp; At the hearing to appoint a personal\r\nrepresentative, the probate court received two competing petitions for\r\nappointment: one from Decedentâ€™s siblings, and one from Nancy,\r\nalleging that she was Decedentâ€™s daughter.&nbsp; After considering the\r\nevidence presented, the probate court found that Nancy was Decedentâ€™s daughter and, accordingly,\r\nappointed her as personal representative of the estate. &nbsp;\r\nThereafter, Decedentâ€™s siblings\r\npetitioned the court for a determination of heirs, alleging that Nancy was not Decedentâ€™s daughter.&nbsp;\r\nFollowing the submission of DNA and blood-type evidence, the probate judge ruled\r\nthat Nancy was not Decedentâ€™s child, and therefore not an heir.&nbsp; In\r\naddition, the judge found that the divorce proceeding between Decedent and\r\nMother did not constitute a prior adjudication of paternity.&nbsp; As a result,\r\nthe judge ruled that Nancy was not\r\nDecedentâ€™s child for purposes of intestacy.\r\nNancy appealed and the circuit court\r\naffirmed.&nbsp; Nancy appealed once again, and the court of appeals vacated in part\r\nand reversed and remanded in part.&nbsp; The court of appeals held that the\r\nprobate court did not have jurisdiction to determine paternity.&nbsp; In\r\naddition, the court held that the divorce decree represented a prior\r\nadjudication of paternity, and therefore, Nancy was the Decedentâ€™s child for purposes of intestacy\r\nproceedings. &nbsp;Neely v. Thomasson, 355 S.C. 521, 586 S.E.2d 141 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2003).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis Court granted Decedentâ€™s\r\nsiblingsâ€™ petition for certiorari.&nbsp; The following issues have been raised\r\nfor review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the court of appeals err in\r\n    finding that the probate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\r\n    determine paternity?\r\n  \r\n    Did the court of appeals err in\r\n    finding that the divorce decree constituted a prior, final adjudication of\r\n    paternity?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen a probate court proceeding is\r\nan action at law, the circuit court and the appellate court may not disturb the\r\nprobate courtâ€™s findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses there\r\nis no evidence to support them.&nbsp; Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356,\r\n361, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993). &nbsp;Questions of law, however, may be decided\r\nwith no particular deference to the lower court.&nbsp; Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church\r\nof God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000).\r\nI.&nbsp; Subject Matter\r\nJurisdiction\r\nDecedentâ€™s siblings contend that\r\nthe court of appeals erred in holding that the probate court lacked subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction to determine paternity.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nThis issue involves two seemingly\r\nconflicting statues. &nbsp;The first statute, found in the Probate Code,\r\nprovides as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp; To the full extent\r\n  permitted by the Constitution, and except as otherwise specifically provided\r\n  hereinafter, the court has exclusive original jurisdiction over all\r\n  subject matter related to:\r\n  \r\n    (1) estates of decedents,\r\n    including the contest of wills, construction of wills, and determination\r\n    of heirs and successors of decedents and estates of protected persons .\r\n    . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302 (1987)\r\n(emphases added).&nbsp; â€œHeirsâ€ is defined as â€œthose persons . . . who are\r\nentitled under the statute of intestate succession to the property of a\r\ndecedent.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(17) (1987). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe second statute, found in the\r\nChildrenâ€™s Code and entitled â€œJurisdiction of family court in domestic\r\nmatters,â€ provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  The family court shall have\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction: . . .\r\n  \r\n    (7) To hear and determine\r\n    actions to determine the paternity of an individual.&nbsp;\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(7) (1985)\r\n(emphases added).\r\nThe court of appeals recently held\r\nthat because section 20-7-420(7) states that family courts have exclusive\r\njurisdiction to hear and determine paternity, probate courts lack subject matter\r\njurisdiction to make such determinations.&nbsp; Simmons v. Bellamy, 349\r\nS.C. 473, 476, 562 S.E.2d 687, 689 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; Applying the rule from\r\nSimmons, the court of appeals in the present case held that the probate\r\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to determine whether Nancy\r\nwas Decedentâ€™s biological daughter.&nbsp; As in Simmons, the court\r\nfound that under section 20-7-420(7), family courts have exclusive jurisdiction\r\nto determine paternity.&nbsp;\r\nWe disagree and hold that the court\r\nof appeals erred in finding that the probate court lacked subject matter\r\njurisdiction to decide paternity for the purpose of determining heirs.&nbsp; The\r\nprobate court has â€œexclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter\r\nrelated to . . . [the] determination of heirs.â€ &nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n62-1-302.&nbsp; A determination of heirs may require the probate court to\r\ndetermine consanguineous relationships, including paternity.&nbsp; Provisions\r\nthroughout the Probate Code anticipate such determinations.&nbsp; See, e.g.,\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-107 (1987) (providing that â€œ[r]elatives of the half\r\nblood inherit the same share they would inherit if they were of whole blood . .\r\n. .â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(21) (1987) (defining â€œissueâ€ as â€œlineal\r\ndescendants whether natural or adoptiveâ€).&nbsp; Moreover, as a matter of\r\njudicial economy, the probate court should have the power to make decisions\r\nnecessary to the administration of an estate. Therefore, we hold that probate\r\ncourts have the authority to determine paternity for the purpose of determining\r\nheirs.&nbsp; Cf. Brown v. Ryder Truck Rental, 300 S.C. 530, 533, 389\r\nS.E.2d 161, 163 (Ct. App. 1989) (holding that the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\nCommission has subject matter jurisdiction to determine paternity for the\r\npurpose of determining dependency).[1]&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, the portion of the\r\ncourt of appealsâ€™ decision finding that probate courts lack jurisdiction to\r\ndetermine paternity is reversed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, the court of appealsâ€™\r\ndecision in Simmons v. Bellamy, 349 S.C. 473, 562 S.E.2d 687 (Ct. App.\r\n2002), is overruled.\r\nII.&nbsp; Paternity\r\nAdjudication\r\nDecedentâ€™s siblings contend that\r\nthe court of appeals erred in finding that the divorce decree constituted a\r\nprior, final adjudication of paternity.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nA person born out of wedlock may\r\ninherit from a father who dies intestate if it is determined, â€œin an\r\nadjudication commenced before the death of the father,â€ that the person is the\r\nfatherâ€™s child.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-109(2) (1986).&nbsp; A family\r\ncourt proceeding in which child custody, support, and visitation rights are\r\ndetermined may constitute an adjudication of paternity.&nbsp; Eichman v.\r\nEichman, 285 S.C. 378, 380, 329 S.E.2d 764, 766 (1985).&nbsp; Paternity may\r\nalso be adjudicated in a divorce proceeding. &nbsp;Beyer v. Metze, 326\r\nS.C. 356, 359, 482 S.E.2d 789, 791 (Ct. App. 1997).&nbsp;\r\nIf the issue of paternity was\r\nraised, or could have been raised, in a prior action, a party to that action is\r\nbarred from challenging paternity at a later date.&nbsp; Eichman, 285\r\nS.C. at 380, 329 S.E.2d at 766; but cf. Palm v. Gen. Painting Co., Inc.,\r\n302 S.C. 372, 373, 396 S.E.2d 361, 361 (1990) (noting that a child is not bound\r\nby paternity determinations made in a prior divorce action).&nbsp; Heirs are\r\nbarred from asserting claims that their ancestor would have been barred from\r\nasserting during his lifetime.&nbsp; Watson v. Watson, 172 S.C. 362,\r\n370-71, 174 S.E. 33, 36 (1934); cf. Thompson v. Hudgens, 161 S.C. 450,\r\n463, 159 S.E. 807, 812 (1931) (explaining that heirs are generally in privity\r\nwith their ancestor).\r\nIn Eichman v. Eichman,\r\nhusband and wife were married several months after the birth of the child.&nbsp;\r\n285 S.C. at 379, 329 S.E.2d at 765.&nbsp; A few years later, the couple\r\nseparated, and husband filed an action in family court for a determination of\r\ncustody, support, and visitation rights.&nbsp; The resulting order provided:\r\n\r\n  I also find that a healthy child\r\n  has been born of the marriage, namely [childâ€™s name], and that [husband] is\r\n  a healthy and intelligent father and is capable of earning a sufficient income\r\n  to support himself and the minor child of the parties . . . .\r\n\r\nIn addition, the order granted\r\ncustody to mother, provided that husband would pay $200 per month in child\r\nsupport, and outlined husbandâ€™s visitation rights.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nLater, the couple filed for divorce,\r\nand husband contended that he was not the childâ€™s father.&nbsp; Accordingly,\r\nhe asked the family court to order the necessary paternity tests.&nbsp; The\r\ncourt denied husbandâ€™s request, and this Court affirmed, stating â€œThere can\r\nbe no question but that these same parties were previously before the court\r\nrelative to the same subject matter and that an adjudication was made.â€&nbsp; Id. at 380, 329 S.E.2d at 766 (emphasis\r\nadded).&nbsp; Accordingly, husband was barred from raising the paternity issue\r\nin a later action.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nSimilarly, in Beyer v. Metze,\r\nthe divorce decree stated that three childrenâ€”two who had wifeâ€™s last name\r\nand one who had husbandâ€™s last nameâ€”were born during the marriage.&nbsp; 326\r\nS.C. at 358, 482 S.E.2d at 790. &nbsp;Wife was granted custody and husband was\r\nordered to pay support in the amount of $25 per week for each child, totaling\r\n$75 per week.&nbsp; Husband did not challenge or appeal the decree.&nbsp;\r\nApproximately thirteen years later, DSS filed a petition to collect support,\r\ntotaling $48,675.&nbsp; Id. at 358, 482 S.E.2d at 791.&nbsp; Husband contended that\r\ntwo of the children were not his and asked the court to order blood tests.&nbsp;\r\nIn response, DSS contended that paternity had been adjudicated during the\r\ndivorce proceeding and therefore husband was estopped from challenging paternity\r\nin a later action. &nbsp;\r\nThe court of appeals agreed and held\r\nthat â€œ[t]he wording [in the decree], read in conjunction with the provisions\r\nallowing [husband] visitation of the children and requiring him to pay support\r\nfor them, clearly implies paternity.â€&nbsp; Id. at 359, 482 S.E.2d at 791 (emphasis\r\nadded). &nbsp;Accordingly, the court held that because paternity â€œhad\r\npreviously been determined in an order which was neither challenged nor\r\nappealed,â€ the family court properly denied husbandâ€™s request to order blood\r\ntests.&nbsp; Id.\r\nIn the present case, Decedent and\r\nMother married several months after Nancy was born.&nbsp; On Nancyâ€™s birth\r\ncertificate, Decedent is listed as the father, and Nancy was given his last name. &nbsp;When the couple separated,\r\nDecedent signed an agreement acknowledging that he was Nancyâ€™s father.&nbsp; The agreement gave\r\nDecedent â€œthe right and privilege to see and visit with his infant daughter at\r\nany reasonable time or place.â€&nbsp;\r\nSeveral years later, when the couple\r\ndivorced, the complaint alleged that â€œthere was born to the union of this\r\nmarriage one child.â€&nbsp; According to the affidavit and proof of service\r\ncontained in the record, Decedent was personally served with the divorce\r\ncomplaint.&nbsp; After the time expired for Decedent to answer the complaint or\r\notherwise plead, Wifeâ€™s attorney filed an affidavit of default.&nbsp;\r\nA hearing was conducted before a\r\nspecial referee.&nbsp; Decedent did not appear at the hearing.&nbsp; The special\r\nreferee found that Decedent and Mother were â€œthe parents of one child, who is\r\nnow grown and married.â€&nbsp; The special referee also found that, because the\r\nchild is married, â€œthere is no question of custody or support.â€ &nbsp;These\r\nfindings were adopted by the circuit court judge who issued the final divorce\r\ndecree.&nbsp; Decedent did not appeal.&nbsp;\r\nBecause the court found that one\r\nchild was born during the marriage, and that Decedent was the parent of that\r\nchild, we find that the issue of paternity was adjudicated in the divorce\r\nproceeding.&nbsp; The fact that the order did not outline specific provisions\r\nregarding custody and support, like the orders in Eichman and Beyer,\r\ndoes not undermine our finding.&nbsp; As the special referee explained, there\r\nwas no need to outline such provisions because the child was grown and\r\nmarried.&nbsp; Moreover, Decedent and Mother had resolved custody and support\r\nissues in the separation agreement signed years ago.&nbsp; Therefore, we hold\r\nthat the divorce proceedings constituted a prior adjudication of paternity.\r\nBecause the issue of paternity was\r\nraised and ruled upon in a prior action, Decedent, if alive, would have been\r\nbarred from challenging paternity at a later date.&nbsp; See Eichman, 285\r\nS.C. at 380, 329 S.E.2d at 766.&nbsp; As a result, Decedentâ€™s heirs are\r\nlikewise barred from asserting claims that Decedent himself would have been\r\nbarred from asserting.&nbsp; See Watson, 172 S.C. at 370-71, 174 S.E. at\r\n36. &nbsp;Moreover, we find that it would be unjust to allow Decedentâ€™s\r\nsiblings to assert a claim that Decedent himself never chose to assert during\r\nhis lifetime.&nbsp; In fact, there is no evidence in the record that Decedent\r\ntook any steps whatsoever during his lifetime to disclaim Nancy as his daughter.&nbsp; To the contrary, Decedent acknowledged,\r\non more than one occasion, that Nancy\r\nwas his child.&nbsp; Therefore, we hold that Decedentâ€™s siblings should not\r\nhave been permitted to challenge the prior paternity determination.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, the court of appealsâ€™\r\ndecision finding that the divorce decree constituted a prior, final adjudication\r\nof paternity is affirmed.&nbsp; As a result, Nancy\r\nis Decedentâ€™s child for purposes of intestacy proceedings.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe hold that the court of appeals\r\nerred in finding that the probate court lacked jurisdiction to determine\r\npaternity for the purpose of determining heirs.&nbsp; Nonetheless, because a\r\nprior adjudication of paternity had been made, the probate court erred in\r\nallowing Decedentâ€™s siblings to challenge paternity during the administration\r\nof the estate.&nbsp; For this reason, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision\r\nfinding that the divorce action constituted a prior, final adjudication of\r\npaternity. &nbsp;Therefore, the court of appealsâ€™ decision is affirmed in part\r\nand reversed in part.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN\r\nPART\r\nMOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1] We note that the General Assembly recently passed legislation\r\ngiving family and probate courts concurrent jurisdiction to determine\r\npaternity.&nbsp; The Probate Code has been amended to read:&nbsp; â€œThe courtâ€™s\r\njurisdiction to hear and determine paternity matters and validity of marriages\r\nof decedents is concurrent with that of the family court . . . .â€&nbsp; S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(c) (2005).&nbsp; And the Childrenâ€™s Code now reads: â€œThe\r\nfamily court and the probate court of each county have concurrent jurisdiction\r\nto hear and determine matters concerning the validity of marriages of decedents\r\nand paternity of an individual.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(B)\r\n(2005).&nbsp; Our decision today, however, is based not on these amendments, but\r\non the reasoning set forth in this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26025","title":"Bright v.

Â Respondent applied for post-conviction relief (PCR), and following a hearing, relief was granted on the basis that the plea was not freely and voluntarily given.Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nThe parties do not dispute the facts in this case.Â  After moving from Florida to South Carolina, Respondent went to live with his half-sister and her husband.Â  Eventually, Respondent moved across the street to live with his mother.\r\nOne day, while at his half-sisterâ€™s house, Respondent and his half-sister got into an argument.Â  At some point during the argument, Respondent left the house and went to his motherâ€™s house to get a shotgun and shotgun shells.Â  When he returned to his half-sisterâ€™s house, he pointed the shotgun at her, restrained her with a bathrobe belt, and made her get down on the floor.Â  A couple of hours later, his half-sisterâ€™s husband came home to find Respondent holding his half-sister at gunpoint.Â  Respondent pointed the gun at the husband and told his half-sister to tie up her husband with an extension cord.Â  Later, Respondentâ€™s mother arrived, and she, too, was tied up.\r\nWhile the three were tied up, Respondent questioned them about family matters.Â  Several hours later, satisfied that he had learned all of the information that he wanted, Respondent told his half-sister to call the police and she did.Â  Respondent surrendered when the police arrived. \r\nDuring the plea hearing, Respondent said, â€œ[i]tâ€™s true that I did what Iâ€™m accused of doing, your honor.Â  No one regrets it more than I do.Â  I hesitate to say exactly what prompted me to do all of it, and I was provoked in part by my family members.â€Â  A plea agreement was reached, which provided that if Respondent pled guilty, he would be charged with only one count of kidnapping and three counts of pointing a firearm.Â Â  Accordingly, Respondent pled guilty to one charge of kidnapping and three charges of pointing a firearm and was sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment for kidnapping and five years for each count of pointing a firearm, to be served concurrently with the kidnapping sentence.[1]Â  Respondent applied for PCR, and following a hearing at which plea counsel did not appear, relief was granted on the basis that the plea was not freely and voluntarily given.Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari to review the following issue:\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR court err in finding that counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the plea proceeding?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995)).&nbsp; On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.&nbsp; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).&nbsp; If no probative evidence exists to support the findings, this Court will reverse.&nbsp; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000) (citing Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996)).\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nThe state contends that the PCR judge erred in granting Respondent relief.Â  We agree.Â  To prove that counsel was ineffective when a guilty plea is challenged, petitioner must show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability a guilty plea would not have been entered.Â  Griffin v. State, 361 S.C. 173, 176-77, 604 S.E.2d 394, 396 (2004).\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Respondent testified that counsel (1) did not take enough time to meet with him; (2) did not inform Respondent about his right to a bail hearing, a bond hearing, or preliminary hearing; and (3) admitted Respondentâ€™s guilt without Respondentâ€™s consent.Â  Based on this testimony, the PCR court made the following findings:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counsel did not adequately consider the grave nature of the indictments and failed to meet with and inform Respondent in a manner that would allow Respondent to make informed and voluntary decisions regarding his defense; \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counsel waived Respondentâ€™s substantive and procedural rights without Respondentâ€™s knowledge or consent; and \r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondentâ€™s plea was not freely and voluntarily made because he was not adequately informed of his procedural rights and defenses, and was erroneously counseled to give affirmative responses to the trial judge during the plea.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the PCR court found that Respondent would not have pled guilty but for counselâ€™s error.Â Â  \r\nWe find no evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s findings.Â  The record indicates that counsel met with Respondent on two separate occasions.Â  Although Respondentâ€™s plea counsel did not appear at the PCR hearing, at the plea hearing, counsel stated, â€œI have taken some time, as Iâ€™m required to do, to go over with him the elements of the charges and how his actions would have satisfied those elements, both on pointing and kidnapping.â€Â  Counsel also explained that he talked â€œa lotâ€ with Respondent about taking the stand and giving his version of the facts, which were identical to the stateâ€™s version.Â  In addition, at the plea hearing, Respondent said that he was satisfied with his counselâ€™s services, did not have any problems with counselâ€™s representation, and that he regretted his crimes.Â  Accordingly, we find that counsel was not ineffective.\r\nMoreover, we find that counselâ€™s plea negotiations for Respondent proved advantageous.Â  Counsel successfully negotiated a plea agreement in which two kidnapping and one criminal sexual conduct charge were dropped.Â  Moreover, the solicitor agreed to ask for twenty-years imprisonment for the kidnapping charge, instead of the thirty years maximum statutory sentence.Â  Finally, the solicitor asked that the sentences attaching to the pointing-a-firearm charges be served concurrent to the kidnapping charge.Â  Therefore, counsel negotiated a favorable plea on Respondentâ€™s behalf.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s ruling and reinstate Respondentâ€™s convictions and sentence.\r\nREVERSED\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent did not receive the maximum sentence for these crimes.Â  For example, he could have received thirty-years imprisonment - the maximum sentence - for one charge of kidnapping alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26026","title":"Cobb v.

Royal Surplus Lines, 341 S.C. 68, 533 S.E.2d 331\r\n(2000); Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 313 S.C. 98, 431 S.E.2d 587 (1993); see\r\nalso Pelfrey v. Bank of Greer, 270 S.C. 691, 244 S.E.2d 315 (1978)\r\n(an order allowing a jury trial is immediately appealable where there is no such\r\nentitlement as a matter of right).&nbsp; DOT asserts there is no right to a jury\r\ntrial in an inverse condemnation case and therefore Judge Fewâ€™s order is\r\nimmediately appealable.\r\nAlthough there are several appellate\r\ndecisions involving jury trials in inverse condemnation cases,[2] we have never addressed the issue whether a\r\nlandowner is entitled to a jury trial as a matter of right.&nbsp; The\r\nconstitutional right to a jury trial is found in article I, Â§ 14, of&nbsp; the\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution which states that â€œthe right of trial by jury\r\nshall be preserved inviolate.â€&nbsp; The right to a jury trial is protected\r\nunder this provision only if such a right existed in 1868 when our constitution\r\nwas adopted.&nbsp; State v. Gibbes, 109 S.C. 135, 95 S.E. 346 (1918); see\r\nalso &nbsp;Unisys Corp. v. South Carolina Budget and Control Bd., 346\r\nS.C. 158, 551 S.E.2d 263 (2001) (no constitutional right to a jury trial in an\r\naction against the sovereign not recognized at time constitution was\r\nadopted).&nbsp; We have specifically held there is no constitutional right to a\r\njury trial in an eminent domain case because there was no such right when our\r\nconstitution was adopted.&nbsp; Gilmer v. Hunnicutt, 57 S.C. 166, 35 S.E.\r\n521 (1900).&nbsp;\r\nThis constitutional analysis applies\r\nwith equal force in the analogous context of an inverse condemnation\r\naction.&nbsp; In eminent domain proceedings, a governmental entity is the moving\r\nparty seeking to take property in exchange for compensation.&nbsp; In inverse\r\ncondemnation cases, the property owner is the moving party claiming an act of\r\nthe sovereign has damaged his property to the extent of an actual taking\r\nentitling him to compensation.&nbsp; South Carolina State Hwy. Depâ€™t v. Moody, 267 S.C. 130, 226\r\nS.E.2d 423 (1976).&nbsp; These actions are treated alike under the takings\r\nclause of our State Constitution.[3]&nbsp;\r\nE.g., Spradley v. South Carolina State Hwy. Depâ€™t, 256 S.C. 431,\r\n182 S.E.2d 735 (1971); South Carolina State Hwy. Depâ€™t v. Moody, supra;\r\nKing v. South Carolina State Hwy. Depâ€™t, 248 S.C. 64, 149 S.E.2d 64\r\n(1966); Milhous v. State Hwy. Depâ€™t, 194 S.C. 33, 8 S.E.2d 852 (1940); Chick\r\nSprings Water Co. v. State Hwy. Depâ€™t, 159 S.C. 481, 157 S.E. 842\r\n(1931).&nbsp; Because an eminent domain action and an inverse condemnation\r\naction are treated equally under our constitution, we hold there is no\r\nconstitutional right to a jury trial in an inverse condemnation case just as no\r\nsuch right exists in an eminent domain case.&nbsp; Other courts have used this\r\nanalysis to reach this same conclusion.&nbsp; See Cumberland Farms,\r\nInc. v. Town of Groton, 808 A.2d 1107 (Conn.\r\n2002); Depâ€™t of Ag. and Consumer Servs. v. Bonnano, 568 So.2d 24 (Fla. 1990); cf. Housing Fin. and Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson,\r\n979 P.2d 1107 (Hawaiâ€™i 1999) (right\r\nto jury trial existed in 1959 when state constitution was adopted).&nbsp;\r\nDespite the fact there is no\r\nconstitutional right to a jury in an eminent domain case, such a right is\r\nprovided by statute.&nbsp; South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-310 (1991) provides\r\nin an eminent domain action a property owner or the condemnor may elect a jury\r\ntrial on the issue of compensation.&nbsp; In light of the historical treatment\r\nof an inverse condemnation action as equivalent to an eminent domain case, we\r\nconclude this statutory right to a jury trial on the issue of compensation\r\napplies as well in inverse condemnation actions.&nbsp; See State\r\nv. Bridgers, 329 S.C. 11, 495 S.E.2d 196 (1997) (General Assembly is\r\npresumed to be aware of the common law when enacting legislation); accord\r\nBrock v. State Hwy. Commâ€™n, 404 P.2d 934 (Kan.\r\n1965) (in inverse condemnation action same rules apply as in condemnation\r\nproceeding).&nbsp; Accordingly, in an inverse condemnation case, the trial judge\r\nwill determine whether a claim has been established; the issue of compensation\r\nmay then be submitted to a jury at either partyâ€™s request.[4]&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nLandowners are entitled to a jury\r\ntrial in the compensation phase as provided in Judge Fewâ€™s order.&nbsp; DOT\r\ntherefore has not been deprived of a mode of trial to which it is entitled as a\r\nmatter of right.&nbsp; Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of DOTâ€™s\r\nappeal.&nbsp; DOTâ€™s contention that it is entitled to a bifurcated proceeding\r\nin order to allow it to â€œundoâ€ its actions as an alternative to compensation\r\nis an issue that is not before us since there has been no ruling below.&nbsp; Humbert\r\nv. State, 345 S.C. 332, 548 S.E.2d 862 (2001) (issues not ruled upon in the\r\ntrial court will not be considered on appeal).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]See Cook v.

Appellant\r\nwas convicted of two counts of homicide by child abuse for the deaths of two\r\ninfants in her home daycare.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant and her husband Josh Cutro\r\noperated a home daycare in Irmo, South\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; Between January and September of 1993, two infants, Parker\r\nColson and Ashlan Daniel, died at the Cutrosâ€™ home.&nbsp; A third infant,\r\nAsher Maier, became ill while at their home and was subsequently diagnosed with\r\nserious brain damage.&nbsp; The State produced evidence that all three infants\r\nwere victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome.&nbsp; Appellant was convicted of two\r\ncounts of homicide by child abuse and sentenced to concurrent life sentences for\r\nkilling Parker Colson and Ashlan Daniel; she was acquitted of the assault and\r\nbattery charge regarding Asher Maier.\r\nThe Stateâ€™s theory of the case was\r\nthat appellantâ€™s actions were motivated by Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP),\r\nwhich the Stateâ€™s medical experts defined as a form of child abuse in which\r\nthe perpetrator harms a child in order to garner sympathy and attention for\r\nherself.[1]\r\nParker Colson\r\nParker Colson was almost five months\r\nold when he was found dead in his crib at the Cutrosâ€™ home on January 4,\r\n1993.&nbsp; According to his parents, Parker was a healthy baby and had no\r\nhealth problems that morning.&nbsp; His mother dropped him off at the Cutrosâ€™\r\ndaycare at about 7:30 a.m.&nbsp; At 1:57 p.m., emergency personnel received a\r\ncall to the Cutrosâ€™ home.&nbsp; When they arrived at 2:11 p.m., Parker was not\r\nbreathing.&nbsp; He was rushed to the hospital where he was declared dead.\r\nParkerâ€™s mother testified that\r\nappellant told her the following regarding Parkerâ€™s death:\r\n\r\n  A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  She told me that Parker was taking a nap.&nbsp; She went in and checked on\r\n  him.&nbsp; He was asleep.&nbsp; She went in the kitchen, reached up in the\r\n  cabinet to get his food down.&nbsp; Josh came in behind her and screamed,\r\n  Parkerâ€™s not breathing, call 9-1-1.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  After she left the room where Parker was and went into the kitchen, how long a\r\n  period of time did she indicate it was before Josh entered the room and\r\n  screamed?\r\n  A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The way she explained it to me was she checked on Parker, walked in the\r\n  kitchen, and reached in the cabinet.&nbsp; Josh walked in behind her and\r\n  screamed, Parkerâ€™s not breathing, call 9-1-1 â€“ however long it takes to\r\n  get from the living room into the kitchen and reach into a cabinet, a few\r\n  seconds.&nbsp; And her kitchen was right beside the living room.\r\n  Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  So according to Gail Cutro, who was the last person who had contact with your\r\n  son Parker before Josh Cutro found him not breathing?\r\n  A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Gail.\r\n\r\nAfter an autopsy, the coronerâ€™s\r\noffice reported Parkerâ€™s cause of death as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or\r\nâ€œSIDS,â€ which is the diagnosis given when an infantâ€™s cause of death\r\ncannot be identified.&nbsp; Dr. Daniel, who performed the autopsy, did note the\r\npresence of petechial hemorrhages in the cortical section of Parkerâ€™s brain\r\nwhich she testified was unusual in a SIDS case.\r\nIn July 1994, Parkerâ€™s body was\r\nexhumed and re-autopsied.&nbsp; Dr. Ophoven, who reviewed the autopsy report,\r\nconcluded that the presence of the petechial hemorrhages in Parkerâ€™s brain and\r\na sub-dural hematoma, which had not been discovered in the original autopsy,\r\nindicated Parker died a traumatic death caused by shaking and asphyxia.&nbsp;\r\nDr. Gilbert-Barness testified that Parker died of Shaken Baby Syndrome which\r\ndamaged the medulla causing the heart and respiration to stop.\r\nOther medical testimony indicated\r\nthat Shaken Baby Syndrome can occur with no external sign of trauma.&nbsp;\r\nBecause a babyâ€™s brain is not fully developed, violent shaking damages the\r\nvital center of the brain that controls breathing which can cause death by\r\nasphyxiation.&nbsp; The presence of petechial hemorrhages indicates\r\nasphyxia.&nbsp; Expert testimony further indicated that the symptoms of Shaken\r\nBaby Syndrome manifest immediately after the shaking -- head injury occurs\r\nwithin seconds and a baby might die immediately.\r\nAsher Maier\r\nAsher Maier was four months old when\r\nhe began daycare with the Cutros on June 7, 1993.&nbsp; A couple of days after\r\nbeginning daycare, Asher became irritable and stopped sleeping through the\r\nnight.&nbsp; He was fussy on June 23 when his mother dropped him off at the\r\nCutrosâ€™ at about 7:30 a.m.&nbsp; Between 10:30 and 10:50 a.m., Mrs. Maier\r\nreceived a telephone call at work from appellant stating that the baby was â€œinconsolableâ€\r\nand suggesting she pick him up and take him to the doctor.&nbsp; When Mrs. Maier\r\narrived at the Cutrosâ€™ a short time later, the baby was already in his car\r\nseat and they immediately handed him to her.&nbsp; Asher remained in his car\r\nseat until he was in the doctorâ€™s office.&nbsp; When Mrs. Maier removed him,\r\nshe discovered Asher was limp and unable to control his neck.&nbsp; Another\r\nchildâ€™s parent had seen Asher that morning in daycare and testified he was\r\nmoving normally at that time.&nbsp;\r\nDr. Alexander, who reviewed Asherâ€™s\r\nmedical records, testified in his opinion Asher had been the victim of two\r\nshaking episodes.&nbsp; An MRI and CT scan revealed old and new blood in his\r\nbrain indicating an earlier episode, probably two weeks previous, that had\r\nhealed to some extent.&nbsp; Asher also exhibited retinal hemorrhages indicative\r\nof Shaken Baby Syndrome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAshlan Daniel\r\nAshlan Daniel was about two months\r\nold when she began daycare with the Cutros in June 1993.&nbsp; Ashlan was in\r\ndaycare for about only two hours a day while Mrs. Daniel worked part-time.&nbsp;\r\nOn September 9, 1993, Mrs. Daniel dropped Ashlan off at the Cutrosâ€™ at\r\nnoon.&nbsp; A picture of Ashlan taken earlier that day shows she was a healthy\r\nand normal baby, a description her parents corroborated.&nbsp;\r\nWhen Mrs. Daniel left work at 2:30\r\np.m., she went to pick Ashlan up at the Cutrosâ€™ home.&nbsp; She pulled up as EMS\r\npersonnel were arriving.&nbsp; Josh Cutro came out of the house and told Mrs.\r\nDaniel that Ashlan was dead.\r\nAshlanâ€™s mother testified that\r\nappellant told her that she, appellant, found Ashlan not breathing and Josh was\r\nout of the house at that time.&nbsp; Another parent testified appellant told her\r\nJosh went to pick up their children from school and that she, appellant, was the\r\nonly adult in the room when Ashlan stopped breathing.&nbsp;\r\nOther parents of the Cutrosâ€™\r\ndaycare children also testified.&nbsp; One parent testified Josh told her he had\r\njust returned home when appellant came outside to tell him about the baby.&nbsp;\r\nAnother testified that appellant told her that she, appellant, â€œwas in the\r\nroom with Ashlan when she died. . . and that she couldnâ€™t believe that she\r\ndidnâ€™t notice that [Ashlan] had stopped breathing.â€&nbsp;\r\nDr. Reynolds, who autopsied Ashlanâ€™s\r\nbody, testified petechial hemorrhages were present in her brain, which he had\r\nnever seen in a SIDS death.&nbsp; Because he could not determine the cause of\r\ndeath, he concluded it was SIDS.&nbsp;\r\nAshlanâ€™s body was exhumed and\r\nre-autopsied in July 1994.&nbsp; Dr. Ophoven testified that Ashlanâ€™s brain had\r\na subdural hematoma which, in addition to the petechial hemorrhages, indicated\r\nshe had died of trauma and asphyxia.&nbsp; Dr. Gilbert-Barness concurred and\r\nstated that these injuries indicated Shaken Baby Syndrome.&nbsp;\r\nEvidence of MSBP\r\nAs proof of motive, the State\r\nintroduced evidence of appellantâ€™s attention-seeking behavior regarding the\r\npurported SIDS deaths of the two infants who died in her daycare.&nbsp; She kept\r\ntheir obituaries, photos, and items of clothing, as well as frequently visiting\r\ntheir gravesites and emotionally discussing their deaths repeatedly with\r\nothers.&nbsp; Appellant also fabricated that she had lost one of her own\r\nchildren and that a baby had died in her care in 1992.&nbsp; The Stateâ€™s\r\nmedical experts opined that the injuries to the three infants and appellantâ€™s\r\nbehavior indicated a pattern of child abuse identified as MSBP.&nbsp;\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Was appellant unfairly prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s refusal to sever the\r\n  charges?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Was appellant unfairly prejudiced by evidence used to prove MSBP?\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Were autopsy reports of other infants improperly admitted?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.&nbsp; Joinder of charges\r\nAppellant was first tried in 1994\r\nand convicted of killing Ashlan Daniel.&nbsp; We reversed that conviction\r\nbecause evidence of the death and injury to the other two infants, Parker Colson\r\nand Asher Maier, was not clear and convincing and therefore was improperly\r\nadmitted as Lyle[2]\r\nevidence.&nbsp; State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 504 S.E.2d 324&nbsp; (1998)\r\n(Cutro I ).[3]&nbsp; Appellant\r\ncontends the trial judge erred in denying her motion to sever the charges in\r\nthis case based on our holding in Cutro I.&nbsp; For the reasons set\r\nforth below, we find our evidentiary ruling in Cutro I is not controlling\r\nhere.\r\nGenerally, when offenses charged in\r\nseparate indictments are of the same general nature involving connected\r\ntransactions closely related in kind, place, and character,[4] the trial judge has the discretion to order the\r\nindictments tried together, but only so long as the defendantâ€™s substantive\r\nrights are not prejudiced.&nbsp; State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282\r\nS.E.2d 838 (1981); State v. Williams, 263 S.C. 290, 210 S.E.2d 298\r\n(1974); McCrary v. State, 249 S.C. 14, 152 S.E.2d 235 (1969).&nbsp; We\r\nhave found prejudice where the defendant was jointly tried on charges for which\r\nthe evidence would not otherwise have been admissible under Lyle.&nbsp; State\r\nv. Smith, 322 S.C. 107, 470 S.E.2d 364 (1996).&nbsp; We now clarify that in\r\ndetermining joinder, the trial judge need not find clear and convincing evidence\r\nof the charges.\r\na.&nbsp; Distinction between\r\nevidentiary and joinder context\r\nIn the context of evidentiary law, Lyle\r\nand its progeny protect a defendant from the unrestricted admission of bad act\r\nevidence.&nbsp; Lyle prohibits such evidence unless the evidence has a\r\nparticular relevance to the crime charged and falls within at least one of five\r\ncategories:&nbsp; motive, identity, common scheme or plan, absence of mistake or\r\naccident, or intent.[5]&nbsp;\r\nFurther, bad acts that are not the subject of conviction must be proved by clear\r\nand convincing evidence.&nbsp; State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d\r\n827 (2001).&nbsp; This preliminary fact-finding by the judge ensures the\r\nevidence is subjected to some procedural safeguard before the jury hears it.\r\nIn the context of the joinder of\r\ncharges for a jury trial, however, procedural safeguards are already in place\r\nthat eliminate the need for preliminary fact-finding by the trial judge.&nbsp;\r\nBefore a defendant is tried on joint charges, the charges are investigated by\r\nlaw enforcement and subject to judicial procedures such as indictment and\r\npreliminary hearing.&nbsp; In this procedural context, it is unnecessary to hold\r\na â€œmini-trialâ€ for the State to prove each charge to the judge before\r\nproceeding with a joint trial to the jury.&nbsp; Accord Solomon v.\r\nState, 646 A.2d 1064 (Md. App.\r\n1995) (Moylan, J.).&nbsp;\r\nFurther, in the evidentiary context,\r\nbad act evidence that falls within a Lyle exception and meets the clear\r\nand convincing standard may still be excluded if the danger of unfair prejudice\r\nsubstantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence.&nbsp; State v.\r\nBraxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001).&nbsp; Similarly, in the\r\njoinder context, the defendant may argue unfair prejudice if, after the Stateâ€™s\r\ncase, the trial judge determines that a directed verdict should be\r\ngranted.&nbsp; The standard for submission of charges to the jury is â€œany\r\nsubstantial evidence.â€&nbsp; State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 84, 512\r\nS.E.2d 795, 798 (1999).&nbsp; If the trial judge finds there is no substantial\r\nevidence to submit any one of the joined charges to the jury, the defendant may\r\nmove for a mistrial on the basis of unfair prejudice resulting from joinder.&nbsp;\r\nb.&nbsp; Application of joinder\r\nstandard\r\nHere, according to the Stateâ€™s\r\ncase, all three offenses are similar in kind, place, and character -- each\r\ninvolves Shaken Baby Syndrome inflicted on an infant in the Cutrosâ€™\r\ndaycare.&nbsp; These offenses clearly fit within the Lyle categories for\r\ncommon scheme or plan and motive.&nbsp; We conclude the charges were properly\r\ntried jointly.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n2.&nbsp; Evidence of MSBP\r\nAppellant contends evidence\r\nconcerning the memorabilia seized from her home regarding the two dead infants\r\nwas unfairly prejudicial and improperly admitted at trial.&nbsp; The State\r\nintroduced the babiesâ€™ memorabilia as indicative of MSBP which is marked by\r\nattention-seeking behavior.&nbsp; The trial judge charged the jury that it was\r\nto consider the diagnosis and evidence of MSBP only for the limited purpose of\r\nestablishing motive or absence of illness, mistake, or accident.&nbsp;\r\nAppellant claims exclusion of this\r\nevidence is mandated under State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 501 S.E.2d 716\r\n(1998), which held that â€œpropensity evidenceâ€ is inadmissible.&nbsp; We find\r\nNelson distinguishable.&nbsp; In that case, childrenâ€™s toys, videos,\r\nphotographs of young girls, and other evidence tending to depict the defendant\r\nas a pedophile were admitted at his trial for criminal sexual conduct and\r\ncommitting lewd acts on a minor.&nbsp; We held this evidence should have been\r\nexcluded because character evidence is not admissible â€œfor purposes of proving\r\nthat the accused possesses a criminal character or has a propensity to commit\r\nthe crime with which he is charged.â€ Nelson, 331 S.C. at 6, 501 S.E.2d\r\nat 719.&nbsp;\r\nIn this case, the evidence is not\r\ngeneral propensity evidence but indicates appellantâ€™s behavior regarding the\r\ndeaths of these two infants.&nbsp; Since the Stateâ€™s theory of the case was\r\nthat appellant killed the victims to gain sympathy and attention for herself,\r\nthis evidence is relevant to show motive.&nbsp; See State v. Hocevar,\r\n7 P.3d 329 (Mont. 2000) (evidence of\r\nMSBP admissible on issue of motive).&nbsp; Further, in Nelson the\r\nevidence was admitted simply to depict the defendant as a pedophile.&nbsp; There\r\nwas no expert testimony relating the contested evidence to the charges as in\r\nthis case.\r\nFinally, collecting memorabilia of a\r\ndeceased child, while perhaps uncommon, is not behavior that itself indicates a\r\nbad character.&nbsp; In fact, appellant presented extensive evidence that her\r\ngrief was a normal response to the deaths of these children.&nbsp; This evidence\r\ndid not unfairly suggest that appellant had a propensity to commit crimes\r\nagainst children.&nbsp; See State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382,\r\n401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991) (evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it has an undue\r\ntendency to suggest decision on an improper basis).&nbsp; We conclude appellant\r\nwas not unfairly prejudiced by the admission of this evidence.[6]\r\n3.&nbsp; Autopsy reports of\r\nother SIDS deaths\r\nThe Stateâ€™s medical expert, Dr.\r\nOphoven, testified she examined the autopsy reports of all SIDS deaths that\r\noccurred under one year of age in South\r\nCarolina since 1993.&nbsp; These 274 autopsy reports were marked as Stateâ€™s\r\nexhibits for identification during Dr. Ophovenâ€™s testimony along with a chart\r\nsummarizing them.&nbsp; Dr. Ophoven testified that none of these autopsy reports\r\nnoted petechial hemorrhages of the brain which are considered medical\r\nabnormalities that would ordinarily be documented in the course of an\r\nautopsy.&nbsp; She testified that the autopsies of Parker Colson and Ashlan\r\nDaniel were the only two in which such abnormalities were found, confirming her\r\nearlier observation that petechial hemorrhages do not occur in a SIDS\r\ndeath.&nbsp;\r\nAppellant contends evidence\r\nconcerning the autopsy reports of&nbsp; these other SIDS deaths was irrelevant,\r\nwas inadmissible hearsay, and violated her confrontation rights.&nbsp;\r\nEvidence is relevant if it tends to\r\nmake the existence of any fact at issue more or less probable.&nbsp; State v.\r\nFrazier, 357 S.C. 161, 592 S.E.2d 621 (2004); Rule 404, SCRE.&nbsp; Here,\r\nmedical testimony created an issue regarding the significance of petechial\r\nhemorrhages in determining the cause of death of the two infants.&nbsp; The fact\r\nthat autopsies of SIDS deaths did not note this type of brain abnormality was\r\nrelevant in distinguishing a SIDS case from a traumatic death.\r\nFurther, autopsy reports are not\r\nhearsay under Rule 803, SCRE.&nbsp; Subsection (8) of this rule excepts from\r\nhearsay public records and reports containing matters there is a duty to\r\nreport.&nbsp; Autopsies are required in cases of SIDS if law enforcement deems\r\nit necessary.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-5-540 (2003) and Â§ 20-7-5915 (Supp.\r\n2004).&nbsp; Additionally, subsection (9) of Rule 803 specifically exempts from\r\nhearsay records of vital statistics, including â€œreports. . . of . . . deaths.\r\n. . if the report thereof was made to a public office pursuant to requirements\r\nof law.â€&nbsp; Autopsy reports are required to be kept by the medical examinerâ€™s\r\noffice.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-5-280 ( 2003).&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, an\r\nautopsy report is not inadmissible hearsay.&nbsp;\r\nIn addition, Rule 703, SCRE,\r\nspecifically provides:\r\n\r\n  The facts or data in the\r\n  particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be\r\n  those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of\r\n  a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming\r\n  opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be\r\n  admissible in evidence.\r\n\r\nWe conclude evidence of the autopsy\r\nreports was admissible under the Rules of Evidence.\r\nFinally, in Crawford v.\r\nWashington, 541 U.S. 36, 54 (2004), the United States Supreme Court noted\r\nthe hearsay exception for business records and observed that business records\r\nare not â€œtestimonialâ€ and therefore do not implicate the Confrontation\r\nClause.&nbsp; A public record, very much like a business record, is not\r\ntestimonial and its admission similarly does not violate the defendantâ€™s\r\nconfrontation rights.&nbsp; Moreover, appellant was able to cross-examine Dr.\r\nOphoven regarding the possible inaccuracies in these autopsy reports and\r\npresented extensive expert testimony reinterpreting the significance of their\r\nfindings.[7]&nbsp; We find appellantâ€™s\r\nconfrontation rights were not infringed.\r\nWe hold the trial judge did not err\r\nin allowing Dr. Ophovenâ€™s testimony regarding the autopsies of other deaths.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellantâ€™s remaining issues are\r\nwithout merit and are disposed of pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the\r\nfollowing authority:&nbsp; Issue 4:&nbsp; State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159,\r\n508 S.E.2d 870 (1998) (for this Court to reverse based on erroneous exclusion of\r\nevidence, prejudice must be shown; error is harmless when it could not\r\nreasonably have affected result of the trial);&nbsp; State v. Beckham,\r\n334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999) (any error in exclusion of cumulative\r\nevidence is harmless); Issue 5:&nbsp; State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 512\r\nS.E.2d 795 (1999) (if there is any substantial evidence tending to prove the\r\nguilt of the accused, or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced,\r\nthe case should be submitted to the jury); State v. Brown, 360 S.C. 581,\r\n602 S.E.2d 392 (2004) (on appeal from denial of directed verdict, this Court\r\nmust view the evidence in light most favorable to the State); Issue 6:&nbsp; State\r\nv. Hyder, 242 S.C. 372, 131 S.E.2d 96 (1963); State v. Caulder, 287\r\nS.C. 507, 339 S.E.2d 876 (Ct. App. 1986) (no error to refuse a charge on mere\r\nsuspicion where the charge adequately instructs the jury regarding reasonable\r\ndoubt); Issue 7:&nbsp; State v. Mitchell, 362 S.C. 289, 608 S.E.2d 140\r\n(Ct. App. 2005) (involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included offense of\r\nhomicide by child abuse under the elements test); Issue 8:&nbsp; State v.\r\nPauling, 322 S.C. 95, 470 S.E.2d 106 (1996) (if jury asks for further\r\nexplanation of the law after indicating deadlock, the requirements of Â§\r\n14-7-1330 are met).&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT,\r\nJJ., concur.&nbsp; PLEICONES, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; I\r\nrespectfully dissent.&nbsp; As I understand appellantâ€™s joinder argument, she\r\ncontends that the charges were improperly consolidated for trial.&nbsp; I agree,\r\nand would reverse on this ground.\r\nThe general rule is that the trial\r\njudge has discretion to order separate charges to be tried together over the\r\ndefendantâ€™s objection where the offenses charged â€œare of the same general\r\nnature, involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place and\r\ncharacter . . . .â€[8]&nbsp; State\r\nv. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 43, 282 S.E.2d 838, 843 (1981); cf., State\r\nv. Evans, 112 S.C. 43, 99 S.E. 751 (1919)(no abuse of discretion in trial\r\njudgeâ€™s denial of defendantsâ€™ motion to try two murder charges together).\r\nOnce a court determines that charges may properly be joined, it must then\r\nconsider whether it should decline to consolidate the claims in order to protect\r\nthe defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial. Id. (joinder is improper where the defendant can demonstrate\r\nthat his substantive rights would be violated by such a procedure); see also\r\nState v. Smith, 322 S.C. 107, 470 S.E.2d 364 (1996);&nbsp; State v.\r\nWilliams, 263 S.C. 290, 210 S.E.2d 298 (1974); McCray v. State, 249\r\nS.C. 14, 152 S.E.2d 235 (1967).&nbsp; As we have long recognized, â€œCircumstances\r\nmight arise which would render a uniting of several counts unjust to the\r\ndefendant.â€&nbsp; City of Greenville v. Chapman, 210 S.C. 157, 162, 41\r\nS.E.2d 865, 867 (1947).&nbsp; Even where joinder is permissible, the trial court\r\nmust be mindful of protecting the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial because\r\nâ€œ[b]y the multiplication of distinct charges, the prisoner may be confounded\r\nin his defense, or prejudiced in his challenges, or the attention of the jury\r\nmay be distracted.â€ Id. (internal citations omitted).\r\nIn this case, the first issue is\r\nwhether the trial judge abused his discretion in finding a relationship\r\nsufficient to permit the State to try appellant on three charges at a single\r\ntrial:&nbsp; the homicide of Parker Colson on January 4, 1993; the injury to\r\nAsher Maier discovered on June 23, 1993; and the homicide of Ashlan Daniel on\r\nSeptember 9, 1993.&nbsp; In my opinion, while these charges are of the same\r\ngeneral nature, they do not involve â€œconnected transactions closely related in\r\nkind, place and characterâ€ as these terms are defined by our case law.&nbsp;\r\nCrimes which do not arise out of a â€œsingle chain of circumstancesâ€ and which\r\nrequire â€œdifferent evidence for proofâ€ â€œclearly fail[] to meet the\r\nrequirements for consolidation.â€&nbsp; State v. Middleton, 288 S.C. 21,\r\n23, 339 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1986) (reversing where charges of rape and murder of\r\none victim, rape and murder of a second victim the next day, and attempted\r\nrobbery and assaults on the day after were consolidated for trial).&nbsp; I\r\nwould hold the trial judge committed reversible error in allowing these three\r\ncharges to be tried together over appellantâ€™s objection, as they did not arise\r\nout of a single chain of circumstances and required different proof.[9] Id.\r\nI would reverse appellantâ€™s\r\nconvictions and remand the matter for further proceedings.\r\n\r\n[1] MSBP was first identified by a pediatrician in 1997 and is a\r\nmedically recognized syndrome.\r\n[2]State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).\r\n[3] Appellant was retried in 1999; that trial ended in a mistrial when\r\nthe jury could not agree.&nbsp; This is appellantâ€™s third trial.\r\n[4]Here, the State produced evidence each offense involved the violent\r\nshaking of an infant at the Cutroâ€™s home daycare with the intent of promoting\r\nsympathy for the caregiver from the resulting injury to the child.&nbsp; These\r\noffenses are closely related in kind, place, and character as required to\r\nsupport joinder.\r\n[5]See also Rule 404(b), SCRE (codifying Lyle\r\ncategories).\r\n[6]Appellantâ€™s brief mentions the funeral bulletin for the Lightfoot\r\nchild, a baby who died of SIDS while in the care of another home daycare\r\nprovider known to appellant through her church.&nbsp; This evidence also\r\ndirectly related to the case at hand.&nbsp; The State sought to establish that\r\nappellant knew about the outpouring of sympathy for the other daycare worker and\r\nthis motivated her own behavior.&nbsp;\r\n[7] Dr. Sexton, who performed several of these autopsies, testified\r\nthat some showed microscopic brain vessel damage similar to that seen in Parker\r\nColson and Ashlan Daniel.&nbsp;\r\n[8] I disagree with the majority that the test for joinder is the same\r\nas the standard for admitting prior bad act evidence under State v.

Marsh, Op. No.\r\n2003-UP-662 (S.C. Ct. App. filed\r\nNovember 17, 2003).&nbsp; We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1991,\r\nMarsh and Walter Berg acquired a beach house, as co-tenants, for $110,000.&nbsp;\r\nDuring their ownership, the beach house was rented out during the summer season\r\nand occupied by Marsh for the remainder of the year.&nbsp; While living in the\r\nhouse, Marsh, a painter, created landscapes inspired by the surrounding Pawleys Island\r\narea.&nbsp; Despite attempts by Marsh to purchase Bergâ€™s interest in the\r\nproperty, the two remained co-tenants.\r\nIn 2002,\r\nthe Zimmermans purchased Bergâ€™s one-half interest in the beach house for\r\n$160,000.[1]&nbsp; Thereafter, the\r\ndeed and the instant partition action were filed minutes apart.&nbsp; Marsh\r\nresponded by requesting partition by allotment, a result that would allow her to\r\nretain the beach house and pay the Zimmermans for their interest.\r\nAt\r\ntrial, four appraisals were introduced in order to properly ascertain the value\r\nof the land.&nbsp; The Zimmermans introduced three appraisals of $320,000,\r\n$355,000, and $373,500.&nbsp; Marsh introduced one appraisal, which estimated\r\nthe value of the parcel from $315,700 to $329,000.&nbsp; Marsh also introduced\r\ntestimony to establish the duration of her ownership and the sentimental\r\nattachment she had for the property.&nbsp; At the conclusion of trial, the\r\nmaster ordered partition by public sale.\r\nThe\r\nmaster found that, due to the size, shape, and location of the property, a\r\npartition in kind was not possible.&nbsp; The master further found partition by\r\nallotment was not available due to the wide variance of the appraised values of\r\nthe property.&nbsp; The master cited Pruitt v. Pruitt, 298 S.C. 411, 380\r\nS.E.2d 862 (Ct. App. 1989), for the proposition that where two equally\r\ncreditable yet significantly disparate appraisals are introduced, a court should\r\nnot partition the property by allotment.&nbsp; The master noted Marshâ€™s length\r\nof ownership and her emotional attachment to the property did not require that\r\nshe be given priority over the Zimmermans.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err by\r\n  finding partition by allotment inapplicable?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMarsh argues the Court of Appeals\r\nerred by finding partition by allotment inapplicable.&nbsp; She argues the Court\r\nof Appeals should be reversed and this matter remanded to the trial court for\r\nthe purpose of allowing her to be allotted the property upon payment of the\r\nvalue of the Zimmermansâ€™ interest and for applying the appropriate set-off\r\ncredits.\r\nA\r\npartition action is an equitable action and, as such, we may review the evidence\r\nto determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence.&nbsp; Anderson v. Anderson,\r\n299 S.C. 110, 382 S.E.2d 897 (1989).\r\nThe partition procedure must be fair\r\nand equitable to all parties of the action.&nbsp; Pruitt v. Pruitt, supra.&nbsp;\r\nWhen the court determines a partition cannot be fairly and equally made, the\r\ncourt may order a sale of the property and a division of the proceeds according\r\nto the rights of the parties.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-100 (2005).&nbsp; See\r\nalso S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-50 (2005) (if partition in kind or by allotment\r\ncannot be fairly and impartially made and without injury to any of the parties\r\nin interest, then court of common pleas has jurisdiction to order sale of the\r\nproperty and the division of the proceeds according to the partiesâ€™ rights);\r\nRule 71(f)(4), SCRCP (â€œIf it shall appear to the court that it will be for the\r\nbenefit of all parties interested in the . . . property that it should be vested\r\nin one or more of the persons entitled to a portion of it, on the payment of a\r\nsum of money . . ., the court shall determine accordingly, and the person or\r\npersons, on the payment of the consideration money, shall be vested with the\r\n[property]. &nbsp;But if it shall appear to the court that it would be more for\r\nthe interest of the parties interested in the . . . property that it should be\r\nsold and the proceeds of sale be divided among them, then the court shall direct\r\na sale to be made upon such terms as the court shall deem right.â€).&nbsp;\r\nFurther, the party seeking a partition by sale carries the burden of proof to\r\nshow that partition by allotment is not practicable or expedient.&nbsp; See\r\nCox v. Frierson, 316 S.C. 469, 451 S.E.2d 392 (1994) (partition by\r\nallotment is statutorily preferred over judicial sale of the property).&nbsp; Cf.\r\nAnderson v. Anderson, supra (party seeking partition by sale\r\ncarries burden to show partition in kind is not practicable or\r\nexpedient).&nbsp; A partition by public sale, where there is disparate testimony\r\nas to the value of the property, will be required if equity necessitates such an\r\noutcome.&nbsp; See Pruitt v. Pruitt, supra (under\r\nparticular facts and circumstances of Pruitt case, equity required\r\njudicial sale).&nbsp;\r\nThe master erred by finding a\r\npartition by allotment cannot be fairly made.&nbsp; While there were conflicting\r\nappraisals as to the value of the property, the value of the property could have\r\nbeen determined by the master.&nbsp; By taking into consideration the fact the\r\nZimmermans paid Berg $160,000 for a one-half interest in the property and by\r\ntaking an average of all of the appraisals, a value of the property can be\r\nobtained.&nbsp; We find that the pecuniary interests of the parties will not be\r\ndamaged by averaging the appraisals.&nbsp; Further, we find it troublesome that\r\nthe Zimmermans purchased their interest with the knowledge that Marsh would be\r\nunwilling to sell the property and with the apparent intention to seek an\r\nimmediate partition of the property. &nbsp;Under the particular facts of this\r\ncase, we find that equity does not necessitate a partition by public sale and a\r\npartition by allotment is the most equitable result.[2] &nbsp;See Pruitt v. Pruitt, supra.\r\nWhile we find that equitable\r\nconsiderations such as the length of ownership and sentimental attachment to the\r\nproperty may be considered, the pecuniary interests of all of the parties is the\r\ndetermining factor in deciding whether to require a judicial sale or allow a\r\npartition by allotment.&nbsp; See, e.g., Ark Land Co. v. Harper,\r\n599 S.E.2d 754 (W.Va. 2004) (economic value of property is not the exclusive\r\ntest for deciding whether to partition in kind or by sale; evidence of\r\nlongstanding ownership, coupled with sentimental or emotional interests in the\r\nproperty, may also be considered in deciding whether the interests of the party\r\nopposing the sale will be prejudiced by the propertyâ€™s sale); Schnell v.\r\nSchnell, 346 N.W.2d 713 (N.D. 1984) (sentimental reasons, particularly in\r\npreservation of a home, may be considered, although they are subordinate to the\r\npartiesâ€™ pecuniary interests); Fike v. Sharer, 571 P.2d 1252 (Ore.\r\n1977) (same); Pioneer Mill Co., Ltd. v. Ward, 37 Haw. 74, 1945 WL 5584 (Hawaiâ€™i\r\nTerr. 1945) (same); Anderson v. Anderson, 108 S.E. 907 (Ga. App. 1921)\r\n(same).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nUnder the particular facts of this\r\ncase, we find the master erred by finding a judicial sale was appropriate.&nbsp;\r\nBecause a value could have been placed on the property at the time of trial,\r\nMarshâ€™s request for a partition by allotment should have been granted.&nbsp;\r\nWe remand to the master to set the value of the property, adjusted by\r\nappropriate set-off credits, so that Marsh may purchase the Zimmermansâ€™\r\none-half interest.&nbsp; Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\nTOAL, C.J., and WALLER, J.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT,\r\nJ., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; I\r\nrespectfully dissent.&nbsp; While the Zimmermansâ€™ conduct may properly be\r\ncharacterized as acquisitive, they have done nothing illegal.&nbsp;\r\nA joint tenant may compel\r\npartition.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-10 (2005).&nbsp; A court may order\r\npartition in kind, that is, divide the property among all the owners, or by\r\nallotment, that is, to â€œallotâ€ a portion of the property to one of the\r\nowners, with the remainder held jointly by the other owners or sold with the\r\nproceeds divided among the owners,[3]\r\nor by judicial sale of the entire parcel. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-50\r\n(2005).&nbsp; The circuit court may, in some limited circumstances not present\r\nhere, allot the property to one of the joint owners and require that individual\r\nto pay a sum assessed by partition commissioners to the other owner(s).&nbsp;\r\nRule 71(f), SCRCP[4]; Carnes v.\r\nWhite, 3 S.C.L.(1 Brev.) 458 (1889)(partition commissioners may make special\r\nreturn: upon payment of sum set by them title vests in payor).\r\nIn this case, there is no contention\r\nthat a partition in kind can be made, there being one house located on one\r\nlot.&nbsp; Further, the property is not capable of partition by allotment\r\nbetween the parties.&nbsp; The majority in effect orders a private rather\r\nthan a public sale:&nbsp; this is not a form of partition recognized in this\r\njurisdiction absent a special return by five commissioners acting upon a writ of\r\npartition.[5] Â§ 15-61-50;\r\ncompare Fike v. Sharer, 571 P.2d 1252 (Ore. 1977) (Oregon statute\r\npermits partition by private sale between the parties where neither partition in\r\nkind nor by public sale can be achieved without great prejudice to the owners).\r\nI am not averse to permitting\r\nconsideration of sentimental attachment in a partition suit, but I would limit\r\nits use as have other jurisdictions; sentimental value may tip the balance in\r\nfavor of a partition in kind rather than by public sale even where a sale would\r\ngenerate a somewhat more favorable financial outcome for the parties.&nbsp; See\r\nArk Land Co. v. Harper, 599 S.E.2d 754 (W.Va. 2004) (where commercial\r\nentity becomes co-owner with expectation it can make money off the land from its\r\nbusiness venture, court will not permit this self-created value enhancement to\r\nbe determinative factor in forcing sale; partition in kind ordered even though\r\nbusiness suffered some â€œeconomic inconvenienceâ€); Schnell v. Schnell,\r\n346 N.W.2d 713 (N.D. 1984)(partition in kind rather than sale ordered where\r\ndivorced parties were dividing a sizable ranch); Pioneer Mill Co., Ltd. v.\r\nWard, 37&nbsp; Haw. 74 (Hawaiâ€™i Terr. 1945) (partition in kind even though\r\ntopography made it difficult; sentimentality rule recited but not applied); Anderson\r\nv. Anderson, 108 S.E. 907 (Ga. App. 1921) (sentimentality weighs in favor of\r\nin kind partition but pecuniary factors are determinative in deciding between in\r\nkind partition and judicial sale).\r\nNo one contends that an in kind\r\ndistribution or allotment is feasible here, and thus we do not reach the issue\r\nof the weight to be given Ms. Marshâ€™s emotional ties to the property in\r\ndeciding the mode of partition to be employed.&nbsp; A public sale is the only\r\nmethod of partition available, and the Zimmermans are within their legal rights\r\nin demanding one be held. Â§ 15-61-10.&nbsp; I would not alter the law of\r\npartition to favor a joint owner perceived as more worthy, and therefore would\r\naffirm the decision of the Court of Appeals which itself affirmed the masterâ€™s\r\norder.&nbsp;\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs\r\n\r\n[1]The Zimmermans admit they made repeated inquiries into the\r\navailability of the house prior to their purchase and that they were aware Marsh\r\nwas not interested in selling the beach house.&nbsp; We note respondent Sarah\r\nZimmerman has been a real estate agent in the Pawleys Island\r\narea for several years.\r\n[2]Contrary to the dissentâ€™s assertion, a public sale is not the\r\nonly method of partition available in this case.&nbsp; Pursuant to Â§ 15-61-50\r\nand Rule 71(f)(4), the appropriate and applicable remedy is a partition by\r\nallotment whereby one joint owner is allotted the entire property.\r\nThe dissent further contends\r\npartition by allotment is not applicable because a writ of partition, which\r\ncommands nominated commissioners to partition the property, has not been\r\nissued.&nbsp; However, both Â§ 15-61-100 and Rule 71(f)(5) allow the master to\r\ndispense with the issuing of a writ of partition if it would involve unnecessary\r\nexpense.&nbsp; There is no statement in the rule or statutes which indicates\r\nthat a writ of partition and a return from the commissioners is required before\r\npartition by allotment to one party can occur. &nbsp;To hold otherwise would\r\nexpand the operation of the statutes and the rule.&nbsp; Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 468 S.E.2d 649 (1996) (in interpreting\r\nstatute, words must be given plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to\r\nsubtle or forced construction to limit or expand statuteâ€™s operation).\r\n[3] See, e.g., Few v. Few, 242 S.C. 433, 131 S.E.2d 208\r\n(1963); Bennett v. Floyd, 237 S.C. 64, 115 S.E.2d 659 (1960).\r\n[4] The majority characterizes its relief as a partition by allotment\r\npursuant to Rule 71(f)(4), SCRCP.&nbsp; I have reviewed the record and have\r\nfound neither a writ of partition nor a return from the commissioners.&nbsp;\r\nAbsent compliance with the requirements of this rule, a court may order only a\r\npartition in kind or a public sale.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-100(2005);\r\nRule 71(f)(5), SCRCP.\r\n[5] I note further that a party not allotted the property by the\r\ncommissioners may force a public sale by â€œmaking and securing a bid for a\r\nmaterial advance in price over the value assessed by the Commissioners.â€&nbsp; Moore\r\nv.

(Southco), fell\r\nasleep while operating a street sweeper on a nearby street.&nbsp; As a result,\r\nthe sweeper ran through a stop sign, jumped a curve, crossed a small grassy\r\narea, and collided with the trackâ€™s crossties.&nbsp; According to one of CSXâ€™s\r\nengineers, the impact of the sweeper knocked the track several inches out of\r\nalignment.&nbsp; The estimated speed of the sweeper at the time of the collision\r\nwas forty-seven miles per hour.&nbsp;\r\nMinutes after the collision, the\r\ntrain, with Peterson aboard, crossed the area where the sweeper hit the trackâ€™s\r\ncrossties.&nbsp; The train derailed.&nbsp; As a result Peterson was severely\r\ninjured.&nbsp; Four eyewitnesses testified in deposition that no one had time to\r\nwarn CSX or Amtrak before the train arrived.\r\nAppellants claim that Respondents\r\ndid not properly maintain the area of the track where the derailment\r\noccurred.&nbsp; Appellants further assert that, but for Respondentsâ€™\r\nnegligence, the sweeper would not have misaligned the track to such a degree\r\nthat the train would have derailed.&nbsp; In support of this argument,\r\nAppellants presented expert testimony that Respondents violated federal track\r\nsafety standards and their own internal policies.[2]&nbsp; The trial court granted summary judgment in\r\nfavor of Respondents.&nbsp; Appellants appealed.\r\nThe following issues have been\r\nraised on appeal:\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Did the trial court err in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary\r\n  judgment?\r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in ruling that Appellantsâ€™ claims were preempted\r\n    by federal law?\r\n    B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did Respondents violate federal law?\r\n    C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in striking the expert testimony?\r\n  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Did the trial court err in awarding costs to Respondents?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Summary Judgment\r\nAppellants argue that the trial\r\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Respondents.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.&nbsp;\r\nActions brought pursuant to FELA are\r\ngoverned by federal standards.&nbsp; Rogers\r\nv. Norfolk S. Corp., 356 S.C. 85, 91, 588 S.E.2d 87, 89 (2003).&nbsp; Under\r\nthe federal standard, a trial judge must view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; However, unlike the state standard, the federal\r\nstandard requires this Court to determine whether the evidence is of such a\r\nquality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded jurors, in the exercise of\r\nimpartial judgment, could return a verdict in favor of the non-moving\r\nparty.&nbsp; Id. at 92, 588\r\nS.E.2d at 90 (citing Crinkley v. Holiday Inns, 844 F.2d 156, 160 (4th\r\nCir. 1988)).&nbsp; To avoid summary judgment, the evidence must demonstrate that\r\nthe employerâ€™s negligence[3] â€œplayed\r\nany part, even in the slightest, in producing the injury . . . for which damages\r\nare sought.â€ Id. (citing Rogers v. Missouri\r\nPac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S.   500, 506 (1957)).&nbsp;\r\nA.&nbsp; Preemption\r\nAppellants argue that Respondentsâ€™\r\ndeviation from their own internal track maintenance policies is relevant to the\r\nissue of negligence. But Respondents argue that the policies are not admissible\r\nbecause they are preempted by federal law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with\r\nAppellants.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial judge ruled that the\r\nstandard of care is established by federal law[4] and granted summary judgment on the basis of, among other things,\r\npreemption.&nbsp; Based on this ruling, the trial court did not consider\r\nevidence of Respondentsâ€™ deviation from their own internal track maintenance\r\npolicies.&nbsp; We agree that the standard of care is established by federal\r\nlaw; however, we do not agree that this prevents the court from considering\r\nevidence that Respondents violated their own internal polices.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough federal regulations provide\r\nthe standard of care, Respondentsâ€™ deviation from their own internal policies\r\nis, nevertheless, admissible as evidence that Respondents deviated from that\r\nstandard of care. &nbsp;Cf. Ybarra v. Burlington N., Inc., 689 F.2d 147, 150 (8th Cir. 1982) (holding\r\nthat when the evidence shows that the railroad customarily does not enforce a\r\nsafety rule, the jury is entitled to consider whether that custom constituted\r\nnegligence and whether it caused, in whole or in part, the plaintiffâ€™s\r\ninjury).&nbsp; Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred when it held that\r\nAppellantsâ€™ claims were preempted by federal law.&nbsp; Further, we hold that\r\nevidence of Respondentsâ€™ deviation from their internal maintenance policies is\r\nadmissible to show the element of breach.&nbsp; See Rogers, 356 S.C. at\r\n91, 588 S.E.2d at 90 (FELA claims are evaluated as if they were common law\r\nnegligence claims, and therefore the plaintiff is responsible for demonstrating\r\neach element of negligence); See also Assoc. Mgmt., Inc. v. E. D. Sauls\r\nConstr. Co., 279 S.C. 219, 221, 305 S.E.2d 236, 237 (1983) (evidence that\r\ntends to establish or to make more or less probable some matter at issue and to\r\nbear directly or indirectly thereon is relevant and admissible).&nbsp;\r\nB.&nbsp; Violation of Federal\r\nLaw\r\nAppellants\r\nargue that Respondents violated federal law by not properly maintaining the\r\ntracks.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe Federal Railroad Administration\r\nregulations governing the maintenance of ballast provide:\r\n\r\n  Ballast; general\r\n  Unless it is otherwise\r\n  structurally supported, all track shall be supported by material which will-\r\n  (a) Transmit and distribute the\r\n  load of the track and railroad rolling equipment to the subgrade;\r\n  (b)Restrain the track laterally,\r\n  longitudinally, and vertically under dynamic loads imposed by railroad rolling\r\n  equipment and thermal stress exerted by the rails;\r\n  (c) Provide adequate drainage for\r\n  the track; and\r\n  (d)Maintain proper track\r\n  crosslevel, surface, and alinement.\r\n\r\n49 C.F.R. Â§ 213.103.\r\nWe find\r\nno evidence in the record that the ballasts at the site of the derailment were\r\ninadequate to â€œmaintain proper alignmentâ€ under normal conditions.&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, we do not interpret this provision to mean that the ballast must be\r\nmaintained in such a way so as to prevent misalignment in situations where the\r\ntrack is struck with great force.&nbsp; Therefore, we find that Respondents did\r\nnot violate the regulation.\r\nC.&nbsp; Expert Testimony\r\nAppellants presented affidavits and\r\ndeposition testimony of three experts who opined that, because the ballast\r\naround the derailment site had eroded, the track was susceptible to being\r\nknocked out of line.&nbsp; The trial court ruled that this evidence was\r\ninadmissible.&nbsp;&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; However, we hold that, although the\r\nevidence was admissible, the evidence did not sufficiently establish that\r\nRespondentsâ€™ acts or omissions caused or contributed to Appellantsâ€™\r\ninjuries.\r\n1.&nbsp; Admissibility\r\nThe admission of evidence is within\r\nthe sound discretion of the trial judge, and absent a clear abuse of discretion\r\namounting to an error of law, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed\r\non appeal.&nbsp; Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736,\r\n742 (1989).&nbsp; Evidence that tends to establish or to make more or less\r\nprobable some matter at issue and to bear directly or indirectly thereon is\r\nrelevant and admissible.&nbsp; Assoc. Mgmt., Inc. v. E. D. Sauls Constr. Co.,\r\n279 S.C. 219, 221, 305 S.E.2d 236, 237 (1983).&nbsp;\r\nIn general, courts allow experts to\r\ntestify if they are more qualified in the field than a juror on the\r\nsubject.&nbsp; Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp.,\r\n326 S.C. 248, 252-53, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997).&nbsp; An expert witness may\r\nstate an opinion based on facts not within his first-hand knowledge, and may\r\nbase his opinion on information, whether or not admissible, made available to\r\nhim before the hearing if the information is of the type reasonably relied upon\r\nin the field. Rule 703, SCRE; Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 64, 580\r\nS.E.2d 433, 436 (2003).&nbsp; Defects in an expert witnessâ€™ education and\r\nexperience go to the weight, not the admissibility, of the expertâ€™s\r\ntestimony.&nbsp; Gooding, 326 S.C. at 253, 487 S.E.2d at 598.\r\nIn the present case, Appellants\r\npresented the testimony of three experts.&nbsp; First, Donald Bowden (Bowden), a\r\nformer CSX Roadmaster,[5] opined that\r\nRespondents did not comply with CSXâ€™s internal maintenance policies.&nbsp; In\r\naddition, Bowden testified that federal regulations do not provide â€œdetailed\r\nspecifications for ballasts,â€ and â€œinsufficient or substandard ballast is\r\nnot always considered a direct violation of federal regulations.â€ But if\r\nRespondents had followed their own internal policies, he opined, â€œthe street\r\nsweeper would not have struck the end of the crossties.â€[6]\r\nAppellants also presented the\r\ntestimony of Ray Whitehurst (Whitehurst), a former CSX machinery\r\noperator.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his affidavit, Whitehurst stated that he frequently\r\noperated a backhoe around railroad tracks, and that if the track had been\r\nproperly ballasted, the track would have been able to â€œwithstand a lateral\r\nblow from heavy machinery . . . at moderate to slow speeds[7] without (the track) coming out of alignment.â€&nbsp;\r\nIn addition, Whitehurst opined that â€œ[h]ad there been proper ballast to CSX\r\nstandards, the tires of the street sweeper would have ridden up over the\r\ncrossties and impacted the rail, rather than the ends of the crossties.â€\r\nFinally, Appellants presented the\r\ntestimony of H. T. Paton, who is a railroad safety consultant and former\r\nrailroad engineer.&nbsp; He opined that if the ballast been properly maintained,\r\nthe sweeper would not have struck the crossties, causing the train to derail.\r\nAfter considering this evidence, the\r\ntrial court ruled that the expert testimony was inadmissible because it was\r\nspeculative and the experts were â€œnot qualified to render such opinions, nor\r\n[had] they conducted any testing, studies, calculations, or any analysis\r\nwhatsoever.â€&nbsp; We disagree and find that Appellantsâ€™ experts had the\r\nnecessary experience and facts to give an opinion as to whether Respondents were\r\nnegligent.&nbsp; The expertsâ€™ lack of first-hand knowledge, which could have\r\nbeen obtained by an on-site investigation, goes to the weight of the testimony,\r\nnot its admissibility.&nbsp; Therefore, the trial court erred in striking the\r\ntestimony.\r\n2.&nbsp; Sufficiency of\r\nEvidence\r\nAppellants argue that the expert\r\ntestimony presented shows that if the tracks had more ballast, the train would\r\nnot have derailed.&nbsp; &nbsp;We disagree.\r\nThe Appellants rely on expert\r\ntestimony to establish the element of causation. &nbsp;Appellantsâ€™ experts\r\nopined that if Respondents had put more ballast at the derailment site,[8] then the sweeper would have jumped\r\nthe crossties instead of colliding with them.&nbsp; The experts also opined that\r\nif the track had a six-inch ballast shoulder, [9] then the track would have misaligned to a lesser degree; however,\r\nthey have not provided how much less.\r\nNone of the experts were willing to\r\nsay that, had Respondents maintained the ballast in accordance with their own\r\ninternal policies, such an impact would not have affected the rail to a degree\r\nthat the train would have derailed.&nbsp; Moreover, none of the experts\r\ntestified as to the amount of force necessary to knock an identical track with a\r\nsix-inch ballast shoulder out of alignment.&nbsp; In fact, no testimony was\r\npresented that the track would maintain the necessary alignment had the sweeper\r\njumped the crossties and struck the rail.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, while evidence may\r\nexist that Respondents did not comply with their own internal safety policies,\r\nthere is no evidence that this noncompliance caused the train to derail.&nbsp;\r\nInstead, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that the cause of derailment was the\r\nimpact of the sweeper.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the expert\r\ntestimony, while admissible, fails to provide that failure to maintain the\r\nballast in accordance with Respondentsâ€™ own policies caused or contributed to\r\nthe trainâ€™s derailment.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Rogers, 356 S.C.\r\nat 90, 588 S.E.2d at 89 (to recover under a FELA, a plaintiff must prove the\r\ncommon law elements of negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages).&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment\r\nin favor of Respondents.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCosts\r\nAppellants\r\nargue that the trial court erred in awarding deposition costs.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nAn appellate court will not overturn\r\na trial courtâ€™s decision to award costs unless there has been an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.&nbsp; Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d\r\n901, 903 (1998).&nbsp; Costs may be imposed on the losing party when permitted\r\nby statute.&nbsp; Oliver v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp.,\r\n309 S.C. 313, 318, 422 S.E.2d 128, 131 (1992).&nbsp; A trial judge has broad\r\ndiscretion to award costs to the prevailing party.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n15-37-10 and 15-37-20 (1976).&nbsp; Once a trial judge awards costs to the\r\nprevailing party the clerk shall insert in the judgment costs of â€œthe fees of\r\nwitnessesâ€ and â€œthe reasonable compensation of commissioners in taking\r\ndepositions.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-37-40 (1976).&nbsp; In addition, the Rules\r\nof Civil Procedure recognize that the prevailing party shall be allowed costs\r\nper a trial courtâ€™s ruling.&nbsp; Rule 54(d), SCRCP.\r\nBecause summary judgment was proper,\r\nwe hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding\r\nRespondentsâ€™ costs.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm\r\nin result, holding that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment\r\nin favor of Respondents because Appellants have failed to establish sufficient\r\nevidence that Respondents caused or contributed to Appellantsâ€™ injuries.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1] 45 U.S.C.

Rogers, 356 S.C. at 91,\r\n588 S.E.2d at 90.&nbsp;\r\n[4] The Federal Railroad Administration, an agency under the\r\nDepartment of Transportation, promulgated regulations that provide for proper\r\nmaintenance of railroad tracks.&nbsp; The relevant regulations are found under\r\n49 C.F.R.

Anderson v. Augusta Chronicle, 355 S.C.\r\n461, 585 S.E.2d 506 (Ct.App. 2003).&nbsp; This Court granted the Chronicleâ€™s\r\npetition for certiorari to review that decision.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn\r\nNovember 1996, Respondent Tom Anderson (Anderson) lost an election for a seat in\r\nSouth Carolina House District 84.&nbsp; The following November, District 84 had\r\na special election, and Anderson\r\ndecided to run once again.[2]&nbsp;\r\nIn April\r\n1997, Chad Bray (Bray), a reporter for the Chronicle, called Anderson to interview him about the prior yearâ€™s campaign and\r\nelection.&nbsp; The parties dispute what exactly Anderson\r\nsaid during that interview.&nbsp; Anderson testified that he told Bray that during his 1996 campaign he\r\nhad worked in North Carolina as an\r\nappraiser for a number of insurance companies after hurricanes Fran and\r\nBertha.&nbsp; Anderson also testified that he told Bray\r\nthat, while in North Carolina, he\r\nworked for the National Flood Insurance Program.&nbsp; But according to Bray, Anderson said he was called away to the National Guard, not\r\nthe National Flood Insurance Program.&nbsp;\r\nOn April\r\n6, 1997, just days after Bray interviewed Anderson, the\r\nChronicle published an article about Anderson\r\nbeing called to serve in the National Guard during the 1996 campaign.&nbsp; On\r\nJune 3, 1997, the Chronicle published a second article in which Bray wrote that Anderson\r\nâ€œfelt cheated for being called away to the National Guardâ€ in the middle of\r\nhis campaign.&nbsp; Anderson testified that he was not aware that the Chronicle had\r\nprinted the two articles, and had he known, he would have contacted someone at\r\nthe Chronicle to notify them that they had made a mistake.&nbsp; Anderson first learned of the articles when he received a call from\r\nanother writer for the Chronicle, John Boyette (Boyette).\r\nBoyette\r\ncalled Anderson in September 1997 to ask whether Anderson\r\nwas going to withdraw from the race because â€œit had been proven that he had\r\nnot served in the National Guard.â€&nbsp; Anderson denied ever saying that he was in the\r\nNational Guard.&nbsp; After the interview, Boyette authored and the Chronicle\r\npublished an article entitled, â€œGOP wants Anderson Out of House Race.â€[3]\r\nIn\r\nresponse, Anderson sent Pat Willis, an employee of the Chronicle, a number of\r\ndocuments[4] revealing that he had\r\nworked as an appraiser, not in the National Guard.&nbsp; The documents, however,\r\ndid not confirm whether Anderson\r\nactually told Bray that he worked as an appraiser rather than serving in\r\nNational Guard.\r\nOn\r\nOctober 1, 1997, five days after Anderson sent the documentation of his\r\nappraisal work and a month before the special election, the Chronicle published\r\nthe following editorial entitled, â€œLet the Liar Runâ€ by Phil Kent (Kent):\r\n\r\n  Clearwater Democrat Tom\r\n  Anderson, running in Novemberâ€™s court-ordered special election for South\r\n  Carolinaâ€™s House District 84 seat, has been exposed as a liar.\r\n  He told this newspaper he was\r\n  called away to National Guard duty in the last weeks of the 1996 election, his\r\n  first race against incumbent state Rep. Roland Smith, R-Langley. (Anderson\r\n  lost by a decisive margin.)\r\n  It turns out, however, the\r\n  state Guard has no record of Anderson ever serving - either then or any\r\n  other time.\r\n  State\r\n  GOP director Trey Walker, saying Anderson\r\n  has dishonored himself and the National Guard, demands that the Democrat\r\n  withdraw from the race.&nbsp; Walkerâ€™s right about the dishonor, but what about the withdrawal?\r\n  If Anderson\r\n  is the best the Democrats can come up with, they still have every right to run\r\n  him.&nbsp; Thereâ€™s nothing in the election rules that says a political party\r\n  canâ€™t nominate for public office a candidate who, in effect, lies on his\r\n  resume.\r\n  We are confident that an\r\n  informed electorate wonâ€™t vote into office a proven prevaricator.&nbsp;\r\n  After all, he doesnâ€™t even have the long robes of one of Al Goreâ€™s\r\n  Buddhist monks to hide behind!\r\n\r\nAfter Anderson\r\nread the editorial, he called Kent \r\n to request that it be retracted.&nbsp; Kent    would not take Andersonâ€™s\r\ncall, but he told his assistant to tell Anderson\r\nthat if he sent the Chronicle a letter, it would be printed.&nbsp; Accordingly, Anderson\r\nwrote a letter to the editor, and it was printed the next day, under the heading\r\nâ€œCalls editorial â€˜sensationalâ€™ accusationsâ€; however, much of the letter\r\nwas edited to exclude parts where Anderson\r\ncriticized the editors.\r\nAnderson brought the underlying action against the Chronicle for\r\ndefamation.&nbsp; Anderson testified that, as a result of the\r\ndamaging editorial, he cannot concentrate, has suffered depression, and has\r\nmissed out on business opportunities, including an opportunity to head an\r\ninsurance claims branch office in Aiken.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial\r\njudge ruled that Anderson failed to show that the editor responsible for publishing the\r\narticle (Kent)\r\nknew that information in the article was false and, therefore, there was no\r\nissue of fact as to whether the editor acted with â€œactual malice.â€&nbsp; The\r\ncourt of appeals reversed, holding that the record included circumstantial\r\nevidence creating a question of fact as to whether Kent \r\n acted with â€œactual malice.â€&nbsp;\r\nThis\r\nCourt granted certiorari on the following issue:\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n  court of appeals err in reversing the trial courtâ€™s order directing a\r\n  verdict in favor of the Chronicle?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n&nbsp;Standard\r\nof Review\r\nWhen\r\nreviewing an order granting a directed verdict, this Court must view the facts\r\nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Elam v. South Carolina\r\nDepâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27-28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004) (citing\r\nStrange v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub Transp., 314 S.C.\r\n427, 445 S.E.2d 439 (1994)).\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe\r\nChronicle argues that the court of appeals erred in reversing the directed\r\nverdict because there is no evidence that the article was published with actual\r\nmalice.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nIn\r\naddition to the common law elements of defamation, a public official has the\r\nconstitutional burden of proving that the defendant published the alleged\r\ndefamatory material with â€œactual malice.â€&nbsp; New York Times v.\r\nSullivan. 376 U.S. \r\n 254, 269 (1964).&nbsp; To prove â€œactual malice,â€ the plaintiff must provide\r\nevidence that the defendant published the defamatory material (1) with the\r\nknowledge it was false or (2) with reckless disregard as to whether it was\r\nfalse. [5] &nbsp;Id. at 279-280; George v. Fabri,\r\n345 S.C. 440, 451, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).\r\nTo find\r\nâ€œactual malice,â€ the court must use a subjective standard to test the â€œpublisherâ€™s\r\ngood faith belief of the truth of his or her statements.â€&nbsp; Peeler v.\r\nSpartan Radiocasting, Inc., 324 S.C. 261, 266, 478 S.E.2d 282, 284\r\n(1997).&nbsp; In addition, the plaintiff must provide evidence the defendant had\r\na â€œhigh degree of awareness of . . . probable falsity.â€ Elder v. Gaffney\r\nLedger, 341 S.C. 108, 114, 533 S.E.2d 899, 902 (2000) (citing Garrison v.\r\nLouisiana, 379 U.S.    64, 74\r\n(1964)).&nbsp; In addition, one may recklessly disregard the falsity of alleged\r\ndefamatory material by failing to investigate the truth of the material when â€œthere\r\nare obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant.â€ Id.\r\n(citing St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. \r\n 727, 731 (1968)).\r\nAnderson does not dispute that he is a public official.&nbsp; The\r\nparties focus their arguments on whether the Chronicle published the article\r\nwith â€œactual malice.â€&nbsp; Accordingly, our discussion focuses on the\r\nelement of â€œactual maliceâ€ alone.\r\nReckless\r\nDisregard of the Truth\r\n&nbsp;The\r\ncentral issue of this case is whether any evidence exists tending to prove that Kent    recklessly disregarded the truth when he\r\npublished the article â€œLet the Liar Run.â€&nbsp; If such evidence exists, the\r\nquestion of actual malice is a question of fact for a jury.&nbsp; We find that\r\nthe record includes sufficient circumstantial evidence that Kent \r\n recklessly disregarded the truth when he published the article to place the\r\nquestion of actual malice before the jury.\r\nThe U. S.\r\nSupreme Court has recognized that failure to investigate, alone, is insufficient\r\nto support a finding that a defendant â€œrecklessly disregardedâ€ the falsity\r\nof a published article.&nbsp; See New York Times, 376 U.S. \r\n at 286-288 (holding that the actual malice standard cannot be met simply by\r\nusing an objective standard to find failure to investigate). &nbsp;South\r\nCarolina has also declined to impose rigid investigatory duties on members of\r\nthe press.&nbsp; This Court has held that to â€œestablish recklessness, there\r\nmust be an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting\r\nordinarily adhered to by reasonable publishers.â€ Peeler, 324 S.C. at\r\n266, 478 S.E.2d at 285.&nbsp; Further, this Court held that the â€œreckless\r\nconduct contemplated by the New York Times standard is not measured by\r\nwhether a reasonably prudent man would have . . . investigated before\r\npublishing.â€ George, 345 S.C. at 456, 548 S.E.2d at 876 (internal\r\ncitations and quotations omitted).&nbsp;\r\nNevertheless, the Supreme Court has\r\nrecognized that a plaintiff will rarely find success in proving awareness that a\r\nstatement is false â€œfrom the mouth of a defendant himself.â€&nbsp; Herbert\r\nv. Lando, 441 U.S.    153, 171-72, 99 S.Ct.1635, 60 L.Ed.2d\r\n115 (1979).&nbsp; Therefore, any direct or indirect evidence relevant to the\r\ndefendantâ€™s state of mind is admissible to prove actual malice.&nbsp; A\r\nplaintiff may present competent circumstantial evidence of bad faith to\r\nestablish actual malice despite a defendantâ€™s contention that the publication\r\nwas made â€œwith a belief the statements were true.â€&nbsp; St. Amant v.\r\nThompson, 390 U.S.    727, 732, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262\r\n(1968).&nbsp; Furthermore, a subjective awareness of probable falsity can be\r\nshown if there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the\r\naccuracy of his reports.&nbsp; Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v.\r\nConnaughton, 491 U.S. \r\n 657, 688, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 105 L.Ed.2d 562 (1989).\r\nThe record in this case is replete\r\nwith circumstantial evidence of bad faith on the part of Kent.&nbsp;\r\nThe record also contains reasons to doubt the accuracy of Brayâ€™s recount of\r\nthe interview with Anderson.&nbsp; First, Anderson testified he told\r\nJohn Boyette he had been in North\r\nCarolina working for various insurance companies, including National\r\nFlood.&nbsp; Boyetteâ€™s September 18 article confirms both Andersonâ€™s denial and his contention that he had spent two months\r\nworking in North Carolina for National\r\nFlood.&nbsp; Anderson contacted The Chronicle to dispute Boyetteâ€™s\r\narticle and was led to believe the misunderstanding would be corrected. &nbsp;\r\nSecond, on September 26 Anderson\r\nreceived a call from Pat Willis, an employee of The Chronicle.&nbsp; Anderson\r\ntestified Willis specifically requested proof that he was a federally-approved\r\ninsurance adjuster and that he had worked in North Carolina.&nbsp; Anderson\r\nfaxed to Willis, among other things, a letter from the supervisor of National\r\nFloodâ€™s claims field operations and a resume he prepared and used during his\r\ncampaign for House Seat 84.&nbsp; The information contained in Andersonâ€™s\r\nresume directly contradicted Brayâ€™s initial reports in The Chronicle.&nbsp;\r\nAs recited by the Court of Appeals in its opinion, the resume noted Anderson had\r\nbeen 1) commended for supervising flood restoration projects in four states; 2)\r\nresponsible for â€œapproximately 200 contractors, workmen and damage assessors\r\nin efforts to house 4500 flood inundated families;â€ 3) a program chief in\r\nJohnstown, Pennsylvania following a destructive flood; 4) a contract coordinator\r\nin Los Angeles after mudslides in 1979; 5) a work supervisor following flooding\r\nin Winslow, Arizona; and 6) an appraiser of â€œproperty damage for various\r\ninsurance companies and government agencies following hurricanes Andrew, Hugo,\r\nAlicia, Freddie, Camille, [and] Betsy . . . .â€\r\nOf particular interest is the fact\r\nthat Andersonâ€™s resume specifically\r\nreferred to his military service in the Korean War, but made no mention of the\r\nNational Guard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Military records are public and easily\r\nverifiable.&nbsp; A jury could have concluded The Chronicle should have\r\nrealized Andersonâ€™s purported\r\nstatement was highly questionable, particularly in light of his advanced age.[6]&nbsp; These facts, known to The\r\nChronicle before publication of â€œLet the liar run,â€ could lead a\r\nreasonable jury to infer The Chronicle had â€œobvious reasons to doubtâ€\r\nBrayâ€™s recollection of his conversation with Anderson.\r\nFinally, Anderson\r\nentered into evidence an editorial published in the Aiken Standard on\r\nSeptember 21, 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior Writer Carl Langley wrote:\r\n\r\n  A year ago, and shortly before the\r\n  November elections, Anderson, a semi-retired insurance claims adjuster, was\r\n  asked by a group of independent insurance companies to help process claims\r\n  from hurricane damage in North Carolina.&nbsp; A large number of the claims\r\n  were made under the National Flood Insurance Program, which Anderson referred to in his conversations with me and which he told\r\n  me he gave to another reporter.(He not only furnished that information last\r\n  year, but again this past June after I asked him why he did not campaign\r\n  before the 1996 election).\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nAnderson also introduced into\r\nevidence a clip from the Aiken Standard published on September 27, 1996\r\nheadlined â€œCandidate leaves area to help Fran victims.â€&nbsp; The article\r\nstated that Anderson had to break off his campaign to help\r\nprocess insurance claims resulting from Hurricane Franâ€™s destruction in North\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; Based on this evidence, a jury could reasonably infer that Anderson had in fact said he was working with\r\nNational Flood, not that he was serving in the National Guard.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that\r\ncircumstantial evidence exists as to whether Kent    recklessly\r\ndisregarded the truth, and therefore acted with actual malice, when he published\r\nthe article â€œLet the Liar Run.â€\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the\r\nforegoing reasons, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision holding that the\r\nevidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Anderson,\r\nis sufficient to submit the question of actual malice to a jury.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting\r\nJustice Marion D. Myers, concur.&nbsp; BURNETT, J., concurring in a separate\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:&nbsp; I\r\nconcur in the majorityâ€™s opinion and result; however, I write separately to\r\naddress the serious questions this case raises about the responsibilities of\r\njournalists to the public and their audiences.&nbsp;\r\nWere we to hold the egregious facts\r\nof this case are insufficient to support a reasonable jury finding that Anderson\r\nhas shown actual malice, we would essentially foreclose all liability for\r\ndefamers against public officials.&nbsp;\r\nThe Chronicle discounts the evidence\r\nin arguing a failure to investigate alone, is insufficient for a finding that a\r\ndefendant â€œrecklessly disregardedâ€ the falsity of a published article.&nbsp;\r\nThe Chronicle ignores a line of Supreme Court jurisprudence guiding state and\r\nlower federal courts in determining what evidence is relevant to a finding of\r\nactual malice.&nbsp; The Supreme Court has concluded that, although a failure to\r\ninvestigate will not alone support a finding of actual malice, the purposeful\r\navoidance of the truth is in an entirely different category.&nbsp; See New\r\nYork Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.E.2d 686\r\n(1964).&nbsp; A reasonable jury could certainly infer that Andersonâ€™s claims\r\nof inaccuracy coupled with the circumstantial evidence outlined in the majority\r\nopinion evinces purposeful avoidance of the truth.&nbsp; See Harte-Hanks,\r\n491 U.S. at 692-93, 109 S.Ct. at 2698, 105 L.E.2d at 562.&nbsp; To hold that a\r\nreasonable jury could find evidence of actual malice in this case would not\r\nimpose, as the Chronicle suggests, a duty on a member of the press to avoid a\r\ncolleagueâ€™s word while investigating a story.&nbsp; To the contrary, allowing\r\na jury to determine whether actual malice has been shown in the face of the\r\nconsiderable circumstantial evidence in this case, strikes a balance between\r\nprotecting an individualâ€™s reputation and the First Amendmentâ€™s protection\r\nof free speech.\r\nThe right of a free press is not\r\nabsolute in a society that demands social responsibility and personal\r\nintegrity.&nbsp; Freedom itself is conditional upon the recognition of a higher\r\nsocial duty to pursue truth and justice.&nbsp; A publication that systematically\r\npanders to sensationalism and degradation at the expense of the truth presents a\r\ncost too high for a free society to tolerate.&nbsp;\r\nI believe freedom of the press is\r\none of the greatest safeguards of liberty.&nbsp; This safeguard is grounded in\r\ndemocratic ideals promoting free thought and vigorous debate.&nbsp; When\r\ndeliberate deception is elevated to perceived truth, the very values a free\r\npress seeks to preserve are compromised.&nbsp; In the interests of justice, we\r\nwill not allow a publication to go so unchecked as to promote the tyrannical\r\nimposition of false and misleading informationâ€”the very concern our\r\nforefathers sought to eliminate in demanding the press be free.&nbsp; Our\r\nliberty cannot be guarded but by a free and independent press.&nbsp; A reckless\r\nand deceptive media poses the greatest danger to this freedom we so\r\ncherish.&nbsp;\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I agree\r\nthe evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Anderson, is sufficient to\r\nsubmit the question of actual malice to the jury.\r\n\r\n[1] Morris Communications, the codefendant, does business as The\r\nAugusta Chronicle.\r\n[2] The special election was ordered as a result of redistricting.\r\n[3] On that same day, The Aiken Standard, a rival local\r\nnewspaper, published an article entitled â€œDemocrat responds to misinformation,â€\r\nwhich called the Chronicleâ€™s stories about Anderson\r\ninto question.&nbsp; Later, The Aiken Standard published an editorial\r\nentitled â€œSlithering outside the Reaches of the Facts,â€ which accused the\r\nChronicle of conspiring with the Republican Party to help defeat Anderson\r\nin the special election.\r\n[4] The documents included Andersonâ€™s work\r\ncertification, phone bills, hotel invoices, bank records, and checks he had\r\nwritten during the time he did appraisals in North Carolina.&nbsp;\r\n[5] This test has been supported by virtue of the doctrine of stare\r\ndecisis in several cases following Sullivan:&nbsp; Gertz, 418\r\nU.S. at 325; Butts, 388 U.S. at 130; Harte-Hanks Comm., 491 U.S.\r\nat 666; Fleming v.

(Old Republic).&nbsp; Old Republic\r\nremoved the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.\r\nThe underlying complaint alleges\r\nDecedent was involved in an automobile wreck while driving a semi-truck\r\nbelonging to his employer, Penske Truck Leasing Co. (Penske).&nbsp; The driver\r\nand passenger in the other vehicle were at fault in causing the wreck.&nbsp;\r\nDecedent died as a result of injuries sustained in the wreck.&nbsp; The alleged\r\nat-fault driver and passenger had minimum liability coverage of $15,000, which\r\nhas been tendered to Plaintiff in return for a covenant not to execute.\r\nPlaintiff alleges Old Republic failed\r\nto make a required meaningful offer of optional underinsured motorist (UIM)\r\ncoverage to the named insured, Penske.&nbsp; Plaintiff seeks to have the\r\nautomobile insurance policy sold by Old Republic\r\nreformed to include UIM coverage up to the liability limit contained in the\r\npolicy.\r\nThe insurance policy in question was\r\na three-year policy, renewable on an annual basis, covering the period of\r\nJanuary 1, 2000, to January 1, 2003.&nbsp; The wreck occurred January 23, 2002,\r\nwithin the policyâ€™s effective dates.&nbsp; The policy contains a deductible\r\nequal to the coverage limits contained in the policy.&nbsp; This type of policy\r\nis referred to in the insurance industry as a â€œfronting policy.â€\r\nThe total combined premium paid by\r\nPenske for the policy exceeded $50,000 a year.&nbsp; The policy provided\r\ncoverage in all fifty states.&nbsp; Before commencing this action, Old Republic\r\ndid not seek or obtain approval from the South Carolina Department of Insurance\r\n(Department) to sell the policy as an â€œexempt commercial policyâ€ as that\r\nterm is defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-1-20(40) (2002).\r\nFrom 1998 to 2001, Old Republic\r\npresented certain forms purporting to make a meaningful offer of optional UIM\r\ncoverage to Penske.&nbsp; Penske annually rejected UIM coverage, stating, e.g.,\r\nin a letter to Old Republic\r\nthat â€œour company philosophy is to purchase the minimum\r\nlimits for uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage only where required by\r\nstatute and reject this extra coverage when permitted by a stateâ€ (emphasis in\r\noriginal).\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp; Is the Old Republic/Penske\r\n  policy at issue an â€œexempt commercial policyâ€ as that term is defined in\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-1-20(40)?\r\n  2.&nbsp; Assuming the answer to #1\r\n  is â€œyes,â€ are automobile insurers in South Carolina required to make a\r\n  meaningful offer of optional UIM coverage when selling an â€œexempt commercial\r\n  policyâ€ as that term is defined in Section 38-1-20(40)?\r\n  3.&nbsp; Are automobile insurers\r\n  in South Carolina required to make a\r\n  meaningful offer of optional UIM coverage when selling a â€œfronting policyâ€\r\n  in which the insuredâ€™s deductible limits equal the liability limits?\r\n  4.&nbsp; In a commercial â€œfronting\r\n  policy,â€ is an insurer required to comply with the requirements of State\r\n  Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555\r\n  (1987), in order to make a meaningful offer of optional UIM coverage, when the\r\n  insured has expressed a desire not to purchase UIM coverage?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn answering a certified question\r\nraising a novel question of law, the Court is free to decide the question based\r\non its assessment of which answer and reasoning would best comport with the law\r\nand public policies of this state and the Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and\r\nright.&nbsp; See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C.\r\n406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9,\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004), and S.C.

Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 38-1-20(40) because Old Republic\r\nnever sought or obtained Departmentâ€™s approval before selling such a\r\npolicy.&nbsp; Old Republic\r\ncontends the policy is an exempt commercial policy under the definition in\r\neffect at the time of Decedentâ€™s death in January 2002.&nbsp;\r\nThe Legislature, defining the term\r\nfor the first time, provided in 2000 that\r\n\r\n  â€œ[e]xempt commercial policiesâ€\r\n  means policies for large commercial insureds where the total combined premiums\r\n  to be paid for these policies for one insured is greater than $50,000 annually\r\n  and as may be further provided for in regulation or in bulletins issued by the\r\n  director.&nbsp; Exempt commercial policies include all property and casualty\r\n  coverages except for commercial property and insurance related to credit\r\n  transactions written through financial institutions.\r\n\r\nAct No. 235 Â§ 1, 2000 S.C. Acts\r\n1680 (effective March 7, 2000, and codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-1-20(40)\r\n(2002)).&nbsp; This provision was in effect at the time of the fatal wreck.[1]\r\nAct No. 235 further provided\r\n\r\n  [i]t is unlawful for an insurer\r\n  doing business in this State to issue or sell in this state any exempt\r\n  commercial policy, contract or certificate until it has been filed with and\r\n  approved by the director or his designee.&nbsp; A filing that is filed with\r\n  the department is deemed to have met the requirements of this chapter unless\r\n  it (1) does not meet the requirements of law, (2) contains any provisions\r\n  which are unfair, deceptive, ambiguous, misleading, or unfairly\r\n  discriminatory, or (3) is going to be solicited by means of advertising,\r\n  communication, or dissemination of information which is deceptive or\r\n  misleading.&nbsp; If a filing is not in compliance with this chapter, the\r\n  director or his designee shall issue an order specifying in detail the\r\n  provisions with which the insurer has not complied and stating the time within\r\n  which the insurer has to comply with the order before the filing is no longer\r\n  valid.&nbsp; An order issued by the director pursuant to this section must be\r\n  on a prospective basis only and may not affect a contract issued or made\r\n  before the effective date of the order.\r\n\r\nAct No. 235 Â§ 4, 2000 Acts 1681\r\n(codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-61-25 (2002)).&nbsp; Under this provision, it\r\nis apparent the Legislature intended to allow issuers of exempt commercial\r\npolicies to file a policy form with&nbsp; Department, and it would be deemed\r\napproved unless Department subsequently issued an order to the contrary.&nbsp; See\r\nalso Act No. 235 Â§ 3, 2000 Acts 1680 (providing that insurers which issue\r\nexempt commercial policies are not required to obtain approval from Department\r\nbefore selling them) (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-61-20(A) (Supp. 2004)).\r\nThe Legislature further provided\r\nthat sellers of exempt commercial policies are not required to file rate\r\nschedules and plans with Department.&nbsp; Act No. 235 Â§Â§ 6-7, 2000 Acts\r\n1682-83 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 38-73-340 and -520 (Supp. 2004));[2] see also Act No. 235 Â§ 8,\r\n2000 Acts 1683 (providing that statute requiring notice of hearings on rate\r\nincreases does not apply to exempt commercial policies, which â€œare not subject\r\nto prior approvalâ€ by Department) (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-910(G)\r\n(2002)).\r\nDepartment has promulgated\r\nregulations which for the most part track the language of the previously cited\r\nstatutes.&nbsp; The regulations provide that â€œ[n]o insurer of exempt\r\ncommercial policies will be required to file any classification, rate, rule, or\r\nrating plan, or modifications thereof, for any exempt commercial insurance line\r\nprior to its use in this state.â€&nbsp; An insurer issuing an exempt commercial\r\npolicy must file the policy form with Department and must maintain a desk file\r\nof such forms for examination by Department upon request.&nbsp; Department,\r\nafter reviewing such a policy form, may disapprove the form for continued use on\r\na prospective basis.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 69-64 (Supp. 2004) (effective\r\nJune 27, 2003).\r\nLastly, the Legislature amended a\r\nprovision contained in Chapter 73 of Title 38, which deals with the filing and\r\napproval of certain insurance rates.&nbsp; The Legislature added a subsection in\r\nthe â€œDeclaration of Purposeâ€ provisions to state that a purpose of the\r\nchapter is to â€œprovide for reasonable competition for commercial property and\r\ncasualty insurers of insureds who make large purchases of insurance.â€&nbsp;\r\nAct No. 235 Â§ 5, 2000 Acts 1681 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-10(a)(4)\r\n(2002)); see also Act No. 181 Â§ 783, 1993 Acts 2079 (setting forth\r\nprevious version of Â§ 38-73-10(a)).\r\nBased on the above provisions and\r\nfocusing primarily on Act No. 235 which took effect in 2000, we answer Question\r\n1 â€œyes,â€ the policy at issue is an â€œexempt commercial policyâ€ pursuant\r\nto S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-1-20(40) (2002).&nbsp; The combined premium for the\r\npolicy at issue exceeded $50,000 annually and the policy provided casualty\r\ncoverage.\r\nOld Republicâ€™s\r\nfailure to seek or obtain Departmentâ€™s approval of the policy before selling\r\nit does not change the nature of the policy.&nbsp; Old Republic was required to file the policy form with Department, but\r\nwas not required to obtain Departmentâ€™s approval before selling such\r\npolicies.&nbsp; Department may impose an administrative fine on Old Republic\r\nfor failing to follow the filing requirements.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 38-2-10 (2002).\r\n2.&nbsp; REQUIREMENT OF\r\nMEANINGFUL OFFER IN SALE OF EXEMPT COMMERCIAL POLICY\r\nPlaintiff contends that, even if the\r\npolicy at issue is an exempt commercial policy, Old Republic\r\nis required to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage because the Legislature\r\nhas not exempted such policies from this requirement.&nbsp; Old Republic argues\r\nthe Legislatureâ€™s â€œcreation of a special category of â€˜exempt commercial\r\npoliciesâ€™ indicates a belief that large commercial accounts do not need the\r\nsame close regulation and court supervision as unsophisticated purchasers of\r\ninsurance do.â€&nbsp; Thus, it was not required to offer UIM coverage to Penske.&nbsp;\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory\r\ninterpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the\r\nLegislature.&nbsp; Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581\r\n(2000); Mid-State Automotive Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324\r\nS.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).&nbsp; In ascertaining the intent of the\r\nLegislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but\r\nshould consider the language of the statute as a whole.&nbsp; Mid-State,\r\n324 S.C. at 69, 476 S.E.2d at 692.&nbsp; When a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and\r\nunambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a\r\ncourt must apply the statute according to its literal meaning.&nbsp; Carolina\r\nPower &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville,\r\n314 S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994).\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002)\r\nprovides â€œ[automobile insurance] carriers shall also offer, at the option of\r\nthe insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured\r\nliability coverage to provide coverage in the event that damages are sustained\r\nin excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault insured or underinsured\r\nmotorist or in excess of any damages cap or limitation imposed by statute.â€\r\nAn automobile insurance carrier in South Carolina is required to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage\r\nwhen selling an exempt commercial policy to a commercial insured.&nbsp; Old Republic indisputably is an automobile\r\ninsurance carrier and, as such, was required to make a meaningful offer of UIM\r\ncoverage to Penske.\r\nNo statutory provision exempts\r\ninsurers which sell exempt commercial policies from the requirement of making a\r\nmeaningful offer of UIM coverage to a commercial insured as mandated by Section\r\n38-77-160.&nbsp; The only statutes addressing exempt commercial policies are\r\nthose discussed in Question 1. &nbsp;A review of those statutes reveals the\r\nLegislature modified Departmentâ€™s oversight of exempt commercial policies by\r\nestablishing a system in which approval of such policies is granted upon filing,\r\nsubject to later review and order by Department.&nbsp; The Legislature also\r\nexempted such policies from the usual rate-making and approval processes.&nbsp;\r\nThese changes were intended to promote reasonable competition among commercial\r\ninsurers, as explicitly stated by the Legislature.&nbsp; See Section\r\n38-73-10(a)(4).\r\nHowever, the Legislature did not\r\nsimilarly exempt insurers which sell such policies from complying with the usual\r\nrequirements of offering UIM coverage to their commercial insureds.&nbsp; Old Republicâ€™s\r\nargument is based on sheer speculation about the Legislatureâ€™s\r\nintentions.&nbsp; The Legislature could have created such an exemption in Act\r\nNo. 235 in 2000 when it defined exempt commercial policies and exempted them\r\nfrom certain other requirements; however, it did not do so.\r\nMoreover, the Legislatureâ€™s\r\namendment in 2002 and 2003 of three statutes addressing exempt commercial\r\npolicies supports our&nbsp; conclusion.&nbsp; In redefining â€œexempt commercial\r\npoliciesâ€ in Section 38-1-20(40), the Legislature in 2002 and 2003 changed the\r\nphrase â€œlarge commercial insuredsâ€ to â€œcommercial insureds.â€&nbsp; The\r\nLegislature also deleted from the definition the phrase â€œwhere the total\r\ncombined premiums to be paid for these policies for one insured is greater than\r\nfifty thousand dollars annually.â€&nbsp; See footnote 1.&nbsp;\r\nSimilarly, the Legislature in 2002\r\namended Sections 38-73-340 and 38-73-520 to change the phrases â€œlarge\r\ncommercial policiesâ€ and â€œexempt large commercial policiesâ€ to simply â€œexempt\r\ncommercial policies.â€&nbsp; See footnote 2.\r\nThese amendments mean insurers may\r\nsell exempt commercial policies to commercial insureds of all sizes, from\r\nmulti-national corporations to â€œmom-and-popâ€ operations.&nbsp; Therefore,\r\nsuch a policy may be presented not only to potentially knowledgeable risk\r\nmanagers for large corporations, as occurred in the present case, but also to\r\nless sophisticated and knowledgeable insureds who own or manage small\r\nbusinesses.&nbsp; The Legislature apparently recognized that fact and chose not\r\nto create an exemption for exempt commercial policies from the requirements of\r\nSection 38-77-160.&nbsp; Accordingly, we answer Question 2 â€œyes,â€ automobile\r\ninsurance carriers in South Carolina are required to make a meaningful offer of\r\noptional UIM coverage when selling an â€œexempt commercial policyâ€ as that\r\nterm is defined in Section 38-1-20(40).\r\n3.&nbsp; REQUIREMENT OF\r\nMEANINGFUL OFFER IN SALE OF FRONTING POLICY\r\nPlaintiff asserts the Legislature\r\nhas not exempted an insurer which sells a â€œfronting policyâ€ from making a\r\nmeaningful offer of UIM coverage to a commercial insured.&nbsp; Old Republic,\r\nrelying on foreign authority, argues it should not be required to make a\r\nmeaningful offer of UIM coverage when selling a fronting policy to a commercial\r\ninsured which wishes to reject all optional coverages.&nbsp; Old Republic further asserts Section 38-77-160 does not apply to its\r\nfronting policy because that policy was not â€œinsuranceâ€ which involved a\r\ntransfer of risk to Old Republic.&nbsp;\r\nâ€œFronting policiesâ€ and related\r\nforms of partial self-insurance have become prevalent since the 1980s due to\r\nincreases in insurance premiums.&nbsp; A fronting policy, of which there are\r\nvarious forms, is one or more steps removed from true self-insurance.&nbsp; It\r\nhas been defined as a legal risk management device, typically used by large\r\ncorporations operating in multiple states, in which the corporation pays a\r\ndiscounted premium to an insurer.&nbsp; The insurer maintains licensing and\r\nfiling capabilities in a particular state or states, and issues an insurance\r\npolicy covering the corporation in order to comply with the insurance laws and\r\nregulations of each state.\r\nThe corporation retains at least\r\npart of the risks covered under the fronting policy.&nbsp; One such means of\r\nretaining the risk, as seen in the present case, is by a deductible which equals\r\nthe policyâ€™s liability limits.&nbsp; The insured usually is left to administer\r\nall claims, although the insurer may reserve this authority to itself in some\r\ninstances.[3]&nbsp; The insured\r\nagrees to reimburse the insurer for all payments it must make.&nbsp; See MacDonald\r\nv. Pacific Employers Ins. Co., 264 F. Supp. 2d 576, 581-83 (N.D. Ohio 2002);\r\nLafferty v. Reliance Ins. Co., 109 F. Supp. 2d 837, 844-46 (S.D. Ohio\r\n2000); Aerojet General Corp. v. Transport Indem.

Barker, Combining Insurance and Self\r\nInsurance:&nbsp; Issues for Handling Claims, 61 Def. Couns. J. 352, 353\r\n(1994); 1 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance 3d Â§Â§\r\n10:1 to 10:3 (1997) (discussing self-insurance).\r\nSome courts and commentators have\r\nstated that insureds who purchase fronting policies are in the practical sense\r\nself-insured because such policies involve no transfer of risk from the insured\r\nto the insurer.&nbsp; We disagree with the premise there is no transfer of risk\r\nin such policies.&nbsp; In a fronting policy, â€œ[t]he insurer functions purely\r\nas a surety for the insuredâ€™s ability to pay claims, and the benefit extends\r\nonly to third parties in situations in which the policy holder is unable to pay\r\na liability owed to a third party.â€&nbsp; Goode, supra at 1257; see\r\nalso Barker, supra at 353 (stating same principle).&nbsp; Thus, Old Republic has assumed the risk - which\r\nit presumably has found acceptable based on Penskeâ€™s net worth and financial\r\ncapacity - that it will have to pay a claim if Penske becomes insolvent.\r\nWe find persuasive the views\r\nexpressed in Gilchrist v. Gonsor, 821 N.E.2d 154 (Ohio 2004).&nbsp; In\r\nthat case, decided on facts similar to the present case, an employee was injured\r\nin an on-the-job vehicle wreck caused by another motorist.&nbsp; The employee\r\nsought coverage under his employerâ€™s uninsured motorist (UM) policy, which was\r\na fronting policy in which the employerâ€™s deductible equaled the policyâ€™s\r\nliability limit of $1 million.\r\nThe Ohio Supreme Court explained\r\nthat the employer, in purchasing an insurance fronting policy, was not\r\nself-insured because it had not obtained a certificate of self-insurance under\r\nthe statutory process.&nbsp; Instead, the employer had established proof of\r\nfinancial responsibility as statutorily required by purchasing a contract of\r\ninsurance - the fronting policy.&nbsp; Under the statute then in effect, a\r\nvehicle liability policy could not be issued or delivered in Ohio\r\nunless UM coverage was offered to the policyholder.&nbsp; The court held this\r\nprovision applied to fronting policies.&nbsp; Id. at 156-57; see also\r\nCouch on Insurance 3d Â§ 10:1 (self-insurers in many states are required\r\nto comply with procedures to obtain a certificate of self insurance, and the\r\nreason for strictly enforcing such requirements is to protect the public).\r\nA concurring justice further\r\nexplained the courtâ€™s reasoning.&nbsp; â€œ[The employer] and [the insurer]\r\nseek to describe their contract of insurance for one purpose and as something\r\nelse for another purpose. . . . It is not consistent to argue that the contract\r\nis an insurance policy for purposes of complying with Ohioâ€™s financial\r\nresponsibility requirement and that the same policy is not one of insurance in\r\norder to avoid the mandatory UM/UIM offering under [Ohio law].â€&nbsp; Gilchrist,\r\n821 N.E.2d at 156-57 (Moyer, C.J., concurring).&nbsp; Furthermore, â€œit is\r\nclear that [the insurer] exposed itself to at least some risk.&nbsp; The fact\r\n[the insurer] carried some risk of loss further verifies that the arrangement in\r\nthis case was an insurance policy and is therefore subject to the previous\r\ndecisions of this court that create liability for UM/UIM coverage pursuant to\r\n[Ohio law].â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nIn South\r\nCarolina, â€œâ€˜[i]nsuranceâ€™ means a contract whereby one undertakes to\r\nindemnify another or pay a specified amount upon determinable contingencies.â€&nbsp;\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-1-20(19) (Supp. 2004).&nbsp; A â€œâ€˜[p]olicyâ€™ means a\r\ncontract of insurance.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-1-20(30) (Supp.\r\n2004).&nbsp; â€œâ€˜[A]utomobile insuranceâ€™ means automobile bodily injury and\r\nproperty damage liability insurance, including [a list of various forms of\r\nvehicle-related coverage] . . . as provided by this chapter written or offered\r\nby automobile insurers.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(1) (2002).\r\nIn the context of automobile\r\ninsurance, a person or corporation in South\r\nCarolina is required to provide proof of financial responsibility for potential\r\naccidents in order to legally operate a motor vehicle.&nbsp; Such financial\r\nresponsibility may consist of an insurance policy or surety bond with the\r\nrequired or optional coverages.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-10-10 to -40 and\r\n56-10-210 to -280 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2004) (requiring proof of insurance or other\r\nacceptable security in order to register motor vehicle and establishing fines\r\nand criminal penalties for failure to do so); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 38-77-140,\r\n-150, and -160 (2002) (establishing requirements of mandatory minimum insurance\r\nlimits, mandatory uninsured motorist coverage, and requiring automobile insurers\r\nto offer additional uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, respectively).\r\nA person, if eligible under\r\nstatutory requirements, may register an uninsured motor vehicle by paying a $550\r\nfee to the state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n56-10-510 to -540 (Supp. 2004).&nbsp; A company or person who has more than\r\ntwenty-five motor vehicles registered in his name may qualify as a self-insurer\r\nby meeting the statutory requirements and obtaining a certificate of\r\nself-insurance from the DMV.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-9-60 and 56-10-510\r\n(Supp. 2004).\r\nPenske complied with the financial\r\nresponsibility requirements by purchasing an insurance policy, not by seeking\r\napproval of a surety bond or obtaining a certificate of self-insurance from DMV\r\nas allowed by statute.&nbsp; Old Republic sold Penske a policy of\r\nautomobile insurance as those terms are statutorily defined, i.e., it\r\nsold Penske a contract of insurance which provided automobile bodily injury and\r\nproperty damage liability insurance.&nbsp; The fact Penske is required under the\r\npolicy to subsequently reimburse Old Republic\r\nfor claims paid up to the policy limits does not change the fact that Old Republic\r\nagreed to indemnify Penske, particularly since Old Republic\r\nhas assumed the risk of Penskeâ€™s insolvency, however slight. [4]\r\nMoreover, the fact Penske purchased\r\na so-called â€œfronting policyâ€ does not transform Penske into a self-insured\r\nentity entitled to avoid the requirements of South\r\nCarolina law.&nbsp; The Legislature has not defined such policies as a form of\r\nself-insurance; nor has the Legislature established an exception for fronting\r\npolicies from UIM-related requirements.&nbsp; Therefore, the laws of this state\r\napply with equal force to such policies.&nbsp; Neither Old Republic nor Penske, while acting\r\nlegitimately in their corporate self-interest to spend less money on insurance,\r\nare allowed to avoid statutory insurance requirements and unilaterally bestow\r\nupon Penske the classification of a self-insured entity.&nbsp; Accordingly, we\r\nanswer Question 3 â€œyes,â€ automobile insurance carriers in South Carolina are required to make a meaningful\r\noffer of optional UIM coverage when selling a â€œfronting policyâ€ in which the\r\ninsuredâ€™s deductible limits equal the liability limits.\r\n4.&nbsp; APPLICABILITY OF\r\nWANNAMAKER ANALYSIS IN SALE OF FRONTING POLICY\r\nPlaintiff argues the determination\r\nof whether an insurer has made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage is an\r\nobjective inquiry based on the language and form of the offer.&nbsp; It is\r\nneither necessary nor proper to consider the insuredâ€™s subjective state of\r\nmind or wishes.&nbsp;\r\nOld Republic asserts that, because\r\nPenske is a â€œknowledgeable, sophisticated insuredâ€ which repeatedly rejected\r\nUIM coverage, it should not have to comply with the requirements of State\r\nFarm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 345 S.E.2d 555\r\n(1987), and its progeny.&nbsp; Old Republic\r\nalso asks we find a meaningful offer was made in this case.&nbsp;\r\nWe recently set forth the basic\r\nprinciples of law regarding meaningful offers in Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v.\r\nLeachman, 362 S.C. 344, 608 S.E.2d 569 (2005):\r\n\r\n  The insurer bears the burden of\r\n  establishing it made a meaningful offer.&nbsp; Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 405, 475 S.E.2d 758,\r\n  759 (1996).&nbsp; A noncomplying offer has the legal effect of no offer at\r\n  all.&nbsp; Hanover Inc. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 301 S.C. 55, 57,\r\n  389 S.E.2d 657, 659 (1990).&nbsp; â€œIf the insurer fails to comply with its\r\n  statutory duty to make a meaningful offer to the insured, the policy will be\r\n  reformed, by operation of law, to include UIM coverage up to the limits of\r\n  liability insurance carried by the insured.â€&nbsp; Butler, 323 S.C. at 405, 475 S.E.2d at 760.&nbsp;\r\n  In general, for an insurer to make\r\n  a meaningful offer of UIM coverage, (1) the insurerâ€™s notification process\r\n  must be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing; (2) the insurer\r\n  must specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional\r\n  coverage in general terms; (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the\r\n  insured of the nature of the optional coverage; and (4) the insured must be\r\n  told that optional coverages are available for an additional premium.&nbsp; State\r\n  Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 345 S.E.2d 555, 556\r\n  (1987).\r\n  In response to Wannamaker,\r\n  the legislature enacted a statute establishing the requirements for forms used\r\n  in making offers of optional insurance coverage such as UIM.&nbsp; The statute\r\n  directs the insurer to include the following in its offer:\r\n  (1) a brief, concise explanation of the coverage;\r\n  (2) a list of available limits and the range of premiums for the limits;\r\n  (3) space for the insured to mark whether the insured chooses to accept or\r\n  reject the coverage, and a space to select the limits of coverage desired;\r\n  (4) a space for the insured to sign the form, acknowledging that the optional\r\n  coverage has been offered; and\r\n  (5) the mailing address and telephone number of the Department, so that the\r\n  insured may contact it with any questions that the insurance agent is unable\r\n  to answer.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A) (2002).\r\n  An insurer enjoys a presumption it\r\n  made a meaningful offer if it executes a form that complies with this\r\n  statute.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (2002); Antley v. Nobel Ins.\r\n  Co., 350 S.C. 621, 632, 567 S.E.2d 872, 878 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; If the\r\n  form does not comply with the statute, the insurer may not benefit from the\r\n  protections of the statute.&nbsp; Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319\r\n  S.C. 479, 486, 462 S.E.2d 291, 295 (Ct. App. 1995).&nbsp; Furthermore, a form\r\n  does not necessarily constitute a meaningful offer simply because it was\r\n  approved by the Department of Insurance.&nbsp; Butler, 323 S.C. at 408-409, 475 S.E.2d at 761.\r\n\r\nProgressive Cas. Ins. Co.,\r\n362 S.C. at ___, 608 S.E.2d at 571-72.\r\nWe answer Question 4 â€œyes,â€ an\r\nautomobile insurer selling a fronting policy to a commercial insured is required\r\nto comply with Wannamaker and its progeny in order to make a meaningful\r\noffer of UIM coverage even though the insured has expressed a desire not to\r\npurchase such coverage.&nbsp; Automobile insurers offering commercial policies,\r\nincluding fronting policies, are not exempt from the meaningful offer\r\nrequirement contained in Section 38-77-160 because the Legislature has\r\nrecognized that commercial insureds, like non-commercial insureds, undoubtedly\r\nrun the gamut from the ill-informed to knowledgeable purchasers.\r\nWhether a meaningful offer was made\r\ndepends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, and the inquiry in\r\nthis instance must be resolved in the federal proceeding.&nbsp; The impact of\r\nthe insuredâ€™s knowledge or level of sophistication regarding insurance matters\r\non the determination of whether a meaningful offer was made cannot be decided on\r\nthe limited record and arguments presented to us. &nbsp;Instead, such a decision\r\nis more appropriately resolved by a factfinder which has an opportunity to\r\nconsider the entire factual record and the partiesâ€™ arguments.\r\nEvidence of an insuredâ€™s knowledge\r\nor level of sophistication is not relevant when the analysis is confined to\r\nwhether a particular written form complies with the statutory requirements, such\r\nthat the insurer enjoys a presumption that it made a meaningful offer.&nbsp;\r\nThat analysis simply involves a review of the written form itself.\r\nHowever, evidence of the insuredâ€™s\r\nknowledge or level of sophistication is relevant and admissible when analyzing,\r\nunder Wannamaker, whether an insurer intelligibly advised the insured of\r\nthe nature of the optional UM or UIM coverage.&nbsp; It is a subjective inquiry\r\nto the extent the insured may offer evidence of his understanding, or lack\r\nthereof, of the nature of UM or UIM coverage.&nbsp; It also is an objective\r\ninquiry because the factfinder should consider the insuredâ€™s knowledge and\r\nlevel of sophistication in determining whether the insurer intelligibly\r\nexplained such coverage to the insured.&nbsp; See McDowell v.\r\nTravelers Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., 357 S.C. 118, 123-25, 590 S.E.2d 514, 516-17\r\n(Ct. App. 2003) (affirming grant of summary judgment to insurer on issue of\r\nwhether a meaningful offer was made under Wannamaker when evidence\r\nrevealed commercial insuredâ€™s professional risk manager was experienced in\r\ndealing with vehicle insurance coverage, was fully aware of nature and purpose\r\nof UIM coverage, and knew and was able to apply the mathematical formula for\r\ncalculating UIM premiums under the policy); Anders v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut.\r\nIns. Co., 307 S.C. 371, 375-76, 415 S.E.2d 406, 408-09\r\n(Ct.

Ins. Co., 362 S.C. at ___, 608 S.E.2d at 573.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe answer â€œyesâ€ to each\r\ncertified question.&nbsp; First, the policy at issue is an exempt commercial\r\npolicy.&nbsp; Second, an insurer selling an automobile insurance policy must\r\nmake a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to a commercial insured because the\r\nLegislature has not established an exception for exempt commercial\r\npolicies.&nbsp; Third, an insurer selling an automobile insurance policy, issued\r\nin the form of a fronting policy, must make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage\r\nbecause it is an insurance policy and the Legislature has not established an\r\nexception for such a policy.&nbsp; Fourth, an insurer selling an automobile\r\ninsurance policy, issued in the form of a fronting policy, to a commercial\r\ninsured is required to comply with Wannamaker and its progeny in order to\r\nmake a meaningful offer of UIM coverage even though the insured has expressed a\r\ndesire not to purchase such coverage.&nbsp; Whether a meaningful offer was made\r\nin the present case is a fact-intensive inquiry which must be resolved in the\r\nfederal proceeding.\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:&nbsp; I\r\nconcur in all respects with the comprehensive and well reasoned analysis of the\r\nmajority with one exception.&nbsp; I would go further in answering Question 4\r\nand also find that the offer of optional insurance by Old Republic\r\nconstituted a meaningful offer.&nbsp;\r\nFor an insurer to make a meaningful\r\noffer of additional coverage, (1) the insurerâ€™s notification process must be\r\ncommercially reasonable; (2) the insurer must specify the limits of optional\r\ncoverage and not merely offer additional coverage in general terms; (3) the\r\ninsurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional\r\ncoverage; and (4) the insured must be told that optional coverages are available\r\nfor an additional premium.&nbsp; State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.\r\nWannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 345 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1987).\r\nIn the present case, in my opinion,\r\nthe above requirements for making a meaningful offer were satisfied.&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, in my view, Old Republic made a meaningful offer.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The Legislature has amended Section 38-1-20(40) to delete\r\nthe adjective â€œlargeâ€ from commercial insureds and to eliminate the\r\nrequirement of an annual premium exceeding $50,000.&nbsp; The subsection in its\r\npresent form provides\r\n\r\n  â€œExempt commercial policiesâ€\r\n  means policies for commercial insureds as may be provided for in regulation\r\n  issued by the director.&nbsp; Exempt commercial policies include all property\r\n  and casualty coverages except for insurance related to credit transactions\r\n  written through financial institutions.\r\n\r\nAct No. 300 Â§ 1, 2002 Acts 3288\r\n(effective January 1, 2003).&nbsp; The Actâ€™s title stated the subsection was\r\nbeing amended â€œto expand the meaning of â€˜exempt commercial policies.â€™â€\r\nThe Legislature re-enacted Section\r\n38-1-20(40) in identical form in 2003 while revising or adding statutes relating\r\nto numerous insurance laws.&nbsp; Act No. 73 Â§ 1, 2003 Acts 847 (effective June\r\n25, 2003).&nbsp; The Actâ€™s title stated the subsection was being amended â€œto\r\nchange the definition of â€˜exempt commercial policiesâ€™ to delete the\r\nrequirement that the definition include policies for which premiums for one\r\ninsured is greater than fifty thousand dollars annually.â€\r\n[2]&nbsp; The Legislature\r\namended these sections in 2002.&nbsp; In pertinent part, the sections were\r\nmodified to change the phrases â€œlarge commercial policiesâ€ and â€œexempt\r\nlarge commercial policiesâ€ to simply â€œexempt commercial policies.â€&nbsp;\r\nAct No. 300 Â§Â§ 2-3, 2002 Acts 3288.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Penske apparently does not administer its own claims\r\nprocess, although the limited record before us does not reveal the precise\r\narrangement.&nbsp; Old Republic states in its brief that â€œPenske\r\nnegotiates its own premiums, covers its own losses throughout the country, and\r\npays a premium only to cover the vast administrative expenses associated with\r\nsuch an arrangement.â€&nbsp; At oral argument, counsel for Old Republic stated\r\nthat claims against Penske are handled by a third-party administrator.&nbsp; The\r\nfact that an entity other than Penske administers the claims process lends\r\nfurther support to the conclusion Penske is not self-insured, but purchased an\r\ninsurance policy.\r\n[4]&nbsp; Events in recent years repeatedly have demonstrated the\r\nfallacy of the belief that a large corporation with billions of dollars in\r\nrevenue or assets is an invincible operation with little risk of collapse.&nbsp;\r\nTo understand this, one has to look no further than the accounting scandals and\r\nbankruptcies at companies such as Worldcom, Inc. ($103.9 billion in assets upon\r\nfiling bankruptcy in 2002); Enron Corp. ($63.4 billion in assets upon filing in\r\n2001); Conseco, Inc., ($61.4 billion in assets upon filing in 2002); Texaco,\r\nInc. ($35.9 billion in assets upon filing in 1987); or Adelphia Communications\r\n($21.5 billion in assets upon filing in 2002).&nbsp; See â€œThe Largest\r\nBankruptcies - 1980 to Present,â€ compiled by New Generation Research, Inc.\r\n(available at http://www.bankruptcydata.com/Research/ 15_Largest.htm).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26033","title":"In the Matter of Rabb","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26033","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary opinion in which the Court imposed a ninety day definite suspension.","date":"2005-08-29","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:windowtext;}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent\r\n\t{text-indent:.75in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent2\r\n\t{text-indent:1.0in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH\r\nCAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Johnny W.\r\n        Rabb, Jr.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26033\r\nSubmitted August 2, 2005 - Filed August 29, 2005\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Henry B.

Whiten, Jr., of Anderson, for respondent.&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp;&nbsp; In\r\nthis attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant\r\nto Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp; In the Agreement, respondent admits\r\nmisconduct and consents to the imposition of a two year suspension from the\r\npractice of law.&nbsp;&nbsp; We accept the Agreement and impose a two year\r\nsuspension from the practice of law.&nbsp; The facts, as set forth in the\r\nAgreement, are as follows.&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn or about October 2001, respondent\r\nwas retained by Clients A and B to represent them in a bankruptcy\r\nproceeding.&nbsp; In March 2003, Clients A and B scheduled an appointment with\r\nrespondent to sign documents related to their case.&nbsp; When Clients A and B\r\narrived for their appointment, respondent informed them that, due to personal\r\nproblems, their documents were not ready to be signed.&nbsp; Respondent asked\r\nthe clients to return the following day.&nbsp; Clients A and B returned the\r\nfollowing day and the documents were signed without further incident.&nbsp;\r\nSubsequent to signing the documents, there was a considerable period of time in\r\nwhich Clients A and B either failed to receive any information from respondent\r\nor were given incorrect information by respondentâ€™s staff.\r\nBy letter dated April 3, 2003, ODC\r\nnotified respondent of the complaint Clients A and B had filed against him and\r\nthe fifteen (15) day time period in which to file a response.&nbsp; After no\r\nresponse was received before the stated deadline, ODC sent an additional letter\r\nto respondent pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290\r\nS.E.2d 240 (1982).&nbsp; Ultimately, respondent submitted a response.&nbsp;\r\nRespondent admits he was less than timely in communicating with the Attorney to\r\nAssist Disciplinary Counsel. &nbsp;Respondent concedes that, during this period,\r\nhe was under significant stress from an ongoing custody action with his ex-wife\r\nand that he was resorting to an improper use of alcohol to cope with his\r\nproblems.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent was the plaintiff in a\r\nfamily court action.&nbsp; Respondent was present for the November 11, 2002\r\nhearing during which the family court ordered both respondent and the defendant\r\nto submit to hair strand drug tests and to produce the results of the tests\r\nwithin ten (10) days.&nbsp; Respondent did not submit to his drug test until\r\nDecember 9, 2002, in violation of the courtâ€™s order. The results of the\r\nDecember 9, 2002 test noted respondent tested positive for cocaine.&nbsp; The\r\ndefendant filed a rule to show cause.&nbsp; On June 20, 2003, the family court\r\nfound respondent in willful contempt of the courtâ€™s November 11, 2002 order by\r\nhis failure to submit to a hair strand drug test within ten (10) days of the\r\ndate of the order.&nbsp;\r\nMatter III\r\nOn or about October 31, 2002,\r\nrespondent filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy action on behalf of a client.&nbsp;\r\nSubsequent to the filing, respondent took over representation of the clientâ€™s\r\nongoing workerâ€™s compensation case.&nbsp; On or about January 3, 2003, the\r\nbankruptcy trustee filed a Petition to Dismiss the bankruptcy action due to\r\nnonpayment.\r\nOn or about January 27, 2003,\r\nrespondent assisted his client in obtaining a loan from the complainant in this\r\nmatter.&nbsp; The loan was to be repaid through the proceeds of the workerâ€™s\r\ncompensation action.&nbsp; Respondent submitted the loan application to the\r\ncomplainant on behalf of respondent and his client.&nbsp; Respondent failed to\r\nnotify the complainant of the clientâ€™s bankruptcy filing at the time he\r\nsubmitted the loan application.&nbsp; Although the clientâ€™s bankruptcy action\r\nwas ultimately dismissed, respondent actively assisted his client in obtaining a\r\npersonal loan without making full disclosure of all relevant financial\r\ninformation.&nbsp;\r\nMatter IV\r\nOn or about September 3, 2003,\r\nrespondent was arrested and charged with trespass after notice. The homeowner,\r\nrespondentâ€™s step-daughter, contacted law enforcement after respondent refused\r\nto leave her residence.&nbsp; When law enforcement arrived, respondent appeared\r\nintoxicated and repeated he was not going to leave.&nbsp; Despite several\r\nattempts by law enforcement to convince respondent to voluntarily leave the\r\npremises, including enlisting the aid of respondentâ€™s wife to persuade him to\r\nleave, respondent refused to leave.&nbsp; Leaving no alternative, respondent was\r\nplaced under arrest and transported to the detention center.&nbsp; Respondent\r\nrepresents he pled guilty to the offense of trespass and paid a small\r\nfine.&nbsp;\r\nMatter V\r\nIn or about April 2003, respondent\r\nwas retained to handle a bankruptcy claim.&nbsp; After a confirmation hearing in\r\nAugust 2003, respondentâ€™s clients began making payments to the trustee.\r\n&nbsp;The clients were assured that everything was in order, although respondent\r\nrepresents he informed the clients that the trustee had recommended that certain\r\nchanges be made to the Chapter 13 plan.&nbsp; Respondent admits there was a\r\nbreakdown in communications between himself and his clients and that he failed\r\nto ensure that his clients had a complete and full understanding of their case.\r\nMatter VI\r\nIn or around 2001, respondent\r\nrepresented a client in a domestic action.&nbsp; The client resided in North Carolina.&nbsp; Respondent made an appearance on behalf of the\r\nclient at a hearing in North\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; At the time of the hearing, respondent was not licensed to\r\npractice law in North Carolina.\r\nMatter VII\r\nAware that ODC was investigating his\r\nconduct, respondent removed several file cabinets containing numerous client\r\nfiles from his office and stored them at his residence.&nbsp; After respondent\r\nwas placed on interim suspension,[1]\r\nthe attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests (APCI) contacted\r\nrespondent to take possession of his client files.&nbsp; Initially, respondent\r\ndid not turn over the client files stored at his residence.&nbsp; When the APCI\r\ndiscovered that respondent may have been keeping client files at his residence,\r\nthe APCI informed respondent he must immediately turn over all client\r\nfiles.&nbsp; Respondent provided several excuses why he could not produce the\r\nfiles until a later date.&nbsp; Eventually, respondent provided the APCI with\r\nthe additional client files.&nbsp; Upon information and belief, respondent\r\nprovided all client files in his possession to the APCI. &nbsp;\r\nRespondent represents that a\r\nsignificant factor during the period of time of his misconduct was his very\r\ncontentious divorce and custody action with his first wife.&nbsp; Respondent\r\nrepresents that before and/or during this marital discord, he hired an employee\r\nas his paralegal and office manager.[2]\r\n&nbsp;Respondent admits he allowed this employee to control every aspect of his\r\nlaw office, including but not limited to, relinquishing authority to make\r\ndecisions regarding the representation of his clients.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that his\r\nmisconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically\r\nRule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any\r\nother rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers),\r\nRule 7(a)(2) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in\r\nconduct in violation of the applicable rules of professional conduct of another\r\njurisdiction), Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to\r\npollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal\r\nprofession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice\r\nlaw), and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\nwillfully violate a valid court order issued by a court of this state). &nbsp;In\r\naddition, respondent admits he has violated the following provisions of the\r\nRules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: &nbsp;Rule 1.1\r\n(lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer\r\nshall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client);\r\nRule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter\r\nand promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer\r\nshall promptly deliver property that third party is entitled to receive); Rule\r\n3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with\r\ninterests of the client); Rule 3.4 (lawyer shall not knowingly disobey an\r\nobligation under the rules of a tribunal); Rule 4.1 (in the course of\r\nrepresenting a client, a lawyer shall not fail to disclosed a material fact to a\r\nthird person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a fraudulent act by\r\na client); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction where doing\r\nso violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction); Rule\r\n8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for\r\ninformation from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not\r\nviolate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (lawyer shall not commit\r\na criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty,\r\ntrustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it\r\nshall be professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving\r\nmoral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving\r\ndishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall\r\nnot engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). &nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for\r\nDiscipline by Consent and impose a two year definite suspension from the\r\npractice of law.&nbsp; During the suspension, respondent shall continue to\r\nparticipate in any counseling and/or treatment recommended by his\r\npsychologist.&nbsp; Respondentâ€™s psychologist shall submit quarterly\r\nevaluations of respondentâ€™s progress to ODC throughout the duration of the\r\nsuspension.&nbsp; In addition, if respondent seeks reinstatement to the practice\r\nof law, he shall submit a report from his psychologist to ODC which addresses\r\nhis mental fitness to resume the practice of law.&nbsp; This report shall be\r\nsubmitted to ODC at least sixty (60) days prior to filing any petition for\r\nreinstatement.&nbsp; Respondentâ€™s request that the suspension be applied\r\nretroactively to the date of his interim suspension is denied.&nbsp; Within\r\nfifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\nwith the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule\r\n413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER,\r\nBURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On September 23, 2003, respondent was placed on interim\r\nsuspension.&nbsp;

Austin Hood, of\r\n        Brown &amp; Brehmer, of Columbia, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:&nbsp; The\r\ntrial court granted respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment in appellantâ€™s\r\nwrongful death action.&nbsp; In this case, we are asked to determine whether a\r\nsocial host should be subject to liability when the host has provided alcohol to\r\na person less than 21 years of age and that person is subsequently injured or\r\ndies.\r\nFACTS\r\nLinda Marcum, as Personal\r\nRepresentative of the estate of Justin Michael Parks (Parks),[1] brought this wrongful death action that arose from\r\na one-car accident in which her son was killed.&nbsp; Parks, who was 19 years\r\nold, had consumed alcohol before the accident and, at the time of his death, had\r\na blood alcohol content of 0.291%.&nbsp; An expert witness testified Parksâ€™\r\nblood alcohol content indicated he was seriously intoxicated and that he would\r\nhave been visibly drunk, have trouble walking, and have slurred speech.\r\nPrior to\r\nthe accident, Parks attended a cookout held at the home of respondents, Donald\r\nand Gloria Bowden (hereinafter â€œthe Bowdensâ€).&nbsp; The cookout was held\r\nfor social and business promotional purposes.&nbsp; Mr. Bowden gave a general\r\ninvitation to the cookout to a group of people he saw while at Shealy Electricalâ€™s\r\noffice.\r\nParks, who was employed by Shealy\r\nElectrical, rode to the cookout with his supervisor, Timothy Hensley (Mr.\r\nHensley).&nbsp; At the party, the Bowdens placed soft drinks and beer in a â€œwashtubâ€\r\non the deck and expected their guests to help themselves to the beverage of\r\ntheir choice.&nbsp; Respondent Utility Service Agency, Inc. reimbursed Mr.\r\nBowden for the cost of food and drinks, including liquor.&nbsp; The Bowdens did\r\nnot take any precautions to ensure those who were drinking alcohol were over 21\r\nyears of age.&nbsp; No one from Shealy Electrical informed the Bowdens that\r\nParks was under 21 and could not legally drink alcohol.&nbsp; Mr. Bowden assumed\r\nParks was at least 21 years old because of his employment, because he had seen\r\nhim drinking at a bar before, and because he had overheard him in Shealy\r\nElectricalâ€™s office talking about drinking shots in bars.[2]\r\nAt the cookout, Parks drank beer and\r\nseveral tequila shots.&nbsp; Jim Woods, a co-worker of Parks who did not know\r\nParksâ€™ age, asked Parks what he was doing after seeing him take at least three\r\nshots of tequila within ten minutes.&nbsp; Parks replied he was â€œjust trying\r\nto get a buzz.â€&nbsp; Mr. Bowden did not remember seeing Parks drink but he\r\nassumed he was drinking.\r\nMr. Hensley and the Bowdens\r\ntestified that, upon leaving the party to ride home with the Hensleys, Parks did\r\nnot have trouble walking and his speech was not slurred.&nbsp; Mrs. Bowden\r\ntestified that when Parks left, he hugged her and thanked her for allowing him\r\nto come to the cookout.&nbsp; She felt his condition was fine.&nbsp; However,\r\nMrs. Hensley, who drove Mr. Hensley and Parks from the party to their house,\r\ntestified that when Parks left the party, he was walking fine, but his speech\r\nwas slurred.&nbsp; Mrs. Hensley did not consume any alcohol that night.\r\nOnce arriving to the Hensley home,\r\nMr. Hensley detained Parks because he wanted Parks to sober up before going to\r\nanother party.&nbsp; He stated he did not serve Parks alcohol; however, Parks\r\nattempted to drink one minibottle, which Mr. Hensley poured out after Parks had\r\ntaken one sip.&nbsp; As soon as Mr. Hensley poured the first minibottle out,\r\nParks pulled another minibottle out of his pocket and drank it down at\r\nonce.&nbsp; Parks continued to attempt to leave, but Mr. Hensley continued to\r\ndelay him because he did not want Parks to drive.&nbsp; Finally, Mr. Hensley did\r\nnot feel he could further prevent Parks from driving away and Parks left.[3]\r\nBefore trial on Parksâ€™ wrongful\r\ndeath action, respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment was granted.&nbsp; The\r\ncourt found Parksâ€™ first-party action was precluded because he was a\r\nvoluntarily intoxicated first party and was an adult for all other purposes and\r\nwas prevented from consuming alcohol only by statutory authority.&nbsp; The\r\ncourt also found Parksâ€™ negligence exceeded that of respondents because he\r\nvoluntarily became intoxicated and none of the defendants knew he was under 21\r\nyears of age.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err by\r\n    finding an underage person possesses full social and civil rights?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Do underage persons, injured as\r\n    a result of being provided alcohol, have a first-party claim against the\r\n    social hosts who provide them alcohol?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err by\r\n    finding Parks is barred from recovery pursuant to the doctrine of\r\n    comparative negligence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nScope of Review\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only\r\nif there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled\r\nto judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping\r\nHands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 575 S.E.2d 549 (2003).&nbsp; In determining\r\nwhether any triable issues of fact exist for summary judgment purposes, the\r\nevidence and all the inferences that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence\r\nmust be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Id.\r\nI\r\nParks argues the trial court erred\r\nby finding he was not a legal minor and was not under a legal disability.&nbsp;\r\nThe court based its finding on the following constitutional provision:\r\n\r\n  Every citizen who is eighteen\r\n  years of age or older, not laboring under disabilities prescribed in this\r\n  Constitution or otherwise established by law, shall be deemed sui juris\r\n  and endowed with full legal rights and responsibilities, provided, that the\r\n  General Assembly may restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons until\r\n  age twenty-one.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. Art. XVII, Â§ 14.&nbsp;\r\nThe court stated this provision allows for the restriction of the sale of\r\nalcoholic beverages to persons under age 21, but it does not remove legal rights\r\nand responsibilities from persons between the ages of 18 and 21, nor does it\r\ndeem those persons disabled.&nbsp; The court concluded Parks possessed full\r\nsocial and civil rights.\r\nWhile persons aged 18 to 20 are\r\ndeemed minors for purposes of the laws regarding alcoholic beverages, those\r\npersons are not minors in other respects.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n15-1-320(a) (2005) (all references to minors in law of this State shall be\r\ndeemed to mean persons under age of eighteen years except in laws relating to\r\nsale of alcoholic beverages).&nbsp; See also Norton v. Opening Break\r\nof Aiken, Inc., 313 S.C. 508, 443 S.E.2d 406 (Ct. App. 1994), affâ€™d,\r\n319 S.C. 469, 462 S.E.2d 861 (1995) (while drinkers aged eighteen to twenty are sui\r\njuris in all other respects, meaning they are legally presumed to have adult\r\nmental and judgmental capacity, and need less protection from harming themselves\r\nthan younger drinkers, their drinking still poses a high risk of harm to\r\nothers).&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial court did not err by finding Parks\r\npossessed full social and civil rights.\r\nII\r\nThe overriding issue in this case is\r\nwhether a social host should be subject to liability when the host has provided\r\nalcohol to a person less than 21 years of age and that person is subsequently\r\ninjured or dies.\r\nBackground of South\r\nCarolina Case Law\r\nIn the commercial vendor setting, we\r\nhave held there is no first-party cause of action against a tavern owner by an\r\nintoxicated adult predicated on a statutory violation.&nbsp; Tobias v.\r\nSports Club, Inc., 332 S.C. 90, 504 S.E.2d 318 (1998).&nbsp; In Tobias,\r\nwe stated the right of injured third parties to maintain a negligence suit\r\nagainst a tavern owner based upon statutory violations is retained and we also\r\nstated that â€œ[w]e leave for another day the issue whether we will recognize a\r\nfirst-party action brought by a minor.â€ &nbsp;See also Whitlaw v.\r\nKroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251 (1991) (statutory prohibitions\r\nagainst selling alcohol to underage person creates private right of action if\r\nthird-party plaintiff can establish negligence per se and causation); Norton\r\nv. Opening Break of Aiken, Inc., 313 S.C. 508, 443 S.E.2d 406 (Ct. App.\r\n1994), affâ€™d, 319 S.C. 469, 462 S.E.2d 861 (1995) (alcoholic beverage\r\nlicensee had duty not to allow persons less than 21 years of age to possess or\r\nconsume alcohol on its premises; duty runs to third parties who could be injured\r\nby intoxicated underage drivers).\r\nIn the social host setting, the\r\nappellate courts of this state have stated that a social host is not liable at\r\ncommon law for service of alcohol to an intoxicated adult who\r\nsubsequently injures a third party.&nbsp; See Carson v. Adgar, 326\r\nS.C. 212, 219, n.4, 486 S.E.2d 3, 6, n.4 (1997); Garren v. Cummings &amp;\r\nMcCrady, Inc., 289 S.C. 348, 345 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 1986).[4]\r\nThe question whether an underage\r\nperson may recover for injuries he sustained after being â€œserved or furnishedâ€\r\nalcohol by a social host has not been answered in this state.\r\nApplicable South\r\nCarolina Statutory Law\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-90\r\n(Supp. 2004) provides:\r\n\r\n  It is unlawful for a person to\r\n  transfer or give to a person under the age of twenty-one years for the purpose\r\n  of consumption beer or wine at any place in the State.&nbsp; A person who\r\n  violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be\r\n  fined not more than two hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty\r\n  days.&nbsp; A person found guilty of a violation of Section 61-6-4070[5] and this section may not be\r\n  sentenced under both sections for the same offense.\r\n  The provisions of this section do\r\n  not apply to a spouse over the age of twenty-one giving beer or wine to his\r\n  spouse under the age of twenty-one in their home; to a parent or guardian over\r\n  the age of twenty-one giving beer or wine to his children or wards under the\r\n  age of twenty-one in their home; or to a person giving beer or wine to another\r\n  person under the age of twenty-one in conjunction with a religious ceremony or\r\n  purpose if the beer or wine was lawfully purchased.\r\n  The provisions of this section do\r\n  not apply to a person who gives, serves, or permits to be served any beer,\r\n  ale, porter, wine, or other similar malt or fermented beverage to a student\r\n  under the age of twenty-one [and above the age of eighteen] if [the alcoholic\r\n  beverage is to be used in the classroom setting.]\r\n\r\nThere is no statute in South Carolina regarding civil liability for a person who sells or\r\ngives alcohol to an underage person.\r\nPersuasive Authority\r\nThe question of whether a social\r\nhost should be civilly liable for â€œserving or furnishingâ€ alcohol to an\r\nunderage person has been addressed in other states with varying results.\r\nSome courts have found that any\r\nchange in the law governing alcohol-related liability should only be made by the\r\nstate legislature.&nbsp; See, e.g., Wakulich v. Mraz, 785 N.E.2d\r\n843 (Ill. 2003) (judicial restraint in this area is appropriate and any decision\r\nto expand civil liability of social hosts should be made by legislature); Reeder\r\nv. Daniel, 61 S.W.3d 359 (Tex. 2001) (Texas court has deferred to\r\nLegislature and declined to recognize social-host liability for serving guests\r\nfrom ages eighteen to twenty and for guests under age eighteen). &nbsp;At least\r\none court has not imposed liability based on a specific statute stating that a\r\nperson who provides alcohol to another is not civilly liable for any resulting\r\ndamages.&nbsp; See, e.g., Chokwak v. Worley, 912 P.2d 1248 (Alaska\r\n1996) (statute conferring upon â€œperson who provides alcoholic beveragesâ€ to\r\nanother civil immunity from liability for injuries resulting from intoxication\r\nof that person encompasses social hosts who provide alcohol to minors).\r\nâ€œMost of the courts that have\r\nfound a social host potentially liable for the alcohol-related injuries or death\r\nof a minor to whom he or she furnished alcohol have done so on the basis that\r\nthe host violated a state statute providing that the sale or gift of alcohol to\r\na minor is a criminal misdemeanor,â€ such as S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-90.&nbsp;\r\nDiane Schmauder Kane, Annotation, Social Hostâ€™s Liability for Death or\r\nInjuries Incurred by Person to Whom Alcohol was Served, 54 A.L.R.5th\r\n313 (1997).&nbsp; The Annotation explains that â€œ[t]he rationale of these\r\ncourts has been that the violation of such a penal statute constitutes either\r\nevidence of negligence or negligence per se on the part of the alcohol\r\nprovider.â€&nbsp; See Hansen v. Friend, 824 P.2d 483 (Wash. 1992)\r\n(statute making it criminal act for â€œany personâ€ to give liquor to minor\r\nimposes duty of care on social hosts not to serve liquor to minors); Longstreth\r\nv. Gensel, 377 N.W.2d 804 (Mich. 1985) (social host liability imposed based\r\non statute stating person who knowingly furnishes liquor to person less than 21\r\nyears of age or fails to make diligent inquiry regarding personâ€™s age is\r\nguilty of misdemeanor); Congini by Congini v. Portersville Valve Company,\r\n470 A.2d 515 (Pa. 1983) (social host negligent per se in serving alcohol\r\nto point of intoxication to person less than 21 years of age).&nbsp; But see\r\nHickingbotham v. Burke, 662 A.2d 297 (N.H. 1995) (statute barring\r\nlicensee, salesperson, or â€œany other personâ€ from providing alcohol to\r\nunderage person did not grant civil right of action on which guest could base\r\npersonal injury claim against hosts; however, underage person who is injured as\r\nresult of social hostâ€™s service of alcohol may maintain action against host\r\nbased on reckless service of alcohol).\r\nFrom a perusal of persuasive\r\nauthority, we find no clear statement of a majority rule on this issue.\r\nPublic Policy Arguments in\r\nFavor of Finding a Duty\r\nOne public policy argument in favor\r\nof finding a social host liable for furnishing alcohol to an underage guest who\r\nsubsequently injures himself is the basic goal of deterring the consumption of\r\nalcohol by underage persons.&nbsp; See Batten by Batten v. Bobo,\r\n528 A.2d 572 (N.J. Super. 1986) (New Jersey has recognized a clearly-stated\r\npolicy that it opposes drinking by minors; acknowledging minorâ€™s cause of\r\naction against social host who violates law by providing minor with alcoholic\r\nbeverages would have deterrent effect Legislature desires).&nbsp; If social\r\nhosts are aware they can potentially be found liable for the injuries sustained\r\nby an underage guest, then social hosts will be more vigilant about who is\r\nconsuming alcohol at their social gatherings.&nbsp; A vigilant host would\r\ngreatly decrease the ability of an underage person to consume alcohol at a\r\nsocial gathering.\r\nAnother policy reason for imposing a\r\nduty to protect underage persons from the effects of alcohol is that minors, as\r\na class, are incompetent by reason of their youth and inexperience to deal\r\nresponsibly with the effects of alcohol.&nbsp; Cf. Norton v. Opening\r\nBreak of Aiken, Inc., supra (purpose of alcoholic beverage regulation\r\nis to prevent consumption of alcohol by youthful drinkers so as to protect them\r\nfrom their own immature judgment).&nbsp; See Busby v. Quail Creek Golf\r\nand Country Club, 885 P.2d 1326 (Okla. 1994) (states which have recognized\r\nthe imposition of the duty to protect minors from alcoholâ€™s effects on commercial\r\nvendors have generally concluded that minors as a class are incompetent by\r\nreason of youth and inexperience to deal responsibly with the effects of\r\nalcohol); Congini by Congini v. Portersville Valve Company, 470 A.2d 515\r\n(Pa. 1983) (Pennsylvania legislature has made judgment that persons under\r\ntwenty-one years of age are incompetent to handle alcohol); Richard Smith, Note,\r\nA Comparative Analysis of Dramshop Liability and a Proposal for a Uniform\r\nLegislation, 25 J. Corp. L. 553, 560 (2000) (Congress and the legislatures\r\nof all fifty states have decided that, as a class, persons under the age of\r\ntwenty-one are not mature enough to consume alcohol responsibly).\r\nAnalysis and Conclusion\r\nAfter reviewing the above authority\r\nand public policy arguments, we conclude that social host liability should be\r\nimposed in the first-party underage person claim situation.&nbsp; This is\r\nconsistent with our holding in Tobias.&nbsp; While Tobias involved\r\na commercial vendor, we recognized that underage persons should be treated\r\ndifferently than adults who become intoxicated and injure themselves.&nbsp;\r\nFurther, this decision is consistent with the purpose behind sections 61-4-90\r\nand 61-6-4070, which make it unlawful for a person to transfer or give alcohol\r\nto a person under twenty-one years of age.&nbsp; Those statutes are designed to\r\nprevent harm to the minor who purchased the alcohol.&nbsp; See also Whitlaw\r\nv. Kroger Co., supra (statutes involving unlawfulness of selling\r\nalcohol to person less than twenty-one years of age are designed to prevent harm\r\nto underage person who purchased the alcohol).\r\nAdditionally, Parks meets the test\r\nto determine when a duty created by a statute will support an action for\r\nnegligence.&nbsp; Under Whitlaw v. Kroger Co., supra, the\r\nplaintiff must show two things:&nbsp; (1) that the essential purpose of the\r\nstatute is to protect from the kind of harm the plaintiff has suffered; and (2)\r\nthat he is a member of the class of persons the statute is intended to\r\nprotect.&nbsp; Clearly, the essential purpose of statutes prohibiting a person\r\nfrom giving or transferring alcohol to an underage person is to protect the\r\nunderage person from harm, including injuries sustained or death, after imbibing\r\nalcohol provided by such person.&nbsp; Parks, therefore, meets the first\r\nrequirement.&nbsp; He also meets the second requirement because he is less than\r\ntwenty-one years of age and he is a member of the class sought to be protected\r\nby Â§Â§ 61-4-90 and 61-6-4070.\r\nIn\r\nconclusion, finding a duty on the part of a social host in this situation is a\r\nnatural progression of our case law.&nbsp; The imposition of liability is based\r\non the fact that the host violated state statutes providing that the transfer or\r\ngift of alcohol to an underage person is a criminal misdemeanor.&nbsp; A finding\r\nof social host liability is supported by other jurisdictions and is supported by\r\npublic policy arguments regarding the incompetency and immaturity of minors and\r\nthe effort to deter minors from consuming alcohol.\r\nAlthough\r\nwe impose a duty on social hosts that previously did not exist, minor plaintiffs\r\nare still required to prove their social hosts breached that duty and that the\r\nhostsâ€™ alleged breach caused the minorâ€™s injuries.&nbsp; If Parks can show\r\nthat the Bowdens breached their duty to him by violating the statute, then he\r\nwill have established negligence per se.&nbsp; See Whitlaw v.\r\nKroger Co., supra (once plaintiff shows statute created duty to\r\nplaintiff and that defendant breached that duty by violating statute, then\r\nplaintiff has established negligence per se).&nbsp; However, Parks will\r\nthen still have to establish a causal connection between the Bowdensâ€™ alleged\r\nnegligence and his death.&nbsp; Whitlaw, supra (once he has shown\r\nnegligence per se, plaintiff must then show causal connection between\r\ndefendantâ€™s negligence and plaintiffâ€™s injury before plaintiff is entitled\r\nto damages; violation of statute is not conclusive of liability); Scott v.\r\nGreenville Pharmacy, Inc., 212 S.C. 485, 48 S.E.2d 324 (1948) (violation of\r\nstatute, while negligence per se, does not support recovery of damages\r\nbecause violation was not proximate cause of injury); Steele v. Rogers,\r\n306 S.C. 546, 413 S.E.2d 329 (Ct. App. 1992) (sale of alcoholic beverages to\r\nminor does not render vendor strictly liable for every ensuing act; even if sale\r\nconstitutes negligence per se, plaintiff must still show causal\r\nconnection between defendantâ€™s negligence and his own injury to recover\r\ndamages).\r\nIII\r\nParks argues the trial court erred\r\nby finding he is barred from recovery because he was voluntarily intoxicated and\r\nhis negligence exceeded that, if any, of the Bowdens.\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s doctrine of comparative negligence, a plaintiff\r\nmay recover damages only if his own negligence is not greater than that of the\r\ndefendant.&nbsp; Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 529 S.E.2d 710\r\n(2000).&nbsp; Ordinarily, comparison of the plaintiffâ€™s negligence with that\r\nof the defendant is a question of fact for the jury to decide.&nbsp; Id.\r\n&nbsp;In a comparative negligence case, the trial court should determine\r\njudgment as a matter of law only if the sole reasonable inference that may be\r\ndrawn from the evidence is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty\r\npercent.&nbsp; Id.\r\nComparative negligence principles\r\nare applicable in the social host liability setting. &nbsp;Finding a social host\r\nnegligent per se for serving alcohol to a minor and finding the social\r\nhost may be liable for injuries proximately resulting from the minorâ€™s\r\nintoxication does not end the inquiry. There still exists the factor that the\r\nminor plaintiff was not simply an unwitting third party to the actorâ€™s\r\nnegligence.&nbsp; Congini by Congini v. Portersville Valve Co., 470 A.2d\r\n515, 518 (Penn. 1983).&nbsp;\r\nAlthough â€œan eighteen-year-old minor may state a cause of action against an\r\nadult social host who has knowingly served him intoxicants, the social host in\r\nturn may assert as a defense the minorâ€™s [comparative] negligence.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nSee also Batten by Batten v. Bobo, 528 A.2d 572 (N.J. Super. 1986)\r\n(intoxicated minor guestâ€™s comparative negligence can properly be considered\r\nby jury in action against social host who provided cause of intoxication).\r\nIn the instant case, the trial court\r\nfound, as a matter of law, that Parksâ€™ comparative negligence outweighed the\r\nBowdensâ€™ alleged negligence.&nbsp; He based this ruling on the facts that\r\nParks was â€œvoluntarily intoxicatedâ€ and that the Bowdens were not aware that\r\nParks was underage.&nbsp; We disagree with these findings.&nbsp; A jury should\r\ndecide the comparative negligence of the parties because there is conflicting\r\nevidence.&nbsp; See Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc.,\r\nsupra (summary judgment appropriate only if no genuine issue of material\r\nfact); Bloom v. Ravoira, supra (in comparative negligence case,\r\ntrial court should determine judgment as matter of law only if sole reasonable\r\ninference which may be drawn from evidence is that plaintiffâ€™s negligence\r\nexceeded fifty percent).\r\nWe take this opportunity to\r\ndistinguish our decision in Lydia v. Horton, 355 S.C. 36, 583 S.E.2d 750\r\n(2003).&nbsp; In Lydia,\r\nwe held an intoxicated adult plaintiff (Lydia)\r\ncould not recover on a first-party negligent entrustment cause of action against\r\nanother adult (Horton) who had allowed Lydia  to drive his car.&nbsp; We stated Lydiaâ€™s\r\nadmission that he was â€œappreciably impairedâ€ and that he lost control of the\r\nvehicle supported only one conclusion, that Lydiaâ€™s negligence exceeded Hortonâ€™s.\r\nThe trial court relied on Lydia  in the instant\r\ncase and stated the only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that\r\nParksâ€™ negligence exceeded that of the Bowdens due to Parksâ€™ admission he\r\nwas intoxicated and that he later â€œgot into his car and drove away in a highly\r\nintoxicated state.â€\r\nWe find\r\nthe instant case distinguishable from Lydia.&nbsp; Parks\r\nwas underage at the time of the accident and our General Assembly has deemed\r\nthose persons less than twenty-one years of age to be incompetent to make\r\ndecisions regarding the consumption of alcohol.&nbsp; Unlike the situation in Lydia, it is possible\r\nthat a social host could be more than fifty percent negligent when an underage\r\nguest has become intoxicated and subsequently injures himself.&nbsp; Therefore,\r\nwe reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding that Parks is barred from recovery based\r\non comparative negligence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not err\r\nby finding Parks, as a nineteen-year-old, possessed full social and civil\r\nrights.&nbsp; However, although Parks was an adult for other purposes, he was\r\nconsidered a minor under the alcoholic beverage statutes.&nbsp; We further find\r\nthat a social host is subject to liability when that host has provided alcohol\r\nto an underage person who is subsequently injured or dies as a result of being\r\nprovided that alcohol.&nbsp; Finally, we find comparative negligence principles\r\napplicable in the social host setting.&nbsp; Therefore, the decision of the\r\ntrial court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER BURNETT and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]When referring to appellant, the name â€œParksâ€ will be used.\r\n[2]Mrs. Bowden testified in her deposition that when she read about\r\nParksâ€™ death in the paper, Mr. Bowden told her it could not be the Parks that\r\nhad attended the party because he was sure Parks was older than 19 years of age.\r\n[3]Mr. Hensley had heard Parks would drink excessively and then drive,\r\neven though other people would try to take his keys away from him.&nbsp; Parksâ€™\r\nroommate and the roommateâ€™s brother confirmed Parks drank excessively and\r\nwould drive drunk.&nbsp; The roommate stated he would often have to argue with\r\nParks to get the keys from him and that, one time, he had tackled Parks to the\r\nground for the keys.\r\n[4]The Court of Appeals, however, has found a question of negligence\r\nwas presented where an adult, as a fraternity pledge, was pressured to consume\r\nexcessive amounts of alcohol by the fraternity.&nbsp; Ballou v. Sigma Nu\r\nGeneral Fraternity, 291 S.C. 140, 352 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1986).&nbsp; The Ballou\r\ncase was distinguishable from Garren on the basis Ballou was pressured to\r\nconsume an excessive amount of alcohol and he was abandoned after being found\r\nunconscious and unresponsive.\r\n[5]S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-6-4070 (Supp. 2004) is the statute dealing\r\nwith the transfer of alcoholic liquors to a person under the age of\r\ntwenty-one years.&nbsp; The wording of the statute is the same as Â§ 61-4-90.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26036","title":"Barnes v.

Heyward Clarkson, III,\r\n        Charles F. Turner, Jr., and Sean A. Scoopmire, all of Clarkson, Walsh,\r\n        Rheney &amp; Turner, PA, of Greenville, for Petitioner.\r\n        George J. Kefalos, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; We\r\ngranted certiorari to consider a Court of Appealsâ€™ decision imposing liability\r\non a social host for damages to an individual killed when a nineteen-year-old\r\nguest who had consumed alcohol provided by the host caused an automobile\r\naccident.&nbsp; Barnes v.\r\nCohen Dry Wall, Inc., 357 S.C. 280, 592 S.E.2d 311 (Ct. App. 2003).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe sole issue is whether we will impose third party liability on a social host\r\nwho knowingly and intentionally serves alcohol to guests aged eighteen,\r\nnineteen, and twenty, that is, persons who are minors for purposes of alcoholic\r\nbeverage control laws.&nbsp; Following our decision to impose first party\r\nliability on social hosts under these circumstances, see Marcum v.\r\nBowden, Op. No. 26035 (S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\nfiled August 29, 2005) Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 34, we affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOrin Feagin was a nineteen-year-old\r\nemployee of petitioner Cohen Dry Wall, Inc. (Company) when he attended the\r\nCompanyâ€™s 1998 Christmas party.&nbsp; There was evidence that, despite Companyâ€™s\r\npre-party warning that Feagin would not be served at the party and its attempt\r\nto enforce this decision at the party, Feagin in fact consumed Company-supplied\r\nalcohol while there.&nbsp; Although Feagin exited the party with a group of\r\npeople including a designated driver, he drove himself to his girlfriendâ€™s\r\nplace of employment, then drove to his girlfriendâ€™s motherâ€™s home, and\r\nfinally returned to visit his girlfriend.&nbsp; After leaving his girlfriendâ€™s\r\nwork for the second time Feagin was involved in a two-car accident, which killed\r\nhim and the passenger in the other car.\r\nThe passengerâ€™s personal\r\nrepresentative (Respondent) sued both Company and Feaginâ€™s estate, and the\r\nestate cross-claimed against Company alleging negligence per se\r\nand gross negligence.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict for Company on this\r\ncross-claim.&nbsp; The jury returned a $750,000 verdict for actual damages\r\nagainst Company and Feaginâ€™s estate, finding Company 20% responsible and\r\nFeagin 80% responsible.[1]&nbsp; On\r\nCompanyâ€™s post-trial motion, the judge ordered an off-set against the verdict\r\nto the extent of Feaginâ€™s liability insurance.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals held\r\nthat the purpose of statutes[2]\r\nprohibiting a social host from serving alcohol to persons under 21 is to prevent\r\nharm to the minor, and to the members of the public harmed by the minorâ€™s\r\nalcohol consumption.&nbsp; Barnes v. Cohen Dry Wall, Inc., supra.&nbsp;\r\nWe affirm.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Whether the Court of Appeals erred\r\n  in finding that social hosts who knowingly and intentionally serve alcoholic\r\n  beverages to a guest aged eighteen to twenty owe a duty to a third party\r\n  injured or killed by the guest in an alcohol-related accident?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn Marcum v. Bowden, supra,\r\nwe held that social hosts may be liable to a guest under twenty-one who suffered\r\nan alcohol-related injury or death after consuming alcoholic beverages knowingly\r\nand intentionally provided by the host.&nbsp; We based our decision both on our\r\nconclusion that S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 61-4-90 and -4070 (Supp. 2004) create a\r\nprivate cause of action in favor of such a guest, and on public policy\r\ngrounds.&nbsp; We find the same considerations compel our decision today to\r\nextend liability to third parties.\r\nIn Whitlaw v. Kroger, 306\r\nS.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251 (1991), we held that the purpose of alcoholic beverage\r\ncontrol statutes prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons under\r\nthe age of twenty-one was to protect persons harmed by the minors who consumed\r\nthe alcohol, as well as the minors themselves.&nbsp; In Marcum v. Bowden,\r\nwe held that the statutes prohibiting the transfer or giving of alcoholic\r\nbeverages to minors were enacted for the benefit of those minors.&nbsp; We hold\r\ntoday that&nbsp; Â§Â§ 61-4-90 and -4070 were also enacted for the protection\r\nof members of the public from harm done by persons under twenty-one who have\r\nconsumed alcohol in violation of the statutes. [3]&nbsp;\r\nIn South\r\nCarolina, persons under twenty-one â€œare incompetent by reason of their youth\r\nand inexperience to deal responsibly with the effects of alcohol.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Imposing liability on social hosts encourages them\r\nto â€œbe more vigilant about who is consuming alcohol at their social\r\ngatherings,â€ Id., and thus promotes our public policy which prohibits the\r\nuse of alcohol by incompetent and inexperienced youth.&nbsp; We find that this\r\npolicy is served by the extension of social host liability to third parties\r\ninjured or killed in an alcohol-related accident by a guest under twenty-one\r\nyears of age who has consumed alcohol knowingly and intentionally provided to\r\nhim by the host.&nbsp; Before the injured person can recover damages from the\r\nsocial host, he must present evidence not only that the host knowingly and\r\nintentionally provided the minor with alcoholic beverages, but must also\r\nestablish a causal connection between the alcohol consumption and his injuries.&nbsp;\r\nMarcum v. Bowden, supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals\r\nholding that a social host may be liable to a third party injured by an underage\r\nguest who has consumed alcohol provided by the host is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, BURNETT,\r\nJJ., and Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The jury also awarded Respondent $1.4 million in punitive damages\r\nagainst Feaginâ€™s estate only.&nbsp; Neither this award nor the cross-claim are\r\nchallenged on appeal or certiorari.\r\n[2] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 61-4-90 and 61-4-4070 (Supp. 2004).\r\n[3] It would be unusual at best were we to find that the young person\r\nwho consumed the beverages could maintain a suit against the host but deny\r\nrelief to an innocent third party harmed by that minor.&nbsp; Cf., Tobias\r\nv. Sports Club Inc., 332 S.C. 90, 504 S.E.2d 318 (1998) (statutes\r\nprohibiting sale of alcohol by tavern owner to intoxicated person create third\r\nparty but not first party liability).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Jeffrey T.
