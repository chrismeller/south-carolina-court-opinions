The lease\r\n  required Harris Teeter to pay base rent to the property owner in the amount of\r\n  $14,074 a month, or $176,448 annually, as well as percentage rent if Harris Teeter's\r\n  net sales exceeded $16,400,000 annually.Â  The 1979 lease was considered an\r\n  under-market lease and thus favorable to Harris Teeter.Â Â  \r\n\r\nÂ  In 2001, East Bay Venture, LLC (EBV)\r\n  purchased the property and became Harris Teeter's landlord.Â  A dispute over lease\r\n  terms promptly surfaced involving the following lease provisions, which\r\n  required Harris Teeter to:Â  (1) insure the property for its &quot;insurable\r\n  value&quot; with responsible insurance companies authorized to do business in\r\n  South Carolina and (2) pay &quot;all costs and expenses of every kind and\r\n  nature whatsoever relating to the demised premises . . . except rent\r\n  interruption insurance, which shall be carried by the Landlord.&quot;\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter acquiring the property, Marcus\r\n  Durlach, III, acting on behalf of EBV, met with officers from Harris Teeter\r\n  regarding these lease provisions, specifically Harris Teeter's responsibility,\r\n  if any, for certain insurance and environmental costs associated with EBV's\r\n  purchase of the property.Â  Following the meeting, Harris Teeter contacted an\r\n  attorney in North Carolina it used for lease matters.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOver the next year, Durlach attempted to\r\n  contact Harris Teeter numerous times on behalf of EBV seeking reimbursement for\r\n  the expenses, but Durlach's communications were largely ignored.Â  Durlach eventually\r\n  wrote Harris Teeter on November 11, 2002, formally demanding reimbursement for\r\n  the costs.Â  Harris Teeter forwarded the letter to its North Carolina attorney,\r\n  but Harris Teeter did not respond to EBV's demand.Â \r\n  \r\nOn December 3, 2002, Durlach sent Harris\r\n  Teeter a letter declaring it in default under the lease.[1]Â \r\n  In response to this letter, Harris Teeter immediately retained a South Carolina law firm.Â  This law firm advised Harris Teeter that it was not responsible\r\n  for the disputed expenses and sent a letter to that effect to Durlach on\r\n  December 30, 2002.Â  During the cure period, however, no effort was made to cure\r\n  any alleged default by, for example, paying the disputed expenses under\r\n  protest.Â  Durlach responded by terminating the lease on January 9, 2003.[2]\r\n  \r\n  \r\nB.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing termination of the lease, Harris\r\n  Teeter discharged that law firm and retained its third law firm, Respondents.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondents undertook efforts to rescind\r\n  the lease termination; however, EBV's stance in negotiations was firm. Â EBV was\r\n  unwilling to rescind the lease termination without concessions, most notably a\r\n  substantial increase in base rent.Â  Harris Teeter maintained the position\r\n  throughout that EBV's posture was merely a pretext for EBV's desire to\r\n  renegotiate the lease terms with Harris Teeterâ€”for an increase in rent to\r\n  reflect what EBV believed to be the true market value of the lease. Harris\r\n  Teeter rejected EBV's April 28, 2003, offer of an increase to $300,000 in\r\n  annual base rent.\r\n  \r\n  On May 13, 2003, Harris Teeter, through Respondents,\r\n    paid EBV the disputed expenses under protest &quot;reserving all rights for\r\n    reimbursement as determined in the arbitration proceeding under the\r\n    Lease.&quot;Â  Respondents continued negotiations with EBV, but EBV refused to\r\n    rescind the lease termination absent a substantial increase in the base rent.Â \r\n    On June 20, 2003, EBV made its final offer: a new fifteen-year lease, with an\r\n    annual base rent of $475,000 for the first five years, $500,000 annually for\r\n    the second five-year period, and $625,000 annually for the final five-year\r\n    period.Â  Keith Rudemiller, Harris Teeter's vice president for real estate,\r\n    forwarded EBV's offer to Harris Teeter president Fred Morganthall.Â  In a\r\n    handwritten note accompanying the EBV offer, Rudemiller declared the offer\r\n    &quot;RIDICULOUS.&quot;Â  Harris Teeter rejected the offer. \r\n  C. \r\n  The dispute proceeded to arbitration.Â  Respondent\r\n    Howell Morrison of Moore &amp; Van Allen represented Harris Teeter at the\r\n    arbitration.Â  The parties agreed to select Lanneau Lambert as the arbitrator.Â \r\n    There were two issues before the arbitrator.Â  The first issue was whether\r\n    Harris Teeter defaulted under the lease by failing to reimburse EBV for the\r\n    costs associated in complying with the terms of the voluntary cleanup contract\r\n    (VCC)[3] and obtaining flood\r\n    insurance to cover Harris Teeter's $250,000 deductible.Â  If the arbitrator\r\n    answered this question in the affirmative, the second inquiry was whether the\r\n    breach was material.Â  The arbitrator rejected Harris Teeter's legal position\r\n    and determined Harris Teeter had breached the lease and that the breach was\r\n    material, thus terminating the lease.\r\n  Harris Teeter fired Respondents and hired another law\r\n    firm to file a motion for reconsideration.Â  While the reconsideration motion was pending, Harris Teeter and\r\n    EBV settled the matter by agreeing to new lease terms, most notably a\r\n    substantial increase in rent.\r\n  D. \r\n  Thereafter, Harris Teeter filed a complaint against\r\n    Respondents, alleging causes of action for professional negligence, breach of\r\n    contract, and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  The circuit court granted summary\r\n    judgment in favor of Respondents with respect to all claims, only three of\r\n    which Harris Teeter has pursued on appeal: the claims that Respondents\r\n    committed malpractice by failing to (1) introduce any evidence in regards to\r\n    two Kiriakides[4] factors; (2) advise Harris Teeter of the risk of lease termination; and (3)\r\n    settle the case prior to arbitration.[5]Â Â  \r\n  III.\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  In order to prevail in a cause of action for legal\r\n    malpractice, the plaintiff must prove:Â  (1) the existence of an attorney-client\r\n    relationship; (2) a breach of duty by the attorney; (3) damage to the client;\r\n    and (4) proximate cause of the client's damages by the breach.Â  Rydde v.\r\n      Morris, 381 S.C. 643, 646, 675 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2009).Â  &quot;In South\r\n    Carolina, attorneys are required to render services with the degree of skill,\r\n    care, knowledge, and judgment usually possessed and exercised by members of the\r\n    profession,&quot;Â  Holy Loch Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20,\r\n    26, 531 S.E.2d 282, 285 (2000), and &quot;[t]he standard to be applied in\r\n    determining legal malpractice issues is statewide,&quot; Smith v.\r\n      Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 437-38, 472 S.E.2d\r\n    612, 614 (1996).Â  Finally, generally, a plaintiff in a legal malpractice action\r\n    must establish this standard of care by expert testimony.Â  Id. at 435,\r\n    472 S.E.2d at 613.Â  \r\n  A.\r\n  We summarily dispose of two of Harris Teeter's claims:\r\n    (1) Respondents failed to advise Harris Teeter of the risk of lease\r\n    termination; and (2) Respondents failed to settle the case prior to\r\n    arbitration.\r\n  (1) Respondents\r\n    failed to advise Harris Teeter of the risk of lease termination\r\n  The record flatly refutes any suggestion that\r\n    Respondents failed to advise Harris Teeter of the risk of lease termination.Â \r\n    On the contrary, the record demonstrates that Respondents provided Harris\r\n    Teeter a candid assessment of the risk and consequences of lease termination. \r\n  On May 8, 2003, Respondents informed Julia Passmore,\r\n    Harris Teeter's leased property manager, that Harris Teeter's legal position\r\n    was not necessarily a &quot;slam dunk.&quot;Â  Respondents wanted to know if\r\n    Harris Teeter was comfortable with the risk of &quot;dispossession from the\r\n    property.&quot;Â  Respondents further warned Passmore &quot;about the whims of\r\n    arbitratorsâ€”and the consequences of termination.&quot;Â  In Passmore's\r\n    deposition, she acknowledged that Respondents were emphasizing &quot;[t]hat we\r\n    could lose the lease.&quot;\r\n  When Respondents candidly advised Harris Teeter of the\r\n    realities of litigation and the prospect of losing the lease, Passmore accused\r\n    Respondents of &quot;sound[ing] wishey washey&quot; in a May 14, 2003, email.Â \r\n    There is no evidence to suggest Respondents failed to advise Harris Teeter of\r\n    the risk of lease termination; instead, the record demonstrates precisely the\r\n    opposite.Â  In any event, the lease had been terminated by EBV before\r\n    Respondents' representation of Harris Teeter.Â  \r\n  (2)Â  Respondents\r\n    failed to settle the case prior to arbitration\r\n  The record also negates Harris Teeter's claim that\r\n    Respondents failed to settle the case prior to arbitration.Â  Instead, the\r\n    record shows that Harris Teeter had no interest in settling.Â  For example,\r\n    Respondents provided Passmore a copy of the Kiriakides opinion.Â \r\n    Passmore forwarded the Kiriakides opinion to Rudemiller.Â  Passmore's\r\n    handwritten note to Rudemiller stated &quot;[t]his is a S.C. Supreme Court Case\r\n    that our attorneys think is relevant in our East Bay situation.&quot;Â  And,\r\n    when, prior to arbitration, Respondents relayed EBV's final settlement offer to\r\n    Harris Teeter's Rudemiller, he declared the offer &quot;RIDICULOUS.&quot;Â  \r\n  Furthermore, even Harris Teeter's primary expert, Mark\r\n    Levick, opined that Harris Teeter's legal position was strong and the dispute\r\n    should have proceeded to arbitration. The suggestion that there is evidence of\r\n    malpractice for failing to settle the case prior to arbitration borders on\r\n    frivolity. \r\n  (3)Â  Kiriakides\r\n  We turn to Harris Teeter's remaining claim that\r\n    Respondents committed malpractice by failing to introduce any evidence in\r\n    regards to two of the Kiriakides factors.Â  Kiriakides, 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364.Â  Kiriakides is the controlling case in\r\n    South Carolina for determining whether a tenant materially breached the terms\r\n    of his lease agreement with a landlord so as to justify termination of the\r\n    lease.\r\n  In Kiriakides, we held, &quot;a lease may not\r\n    be forfeited for a trivial or technical breach even when the parties have\r\n    specifically agreed that 'any breach' gives rise to the right of\r\n    termination.&quot;Â  Id. at 275, 440 S.E.2d at 366.Â  Instead, we stated,\r\n    &quot;to justify forfeiture, the breach must be material, serious, or\r\n    substantial.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â  In order to determine whether the breach was\r\n    material, we announced the following five factor test: \r\n  \r\n\t(a) Â the extent to which the injured\r\n    party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;\r\n\t(b) the extent to which the injured party can be\r\n    adequately compensated [by damages] for the part of that benefit of which he\r\n    will be deprived;\r\n\t(c) Â the extent to which the party\r\n    failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;\r\n\t(d) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or\r\n    to offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the\r\n    circumstances including any reasonable assurances;\r\n\t(e) Â the extent to which the behavior\r\n    of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards\r\n    of good faith and fair dealing.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  Id. at 276,\r\n    440 S.E.2d at 366-67 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 241 (1981)).Â  \r\n  Harris Teeter argues Respondents breached their\r\n    standard of care by failing to present evidence with regards to the following\r\n    two Kiriakides factors: (1) the extent to which the injured party will\r\n    be deprived of the benefit he reasonably expected; and (2) the extent to which\r\n    the party failing to perform or offer to perform will suffer forfeiture.Â  Id.,\r\n    440 S.E.2d at 366.Â  We disagree.\r\n  The case proceeded to arbitration after Harris Teeter\r\n    rejected EBV's final settlement proposal.Â  In preparing for arbitration,\r\n    Respondents submitted a pre-hearing memorandum to the arbitrator.Â  In the\r\n    memorandum, Respondents focused on whether Harris Teeter actually breached the\r\n    lease, Durlach's motives for asserting a breach, and the materiality of any\r\n    supposed breach.Â  Respondents then cited to Kiriakides, the applicable\r\n    case law, to support their argument:\r\n  \r\n\tApplicable South Carolina law\r\n  is set forth in the case of Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications,\r\n  Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  (Copy attached) This\r\n  state's supreme court held therein that a landlord's right to terminate a\r\n  commercial leasehold is not unlimited and that termination must be tempered by\r\n  notions of equity and common sense.Â  The court found that, before a commercial\r\n  landlord may evict, the default of the lease agreement must be material.Â \r\n  &quot;[W]e hold that a forfeiture for a trivial or immaterial breach of a commercial\r\n  lease should not be enforced.&quot; Id. at 366.Â  The Kiriakides court\r\n  looked at the following factors:\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t(i) \r\n\t\t\t\t&nbsp;the extent to which the injured party \r\n\t\t\t\twill be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t(ii)\r\n\t\t\t\tthe extent to which the injured party can be \r\n\t\t\t\tadequately compensated by damages for the part of that benefit \r\n\t\t\t\tof which he will be deprived;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t(iii)&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\tthe extent to which the party failing to \r\n\t\t\t\tperform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t(iv) \r\n\t\t\t\tthe likelihood that the party \r\n\t\t\t\tfailing to perform or to offer to perform will cure his failure, \r\n\t\t\t\ttaking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable \r\n\t\t\t\tassurances; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t(v) \r\n\t\t\t\tthe extent to which the behavior of the party \r\n\t\t\t\tfailing to perform or to offer to perform comports with \r\n\t\t\t\tstandards of good faith dealing.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\tHarris Teeter submits that the evidence as to each of\r\n  these considerations weighs heavily in its favor and against the harsh remedy\r\n  of termination.\r\n\t\r\n\tHarris Teeter comes to this\r\n  proceeding having dealt in good faith and with clean hands.Â  As such, it seeks\r\n  equity from the Arbitrator as supported by the decision in Kiriakides.Â \r\n  It has been forced to expend considerable amounts in attorneys' fees, which it\r\n  will never recover.Â  It does, however, seek return of monies, plus interest,\r\n  that it has paid in protest to Landlord.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondents presented Kiriakides to\r\n  the arbitrator, but made a tactical decision to focus on the materiality of the\r\n  breach and not the precise extent of the cost of lease forfeiture to Harris\r\n  Teeter.[6]Â  Additionally,\r\n  Respondents presented evidence concerning the value of the lease to Harris\r\n  Teeter to the arbitrator and linked it to Durlach's motives for termination.Â \r\n  Respondents' argument to the arbitrator included the following:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\tThe issues that were the history of this situation,\r\n  Mr. Durlach seems to suggest that he was given a corporate brush-off and not\r\n  paid enough attention to, or something.Â  I think the testimony is that Harris\r\n  Teeter is a very responsible corporate operation and responsive corporate\r\n  operation.Â  They communicated a number of different ways through a number of\r\n  different people with their landlord.Â  And that this effort -- I think the\r\n  totality of this situation suggests that this effort to terminate is as much about\r\n  this low market lease as it is about anything to do with alleged breaches.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\tOf course Mr. Durlach would like to bring Harris\r\n  Teeter back to the table, when it has renewal options until 2025, to\r\n  renegotiate what he would like to say is a market lease with the gun pointed at\r\n  our head of termination otherwise.Â  I mean, wouldn't anybody want to in that\r\n  negotiating position?\r\n\t\r\n\t***\r\n\t\r\n\tSo what we have now, we believe, is an effort by the\r\n  landlord to take nonbreaches or -- or fairly debatable misunderstandings,\r\n  differences of opinion about application, at best, applicable to him,\r\n  application of ambiguous portions of this lease and to convert those to a\r\n  reason to terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAnd the law -- finally, the law is pretty clear in\r\n  South Carolina since the Kiriakides case came down, South Carolina has\r\n  made a clear decision since 1994 to join the majority of states who do not --\r\n  which do not permit a forfeiture of a leasehold interest for an immaterial\r\n  breach of a commercial lease.Â  The law is very clear now that -- as it is in\r\n  most states, that a breach must be material.\r\n  \t\r\n\tIn some cases materiality is described just exactly as\r\n  I described it a little while ago.Â  The material expectation of a landlord in a\r\n  lease agreement is to get his rent and to - you know, in many states in these\r\n  cases that talk about this law, they cite the equitable principle.Â  Since South\r\n  Carolina now imposes an equitable obligation on the trier of the fact, they\r\n  cite the equitable principle that the law abhors a forfeiture; equity does abhor\r\n  a forfeiture.Â  There's no question about that under the law.\r\n\t\r\n\tThere is a federal case law in the Fourth Circuit that\r\n  says in the liberally related rule of contracts that the law abhors a\r\n  forfeiture and that, quote, contractual provisions for forfeiture are looked\r\n  upon with disfavor by the Courts, Galvin against Southern Hotels.Â  It's an old\r\n  principle, but it's new law in South Carolina that commercial leases are now\r\n  imbued with principles of equity.Â  This -- it's relativeÂ Â  -- it's nine years\r\n  old, but it's clearly the law . . .\r\n  \t\r\n\tAnd so we just ask you to do what you already know how\r\n  to do, is to read a contract.Â  You don't need me to tell you how to do that,\r\n  but they can't always be read literally to the exclusion of all other\r\n  concerns.Â  They very seldom can.Â  This one cannot.Â  And we think that's what\r\n  the landlord has done and we think it's for the sole purpose of getting us into\r\n  a very vulnerable defensive position to renegotiate the contract, pure and\r\n  simple.Â  That's what we think it's about.Â  And if we breached or we're in\r\n  default, I believe it was immaterial, I submit it was immaterial, from\r\n  immaterial matters, not going to the heart of the contract and not grounds for\r\n  termination.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough Respondents elected to emphasize\r\n  the materiality of the breach, the record contains no support for Harris\r\n  Teeter's contention that no evidence was presented as to the two disputed Kiriakides factors.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  B.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Proximate Cause\r\n  \r\n  \r\nEven if Harris Teeter had produced a\r\n  scintilla of evidence that Respondents breached the standard of care by not\r\n  fully presenting all of the Kiriakides factors to the arbitrator, Harris\r\n  Teeter's claim would fail for lack of proximate cause.Â  The claim fails for\r\n  lack of proximate cause because, regardless of the source of the arbitrator's\r\n  knowledge, he was fully aware of the Kiriakides decision.Â  In his\r\n  written ruling, the arbitrator cited and considered all Kiriakides factors.Â  Of particular concern to Harris Teeter was the factor dealing with\r\n  &quot;the extent to which a party failing to perform will suffer\r\n  forfeiture.&quot;Â  The following excerpt from the arbitrator's decision lays to\r\n  rest any suggestion that he failed to consider the consequences of lease\r\n  forfeiture:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\tWhile the Arbitrator is ever mindful that\r\n  termination and forfeiture of the Lease is a drastic remedy and must be\r\n  tempered by notions of equity and common sense, Harris Teeter's pattern of\r\n  behavior and the resulting non-payment of sums owed under the Lease until the\r\n  Lease was terminated justify EBV's actions.Â  The numerous opportunities presented\r\n  to Harris Teeter to timely address EBV's concerns and to cure its failure to\r\n  pay sums due to Landlord under the Lease prior to termination (or to timely pay\r\n  such sums in protest) simply cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n(Emphasis added).[7]Â \r\n  Thus, any alleged failure by Respondents to present all Kiriakides factors was not the proximate cause of Harris Teeter's loss.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  C.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nHarris Teeter relied on the deposition\r\n  testimony of two experts, Levick and Charles Scarminach, to defeat summary\r\n  judgment.Â  Even if we were to accept Harris Teeter's argument that Levick and\r\n  Scarminach were qualified to render an expert opinion, we agree with the trial\r\n  court that their deposition testimony failed to present evidence of a breach of\r\n  the standard of care or a genuine issue of material fact regarding proximate\r\n  cause.Â  Harris Teeter apparently recognized the clear insufficiency of the\r\n  Scarminach and Levick testimony, for it submitted post-deposition affidavits in\r\n  an attempt to rescue its malpractice claims.Â  The trial court properly\r\n  characterized these post-deposition affidavits as &quot;sham&quot; affidavits. See Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 218, 592 S.E.2d 629, 633 (2004) (setting forth six considerations a court may\r\n  use to determine if a post-deposition affidavit is a &quot;sham\r\n  affidavit&quot;).Â \r\n  \r\n  Scarminach concluded that the Respondents had breached\r\n    the standard of careâ€”despite failing to establish the standard of care in his\r\n    deposition.Â  The correct standard of care is &quot;the\r\n    degree of skill, care, knowledge, and judgment usually possessed and exercised\r\n    by members of the profession.&quot;Â  Holy Loch Distribs., 340 S.C. at 26, 531 S.E.2d at 285.Â  Scarminach,\r\n    however, did not testify as to this standard.Â  Instead, when asked about the\r\n    definition of standard of care upon which he relied to form his opinion,\r\n    Scarminach replied, &quot;It's my standard.&quot;Â Â  He later clarified by stating that his\r\n    standard was that &quot;of someone reading\r\n    this at the end of the case,&quot; or &quot;that of a businessman's lawyer.&quot;Â  Neither of these additional statements\r\n    accurately presents the proper standard of care.Â  Thus, Scarminach's conclusory\r\n    statement that Respondents breached the standard of care does not create a\r\n    genuine issue of material fact.Â Â Â  \r\n  Furthermore, Scarminach did not testify that the\r\n    Respondents' action satisfied the causation in fact requirement of proximate\r\n    cause.Â  Oliver v. S.C. Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 309 S.C.\r\n    313, 316, 422 S.E.2d 128, 130 (1992) (stating that proximate cause requires\r\n    proof of causation in fact and legal cause); id. (stating that causation\r\n    in fact is proved by showing that plaintiff's injury would not have occurred &quot;but for&quot; defendant's negligence).Â  When asked if the case would have produced a\r\n    different outcome had the Respondents not breached their standard of care,\r\n    Scarminach hedged: &quot;you never know\r\n    because it's conjecture.&quot;Â  Instead of stating\r\n    that the Respondents' conduct most probably caused the outcome, Scarminach\r\n    said, &quot;had [Respondents] done these things, the\r\n    percentage of success would have been greater.&quot;Â \r\n    Thus, Scarminach's deposition did not establish that the Respondents' actions\r\n    were the &quot;but for&quot; cause of Harris Teeter's loss.Â  \r\n  \r\nLevick, on the other hand, testified the\r\n  standard of care is a determination of what a &quot;reasonably competent lawyer\r\n  [would] do given the facts and situations they were handed.&quot;Â  This generic\r\n  statement is true in the abstract, as it can be applied to any professional\r\n  negligence claim.Â  Yet this circular opinion, when combined with Levick's\r\n  deposition testimony, does not create a genuine issue of fact as to a breach of\r\n  the standard of care.Â  Levick's statement merely begs the question and adds\r\n  nothing to the analysis of the substantive legal malpractice claim.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLevick's deposition testimony reveals the\r\n  basis of this legal malpractice claimâ€”a bad result.Â  Levick was questioned\r\n  concerning the basis of his opinion of Respondents' malpractice.Â  Instead,\r\n  Levick embarked on an unsolicited and unfounded attack against the arbitrator\r\n  and his integrity.Â  Levick stated that if the arbitrator were &quot;fair, â€¦\r\n  there is not a way in the world that [he] could have come up with this\r\n  decision.&quot;Â  Levick further stated, &quot;I don't think [the arbitrator]\r\n  had a clue&quot; and &quot;what [Respondents] didn't communicate was who they\r\n  were dealing with as an arbitrator.&quot;\r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhen asked if Harris Teeter would have\r\n  &quot;won â€¦ before the arbitrator â€¦ if the case had been handled in some different\r\n  fashion[,]&quot; Levick acknowledged, &quot;Obviously, it's speculation.&quot;Â \r\n  We agree.Â  But Levick's &quot;speculation&quot; admission forms only part of\r\n  our reasoning for concluding that his testimony is not sufficient to survive\r\n  summary judgment.Â  Like the excellent trial judge, we have carefully reviewed\r\n  the entirety of Levick's testimony.Â  Levick speaks only in generalities when he\r\n  opines the case was not &quot;properly presented.&quot;Â  Levick's generalities\r\n  fall woefully short of our admissibility standards for experts in professional\r\n  negligence cases.Â  Therefore, we agree with the trial court that neither expert\r\n  presented evidence to help Harris Teeter survive Respondents' motion for\r\n  summary judgment.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  D.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nBecause Harris Teeter's malpractice claim seeks to\r\n  establish the element of a breach of the standard of care through the\r\n  arbitrator's adverse ruling, we address the relationship between a &quot;bad\r\n  result&quot; and a professional malpractice claim.Â  Harris Teeter lost in\r\n  arbitrationâ€”and that bad result forms the core of Harris Teeter's malpractice\r\n  allegation.Â  Of course, any professional negligence claim involves a bad\r\n  result. We reject as a matter of law any suggestion that a bad result is\r\n  evidence of the breach of the standard of care.Â  To do so would change the\r\n  landscape of our malpractice law, for all professionals.Â  We adhere to the\r\n  principle that the exercise of a professional's judgment (and accompanying acts\r\n  and omissions) must be considered at the time the professional service is\r\n  rendered and not through the lens of hindsight. Â Â \r\n  \r\n  In rejecting a hindsight analysis, the trial court\r\n    found Respondents' actions were protected under the judgmental immunity rule,\r\n    which has not been formally adopted in South Carolina.Â  The judgmental immunity\r\n    rule provides that &quot;there\r\n    can be no liability for acts and omissions by an attorney in the conduct of\r\n    litigation which are based on an honest exercise of professional\r\n    judgment.&quot; Woodruff v. Tomlin, 616 F.2d 924, 930 (6th Cir. 1980).Â  In\r\n    referring to the judgmental immunity rule as &quot;a sound rule,&quot; the Woodruff court observed that &quot;[o]therwise every losing litigant would be able to\r\n    sue his attorney if he could find another attorney who was willing to second\r\n    guess the decisions of the first attorney with the advantage of\r\n    hindsight.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In\r\n    assessing liability, a court should never measure a professional's performance\r\n    through the lens of hindsight.Â  Although an attorney may be liable for damages\r\n    to a client for failure to act with a reasonable degree of skill and care,\r\n    &quot;[t]his does not mean, however, that an attorney acts as an insurer of the\r\n    outcome of a case.&quot;Â  Crosby v. Jones, 705 So. 2d 1356, 1358 (Fla.\r\n    1998).\r\n  Respondents made an informed judgment in their approach\r\n    to the arbitration hearing.Â  Respondents made a tactical and strategic decision\r\n    to focus on whether Harris Teeter actually breached the lease and the\r\n    materiality of the alleged breach.Â  Respondents, specifically Howell Morrison,\r\n    made a tactical decision not to emphasize the precise value (in dollar terms)\r\n    of the under-market lease because the attorneys believed this could work to\r\n    Harris Teeter's detriment: &quot;In my judgment it would not have helped the\r\n    presentation of the case to emphasize the under market lease that Harris Teeter\r\n    heldâ€¦and in my view then, and still in my view, if we had spent time showing\r\n    the Arbitrator emphasizing that we had a submarket lease, it was very much a\r\n    two-edged sword that could have easily worked to our detriment.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\n  Morrison made a judgment call concerning the\r\n    presentation of the Kiriakides factorsâ€”a judgment call that was not\r\n    unreasonable as a matter of law.Â  Because the judgment call was reasonable as a\r\n    matter of law (and consequently no question of fact is presented), there is no\r\n    viable claim of malpractice.Â  Morrison's judgment call falls squarely in the\r\n    category of a &quot;professional\r\n    judgment made with reasonable care and skill.&quot;Â  Biomet Inc. v. Finnegan Henderson LLP, 967 A.2d 662, 666.\r\n  Although the judgmental immunity rule correctly\r\n    highlights the rejection of a hindsight analysis, Respondents' entitlement to\r\n    summary judgment does not depend on our adoption of the rule.Â  We therefore\r\n    leave the question of adoption of the judgmental immunity rule for another day.[8]\r\n  \r\n  \r\nE.\r\n\r\nThe practice of law is not an exact science.Â  The\r\n  practice of law involves the exercise of judgment based on the circumstances\r\n  known and reasonably ascertainable at the time the judgment is rendered.Â \r\n  &quot;[A] lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render\r\n  candid advice.&quot; Rule 2.1, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct are replete with the recognition that a lawyer cannot pursue every\r\n  issue that arises in a case while effectively representing his or her client.Â \r\n  To the contrary, the Rules recognize that in order to provide a client the best\r\n  and most competent representation, a lawyer has the professional discretion to\r\n  make a judgment call as to which legal theories are the strongest and will best\r\n  serve the client's interest.Â  See Rule 1.3, cmt. 1, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR\r\n  (&quot;A lawyer is not bound, however, to press for every advantage that might\r\n  be realized for a client. For example, a lawyer may have authority to exercise\r\n  professional discretion in determining the means by which a matter should be\r\n  pursued.&quot;); Hudson v. Windholz, 416 S.E.2d 120, 124 (Ga. 1992) (recognizing that &quot;the tactical decisions made during the course of litigation\r\n  require, by their nature, that the attorney be given a great deal of\r\n  discretion&quot;).\r\nIn retrospect, should Respondents have presented\r\n  precise financial data to the arbitrator concerning the substantial boon of the\r\n  under-market lease to Harris Teeter?Â  Perhaps.Â  But hindsight is not the\r\n  measuring stick.Â  A case can always be tried &quot;better.&quot;Â  Respondents\r\n  made a considered judgment to focus on the merits of the alleged breach and\r\n  particularly its materiality.Â  As noted, that judgment call was not\r\n  unreasonable as a matter of law.Â  And as the arbitrator acknowledged, lease\r\n  forfeiture was a &quot;drastic remedy,&quot; as all understood that EBV wanted\r\n  a new lease with market based rent and Harris Teeter wanted to preserve the\r\n  1979 lease.\r\nHere, Respondents candidly warned Harris Teeter of the\r\n  risk of lease termination, even to the point of Harris Teeter characterizing\r\n  Respondents' legal candor as &quot;wishey washey.&quot;Â  Harris Teeter's\r\n  flippant disregard of Respondents' candid warning mirrored its longstanding\r\n  disregard of EBV's inquiries and requests to honor the lease.Â  Harris Teeter\r\n  went into arbitration with its eyes wide open regarding the risk.Â  Respondents\r\n  exercised independent and reasonable professional judgment in choosing what they\r\n  deemed a proper strategy in representing Harris Teeter's interest before an\r\n  arbitrator highly skilled and knowledgeable in commercial real estate matters.Â \r\n  Because Respondents' judgment was not unreasonable as a matter of law, the\r\n  trial court properly dismissed this malpractice claim.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the grant of summary judgment to Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, J., and Acting Justice\r\n  James E. Moore, concur. HEARN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in\r\n  a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:Â Â Â Â Â  Respectfully, I concur in part and\r\n  dissent in part.Â Â  IÂ  fully concur in the majority opinion to the extent that\r\n  it affirms the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Respondents on the grounds they committed malpractice by failing to advise\r\n  Harris Teeter of the risk of lease termination and by failing to settle the\r\n  case before arbitration.Â  However, I part company with the majority and would\r\n  reverse the circuit court's grant of summary judgment as to Harris Teeter's\r\n  allegations that Respondents committed malpractice by failing to introduce any\r\n  evidence in regards to the two Kiriakides factors.Â  \r\nI.\r\nThe single issue presented is whether Harris Teeter\r\n  has presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment; I express no\r\n  opinion as to what the outcome of this case would be after a trial on the\r\n  merits.Â  Faithful to my understanding of the principles governing review of an\r\n  order granting summary judgment, as recently enunciated by this Court, my focus\r\n  is only on whether Harris Teeter has presented a mere scintilla of evidence in\r\n  support of its allegations of malpractice.Â  See Hancock v. Mid-S. Mgmt. Co.,\r\n  381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009) (&quot;[I]n cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion\r\n  for summary judgment.&quot;).Â  This standard requires merely &quot;the\r\n  slightest amount of relevant evidence&quot; on an issue to warrant denial of\r\n  summary judgment.Â  Black's Law Dictionary 635 (3d pocket ed. 2006).Â  If\r\n  this indeed is the standard, it must be applied in every case, including\r\n  attorney malpractice cases.\r\nAs the majority correctly recognizes, Kiriakides v.\r\n  United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994),\r\n  is the controlling case in South Carolina to determine whether a tenant\r\n  materially breached the terms of his lease agreement with a landlord so as to\r\n  justify termination of the lease.Â  In Kiriakides, we held, &quot;a lease\r\n  may not be forfeited for a trivial or technical breach even when the parties\r\n  have specifically agreed that 'any breach' gives rise to the right of\r\n  termination.&quot;Â  312 S.C. at 275, 440 S.E.2d at 366.Â  Instead, we stated, &quot;to\r\n  justify forfeiture, the breach must be material, serious, or substantial.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â  In order to determine whether the breach was material, we\r\n  announced the following five factor test: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(a)\r\n\t\t\tthe extent to which the injured\r\n  party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(b)\r\n\t\t\tthe extent to which the injured party can be\r\n  adequately compensated [by damages] for the part of that benefit of which he\r\n  will be deprived;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(c)\r\n\t\t\tthe extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform\r\n  will suffer forfeiture;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(d) \r\n\t\t\tthe likelihood that the party failing to perform or\r\n  to offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the\r\n  circumstances including any reasonable assurances;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(e) \r\n\t\t\tthe extent to which the behavior\r\n  of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards\r\n  of good faith and fair dealing.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  275-76, 440 S.E.2d at 366-67 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 241\r\n  (1981)).Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard of Care\r\nDuring Levick's deposition, he testified that\r\n  Respondents breached their standard of care by failing to introduce any\r\n  evidence during the arbitration in regards to the two Kiriakides factors.[9]Â  In his deposition,\r\n  Levick was asked, &quot;[w]as it incompetent to fail to put in the monetary\r\n  value of the lease to Harris Teeter?&quot;Â  Levick responded &quot;yes.&quot;Â \r\n  Additionally, Levick testified that Respondents' failure to introduce any\r\n  evidence during the arbitration concerning the value of Harris Teeter's current\r\n  leaseâ€”as Levick stated, &quot;not just to Harris Teeter, but the value to the\r\n  landlord when he bought it&quot;â€”was a &quot;key issue.&quot; At another point\r\n  in his deposition, Levick was asked, &quot;[g]iven the first Kiriakides factor\r\n  is the extent to which a party will be deprived o[f] [the] benefit[] reasonably\r\n  expected, was it incompetent to fail to specifically argue that factor was met\r\n  because Harris Teeter always paid their rent?&quot;Â  Again, Levick responded\r\n  &quot;yes.&quot;Â  Moreover, the following colloquy occurred during Levick's\r\n  deposition:\r\n\r\n\tQ:Â  Let's go down to [subpart] D [of Harris Teeter's\r\n  complaint against Respondents], failing to adequately prepare for the\r\n  arbitration.Â  Tell me specifically what was not done that you think in your\r\n  judgment should have done to prepare?\r\n\tA:Â  I would have had a tremendous amount of evidence\r\n  on the value of the lease to Harris Teeter.Â  I would have had a whole economic\r\n  evaluation of why the purchase price that was paid at the time that Durlach\r\n  bought it, why that price was fair and reasonable given the lease and what a\r\n  windfall the termination would produce.Â  I would have an appraiser's analysis\r\n  show the value of the property if the Harris [Teeter] lease wasn't in place . .\r\n  . .Â  And I don't recall that any of thatâ€”well, I didn't see that any of that was\r\n  presented.Â  In fact, I did see that there was a conscious decision to not show\r\n  the value of the lease to Harris Teeter . . . .Â  There was no evidence\r\n  submitted on any of this I can find.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe majority disregards Levick's testimony and concludes &quot;Respondents\r\n  presented Kiriakides front and center to the arbitrator.&quot;Â  This\r\n  finding is in direct conflict with the testimony of Howell Morrison, the\r\n  attorney representing Harris Teeter at arbitration.Â  During his deposition,\r\n  Morrison acknowledged he did not introduce any evidence in regards to the Kiriakides factors at issue.Â  In fact, Morrison testified that he made a conscious\r\n  decision not to introduce such evidence.Â  The relevant portions of Morrison's\r\n  testimony are quoted below.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\tQ:Â  Did you ever look at the effect of that long term\r\n  lease that was under market [value] on the price that Mr. [D]urlach paid for\r\n  the building?\r\n\tA:Â  I knew that it had a depressive market impact on\r\n  the market value for most buyers.Â  I assumed so.Â  It was common sense and obvious\r\n  to me.\r\n\tQ:Â  Did you get any evidence on that?Â  I don't see any\r\n  evidence in the record about that.\r\n\tA:Â  No.Â  I didn't see that as any primary issue in the\r\n  Arbitration.\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tQ:Â  The first criteria [sic] of the Kiriakides [case] is the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit\r\n  which he reasonably expected.Â  If you buy a building under value, depressed\r\n  because of the lease, you're expecting to get the lease that's on the\r\n  buildingâ€”the lease payments aren't you?\r\n\tA:Â  If you buy below market value or above market\r\n  value or at market value, you expect to get your lease.Â  Right.\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tQ:Â  I don't see anything in the record to show how\r\n  much money Mr. Durlach was going to [make in] windfall, not only in lease\r\n  payments, but in the value to his property by getting this lease out.Â  And that\r\n  was crucial to this case.Â  Why wouldn't you have [done] that?\r\n\tA:Â  It was not crucial.Â  In my judgment it would not\r\n  have helped the presentation of the case to emphasize the under market lease\r\n  that Harris Teeter held.Â  \r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tQ:Â  Is there any evidence in the record that would\r\n  show what the value wouldâ€”how the fair market value of the building would\r\n  appreciate or what rent he might get?\r\n\tA:Â  I did not specifically introduce evidence of that\r\n  type . . . .Â  And in my view then, and still in my view, if we had spent time\r\n  showing the Arbitrator emphasizing that we had a submarket lease, it was very\r\n  much a two-edged sword that could have easily worked to our detriment.Â  \r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tQ:Â  Did you put in one dollar figure at what it would\r\n  cost Harris Teeter?Â  \r\n\tA:Â  I don't think [so].Â  I made a decision not to do\r\n  that.\r\n\tQ:Â  . . . And did you have in the record, one dollar\r\n  figure at how this would impact Mr. Durlach in getting more money than he would\r\n  have expected when he bought the property?Â  \r\n\tA:Â  Well, what if he expected to find a way to\r\n  renegotiate the lease, number one?\r\n\tQ:Â  Did you show him [the arbitrator] how much money\r\n  he would make by doing that?\r\n\tA:Â  No.Â  I did not express total dollar figure either\r\n  way.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe majority relies exclusively on Respondents'\r\n  pre-hearing memorandum and comments made by Respondents during opening and\r\n  closing arguments to support its conclusion that Respondents fully presented Kiriakides to the arbitrator.[10]Â  As demonstrated by the\r\n  testimony set forth above, Morrison unequivocally conceded that he did not\r\n  introduce any evidence pertaining to the two Kiriakides factors in\r\n  question to the arbitrator.Â  Moreover, the statements relied on by the\r\n  majorityâ€”the pre-hearing memorandum and opening and closing remarksâ€”are merely\r\n  arguments of counsel and have long been recognized by this Court not to\r\n  constitute evidence.Â  See, e.g., Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C.\r\n  56, 64, 624 S.E.2d 649, 653 (2006).\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Proximate Cause\r\nIn order to demonstrate proximate cause, a plaintiff\r\n  must show he most probably would have been successful in the underlying suit if\r\n  the attorney had not committed the alleged malpractice.Â  Summer v. Carpenter,\r\n  328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997).Â  This Court in Baughman v.\r\n    American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. succinctly stated the &quot;most\r\n  probably&quot; rule as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIt is not sufficient for the expert . . . to testify\r\n  merely that the ailment might or could have resulted from the alleged cause. He\r\n  must go further and testify that taking into consideration all the data it is\r\n  his professional opinion that the result in question most probably came from\r\n  the cause alleged.Â  \r\n\r\n306 S.C. 101, 111, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991).Â  But, &quot;[i]n\r\n  determining whether particular evidence meets this test it is not necessary\r\n  that the expert actually use the words 'most probably.'&quot;Â  Id.\r\nTo survive summary judgment, the evidence presented must\r\n  amount to more than mere speculation and conjecture. McKnight v. S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Corrs., 385 S.C. 380, 390, 684 S.E.2d 566, 571 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  The\r\n  expert must therefore state this opinion with reasonable certainty. See\r\n    Ellis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 125, 473 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1996).Â  However,\r\n  in evaluating a motion for summary judgment, we must not weigh the credibility\r\n  of the witnesses and the testimony. Anderson v. The Augusta Chronicle,\r\n  355 S.C. 461, 475, 585 S.E.2d 506, 513 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, if the expert's testimony\r\n  facially meets these criteria, it will be sufficient to defeat summary\r\n  judgment.\r\n\r\n\tDuring his deposition, Levick testified as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMy opinion is had they gone step by step through the Kiriakides case, had they shown the extreme windfall for the landlord and the extreme\r\n  detriment to the tenant, had they shown the communications between the parties\r\n  in great depth orally, had they shown the intent of the original parties in its\r\n  entirety, had they shown what the law is in other jurisdictions, had they shown\r\n  custom and usage . . . there is not a way in the world that they could have\r\n  come up with this decision.Â  That is my opinion.Â  It could not have happened.Â Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThen, in another point in his deposition, the following colloquy\r\n  occurred: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tQ:Â  Is it your overall opinion that if this case\r\n  before the arbitrator had been handled in some different fashion, more\r\n  specifically in the way that you suggest, the case would have been won by\r\n  Harris Teeter before this arbitrator?\r\n\t\tA:Â  Obviously it's speculation, but in reading the\r\n  opinion, the only thing that I can gather is that the arbitrator believed that\r\n  Harris Teeter's conduct was so egregious that terminating a very valuable lease\r\n  was a remedy.Â  I don't think that the arbitrator had an inkling in assuming he\r\n  was the fair person that they thought they were hiring, had an inkling that\r\n  this was a landlord who Harris Teeter's lawyer believed was trying to set them\r\n  up for a lease termination, that basically was trying to get out of this lease\r\n  and was using the arbitrator as a way to do it.Â  I don't think he had a clue,\r\n  and I don't think he would have permitted himself to be used as a vehicle for\r\n  terminating a perfectly valid lease that had been in force for 21 years when\r\n  the guy bought it; that he bent backwards and forwards over it; that he\r\n  requested no changes when he bought it; that this all of a sudden would\r\n  translate into egregious bad faith that would deprive HT [sic] of the benefit\r\n  of a lease that they had honored for 21 years.Â  I just don't see him\r\n    coming to that decision if the case was presented properly.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nLevick's first statement clearly satisfies the most probably\r\n  requirement.Â  As a result, I would hold that Harris Teeter has presented sufficient\r\n  evidence to survive summary judgment with respect to its allegation that\r\n  Respondents committed malpractice by failing to introduce any evidence in\r\n  regards to the two Kiriakides factors. \r\nAdmittedly, Levick's second statement is more\r\n  problematic because he began by stating, &quot;[o]bviously it's speculation.&quot;Â \r\n  In the circuit court's view, Levick's introductory statement rendered his\r\n  entire opinion on the issue of proximate cause as nothing more than mere\r\n  conjecture or speculation.Â  I disagree with this interpretation of the\r\n  statement.Â  In reading Levick's second statement in context, I would find he\r\n  did not state his conclusionâ€”whether the result of the proceeding most probably\r\n  would have been differentâ€”was speculation.[11]Â  See Brockbank\r\n    v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 378-79, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000) (&quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in\r\n  the light most favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;).Â  Rather, in answering\r\n  the question, Levick began by speculating as to why the arbitrator\r\n  reached the conclusion he reached.Â  In doing so, he initially stated that such\r\n  telepathy is &quot;[o]bviously . . . speculation.&quot;Â  In explaining why be\r\n  believed the arbitrator terminated the lease, Levick surmised that the\r\n  arbitrator inexplicably and erroneously viewed Harris Teeter as the bad actor\r\n  in this case when in reality the landlord was the bad actor.Â  This\r\n  hypothesizing ended, however, when at the end of his answer Levick unequivocally\r\n  stated, &quot;I just don't see him coming to that decision if the case was\r\n  presented properly.&quot;\r\nIn Baughman, this Court stated expert testimony is\r\n  sufficient to establish proximate cause so long as the testimony is such &quot;as\r\n  to judicially impress&quot; that the opinion represents the expert's\r\n  professional judgment as to the most likely among possible outcomes.Â  306 S.C.\r\n  at 111, 410 S.E.2d at 543 (internal quotation omitted).Â  Mindful of Baughman and our standard of review, I would find Levick testified that the result of\r\n  the proceeding most probably would have been different if Respondents had not\r\n  breached their duty of care to Harris Teeter.[12]\r\nBased on our analysis, I would conclude that Levick's\r\n  deposition established the standard of care for attorneys; Respondents breached\r\n  that standard of care by failing to introduce any evidence in regards to the\r\n  two Kiriakides factors; and finally, that the result of the proceeding\r\n  most probably would have been different had Respondents not breached their duty\r\n  of care to Harris Teeter.\r\nC.&nbsp; Judgmental Immunity Rule\r\nI concur in the majority's decision to not adopt the\r\n  judgmental immunity rule at this time.Â  Under the judgmental immunity rule,\r\n  strategic decisions made by an attorney in good faith and in conformity with\r\n  the standard of care cannot be the basis of a legal malpractice claim.Â  Biomet\r\n    Inc. v. Finnegan Henderson LLP, 967\r\n      A.2d 662, 666 (D.C. 2009).Â  If Respondents did not breach their standard of\r\n  care as a matter of law, then an additional rule insulating them from liability\r\n  is unnecessary.Â  While I agree that we should not adopt this rule under the\r\n  facts before us, it would be my view that we should never adopt it.\r\nThe core of this rule is nothing more than a tautology; it\r\n  has always been clear that so long as an attorney exercises a reasonable degree\r\n  of skill and care he will not suffer liability.Â  Adopting a separate rule that\r\n  restates that cardinal principle of our malpractice jurisprudence and\r\n  denominates it an &quot;immunity&quot; certainly is de trop. See Sun\r\n    Valley Potatoes, Inc. v. Rosholt, Robertson &amp; Tucker, 133 Idaho 1, 5\r\n  (1999) (&quot;Rather than being a rule which grants some type of 'immunity' to\r\n  attorneys, it appears to be nothing more than a recognition that if an\r\n  attorney's actions could under no circumstances be held to be negligent, then a\r\n  court may rule as a matter of law that there is no liability.&quot;).Â Â  Indeed,\r\n  if this rule is in fact different from our general rules concerning attorney\r\n  malpractice, then it would inherently sanction some conduct that would\r\n  otherwise be negligent.Â  To the extent the judgmental immunity rule restates\r\n  the general rule that attorneys must comply with the standard of care, I would\r\n  not adopt it as it is superfluous; to the extent that it offers any more\r\n  protection to attorneys, I cannot join in the sanctioning of unprofessional and\r\n  negligent conduct under the guise of &quot;good faith&quot; and\r\n  &quot;professional judgment.&quot;\r\nII.\r\nEvery malpractice case is, by its very nature, &quot;Monday\r\n  morning quarter-backing,&quot; and I wholeheartedly agree with the majority' s\r\n  statement that &quot;[t]he practice of law is not an exact science.&quot;Â  I\r\n  also agree we grant attorneys a wide degree of discretion in how they prepare\r\n  and try their cases.Â  Indeed, clients are compensating attorneys for that very\r\n  exercise of discretion.Â  However, the issue of whether Respondents committed\r\n  legal malpractice is not before the Court; that question must wait for another\r\n  day.Â  Rather, today we are called upon to determine solely whether Harris\r\n  Teeter has met its burden in opposing summary judgment.Â  I would hold that\r\n  Harris Teeter adduced at least a mere scintilla of evidence sufficient to\r\n  survive summary judgment.Â  I want to reiterate that in so doing, I pass no\r\n  judgment on the merits of either side of this case or Levick's credibility.Â \r\n  Rather, I would faithfully adhere to the principles established by this Court\r\n  as to the role we play on review of summary judgment orders.Â  Accordingly, I\r\n  would reverse and remand for a trial on the merits of Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Harris Teeter's\r\n  claim regarding the two Kiriakides factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The lease explicitly provided that the tenant\r\n  had ten days to cure any monetary default and thirty days to cure any nonmonetary\r\n  default.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Harris Teeter also filed a malpractice claim\r\n  against the first South Carolina law firm; that firm settled the claim.\r\n[3]&nbsp; A VCC is a contract between the Department of\r\n  Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) and a nonresponsible party pledging to\r\n  clean up environmental contamination, enacted under the Brownfields/Voluntary\r\n  Cleanup Program, codified at South Carolina Code sections 44-56-710 through 760\r\n  (2002).Â  Under a VCC, the nonresponsible party agrees to clean up the contamination\r\n  in return for liability protection from DHEC.Â  \r\n[4] &nbsp;Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp; Harris Teeter has not appealed from the circuit\r\n  court's ruling with respect to the other claims against Respondents.Â \r\n  Therefore, the circuit court's ruling on those claims is the law of the case.Â  See Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 65, 624 S.E.2d 649, 653-54 (2006) (stating\r\n  an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).Â  \r\n[6]&nbsp; The East Bay store has been a financial boon for\r\n  Harris Teeter.Â  Harris Teeter has annual sales in excess of two billion\r\n  dollars, and the East Bay store has annual sales of twenty-four million\r\n  dollars.Â  Soon after EBV purchased the property and lease questions remained\r\n  unresolved, Harris Teeter inquired about the potential to acquire the\r\n  property.Â  As Passmore testified at the arbitration, &quot;Yes, I did make a\r\n  telephone call to Mr. Durlach at the request of the president of Harris Teeter\r\n  to ask Mr. Durlach if we could acquire the property.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\n[7]&nbsp; The\r\n  parenthetical regarding the payment of the disputed expenses &quot;in protest&quot;\r\n  lends Harris Teeter no support, for it was only after Harris Teeter retained\r\n  Respondents that the expenses were paid to EBV.Â  Respondents were retained in mid-January 2003.Â  Payment of the disputed\r\n  sums was made in mid-May 2003. \r\n[8]&nbsp; Moreover,\r\n  the judgmental immunity rule, if adopted, would serve merely as an adjunct at\r\n  the summary judgment stage.Â  The judgmental immunity rule would not shield an\r\n  attorney from a malpractice claim when there is evidence of a failure to act\r\n  with a reasonable degree of skill and care, which proximately causes damage,\r\n  regardless of the attorney's good faith.Â  Good faith, standing alone, is no\r\n  defense to the objective-based malpractice standard.Â  See Ardis v.\r\n    Sessions, 383 S.C. 528, 682 S.E.2d 249 (2009).Â Â Â Â  \r\n[9]&nbsp; I agree with the majorityâ€™s determination that\r\n  Scarminach failed to establish the appropriate standard of care and satisfy the\r\n  &quot;most probably&quot; requirement to prove proximate cause.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  his testimony and post-deposition affidavit are irrelevant to the determination\r\n  of whether Harris Teeter has set forth sufficient evidence to survive summary\r\n  judgment.Â  I disagree, however, with the conclusion that Levick's\r\n  post-deposition affidavit is a sham because this later affidavit did not\r\n  contradict the position he took at his deposition.Â  See Cothran v. Brown,\r\n  357 S.C. 210, 218, 592 S.E.2d 629, 633 (2004) (stating under the sham affidavit\r\n  rule, a court may disregard a subsequent affidavit as a shamâ€”as not creating an\r\n  issue of fact for purposes of summary judgmentâ€”if the subsequent affidavit\r\n  contradicts a partyâ€™s own prior sworn statement).\r\n[10]&nbsp; I note even in the pre-hearing memorandum and in\r\n  opening and closing statements, Respondents merely mentioned Kiriakides by name, listed the five factor test, and generally stated the factors weighed\r\n  in Harris Teeter's favor.Â  Respondents never produced any evidence\r\n  demonstrating how these two Kiriakides factors applied to the facts of\r\n  this case.Â Â Â  \r\n[11]&nbsp; Even if I were to agree with the circuit court and\r\n  the majority that Levick failed to satisfy the most probably requirement in his\r\n  second statement, Harris Teeter has still presented sufficient evidence to\r\n  overcome Respondents' motion for summary judgment by virtue of Levick's first\r\n  statement.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[12]&nbsp; The majority holds that Harris Teeterâ€™s claim fails\r\n  for lack of proximate cause because the arbitrator, in his ruling, did cite and\r\n  discuss all the Kiriakides factors.Â  In response, Harris Teeter offered\r\n  the testimony of Levick, as discussed above.Â  These two competing\r\n  viewpointsâ€”that the arbitrator fully considered Kiriakides and that he\r\n  most probably would have reached a different conclusion had the Respondents\r\n  fully presented Kiriakides to himâ€”are the sine qua non of denying\r\n  summary judgment: a genuine issue of material fact.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Scott Matthew Wild, Respondent","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2010-10-29-01","description":"","date":"2010-11-01","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of Scott Matthew Wild, Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nOn  October 26, 2010, respondent pled guilty to Aggravated Battery in Chatham  County, Georgia.&nbsp; The Office of  Disciplinary Counsel petitions the Court to place respondent on interim  suspension pursuant to Rule 17(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n  \r\n   The  petition is granted.&nbsp; Respondent&rsquo;s license to practice law in this state is suspended  until further order of the Court.&nbsp;\r\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    s/Jean Hoefer Toal\r\n      Jean Hoefer Toal\r\n      Chief Justice\r\n  \r\n\r\nColumbia,   South Carolina\r\nOctober 29, 2010 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26888","title":"City of Greenville v.

Â On appeal, the circuit court\r\n  affirmed Appellant's conviction, finding the ordinance was constitutional and\r\n  that the municipal court judge properly denied Appellant's motions for a\r\n  directed verdict and a new trial.Â  This Court certified the case pursuant to\r\n  Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was convicted of violating a City of\r\n  Greenville ordinance (the ordinance), entitled &quot;Molesting, disturbing, or\r\n  following persons,&quot; which provides:\r\n\r\n\tIt\r\n  shall be unlawful for any person to:\r\n\t(1)\r\n  Willfully or intentionally interfere with, disturb or in any way molest any\r\n  person in the city while on any public street, lane, alley, sidewalk, park, or\r\n  square or in any place of public amusement or other building or place or upon\r\n  privately owned premises where such person may have entered without permission\r\n  or as a trespasser;\r\n\t(2)\r\n  Invite any person to or attempt to have any person enter an automobile for the\r\n  purpose of molesting or willfully disturbing such person;\r\n\t(3)\r\n  Molest or disturb any person by the making of obscene remarks or such remarks\r\n  and actions as would humiliate, insult, or scare any person;\r\n\t(4)\r\n  Follow any person along any street, sidewalk, or other place within the city\r\n  for the purpose of molesting, disturbing, harassing, or annoying such person;\r\n  or\r\n\t(5)\r\n  Exhibit, display, or gesture in any public place and in the presence of any\r\n  other person any lewd or lascivious act or condition that depicts actual or\r\n  simulated sexual conduct, regardless of whether or not the person exhibiting,\r\n  displaying, or gesturing exposes the private parts of his person.\r\n\tGreenville,\r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 24-32 (1985).\r\n\r\nAppellant was loudly\r\n  preaching against homosexuality on a\r\n  public sidewalk in downtown Greenville.Â  Officer Patricia Mullinax cited\r\n  Appellant for violating the ordinance after he directed a comment to three\r\n  young women as they passed by.Â  Two of the women testified Appellant yelled to\r\n  them, &quot;Faggots, you will burn in hell.&quot;Â  Officer Mullinax testified\r\n  she cited Appellant as a result of the comment he directed at the women.\r\nAt\r\n  the close of the City's evidence, Appellant moved for a directed verdict, which\r\n  the trial judge denied.Â  The jury found Appellant guilty of violating the ordinance,\r\n  and the trial judge imposed a fine of $200.Â  The circuit court affirmed\r\n  Appellant's conviction.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial judge properly deny Appellant's\r\n  directed verdict motion and motion for a new trial?\r\n\tII. Â Â Â Â  Is\r\n  the ordinance unconstitutional on its face?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Did the trial judge properly\r\n  deny Appellant's directed verdict motion and motion for a new trial?\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in affirming the municipal court's denial of his\r\n  directed verdict motion.Â  Specifically, Appellant argues the City presented no\r\n  evidence that he violated any subsection of the ordinance.Â  We agree as to\r\n  subsections (1), (2), (4), and (5).\r\nA\r\n  defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce\r\n  evidence of the offense charged. Â State v. Parris, 363 S.C. 477, 481,\r\n  611 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2005).Â  In reviewing a motion for directed verdict, the\r\n  trial judge is concerned with the existence of the evidence, not with its\r\n  weight.Â  Id. at 481, 611 S.E.2d at 502-03. Â On appeal from the denial of\r\n  a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the State.Â  Id. at 481, 611 S.E.2d at 503.Â  If there is any\r\n  direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to\r\n  prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was properly submitted\r\n  to the jury.Â  Id.\r\nThe circuit court affirmed the municipal court's\r\n  denial of Appellant's directed verdict motion, finding the testimony of each of\r\n  the women, alone, was sufficient to submit the issue to the jury.\r\nWe\r\n  find the circuit court erred in affirming the municipal court's denial of\r\n  Appellant's directed verdict motion as to subsections (1), (2), (4), and (5).Â  We find as to subsections (2), (4), and (5) the City\r\n  presented no evidence that Appellant invited anyone into an automobile,\r\n  followed anyone, or displayed any lewd behavior.\r\nWe also find the trial judge should have\r\n  granted Appellant's directed verdict motion as to subsection (1).Â  Viewing the\r\n  evidence in a light most favorable to the City, there is no evidence Appellant\r\n  was guilty of violating this subsection.Â  Both subsections (1) and (3) criminalize\r\n  molesting or disturbing others.Â  The proscription of subsection (3) relates\r\n  solely to speech that would molest or disturb others.Â  Officer Mullinax testified she arrested Appellant\r\n  only on the basis of his verbal comment.Â  The City presented no evidence that,\r\n  other than through his speech, Appellant engaged in any conduct that would\r\n  disturb or molest others.Â  We find the circuit court erred in affirming the\r\n  municipal court's denial of Appellant's directed verdict motion as to these\r\n  subsections.\r\nBecause we find the trial court should have directed a\r\n  verdict of acquittal as to these subsections, we need not address their\r\n  constitutionality.Â  See Morris v. Anderson County, 349 S.C. 607,\r\n  564 S.E.2d 649 (2002) (Court will not unnecessarily reach constitutional questions).\r\nII.&nbsp; Is subsection (3)\r\n  unconstitutional on its face?\r\nAppellant argues subsection (3) of the ordinance is\r\n  unconstitutional on its face.Â  Specifically, Appellant argues the provision is\r\n  unconstitutionally vague.Â  We agree.\r\n\r\n\tIn determining whether a statute is vague, the Court\r\n  has held:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe\r\n  concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the constitutional principle\r\n  that procedural due process requires fair notice and proper standards for\r\n  adjudication.Â  The primary issues involved are whether the provisions of a\r\n  penal statute are sufficiently definite to give reasonable notice of the\r\n  prohibited conduct to those who wish to avoid its penalties and to apprise\r\n  Judge and jury of standards for the determination of guilt.Â  If the statute is\r\n  so obscure that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its\r\n  meaning and differ as to its applicability, it is unconstitutional.\r\n\t\tCity of Beaufort v. Baker, 315 S.C. 146, 152, 432 S.E.2d 470, 473-74 (1993) (quoting \r\n\t\tState\r\n  v. Albert, 257 S.C. 131, 134, 184 S.E.2d 605, 606 (1971)).\r\n\t\r\n\r\n&quot;The Fourteenth Amendment does not permit a State\r\n  to make criminal the peaceful expression of unpopular views.&quot;Â  Edwards\r\n    v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 237, 83 S.Ct. 680, 684, 9 L.Ed.2d 697\r\n  (1963).Â  In Edwards, a group of African Americans were convicted of\r\n  breach of peace after they marched peacefully on a sidewalk around the State\r\n  House grounds to publicize their dissatisfaction with discriminatory actions\r\n  against African Americans.Â  The United States Supreme Court found the arrest,\r\n  conviction, and punishment of the defendants infringed their constitutionally\r\n  protected right of free speech. Â Id. at 236, 83 S.Ct. at 684.Â  The Court\r\n  found the defendants were convicted of an offense &quot;so generalized as to be\r\n  not susceptible of exact definition.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The Court stated:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e do not review in this case criminal convictions resulting\r\n  from the evenhanded application of a precise and narrowly drawn regulatory\r\n  statute evincing a legislative judgment that certain specific conduct be\r\n  limited or proscribed.Â  If, for example, the petitioners had been convicted\r\n  upon evidence that they had violated a law regulating traffic, or had disobeyed\r\n  a law reasonably limiting the periods during which the State House grounds were\r\n  open to the public, this would be a different case.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nWe find subsection (3) is unconstitutionally vague\r\n  because the words &quot;humiliate,&quot; &quot;insult,&quot; and &quot;scare&quot; are not sufficiently definite to give\r\n  reasonable notice of the prohibited conduct.Â  This provision is subjective because\r\n  the words that humiliate, insult, or scare one person may not have the same\r\n  effect on another person.Â  Therefore, people of common intelligence may be\r\n  forced to guess at the provision's meaning and may differ as to its\r\n  applicability.Â  Subsection (3), like the statute in Edwards, is not\r\n  precisely written in a way that would notify a person of the certain specific conduct that is prohibited.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find subsection (3) is unconstitutional because it is facially vague.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Remaining Issues\r\nAppellant also argues the ordinance is\r\n  unconstitutionally overbroad, unconstitutional as applied, and that it violates\r\n  the South Carolina Religious Freedom Act.Â  Because we find subsection (3) is\r\n  unconstitutional on other grounds and that Appellant was entitled to a directed\r\n  verdict as to all other subsections, we decline to address these issues. Â Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1998) (appellate court need not discuss remaining issues when\r\n  disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find Appellant was entitled to a directed verdict as to subsections (1), (2),\r\n  (4), and (5) of the ordinance.Â  We further find subsection (3) is invalid\r\n  because it is facially unconstitutional.Â  Appellant's conviction is therefore\r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26889","title":"In the Matter of Sean J.

Prendergast\r\n  (Respondent) involving Respondent's solicitation of a client to invest funds in\r\n  a commercial real estate venture.Â  After a full investigation, the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed Formal Charges against Respondent.Â  Following\r\n  a hearing,[1] a Hearing Panel of the Commission (the Panel) found Respondent had committed misconduct\r\n  and recommended that the Court impose a definite suspension for a period of two\r\n  years.Â  Neither the ODC nor Respondent took exception to the Panel Report.[2]Â \r\n  Based on the admitted allegations of misconduct, we find disbarment is the\r\n  appropriate sanction.[3]\r\nI.&nbsp; FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRespondent, who was admitted to the South Carolina Bar\r\n  on June 11, 2002, represented Thomas M. Oppold, Jr. (Client) in an estate\r\n  planning transaction and served as an attorney for various business entities\r\n  owned by Client.Â  \r\nIn August 2005, during the course of his\r\n  representation of Client, Respondent solicited Client to invest funds in a\r\n  commercial real estate venture referred to as the Wando Park Project (the\r\n  &quot;Wando Project&quot;).Â  Ultimately, Client invested $65,000 through WP\r\n  Property, L.L.C., an entity created by Respondent.Â  According to Client, he\r\n  made the investment based on the belief that Respondent had also invested\r\n  approximately $90,000 in the project. Â \r\nAfter Client lost his entire investment, he filed a\r\n  Complaint with the Commission on February 12, 2007. Â By letter dated February\r\n  15, 2007, the ODC notified Respondent of the Complaint and requested a response\r\n  within fifteen days.Â  Respondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate\r\n  with the ODC in regard to the February 15, 2007 letter. \r\nOn April 17, 2007, the ODC sent Respondent a letter\r\n  pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982),[4] again requesting a response. Â Respondent failed to respond or otherwise\r\n  communicate with the ODC following the mailing of the Treacy letter.Â  \r\nOn July 16, 2007, Respondent was served with a Notice\r\n  of Full Investigation, which required a response within thirty days.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to comply with the request for a response to the Notice of\r\n  Full Investigation.Â  Subsequently, a subpoena for Respondent's file concerning\r\n  Client was issued on August 22, 2007, and served on Respondent on August 24,\r\n  2007.Â Â  Respondent failed to comply with the subpoena for documents.Â  A Notice\r\n  to Appear, dated August 22, 2007, was served on Respondent on August 24, 2007.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to appear on September 19, 2007, to respond to questions\r\n  under oath as directed by the Notice to Appear.\r\nAs a result of Respondent's failure to respond and\r\n  failure to cooperate with the above-referenced requests, this Court placed Respondent\r\n  on Interim Suspension on September 21, 2007.[5]Â  In the Matter of Prendergast, 375 S.C. 188, 651 S.E.2d 605 (2007).Â  \r\nFollowing a full investigation, the ODC filed Formal\r\n  Charges on December 28, 2007. Â On April 7, 2008, Respondent filed a Response to\r\n  the Formal Charges.Â  During the pendency of the Formal Charges, the South\r\n  Carolina Bar and ultimately this Court suspended Respondent for failure to pay license\r\n  fees.Â  \r\nRespondent was served with notice of the Formal\r\n  Charges hearing by certified mail on June 26, 2009, at the address provided by\r\n  Respondent.Â  Respondent, however, failed to appear and was not represented at\r\n  the Formal Charges hearing that was held on July 29, 2009.Â  \r\nAt the beginning of the hearing, the ODC offered\r\n  testimony that Respondent was notified both orally and in writing regarding the\r\n  date of the Formal Charges hearing. Â Because Respondent failed to appear, the\r\n  ODC moved for the Panel to find that Respondent was deemed to have admitted the\r\n  factual allegations in the Formal Charges and to have accepted any\r\n  recommendation by the ODC as to a sanction.[6]Â \r\n  The ODC recommended disbarment as the appropriate sanction for Respondent's\r\n  misconduct.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Panel determined\r\n  that Respondent had been properly served with Notice of the Formal Charges\r\n  hearing.Â  \r\nIn its report dated December 10, 2009, the Panel noted\r\n  that Respondent's failure to appear at the Formal Charges hearing constituted\r\n  an admission of the factual allegations contained in the Formal Charges.Â  \r\nAfter outlining Respondent's representation of Client,\r\n  the Panel noted the allegations of misconduct as follows:\r\n\r\n\tRespondent failed to fully disclose the terms of the\r\n  commercial business transaction to Complainant in writing and in a manner that\r\n  could be easily understood by Complainant.Â  Respondent failed to advise\r\n  Complainant in writing of the desirability of seeking independent legal counsel\r\n  regarding the transaction.Â  Respondent failed to give Complainant a reasonable\r\n  opportunity to seek such counsel.Â  Respondent failed to seek informed consent,\r\n  in the form of writing signed by the Complainant.Â  Respondent failed to outline\r\n  the essential terms of the transaction and Respondent's role in the\r\n  transaction, including whether Respondent would be representing Complainant in\r\n  the transaction.Â  Respondent was dishonest in his representations to\r\n  Complainant regarding Respondent's Ninety Thousand and no/100 ($90,000.00)\r\n  Dollars Investment in the Wando Project and in Respondent's representations to\r\n  Complainant concerning any possible return on Complainant's investment.Â \r\n  Complainant lost his entire investment in the commercial real estate project\r\n  that Respondent had solicited him to participate in due to Respondent's\r\n  dishonesty, misrepresentations and failure to fully inform and advise\r\n  Complainant. \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Panel also chronicled Respondent's failure to respond and cooperate with the\r\n  disciplinary proceedings.Â  \r\nBased on the admitted allegations of misconduct, the\r\n  Panel concluded that Respondent violated the following South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct (RPC), of Rule 407:Â  Rule 1.8 (outlining conflict of\r\n  interest involving business transactions with clients)[7];\r\n  Rule 8.1(b) (&quot;[A] lawyer in connection with a . . . disciplinary matter,\r\n  shall not fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known\r\n  by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a\r\n  lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except\r\n  that this rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected\r\n  by Rule 1.6.&quot;); and Rules 8.4(a), (d) (&quot;It is professional misconduct\r\n  for a lawyer to: Â violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts\r\n  of another; or engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\r\n  misrepresentation.&quot;). \r\nAdditionally, the Panel found Respondent committed\r\n  misconduct with respect to the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), of Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (&quot;It\r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate or\r\n  attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, or any\r\n  other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers.&quot;);\r\n  and Rule 7(a)(3) (&quot;It shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\n  willfully violate a valid order of the Supreme Court, Commission or panels of\r\n  the Commission in a proceeding under these rules, willfully fail to appear\r\n  personally as directed, willfully fail to comply with a subpoena issued under\r\n  these rules, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a\r\n  disciplinary authority to include a request for a response or appearance under\r\n  Rule 19(b)(1), (c)(3) or (c)(4).&quot;).Â  \r\nThe Panel took into consideration the following\r\n  aggravating circumstances:Â  (1) Respondent's pattern of not responding and not\r\n  cooperating with the ODC's investigation; and (2) Respondent's previous\r\n  disciplinary history included a sanction for similar misconduct. \r\nIn view of these findings, the Panel recommended\r\n  Respondent be suspended for a period of two years.Â  The Panel Report did not\r\n  address the issue of costs.\r\nII.&nbsp; DISCUSSION\r\nAs previously stated, neither Respondent nor the ODC\r\n  raise any exceptions to the Panel's report and recommendation.Â  Because\r\n  Respondent has been found in default and, thus, is deemed to have admitted to\r\n  all of the factual allegations, the sole question before this Court is whether\r\n  to accept the Panel's recommended sanction.Â  See In the Matter of\r\n    Jacobsen, 386 S.C. 598, 606, 690 S.E.2d 560, 564 (2010) (concluding the\r\n  sole question before the Court was whether to accept the Panel's recommended\r\n  sanction where Respondent had been found in default and deemed to have admitted\r\n  to all the factual allegations); In the Matter of Braghirol, 383 S.C.\r\n  379, 386, 680 S.E.2d 284, 288 (2009) (citing Rule 24, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  and recognizing that this Court need only determine the appropriate sanction\r\n  where Respondent is deemed to have admitted all factual allegations of the\r\n  Formal Charges and the charges of misconduct).\r\nThis Court has the sole authority to discipline\r\n  attorneys and to decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the\r\n  record.Â  In the Matter of Welch, 355 S.C. 93, 96, 584 S.E.2d 369, 370\r\n  (2003).Â  &quot;The Court is not bound by the panel's recommendation and may\r\n  make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.&quot;Â  In the Matter\r\n    of Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102, 106 (2008).Â  \r\n&quot;A disciplinary violation must be proven by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence.&quot;Â  In the Matter of Greene, 371 S.C. 207,\r\n  216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see Rule 8, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR\r\n  (&quot;Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall be established by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the charges shall be on the\r\n  disciplinary counsel.&quot;).Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  terms of Respondent's business dealings with Client, we find Rule 1.8(a), RPC, of Rule 407, SCACR is primarily\r\n  implicated.Â  Although Rule 1.8 does not prohibit attorney-client business\r\n  relationships, it clearly delineates three mandatory requirements an attorney\r\n  must satisfy in order to comply with the standards of ethical conduct.Â  As a\r\n  result, we have cautioned attorneys about engaging in business transactions\r\n  with clients.Â  See In the Matter of Harper, 326 S.C. 186, 193,\r\n  485 S.E.2d 376, 380 (1997) (&quot;In view of the trust placed in attorneys by\r\n  their clients and attorneys' often superior expertise in complicated financial\r\n  matters, attorneys must take every possible precaution to ensure that clients\r\n  are fully aware of the risks inherent in a proposed transaction and of the need\r\n  for independent and objective advice.&quot;);Â  In the Matter of Conway,\r\n  305 S.C. 388, 393, 409 S.E.2d 357, 360 (1991) (noting that Rule 1.8(a) does not\r\n  forbid attorney-client business relationships but recognizing that &quot;they\r\n  require attorneys to maintain the highest professional and ethical standards in\r\n  their dealings with clients.Â  No exceptions to that duty exist merely because\r\n  an attorney chooses to become involved in business transactions with his\r\n  clients.&quot;). \r\nHere, based on the admitted allegations of misconduct,\r\n  we find Respondent not only misrepresented the extent of his financial\r\n  investment in the real estate venture, but also the potential return on\r\n  Client's investment. Â Furthermore, Respondent violated each of the three mandatory\r\n  provisions of Rule 1.8(a), RPC, of Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Specifically, in entering\r\n  into the business venture with Client, Respondent failed to:Â  (1) fully\r\n  disclose the terms of the commercial business transaction to Client in writing\r\n  and in a manner that could be easily understood by Client; (2) advise Client in\r\n  writing of the desirability of seeking independent legal counsel regarding the\r\n  transaction and to give Client a reasonable opportunity to seek such counsel;\r\n  and (3) seek informed consent, in the form of writing signed by the Client, and\r\n  to outline the essential terms of the transaction and Respondent's role in the\r\n  transaction, including whether Respondent would be representing Client in the\r\n  transaction.Â Â Â  \r\nIn addition to the misconduct regarding Respondent's\r\n  business relationship with Client, we must also consider Respondent's failure\r\n  to respond and cooperate with the disciplinary proceedings. \r\nAlthough Respondent claimed in his Answer that he\r\n  could not recall whether he received the disciplinary correspondence, the ODC\r\n  counsel presented evidence that Respondent had been served at the address on\r\n  record with the South Carolina Bar.Â  Moreover, the Commission notified\r\n  Respondent both orally and in writing about the Formal Charges hearing.Â  Despite\r\n  this definitive notification, Respondent failed to appear for the hearing.Â  Respondent\r\n  also failed to appear for the argument before this Court.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that disbarment is\r\n  the appropriate sanction for Respondent's misconduct.Â  See In the\r\n    Matter of Brown, 361 S.C. 347, 605\r\n  S.E.2d 509 (2004) (concluding disbarment was warranted where attorney committed\r\n  numerous acts of misconduct prior to and after being admitted to the South\r\n  Carolina Bar, including a joint real estate venture with a client that involved\r\n  defrauding lenders); Conway, 305 S.C. at 393, 409 S.E.2d at 360 (finding\r\n  disbarment was the appropriate sanction for attorney's unauthorized\r\n  appropriation of funds from a real estate development corporation that he had\r\n  formed with a client); see also Jacobsen, 386 S.C. at 607-08, 690\r\n  S.E.2d at 564-65 (outlining cases involving an attorney's failure to respond to\r\n  disciplinary proceedings; concluding disbarment was the appropriate sanction\r\n  where attorney was charged with multiple allegations of misconduct arising out\r\n  of his bankruptcy practice, failed to respond to formal charges, and failed to\r\n  appear at the hearing); In the Matter of Murph, 350 S.C. 1, 564 S.E.2d\r\n  673 (2002) (finding disbarment was the appropriate sanction where attorney was\r\n  charged with eighteen different matters of misconduct and failed to answer the\r\n  formal charges or appear at the hearing).\r\nIn addition to disbarment, we order Respondent to pay\r\n  the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.Â  Although\r\n  the Panel did not address costs in its report, we find the payment of costs is\r\n  a crucial component of a sanction for attorney misconduct.Â  See In the Matter of\r\n    Thompson,&nbsp;343 S.C. 1, 13, 539\r\n  S.E.2d 396, 402 (2000) (&quot;The assessment of costs is in the discretion of\r\n  the Court.&quot;); Rule 27(e)(3), RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;The Supreme\r\n  Court may assess costs against the respondent if it finds the respondent has\r\n  committed misconduct.&quot;); Rule 7(b)(6), RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR (stating sanctions for misconduct may\r\n  include the &quot;assessment of the costs of the proceedings, including the\r\n  cost of hearings, investigations, prosecution, service of process and court\r\n  reporter services&quot;).Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; CONCLUSION\r\nIn accordance with the facts and conclusion set forth\r\n  above, it is ordered that Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law in\r\n  this state.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, Respondent\r\n  shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied\r\n  with Rule 30, RLDE, of Rule 413,\r\n    SCACR, and shall surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of\r\n  Law to the Clerk of Court. Â Further, within thirty (30) days of the date of\r\n  this opinion, Respondent is ordered to reimburse the Commission and the ODC for\r\n  costs incurred in the investigation of this matter.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Respondent did not appear at the hearing.\r\n[2]Â  We also note that neither party filed briefs with\r\n  this Court.Â  Consequently, the parties are deemed to have accepted the Panel's\r\n  findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations.Â  See Rule 27(a),\r\n  RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;The failure of a party to file a brief taking\r\n  exceptions to the report constitutes acceptance of the findings of fact,\r\n  conclusions of law, and recommendations.&quot;).Â  \r\n[3]Â  Respondent did not appear at the argument before\r\n  this Court despite evidence that he received notification of the hearing via\r\n  certified mail.\r\n[4]Â  See In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C.\r\n  514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982) (recognizing that an attorney's failure to respond\r\n  to the ODC constitutes sanctionable misconduct).\r\n[5]Â  By letter dated September 18, 2007, Respondent\r\n  informed the ODC that he had just discovered the disciplinary correspondence\r\n  &quot;unopened in [his] office mailroom.&quot;Â  Based on this claim, Respondent\r\n  requested the ODC forward &quot;all correspondences and notifications&quot;\r\n  that had been sent to him since April 2007.Â  Additionally, Respondent requested\r\n  an extension to file an Answer to Client's Complaint.Â  Although the ODC\r\n  complied with Respondent's request to send copies of the correspondence dated\r\n  after April 2007, it denied Respondent's request for an extension in which to\r\n  file his response.\r\n[6]Â  See Rule 24(b), RLDE of Rule 413, SCACR\r\n  (&quot;If the respondent should fail to appear when specifically so ordered by\r\n  the hearing panel or the Supreme Court, the respondent shall be deemed to have\r\n  admitted the factual allegations which were to be the subject of such\r\n  appearance and to have conceded the merits of any motion or recommendations to\r\n  be considered at such appearance.&quot;).\r\n[7]Â Â  Specifically, Rule 1.8 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tA lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction\r\n  with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other\r\n  pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless:\r\n\t(1) the transaction and\r\n  terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the\r\n  client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can\r\n  be reasonably understood by the client;\r\n\t(2) the client is\r\n  advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable\r\n  opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel on the transaction;\r\n  and\r\n\t(3) the client gives\r\n  informed consent, in a writing signed by the client, to the essential terms of\r\n  the transaction and the lawyer's role in the transaction, including whether the\r\n  lawyer is representing the client in the transaction.\r\n\r\nRule 1.8(a), RPC, of Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26890","title":"In the Matter of Former Allendale County Magistrate Carl M.

Â§ 8-1-80 (1986).Â  The indictment alleged that respondent:Â Â  engaged in ex\r\n  parte communication with certain defendants; used his judicial position to\r\n  advance the private interests of a litigant; used a procedure for handling\r\n  fines and bond services for certain defendants which was not in accordance with\r\n  the orders of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Carolina; and\r\n  appropriated public funds for his own use and benefit.Â  On or about June 1,\r\n  2010, respondent pled guilty to the indictment.Â  He was sentenced to one (1)\r\n  year imprisonment, probated to six (6) months home incarceration, payment of a\r\n  fine and costs of $1,202.53, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of\r\n  $11,427.50.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct,\r\n  respondent admits he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial\r\n  Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall\r\n  uphold integrity and independence of judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing,\r\n    maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally\r\n    observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary\r\n    will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge\r\n  all avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of the judge's\r\n  activities); Canon 2A (judge shall\r\n  respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that\r\n  promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary);\r\n  Canon 2B (judge\r\n    shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence\r\n    the judge's judicial conduct or judgment; judge shall not lend the prestige of\r\n    judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or others; judge shall\r\n    not convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special\r\n    position to influence the judge); Canon 3 (judge shall perform duties of judicial office impartially and\r\n  diligently); Canon 3(B)(2) (judge shall be\r\n  faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it; judge shall not\r\n  be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism); Canon 3B(7)\r\n  (judge shall\r\n    not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications); and Canon 3C(1)(judge shall diligently discharge\r\n      administrative responsibilities without bias or prejudice, maintain\r\n      professional competence in judicial administration, and cooperate with other\r\n      judges and court officials in the administration of court business).Â  Respondent also admits he has violated Rule 7(a)(1) (it\r\n        shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial\r\n        Conduct) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall not apply for, seek, or\r\n  accept any judicial position whatsoever in this State without the prior express\r\n  written authorization of this Court after due service\r\n  in writing on ODC of any petition seeking the Courtâ€™s authorization.Â  Respondent\r\n  is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE\r\n  and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent no longer holds judicial office.Â  Consequently,\r\n  a public reprimand is the most severe sanction which the Court can impose.Â  See In re Oâ€™Kelley, 361 S.C. 30, 603 S.E.2d 410 (2004); In re Gravely,\r\n  321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996). \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26891","title":"In the Matter of St. George and Cottageville Municipal Court Judge Michael Evans","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26891","description":"This is an opinion removing a municipal judge from office.","date":"2010-11-08","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:div align=\"center\"\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of St. George and Cottageville Municipal Court \r\n\t\t\t\tJudge Michael Evans, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26891\r\nSubmitted October 19, 2010 - Filed November 8, 2010Â Â  \r\n\r\nREMOVED FROM OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P.

The facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn February 2008, respondent attended the\r\n  South Carolina Summary Court Judges Association Staff/Judges Seminar in Myrtle\r\n  Beach, South Carolina.Â  Jane Doe (fictitious name), a twenty year old female,\r\n  attended the seminar with respondent and his staff, although not as an employee\r\n  of his court.Â  Respondent and Doe stayed together at a hotel in the Myrtle\r\n  Beach area.Â  The hotel room was a suite and respondent denies any inappropriate\r\n  sexual conduct with Doe during the seminar.[1]Â  \r\nDoe had been charged with possession of\r\n  drug paraphernalia in the jurisdiction of Cottageville.Â  Respondent admits\r\n  that, in allowing Doe to share his hotel suite, he created an appearance of\r\n  impropriety that could undermine public confidence in the judiciary.Â  \r\nIn St. George and Cottageville,\r\n  respondent operated an alternative sentencing program known as the &quot;Judge\r\n  Michael Evans' Program&quot; or &quot;Adjournment to Dismiss.&quot;Â  Doe was\r\n  enrolled in respondent's alternative sentencing program in Cottageville; she paid\r\n  approximately $565.00 to enroll in the program and the funds went to the\r\n  general fund of the Town of Cottageville.Â  \r\nRespondent's alternative sentencing\r\n  programs were not administered or approved by the Solicitor's Office for the\r\n  Fourteenth Judicial Circuit or First Judicial Circuit.Â  Respondent admits that\r\n  he acted in contravention of an order of the Supreme Court of South Carolina in\r\n  that he operated the programs without the specific approval of the Circuit\r\n  Solicitors.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he\r\n  has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501,\r\n  SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A\r\n  (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high\r\n  standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the\r\n  integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); \r\nCanon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the\r\n    appearance of impropriety in all activities); and Canon 2A (judge shall respect\r\n    and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes\r\n    public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary).Â  Â By\r\n    violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent admits he has also violated\r\n    Rule 7(a)(1) and Rule 7(a)(9) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary\r\n    Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent, remove respondent from office,\r\n  and bar him from holding any judicial office within the unified judicial system\r\n  in South Carolina. Â See Rule 7(b)(1), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR. Â It is\r\n  therefore ordered that respondent be removed from office as of the date of the\r\n  filing of this opinion.

Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Health and Envtl. Control, 380 S.C. 349, 669 S.E.2d 899 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  We granted a writ of certiorari to review that decision.[1]Â \r\n  We reverse.\r\nI.\r\nSPA submitted permit applications to DHEC seeking a\r\n  critical area permit, coastal zone consistency certification, and a Section 401\r\n  water quality certification in order to begin developing a 300-acre marine\r\n  container terminal on the west bank of the Cooper River.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 54-3-270 (Supp. 2008).Â  To provide access to the terminal, DOT sought a\r\n  permit from DHEC to construct a road linking the terminal with Interstate 26.Â  \r\n\r\nDHEC issued public notices\r\n  regarding the pending applications and held many public hearings.Â  The League\r\n  participated in the hearings and filed multiple comment letters objecting to\r\n  the permit applications.Â  \r\nOn October 30,\r\n  2006, DHEC staff granted all necessary permits to SPA authorizing the\r\n  construction of the terminal, and on October 31, a copy of the decision was\r\n  sent to SPA by certified mail.Â  On November 2, DHEC staff made an amendment to\r\n  the permit and sent notice of the amended permit to SPA by certified mail.Â  On\r\n  November 13, SPA filed a notice of appeal with the DHEC Board merely seeking to\r\n  clarify certain terms and conditions.Â  \r\nOn November 17,\r\n  counsel for the League emailed DHEC indicating he was made aware that DHEC\r\n  granted SPA a permit, but that no public notice had been issued.Â  An employee\r\n  from DHEC responded in an email, making it plain that DHEC was aware of the\r\n  League's involvement and desire to be notified of the agency decision: &quot;Did\r\n  he also mention they [SPA] appealed it????Â  You were on the mailing list and\r\n  should have received a copy.Â  Did you not get it?&quot;Â  DHEC immediately sent\r\n  notice of the staff decision to the League.Â  The League received the notice on\r\n  November 20 by mail[2] and filed a notice of\r\n  appeal that day.Â  \r\nOn November 13, DHEC approved DOT's permit and issued notice to DOT by certified mail.Â  The\r\n  League received notice of this decision on November 29 and filed a notice of\r\n  appeal the following day on November 30.[3]Â  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(E) (Supp. 2008) was enacted in 2006 as a part of\r\n  Act No. 387 and became effective July 1, 2006.Â  This act amended and added\r\n  statutory provisions relating to administrative procedures and appeals.Â \r\n  Section 44-1-60(E) provides:\r\n\r\n\tNotice\r\n  of the department decision must be sent to the applicant, permittee, licensee,\r\n  and affected persons who have asked to be notified by certified mail, return\r\n  receipt requested.Â  The department decision becomes the final agency decision\r\n  fifteen days after notice of the department decision has been mailed to the\r\n  applicant, unless a written request for final review is filed with the\r\n  department by the applicant, permittee, licensee, or affected person.Â  \r\n\r\nThe League filed\r\n  its notices of appeal of the DHEC staff decisions regarding SPA's and DOT's\r\n  permits more than fifteen days after the staff decisions were mailed to SPA and\r\n  DOT - the applicants - but within fifteen days of the League receiving notice\r\n  of the decisions.Â  At the hearing before the DHEC Board, DHEC staff initially\r\n  argued the League's appeal was not timely.Â  The DHEC Board considered this\r\n  argument, but found the League had timely appealed.Â  The Board proceeded to\r\n  hear the merits of the League's appeal and ultimately approved the DHEC staff\r\n  decision to issue the permits.[4]Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; ALC Order\r\nThe ALC found the\r\n  League's appeal was not timely and issued an order dismissing the case.[5]Â \r\n  The ALC interpreted Â§ 44-1-60(E)Â  as unambiguously providing that a party\r\n  challenging a DHEC staff decision must file a notice of appeal with the DHEC\r\n  Board within fifteen days after the decision is mailed to the applicant.Â Â  The\r\n  ALC ruled that the League had a statutory right to request to be notified of\r\n  the decision and that there was no &quot;evidence that the League filed a\r\n  request to be notified of the decision per section 44-1-60(E).&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nTo\r\n  counter this interpretation, the League argued it was entitled to notice of the\r\n  DHEC staff decision pursuant to Regulation 61-101, which requires DHEC to send\r\n  notice of any decision to issue a Section 401 water certification permit to any\r\n  party that provides comments to a Section 401 permit application.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 61-101.G.1 (Supp. 2008).Â  The ALC first ruled Regulation 61-101\r\n  notice requirements were not applicable to this permit.[6]Â \r\n  However, the ALC went on to find the notice requirements in Regulation 61-101\r\n  directly conflicted with the notice requirements in Â§ 44-1-60(E) and,\r\n  therefore, ruled the regulation &quot;had been superseded&quot; by the statute.[7]Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Court of Appeals\r\nThe court of\r\n  appeals' opinion followed the reasoning of the ALC.Â  The court of appeals held\r\n  Â§ 44-1-60(E) unambiguously requires a party to file a request for final review\r\n  within fifteen days from the date DHEC mails the decision to the applicant -\r\n  not fifteen days after notice of the decision is received.Â Â  It held the League\r\n  &quot;failed to request notification of the staff decision as delineated in\r\n    Section 44-1-60(E).&quot;Â  S.C. Coastal Conservation League, 380\r\n  S.C. at 373, 669 S.E.2d at 911 (emphasis in original).Â  The court examined the\r\n  relevant dates and held the League had failed to comply with the statute.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals also affirmed the ALC's ruling that Regulation 61-101 was\r\n  invalid to the extent its notice provisions conflicted with Â§ 44-1-60(E).Â  The\r\n  court found Regulation 61-101 conflicted with Â§ 44-1-60(E) because it expanded\r\n  the group to which DHEC was required to give notice of a decision regarding the\r\n  issuance of a Section 401 permit.[8]\r\nWe\r\n  granted DHEC's and the League's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\n  court of appeals' opinion.Â  Although the parties disagree on the merits of the\r\n  decision to issue the permits, they both take the position that the League's\r\n  appeal to the DHEC Board was timely and that the ALC and court of appeals erred\r\n  in ruling Â§ 44-1-60(E) repealed the notice provisions set forth in Regulation\r\n  61-101.[9]Â  \r\nII.\r\nStatutory Interpretation\r\nStatutory interpretation is a question of law.Â  City of Newberry v. Newberry Elec. Co-op., Inc., 387 S.C. 254, 256, 692 S.E.2d 510, 512 (2010).Â  The primary rule of statutory construction\r\n  is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  Unless there is something in the\r\n  statute requiring a different interpretation, the words used in a statute must\r\n  be given their ordinary meaning.Â  Id.Â  When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court\r\n  must apply the statute according to its literal meaning.Â  Sloan v. Hardee,\r\n  371 S.C. 495, 498, 640 S.E.2d 457, 459 (2007).\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Time Period\r\nSection 44-1-60(E) provides,\r\n  in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  department decision becomes the final agency decision fifteen days after notice\r\n  of the department decision has been mailed to the applicant, unless a written\r\n  request for final review is filed with the department by the applicant,\r\n  permittee, licensee, or affected person.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  League and DHEC argue the fifteen day time period begins when a party receives\r\n  notice, not when notice is deposited in the mail.Â  Like the court of appeals, we\r\n  cannot accept such an interpretation.Â  The clear and unambiguous language in\r\n  the statute provides that the staff decision becomes final &quot;fifteen days\r\n  after notice of the department decision has been mailed . . .&quot;Â  Had\r\n  the legislature intended for the time period to begin running from the date a\r\n  party receives notice of the decision, the statute would have been drafted\r\n  accordingly.Â  Indeed, Â§ 44-1-60(F)(2), the provision immediately following Â§\r\n  44-1-60(E), provides &quot;[w]ithin thirty days after\r\n  the receipt of the decision an applicant, permittee, licensee, or\r\n  affected person desiring to contest the final agency decision may request a contested case hearing.&quot;\r\n  (Emphasis added).Â  The use ofÂ  the phrase &quot;receipt of the decision&quot;\r\n  in Â§ 44-1-60(F)(2) indicates that had the\r\n  legislature intended for the fifteen day time period to begin after receipt of\r\n  notice, the legislature knew how to draft the statute to accomplish this\r\n  result.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  League and DHEC argue this Court's precedent requires that the time period to\r\n  file an appeal must begin with receipt of notice.Â  In Hamm v. S.C. Pub. Svs.\r\n    Comm., we held that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(b) (1984), which provides\r\n  that a party may appeal &quot;within thirty days after the final decision of\r\n  the agency,&quot; must be read to allow aÂ  party to appeal thirty days after\r\n  receiving notice of the decision.Â  287 S.C. 180, 336 S.E.2d 470 (1985).Â \r\n  Otherwise, an agency could essentially preclude judicial review by concealing\r\n  its decision until after the expiration of the thirty days.Â  We held such an\r\n  interpretation would lead to an absurd result.Â  \r\nWe disagree with the argument that Hamm requires the time\r\n  to appeal begins upon receiving notice.Â  The Court in Hamm did not hold\r\n  that a filing period must begin with receipt of notice of an agency's\r\n  decision.Â  Rather, the Court read a notice requirement into Â§ 1-23-380(b) to\r\n  avoid &quot;an absurd result not possibly intended by the legislature.&quot;Â  Section 44-1-60(E), on the other hand, does not suffer\r\n  from the same notice infirmity, for it specifically requires DHEC to mail\r\n  notice of its decision to the applicant, permittee, licensee, and affected\r\n  persons who have asked to be notified.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Parties to be Notified\r\nIn\r\n  relevant part, Â§ 44-1-60(E) provides that &quot;[n]otice of the department\r\n  decision must be sent to the applicant, permittee, licensee, and affected\r\n  persons who have asked to be notified by certified mail, return receipt\r\n  requested.&quot;Â  As stated above, the statute clearly and unambiguously\r\n  provides that the decision is final fifteen days after notice is mailed to the\r\n  applicant.Â  However, the statute is not clear as to how an individual or entity\r\n  acquires the status of &quot;affected persons who have asked to be notified.&quot;Â \r\n  Moreover, the statute is silent as to whether DHEC must simultaneously mail notice to &quot;the applicant, permittee, licensee, and affected persons\r\n  who have asked to be notified.&quot;Â  Of course, without construing Â§\r\n  44-1-60(E) as requiring that notice of the agency decision be mailed\r\n  simultaneously to those entitled to notice, the statute would be meaningless in\r\n  terms of providing notice.Â  Here, simultaneous notice was not given to the\r\n  League.Â  The question becomes whether the League is an &quot;affected person.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp; Affected Persons Who Have\r\n  Asked to be Notified\r\nThe\r\n  ALC and the court of appeals found that the League failed to avail itself of\r\n  the right to be notified under Â§ 44-1-60(E) because the League failed &quot;to\r\n  make a formal request to be notified of a decision&quot; and &quot;failed to\r\n  request notification of the staff decision as delineated in section 44-1-60(E).&quot;Â \r\n  We believe the November 17th email acknowledgement by DHEC refutes\r\n  the suggestion that the League failed to request to be notified of the agency\r\n  decision.\r\nIn\r\n  our view, the ALC's and the court of appeals' foray into the degree of &quot;formality&quot;\r\n  needed for Â§ 44-1-60(E) &quot;affected person&quot; status is not necessary for\r\n  deciding this appeal.Â  DHEC's concession that the League was on the &quot;mailing\r\n  list and should have received a copy [of the permit decision]&quot; is\r\n  sufficient for purposes of acquiring &quot;affected person&quot; status.Â \r\n  Therefore, given DHEC's concession, we hold the League had asked to be notified\r\n  of the DHEC staff decision on the permits.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the DHEC Board found the appeal was timely.Â  Although the Board based this\r\n  decision on the fact that the League filed a request for an appeal within\r\n  fifteen days of receiving notice, which is not consistent with the statutory\r\n  language that the appeal be filed within fifteen days of mailing, the Board's\r\n  ruling indicates that DHEC recognized that the League had asked to be notified\r\n  of the decision and was entitled to notification.Â  Along the same lines, at the\r\n  hearing before the ALC, DHEC never stated it followed a formal procedure as to\r\n  how a party acquires &quot;affected persons who have asked to be notified&quot;\r\n  status.Â  To the contrary, DHEC indicated it took an informal approach in\r\n  deciding which parties it notified of its decision.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  finding that the League had asked to be notified of the DHEC staff decision\r\n  regarding the SPA and DOT permits, we decline to set forth a process of how a\r\n  party asks to be notified in all cases falling under Â§ 44-1-60(E).Â  We merely\r\n  hold, under the facts of this case, it is clear the League asked to be notified\r\n  of the DHEC staff decision regarding the SPA and DOT permits and DHEC believed\r\n  the League had asked to be notified.Â  The record clearly establishes that\r\n  throughout the permit application process in this matter, the League was not an\r\n  obscure or unknown party.Â  The League has been involved in this particular\r\n  permitting process from the beginning.Â  Therefore, SPA's bold statement that\r\n  DHEC should not bear the burden of &quot;guess[ing] which commenter or member\r\n  of the public would like to know about particular decisions&quot; is unavailing\r\n  under these facts.\r\n2.&nbsp; Simultaneous Notifications\r\nWe\r\n  now turn to a potential ambiguity in the statute.Â  For the reasons stated\r\n  above, the plain language of Â§ 44-1-60(E) provides the decision of DHEC staff\r\n  becomes final fifteen days after notice of the decision is mailed, and the\r\n  statute requires DHEC to send notice of the decision to the applicant,\r\n  permittee, licensee, and affected persons who have asked to be notified by\r\n  certified mail.Â  However, the statute is silent as to whether DHEC must mail\r\n  these notifications simultaneously.Â  In Hamm, we read a notice\r\n  requirement into the statute in order to avoid an absurd result.Â  We believe\r\n  the same concerns are present here.Â  Failing to interpret this statute as\r\n  requiring DHEC to mail notifications simultaneously would mean DHEC could mail\r\n  notice of its decision to the applicant and, fifteen days later, mail notice of\r\n  the decision to affected persons who have asked to be notified.Â  Under this\r\n  scenario, the time period for appealing the decision would have expired by the\r\n  time the affected person receives notice; thus, &quot;affected persons&quot;\r\n  could be precluded from seeking review.Â  Interpreting the statute to require\r\n  DHEC to mail the notice of decision to the applicant, permittee, licensee, and\r\n  affected person at the same time provides a uniform procedure, gives all\r\n  parties equal opportunity to challenge a decision, and is consistent with the\r\n  legislative purpose.Â  See Act No. 387, Â§ 53 (&quot;This act is intended\r\n  to provide a uniform procedure for contested cases and appeals from\r\n  administrative agencies.&quot;).Â  As a final matter, we hold that in situations\r\n  where DHEC fails to simultaneously notify the applicant, permittee, licensee,\r\n  and affected persons asking to be notified, the latest date of mailing controls\r\n  when the fifteen day period begins to run.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Repeal of Regulation 61-101\r\nFinally,\r\n  DHEC argues the ALC and the court of appeals erred in finding Regulation 61-101\r\n  conflicts with Â§ 44-1-60(E) and is therefore invalid.Â  DHEC expresses\r\n  particular concern that this ruling could invalidate other notification\r\n  provisions contained within its numerous regulations.\r\nAn\r\n  administrative regulation is valid as long as it is reasonably related to the\r\n  purpose of the enabling legislation.Â  McNickel's Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of\r\n    Revenue, 331 S.C. 629, 634, 503 S.E.2d 723, 725 (1998).Â  Although a\r\n  regulation has the force of law, it must fall when it alters or adds to a\r\n  statute.Â  Id.\r\nDHEC\r\n  is responsible for managing the welfare of our public health systems and\r\n  environment.Â  In discharging these duties, DHEC has implemented practices and\r\n  procedures which foster transparency and full disclosure in all matters\r\n  regarding its regulatory authority.Â  To this end, DHEC has enacted various\r\n  notification regulations requiring it to send notice to the public of permit\r\n  applications and to notify particular parties of DHEC's decision on the\r\n  applications.Â  Regulation 61-101 is one of these types of notification\r\n  regulations.Â  This regulation establishes procedures and policies for\r\n  implementing water quality certification requirements of Section 401 of the\r\n  Clean Water Act and requires DHEC to send notice to specific parties.Â  See Regs. 61-101.G.1 (providing DHEC shall mail notice of a proposed\r\n  decision on an application for water certification to the applicant; agencies\r\n  having jurisdiction or interest over the activity site; owners or residents of\r\n  property adjoining the area of the proposed activity; and those persons\r\n  providing comment in response to the initial notice of application).\r\nIn\r\n  our view, the notice provisions in Regulation 61-101 do not conflict with Â§\r\n  44-1-60(E).Â  Section 44-1-60(E) sets forth the procedure for appealing from a\r\n  staff decision and provides which parties DHEC is required to notify by\r\n  certified mail of the decision.Â  On the other hand, Regulation 61-101 serves to\r\n  further DHEC's policy goals including providing notice to the public, fostering\r\n  openness, and keeping the public informed about important environmental\r\n  decisions.Â  Section 44-1-60(E) addresses appellate procedures, while Regulation\r\n  61-101 addresses public notice.Â  Although Â§ 44-1-60(E) places an affirmative\r\n  duty on DHEC to send simultaneous notification of appealable staff decisions to\r\n  the applicant, permittee, licensee, and affected persons who have asked to be\r\n  notified by certified mail, it does not prohibit DHEC from sending notice of\r\n  these decisions to additional persons.Â  For these reasons, we find the\r\n  regulation does not alter or add to the statute.Â Â  \r\nIII.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we hold the ALC and court of appeals erred in ruling the League's appeal\r\n  was not timely.Â  Section 44-1-60(E) requires DHEC to simultaneously send notice\r\n  of its decision to the applicant, permittee, licensee, and affected persons\r\n  requesting to be notified by certified mail, and the decision becomes final\r\n  fifteen days after the decision has been mailed.Â  In this case, we find that\r\n  because the League was an affected person who asked to be notified, the\r\n  decision did not become final until fifteen days after DHEC mailed the decision\r\n  to the League.Â  Because the League filed the request for appeal within fifteen\r\n  days of DHEC mailing it notice of the decision, the appeal was timely.Â \r\n  Finally, we hold the notice provision in Regulation 61-101 does not add to or\r\n  alter Â§ 44-1-60(E), and the regulation therefore remains valid.[10]Â Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY, J., and Acting\r\n  Justices James E. Moore and William P. Keesley, concur. PLEICONES, ACTING CHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE, dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â \r\n  Given the settlement agreement between the South Carolina Coastal Conservation\r\n  League and the South Carolina Ports Authority, our ruling can have no practical\r\n  effect upon the case before us.Â  Consequently, I would find that the case is\r\n  moot and would dismiss certiorari.Â  See Willis v. Wukela, 379\r\n  S.C. 126, 128, 665 S.E.2d 171, 172 (2008) (holding a case becomes moot when a\r\n  ruling will have no practical effect upon the existing controversy).\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We note that the issues presented in this case are purely questions\r\n  of statutory interpretation regarding appeals from the DHEC staff decisions to\r\n  the DHEC Board.Â  The merits of the staff decision are not implicated in this\r\n  appeal and are not addressed by either side.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; It appears DHEC\r\n  mailed written notice of the decision regarding SPA's permit on Friday,\r\n  November 17, and the League received this notice on Monday, November 20.\r\n[3]&nbsp; In its brief, the\r\n  League states it never received mailed written notice of the staff decision\r\n  regarding DOT's permit.Â  It is unclear how the League received actual notice of\r\n  the issuance of DOT's permit.\r\n[4]&nbsp; At the beginning\r\n  of the hearing, SPA and DHEC staff informed the DHEC Board that SPA's appeal,\r\n  in which they merely sought to clarify certain terms in the permit, had been\r\n  resolved.Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp; The ALC granted\r\n  SPA's motion to intervene in the action involving DOT and considered the\r\n  League's appeals from the issuance of both permits together.Â  The matters were\r\n  consolidated in the court of appeals.\r\n[6]&nbsp; Specifically, the ALC found this permit involved not only a Section 401 permit, but also a\r\n  critical area permit.Â  Regulation 61-101 provides that where a critical area is\r\n  involved, the procedures found in the critical area permitting regime apply,\r\n  rather than the procedures found in the Section 401 permitting regime.Â  The\r\n  critical area regulations do not require DHEC to notify all parties who provide\r\n  comment to the application.Â  \r\n[7]&nbsp; See Act No.\r\n  387, Â§ 53 (&quot;This act is intended to provide a uniform procedure for\r\n  contested cases and appeals from administrative agencies and to the extent that\r\n  a provision of this act conflicts with an existing statute or regulation, the\r\n  provisions of this act are controlling.&quot;).Â  \r\n[8]&nbsp; Regulation 61-101\r\n  requires DHEC to notify: agencies having jurisdiction or an interest in the\r\n  site; adjoining property owners; and parties providing comments.Â  However, Â§\r\n  44-1-60(E) only requires DHEC to notify: the applicant; permittee; licensee;\r\n  and affected parties requesting notification.Â  \r\n[9]&nbsp; Following oral\r\n  argument, the parties notified the Court that the League and SPA had resolved\r\n  the League's substantive challenge to the underlying permits.Â  DHEC, which is\r\n  not a party to the League's settlement agreement with SPA, has requested that\r\n  the Court resolve the appeal.Â  Accordingly, we proceed with a resolution of\r\n  this appeal.\r\n[10]&nbsp; Because the League\r\n  and SPA have reached an agreement on the League's substantive challenges to the\r\n  underlying permits, a remand is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26893","title":"In the Matter of Jessica R.

Boney, of Union, pro se Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this attorney\r\n  disciplinary matter, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (&quot;Commission&quot;)\r\n  investigated allegations of misconduct involving Jessica R. Boney\r\n  (&quot;Respondent&quot;) in six matters, including the failure to keep clients\r\n  reasonably informed, the mishandling of client funds, and the failure to act\r\n  with due diligence.Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) filed\r\n  formal charges against Respondent.Â  A hearing panel of the Commission\r\n  (&quot;Hearing Panel&quot;) issued its Panel Report recommending disbarment\r\n  based on the underlying misconduct, Respondent's failure to fully cooperate in\r\n  the disciplinary investigation, and her failure to answer the formal charges\r\n  and appear at the hearing on those charges.Â  The Hearing Panel also recommended\r\n  that Respondent be required to pay the costs of these proceedings and to\r\n  reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for any amounts paid on her\r\n  behalf.Â  Neither Respondent nor ODC has filed a brief taking exception to the\r\n  Panel Report.Â  We agree with the recommendation of the Hearing Panel and hereby\r\n  disbar Respondent for her misconduct.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  was admitted to the practice of law in South Carolina on September 23, 2003.Â  Respondent\r\n  closed her law practice in Union, South Carolina and left the state in January\r\n  2006.Â  \r\nBy\r\n  order of the Court, she was placed on interim suspension on February 1, 2006\r\n  and Sammy Diamaduros was appointed to protect her clients' interests.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Commission on Continuing Legal Education (&quot;CLE&quot;) and\r\n  Specialization administratively suspended Respondent from the practice of law\r\n  on April 1, 2007 for failing to comply with CLE requirements.Â  By order dated\r\n  June 6, 2007, this Court formally suspended Respondent and ordered her to\r\n  surrender her certificate to practice law in this state for her continued\r\n  failure to meet the CLE requirements.Â  \r\nOn October 6, 2009, ODC filed formal charges with the Commission alleging Respondent had committed\r\n  misconduct in six matters.Â  The formal charges were served on Respondent by certified\r\n  mail sent to her last two known addresses.Â  Â Â \r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to file an answer or otherwise respond to the formal charges, and a\r\n  Default Order was issued by the Commission.Â  The Hearing Panel subsequently conducted\r\n  a hearing on the formal charges to determine the appropriate, recommended\r\n  sanction, but Respondent did not appear and she was not represented by\r\n  counsel.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Hearing Panel found the allegations in the six matters were deemed admitted\r\n  pursuant to Rule 24(b) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement\r\n  (&quot;RLDE&quot;), contained in Rule 413, South Carolina Appellate Court Rules\r\n  (&quot;SCACR&quot;), as a result of Respondent's default.Â  The allegations, now\r\n  deemed admitted, are as follows.\r\nA.&nbsp; The E. Gault Matter\r\nMs. E. Gault consulted Respondent about possibly\r\n  filing for bankruptcy.Â  At that time, Respondent worked as an associate at the\r\n  Fleming Law Firm.Â  Respondent met with Gault and advised her that she should\r\n  not file for bankruptcy.Â  Respondent believed Gault left the meeting\r\n  considering whether to accept her advice.Â  The Fleming Law Firm collected\r\n  $610.00 from Gault, but Respondent did no work on the file and had no further\r\n  communication with Gault until after she left the Fleming Law Firm two months\r\n  later.Â  \r\nThe client files\r\n  Respondent took with her to her new practice were determined by Mr. Fleming.Â \r\n  Respondent did not take Gault's file.Â  When Gault contacted her several weeks\r\n  later, Respondent referred her to the Fleming Law Firm, but thereafter someone\r\n  from the firm delivered Gault's file to Respondent's new office.Â  Respondent\r\n  again reviewed the matter and advised Gault not to file for bankruptcy.\r\nGault continued to\r\n  call Respondent's office and, at one point, paid $110.00 to Respondent's\r\n  secretary.Â  Respondent failed to ensure that Gault understood her advice and failed\r\n  to take affirmative steps with Fleming to determine which files she was going\r\n  to handle after her departure.\r\nRespondent timely\r\n  responded to ODC's initial inquiry in this matter, but did not timely respond\r\n  to the notice of full investigation.\r\nB.&nbsp; The Malpass Matter\r\nRespondent was\r\n  appointed to represent Mr. Malpass in a criminal matter, and she appeared at a\r\n  hearing on his behalf.Â  Another individual, Ms. Moore, made numerous\r\n  unsuccessful attempts to contact Respondent by phone and in person at her\r\n  office on behalf of Malpass.Â  Respondent did not have permission from Malpass\r\n  to talk to Moore about his case; however, Respondent never consulted with Malpass\r\n  about whether he would give her permission to speak to Moore, despite Moore's\r\n  repeated inquiries.Â  \r\nRespondent was\r\n  placed on interim suspension while she was waiting for an evaluation to submit\r\n  to the court regarding Malpass's release.Â  She failed to turn over Malpass's\r\n  file to the attorney appointed to protect her clients' interests, and to date\r\n  Respondent has been unable to locate the file.\r\nRespondent\r\n  did not timely respond to the notice of full investigation in this matter.\r\nC.&nbsp; The Sloan Matter\r\nRespondent\r\n  conducted a real estate closing in December 2005 at which Mr. Sloan was the\r\n  borrower.Â  Respondent's paralegal miscalculated the payoff of Sloan's mortgage\r\n  and Respondent did not catch this error.Â  Sloan learned of this when he\r\n  received a notice from his mortgage company in January 2006.\r\nAfter Sloan was\r\n  unable to reach Respondent, he enlisted the assistance of the other party to\r\n  the transaction, who then contacted Respondent.Â  Respondent issued a check for\r\n  the correct amount to Sloan's lender.Â  Respondent made up the difference\r\n  resulting from her miscalculation from her attorney's fee.Â  \r\nRespondent did not\r\n  timely respond to the notice of full investigation in this matter.\r\nD.&nbsp; The T. Gault Matter\r\nRespondent represented Mr. T. Gault in a domestic\r\n  matter.Â  After the hearing, the judge instructed Respondent to prepare an\r\n  order.Â  Respondent prepared and submitted the order, which the judge signed\r\n  within eight days of the hearing.Â  The same week, Respondent suffered from a\r\n  serious medical episode.Â  She then closed her office and moved out of state.Â \r\n  The order was not actually filed until two and a half months after it was\r\n  signed. \r\nRespondent\r\n  did not take appropriate steps to notify Gault or the court about the closing\r\n  of her office and her departure from the state, or to protect Gault's interests\r\n  upon her unilateral termination of representation.Â  Respondent did not turn\r\n  Gault's file over to the attorney appointed to protect her clients' interests\r\n  and to date she has been unable to locate the file.\r\nE.&nbsp; The Canupp Matter\r\nMs. Canupp paid Respondent a $2,000.00 retainer in\r\n  December 2005 to represent her on a DUI charge.Â  Respondent represented to ODC\r\n  that she referred Canupp's case to Mr. Wood, an attorney who agreed to take her\r\n  cases when she closed her office.Â  Wood subsequently died, however, and\r\n  Respondent was unable to locate Canupp's file.\r\nRespondent has no\r\n  record of depositing Canupp's fee into her trust account or paying it to\r\n  attorney Wood, and she is unable to recall or document what she did with the\r\n  fee.Â  The Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection has reimbursed Canupp the full\r\n  amount of the fee she paid to Respondent.\r\nF.&nbsp; The Spoone Matter\r\nRespondent was\r\n  appointed to represent Mr. Spoone in a Department of Social Services\r\n  (&quot;DSS&quot;) matter.Â  At the time Respondent closed her office and left South Carolina in January 2006, a hearing had been scheduled for March 2006.Â  Respondent\r\n  did not seek to be relieved as counsel or take steps to protect Spoone's interests,\r\n  and she did not turn over Spoone's file to the attorney appointed to protect\r\n  her clients' interests while she was on interim suspension.Â  To date she has\r\n  been unable to locate Spoone's file.\r\nG.&nbsp; Hearing Panel's Findings of Misconduct\r\nThe Hearing Panel found that by her conduct,\r\n  Respondent was subject to sanctions for violating the following Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct (RPC) of Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (competence), Rule 1.2\r\n  (scope of representation), Rule 1.4 (communication with clients), Rule 1.5\r\n  (fees), Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property), Rule 1.16 (terminating\r\n  representation), and Rule 8.1 (failure to respond to disciplinary authority).\r\nThe\r\n  Hearing Panel further found Respondent is subject to discipline for violating\r\n  the following provisions of the RLDE contained in Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule\r\n  7(a)(1), RLDE (violating the RPC); Rule 7(a)(3), RLDE (knowing failure to\r\n  respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5), RLDE\r\n  (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice, tending\r\n  to bring the legal profession into disrepute, and demonstrating an unfitness to\r\n  practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6), RLDE (violating the Oath of Office taken upon\r\n  the admission to practice law in South Carolina).Â  \r\nH.&nbsp; Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances\r\nThe Hearing Panel took two aggravating factors into\r\n  consideration:Â  (1)&nbsp;Respondent failed to fully cooperate in the\r\n  disciplinary investigations, and (2) Respondent did not answer the formal\r\n  charges or appear at the hearing.Â  \r\nThe Hearing Panel\r\n  noted Respondent had failed to appear at the hearing to offer evidence in\r\n  mitigation, but that disciplinary counsel did report to the Hearing Panel &quot;that\r\n  Respondent had suffered a medical emergency and a subsequent domestic issue in\r\n  2005 and 2006 that interrupted her law practice and resulted in her leaving the\r\n  state unexpectedly.&quot; \r\nRespondent\r\n  did return to the state for a time and during one interval she cooperated in\r\n  the disciplinary investigation and was represented by counsel.Â  However, on\r\n  March 25, 2008 the Commission Chair granted counsel's motion to be relieved on\r\n  the ground that he had been unable to communicate with Respondent.Â  Respondent\r\n  corresponded with ODC in April 2008, but she did not appear in August 2008 as\r\n  required by an ODC subpoena and she has not contacted ODC since July 2008.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  of these circumstances, the Hearing Panel found that Respondent's alleged\r\n  &quot;medical condition and domestic issue do not mitigate the sanction in this\r\n  matter since she did not answer or appear to offer any evidence in that\r\n  regard.&quot;Â  The Hearing Panel did take into account, however, the fact that\r\n  Respondent has no disciplinary history.\r\nI.&nbsp; Hearing Panel's Recommended Sanction\r\nThe Hearing Panel recommended the sanction of\r\n  disbarment and that Respondent be ordered to pay the costs of these\r\n  proceedings.Â  The recommendation was based on the underlying misconduct,\r\n  Respondent's failure to fully cooperate in the disciplinary investigation, and\r\n  her failure to answer the formal charges and appear at the hearing.Â  By letter\r\n  of April 22, 2010 to this Court, the Commission reported the costs incurred amounted\r\n  to $411.69.\r\nThe\r\n  Hearing Panel also recommended that &quot;Respondent be ordered to reimburse\r\n  the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for any amount paid to clients as a\r\n  result of her misconduct prior to readmission to the practice of law.&quot;[1]Â  \r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nNeither Respondent nor ODC has filed a brief raising\r\n  any exceptions to the Panel Report.Â  In addition, as noted by the Hearing\r\n  Panel, Respondent did not answer the formal charges, for which she was deemed\r\n  in default, and she did not appear at the hearing on these matters.\r\n&quot;Failure\r\n  to answer the formal charges shall constitute an admission of the factual\r\n  allegations.&quot;Â  Rule 24(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  &quot;If the respondent\r\n  should fail to appear when specifically so ordered by the hearing panel or the\r\n  Supreme Court, the respondent shall be deemed to have admitted the factual\r\n  allegations which were to be the subject of such appearance and to have\r\n  conceded the merits of any motion or recommendations to be considered at such\r\n  appearance.&quot;Â  Id. Rule 24(b), RLDE.\r\n&quot;The authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline\r\n  is given rests entirely with this Court.&quot;Â  In re Tullis, 375 S.C.\r\n  190, 191, 652 S.E.2d 395, 395&nbsp;(2007).Â  The Court &quot;has the sole\r\n  authority . . . to decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of\r\n  the record.&quot;Â  In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401\r\n  (2000).Â  &quot;The Court is not bound by the panel's recommendation and may\r\n  make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.&quot;Â  In re Hazzard,\r\n  377 S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102, 106&nbsp;(2008).Â  \r\nA\r\n  disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  In\r\n    re Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see also Rule 8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall\r\n  be established by clear and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the\r\n  charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.&quot;).\r\nBased\r\n  on Rule 24 of the RLDE, the factual allegations against Respondent are deemed\r\n  admitted and we agree with disciplinary counsel that such acts constitute\r\n  misconduct.Â  Having found disciplinary counsel has met the burden of\r\n  establishing Respondent's misconduct by clear and convincing evidence, this\r\n  Court need only determine the appropriate sanction and whether to accept the\r\n  Hearing Panel's recommendation of disbarment.Â  See In re Jacobsen,&nbsp;386\r\n  S.C. 598, 606, 690 S.E.2d 560, 564&nbsp;(2010) (&quot;Because Respondent has\r\n  been found in default and, thus, is deemed to have admitted to all of the\r\n  factual allegations, the sole question before the Court is whether to accept\r\n  the Panel's recommended sanction.&quot;).Â  \r\nIn recommending\r\n  the sanction of disbarment for Respondent, the Hearing Panel cited to several\r\n  instances where attorneys were disbarred for failing to answer formal charges\r\n  or appear at a panel hearing in addition to committing other acts of\r\n  misconduct.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the first, In re Tullis, 375 S.C. 190, 652 S.E.2d 395 (2007), the\r\n  attorney failed to file an answer to the formal charges; therefore, he was in\r\n  default and the factual allegations were deemed admitted.Â  This Court observed the\r\n  attorney &quot;failed to adequately\r\n  communicate with his clients, failed to act with diligence and competence;\r\n  misused and mismanaged trust account funds; and failed to respond to\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel inquiries and notices of full investigation regarding\r\n  these matters.&quot;Â  Id. at 192, 652 S.E.2d at 396.Â  We noted the\r\n  attorney had an extensive disciplinary history, including a public reprimand\r\n  and a suspension.Â  Id. at 193 n.2, 652 S.E.2d at 396 n.2.Â  We held the\r\n  sanction of disbarment was justified and also ordered the attorney to make\r\n  $410.00 in restitution and pay the costs of the disciplinary proceeding.Â  Id. at 193-94, 652 S.E.2d at 396.\r\nIn\r\n  another case, In re Murph, 350 S.C. 1, 4-5, 564 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2002), we\r\n  stated the attorney's &quot;failure to\r\n  answer the formal charges and appear at the hearing before the sub-panel, when\r\n  coupled with his admission that he committed criminal acts, his failure to\r\n  respond to Disciplinary Counsel, the fact that he practiced law on two\r\n  occasions while on suspension, the fact that he has failed to earn or return\r\n  over $7,000 in fees, and his failure to represent clients\r\n  competently and diligently in numerous cases, warrants the severe sanction of\r\n  disbarment.&quot;\r\nThis\r\n  Court stated an attorney's failure to answer charges or appear to defend the\r\n  misconduct is to be accorded &quot;substantial weight&quot; and is likely to\r\n  result in &quot;the most severe sanctions&quot;:Â  \r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  attorney usually does not abandon a license to practice law without a fight. Â Those\r\n  who do must understand that &quot;neglecting to participate [in a disciplinary\r\n  proceeding] is entitled to substantial weight in determining the sanction.&quot;Â  \r\n\tIn the Matter of Sifly, 279 S.C. 113, 115, 302 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1983). Â An\r\n  attorney's failure to answer charges or appear to defend or explain alleged\r\n  misconduct indicates an obvious disinterest in the practice of law. Â Such an\r\n  attorney is likely to face the most severe sanctions because a central purpose\r\n  of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from unscrupulous or\r\n  indifferent lawyers.\r\n\r\nId. at 4, 564 S.E.2d at 675&nbsp;(quoting In re Hall,\r\n  333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998) (alteration in original)).\r\nIn\r\n  the case of In re Wofford, 330 S.C. 522, 500 S.E.2d 486 (1998), the\r\n  Court determined disbarment was appropriate where the attorney failed to answer\r\n  the formal charges or appear at the panel hearing or the hearing before this\r\n  Court (and thus was deemed to have admitted the factual allegations in the\r\n  charges), failed to provide competent representation, failed to keep clients\r\n  reasonably informed, misappropriated client funds, and committed criminal acts.\r\nIn\r\n  the current matter, Respondent's abandonment of her law practice without appropriate\r\n  regard for the interests of her clients, and her subsequent misconduct in\r\n  failing to answer the formal charges, failing to submit to ODC's subpoena, and\r\n  failing to appear at the hearing convened by the Hearing Panel, as well as her\r\n  continued failure to participate in the disciplinary process, warrant her\r\n  disbarment.\r\nRespondent\r\n  has not communicated with ODC for over two years and, according to an\r\n  investigator with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), she has\r\n  left the state.Â  At this point, the only facts that are certain are that\r\n  Respondent has abandoned her clients and her law practice in this state and the\r\n  reasons for this conduct have not been substantiated.Â  Respondent has presented\r\n  no evidence in mitigation at any stage of this proceeding.\r\nIn\r\n  the case of In re Okpalaeke, 374 S.C. 186, 648 S.E.2d 593 (2007), the\r\n  attorney was aware formal charges were being brought against him, but he left\r\n  the state and apparently had no intention of returning (the last entry on his\r\n  passport was Amsterdam, Holland).Â  This Court noted the charges against the\r\n  attorney described approximately nine acts of misconduct, including failing to\r\n  properly disburse settlement money, threatening criminal prosecution to gain\r\n  advantage in a civil matter, and systematically failing to properly oversee and\r\n  fulfill the financial obligations of his law practice.Â  This Court accepted the\r\n  Hearing Panel's recommendation of disbarment, stating Respondent had\r\n  &quot;shown no regard for the status of his license to practice law in South\r\n  Carolina&quot;:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e\r\n  agree with the Panel's finding that Respondent's conduct indicates an obvious\r\n  disinterest in the practice of law. Â By all accounts, Respondent has left this\r\n  jurisdiction with no apparent intention of returning. Â Respondent departed this\r\n  jurisdiction with the knowledge that disciplinary action against him was\r\n  imminent, and since his departure, Respondent has shown no regard for the status of\r\n  his license to practice law in South Carolina. Â As this Court has noted, a\r\n  central purpose of the attorney disciplinary process is\r\n  to protect the public from unscrupulous or indifferent lawyers.Â  In re Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998). Â Furthermore, we have disbarred attorneys who fail to answer\r\n  formal charges or appear at hearings before the Panel or this Court in egregious\r\n  cases.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 194, 648 S.E.2d at 597-98 (footnote omitted).\r\nIII.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we agree with the Hearing Panel's recommended sanction of disbarment.Â \r\n  This is warranted based on Respondent's abandonment of her law practice and other\r\n  acts of misconduct.Â  Having found Respondent has committed sanctionable\r\n  misconduct, we hold she is required to pay the costs of these proceedings and\r\n  to reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for any amounts paid to\r\n  clients on her behalf, as recommended by the Hearing Panel.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Disciplinary counsel noted at the hearing in this\r\n  matter that the Fund has reimbursed Canupp the $2,000.00 that Respondent could\r\n  not account for, and it has also &quot;paid some other claims, but they are not\r\n  related to these complainants.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26894","title":"Nelson v.

Nelson, both of Greenwood, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tChristopher\r\n  D. Florian, of SC Department of Corrections, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Â Petitioner pled guilty to criminal domestic violence, third or\r\n  subsequent offense (CDV 3rd).Â  Petitioner filed this action in the\r\n  Court's original jurisdiction seeking a writ of mandamus directing respondent\r\n  to apply good time and earned work credits to reduce the actual time petitioner\r\n  must serve.Â  We find inmates convicted of CDV 3rd are required to\r\n  actually be imprisoned for a mandatory one-year minimum.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nOn January 20, 2010, petitioner pled\r\n  guilty to two counts of CDV 3rd and was sentenced to concurrent\r\n  terms of fifteen monthsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  The sentencing judge ordered petitioner\r\n  be given credit for 162 days of pre-sentencing detention, as petitioner had\r\n  been incarcerated since August 11, 2009.Â  The South Carolina Department of\r\n  Corrections (SCDC) projected petitioner would be eligible for release one year\r\n  after he was originally incarcerated.Â  \r\nOn May\r\n  6, 2010, petitionerâ€™s counsel wrote SCDC director Jon Ozmint requesting SCDC\r\n  reevaluate its interpretation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-25-20(B)(3) (Supp. 2009),\r\n  which provides the punishment for CDV 3rd.Â  SCDC responded,\r\n  explaining it interpreted the statute to mean petitioner was required to\r\n  actually serve one year, not including good time credits[1] or earned work credits,[2] before he was eligible for release.\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes Â§ 16-25-20(B)(3) require an inmate\r\n  serving a mandatory minimum one-year sentence for CDV 3rd to\r\n  actually be imprisoned for one year?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA.Â  Threshold Issues\r\nAt the\r\n  outset, we note petitioner was released from SCDC in August, 2010, making his\r\n  underlying claim moot.Â  See Sloan v. Dep't of Transp., 379 S.C.\r\n  160, 167, 666 S.E.2d 236, 240 (2008) (This Court &quot;will not pass on moot\r\n  and academic questions or make an adjudication where there remains no actual\r\n  controversy.&quot;).Â  If, however, an issue raised is capable of repetition but\r\n  generally will evade review, the Court can address the issue.Â  Id.Â  We\r\n  find this issue is one that is capable of repetition, yet will usually evade\r\n  review because most inmates will have served the year required by SCDC's\r\n  interpretation of the statute before the lawfulness of the interpretation can\r\n  be reviewed.\r\nWe therefore construe this as an action for a declaratory judgment.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-53-30\r\n  (2005) (a party whose rights, status, and other legal relations are affected by\r\n  a statute may seek a court's determination of any question of construction or\r\n  validity of the statute and obtain a declaration of the party's rights, status,\r\n  or other legal relations thereunder); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-53-130 (2005)\r\n  (purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to settle and to afford relief from\r\n  uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status and other legal\r\n  relations, and it is to be liberally construed and administered); Town of\r\n    Hilton Head Island v. Coalition of Expressway Opponents, 307 S.C. 449, 415\r\n  S.E.2d 801 (1992) (the Supreme Court can render a declaratory judgment when a\r\n  justiciable controversy setting legal rights of parties exists).\r\nB.Â  Statutory\r\n  Interpretation\r\n\r\n\tS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-20\r\n  provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\t(B)Â Â Â  [A] person who violates the\r\n  provisions of subsection (A) is guilty of the offense of criminal domestic\r\n  violence and, upon conviction, must be punished as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1)&nbsp; for a first offense,\r\n  the person is guilty of a\tmisdemeanor and must be fined . . . or\r\n  imprisoned not more than thirty days.Â  The court may suspend the imposition or\r\n  execution of all or part of the fine conditioned upon the offender\r\n  completing . . . a program designed to treat batterers.\r\n(2)&nbsp; for a second offense,\r\n  the person is guilty of a  misdemeanor and must be fined . . . and\r\n  imprisoned not less than a mandatory minimum of thirty days nor more than one\r\n  year.Â  The court may suspend the imposition or execution of all or part of the\r\n  sentence, except the thirty-day mandatory minimum sentence, conditioned upon\r\n  the offender completing . . . a program designed to treat batterers.Â  If a\r\n    person is sentenced to a mandatory minimum of thirty days pursuant to the\r\n    provisions of this subsection, the judge may provide that the sentence be\r\n    served two days during the week or on weekends until the sentence is completed\r\n    and is eligible for early release based on credits he is able to earn\r\n      during the service of his sentence, including but not limited to, good-time\r\n      credits;\r\n(3)&nbsp; for a third offense, the person is\r\n  guilty of a felony and must be imprisoned not less than a mandatory minimum\r\n    of one year but not more than five years.\r\n\t\r\n\t(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues inmates convicted of CDV 3rd should\r\n  be permitted to earn good time credits and earned work credits such that they\r\n  could reduce their terms of actual imprisonment below the mandatory minimum of\r\n  one year.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and\r\n  give effect to the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Bryant v. State, 384\r\n  S.C. 525, 529, 683 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009).Â  When a statute is penal in nature,\r\n  it must be strictly construed against the State and in favor of the defendant.Â  \r\nState v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991).Â \r\n  However, all rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that\r\n  the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the\r\n  language used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended\r\n  purpose of the statute.Â  State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 351, 688 S.E.2d\r\n  569, 575 (2010).\r\nWe find the legislature intended Â§ 16-25-20(B)(3) to require\r\n  inmates convicted of CDV 3rd to actually be imprisoned for the\r\n  mandatory one-year minimum.Â  The legislature expressly provided that an inmate\r\n  convicted of CDV, second offense, who is sentenced to the mandatory minimum term\r\n  of imprisonment is eligible for early release based on credits he is able to\r\n  earn during the service of his sentence.Â  We find that, by omitting such\r\n  language from the provision at issue, the legislature intended to make an\r\n  inmate convicted of CDV 3rd ineligible to receive good time and earned\r\n  work credits to reduce the time they are required to serve below the mandatory\r\n  minimum of one year.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 86, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 582 (2000) (the canon of construction &quot;expressio unius est\r\n    exclusio alterius&quot; or &quot;inclusio unius est exclusio alterius&quot;\r\n  holds that â€œto express or include one thing implies the exclusion of another,\r\n  or of the alternative&quot;). \r\nPetitioner\r\n  contends State v. Thomas, 372 S.C. 466, 642 S.E.2d 724 (2007) provides\r\n  guidance on this issue.Â  In Thomas, the Court held the sentencing judge\r\n  retained the power to suspend the sentence of a defendant convicted of\r\n  distribution of crack cocaine within a certain proximity to a school because\r\n  the applicable penalty statute contained no provision restricting a sentencing\r\n  judge from suspending the minimum sentence.Â  Thomas is\r\n  distinguishable from the present case because Thomas addresses the\r\n  general power of courts to suspend a sentence whereas the present case\r\n  addresses the mandatory application by SCDC of Â§ 16-25-20(B)(3) when\r\n  calculating the time an inmate must actually be imprisoned.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find the absence of a provision restricting SCDC from applying good time and\r\n  earned work credits to reduce an inmate's sentence below the mandatory minimum\r\n  does not indicate SCDC must apply these credits in such a way.\r\n\r\n\tCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find\r\n  Â§ 16-25-20(B)(3) requires inmates convicted of CDV 3rd to actually\r\n  be imprisoned for the mandatory minimum of one year.\r\nJUDGMENT FOR RESPONDENT.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n[1] See S.C.

Keyes is the sole shareholder of both corporations.Â  \r\nIn 1996, a group\r\n  including Franz Auer, John E. Peterson, Jr., and Bruce O. Rossmeyer (&quot;Investors&quot;)[1] desired to\r\n  purchase the restaurant business and the real property where it is situated.Â \r\n  After extensive negotiations, during which the parties were represented by\r\n  counsel, the Investors reached an agreement with Keyes for a multi-stage\r\n  transfer structured over a period of three to five years.Â  \r\nOn November 25, 1996, the Investors formally entered\r\n  into an &quot;Asset Acquisition Agreement&quot; (&quot;Asset Agreement&quot;)\r\n  with MMK to purchase the operating assets of the restaurant owned by MMK,\r\n  including its business equipment and related personal property, trade name, phone\r\n  number, and goodwill.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Investors were to take possession of the premises on December 2, 1996 and\r\n  continue operating the restaurant as an ongoing enterprise.Â  The closing date\r\n  for the asset purchase was initially set to occur in three years, on December\r\n  1, 1999, with the Investors having the right to postpone the closing for two\r\n  additional, one-year periods by giving MMK written notice of their intent to do\r\n  so 90 days prior to the initial closing date or the end of a renewal term.Â \r\n  Thus, the latest date for closing on the asset purchase would be in five years,\r\n  on December 1, 2001.\r\nIn a\r\n  separate document, the Investors executed an assignment of their rights under\r\n  the Asset Agreement to their newly-formed corporation, Alexander's Restaurant\r\n  Co., Inc. (&quot;Buyer&quot;), which was established to run the restaurant.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Asset Agreement incorporated several exhibits that were expressly stated to be\r\n  &quot;an integral part of this Agreement&quot;:Â  (1) a &quot;Personal Property\r\n  Lease&quot; between the Buyer and MMK regarding some of the restaurant assets;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;a &quot;Sublease Agreement (Including Option)&quot; by which the Buyer\r\n  subleased the restaurant premises from MMK (which held the original lease with\r\n  the Seller); and (3) a &quot;Restated Commercial Lease (Including Option)&quot;\r\n  directly between the Seller and the Buyer that was not executed at that time\r\n  since it was to take effect only after the closing on the sale of the business\r\n  assets. \r\nAs\r\n  part of the original transaction, the Seller granted the Buyer an option to\r\n  purchase the real property.Â  It appears as Paragraph 22.16 in both the Sublease\r\n  and the Restated Commercial Lease.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Sublease Agreement between the Buyer and MMK was effective December 1, 1996.Â \r\n  The Sublease stated MMK had a commercial lease with the Seller for use of the\r\n  restaurant premises, and MMK was subleasing the property to the Buyer for a\r\n  three-year term ending November 30, 1999, with the option of two, one-year\r\n  renewal terms, the same as the terms of the Asset Agreement.Â  The Sublease\r\n  required the Buyer to extend the closing date of the asset purchase in order to\r\n  extend the Sublease.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Sublease provided the Buyer with an option to purchase the real property where\r\n  the restaurant is located (including a 5,800 square foot building) at a cost of\r\n  $1,650,000.00.Â  As a condition precedent to exercise of the option, the Buyer\r\n  was required to &quot;have consummated the purchase of [MMK's] business&quot;\r\n  and to have paid all amounts due to MMK under the Asset Agreement and the\r\n  Personal Property Lease.Â  The option to purchase provided as follows:\r\n\r\n\t22.16Â  Option to Purchase.Â  Subject to the condition precedent set forth below,\r\n  the LANDLORD [the Seller] grants to SUBTENANT [the Buyer], during the first and\r\n  second renewal term [an] option to purchase (the &quot;Option&quot;) the\r\n  Premises upon the following terms and conditions:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a)Â \r\n  A purchase price of ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND NO/00 [dollars] ($1,650,000.00).\r\n\t\t(b)Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  Option must be exercised in writing not later than ninety (90) days prior to\r\n  the end of the second renewal term and not earlier than ninety (90) days prior\r\n  to the commencement of the first renewal term.Â  Failure to exercise the option\r\n  shall cause it to automatically expire without further action by LANDLORD [the\r\n  Seller].\r\n\t\t(c)Â Â Â Â  Upon\r\n  the exercise of the Option, SUBTENANT [the Buyer] shall deposit an earnest\r\n  money deposit with LANDLORD [the Seller] in an amount equal to FORTY-ONE\r\n  THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND NO/00 [dollars] ($41,250.00) representing TWO\r\n  AND ONE/HALF PERCENT (2.5%) of the purchase price.\r\n\t\t(d)Â Â Â Â  Closing\r\n  shall occur within ninety (90) days from the date of exercise of the Option.\r\n\t\t.\r\n  . . . \r\n\t\r\n\tAs\r\n  a condition precedent to the exercise of this Option, SUBTENANT [the Buyer]\r\n  must have consummated the purchase of TENANT'S [MMK's] business, pursuant to\r\n  the terms and conditions of the Asset Acquisition Agreement (Exhibit\r\n    &quot;B&quot;).Â  In addition, it is explicitly recognized that this Option\r\n  can not [sic] be exercised until TENANT [MMK] has received all amounts owed to\r\n  it under the Asset Acquisition Agreement and the Personal Property Lease.[2]Â  \r\n\r\nB.&nbsp; Dispute Concerning\r\n  OptionÂ  \r\nThe\r\n  Buyer operated the restaurant under the parties' agreements for five years, from\r\n  1996 to 2001, by exercising both of the one-year extensions.Â  In early to\r\n  mid-2001, discussions began whereby the Buyer proposed delaying the closing of\r\n  the asset purchase and extending the asset lease, while closing on the purchase\r\n  of the real property first.Â  No formal agreements were ever reached in this\r\n  regard, however.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 9, 2001, the Buyer's attorney wrote to the Seller's attorney and stated\r\n  the Buyer proposed purchasing the land in December and delaying closing on the\r\n  business assets for another four years.Â  He asked the Seller's attorney to &quot;let\r\n  [him] know if this is acceptable.&quot;Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 14, 2001, the Seller's attorney responded to the Buyer's attorney and noted,\r\n  &quot;The original agreement between our respective clients has always provided\r\n  that the option for the real estate could not be exercised until the business\r\n  was acquired.Â  That is still the underlying premise.&quot;Â  The Seller's\r\n  attorney then stated, &quot;There would not be a difficulty in extending the\r\n  business acquisition/leases for an agreeable period of time and, at the same\r\n  time, we could also consider extending the option to purchase under mutually\r\n  agreeable terms.&quot;Â  The Seller's attorney advised that his client would be\r\n  away for a few weeks and cautioned the Buyer's attorney to speak to the Buyer\r\n  and get back to him soon, noting:Â  &quot;Please keep in mind that there are\r\n  deadlines for these matters.&quot;Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 27, 2001, the Buyer's attorney wrote to the Seller's attorney in a document\r\n  entitled, &quot;Speed Memo,&quot; about exercising the option:\r\n\r\n\tThis confirms our recent phone conversations.Â  Ric\r\n  [John &quot;Rick&quot; Peterson, one of the Investors] and his partners will\r\n  exercise option on property and we would like to follow-up on Ric &amp; Rogers\r\n  [Rodger Keyes] recent conversation about extending remainder for 3-5 yrs.Â  \r\n\r\nNo\r\n  agreements were reached by the parties by September 1, 2001.Â  The Buyer did not\r\n  pay the earnest money deposit of $41,250.00 at any time prior to September 1,\r\n  2001 and did not close on the purchase of the business assets by that date.Â Â Â  \r\nBy\r\n  letter of September 5, 2001, the Seller's attorney advised the Buyer's attorney\r\n  that the option to purchase the real property had expired on September 1,\r\n  2001.Â  The Seller's attorney stated no notice had been received about the\r\n  exercise of the option; further, since there were no extensions in the purchase\r\n  date for the business assets, the closing date would be December 1, 2001 as\r\n  contemplated by the parties' agreements, at which point &quot;the Sublease\r\n  would convert to a Lease.&quot;Â  The Seller's attorney stated Rodger Keyes was\r\n  out of town, so he had not had a chance to talk to him, and he (the attorney)\r\n  would be leaving the country for a couple of weeks.Â  The attorney acknowledged\r\n  that there had been some discussions about extending the closing on the\r\n  purchase of the business and stated there may be a possibility of extending the\r\n  option under revised terms, but that the Seller's position at that time was\r\n  that it was &quot;looking to a closing of the business on December 1st, and\r\n  that the option for the purchase of the real estate has expired.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  parties met again after this, but still failed to reach an agreement.Â  On or\r\n  about November 15, 2001, the Buyer tendered to the Seller the earnest money\r\n  deposit of $41,250.00 required by Paragraph 22.16 of the Sublease, but the\r\n  Seller returned the funds, reiterating its position that the option to purchase\r\n  the real property had expired.Â  \r\n\r\nC.&nbsp; Suit for Specific\r\n  Performance Â \r\nIn late November 2001, the Buyer and Alexander's Land Co., L.L.C.[3],\r\n  along with the individuals comprising them, brought the current action against\r\n  the Seller, MMK, and Rodger Keyes seeking specific performance of the option to\r\n  purchase the real property.Â  They contended the Speed Memo of August 27, 2001\r\n  was a valid exercise of the option.\r\nThe\r\n  Buyer thereafter closed on the purchase of the restaurant assets from MMK on\r\n  December 7, 2001.Â  At that time, the Restated Commercial Lease was executed, so\r\n  the Buyer now leases the real property directly from the Seller and continues\r\n  to operate the restaurant with the assets it purchased from MMK.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the circuit court issued an order denying the Buyer's request for\r\n  specific performance.Â  The circuit court stated the evidence showed the\r\n  Investorsâ€”Auer, Peterson, and Rossmeyerâ€”attempted to exercise the option on\r\n  behalf of the Buyer by delivering the written notice on August 27, 2001.Â  However,\r\n  the delivery of the notice, standing alone, was not sufficient to comply with\r\n  the terms of the option, which required:Â  (1)&nbsp;closing on the acquisition\r\n  of the business assets prior to the exercise of the option, (2)&nbsp;delivery\r\n  of the written notice, and (3) tender of the $41,250.00 earnest money deposit.\r\n  The circuit court found &quot;Auer, Peterson and Rossmeyer did not satisfy the\r\n  condition precedent by actually closing on their acquisition of the Business\r\n  Assets, and they did not tender the earnest money deposit along with the written\r\n  notice of the [Buyer's desire to exercise the] Option.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the matter for an order enforcing the\r\n  option, holding that, except for failing to meet the condition precedent, the\r\n  Buyer had properly exercised the option; therefore, the Seller should have\r\n  given the Buyer notice of default and the right to cure the default within\r\n  thirty days as contemplated by the parties' agreements.Â  Alexander's Land\r\n    Co. v. M&amp;M&amp;K Corp., Op. No. 2007-UP-364 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Aug.\r\n  29, 2007).Â  This Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to review\r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nII.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  suit seeking a declaratory\r\n  judgment is neither legal nor equitable; rather, it is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Sloan v. Greenville Hosp. Sys.,\r\n  388 S.C. 152, 694 S.E.2d 532 (2010).Â  An action for specific performance of an\r\n  option contract lies in equity.Â  Ingram v.

Â Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d\r\n  773 (1976).\r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, the Seller[4] presents the following questions:Â  (1)&nbsp;whether the Buyer properly\r\n  exercised the option to purchase the real property owned by the Seller, and (2)\r\n  whether the Buyer's failure to comply with the terms of the option was an\r\n  &quot;event of default&quot; that required the Seller to give the Buyer notice\r\n  of default and a right to cure its failure to comply with the terms of the\r\n  option.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Exercise of the Option\r\nAs\r\n  indicated above, the Seller granted the Buyer an option to purchase the real\r\n  property during the first and second renewal terms.Â  Specifically, Paragraph\r\n  22.16(b) provided:Â  &quot;The Option must be exercised in writing not later\r\n  than ninety (90) days prior to the end of the second renewal term and not\r\n  earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of the first renewal\r\n  term.Â  Failure to exercise the option shall cause it to automatically expire\r\n  without further action by LANDLORD [the Seller].&quot;Â  \r\nParagraph 22.16(c)\r\n  further provided for the payment of a deposit:Â  &quot;Upon the exercise of the\r\n  Option, SUBTENANT [the Buyer] shall deposit an earnest money deposit with\r\n  LANDLORD in an amount equal to . . . ($41,250.00) representing . . . (2.5%) of\r\n  the purchase price.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  option expressly required, as a condition precedent, that the Buyer complete\r\n  the purchase of MMK's business assets before it could exercise the\r\n  option.[5] Specifically, it provided the Buyer &quot;must have consummated the purchase of\r\n  [MMK's] business, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Asset Acquisition\r\n  Agreement&quot; and that the option could not be exercised until MMK &quot;has\r\n  received all amounts owed to it under the Asset Acquisition Agreement and the\r\n  Personal Property Lease.&quot;\r\nIn\r\n  denying the Buyer's request for specific performance, the circuit court ruled\r\n  the Buyer's attempt to exercise the option via the August 27, 2001 Speed Memo,\r\n  standing alone, was not exact compliance with the terms of the option as is\r\n  required under South Carolina law.Â  The circuit court stated the Buyer failed\r\n  to satisfy the condition precedent by closing on the purchase of the business\r\n  assets prior to attempting to exercise the option, and it also did not tender\r\n  the earnest money along with its written notice.Â Â Â  \r\nIn contrast, the\r\n  Court of Appeals held the option was properly exercised, but for the\r\n  satisfaction of the condition precedent.Â  Alexander's Land Co., slip.\r\n  op. at 8.Â  The Court of Appeals held the option did not require that the\r\n  payment of the deposit be contemporaneous with the exercise of the option.Â  Id. at 8.Â  The court determined the option was &quot;arranged as a time-table,\r\n  first requiring an exercise of the option, then a deposit of earnest money, and\r\n  finally a closing.&quot;[6]Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nOn appeal, the\r\n  Seller first contends the Court of Appeals erred in finding the Buyer properly\r\n  exercised the option, but for the satisfaction of the condition precedent.Â  The\r\n  Seller argues the Speed Memo of August 27, 2001 was not an unqualified exercise\r\n  of the option because the Buyer stated that it &quot;will&quot; exercise the\r\n  option, which the Seller asserts is &quot;an equivocal statement about a future\r\n  event.&quot;[7]Â \r\n  Also, in the Speed Memo, the Buyer &quot;again tried to negotiate a waiver of\r\n  the condition precedent, despite [the] Seller's repeated refusal to do so\r\n  during the preceding months.&quot;Â  The Seller argues that, &quot;in failing to\r\n  satisfy the condition precedent before the end of the option period,&quot; the\r\n  Buyer failed to strictly comply with the exact terms of the option.Â  The Seller\r\n  maintains the Buyer's attempted exercise of the option &quot;was not the\r\n  unequivocal and unconditional acceptance and performance required by South\r\n  Carolina law.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response, the Buyer maintains it properly noticed the option and that it does\r\n  not believe there was a failure of a condition precedent.Â  The Buyer argues it\r\n  was required to give notice that it would purchase the real property by\r\n  September 1, 2001, and then tender a deposit and be ready to close on the\r\n  business assets by December 1, 2001, all of which it complied with in a timely\r\n  manner.Â  The Buyer states it understood that it was required to close on the\r\n  purchase of the business assets before being allowed to close on the real\r\n  property, but it had believed both closings would be held on the same day.Â  The\r\n  Buyer maintains that if there was any misunderstanding regarding these\r\n  deadlines, it should have been given notice of default and a right to cure.Â  \r\nOptions\r\n  are contracts that generally possess the following three main characteristics:\r\n\r\n\t(1) they are unilateral contracts where the optionor,\r\n  for a valuable consideration, grants the optionee a right to make a contract of\r\n  purchase but does not bind the optionee to do so; (2) they are continuing\r\n  offers to sell, irrevocable during the option period; and (3) the transition of\r\n  an option into a contract of purchase and sale can only be effected by an\r\n  unqualified and unconditional acceptance of the offer in accordance with the\r\n  terms and within the time specified in the option contract.\r\n\r\nIngram, 340 S.C. at 108,\r\n  531 S.E.2d at 292; see also S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Hartough,\r\n  375 S.C. 541, 547, 654 S.E.2d 87, 90&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007) (citing the\r\n  three-part test in Ingram).\r\n&quot;In\r\n  equity, strict compliance with time limits contained in a contract will not\r\n  ordinarily be enforced, except with regard to option contracts.&quot;Â  Faulkner\r\n    v. Millar,&nbsp;319 S.C. 216, 220, 460 S.E.2d 378, 380&nbsp;(1995) (citing Dargan\r\n      v. Page, 222 S.C. 520, 73 S.E.2d 705 (1952)).\r\nWhen\r\n  an option is subject to a condition precedent, in addition to manifesting\r\n  acceptance within the stated time, the optionee must satisfy the conditions,\r\n  and the contract will not be specifically enforced until any such conditions\r\n  are met.Â  25 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts Â§ 67:84 (4th ed.\r\n  2002).\r\n&quot;It\r\n  is well settled in South Carolina that option contracts are strictly construed\r\n  in favor of the optionor and against the optionee.&quot;Â  Ingram, 340\r\n  S.C. at 108, 531 S.E.2d at 292.Â  &quot;Furthermore, if the option requires\r\n  performance in a certain manner, time is of the essence and exact compliance\r\n  with the terms of the option are required.&quot;Â  Id.Â  An expired and\r\n  unexercised option contract is essentially an unaccepted offer.Â  S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Transp. v. Hood, 381 S.C. 318, 672 S.E.2d 595 (Ct. App. 2009). \r\nThe Buyer's\r\n  purported exercise of the option was not in accordance with the terms mandated\r\n  by the option.Â  Although the use of the word &quot;will&quot; in the Buyer's\r\n  notice is not fatal, we agree with the circuit court's reasoning that the\r\n  option expressly required, as a condition precedent, that the Buyer actually\r\n  close on the purchase of MMK's business assets, i.e., that it &quot;consummate\r\n  the purchase of [MMK's] business&quot; and pay MMK &quot;all amounts owed to it\r\n  under the Asset Acquisition Agreement and the Personal Property Lease,&quot; before it had the right to exercise the option.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Buyer's failure to meet the condition precedent of closing on the business\r\n  assets clearly did not constitute proper and unequivocal compliance with the\r\n  explicit terms of the option prior to the time the option expired on its face.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  is stated in Ingram, &quot;an unqualified and unconditional acceptance\r\n  of the offer in accordance with the terms and within the time specified in the\r\n  option contract&quot; is required.Â  Ingram, 340 S.C. at 108, 531 S.E.2d at\r\n  292.Â  &quot;If a contract contains a condition precedent, that condition must\r\n  either occur or it must be excused before a party's duty to perform\r\n  arises.&quot;Â  McGill v. Moore, 381 S.C. 179, 187, 672 S.E.2d 571, 575&nbsp;(2009).Â \r\n  &quot;A condition precedent is an act which must occur before performance by\r\n  the other party is due.&quot;Â  Wood v. Roy Lapidus, Inc., 413 N.E.2d\r\n  345, 348 n.5 (Mass. App. Ct. 1980). \r\nSince\r\n  the Buyer never satisfied the condition precedent, and there is no evidence\r\n  that this failure was ever excused by the Seller, the Buyer was not entitled to\r\n  exercise the option, and no duty arose on the part of the Seller to convey the\r\n  real property.Â  See 92 C.J.S. Vendor and Purchaser Â§ 111 (2000)\r\n  (&quot;An option must be accepted according to its terms and if, by its terms,\r\n  it prescribes certain conditions for its acceptance, such conditions must be\r\n  performed while the option is still outstanding, unless they are waived or compliance is made impossible\r\n  by the optioner.&quot; (footnotes omitted)); id. Â§&nbsp;112\r\n  (&quot;Ordinarily, or normally, time is of the essence of an option contract\r\n  relating to land, whether or not so expressed, the optioner being bound only\r\n  during the time specified for the election to accept the option.&quot;\r\n  (footnotes omitted)); Cotter v. James L. Tapp Co.,&nbsp;267 S.C. 647,\r\n  656, 230 S.E.2d 715, 719&nbsp;(1976) (&quot;[T]he courts have recognized that\r\n  harsh results in option cases are necessary to further more compelling\r\n  considerations of public policy.Â  When an individual grants an option he ties\r\n  up his rights and property for a specified period of time without binding the\r\n  other side.Â  For this reason he is entitled to strict compliance with time\r\n  limits and other terms of the option.Â  Thus, if the optionee fails to comply\r\n  with the terms of the option, even though he may have an excuse, he must bear\r\n  the responsibility and not the optionor.&quot; (citation omitted)); cf. Kennedy\r\n    v. Gardner, 611 S.E.2d 480 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005) (holding if a party fails\r\n  to satisfy a condition precedent within the specified time for exercising an\r\n  option, the right is lost and cannot be revived by the unilateral act of the\r\n  party seeking to enforce the option).\r\nB.&nbsp; Default ProvisionÂ  \r\nThe\r\n  Seller next contends the Court of Appeals erred in further concluding that when\r\n  the Buyer failed to satisfy the condition precedent of closing on the business,\r\n  the Seller &quot;should have given [the Buyer] notice of default and the thirty\r\n  day right to cure period provided under Paragraph 16.1(f) of the\r\n  Sublease.&quot;Â  Alexander's Restaurant Co., slip op. at 9-10.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reaching its conclusion that the Buyer had a right to cure, the Court of\r\n  Appeals explained, &quot;Reading the default provisions of the Sublease indicates\r\n  a clear understanding that a failure of a condition precedent would be\r\n  considered a default.&quot;Â  Id. at 9.Â  The court relied upon Paragraph\r\n  22.17 of the Sublease, which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\t22.17Â  A material breach or default, as well as a\r\n  failure of condition precedent, with respect to the obligation by any party or\r\n  its assigns and guarantors to perform under this Sublease shall be a breach or\r\n  default under the Asset Acquisition Agreement (Exhibit &quot;B&quot;)\r\n  and Personal Property Lease (Exhibit &quot;C&quot;).Â  A material breach\r\n  or a default, as well as a failure of condition precedent, with respect by any\r\n  party to perform under the Asset Acquisition Agreement or under the Personal\r\n  Property Lease shall be a breach or a default under this Sublease.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals noted there were only two conditions precedent mentioned in\r\n  the Subleaseâ€”one in the option to purchase (Paragraph 22.16) and the other in\r\n  Paragraph 2 regarding the term of the lease and renewals.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  court stated, &quot;A failure of either condition precedent noted above is a\r\n  default under the Sublease, as provided for under Paragraph 22.17 of the\r\n  Sublease.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nHaving found the\r\n  failure of a condition precedent was a default, the Court of Appeals next found\r\n  it was subject to a right to cure as referenced in Paragraph 16.1(f) of the\r\n  Sublease, governing defaults by the Subtenant, i.e., the Buyer:\r\n\r\n\t16.1 Default by SUBTENANT.Â  Upon the occurrence\r\n  of any one or more of the following events, and the expiration of the\r\n  applicable period herein provided for the curing of such event, without notice,\r\n  if no notice is required, or with the required notice, then there shall be an\r\n  &quot;Event of Default&quot;:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tÂ . . . .\r\n\t\t(f)Â  If SUBTENANT fails in the performance of any of\r\n  the other covenants or conditions hereof and fails to cure such non-performance\r\n  within thirty (30) days after the receipt of written notice from TENANT\r\n  specifying the non-performance.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n&quot;The cardinal\r\n  rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to the\r\n  parties' intentions as determined by the contract language.&quot;Â  McGill,\r\n  381 S.C. at 185, 672 S.E.2d at 574.Â  &quot;Where the contract's language is\r\n  clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contract's force and\r\n  effect.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;A contract is read as a whole document so that\r\n  one may not create an ambiguity by pointing out a single sentence or clause.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;It is a question of law for the court whether the language of\r\n  a contract is ambiguous.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  examining the language of the default provision cited above, the pertinent\r\n  language expressly refers to an &quot;obligation . . . to perform under&quot;\r\n  the contract:Â  &quot;A material breach or default, as well as a failure of\r\n  condition precedent, with respect to the obligation by any party or its\r\n  assigns and guarantors to perform under this Sublease shall be a breach\r\n  or default under the Asset Acquisition Agreement [] and Personal\r\n    Property Lease [].&quot;Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  Along similar lines, it states\r\n  that a material breach or default, as well as the failure of a condition\r\n  precedent as to an obligation under the Asset Agreement and the Personal\r\n  Property Lease, shall constitute the same under the Sublease.\r\nWe\r\n  find Paragraph 22.17 simply states that a material breach or default, as well\r\n  as the failure of a condition precedent under the Sublease, will be considered a\r\n  breach, default, or failure of condition precedent under each of the other agreements\r\n  (the Asset Agreement and the Personal Property Lease), and vice versa.Â  It is a\r\n  cross-default provision that binds all three agreements by making the violation\r\n  of any one agreement a violation of all three.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the option to purchase was not a legal obligation of the Buyer to perform under\r\n  any of the contracts; rather, it was a right possessed by the Buyer to purchase\r\n  the real property at a certain price within a specified time frame.Â  If the\r\n  Buyer failed to proceed with the purchase for any reason, the Buyer was not in\r\n  default or breach, as the Buyer had no legal obligation under the contract to\r\n  purchase the real property.Â  Although the contract specifies a condition\r\n  precedent to the right to exercise the option, this is distinguishable\r\n  from a condition precedent related to any obligation to perform under\r\n  the contract.Â  \r\nIn Faulkner\r\n  v. Millar, this Court noted that an option merely gives a person the right\r\n  to make a purchase at a fixed price within a fixed time, but it imposes no\r\n  obligation to do so:\r\n\r\n\tAn option is to be distinguished from a sale, or a\r\n  contract, or agreement or offer to sell. The chief difference between a\r\n  contract to sell and purchase real property, and an option to purchase said\r\n  property lies in the fact that, while the former creates a mutual obligation on\r\n  the part of one party to sell and the other to purchase, the option merely\r\n  gives the right to purchase, at a fixed price, within a fixed time, without\r\n  imposing any obligation to do so.\r\n\r\n319 S.C. at 220, 460 S.E.2d\r\n  at 380 (quoting Hutto v. Wiggins, 175 S.C. 202, 205, 178 S.E. 869, 871\r\n  (1935)).Â  An option limits the power of the optionor to revoke the offer, and\r\n  it typically occurs where the optionee pays the optionor to keep an offer to\r\n  sell open.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  Buyer's interpretation that the failure of any condition precedent is a default\r\n  focuses on a few words in the provision while ignoring the overall context of\r\n  the Paragraph 22.17 and its relation to the contract as a whole.Â  There are\r\n  conditions precedent in the other agreements, so the concept is not limited to\r\n  the Sublease.Â  Paragraph 22.17 did not, as the Buyer urges, define the failure\r\n  of a condition precedent as a default.\r\nThe\r\n  option language expressly conflicts with the Buyer's interpretation as the\r\n  option was self-extinguishing in at least two places.Â  First, Paragraph\r\n  22.16(b) of the Sublease provided that if the Buyer did not exercise the\r\n  option at all, it would &quot;automatically expire without further action\r\n  by&quot; the Seller.Â  Second, Paragraph 22.16(e) provided that if the Buyer did exercise the option, but then the closing did not occur within the time limit\r\n  due to the fault of the Buyer, then the option would &quot;be cancelled . . . and\r\n  the earnest money deposit forfeited as agreed upon liquidated damages, and\r\n  there shall be no further rights or liabilities of either party with respect to\r\n  the Option.&quot;Â  Thus, under either scenario, the failure of the condition\r\n  precedent was to result in termination of the purchase of the real property.\r\nWe\r\n  hold no obligation to perform existed and the Buyer's failure to timely\r\n  exercise the option is not a default under any of the agreements that would\r\n  have triggered a cure period.Â  Consequently, we reverse the decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals, which holds the Buyer is entitled to specific performance of\r\n  the option because its failure to satisfy a condition precedent was subject to\r\n  a right to cure.\r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we hold the circuit court correctly determined the Buyer failed to\r\n  timely exercise the option to purchase the real property.Â  The Buyer did not\r\n  issue an unequivocal acceptance that was in exact compliance with the terms of\r\n  the option, particularly, the requirement that the Buyer first close on the\r\n  purchase of the business assets.Â  Thus, the Buyer did not have the right to\r\n  exercise the option based on its failure to comply with the condition\r\n  precedent.Â  Further, the failure to satisfy the condition precedent is not\r\n  subject to a right-to-cure period.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justices John H. Waller, Jr.\r\n  and E. C. Burnett, III, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Joseph N. Caruso was also in the group of Investors\r\n  named in the initial contract, but he is no longer involved in the business and\r\n  is not a party to these proceedings.Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  The circuit court noted that the option language in\r\n  the Restated Commercial Lease differs slightly from that used in the Sublease.Â  \r\n[3] Â Alexander's Land Co., L.L.C. was another entity\r\n  established by the Investors.Â  It was purportedly dismissed as a party by the\r\n  circuit court during the hearing in this matter, but thereafter a judgment for\r\n  attorneys' fees was entered against it.Â  \r\n[4]Â  Both the Seller and MMK have appealed.Â  However, for\r\n  simplicity, the Seller shall be referred to as the appealing party.Â  \r\n[5] Â The circuit court noted that the reason for this\r\n  provision was that if the Buyer purchased the real property and then did not\r\n  close on the purchase of the business assets, then MMK would be left with the\r\n  business assets, but no place to operate the restaurant.\r\n[6]Â  The Seller's attorney testified the Buyer had to\r\n  give written notice, tender the deposit, and close on the business assets, all prior\r\n  to September 1, 2001.Â  \r\n[7]Â  The Seller's allegation regarding the qualified nature\r\n  of the Buyer's acceptance was raised in its Petition for Rehearing to the Court\r\n  of Appeals, and this Court granted certiorari on this question.Â  This Court\r\n  denied certiorari on the Seller's challenge to the ruling of the Court of\r\n  Appeals regarding when payment of the deposit was required, so this issue is\r\n  not before us.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
