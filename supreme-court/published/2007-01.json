Craig Young, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Reprimand\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26241\r\nHeard June 20, 2006 - Filed January 3, 2007Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster and Senior Assistant Attorney General James Bogle, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Reynolds Williams, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Full Panel (Panel) adopted the report of the Hearing Master finding Respondentâ€™s misconduct in litigation was more â€œunprofessionalâ€ than â€œunethical,â€ and recommending that the Court discipline Respondent by issuing an admonition.Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) appeals, contending the Panel erred in failing to find Respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR (RPC), to recommend a more severe sanction, and to require Respondent to pay $1,552.00 as the costs of the proceeding.Â  We agree with ODC that Respondent violated the RPC, that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction, and that Respondent should pay costs.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent undertook the representation of an attorney (Ruffin) in litigation arising out of Ruffinâ€™s participation in a limited liability company (LLC).Â  Ruffin and two doctors formed the LLC to purchase property and build an office building.Â  Ruffin would be responsible for overseeing the construction and associated issues, and would be a tenant in the building, while the doctors would provide the financial backing.\r\nIn 1998, the LLC members began to feel uneasy about the business, and in 1999 the doctors commenced civil litigation on their individual behalves and on behalf of the LLC against Ruffin individually and against Ruffinâ€™s legal practice.Â  The plaintiffs were represented by Jerome P. Askins, III, and the defendants by Respondent.Â  Askins is a personal friend of the doctors, while Respondent was a friend of Ruffin.Â  The Panel found, and the record supports the finding, that personal friendship adversely affected Respondentâ€™s professional judgment in this matter.\r\nIn July 1999, Respondent and Askins appeared before a circuit judge and the outline of a settlement agreement was placed on the record.Â  The agreement had been roughed-out between Respondent and Askins at the courthouse that day.Â  When Ruffin could not obtain financing in time to close the deal as agreed at the July hearing, the parties agreed to an extension.Â  Relationships between the parties and between the attorneys became increasingly acrimonious as it was learned that Ruffin had, in fact, misused LLC funds,[1] and as the settlement was postponed.Â  The closing was reset for October 6, 1999.\r\nOn October 5 and 6, the parties executed a Revised Purchase Agreement.Â  On October 6, Respondent faxed to Askins a document, labeled â€œDraft,â€ entitled â€œSEVERANCE AGREEMENT, RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS, AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTâ€ (Severance Agreement).Â  Two paragraphs of this Severance Agreement are at issue in the present disciplinary action:\r\n\r\n  5.Â  In exchange for receiving the consideration set forth herein, [the Doctors] hereby agree and acknowledge that neither they nor [the] LLC have been a legal client of Thomas E. Ruffin, Jr. and/or Thomas E. Ruffin, Jr., P.C.\r\n  6.Â  [The Doctors] agree to keep this Agreement, the reasons for withdrawing from the LLC, and all matters pertaining to the lawsuit captioned [Doctors] Individually and for the Benefit of [the] LLC, a South Carolina Limited Liability Company v. Thomas E. Ruffin, Jr. and Thomas E. Ruffin, Jr., P.C. completely confidential.Â  In the event that the existence of this Agreement or facts pertaining to the limited liability company and/or the above-referenced lawsuit become known and it can be proved by Mr. Ruffin that such knowledge has come about as a result of [the Doctors] breaching the Confidentiality Agreement, then [one Doctor] and/or [the other Doctor], their heirs and/or assigns shall repay the One Hundred Forty Eight Thousand and 00/100 ($148,000.00) Dollars set forth in this Agreement upon demand, plus interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1 Â½%) per month.\r\n\r\nWe refer to Paragraph 5 as the â€œLegal Representation Clauseâ€ and Paragraph 6 as the â€œConfidentiality Clause.â€\r\nThese two paragraphs caused the entire settlement to fail.Â  The doctors were unwilling to agree to the false[2] Legal Representation Clause, and unwilling to agree to the one-sided Confidentiality Clause.Â  Part of the problem arose because these two paragraphs were â€œin additionâ€ to the terms placed on the record before the circuit judge, and were not presented to the doctors until mere hours before the settlement agreement was to be consummated.[3]\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  After reviewing the Severance Agreement and speaking with the doctors, Askins called Respondent.Â  The Panel found that the â€œtelephone conversation became heated on both sides, and when Askins threatened to â€˜take Ruffin to the Barâ€™ if Ruffin did not â€˜cooperateâ€™ in the settlement, Respondent said: â€˜I am not going to let [Ruffin] buy the building [from the LLC] and have the Doctors run to the Bar and yank his license.â€[4]Â  Askins then faxed a letter to Respondent suggesting alterations to the Severance Agreement, including the deletion of both the Legal Representation Clause and the Confidentiality Clause.Â  Respondent replied by sending an intemperate letter to Askins, stating among other things, that â€œas a result of your bad faith, the transaction and settlement cannot take place.â€Â  Respondent subsequently sent Askins another letter, â€œclarifyingâ€ his earlier letter and â€œconfirmingâ€ that, prior to sending the first letter, Respondent had offered to redraft the Legal Representation Clause to reflect that Ruffinâ€™s firm had, in fact, represented the LLC in some mechanicâ€™s lien matters, and offering to reword the Confidentiality Clause. \r\nThe events of October 6 led to a complete breakdown in relations between the parties and their attorneys.Â  On October 15, 1999, Askins was served with Ruffinâ€™s Answer, Counterclaim, and Third-Party Complaint.Â  The Third-Party Complaint drafted by Respondent alleged Askins and the doctors had violated the civil RICO Act[5] and had committed the tort of outrage against Ruffin.Â  Upon receipt of these pleadings, Askins withdrew from representation of the doctors and the LLC.Â  Respondent withdrew soon after.Â  The underlying suit was eventually settled by Ruffinâ€™s payment of sums to both Askins and the doctors, and the LLC.\r\nPANEL FINDINGS\r\nThe Panel found that Respondent was â€œaggressiveâ€ in propounding the Severance Agreement and in deciding to file the Third Party Complaint (RICO action).Â  The Panel recommended Respondent be admonished â€œagainst emotional reactions and attachments in the practice of law, which can not only cloud judgment, recollection, and analysis, but also lead to intemperate conduct towards fellow members of the bar.â€Â  \r\nA.Â  Severance Agreement\r\nThe Panel concluded that by the time the October 1999 documents were prepared, the settlement agreement put before the circuit court in July 1999 â€œhad simplyâ€¦come off the railsâ€¦.â€Â  The Panel found Respondent believed the relationship between Ruffin and the doctors related solely to a business deal, and did not implicate the practice of law, but â€œwas aggressively one-sided in his attempt to lay that factual issue to rest.â€[6]Â  It found Respondentâ€™s aggressiveness in proposing the Severance Agreement was mitigated by the fact it was merely a draft, which Respondent quickly offered to correct when the â€œLegal Representationâ€ error was pointed out.Â  Finally, the Panel found â€œRespondentâ€™s judgment and memory were likely affected by the friendship with his client, and Respondent was erecting positive barriers to potential disciplinary action.Â  Respondent should be admonished that his conduct here was unprofessional.â€\r\nWe defer to the Panelâ€™s findings and conclusions regarding the Severance Agreement.\r\nWhile the â€œLegal Representation Clauseâ€ was patently false, we defer to the Panelâ€™s finding, premised on its belief in Respondentâ€™s credibility, that the factual error in this clause was the result of an honest oversight by Respondent, which he immediately offered to correct when it was called to his attention.Â  As to the â€œConfidentiality Clause,â€ the Panel found it was merely a draft, created in the course of emotional litigation, which was the result of Respondentâ€™s overly-aggressive representation of Ruffin.Â  We accept the Panelâ€™s findings here, but not without noting that based upon Respondentâ€™s conduct and statements at oral argument before the Court, we have grave reservations whether Respondentâ€™s aggressiveness in the Ruffin litigation was an isolated event, or whether Respondent approaches the practice of law in general from a gladiatorial perspective.Â  Respondent would be well-served to reflect upon his attitude and demeanor.\r\nB.Â  RICO Claim\r\nODC contends Respondent violated the RPC in filing the RICO claim.Â  We agree.\r\nThe RICO complaint alleges that the doctors and Askins engaged in an enterprise using â€œthe U.S. mails and the telephone systems to convey threats and other extortionate communications.â€Â  These defendants were alleged to have violated state and federal laws, specifically two state statutes proscribing unlawful use of a telephone,[7] and blackmail,[8] and federal racketeering statutes.[9]Â  The RICO complaint also alleged that the three defendants unlawfully conspired to violate these state criminal statutes and/or were accessories to their violation.\r\nAt the disciplinary hearing, Respondent testified that to the factual basis for the RICO claim:\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruffin told him one of the doctors had, in a July 1999 telephone conversation, stated that if Ruffin did not settle the case in the manner the doctors felt like it needed to be, then they would go to S.L.E.D. or the sheriff;\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Askins told Respondent in a telephone conversation that he wanted to â€œstomp [Ruffinâ€™s] ass;â€\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Askins told Respondent in a phone call that if the case were not settled on the doctorsâ€™ terms then the doctors would go to S.L.E.D., the solicitorâ€™s office, the attorney generalâ€™s office, the sheriff or disciplinary counsel; and\r\n  4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPA involved in the case told Respondent that in a phone conversation Askins had told the CPA that if Ruffin did not settle on the doctorsâ€™ terms, â€œthen there would be disciplinary action involved.â€Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent testified he viewed the enterpriseâ€™s common purpose to be to extort as much money as possible from Ruffin in settling the civil litigation and winding up the partiesâ€™ business relationship. \r\nRespondent also testified that while he did not dispute the right of any of the RICO defendants to report a crime, the threats in this case violated the blackmail statute because they were made with the intent to extort money from Ruffin.[10]Â  When asked what evidence he had to support the claim that the defendants had violated the unlawful use of a telephone statute, which prohibits among other things profane, vulgar, indecent or immoral words over the phone, Respondent referred to Askinsâ€™ threat to stomp Ruffinâ€™s ass, and to the extortionate threats as â€œimmoral.â€Â  We note that in Respondentâ€™s factual recitation, only one of the doctors is alleged to have made threats although both were sued.\r\nThe RICO complaint drafted by Respondent alleged a violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1957, which concerns engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specific unlawful activities.Â  When asked to explain the factual basis for this allegation, Respondent was unable to provide one, and testified he would have to do some research in order to answer.Â  When he was then asked whether he had done any research prior to filing this RICO claim, Respondent replied he had not, but had instead relied upon knowledge gained in connection with other RICO claims he had handled. \r\nRule 3.1, RPC, provides that â€œA lawyer shall not bringâ€¦a proceedingâ€¦unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolousâ€¦.â€Â  The comments to this rule state, in part, that lawyers are required â€œto inform themselves about the facts of their clientsâ€™ cases and the applicable law and determine that they can make good faith arguments in support of their clientsâ€™ positions.â€Â  It is apparent from Respondentâ€™s testimony that he did no investigation into either the state criminal law upon which his RICO complaint is predicated, nor did he conduct any research into the federal RICO law as it may apply to these facts before proceeding to make these grave allegations against Askins and the doctors.Â  Respondent testified he checked with two (unnamed) members of his firm before filing the RICO complaint, at least one of whom urged him not to file.Â  Respondent presents himself as a RICO expert, and accordingly cannot rely upon his consultations with others to insulate him from a finding that he brought a frivolous RICO claim.Â  Compare In re Ruffin, supra.\r\nThe Panel found, based implicitly on a determination that Respondent was the most credible witness, that Askins and at least one of the doctors had made the statements against Ruffin that Respondent alleged they had made.Â  However, whether these â€œthreatsâ€ were violative of the state criminal blackmail statute or the unlawful use of a telephone statute is highly doubtful.Â  What is clear is that Respondent had no facts implicating one of the doctors he sued, nor did he conduct any legal research before filing this complaint.Â  Further, Respondent was unable to explain the legal basis for at least part of his pleading at this disciplinary hearing, and never contemplated whether South Carolina would recognize a blackmail violation where the defendant threatened to report the plaintiffâ€™s criminal activity to law enforcement and/or disciplinary authorities.\r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated the following ethical rules in filing this retaliatory RICO complaint against the doctors and Attorney Askins: Rule 3.1 (lawyer shall not bring a frivolous proceeding); and Rule 1.1(5) (competent representation includes thoroughness and preparation).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding allegations of misconduct.Â  In re Ruffin, supra.Â  Based upon our review of the entire record in this matter, we find Respondent committed ethical misconduct in the RICO complaint matter.Â  Further, we disagree with the Panelâ€™s recommendation that Respondent receive only an admonition for his misconduct in the Ruffin litigation, and instead impose a Public Reprimand.[11]Â  Finally, we order that Respondent pay, within fifteen (15) days of the date of the filing of this opinion, $1,552.00 for costs.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Ruffin was indefinitely suspended for this misconduct.Â  In re Ruffin, 363 S.C. 347, 610 S.E.2d 803 (2005).\r\n[2] As will be explained infra, Ruffinâ€™s firm had in fact represented the LLC in several mechanicâ€™s liens actions.\r\n[3] The terms agreed to at the hearing pertained primarily to the division of the LLCâ€™s assets, while the Severance Agreement was intended to establish the terms of the dissolution of the business relationship.\r\n[4] In making the finding that these two statements were made, the Hearing Master necessarily resolved credibility questions in favor of Respondent.Â  While we are not bound by the Panelâ€™s findings, we give great weight to those findings which are premised on witness credibility.Â  E.g., In re Flom, 356 S.C. 246, 588 S.E.2d 593 (2003).\r\n[5] RICO is an acronym for the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.Â  See 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1961 et seq.\r\n[6] We accept the Panelâ€™s conclusion that in drafting the Severance Agreement Respondent was influenced by his firmly held belief that the doctors and Ruffin had only a business relationship governed by applicable fiduciary duties and not a legal relationship in a general sense.Â  See also In re Ruffin, supra, holding there was no â€œgeneral legal relationship.â€\r\n[7] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-430.\r\n[8] Â§ 16-11-640.\r\n[9] 18 U.S.C.Â§Â§ 1951; 1952; and 1957.\r\n[10] While â€˜truthâ€™ is generally not a defense to blackmail charges based upon extortionate threats to expose non-criminal behavior, it is unclear whether the â€˜truthâ€™ of a threat to refer someone for criminal charges, i.e. that the person actually committed the offense, is a defense to extortion.Â  See Annot., Truth as a defense to state charges of criminal intimidation, extortion, blackmail, threats and the like, based upon threats to disclose information about the victim, 39 A.L.R. 4th 1011 (1985).Â  We need not decide the novel issue today, but point out that Respondent never even considered whether threats to report a crime could be the basis of a criminal prosecution under the blackmail statute.\r\n[11] In 2005 we accepted an Agreement for Discipline by Consent in an unrelated disciplinary matter involving Respondent and imposed a public reprimand where Respondent admitted sending a settlement proposal which threatened criminal prosecution to gain an advantage in a civil matter, and which mischaracterized part of the proposed settlement as a gift.Â  In re Young, 366 S.C. 180, 621 S.E.2d 359 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26242","title":"Sloan v.

Code Ann. Â§ 57-1-330(A)(2006).Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHardee, Harrell and Truluck are DOT Commissioners.Â  Hardee was appointed to a four-year term, to be served from February 18, 1998 to February 15, 2002.Â Â  In June 2001, his legislative delegation re-elected him to serve a second term, from February 2002 until August 2002.Â Â  Thereafter, in May 2002, his legislative delegation re-elected him to serve as DOT Commissioner from August 15, 2002 to August 15, 2006.Â  In January 2005, Hardee was re-elected to serve from August 2006 until August 2010.\r\nHarrell was elected in May 1999 to serve as DOT Commissioner from February 2000 until February 15, 2004.Â  He has been re-elected to serve from February 15, 2004 through February 15, 2008. \r\nTruluck was elected to serve his first term as DOT Commissioner from February 15, 1998 until February 15, 2002.Â  He served in a hold-over capacity until May 15, 2002, at which time he was re-elected to serve from May 15, 2002 through May 15, 2006.Â  \r\nPetitioners, Sloan and the South Carolina Public Interest Foundation, instituted this complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending the Commissioners were serving in violation of SC Code Ann. Â§Â§ 57-1-320(B) and 57-1-330(A).Â  We accepted the matter in our original jurisdiction.[1]\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTitle 57 of the South Carolina Code establishes the DOT and sets up transportation districts in accord with state congressional districts.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-1-310 (2006) requires the DOT Commission to be composed of one member from each transportation district elected by the delegations of each congressional district, and one at-large member appointed by the Governor.Â  This section further requires that â€œ[s]uch elections or appointment, as the case may be, shall take into account race and gender so as to represent, to the greatest extent possible, all segments of the population of the State.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-1-320 (2006), entitled, â€œCounty divided among two or more districts; consecutive terms limited; limit on commissioners from same county,â€ states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  (B) No county within a Department of Transportation district shall have a resident commission member for more than one consecutive term and in no event shall any two persons from the same county serve as a commission member simultaneously except as provided hereinafter.Â Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).Â  Section 57-1-330 provides: \r\n\r\n  All commission members must serve for a term of office of four years which expires on February fifteenth of the appropriate year.Â  Commissioners shall continue to serve until their successors are elected and qualify, provided that a commissioner may only serve in a hold over capacity for a period not to exceed six months. . . . No person is eligible to serve as a commission member who is not a resident of that district at the time of his appointment, except that the at large commission member may be appointed from any county in the State regardless of whether another commissioner is serving from that county.\r\n\r\nSloan and the SC Public Interest Foundation contend Hardee, Harrell, and Truluck are serving in violation of the above provisions, as they are currently serving in a second or subsequent â€œconsecutive term.â€Â Â  We agree.Â Â Â  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  When a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its literal meaning. Â Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994).Â  Words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Bryant v. City of Charleston, 295 S.C. 408, 368 S.E.2d 899 (1988); State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991).Â  \r\nâ€œConsecutiveâ€ is defined as â€œsuccessive; succeeding one another in regular order; to follow in uninterrupted succession.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, 276 (5th Ed. 1979).Â  The plain and unambiguous meaning of the phrase â€œmore than one consecutive termâ€ is that a DOT commissioner may serve one term and may not serve a succeeding, consecutive term.\r\nRespondents contend the term â€œconsecutive,â€ permits a commissioner to serve one term, consecutive to a first term such that the commissioners may actually serve two successive terms.Â  We disagree.Â  Such a construction would produce an absurd result, clearly not intended by the Legislature.Â  \r\nThere are numerous statutes which permit certain commissioners or board members to serve â€œtwo consecutive terms.â€Â  See e.g. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-13-40 (Human Affairs Commissioner having served two consecutive terms shall be eligible for reappointment one year after the expiration of his second term); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-15-10 (Commission on Women members ineligible to serve more than two consecutive terms); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-61-20 (State Board of Examiners for Registered Environmental Sanitarian members are eligible for reappointment but cannot serve more than two consecutive terms); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-180 (State Health Planning Committee members are appointed for four-year terms, and may serve only two consecutive terms); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 55-11-320 (Richland/Lexington Airport Commission members may not serve more than two consecutive terms).Â  To construe the phrase â€œconsecutiveâ€ as meaning a term, consecutive to a first term, would result in the phrase â€œtwo consecutive termsâ€, in actuality, meaning two terms consecutive to a first, for a total of three terms.[2]Â  To construe the statutes as asserted by Appellants would produce an absurd result.Â  Charleston Trident Home Builders Inc. v. Town Council of Summerville, 369 S.C. 498, 632 S.E.2d 864 (2006); Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994) (when construing a statute, the Court will reject meaning that would lead to an absurd result not intended by the legislature).\r\nLastly, Respondent Hardee contends South Carolina Public Interest Foundation v. Judicial Merit Selection Commâ€™n, 369 S.C. 139, 632 S.E.2d 277 (2006), requires we refrain from ruling on this matter because it presents questions which are exclusively or predominantly political in nature rather than judicial.Â  We disagree.Â Â  In the Public Interest Foundation case, we held that whether the Judicial Merit Selection Commission properly evaluated a candidate seeking election to a circuit court seat was a nonjusticiable political question because the power to determine if a person is qualified to hold judicial office is vested with the General Assembly by the State Constitution.Â  The issue raised there was that the Commission did not adequately investigate whether a candidate met residency requirements for the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit. \r\nPublic Interest Foundation has no application here.Â Â  The sole issue in this case is whether the Commissioners are serving in violation of the statutory terms.Â Â  Defining the meaning of the phrase â€œmore than one consecutive termâ€ is clearly within the prerogative of this Court.Â  Cf. Lindsay v. Natâ€™l Old Line Ins. Co., 262 S.C. 621, 629, 207 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1974) (judicial interpretation of a statute is determinative of its meaning and effect).\r\nAccordingly, we hold section 57-1-320(B) prohibits a DOT Commissioner from serving a consecutive term of office.Â  \r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justices Deadra L. Jefferson and G. Thomas Cooper, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We find this matter of sufficient public interest as to confer standing on Petitioners.Â  Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d 579 (2005); Baird v.

Savitz, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, of Columbia; and Solicitor Christina Theos Adams, of Anderson, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant shot and killed three people in a rural area of Anderson County on November 19, 1997.Â  The victims were brothers Shane and Stacy Walters, aged twenty-seven and twenty-two, and Sonya Cann, aged twenty-one.Â  Appellant was convicted of three counts of murder and three counts of possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and sentenced to death.Â  These convictions were overturned on appeal.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298 (2002).Â  In March 2004, appellant was again convicted and sentenced to death.Â  We affirm appellantâ€™s convictions but reverse and remand for resentencing.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant became acquainted with brothers Shane and Stacy Walters on a Friday night when they met at a mutual friendâ€™s home.Â  Appellant asked the brothers for help with the septic tank at his restaurant.Â  They worked together and socialized over the course of the weekend.Â  All three used methamphetamine repeatedly from Friday until late into the night on Sunday.Â  At about 5:00 a.m. Monday morning, the three men went to pick up Shaneâ€™s girlfriend, Sonya, at her home.Â  The four of them drove off in Shaneâ€™s extended-cab â€œduallyâ€ truck.Â  The victims were not seen alive again.\r\nLater that morning, at about 8:15 a.m., appellant came to the Seneca police department and told police he had killed three people in self-defense.Â  He led police to a secluded kudzu field where police found the bodies of Shane, Stacy, and Sonya on the ground.Â  The truck was recovered from where appellant had parked it at his fatherâ€™s house.Â  Its interior was covered with blood.Â  Forensic evidence indicated that all three victims had been shot in the head at close range while seated in the cab of the truck and their bodies had been dragged onto the ground.Â  The State also produced evidence that Stacy and Shane had been stomped while on the ground and Sonya was shot in the head while lying there. \r\nThe only weapon used was appellantâ€™s semi-automatic pistol which could hold eight rounds, seven in the magazine and one in the chamber.[1]Â  Two empty magazines were at the scene indicating appellant had reloaded.Â  Experts estimated up to eleven shots could have been fired.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the exclusion of evidence in the guilt phase prejudicial?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the admission of evidence regarding prison conditions in the sentencing phase reversible error?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Exclusion of evidence in guilt phase\r\nAppellant claimed self-defense.Â  He testified that he killed the victims because he believed the brothers had been hired to kill him by his uncle, Ronnie Burkhart, an infamous drug-dealer with whom appellant was on bad terms.Â  \r\nAppellant testified that when they arrived at the kudzu field, Shane was holding appellantâ€™s gun because appellant had given it to him to shoot at a deer earlier.Â  While they were sitting in the truck, Shane asked appellant if he had ever wronged â€œUncle Ronnie.â€Â  Because appellant had been threatened by Ronnie and was surprised that Shane knew Ronnie, he immediately became anxious.Â  Shane then pointed the gun at appellant and ordered him out of the truck.Â  Stacy said, â€œWeâ€™re going to make you squeal like a pig, boy,â€ which appellant took to mean they were going to rape him.Â  \r\nAppellant grabbed the gun from Shane and began shooting.Â  When it was over, he pushed the bodies out of the truck and put the second magazine in the gun because he thought someone else may have been out in the field.Â  A shot went off outside the truck.Â  Finally, appellant drove off in Shaneâ€™s truck.Â  He went to pick up his wife and his father because he was afraid Ronnie would hurt them.Â  After parking Shaneâ€™s truck at his fatherâ€™s house, appellant went to the police.\r\nSheriff Taylor was called as a defense witness.Â  He testified that Ronnie, who was now deceased, was at one time an international drug smuggler in cocaine and marijuana with connections to violent drug lords.Â  On cross-examination, Sheriff Taylor stated that Ronnie was very careful in his dealings.Â  The solicitor then asked, â€œDid you ever uncover anything that showed that Shane and Stacy were on (sic) any of this inside circle that Ronnie Burkhart would have trusted them?â€Â  Sheriff Taylor answered â€œno.â€Â  In reply, the defense sought to elicit Sheriff Taylorâ€™s testimony that Shane had been arrested for buying a sixteenth of an ounce of methamphetamine from an undercover agent in December 1995, two years before the killings.Â  The solicitor objected on the ground of relevance and the trial judge excluded the evidence.Â  Appellant claims the exclusion of this evidence prejudiced him because it indicated a relationship between the brothers and Ronnie that would substantiate his claim of self-defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nSheriff Taylor testified Ronnie Burkhart was out of the drug business by 1991, Ronnie did not deal in methamphetamine, and he knew of no connection between Shaneâ€™s 1995 drug transaction and Ronnie.Â  In the absence of any evidence linking Shaneâ€™s drug transaction to Ronnie, the excluded evidence did not tend to make more or less probable appellantâ€™s claim that Shane would have worked for Ronnie as a hit man.Â  See Rule 401, SCRE (evidence is relevant if it tends to make the existence of any fact at issue more or less probable).Â  We find the exclusion of this evidence could not reasonably have affected the outcome of the trial.Â  See State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 609 S.E.2d 520 (2005) (exclusion of evidence is not reversible error if it could not reasonably have affected outcome of trial).Â  \r\n2.Â  Admission of evidence in sentencing phase\r\nDuring the sentencing phase of trial, appellant objected to testimony by Stateâ€™s witness James Sligh, Director of Inmate Classification for the Department of Corrections, regarding the privileges available to an inmate who receives a sentence of life without parole.Â  These privileges include access to the yard, work, education, meals, canteen, phone, library, recreation, mail, television, and outside visitors.Â  On cross-examination, Sligh acknowledged that prison life is â€œvery regimentedâ€ and â€œis not a country club.â€Â  Further, appellant presented evidence through his own witness that prison is a harsh environment with violent predators where oneâ€™s freedom is severely curtailed.Â  \r\nWe have long held that evidence in the sentencing phase of a capital trial must be relevant to the character of the defendant or the circumstances of the crime.Â  State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982).Â  The juryâ€™s sole function is to make a sentencing determination based on these factors and not to legislate a plan of punishment.Â  State v. Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 360 S.E.2d 317 (1987).Â  â€œSuch determinations as the time, place, manner, and conditions of execution or incarceration . . . are reserved . . . to agencies other than the jury.â€Â  State v. Plath (Plath II), 281 S.C. 1, 15, 313 S.E.2d 619, 627 (1984) (emphasis added).Â  Based on this reasoning, we have disallowed defense evidence regarding the process of electrocution, State v. Plath (Plath I), 277 S.C. 126, 284 S.E.2d 221 (1981), and expert testimony regarding the deterrent effect of capital punishment.Â  State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996).\r\nRecently, in State v. Bowman, 366 S.C. 485, 623 S.E.2d 378 (2005), the defendant challenged on appeal the admission of evidence regarding general prison conditions.Â  Although we found the issue was not preserved for review, we cautioned the State and the defense bar that such evidence is not relevant to the question of whether a defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.Â  366 S.C. at 498-99, 623 S.E.2d at 387.Â  \r\nThis case was tried before our decision in Bowman; however, we apply that reasoning here because it is consistent with our long-standing rule that evidence in the sentencing phase of a capital trial must be relevant to the character of the defendant or the circumstances of the crime.Â  We are aware of the tension between evidence regarding the defendantâ€™s adaptability to prison life, which is clearly admissible,[2] and this restriction on the admission of evidence regarding prison life in general.Â  We note, however, that evidence of the defendantâ€™s characteristics may include prison conditions if narrowly tailored to demonstrate the defendantâ€™s personal behavior in those conditions.Â  \r\nHere, unlike Bowman, appellant objected to the Stateâ€™s evidence regarding general prison conditions.Â  Although appellant attempted to counter the testimony of the Stateâ€™s witness with evidence regarding the harshness of prison life, this entire subject matter injected an arbitrary factor into the juryâ€™s sentencing considerations. Â A capital jury may not impose a death sentence under the influence of any arbitrary factor.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) (2003).Â  When the jury is invited to speculate about irrelevant matters upon which a death sentence may be based, Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) is violated.Â  State v. Sloan, 278 S.C. 435, 298 S.E.2d 92 (1982).Â  Accordingly, we reverse appellantâ€™s death sentence and remand for resentencing.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; REMANDED.\r\nWALLER, J, concurs. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s conclusion that appellant is entitled to a new sentencing proceeding.Â  I write separately because I believe a violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) (2003) is not subject to a harmless error analysis.\r\nI agree with the majority that the prison conditions testimony by Mr. Sligh violated our rule that evidence in the sentencing phase of a capital trial must be relevant to the character of the defendant or the circumstances of the crime.Â  More importantly, this inadmissible evidence infused an arbitrary factor into the juryâ€™s decision to return a death sentence.Â  Once an arbitrary matter has been presented to the jury, this Court cannot uphold the death sentence if we are to fulfill our statutory duty under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1).Â  State v. Shaw, 273 S.C. 194, 209-210, 255 S.E.2d 799, 807 (1979), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nThe dissent argues that the statuteâ€™s prohibition against imposing a death sentence obtained under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor merely recites the requirements of the Eighth Amendment.Â  As a result, although not finding the evidence in this case to introduce an arbitrary subject to the jury, the dissent would subject violations of Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) to a harmless error analysis.[3]\r\nIn my opinion, this Court should not apply a standard of review for constitutional errors to statutory violations.Â  The dissent ignores the plain language of the statute, which requires this Court to â€œdetermine whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) (emphasis added).Â  We are not required to determine if appellantâ€™s cross-examination of Mr. Sligh was able to remedy any error.Â  Once improper evidence of any kind injects an arbitrary factor into the juryâ€™s consideration, this Court cannot uphold the death sentence under Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1).Â  Moreover, a review for harmless error is unnecessary because by definition, evidence that implicates an arbitrary factor is prejudicial.\r\nWe must honor the General Assembly's prerogative to establish the procedure which it deems necessary to the fair administration of the death penalty. Â Where the legislature requires this Court to review a death sentence for possible arbitrariness, that directive should be conscientiously honored. Â I would thus not engage in a harmless error analysis which could potentially uphold a death sentence returned under the influence of an arbitrary factor. Accordingly, I agree with the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse the death sentence and remand for resentencing.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal: I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the introduction of irrelevant evidence in a capital sentencing proceeding does not, in and of itself, warrant reversal of Appellantâ€™s death sentence.Â  \r\nAlthough we cautioned in State v. Bowman that evidence relating to the conditions of incarceration should not be admitted during a capital sentencing proceeding, nothing in that case indicated a departure from the general rules governing appeals involving the admission of evidence or constitutional issues.Â  See 366 S.C. 485, 498-99, 623 S.E.2d 378, 385 (2005).Â  With this principle in mind, I believe our jurisprudence requires clarification.\r\nThat evidentiary appeals in criminal trials and questions of fundamental fairness sometimes overlap must be an easy conclusion.Â  Even the most cursory review of this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence and federal precedent in the capital arena reveals as much.Â  Arguments in capital cases involving the introduction of evidence will invariably be buttressed by considerations of fundamental fairness secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.Â  In these cases, both the evidentiary questions of state law and the federal constitutional questions are of paramount importance.Â  Accordingly, a genuine resolution requires that these issues be given a complete discussion.\r\nA trial court has a great deal of latitude concerning rulings on the admissibility of evidence, and a trial courtâ€™s ruling on such an issue will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion and a demonstration of prejudice. State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 9-10, 313 S.E.2d 619, 624 (1984); State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 103, 16 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1941).Â  \r\nIn this case, although the trial court admitted irrelevant evidence during Appellantâ€™s sentencing proceeding, I can find no evidence indicating that the introduction of this evidence prejudiced Appellant.Â  Although the State improperly introduced evidence regarding the general conditions that Appellant would experience while in prison, Appellant cross-examined the Stateâ€™s witness at length and demonstrated that the conditions of Appellantâ€™s imprisonment would be quite severe.Â  Specifically, Appellant was able to inform the jury that, if he was spared the death penalty, he would be subject to the second highest degree of restriction in South Carolinaâ€™s prison system for the remainder of his life.[4]Â  In short, though this evidence was irrelevant and improper, Appellant used the evidence quite effectively to argue against imposing the death penalty.Â  Absent a showing of prejudice which resulted from the introduction of this evidence, our standards of review require us to affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.[5] \r\nTurning to the questions of federal law, the Eighth Amendment is violated when the decision to impose the death penalty is made in an arbitrary manner, or â€œout of a whim, passion, prejudice, or mistake.â€Â  Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 329-30 (1985); State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 587, 300 S.E.2d 63, 72 (1982).Â  Violations of the Fourteenth Amendment occur when something â€œso infects the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.â€Â  See Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986).Â  Furthermore, an appellate courtâ€™s inquiry does not end upon finding that a constitutional violation occurred.Â  Very recently, the United States Supreme Court reminded us that harmless error analysis is a constitutionally sufficient rubric by which an appellate court may judge whether most constitutional violations require reversal in a criminal case.Â  Washington v. Recuenco, 548 U.S. Â­Â­Â­__, 126 S.Ct. 2546, 2551 (2006).\r\nIn this case, I would not reach the question of whether the trial courtâ€™s error in admitting the above described evidence was harmless because I would find no constitutional violations occurred.Â  As a first matter, Appellant did not raise any constitutional objections in the trial court, and it is not clear that he raises these issues here.[6]Â  Assuming, however, that Appellant makes such arguments, in my view, the introduction of this improper evidence did not create an impermissible risk that the jury would make the decision to impose the death penalty in an arbitrary manner, nor did it so infect Appellantâ€™s sentencing proceeding with prejudice as to render it fundamentally unfair.[7]Â  Again, because I would find that no constitutional violations resulted from the introduction of this evidence, I do not believe this Court need decide whether any evidentiary error was harmless.\r\nIn my view, the majorityâ€™s resolution of this issue is controlled by a theme found largely in dicta beginning in State v. Woomer.Â  In that case, this Court stated â€œ[w]hen a solicitorâ€™s personal opinion is explicitly injected into the juryâ€™s deliberations as though it were in itself evidence justifying a sentence of death, the resulting death sentence may not be free from the influence of any arbitrary factor as required by S.C. Code Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1), and by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.â€Â  277 S.C. at 175, 284 S.E.2d at 359.Â  \r\nI believe this Court has mistakenly seized upon the latter part of that statement and proceeded to treat Â§ 16-3-25(C) as providing a separate standard by which this Court should judge the conduct of capital sentencing proceedings.[8]Â  In my view, State v. Torrence all but openly rejects the argument that the statuteâ€™s prohibition of imposing a death sentence obtained under the influence of â€œpassion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor,â€ constitutes anything other than a recital of the Eighth Amendmentâ€™s requirements. Â See 305 S.C. at 68, 406 S.E.2d at 328.Â  Furthermore, in my view, the Eighth Amendmentâ€™s requirements are primarily concerned with the ultimate result in capital cases, which is â€œpreventing the imposition of excessive and disproportionate punishment upon the individual prisoner.â€Â  State v. Copeland, 378 S.C. 572, 590, 300 S.E.2d 63, 73-74 (1982).Â  Thus, even if Torrence did not reject this proposition, I would decline to view Â§ 16-3-25(C) as proscribing a standard of review that is independent from the Eighth Amendment.Â  Instead, I would interpret the statute to prohibit the imposition of the death penalty only in those situations where it would offend the Constitution.Â  In my view, a separate standard is not necessary.[9]\r\nOur pronouncement disfavoring this evidence in Bowman was nothing new.Â  See Plath, 281 S.C. at 15, 313 S.E.2d at 627 (â€œIt should not be necessary in the near future . . . to remind the bench and bar of the strict focus to be maintained in the course of a capital sentencing trial.â€); and Smart, 278 S.C. at 526, 299 S.E.2d at 692-93 (â€œWhile this Court approves zealous representation . . . it is important in capital cases to maintain strict focus upon the particular characteristics of the specific crime and the unique attributes of the defendant.â€).Â  In reversing this case, I believe we treat the disapproval of this type of evidence as though it were a novel development, and that we unnecessarily depart from an established course of analysis that is easily tied to defined doctrines.Â  In my view, reversing Appellantâ€™s sentence uses Bowman to propagate a rule that inappropriately presumes prejudice in many cases and is unjustified given the existing constitutional framework.[10]\r\nThe majority and concurrence presume what they purport to establish, which is that Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) requires reversal when improper evidence is introduced in a capital sentencing proceeding.Â  Were that the General Assemblyâ€™s intention, I believe it surely would have spoken in terms of an arbitrary factorâ€™s â€œpresenceâ€ instead of its â€œinfluence.â€Â  Appellate courts are ill-equipped to speculate about the influence improperly admitted evidence might have exerted on a juryâ€™s determination.Â  Therefore, in my view, the most prudent course in these cases is to tie the statutory review requirement to the established guideposts provided by the relevant constitutional jurisprudence.Â  Today, the majority and concurrence endorse a rule that is markedly stricter than the constitution requires, is contrary to at least two of this Courtâ€™s prior decisions, and plays far too loosely with the language of the statute. \r\nFor these reasons, I would hold that the trial court erred in admitting evidence relating to the conditions of incarceration during Appellantâ€™s capital sentencing proceeding, but I would affirm Appellantâ€™s death sentence.\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Shaneâ€™s unloaded hunting rifle was found under the truckâ€™s back seat beneath a large speaker.Â  In Sonyaâ€™s purse were two unopened pocketknives, and Shane had an unopened knife in his pants pocket.Â Â  \r\n[2]See generally Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1 (1986) (evidence of good behavior in prison admissible in mitigation as relevant to future adaptability); State v. Schafer, 352 S.C. 191, 573 S.E.2d 796 (2002) (evidence of violent behavior in prison relevant to future dangerousness); State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996) (defendantâ€™s future dangerousness and his adaptability to prison life are legitimate interests in the penalty phase of a capital case). \r\n[3] This Court has acknowledged the appropriateness of harmless error analysis in capital cases where a defendantâ€™s constitutional rights are violated.Â  See Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 430 S.E.2d 834 (1992).\r\n[4] Eight pages of the record contain the Stateâ€™s expertâ€™s direct testimony. Appellantâ€™s cross-examination of this expert fills twenty pages of the record.\r\n[5] Plath further underscores my point. Â In that case, this Court unanimously affirmed a death sentence because these precise errors were not accompanied by any demonstration of prejudice.Â  See 281 S.C. at 9-10, 313 S.E.2d at 624.\r\n[6] At trial, Appellant objected that this testimony was improper under this Courtâ€™s ruling in Plath.Â  That case contains no material discussion of the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments.Â  Plathâ€™s discussion of this type of evidence is best interpreted as resolving a traditional appeal of a question of the admission of evidence.Â  See 281 S.C at 14-16, 313 S.E.2d at 627.Â  \r\n[7] In making this determination, I judge the effect of these evidentiary errors in the context of the entire record.Â  See State v. Woomer, 277 S.C. 170, 174-75, 284 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1981). \r\n[8] This principle has consistently re-appeared in our precedent.Â  See Thompson v. Aiken, 281 S.C. 239, 240, 315 S.E.2d 110, 110 (1984); State v. Sloan, 278 S.C. 435, 438, 298 S.E.2d 92, 93 (1982); State v. Smart, 278 S.C. 515, 517, 299 S.E.2d 686, 687 (1982) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 70, 406 S.E.2d 315, 329 (1991)); and State v. Butler, 277 S.C. 543, 544, 290 S.E.2d 420, 420 (1982) (overruled on other grounds by Torrence, 305 S.C. at 70, 406 S.E.2d at 329).\r\n[9] I do not necessarily question the holdings in the cases I have cited, only the reasoning.Â  Any number of errors can infect a trial with unfairness to such a degree as to violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.Â  These include (1) the introduction of overly inflammatory evidence and (2) arguments which impermissibly appeal to the passions or prejudices of a jury.\r\n[10] Coincidentally, the view taken by the concurrence is contrary to our opinion in Bowman and seems to embrace a rekindled form of Â­in favorem vitae review. Â This view, if applied in Bowman, would surely have commanded the Court to at least deal with the merits of Bowmanâ€™s claim regarding this â€œprison conditionsâ€ testimony rather than disposing of his claim on error preservation grounds.Â  See 366 S.C. at 498, 623 S.E.2d at 385.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26244","title":"In the Matter of Carlton D.

Buffkin, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of an admonition or a public reprimand.Â  We accept the Agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nIn 2005, respondent was contacted by National Real Estate Information Services (NREIS) about handling closings of residential real estate transactions in South Carolina.Â  Respondent closed approximately thirty transactions arranged by NREIS in 2005, all of which involved refinances except for the subject transaction, which was a purchase transaction.Â  \r\nWith regard to the subject transaction, respondent, after speaking with the complainant, declined to proceed with the closing.Â  As for the refinances, respondent represents that each was handled by him in substantially the same manner.Â  Respondent would typically receive the closing package a day in advance of the closing.Â  He did not prepare the title abstracts used in the closings.Â  Instead, he was informed by NREIS that they use other South Carolina attorneys to do the title work and obtain a certified legal opinion prior to closing.Â  Once a certified legal opinion was obtained, NREIS would forward the relevant closing materials to respondent for closing.Â  However, respondent took no affirmative action to verify NREISâ€™ representations nor did he ever obtain a copy of the certified legal opinions for the refinances.Â  Respondent represents that at each closing he reviewed all of the relevant documents, including the terms of the loan, with the client and that this process included a careful review of the Settlement Statement to confirm the clientâ€™s agreement with the costs and disbursements associated with the closing transaction.Â  At the conclusion of the closings, respondent forwarded the closing documents to NREIS.Â  He did not record the mortgage associated with any of the transactions nor did he take any affirmative action to confirm that the mortgages were properly recorded.Â  In addition, respondent had no involvement in the disbursement of funds to each client and did not take any action to confirm that the funds were disbursed as reflected in the Settlement Statement.\r\nRespondent, who has no prior disciplinary history, has been forthright and cooperative with ODC throughout this investigation and maintains he is committed to the improvement of the management of his practice to insure full compliance with the guidelines governing real estate closings.Â \r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that his conduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers).Â  In addition, respondent admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 5.5(b) (lawyer shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand. Accordingly, we accept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nÂ PUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26245","title":"In the Matter of Sally G.

Calhoun, of Beaufort, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of an admonition or a public reprimand.Â  We accept the Agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\n In May 2005, Nationwide Appraisal contacted respondent to retain her services as closing attorney to handle the closing of a home equity line of credit for a client.Â  The closing occurred on May 9, 2005, at respondentâ€™s office.Â  Respondent received the closing documents and instructions from Nationwide Appraisal either the day before or the day of the closing.Â  Respondent did not prepare the closing documents or perform the title exam nor does she know the identity of the person who did so.Â  Respondent assumed that person was an attorney licensed in South Carolina or was supervised by such an attorney; however, she admits she took no affirmative action to verify this information.\r\nPrior to the closing, respondent reviewed the closing documents for accuracy.Â  In addition, she advised the client at the closing that the scope of her representation was limited to reviewing the closing documents, explaining them to the client and ensuring that the documents were properly executed.Â  Further, respondent reviewed the documents with the client and ensured that the necessary documents were properly executed per Nationwide Appraisalâ€™s instructions.Â  Respondent forwarded the closing documents to the lender, but did not record the mortgage for the client nor take any steps to ensure that someone else properly recorded the mortgage.Â  Respondent again assumed that a licensed South Carolina attorney, other than herself, was responsible for recording the mortgage; however, she took no affirmative action to verify that such action was taken.\r\nNationwide Appraisal paid respondent $200 for her services a few weeks after the closing; however, the HUD-1A Settlement Statement executed at the clientâ€™s closing does not reflect a payment to respondent.Â  The Settlement Statement does include a charge of $175 to Nationwide Appraisal for a settlement or closing fee, as well as a charge of $55 to GAC for an abstract or title search.[1]\r\nRespondent has informed ODC that prior to the closing at issue, she handled several other closings for Nationwide Appraisal and those closings were handled in substantially the same manner as described above.Â  ODC has no information that anyone involved in these closings suffered any harm as a result of respondentâ€™s conduct.Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes that participating in â€œwitness onlyâ€ closings when no other South Carolina licensed attorney is involved has the effect of assisting in the unauthorized practice of law and constitutes a failure to carry out the responsibilities of a closing attorney as provided by previous directives of this Court.Â  Respondent further recognizes that she did not provide her client with competent representation.Â  She agrees her actions constitute misconduct under the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  However, she maintains that, in the future, she will make every effort not to handle matters without first making herself familiar with the applicable guidelines and law.Â  Finally, respondent, who has no prior disciplinary history, has been forthright and cooperative with ODC throughout this investigation.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that her conduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers).Â  In addition, respondent admits she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 5.5(b) (lawyer shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.

Â We certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and affirm as modified the circuit courtâ€™s decision to uphold the issuance of the stormwater permit.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 2003, Wal-Mart applied for a stormwater permit in connection with a proposed development in Florence, South Carolina.Â  Wal-Martâ€™s proposed development includes the construction of a Wal-Mart Supercenter, an accompanying parking lot, and a central stormwater detention pond.Â  The stormwater would flow across the paved and landscaped areas to inlets, which would lead to the detention pond.Â  The detention pond would accommodate 2, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year frequency storm events.Â  From the detention pond, the stormwater would flow into an unnamed tributary and continue in the unnamed tributary for approximately one-half mile at which point the unnamed tributary converges with Jeffries Creek. \r\nRespondent South Carolina Department of Health and Environment Control (DHEC) granted the stormwater permit.Â  Responsible Economic Development, Angela Ketchum, Carolyn Jebaily, Peggy Brown, Rachell Hyman, Bobby Griffin, and Walter Sallenger, its Members and Directors, (Appellants) objected to the issuance of the stormwater permit and brought this contested case before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).Â  At the hearing, Appellants argued 26 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 72-305(B)(4) (Supp. 2005) required denial of the stormwater permit because Wal-Martâ€™s proposed development violated the antidegradation rules set forth in 25 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-68 and -69 (Supp. 2005).Â  The ALJ issued a Final Order and Decision upholding DHECâ€™s grant of a stormwater permit.\r\nAppellants appealed to the Board of Health and Environment Control (Board), which affirmed the ALJâ€™s decision.Â  On further appeal, the circuit court upheld the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court err in affirming the Boardâ€™s decision to uphold the grant of a stormwater permit to Wal-Mart? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis case involves appearances before four tribunals.Â  The ALJ presided as the finder of fact at the contested hearing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (2005).Â  The Board sat in an appellate capacity, and its review was governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(D).Â  The circuit court also sat in an appellate capacity, and its review was governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6).\r\n This Court determines whether the circuit court properly applied its standard of review and applies the same standard of review established for the circuit court.Â  Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 512, 560 S.E.2d 410, 413 (2002).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify the decision of any agency if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the findings, conclusions, or decisions of the agency are:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (d) affected by other error of law;\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial  evidence on the whole record; or\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or  clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Act. No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erroneously affirmed the issuance of a stormwater permit in this case.Â  Appellants allege Regulation 72-305(B)(4) requires the denial of the stormwater permit because stormwater runoff from Wal-Martâ€™s proposed development will further depress oxygen levels in the unnamed tributary and Jeffries Creek and thus violates the antidegradation rules set forth in Regulations 61-68(D)(1) and -69.Â  Appellants also contend Regulation 72-305(B)(4) requires the denial of the stormwater permit because Wal-Mart has failed to employ adequate measures to handle pollutants discharged from the development as required by Regulation 61-68(D)(2) and DHECâ€™s written policy regarding antidegradation.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, Bureau of Water, Antidegradation for Activities Contributing Nonpoint Source Pollution to Impaired Waters (Nov. 1999).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act (Stormwater Act)[1] requires a person who intends to engage in a land disturbing activity[2] to submit a stormwater management and sediment control plan to the appropriate agency and obtain a permit before engaging in the activity, unless an exemption applies.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-14-30 (Supp. 2005).Â  The Stormwater Act further requires DHEC to promulgate regulations for the â€œtypes of activities that require a stormwater . . . permitâ€ and for â€œpermit application and approval requirements.â€Â  Id. Â§ 48-14-50(C)(3) &amp; (9).Â  DHEC fulfilled that duty by promulgating, in relevant part, Regulations 72-305 and -307.Â  Regulation 72-305 outlines the permit application and approval procedure, and Regulation 72-307 sets forth the minimum standards and specifications and the specific design criteria for projects requiring a stormwater management and sediment control plan.Â  \r\nRegulation 72-305(B)(3) requires Regulations 72-305 and -307 to apply to land disturbing activities disturbing more than five acres.Â  DHEC can modify the regulatory requirements of Regulations 72-305 and -307 â€œon a case-by-case basis to address specific stormwater quantity or quality problems or to meet S.C. Coastal Council or other regulatory requirements.â€[3] 26 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 72-305(B)(4).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe ALJ determined the requirements of Regulations 72-305 and -307 applied to this case because Wal-Martâ€™s proposed development involves a land disturbing activity covering approximately 43 acres.Â  He found the stormwater runoff from Wal-Martâ€™s development would not flow directly into Jeffries Creek, an impaired water body, but would flow directly into an unnamed tributary, which is an unimpaired water body.Â  Then the stormwater would flow for one-half mile before converging with Jeffries Creek, and he determined the stormwater runoff would obtain re-aeration properties before converging with Jeffries Creek.Â  The ALJ found stormwater runoff from three other commercial developments flowed into the unnamed tributary before converging with Jeffries Creek without negatively affecting the water quality of Jeffries Creek.Â  He also found there was no significant evidence that quantified the inadequate measures alleged by Appellants.Â  Based on the totality of the circumstances, the ALJ determined Regulation 72-305(B)(4) was not applicable to Wal-Martâ€™s application for a stormwater permit and upheld the issuance of the stormwater permit to Wal-Mart.Â  \r\nThe Board affirmed the ALJâ€™s decision.Â  The circuit court found the Boardâ€™s view of the antidegradation rules conformed to the framework set forth in Regulations 61-68 and -69 and found there was substantial evidence to support the ALJâ€™s and the Boardâ€™s findings.Â  \r\nAppellants allege Wal-Martâ€™s proposed development violates regulations promulgated pursuant to the Pollution Control Act.[4]Â  The purpose of the Pollution Control Act is â€œto maintain reasonable standards of purity of the air and water resources of the State. . . .â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-1-20 (1987). Â DHEC has the â€œauthority to abate, control and prevent pollutionâ€ in order to enforce the provisions of the Pollution Control Act.Â  Id.Â  DHEC is also authorized to issue permits pursuant to the Pollution Control Act for discharge of wastes or air contaminants and for construction or alteration of disposal systems.Â  Id. Â§Â§ 48-1-100 &amp; -110 (Supp. 2005).Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough stormwater runoff is a source of pollution,[5] the legislature enacted the Stormwater Act to specifically deal with stormwater management and sediment reduction.Â  The purpose of the Stormwater Act is â€œto reduce the adverse effects of stormwater runoff and sediment and to safeguard property and the public welfare by strengthening and making uniform the existing stormwater management and sediment control program.â€Â  Act No. 51, 1991 Acts 167.Â  The Stormwater Act requires DHEC to issue permits for persons engaging in a land disturbing activity, unless an exemption applies.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-14-30(A).Â Â Â  \r\nAs a creature of statutes, regulatory bodies like DHEC have only the authority granted them by the legislature.&nbsp; Med. Socâ€™y of S.C. v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 334 S.C. 270, 275, 513 S.E.2d 352, 355 (1999); City of Columbia v. Bd. of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 292 S.C. 199, 202, 355 S.E.2d 536, 538 (1987).Â  Any action taken by DHEC outside of its statutory and regulatory authority is null and void.Â  Triska v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 292 S.C. 190, 194, 355 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1987).Â  \r\nRelevant to this appeal, the regulations of the Pollution Control Actâ€”Regulations 61-68 and -69[6]â€”and the regulations of the Stormwater Actâ€”Regulations 72-305 and -307[7]â€”do not reference each other and are authorized by different enabling acts.Â  In the absence of statutory authorization to apply the two acts and their corresponding regulations to each other, the regulations of the Pollution Control Act do not apply to the Stormwater Act or its regulations.Â  Accordingly, we conclude, as a matter of law, the case-by-case modification of regulatory requirements under the Stormwater Act cannot be invoked because of an alleged violation of the Pollution Control Actâ€™s regulations.Â  Furthermore, a stormwater permit issued pursuant to the Stormwater Act cannot be denied based on the regulations of the Pollution Control Act.Â  Therefore, Regulation 72-305(B)(4) does not require the denial of a stormwater permit on the ground that the antidegradation rules have been violated because the regulations of the Pollution Control Act do not apply to the Stormwater Act.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we affirm as modified the decision to grant a stormwater permit to Wal-Mart.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â S.C.

Pachak, of South Carolina Offense of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the grant of post-conviction relief (PCR) to Creuncle D. Suber (Respondent).&nbsp; We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 9, 2002, Respondent drove away from a convenience store in Newberry, South Carolina without paying for gasoline.Â  The store clerk reported the incident, including a description of the car and of Respondent, to the county sheriffâ€™s department.Â  Lieutenant Wesley Boland responded to the call.Â  When he saw Respondent driving a car matching the store clerkâ€™s description, he activated his blue lights and siren, but Respondent did not stop.Â  Respondent continued driving until he entered a dead-end dirt road.Â  At the dead end, Respondent turned around in a driveway, and Lieutenant Boland attempted to block Respondent from exiting the driveway.Â  According to Lieutenant Boland, Respondent collided with the officerâ€™s vehicle, and this collision provided Respondent enough space to maneuver out of the driveway and continue his escape.Â  Respondent subsequently wrecked his car and continued his flight on foot.Â  Lieutenant Boland pursued Respondent, a struggle ensued, and Respondent was eventually apprehended.Â  \r\nRespondent pled guilty to failure to stop for a blue light and no contest to assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK) and to resisting arrest with a deadly weapon.Â  He was sentenced to fourteen yearsâ€™ imprisonment for ABWIK, ten years for resisting arrest with a deadly weapon, and three years for failing to stop, to be served concurrently.Â  \r\nRespondent filed this application for PCR, alleging plea counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him that assault with intent to kill (AWIK) was a lesser-included offense of ABWIK.Â  At the PCR hearing, Respondent testified Lieutenant Boland hit his car in an attempt to stop Respondent from fleeing, and he testified he never attempted to hit the officer with his car.Â  Respondent also submitted into evidence pictures of his car after the incident, which Respondent alleged showed the officer hit his car.Â  He further testified plea counsel advised him there were no lesser-included offenses to any of his charges, but if he had known a jury could consider AWIK, he would have insisted on proceeding to trial rather than pleading guilty. \r\nAlso at the PCR hearing, plea counsel testified although there were extensive plea negotiations, the negotiations failed and he proceeded to prepare for trial.Â  Plea counsel testified he was prepared for trial, but on the day of trial, Respondent chose to plead guilty and no contest to the charges.Â  He also testified he was likely surprised by Respondentâ€™s decision to plead guilty on the day of trial because he had told the plea judge he had stayed up late preparing for trial.Â  Plea counsel conceded he did not discuss AWIK as a lesser-included offense of ABWIK with Respondent.Â  Plea counsel denied he told Respondent there were no lesser-included offenses for any of the charges because plea counsel alleged they never discussed lesser-included offenses.Â  He also testified if Respondent had gone to trial and the evidence presented at trial required the jury to be instructed on a lesser-included offense, he would have requested such a charge. \r\nThe PCR judge found plea counsel was deficient for failing to advise Respondent of lesser-included offenses including AWIK.Â  The PCR judge also found Respondent was prejudiced by this deficiency and granted Respondent a new trial.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the PCR judge err in granting Respondent a new trial based on  ineffective assistance of counsel?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).Â  There is a two-prong test for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  First, a PCR applicant must show that his counselâ€™s performance was deficient such that it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693 (1984); Alexander v. State, 303 S.C. 539, 541, 402 S.E.2d 484, 485 (1991).Â  Second, an applicant must show there is a reasonable probability, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; Alexander, 303 S.C. at 541-42, 402 S.E.2d at 485.Â  Where there has been a guilty plea, the applicant must prove prejudice by showing that, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability he would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203, 210 (1985); Jordan v. State, 297 S.C. 52, 54, 374 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1988).Â  In determining guilty plea issues, it is proper to consider the guilty plea transcript as well as evidence at the PCR hearing.Â  Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 133, 318 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1984). \r\nThis Court will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative value to support them.Â  Caprood, 338 S.C. at 109-10, 525 S.E.2d at 517.Â  This Court will reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision when it is controlled by an error of law.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 651, 594 S.E.2d 462, 465 (2004).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge erred in finding plea counselâ€™s performance was deficient.Â  The State contends plea counsel rendered reasonably effective assistance to Respondent despite the fact plea counsel did not advise Respondent that AWIK was a lesser-included offense of ABWIK because AWIK was not a viable lesser-included offense under these facts and circumstances.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nABWIK is an unlawful act of violent nature to the person of another with malice aforethought, either express or implied.Â  ABWIK is commonly described as the following: if the victim had died from the injury, the defendant would have been guilty of murder.Â  State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 396, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285 (2000).Â  In comparison, the elements of AWIK are: (1) an unlawful attempt; (2) to commit a violent injury; (3) to the person of another; (4) with malicious intent; and (5) accompanied by the present ability to complete the act.Â  State v. Burton, 356 S.C 259, 264, 589 S.E.2d 6, 8 (2003).\r\nThe trial court is required to charge a jury on a lesser-included offense â€œif there is any evidence from which it could be inferred the lesser, rather than the greater, offense was committed.â€Â  State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 398, 472 S.E.2d 241, 242 (1996).Â  However, the trial court should refuse to charge on a lesser-included offense where there is no evidence that the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense.Â  State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 549, 446 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1994).Â  \r\nRespondent testified he did not attempt to nor did he hit Lieutenant Bolandâ€™s vehicle.Â  Further, Respondent testified he did not intend to harm or kill Lieutenant Boland, but he intended to flee from the officer.Â  Given Respondentâ€™s testimony, he did not have the requisite intent to satisfy the offense of AWIK.Â  Instead, Respondentâ€™s testimony indicates a jury may have found him not guilty of ABWIK.Â  Furthermore, the evidence indicates there was a collision, and although there may have been a jury issue as to which person struck the otherâ€™s vehicle, there was no dispute that a battery occurred.Â  This evidence is insufficient to suggest Respondent was only guilty of AWIK.Â  See generally State v. Funchess, 267 S.C. 427, 429, 229 S.E.2d 331, 332 (1976) (â€œ[I]t is not error to refuse to submit a lesser included offense unless there is testimony tending to show that the defendant is only guilty of the lesser offense.â€).Â  Therefore, plea counsel was not deficient for failing to advise Respondent of AWIK because Respondent failed to present any evidence that would have entitled him to a charge for AWIK under these facts.Â  Compare Kerrigan v. State, 304 S.C. 561, 563-64, 406 S.E.2d 160, 161-62 (1991) (finding there was evidence in the record that PCR applicant was only guilty of lesser-included offense and holding PCR counsel was ineffective in failing to advise applicant of lesser offense before pleading guilty); see generally Sellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182, 607 S.E.2d 82 (2005) (reversing grant of relief where PCR judge found ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to request jury charges on lesser-included offenses because there was no evidence in the record to support jury charges for lesser-included offenses); Magazine v. State, 361 S.C. 610, 606 S.E.2d 761 (2004) (reversing PCR judgeâ€™s grant of relief where the record was devoid of any evidence warranting a jury charge on the lesser offense).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nNo evidence of probative value supports the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that plea counsel was deficient under these facts.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s grant of a new trial. \r\nREVERSED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26250","title":"Talley v.

Lusk, of Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough, LLP, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This is a post-conviction relief (PCR) case.Â  The PCR judge granted relief to William R. Talley (Respondent).Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari and reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n In 1995, Respondent pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia in magistrateâ€™s court and paid a $200 fine.Â  In 1996, he pled guilty to criminal domestic violence also in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  Respondent received a $940 fine and was sentenced to thirty daysâ€™ imprisonment, immediately suspended on the condition of six monthsâ€™ good behavior.Â  In 2003, Respondent filed this PCR application to set aside the two misdemeanor convictions alleging his federal constitutional right to counsel had been violated because he was not represented by counsel in either conviction.Â  \r\nRespondent is currently serving a 97-month federal sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine and cocaine base.Â  He was assessed two criminal history points for the two state convictions under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.Â  Respondent contends his federal sentence was enhanced by approximately ten months because of these criminal history points.Â  \r\nThe State moved to summarily dismiss Respondentâ€™s PCR application for failure to file within the statute of limitations pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003).[1]Â  Respondent argued his PCR application was timely filed under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(B)[2] because it was filed within one year of Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002).Â  \r\nThe PCR judge denied the motion to dismiss and held Respondent had timely filed his PCR application under Â§ 17-27-45(B) because Shelton created a new rule that must be applied retroactively on collateral review.Â  The PCR judge determined, under Shelton, the constitutional right to counsel applied to Respondentâ€™s convictions and Respondent had not waived the right.Â  The PCR judge concluded Respondentâ€™s right to counsel had been violated in both convictions and vacated Respondentâ€™s convictions. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR judge err in applying Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002), retroactively on collateral review to Respondentâ€™s convictions?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA PCR applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).Â  The Court will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative value to support them.Â  Id. at 109-10, 525 S.E.2d at 517.Â  The Court will reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision when it is controlled by an error of law.Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge erred in applying Shelton retroactively on collateral review to Respondentâ€™s convictions.Â  We conclude the PCR judge correctly determined Shelton must be applied retroactively on collateral review, but erroneously applied Shelton to Respondentâ€™s convictions.Â  \r\nThe State urges us to apply both Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), and State v. Jones, 312 S.C. 100, 439 S.E.2d 282 (1994), to determine whether Shelton should be applied retroactively on collateral review.Â  We disagree.Â  In determining whether Respondent was deprived of his federal constitutional right to counsel, we are required to follow the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decisions on retroactivity.Â  Am. Trucking Assâ€™ns, Inc. v. Smith, 496 U.S. 167, 178, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 2330, 110 L.Ed.2d 148, 159 (1990) (â€œIn order to ensure the uniform application of decisions construing constitutional requirements and to prevent States from denying or curtailing federally protected rights, we have consistently required that state courts adhere to our retroactivity decisions.â€); see also, e.g., State v. Means, 367 S.C. 374, 626 S.E.2d 348 (2006) (applying Jones in determining State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005), should be applied retroactively); State v. Hill, 361 S.C. 297, 604 S.E.2d 696 (2004) (applying Jones in determining State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 532 S.E.2d 283 (2000), should be applied retroactively); Gibson v. State, 355 S.C. 429, 586 S.E.2d 119 (2003) (applying Teague to determine whether Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979), should be applied retroactively on collateral review).Â  \r\nIn general, the question of whether a decision announcing a new rule should be given prospective or retroactive effect should be addressed at the time of the decision.Â  Teague, 489 U.S. at 300, 109 S.Ct. at 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d at 349.Â  â€œ[A] case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government.Â  To put it differently, a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated Â Â Â Â  by precedent existing at the time the defendantâ€™s conviction became Â Â  final.â€Â  Id. at 301, 109 S.Ct. at 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d at 349 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\nIn Shelton, the Supreme Court held the constitutional right to counsel extends to a defendant who receives a â€œsuspended sentence that may â€˜end up in the actual deprivation of a personâ€™s liberty.â€™â€Â  535 U.S. at 658, 122 S.Ct. at 1767, 152 L.Ed.2d at 895 (citing Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 40, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 2014, 32 L.Ed.2d 530, 540 (1972)).[3]Â  The Supreme Court explained: \r\n\r\n  A suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  conviction.Â  Once the prison term is triggered, the defendant is Â Â Â  incarcerated not for the probation violation, but for the underlying Â Â Â  offense.Â  The uncounseled conviction at that point â€œresult[s] in Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  imprisonment. . .;â€ it â€œends up in the actual deprivation of a personâ€™s Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  liberty.â€Â  \r\n\r\nShelton, 535 U.S. at 662, 122 S.Ct. at 1770, 152 L.Ed.2d at 898 (citing Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 746, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 1927, 128 L.Ed.2d 745, 754 (1994) and Argersinger, 407 U.S. at 40, 92 S.Ct. at 2014, 32 L.Ed.2d at 540). Â Â \r\nThe Supreme Court asserted that two prior decisions, Argersinger and Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979), controlled its decision in Shelton.Â  535 U.S. at 657, 122 S.Ct. at 1767, 152 L.Ed.2d at 895.Â  In Argersinger the Supreme Court held â€œthat absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he was represented by counsel at trial.â€Â  407 U.S. at 37, 92 S.Ct. at 2012, 32 L.Ed.2d at 538 (clarifying the scope of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), in which the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendmentâ€™s guarantee of the right of an indigent defendant to appointed counsel applies to state criminal prosecutions through the Fourteenth Amendment).Â  Then in Scott, the Supreme Court noted â€œthe central premise of Argersinger - that actual imprisonment is a penalty different in kind from fines or the mere threat of imprisonment - is eminently sound and warrants adoption of actual imprisonment as the line defining the constitutional right to appointment of counsel.â€Â  440 U.S. at 373, 99 S.Ct. at 1162, 59 L.Ed.2d at 389.Â  The Supreme Court found the constitutional right to counsel does not apply when a prison term is an authorized punishment but not actually imposed. Â Id. at 369, 99 S.Ct. at 1160, 59 L.Ed.2d at 386.\r\nAlthough the Supreme Court in Shelton found the Argersinger-Scott â€œactual imprisonmentâ€ rule controlling, â€œthe fact that a court says that its decision is within the â€˜logical compassâ€™ of an earlier decision, or indeed that it is â€˜controlledâ€™ by a prior decision, is not conclusive for purposes of deciding whether the current decision is a â€˜new ruleâ€™ under Teague.â€Â  Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 415, 110 S.Ct. 1212, 1217, 108 L.Ed.2d 347, 356 (1990).Â  Precedent prior to Shelton established that a defendant was entitled to the constitutional right to counsel when the defendant received a sentence â€œthat end[s] up in the actual deprivation of a personâ€™s liberty.â€Â  Argersinger, 407 U.S. at 40, 92 S.Ct. at 2014, 32 L.Ed.2d at 540.Â  However, the Shelton decision required counsel to be appointed when an indigent defendant received a sentence that â€œmay end up in the actual deprivation of a personâ€™s liberty.â€Â  Shelton, 535 U.S. at 658, 122 S.Ct. at 1767, 152 L.Ed.2d 895 (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis added).Â  Sheltonâ€™s extension of the right to counsel was a new rule under Teague because it was not dictated by precedent existing at the time of Respondentâ€™s convictions.Â  See also Howard v. United States, 374 F.3d 1068, 1074-77 (11th Cir. 2004) (finding Shelton announced a new rule under Teague).Â  \r\nGenerally, new procedural rules should be not applied retroactively to cases on collateral review, unless the new rule falls within one of two exceptions to the general rule.Â  Teague, 489 U.S. at 305, 310, 109 S.Ct. at 1072, 103 L.Ed.2d at 352, 356.Â  The first exception is when the rule â€œplaces certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe.â€ Â Id. at 311, 109 S.Ct. at 1075, 103 L.Ed.2d at 356 (internal quotation omitted).Â  The second exception is when the rule â€œrequires the observance of those procedures thatâ€¦are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.â€Â  Id. at 311, 109 S.Ct. at 1076, 103 L.Ed.2d at 356 (internal quotations omitted).Â  The second exception is â€œreserved for watershed rules of criminal procedureâ€ which implicate the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the proceeding.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe first exception is not applicable to the present situation.Â  The Supreme Court has repeatedly cited Gideon as illustrative of the type of new rule which falls within the second exception in Teague.Â  See, e.g., Beard v. Banks, 542 U.S. 406, 124 S.Ct. 2504, 159 L.Ed.2d 494 (2004) (recognizing the right to counsel announced in Gideon as an example of the second Teague exception); Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990) (same); Teague, 489 U.S. at 311-312, 109 S.Ct. at 1075-76, 103 L.Ed.2d at 357 (same).Â  The Supreme Court also has applied each extension of the constitutional right to counsel retroactively to collateral proceedings.Â  We conclude the new rule announced by Shelton is a watershed rule of criminal proceeding because the right to counsel undeniably implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the proceeding.Â  See Howard, 374 F.3d at 1077-80 (collecting authority which supports retroactive application of every extension of right to counsel on collateral review but noting these decisions were decided prior to Teague and concluding Shelton fell within the second Teague exception because of â€œthe sheer importance of the right to counselâ€).\r\nBecause Shelton applies retroactively on collateral review, the PCR judge correctly determined S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(B) is the applicable statute of limitations.Â  Shelton was decided on May 20, 2002, and Respondent filed his PCR application on March 6, 2003.Â  Respondentâ€™s PCR application was timely filed under Â§ 17-27-45(B).\r\nAlthough Respondent timely filed his PCR application and Shelton applies retroactively on collateral review, we conclude the rule announced in Shelton does not apply to Respondentâ€™s convictions.Â  Respondent only paid a fine for his conviction in 1995.Â  A fine for an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid, and Respondent did not have a constitutional right to counsel for this conviction.Â  See Scott, 440 U.S. at 373-74, 99 S.Ct. at 1162, 59 L.Ed.2d at 389.Â  Accordingly, the PCR judge erred in vacating the 1995 conviction.Â  \r\nRespondent received thirty daysâ€™ imprisonment, which was immediately suspended and conditioned on six monthsâ€™ good behavior, and was fined $940 for his 1996 conviction.Â  In South Carolina, a magistrate cannot lawfully place a person on probation.Â  A magistrate can, however, lawfully suspend a sentence and impose conditions.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-800 (Supp. 2005) (â€œNotwithstanding the limitations of Sections 17-25-100 and 24-21-410, after a conviction or plea for an offense within a magistrateâ€™s jurisdiction the magistrate at the time of sentence may suspend the imposition or execution of a sentence upon terms and conditions the magistrate considers appropriate. . . .Nothing in this section may be construed to give a magistrate the right to place a person on probation.â€).Â  Although a magistrate has the statutory authorization to suspend sentences and impose conditional sentences, we note the enforcement of substantive conditions as part of a suspended sentence may implicate a defendantâ€™s right to counsel as required by Argersinger, Scott, and Shelton.Â  In this case, the magistrateâ€™s condition of six monthsâ€™ good behavior was effectively probation, and accordingly, the probation was an illegal sentence.Â  We vacate that portion of Respondentâ€™s sentence for his 1996 conviction.[4]Â  \r\nTherefore, Respondent lawfully received a prison sentence that was immediately suspended and a fine for his 1996 conviction.Â  If a defendant receives only an immediately suspended sentence without probation, there is absolutely no possibility the defendant will ever be incarcerated for the underlying conviction.Â  As such, the prison term for the underlying conviction will never be triggered, and the defendant has not received a sentence that â€œmay â€˜end up in the actual deprivation of a personâ€™s liberty.â€™â€Â  Shelton, 535 U.S. at 658, 122 S.Ct. at 1767, 152 L.Ed.2d at 895 (citing Argersinger, 407 U.S. at 40, 92 S.Ct. at 2014, 32 L.Ed.2d at 540).Â  Because Respondent received an immediately suspended sentence and a fine, we conclude the federal constitutional right to counsel did not apply to Respondentâ€™s conviction in 1996 and the PCR judge erroneously ruled Respondentâ€™s conviction was invalid under Shelton.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision to vacate Respondentâ€™s convictions and uphold those convictions.Â  We need not reach the remaining issue on appeal.Â  See Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711 (2005) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654 (2002) should be applied retroactively, and I agree that decision affords Respondent no relief on his 1995 conviction.Â  I disagree, however, with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that the 1996 sentence was, at least in part, illegal and would affirm the grant of post-conviction relief (PCR) to Respondent on that conviction.\r\nThe majority holds, and I agree, that a magistrate cannot lawfully place a criminal defendant on probation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-800 (1989) (â€œNothing in this section may be construed to give a magistrate the right to place a person on probationâ€).Â  Here, the magistrate did not place Respondent on probation but instead suspended his sentence, conditioned on six months good behavior.Â  Such a suspension is explicitly authorized by Â§ 22-3-800: â€œ[T]he magistrate at the time of sentence may suspend the imposition or execution of a sentence upon terms and conditions the magistrate considers appropriateâ€¦.â€Â  A suspended sentence conditioned upon good behavior â€œis independent of the Probation and Parole Statutes and suspension of sentences therein providedâ€¦.â€Â  Richards v. Crump, 260 S.C. 133, 194 S.E.2d 575 (1973).[5]Â  I find nothing illegal about the 1996 sentence[6] and conclude that it was obtained in violation of the rule in Alabama v. Shelton.\r\nI therefore concur in part and dissent in part.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Section 17-27-45(A) provides: \r\n\r\n  An application for relief filed pursuant to this chapter must be filed Â Â Â  within one year after the entry of a judgment of conviction or within Â  one year after the sending of the remittitur to the lower court from an Â Â Â Â Â Â  appeal or the filing of the final decision upon an appeal, whichever is Â Â Â  later.\r\n\r\nIn Peloquin v. State, 321 S.C. 468, 469 S.E.2d 606 (1996), the Court held that all defendants convicted prior to July 1, 1995, the effective date of Â§ 17-27-45, must be allowed until July 1, 1996, to file a PCR application.\r\n[2]Â  Section 17-27-45(B) provides: \r\n\r\n  When a court whose decisions are binding upon the Supreme Court of this State or the Supreme Court of this State holds that the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of South Carolina, or both, Â  impose upon state criminal proceedings a substantive standard not previously recognized or a right not in existence at the time of the state court trial, and if the standard or right is intended to be applied  retroactively, an application under this chapter may be filed not later than one year after the date on which the standard or right was determined to exist.\r\n\r\n[3] Â The defendant in Shelton was convicted of a misdemeanor; was sentenced to thirty daysâ€™ imprisonment, which was immediately suspended; and was placed on unsupervised probation for two years.\r\n[4]Â Â  The dissent relies on dicta in Richards v. Crump, 260 S.C. 133, 194 S.E.2d 575 (1973), to allege that a suspended sentence conditioned on good behavior is independent of probation.Â  The issue in Richards was whether a magistrate could lawfully impose consecutive sentences, and in that context, the Richards Court differentiated between consecutive and suspended sentences.\r\n[5] I note that in Richards the parties conceded that a magistrate could not suspend sentences and thus it does not support the majorityâ€™s holding that a magistrate lacks this authority.Â  I note as well that the opinion makes no mention of Â§ 43-67.1, the predecessor to Â§ 22-3-800 then in effect.\r\n[6] I n my view, if in fact the original sentence were unlawful, then the suspension would be a nullity and Respondent would be required to serve the original thirty day sentence.Â  As such, the 1996 conviction was obtained in violation of Argesinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972), and PCR was properly granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26251","title":"Franklin v.

Lydon, of McAngus Goudelock &amp; Courie, LLC, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  We accepted this case in our original jurisdiction to consider whether respondent Ernest Chavisâ€™s involvement in drafting a will and other documents for decedent Annie Belle Weiss constituted the unauthorized practice of law.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioners, who are Ms. Weissâ€™s grandnieces, commenced the underlying action[1] contesting her will on grounds of undue influence and lack of capacity.Â  Ms. Weiss was ninety-one years old and in the hospital when she signed this will on July 31, 2004.Â  Petitioners claim Michael Lehman, Ms. Weissâ€™s nephew by marriage, took advantage of her condition to influence her to make this will leaving 60% of her estate[2] to Lehman and only 10% to each of Ms. Weissâ€™s three grandnieces and their mother, Lynn Franklin.[3]Â  Respondent, a former neighbor of Ms. Weiss, drafted this will.Â  The will names respondent as personal representative of Ms. Weissâ€™s estate but he is not a beneficiary.[4]\r\nRespondent also drafted a power of attorney that Ms. Weiss signed along with the July 31 will.Â  This document names respondent as her attorney-in-fact.Â  Respondent used this power of attorney before Ms. Weissâ€™s death to close a real estate transaction on her behalf.Â  Ms. Weiss died on September 27, 2004.\r\nThe third document in question is a Renunciation of Administration regarding the estate of Ms. Weissâ€™s daughter, Sara Crossman, who died in May 2004.Â  Ms. WeissÂ  signed this document on September 14, 2004, relinquishing her right to act as personal representative for Saraâ€™s estate and nominating respondent to act in that capacity.Â  Ms. Weiss also signed a waiver of bond form for Saraâ€™s estate enabling respondent to serve without posting bond. \r\nThe action before us seeks a declaration that respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by drafting the July 31 will, the power of attorney, and the two probate forms; a declaration that all these documents are void; an injunction; and restitution.Â  The record is replete with claims of misconduct that are relevant only to issues pending in the underlying action regarding undue influence and lack of capacity.Â  We limit the facts here to those relevant to the claim that respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;Did respondent engage in the unauthorized practice of law?\r\n  2.Â What relief is appropriate?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Unauthorized practice of law\r\nPetitioners assert respondent engaged in the practice of law by giving legal advice and preparing the above-mentioned legal documents on Ms. Weissâ€™s behalf. Â Â Respondent contends he acted as a mere scrivener.Â  \r\na. Drafting of July 31 will\r\nRespondent testified that he visited Ms. Weiss socially at her home on July 20, 2004.Â  Respondent is an insurance agent by trade and previously had business dealings with Ms. Weiss.Â  During this visit, Ms. Weiss asked respondent, â€œCan you help me make a will?â€Â  Respondent agreed to help her with a simple will.Â  Ms. Weiss told him she wanted â€œsomebody objectiveâ€ and she directed respondent as to how she wanted her property divided.Â  Respondent used a â€œQuicken lawyer diskâ€ to generate a generic will on his home computer and he filled in the blanks.Â  He brought the will to Ms. Weiss on July 31 when he went to visit her in the hospital and she signed it.Â  \r\nThe preparation of legal documents constitutes the practice of law when such preparation involves the giving of advice, consultation, explanation, or recommendations on matters of law.Â  State v. Despain, 319 S.C. 317, 319, 460 S.E.2d 576, 578 (1995).Â  Even the preparation of standard forms that require no creative drafting may constitute the practice of law if one acts as more than a mere scrivener.Â  See State v. Buyers Service Co., 292 S.C. 426, 430, 357 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1987).Â  The purpose of prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law is to protect the public from incompetence in the preparation of legal documents and prevent harm resulting from inaccurate legal advice.Â  Housing Auth. of City of Charleston v. Key, 352 S.C. 26, 572 S.E.2d 284 (2002); see also In re: Baker, 85 A.2d 505, 514 (N.J. 1951) (â€œThe amateur at law is as dangerous to the community as an amateur surgeon . . . .â€).\r\nThe novel question here is whether respondentâ€™s actions in filling in the blanks in a computer-generated generic will constitute the practice of law.Â  Respondent selected the will form, filled in the information given by Ms. Weiss, and arranged the execution of the will at the hospital.Â  Although these facts are not in themselves conclusive, the omission of facts indicating Ms. Weissâ€™s involvement is significant.Â  There is no evidence Ms. Weiss reviewed the will once it was typed.Â  The will was not typed in her presence and although respondent relates the details of what Ms. Weiss told him to do, there is no indication he contemporaneously recorded her instructions and then simply transferred the information to the form.Â  \r\nWe construe the role of â€œscrivenerâ€ in this context to mean someone who does nothing more than record verbatim what the decedent says.Â  We conclude respondentâ€™s actions in drafting Ms. Weissâ€™s will exceeded those of a mere scrivener and he engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.[5]\r\nb.Â  Drafting power of attorney\r\nRespondent drafted a document entitled â€œGeneral Power of Attorneyâ€ for Ms. Weiss naming respondent as her attorney-in-fact allowing him on her behalf to:Â  1) open, maintain, or close financial accounts including access to safe deposit boxes; 2) sell property; 3) purchase insurance; 4) collect debts and settle claims; 5) enter contracts; 6) exercise stock rights; 7) maintain or operate business; 8) employ professional and business assistance; 9) sell, lease, mortgage and other acts regarding real estate; 10) prepare, sign, and file documents.Â  \r\nRespondent testified at his deposition that he drafted the power of attorney around July 20 because Ms. Weiss asked him to represent her regarding the sale of some of her real estate.Â  Ms. Weiss signed the power of attorney at the hospital on July 31.Â  It was filed on August 4.Â  Respondent used the power of attorney to close the sale of Ms. Weissâ€™s real estate on August 26, about a month before her death.\r\nThere are no details regarding respondentâ€™s drafting of this document.Â  It uses legal phrasing with two pages of text and is not a simple form with filled-in blanks.Â  The document itself confers wide-ranging legal rights and would clearly require legal advice in its preparation.Â  We conclude respondent engaged in the practice of law in drafting this document.Â  \r\nc. Probate forms\r\nThe Renunciation of Right to Administration and the Statement of Agreement to Waive Bond are probate court forms with handwritten information filled in the blanks.Â  While these forms do have legal implications, they are straight-forward and are provided to the public by the court.Â  These simple forms are clearly distinguishable from the will and power of attorney discussed above.Â  Respondent basically inserted names, addresses, and dates.Â  There is no evidence respondent gave legal advice to Ms. Weiss regarding these forms.Â  We find there is no factual support for the claim that respondent engaged in the practice of law by filling out these forms.Â  See Shortz v. Farrell, 193 A. 20 (Pa. 1937) (filling in simple forms provided by tribunal not unauthorized practice of law).\r\n2.Â  Relief \r\nPetitioners ask this Court to enjoin respondent from the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Respondent states that he has no intention of assisting others in any matters related to wills or powers of attorney and therefore he does not object to an injunction.Â  \r\nPetitioners further assert that because respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in drafting Ms. Weissâ€™s will, he should be removed as personal representative.Â  We decline to order petitionerâ€™s removal based on the record before us[6] but conclude respondent should receive no fee for his services as personal representative of the Weiss estate.Â  In Linder v. Ins. Claims Consultants, Inc., 348 S.C. 477, 560 S.E.2d 612 (2002), we addressed the activities of public insurance adjusters and determined that those functions constituting the unauthorized practice of law should not be compensated.Â  Here, although respondent was not compensated for drafting the will, he is entitled to a statutory amount of compensation up to 5% of the appraised value of the estate for his services as personal representative.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-719 (Supp. 2005).Â  Respondentâ€™s entitlement to a fee as personal representative flows directly from his unauthorized practice of law in drafting a will naming himself as personal representative.Â  Accordingly, respondent shall not receive any fee as personal representative of the Weiss estate and shall disgorge any fee received thus far.\r\nPetitioners also complain that respondent is using estate funds to defend the action below which challenges the will on the ground of undue influence.Â  This is a legitimate use of estate funds under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-720 (1987) which allows for the expenses of estate litigation to be paid by the estate.Â  The lower court may determine that respondent should be liable for these expenses depending upon its findings in the underlying action.\r\nPetitioners contend the will drafted by respondent should be declared void.Â  We disagree.Â  The claims of undue influence and lack of capacity, which would invalidate Ms. Weissâ€™s will, are issues to be resolved in the underlying action.Â  If the July 31 will was in fact drafted pursuant to Ms. Weissâ€™s true wishes, it should not be invalidated simply because it was drafted by a nonlawyer.Â  Accord In re: Petersonâ€™s Estate, 42 N.W.2d 59 (Minn. 1950) (refusing to void a will whose validity was challenged on the ground it was drafted by a nonlawyer because testator should not be penalized by having his will declared void).[7] Â Â \r\nFinally, petitioners ask us to order restitution for alleged financial missteps by respondent in managing the Weiss and Crossman assets.Â  There is no private right of action in South Carolina for the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Linder v. Ins. Claims Consultants, Inc., supra.Â  Petitionersâ€™ claim for restitution is based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty and is not appropriate relief in an action based on the unauthorized practice of law.\r\nRELIEF GRANTED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The action was commenced in probate court and removed by consent to circuit court.\r\n[2]The net worth of the estate is $897,890.Â  \r\n[3]Lynn Franklin is the daughter of Ms. Weissâ€™s sister. \r\n[4]Only a month earlier, on June 25th, Ms. Weiss signed a will prepared by her lawyer that names Lynn Franklin as personal representative and Lehman as the alternate.Â  This will was more favorable to petitioners.\r\n[5]The fact that respondent received no compensation is irrelevant.Â  Housing Auth. of City of Charleston v. Key, 352 S.C. 26, 572 S.E.2d 284 (2002).Â  One court has noted that a lack of compensation in fact makes the situation worse.\r\n\r\n  Indeed, the public may well be in greater need of protection from the unauthorized practice of law where it seems to be done without charge than where a charge is openly made for the services.Â  In the former situation, the public, through natural cupidity, are the more readily attracted to something which appears to be a â€œgiveawayâ€ project or a chance to obtain â€œsomething for nothing.â€\r\n\r\nGrievance Committee of the Bar of Fairfield County v. Dacey, 222 A.2d 339, 351 (Conn. 1966). \r\n[6]Removal for cause is provided by statute under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-611 (1987), a remedy petitioners are free to request in the underlying action.Â  \r\n[7]Regarding the power of attorney, it is no longer valid since Ms. Weiss is deceased.Â  Further, petitioners do not contest the real estate transaction accomplished pursuant to the power of attorney and there is nothing to be achieved by voiding the power of attorney now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26252","title":"State v.

Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant John New was convicted of two counts of hostage-taking and one count of unlawfully carrying a weapon while an inmate.Â  He was sentenced consecutively to two life sentences without parole and ten years.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe charges stemmed from a hostage situation at Lee Correctional Institute which occurred on September 8, 1999.Â  Employees Janie Mathis and Jane Gardner were held in an administrative office after appellant and another inmate, Wesley Floyd, burst in on them.Â  Appellant put a knife to Ms. Mathisâ€™s throat and threatened to harm her unless the building was cleared immediately.Â  He demanded that pizza be delivered and said he wanted to speak with the warden.Â  After several hours, negotiators were finally able to convince the inmates to release their hostages unharmed.Â  Both victims testified that appellant was the decision-maker and in control of the situation, and that only appellant had a weapon.Â  \r\nAppellant testified to the contrary that Floyd was the leader and appellant had no choice but to do as Floyd directed.Â  Floyd, a convicted murderer, had threatened appellantâ€™s life several times because appellant was indebted to Floyd for drugs.Â  On the day in question, Floyd came to appellantâ€™s cell and told him what they were going to do.Â  Appellant was afraid for his life because Floyd carried a razor blade in his mouth.[1]Â  Based on the evidence, the trial judge gave a charge on duress.Â  Â \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial judge err in charging that appellant had the burden of proving his defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOver appellantâ€™s objection, the trial judge charged it was appellantâ€™s burden to prove his defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Appellant contends that, based on our holding in State v. Addison, 343 S.C. 290, 540 S.E.2d 449 (2001), the State should have the burden of disproving duress.Â  In Addison we held in the context of self-defense that the defendant is entitled to a charge, if requested, that the State bears the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.[2]Â  Appellant argues the same rule should apply here. Â \r\nState courts differ on the issue whether the State is required to disprove duress beyond a reasonable doubt;[3] however, the United States Supreme Court has recently held that due process does not require such a charge.Â  Dixon v. United States, ___ U.S. ___ , 126 S.Ct. 2437 (2006).Â  In Dixon, the Court reasoned that the prosecution need not bear the burden of disproving duress beyond a reasonable doubt because â€œthe existence of duress normally does not controvert any of the elements of the offense itself.â€Â  126 S.Ct. at 2441.Â  The Court noted that even though the defense of duress allows the defendant to avoid criminal liability, the crime was still knowingly committed.Â  Dixon resolved a conflict among the federal courts reflecting the widespread disagreement, as noted by one court, on the â€œphilosophicalâ€ question regarding whether duress negates the mens rea of the crime or whether it simply excuses the crime because it is motivated by self-preservation.Â  See United States v. Mitchell, 725 F.2d 832 (2d Cir. 1983). \r\nWe find the rationale of Dixon persuasive.Â  Duress excuses the crime but does not negate any element of the offense.Â  See State v. Rocheville, 310 S.C. 20, 425 S.E.2d 32 (1993) (duress does not negate element of malice in murder charge); State v. Robinson, 294 S.C. 120, 363 S.E.2d 104 (1987) (duress envisions a third person compelling another to commit a crime).Â  Self-defense, on the other hand, goes to an element of the crime.Â  See State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 589 S.E.2d 1 (2003) (the â€œno faultâ€ element of self-defense opposes intent element of mutual combat); State v. Merriman, 34 S.C. 16, 12 S.E. 619, 622 (1891) (self-defense negates element of malice).Â  Accordingly, the fact that the State has the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt does not compel the conclusion that the same applies to the defense of duress. \r\nGenerally, affirmative defenses must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  State v. Attardo, 263 S.C. 546, 211 S.E.2d 868 (1975).Â  We hold the trial judge properly charged the jury that appellant had the burden to prove his defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]At his first trial on these charges, appellant blamed a different inmate and testified that Floyd was his friend.Â  He claimed here that he lied because Floyd was present at the first trial.\r\n[2]The failure to give such a charge is not cured by a general charge that the State bears the burden of proving the defendantâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298 (2002). \r\n[3]Compare State v. Fuller, 506 A.2d 556 (Conn. 1986); State v. B.H., 834 A.2d 1063 (N.J. 2003); State v. Culp, 900 S.W.2d 707 (Tenn. App. 1994) (State has burden of disproving duress) and State v. Jeffrey, 50 P.3d 861 (Ariz. 2003); State v. Riker, 869 P.2d 43 (Wash. 1994); Moes v.

Creech, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26253\r\nSubmitted December 7, 2006 - Filed January 22, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        David Emil Arnal, of Marietta, Georgia, pro se.\r\n        Donald B. Clark, Susan C. Rosen, and Robert N. Rosen, all of Rosen Law Firm, LLC, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n        Ralph E. Tupper, of Tupper Grimsley, Dean, PA, of Beaufort, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  We certified David Arnalâ€™s (Fatherâ€™s) four appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and consolidated them for briefing purposes.Â  Father raises six issues arising out of four family court orders.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Laura Lawton Fraser (Mother) were divorced by order of the family court on October 17, 2001.Â  The amended final order awarded custody of the partiesâ€™ minor child, Samuel, to Mother, granted visitation to Father, required Father to pay child support, divided marital property, and addressed all other issues between the parties.\r\nFather and Mother cross-appealed a total of sixteen issues arising out of the amended final order, and the Court of Appeals resolved these issues in Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 609 S.E.2d 821 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Mother petitioned this Court, and we granted certiorari to address five issues from the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision. Â This Court affirmed the Court of Appeals with modification in Arnal v. Arnal, Op. No. 26215 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed October 23, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 40 at 27) (â€œfirst appealâ€).\r\nWhile the first appeal was pending, Father filed the current action (Case No. 2003-DR-07-183) in the Beaufort County family court on February 10, 2003.Â  In his complaint, Father requested modification of his child support obligation and asked for more control over health-care decisions for Samuel, who has Downâ€™s syndrome.Â  \r\nAfter this action was filed in February 2003, numerous hearings have been held to address emergency motions and rule to show cause actions filed by both parties.Â  The four appealed orders stem from these hearings.\r\nThe first order suspended Fatherâ€™s overnight visitation upon Motherâ€™s motion.Â  Mother alleged Father violated previous court orders[1] by failing to videotape the administration of medications to Samuel.Â  \r\nThe second order addressed Motherâ€™s claim that Father failed to reimburse Samuelâ€™s uncovered medical expenses as required by the final divorce order.Â  The family court found Father owed Mother for uncovered medical expenses previously incurred, and the court ordered both parents to pay in advance for language tutoring and other educational expenses.Â  \r\nIn the third order, the family court found Father to be in contempt for (a) failing to provide proof of valid life insurance as required by the amended final order; (b) failing to comply with a prior order compelling discovery; and (c) failing to comply with prior orders requiring Father to videotape medicine administration.Â  The court then sentenced Father to a period of incarceration not to exceed six months for each finding of contempt but allowed Father to purge these sentences by complying with the prior orders.\r\nOne of the conditions attached to Fatherâ€™s purging of his contempt sentence was, â€œIf Father fails to provide the required video to Mother on any occasion within the following twelve (12) months after the issuance of this order, a warrant shall be issued for his arrest for failure to meet the conditions to purge the contempt.â€Â  Father initially complied with the conditions for purging his contempt sentence and avoided incarceration.\r\nThe fourth order appealed by Father was the issuance of a bench warrant for contempt.Â  Based upon affidavits by Mother and the guardian ad litem (GAL), the family court found that Father failed to comply with the provisions of the third order by not properly videotaping the medication administration within the twelve month period as required under the third order.Â  The warrant has been stayed while this appeal was pending.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Should the current action (2003-DR-07-183) filed by Father, requesting child support modification and more control in Samuelâ€™s health-care decisions, be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?Â  If so, should the Court void and vacate all orders issued in this action?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court abuse its discretion by ordering Father to pay uncovered medical expenses as a result of Motherâ€™s rule to show cause actions to enforce the final divorce order, when Father claims such expenses were not proper, reasonable, or necessary?\r\n III.Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err by ordering Father to pay educational and other non-medical expenses?\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Did the family court abuse its discretion by terminating Fatherâ€™s overnight visitation?\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err in refusing to appoint a medical GAL for Samuel?\r\nVI.Â Â Â Â  Were the contempt sentence and requirements for purging in the third order, along with the subsequent order issuing a bench warrant for Fatherâ€™s arrest, an unconstitutional violation of Fatherâ€™s due process rights?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIssue I:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction[2]\r\nBoth parties briefed the issue of subject matter jurisdiction by analyzing the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-782 to -830 (1985) (â€œUCCJAâ€) and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A (2000) (â€œPKPAâ€).Â  As discussed below, the jurisdictional issues in this case are governed by Rule 205, SCACR, and by Rule 225, SCACR.Â  \r\nFather contends that the UCCJA and the PKPA prohibit the Beaufort County family court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over the current modification action.Â  He argues that all orders should be voided and vacated because, by the time this action was filed in February 2003, Father had moved to Georgia while Mother and Samuel lived in North Carolina.Â  We disagree.\r\nBoth the PKPA and the UCCJA govern jurisdictional disputes between courts of different states when multiple states claim jurisdiction over a custody or child visitation dispute.[3]Â  In this case, however, no other state is competing with South Carolina for jurisdiction, and the current action does not include a child custody dispute.Â  Instead, both parties rely on a Court of Appeals decision which addressed subject matter jurisdiction under the PKPA and UCCJA in a situation similar to the present case, i.e. neither parents nor child resided in South Carolina and no other state was competing for jurisdiction.Â  Widdicombe v. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C. 75, 620 S.E.2d 333 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, Widdicombe only addressed custody, whereas custody has never been an issue in this case or in the first appeal.Â  \r\nNeither the PKPA nor the UCCJA apply to the specific issues raised here.Â  The jurisdictional issues in this case are governed by Rule 205 and by Rule 225, SCACR.\r\nRule 205, SCACR, provides the appellate court with exclusive jurisdiction over matters on appeal.Â  The lower court may only proceed with matters not affected by the appeal.Â  Rule 225(a), SCACR, in governing matters which are stayed while on appeal, provides:\r\n\r\n  As a general rule, the service of a notice of appeal in a civil matter acts to automatically stay matters decided in the order on appeal, and to automatically stay the relief ordered in the appealed order, judgment, or decree.Â  This automatic stay continues in effect for the duration of the appeal unless lifted by order of the trial judge, appellate court, or judge or justice thereof.Â  The lower court retains jurisdiction over matters not affected by the appeal including the authority to enforce any matters not stayed by the appeal.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Under Rule 205 and the last sentence of the above-quoted portion of Rule 225, the lower court may not act or issue orders that affect an issue on appeal.[4]Â  Under Rule 225, the lower court may act only to enforce matters not stayed by the appeal.\r\nBecause Fatherâ€™s payment of child support and medical expenses as required by the final divorce order were not stayed by the appeal, [5] the family court retained jurisdiction to enforce those payments.Â  However, the family court did not have jurisdiction to modify matters in the final divorce order that were on appeal.Â  Rule 205, SCACR; See also Wingate v. Wingate, 289 S.C. 574, 347 S.E.2d 878 (1986) (because alimony was an issue on appeal from the divorce decree, the Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the alimony issue, and the family court was without jurisdiction to change the amount of alimony during the pending appeal).\r\nAccordingly, we cannot say that all orders in the present action are void for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Each contention made by Father must be analyzed to determine whether the family courtâ€™s decision was affected by a matter on appeal or whether Mother simply sought to enforce the amended final order.Â  \r\nIssue II:Â Â Â Â Â  Uncovered Medical ExpensesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the final divorce order, Mother was given complete authority to make all decisions regarding Samuelâ€™s medical and educational needs.Â  Father was required to pay his pro-rata share of 64.4% of the uncovered medical expenses.Â  Because this payment was not stayed pursuant to Rule 225(b)(6), SCACR, Father was required to pay these medical expenses, and the family court retained jurisdiction to enforce this provision during the appeal.Â  \r\nAlthough the issue of apportioning medical expenses from the final divorce order was on appeal, Father did not seek to modify his obligation in the present case, and this dispute did not affect a matter on appeal.Â  Instead, Father asked the family court to determine whether the medical expenses previously submitted by Mother were subject to the provisions of the final order.Â  This issue could be addressed by the family court under Rule 205 and under Rule 225, SCACR.\r\nFather contends that the order directing him to pay or reimburse Mother for uncovered medical expenses constituted an abuse of discretion.Â  He argues that these medical expenses were not reasonable for several reasons and claims he should not have to pay for unconventional and unnecessary treatment.Â  Father also argues that he should not have to pay medical expenses that are not submitted to insurance providers. Â We disagree.\r\nAfter a hearing on the issue of medical expenses, the family court determined that the medical expenses were reasonable and proper under the final divorce order.Â  Father offered numerous reasons why the expenses did not fall under the scope of the final order, and the family court disagreed and ordered Father to pay his required share.Â  Although this Court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we should not disregard the findings of the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999).Â  The family court did not abuse its discretion by finding Fatherâ€™s payment of the requested medical expenses to be enforceable under the final divorce order.\r\nIssue III:Â Â Â Â  Educational and Non-medical Expenses\r\nThe amended final order specifically declined to address educational expenses.Â  Because these types of expenses were not dealt with in the final order, this matter was not affected by the appeal, and Rules 205 and 225, SCACR, would not prohibit the family court from exercising jurisdiction over this issue.\r\nFather argues that the family court erred by requiring Father to pay his share of Samuelâ€™s educational expenses such as language and speech tutoring and early education training.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court did not abuse its discretion by requiring both parents to split the costs for these expenses.Â  The order required both parents to pay for language tutoring and therapist bills in advance, and the family court did not abuse its discretion in finding these expenses appropriate to Samuelâ€™s care.Â  \r\nIssue IV:Â Â Â Â  Termination of Overnight Visitation\r\nFather contends that the family court erred in terminating his overnight visitation for failing to meet the videotaping requirements mandated by the family court.Â  We agree, due to the jurisdictional bar of Rule 205 and Rule 225, SCACR.\r\nThe final divorce order set very specific parameters for Fatherâ€™s visitation.Â  Father appealed the portion of the final order to the Court of Appeals concerning summer and holiday visitation.Â  Thus, the family court would not have jurisdiction to modify terms of visitation because the appellate court would have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter on appeal. [6]Â  \r\nThe family court modified Fatherâ€™s visitation while the first appeal was pending.Â  By first requiring Father to videotape the administration of medicine as a condition of his visitation, and then by suspending Fatherâ€™s overnight visitation for failure to comply with the videotaping conditions, the family court violated our appellate court rules by issuing orders that were affected by a matter on appeal. Â Therefore, the order that suspended overnight visitation was void for lack of jurisdiction.\r\nIssue V:Â Â Â Â Â  Medical GAL\r\nFather argues the family court erred in refusing to appoint a medical GAL.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe authority to appoint a GAL solely for medical determinations comes from S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1545 (Supp. 2005).Â  That statute gives the family court absolute discretion in determining who will serve as a GAL.Â  Furthermore, the family court may appoint a GAL without consent of both parties when â€œthe court will likely not be fully informed about the facts of the case and there is a substantial dispute which necessitates a guardian ad litem.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1545(A)(1).Â  \r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1549 (Supp. 2005), the duties and responsibilities of a GAL already include authority to review medical records and the duty to conduct an independent, balanced, and impartial investigation of facts relevant to the situation of the child and the family.Â  Accordingly, the failure of the family court to appoint a GAL strictly for medical advisement did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\r\nIssue VI:Â Â Â Â  Civil Contempt and Conditions of Purging\r\nFather contends that the contempt sentence and purging provisions of the two orders by Judge Creech are unconstitutional violations of Fatherâ€™s rights.Â  We believe the contempt sentence was improperly based on an order for which no jurisdiction existed under Rule 225, SCACR.Â  Therefore, we reverse the finding of contempt, but we decline to address Fatherâ€™s constitutional arguments.\r\nThe finding of contempt against Father stems from his repeated failure to properly videotape the administration of Samuelâ€™s medicine.Â  As previously discussed, the initial order requiring Father to videotape the giving of medicine is void for lack of jurisdiction because that order modified the terms of Fatherâ€™s visitation, an issue which was being appealed.Â  Father cannot be held in contempt for violating an order which was void ab initio for a lack of jurisdiction.Â  See Luthi v. Luthi, 297 S.C. 306, 376 S.E.2d 782 (Ct. App. 1989) (during husbandâ€™s appeal of an equitable division award to former wife, the lower courtâ€™s order that the monetary equitable division award to former wife was a properly enrolled money judgment was void for lack of jurisdiction; as a result, the subsequent order awarding interest on the judgment was also invalid).\r\nBecause the contempt issue can be resolved without reaching Fatherâ€™s due process claims, we decline to address the constitutional issues raised by Father.Â  It is our firm policy to decline to rule on constitutional issues unless such a ruling is required.Â  In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe four appealed orders in this case are not automatically void pursuant to the UCCJA and the PKPA.Â  Our appellate court rules control whether the issues were properly before the family court while the first appeal was pending.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s order requiring Father to pay his share of medical expenses, and we affirm the order requiring both parents to share non-medical and educational expenses.Â  We also affirm the denial of Fatherâ€™s request for a medical GAL.Â  Finally, we reverse the suspension of Fatherâ€™s overnight visitation, and we also reverse the finding of contempt for violating an order that was void for lack of jurisdiction.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C. J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The previous family court orders requiring videotaping were both issued while the first appeal was pending.Â  \r\n[2] Father raises the issue of subject matter jurisdiction for the first time on appeal.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including on appeal.Â  State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377 (2004).\r\n[3] See 28 U.S.C. 1738A(a); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788(a) (â€œA court of this State which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree ifâ€¦â€) (emphasis added); Clay v. Burckle, 369 S.C. 651, 633 S.E.2d 173 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œThe PKPA and UCCJA govern the subject matter jurisdiction of state courts to rule in interstate custody disputes.â€) (emphasis added); Kirylik v. Kirylik, 292 S.C. 475, 477, 357 S.E.2d 449, 450 (1987) (stating that UCCJA was enacted to prevent conflicting custody decrees between different states).\r\n[4] A party can always seek a remand from an appellate court if the circumstances of the particular case require it.\r\n[5] â€œFamily court orders regarding a child or requiring payment of support for a spouse or childâ€ are exceptions to the automatic stay. Rule 225(b)(6), SCACR.Â  \r\n[6] Although conditions of visitation and the grant of additional summer and holiday visitation may not appear to be the same matter being addressed on appeal, the decisions both of the Court of Appeals and of this Court in the first appeal were impacted by the suspension of overnight visitation in deciding whether to award Father additional summer and Easter visitation. The Court of Appeals noted that Father had not been exercising overnight visitation in its opinion, while the suspension of overnight visitation came before this Court at oral argument during the first appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of David Harold Hanna","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2007-01-18-01","description":"This is an order placing an attorney on interim suspension.","date":"2007-01-22","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of David Harold Hanna, Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel has filed a petition asking this Court to place respondent on interim suspension pursuant to Rule 17(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and seeking the appointment of an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â Â \r\n \r\nIT IS ORDERED that respondentâ€™s license to practice law in this state is suspended until further order of the Court.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Donna F.

No. 2004-UP-542 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 26, 2004).Â  We agree and reverse. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn the course of Claimantâ€™s employment with 3V, Inc. (Employer), she suffered successive accidental injuries to her back and leg.Â  Her first injury occurred on July 20, 1999.Â  Employerâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation insurance carrier at the time of this accident was EBI.Â  Claimant returned to work August 24, 1999.Â  She was placed on light duty for two months before she returned to full duty.Â Â  Claimant testified Dr. Wilkins released her from his care in January 2000, because she reached maximum medical improvement.\r\nClaimantâ€™s second injury occurred on May 11, 2000.Â  Employerâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation insurance carrier at the time of this injury was Liberty.Â  Claimant returned to work on May 23, 2000, and assumed light duty.Â  Employer sent Claimant home two days later because it did not have any more light duty work for her.Â  Claimant has not worked since that time and has not applied for any other jobs.Â  \r\nClaimant filed for workersâ€™ compensation benefits for the first injury.Â  Employer and EBI admitted Claimant sustained an injury, but denied benefits because she had reached maximum medical improvement.Â  Claimant then filed a second claim for benefits for the second injury.Â  EBI and Liberty denied benefits, maintaining Claimantâ€™s injuries were attributable to her first accident.Â  \r\nAt the hearing before the Single Commissioner, EBI argued: (1) Claimantâ€™s injuries from the first accident were no longer compensable because she had reached maximum medical improvement; (2) Dr. Wilkins released Claimant from his care in January 2000; and (3) Claimantâ€™s injuries from the second accident were not the same as her injuries from the first.Â  Liberty argued Claimant never reached maximum medical improvement and EBI should share liability with Liberty for Claimantâ€™s current injuries.Â  \r\nDr. Wilkins gave conflicting testimony regarding Claimantâ€™s medical condition.Â  Claimant had no appointments with Dr. Wilkins between her January 2000 visit and her May 2000 injury.Â  However, she did contact him to request prescriptions for pain medication.Â  At the time of the second accident, Claimant continued to experience back pain stemming from the first accident.Â  Although Claimant experienced the same symptoms as the first accident, she testified the symptoms were significantly worse following the second accident.Â  Â Â \r\nIn his deposition testimony, Dr. Wilkins testified Claimant reached maximum medical improvement in January 2000 when he released her from his care with no restriction on her activity.Â  However, Dr. Wilkinsâ€™ notes did not reflect a finding of maximum medical improvement.Â  He testified he did not see Claimant again until after her second accident when she complained of the same symptoms she experienced after the first accident.Â  \r\nAlso in his deposition testimony, Dr. Wilkins was asked which accident he believed caused Claimantâ€™s current condition and he responded, â€œ[T]he problem that she had from the first and from the second and today is all the same problem.Â  The, the ideology [sic] and cause of her pain is the sameâ€¦.Â  I would consider that the second injury, per say [sic], is, was actually just an aggravation of her initial injury.â€Â  When asked if Claimantâ€™s current condition â€œflow[ed] from the first accident,â€ Dr. Wilkins responded, â€œI would say yes â€¦ if she hadnâ€™t had the original injury â€¦ I would think itâ€™d be reasonable that she probably would not have had the second injury, which is actually aggravation.â€Â  \r\nWhen Dr. Wilkins testified before the Single Commissioner, he attributed Claimantâ€™s current condition to the second injury.Â  However, he consistently characterized the second accident as an aggravation of the first, and continually noted the symptoms and complaints were the same for both injuries.Â  Dr. Wilkins identified the first accident as the â€œproximate cause of the entire thing.â€\r\nThe Single Commissioner found both of Claimantâ€™s injuries compensable and found Dr. Wilkins had not released Claimant from his care or given his opinion as to maximum medical improvement based on Dr. Wilkinsâ€™ records.Â  The Single Commissioner found: \r\n\r\n[The second injury] was intervening, but not totally independent of the [first] accidental injury and that the [second] accidental injury aggravated, exacerbated, and worsened Claimantâ€™s condition; and the two injuries from the two accidental injuries are intertwined, indistinguishable, and inseparable beginning May 11, 2000 [the date of the second accident] and remain so as of the date of the hearing.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Single Commissioner ordered EBI to pay Claimantâ€™s benefits for the time period between the first and second accidents, and ordered EBI and Liberty to â€œshare equally in all causally related benefitsâ€ from the date of the second accident forward.Â  EBI appealed and the Full Commission affirmed. \r\nEBI appealed to the circuit court which reversed, finding the rule in Gordon v. E.I. Du Pont Nemours &amp; Co., controlled, 228 S.C. 67, 76, 88 S.E.2d 844, 848 (1955) (where a non-disabling injury is aggravated with resulting disability, such disability is compensable).Â  The circuit court found no evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that Dr. Wilkins had not released Claimant as having maximum medical improvement.Â  The circuit court also found the second accident was â€œclearly distinguishableâ€ from the first accident because Claimantâ€™s need for benefits after the second accident was necessitated solely by the second accident.Â  Consequently, Liberty was found to be solely liable for Claimantâ€™s entire benefits following the second accident.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the circuit court and reinstated the Commissionâ€™s decision.Â  The Court of Appeals rejected EBIâ€™s argument that Gordon controlled because it found substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s finding Claimantâ€™s injuries were â€œintertwined, indistinguishable, and inseparable.â€Â  Op. No. 2004-UP-542 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 26, 2004).Â  We granted Petitionerâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Does the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission have authority to apportion liability between EBI and Liberty for successive injuries to Claimant?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in failing to apply the Gordon v. E.I. Du Pont Nemours &amp; Co., 228 S.C. 67, 88 S.E.2d 844 (1955), rule to the facts of this case?Â \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppellate review of workersâ€™ compensation decisions is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442&nbsp;(2000); see also Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  The Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.Â  Id. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Act. No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006), a reviewing court determines whether the circuit court properly determined whether the full commissionâ€™s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the panelâ€™s decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Baxter v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43 (2006).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.â€Â  McCraw v. Mary Black Hosp., 350 S.C. 229, 235, 565 S.E.2d 286, 289&nbsp;(2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Authority to Apportion\r\nEBI argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding the Commission has the authority to apportion liability for Claimantâ€™s second injury and to order EBI to pay benefits related to the second injury when EBI did not provide coverage for Employer on the date of the second injury. We agree.\r\nA â€œsuccessive-carrier problemâ€ occurs when a worker suffers successive workplace injuries with an intervening change of employers or change of insurance carriers by the same employer.Â  9 Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 153.01[1] (2005).Â  There are two possible solutions to the successive-carrier problem.Â  \r\nThe apportionment solution has been adopted by many jurisdictions.[1]Â  The leading case establishing apportionment, Anderson v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., 175 N.E. 654, 655 (N.Y. 1931), explains the rationale for the approach:\r\n\r\nUnjust it is that the second insurer should bear the entire liability when the second accident was related in large measure to the first.Â  No less unjust it is that the first insurer should bear the entire liability if it appears that without the second accident an earlier recovery might have been had. \r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that it is complicated by statutes of limitations, out-of-state employers, and the difficulty of determining the proportion of liability attributable to each insurer.Â  9 Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law at Â§ 153.01[2].Â  South Carolina has neither statute nor case law authorizing the apportionment of workersâ€™ compensation benefits in successive injury cases.[2]Â  \r\nThe second solution to the successive-carrier problem is called the â€œlast injurious exposure ruleâ€ and it is the majority rule.[3]Â  Id. at Â§ 153.02[1].Â  This rule â€œplaces full liability upon the carrier covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury that bears a causal relation to the disability.â€Â  Id.Â  Consistent with the rule that an employer takes its employee as it finds her, the last injurious exposure rule makes the insurer at risk at the time of the second injury liable even if the second injury would have been much less severe in the absence of the prior condition and even if the prior injury significantly contributed to the final condition.Â  Id. at Â§ 153.02[2].Â  However, if the second injury is merely a recurrence of the first injury, then the insurer on the risk at the time of the original injury remains liable for the second.Â  Id. at Â§ 153.02[4].Â  The benefit of the last injurious exposure rule is it â€œprovides a reasonably equitable approach to compensation problems in the multi-employer context which is simple, easy to administer, and avoids the difficulties associated with apportionment.â€Â  82 Am.Jur.2d Workersâ€™ Compensation Â§ 200 (2003).Â  \r\nWhile South Carolina has not expressly adopted the last injurious exposure rule, both statutory and case law favor adopting the rule rather than the apportionment solution.Â  First, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-430 (1985) favors placing sole liability on a single insurer.Â  It states:\r\n\r\nWhenever a dispute arises between two or more parties as to which party is liable for the payment of workersâ€™ compensation benefits to an injured employee pursuant to the provisions of this title and there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the employeeâ€™s employment, his average weekly wage, the occurrence of an injury, the extent of the injury, and the fact that the injury arose out of and in the scope of the employment, the hearing commissioner may, in his discretion, require the disputing parties involved to pay benefits immediately to the employee and to share equally in the payment of those benefits until it is determined which party is solely liable, at which time the liable party must reimburse all other parties for the benefits they have paid to the employee â€¦.\r\n\r\nSecond, 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-409 (1976) instructs the Commission to presume the policy with the later effective date is in force â€œwhen duplicate or dual coverage exists by reason of two different insurance carriers issuing two policies to the same employer securing the same liability.â€Â  Finally, a number of cases have applied a version of the last injurious exposure rule and declined to follow the apportionment rule when dealing with occupational diseases.Â  See Glenn v. Columbia Silica Sand Co., 236 S.C. 13, 112 S.E.2d 711 (1960); Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 335 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1985); Hargrove, 360 S.C. 276, 599 S.E.2d 604.\r\nSince South Carolina has adopted neither the apportionment rule nor the last injurious exposure rule, this case presents a novel issue of law.Â  In the absence of authority permitting apportionment and because existing statutory authority expresses a preference for holding a single insurer liable rather than apportioning liability among multiple insurers, we adopt the last injurious exposure rule.Â  Applying this rule, we find the Court of Appeals erred in apportioning liability for Claimantâ€™s second injury.[4] Â \r\nII.Â  The Gordon Rule\r\nEBI argues the Court of Appeals erred in failing to apply the principle espoused in Gordon, that aggravation of a pre-existing condition is compensable.Â  In Gordon, this Court held:\r\n\r\nThe rule is well established that where a latent or quiescent weakened, but not disabling, condition resulting from disease is by accidental injury in the course and scope of employment aggravated or accelerated or activated, with resulting disability, such disability is compensable.Â  The same principle is equally applicable where the latent, but not disabling, condition has resulted from a prior accidental injury.Â  If the disability is proximately caused by the subsequent accidental injury, compensability is referable to that, and not the earlier one. \r\n\r\nId. at 76, 88 S.E.2d at 848 (internal citations omitted).Â  The Court of Appeals declined to follow Gordon because of the â€œfactual-driven nature of the Gordon decision.â€Â  On the contrary, the Gordon rule is â€œwell establishedâ€[5] and the Court of Appeals erred in limiting Gordon to its facts.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals distinguished Claimantâ€™s situation because her injuries were not separate and distinct but â€œintertwined, indistinguishable, and inseparable.â€Â  Gordon, according to the Court of Appeals, did not apply because it dealt with separate and distinct injuries.Â  The Court of Appeals was correct in determining the Commissionâ€™s finding of inseparability was supported by substantial evidence.Â  However, such a finding does not preclude the application of Gordon because Gordon is not limited to its particular facts.Â  Gordon applies to the instant case because: (1) Claimant suffered a non-disabling back injury during a workplace accident; (2) Claimantâ€™s disability was caused by the second accident; and (3) the second injury â€œaggravated or accelerated or activatedâ€ the pre-existing condition.Â  \r\nNot only does the Gordon rule apply to this case, but it also reflects the essence of the last injurious exposure rule which is to hold the insurer on the risk at the time of the second injury solely liable when the second injury aggravates the first injury.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the circuit court finding Liberty solely liable for Claimantâ€™s benefits following her second injury.Â  \r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See Employersâ€™ Cas.

Â§ 59-40-70(A).Â  \r\nAfter the Academy met with the Lee Board and the Advisory Committee on several occasions, the Advisory Committee voted to certify the application.Â  The Advisory Committee forwarded the Lee Board a certified application and notified the Lee Board of its decision in a letter.Â  At a public hearing, the Lee Board voted to deny the Academyâ€™s application.Â  In its Notice of Denial, the Lee Board stated that the application was not compliant with the requirements of the Charter Schools Act in at least seven areas.Â  The Lee Board also expressed its belief that approving the application would adversely impact other students in Lee County.Â  \r\nThe Academy appealed the decision of the Lee Board to the State Board arguing, among other things, that the Lee Boardâ€™s only concerns were financial in nature and that its bases for denial of the application were erroneous.Â  The State Board reversed the decision of the Lee Board and, in effect, granted a charter to the Academy.Â  The State Board found the order of the Lee Board lacked specificity because it did not base its findings of fact or conclusions of law on substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Although the State Board determined it could reverse on this basis alone, it also found the Academy met the statutory requirements in ten areas found deficient by the Lee Board.Â  \r\nThe Lee Board appealed the order of the State Board.Â  The Circuit Court affirmed.Â  We certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Did the circuit court err in finding no conflict existed between S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-70(A)(6) (2004), which requires all applications to be completed by the State Boardâ€™s published deadline, and 24 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 43-601(I)(C) (Supp. 2005), which permits the Advisory Committee to request and consider additional application materials after the deadline has passed?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the circuit court err in applying a more stringent notification requirement upon the Lee Board than set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-70(C) (2004)?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Did the circuit court err in affirming the State Boardâ€™s reversal of the Lee Board based solely on the contents of the Notice of Denial?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe circuit court reviews the order of the State Board under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005), which provides for reversal only if its findings are:\r\n\r\na)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\nb)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\nc)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made upon unlawful procedure;\r\nd)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affected by other error of law;\r\ne)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\nf)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nThis Court reviews the order of the circuit court to determine whether it properly applied the APA standard of review.Â  Beaufort County Bd. of Educ. v. Lighthouse Charter\r\nSch., 335 S.C. 230, 516 S.E.2d 655 (1999).Â  Although under the APA, the Court may not substitute its judgment for that of a state agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, it may reverse or modify decisions which are clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Welch Moving and Storage Co., Inc. v. Public Serv. Commâ€™n of South Carolina, 301 S.C. 259, 391 S.E.2d 556 (1990).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Conflict between Statute and Regulation\r\nThe Lee Board argues the circuit court erred in finding no\r\nconflict existed between S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-70(A)(6), which requires all applications to be completed by the State Boardâ€™s published deadline, and 24 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 43-601(I)(C), which permits the Advisory Committee to request and consider additional application materials after the deadline has passed.Â  The Lee Board failed to raise this argument to the State Board and, therefore, failed to preserve this issue for appellate review.Â  This Court has a limited scope of review and cannot consider issues that were not raised to and ruled on by the administrative agency.Â  Kiawah Resort Assoc. v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 502, 458 S.E.2d 542 (1995).Â \r\nHowever, in the interest of judicial economy, we conclude there is no conflict between S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-70(A)(6) and 24 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 43-601(I)(C).Â  Section 59-40-70(A)(6) instructs the Advisory Committee: â€œIf the [charter school] application is in noncompliance, it must be returned to the applicant with deficiencies noted.â€Â  We do not interpret this provision as mandatory. Â Regulation 43-601(I)(C) allows the Advisory Committee to â€œrequest clarification or additional information from the applicantâ€ and gives the Committee â€œthe authority to incorporate this additional information into the application.â€Â  The regulation is a proper and reasonable exercise of authority and, therefore, does not conflict with the statute.Â  \r\nII.Â  The Notification Requirement\r\nThe Lee Board argues the State Board erroneously applied a more stringent notification requirement upon the Lee Board than that provided in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-70(C), which requires local school boards to provide a written explanation of the reasons for denial with correlating statutory standards.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Lee Board failed to meet the statutory requirements set forth in Section 59-40-70(C) which states:\r\n\r\nA local school board of trustees shall only deny an application if the application does not meet the requirements specified in Section 59-40-50 or 59-40-60, fails to meet the spirit and intent of this chapter, or adversely affects, as defined in regulation, the other students in the district.Â  It shall provide, within 10 days, a written explanation of the reasons for denial, citing specific standards related to provisions of Section[s] 59-40-50 or 59-40-60 that the application violates.\r\n\r\nInstead of providing a â€œwritten explanation for the reasons for denial, citing specific standards,â€ the Lee Board spoke only in generalized terms in its Notice of Denial.Â  Section 59-40-70(C) clearly sets forth the requirements the Lee Board must follow, and the Lee Board failed to meet these requirements in its Notice of Denial.Â  The circuit court was, therefore, correct in affirming the State Boardâ€™s decision to reverse the Lee Board.\r\nIII.Â  The Notice of Denial\r\nThe Lee Board argues the State Board erroneously based its decision solely on the contents of the Lee Boardâ€™s Notice of Denial instead of the entire record, which purportedly contained evidence that supported the decision of the Lee Board to deny the charter school application.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe State Board properly based its decision on the Lee Boardâ€™s Notice of Denial.Â  Porter v. South Carolina Public Service Commission, 333 S.C. 12, 507 S.E.2d 328 (1998),[1] established the requirement for administrative agencies when presenting their findings:\r\n\r\nAn administrative body must make findings which are sufficiently detailed to enable this Court to determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether the law has been applied properly to those findings. Where material facts are in dispute, the administrative body must make specific, express findings of fact. An administrative agency is not required to present its findings of fact and reasoning in any particular format, although the better practice is to present them in an organized and regimented manner â€¦. We occasionally have upheld [administrative] orders which were conclusory in nature.Â  We did so in years past because no statute explicitly required an administrative agency to make specific findings of fact or state its reasoning as a predicate for judicial review - although we have long believed that is the better practice â€¦. [S]tatutes and our precedent require an administrative agency to make specific findings of fact and explain its rationale in sufficient detail to afford judicial review.Â  \r\n\r\nPorter, 333 S.C. at 21-22 n. 3, 507 S.E.2d at 332-333 n.3 (citations omitted). \r\nPorter also explained that courts will not sua sponte search the record for substantial evidence supporting a decision when an administrative agencyâ€™s order inadequately sets forth the agencyâ€™s findings of fact and reasoning.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Lee Boardâ€™s decision is embodied in its Notice of Denial.Â  Neither the State Board, the circuit court, nor this Court is obligated to search the entire record for information that should have been contained in the Notice of Denial.Â  Because the Lee Board failed to support its findings in the Notice of Denial with sufficient detail, the circuit court did not err in affirming the State Boardâ€™s reversal of the Lee Board.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Lee Board failed to provide the requisite specificity in its Notice of Denial and failed to comply with the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-70(C).Â  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision to affirm the State Boardâ€™s reversal of the Lee Board.Â  Our disposition of these issues makes it unnecessary to address the Lee Boardâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (an appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issues is dispositive).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and, as explained below, would vacate the circuit courtâ€™s order and remand the matter to that court for reconsideration.\r\nThe majority holds that â€œ[t]he circuit court reviews the order of the State Board under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA)â€¦.â€Â  I disagree,[2] and would hold that the charter school appeal process for cases such as this which commenced before July 1, 2000, lies entirely outside the APA.Â  In my opinion, the confusion that has resulted from the misapplication of the APA by the circuit court renders the order before us incapable of intelligent review such that a remand is required.\r\nIn 1996, the General Assembly enacted the â€œSouth Carolina Charter Schools Act of 1996 (the Act),â€ [3] codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 59-40-10 et seq.Â  Pursuant to the Act, if the local board denies an application â€œthe charter applicant may appeal the denial to the State Board of Education pursuant to Section 59-40-90.â€Â  This section establishes the procedure for these appeals, and allows the State Board to affirm or reverse the local boardâ€™s action.Â  Â§ 59-40-90(C).Â  Under the Act, the State Board acts as an appellate body in reviewing the local boardâ€™s decision.Â  The State Boardâ€™s scope of review and standard of review in this appellate process in found in 24 S.C. Regs. 43-600(1)(D) and (E).[4]\r\nUnder the version of the Act in effect at the time this case arose, the â€œfinal decision of the state board may be appealed by any party to the circuit court for the county in which the proposed charter school is or was to have located [sic].â€Â  Â§ 59-40-90(D).Â  This right to appeal to the circuit court exists pursuant to the Act, not the APA.Â  As an appeal outside the ambit of the APA, the circuit courtâ€™s jurisdiction is founded on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-10 (1985) and its scope of review is governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 18-7-170 through -190 (1985).Â  In my view, the conclusion that this appeal lies outside the APA is confirmed by 2006 Act No. 274.Â  This act, effective July 1, 2006, amends Â§ 59-40-90 to provide that charter school appeals from the state board are now made to the Administrative Law Court.\r\nThe circuit court reviewed this appeal under the APA rather than under the Title 18 standards.Â  As a result, this Court cannot perform its appellate function with any degree of certainty.Â  I would therefore vacate the circuit court order and remand for reconsideration under the Title 18 standard.Â  See Karl Sitte Plumbing Co., Inc. v. Darby Dev. Co. of Columbia, Inc., 295 S.C. 70, 367 S.E.2d 162 (Ct. App. 1988) (circuit court order applying wrong standard of review reversed and remanded for\r\nredetermination).\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Although Porter addresses the Public Service Commission, we find it applicable to all administrative agencies, including local school boards.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; I also disagree with Part III of the majorityâ€™s opinion which analyzes the sufficiency of the Lee Boardâ€™s Notice of Determination under an APA standard.Â  A local school board is not an agency within the meaning of the APA, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310(2) (2005): in my opinion, the expansion of this definition to include local institutions intrudes on the Legislatureâ€™s prerogative, and is unduly burdensome to those entities.\r\n[3]&nbsp; 1996 Act No. 447, Â§ 2, as amended by 2002 Act No. 341, Â§ 1.\r\n[4]&nbsp; Among other things, this regulation requires the State Board when acting in its appellate capacity under the Act to apply standards very similar to those used by a circuit court when reviewing an APA appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26256","title":"Cannon v.

S.C. Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole and Pardon Servs., 361 S.C. 425, 604 S.E.2d 709 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We reverse.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by finding petitioner was required to submit a DNA sample for inclusion in the Stateâ€™s DNA database as a condition of his parole?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner was convicted of murder in 1972, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.[2]Â  He subsequently pled guilty to two additional counts of murder and unlawfully carrying a pistol and received concurrent life sentences.Â  All three counts arose from the same event.\r\nAfter serving over eleven years on the concurrent life sentences, petitioner was paroled on October 12, 1983.Â  He was to remain on parole for the rest of his life.Â  The conditions of his supervised release did not call for submitting any type of sample, but he was required to â€œcarry out all instructions [his parole agent] gives.â€\r\nIn 1995, South Carolina enacted the Act, requiring a person â€œcurrently paroled and remaining under supervision of the Stateâ€ to provide a DNA sample as a condition of parole.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-620(C) (Supp. 1995).Â  The Act was subsequently amended in July 2000, to require a sample from someone â€œconvicted or adjudicated delinquent before July 1, 2000, who is serving a probated sentence or is paroled on or after July 1, 2000.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-620(E)(1) (Supp. 2000).[3]\r\nIn 2001, respondent informed petitioner he was required to provide a DNA sample as a condition of his parole and his failure to do so would constitute a parole violation.Â  Petitioner instituted this action, asking whether the Act requires him to submit a DNA sample.Â  Petitionerâ€™s motion for a temporary restraining order was granted and respondent was enjoined from requiring petitioner to provide a sample of his DNA pending the outcome of this action.\r\nThe statute at issue, Â§ 23-3-620(E)(1) (Supp. 2000), states:\r\n\r\n(E)&nbsp; At such time as possible and before release from confinement or release from the agencyâ€™s jurisdiction, a suitable sample from which DNA may be obtained for inclusion in the State DNA Database must be provided as a condition of probation or parole by:\r\n  \r\n(1) A person convicted . . . before July 1, 2000, who is serving a probated sentence or is paroled on or after July 1, 2000, for: [one or more enumerated crimes];[4] and\r\n(2) any criminal offender ordered by the court who was convicted . . . before July 1, 2000, and who is serving a probated sentence or is paroled on or after July 1, 2000.\r\n  \r\n\r\nPetitioner argued to the trial court that the word â€œparoledâ€ refers to an individual who is â€œreleased to paroleâ€ on or after July 1, 2000, and that because he was released to parole prior to that day, the Act does not apply to him. The court found that such a construction of the word â€œparoledâ€ would limit the statuteâ€™s operation and would be destructive of its intent.Â  The court found it was the intent of the legislature to include all individuals currently paroled in the database.Â  Therefore, the court held that petitioner must provide a sample as a condition of his parole. Â The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\n&nbsp;We find the Act is inapplicable to petitioner because the Legislatureâ€™s act of amending the statute in 2000 shows that a departure from the original law was intended. Â See Kerr v. State, 345 S.C. 183, 547 S.E.2d 494 (2001) (adoption of amendment which materially changes statuteâ€™s terminology raises presumption that departure from original law was intended).Â  It is presumed the Legislature, in adopting an amendment to a statute, intended to make some change in the existing law. Â Vernon v. Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., 244 S.C. 152, 135 S.E.2d 841 (1964). Â See also Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 574 S.E.2d 196 (2002) (it must be presumed the Legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather intended its statutes to accomplish something); Stuckey v. State Budget and Control Bd., 339 S.C. 397, 529 S.E.2d 706 (2000) (subsequent statutory amendment may be interpreted as clarifying original legislative intent).Â  Accordingly, as petitioner contends, we find the plain wording of the statute indicates the word â€œparoledâ€ refers to an individual who is â€œreleased to paroleâ€ on or after July 1, 2000.Â  See Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 420 S.E.2d 843 (1992) (words of a statute must be given their\r\nplain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation); Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 520, 377 S.E.2d 569 (1989) (cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate Legislatureâ€™s intent).\r\nOur disposition of this issue makes it unnecessary to address petitionerâ€™s ex post facto argument.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward W. Miller, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 23-3-600 through 700 (Supp. 2000).\r\n[2]State v. Cannon, 260 S.C. 537, 197 S.E.2d 678, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1067 (1973).\r\n[3]Since petitioner filed this action, the Act was amended again in 2004.Â  The only amendment to the phrase in question is a change in date, and the statute states a sample is a condition of parole for â€œa person convicted or adjudicated delinquent before July 1, 2004, who is serving a probated sentence or is paroled on or after July 1, 2004.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-620(E)(1) (Supp. 2005).\r\n[4]A person convicted of a violent crime is subject to the Act.Â  A violent crime is defined in S.C. Code Ann.
