Lee, III. In exchange for Appellant\r\npurchasing a $100,000 life insurance policy and naming the University the sole,\r\nirrevocable beneficiary of the policy, Appellant was given the \"opportunity to\r\n\npurchase tickets\" for his lifetime to University football and basketball games.\r\nYears later, the University instituted a program that required all Gamecock Club\r\nmembers, which included Appellant, to pay a seat license fee as a prerequisite for\r\npurchasing season tickets. Believing that the University could not require him to\r\npay additional consideration for the opportunity to purchase tickets without\r\nviolating the agreement, Appellant brought a declaratory judgment action. The\r\ntrial court entered judgment for the University and the Gamecock Club, finding\r\nthat Appellant was not deprived of the opportunity to purchase season tickets when\r\nthe University instituted the seat license fees. We reverse.\r\n\r\n                                           I.\r\n\r\nGeorge M. Lee, III, has been a member of the Gamecock Club for many years.\r\nPrior to 1990, Lee was a member at the Full Scholarship level, affording him the\r\nopportunity to purchase tickets to University home athletic events. In 1990, Lee\r\ntook advantage of an opportunity offered by the Gamecock Club in order to elevate\r\nhis membership to the Lifetime Full Scholarship level, which would ensure\r\npreferred seating assignments at basketball and football games were protected.1\r\nThe Gamecock Club presented Lee with two options: Lee could make a one-time\r\ndonation of $100,000 to the Gamecock Club or he could take out a life insurance\r\npolicy in the amount of $100,000 with the University as the sole, irrevocable\r\nbeneficiary. Lee chose the latter option.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 1990, Lee entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (Agreement)\r\nwith the Gamecock Club. The Agreement provided that Lee would \"irrevocably\r\nassign and contribute to the Gamecock Club the face amount of a whole life\r\ninsurance policy valued at a minimum $100,000 with an A+ top 25 company as\r\nrated by the 'Best Rating System.'\" The Agreement further provided that Lee\r\nwould pay the annual premiums on the policy \"of a sum not less than\r\n$1,000 . . . for a period of eight (8) years until the policy is paid up[,] at which time\r\nthe Gamecock Club will own the paid up policy.\" In exchange, Lee was\r\n\"designated as a Lifetime Scholarship Donor for the eight (8) years [he paid] on the\r\npolicy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Although it was under no obligation to do so, the Gamecock Club accommodated\r\nLee's request to take over his father's seats after his father's death in 1990.\r\n\nThe Agreement contained an attachment that listed the benefits Lee would\r\nreceive.2 The Agreement further stated that: \"In accordance with said attachment,\r\nGeorge M. Lee, III[,] will have the opportunity to purchase tickets entitled to the\r\nGamecock Level or membership presently held.\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eight-year period, the Gamecock Club notified Lee that, due to\r\n\"optimistic interest rate projections\" in 1990 that never materialized, the Gamecock\r\nClub had not \"realize[d] the needed cash value to insure the intended $100,000\r\nface value\" of the policy. Thus, the Gamecock Club offered Lee a new agreement\r\nwith three options: (1) make no further payments to the Gamecock Club and revert\r\nback to Full Scholarship level; (2) contribute $500 or more to the Gamecock Club\r\nin order to remain a Lifetime Full Scholarship member; or (3) \"[c]ontinue [paying]\r\nthe current premium until such time as the intended face value of the policy is\r\nrealized.\" Lee chose the second option and began paying $500 a year to maintain\r\nhis Lifetime Full Scholarship status and the accompanying benefits.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the University considered several revenue-enhancing alternatives,\r\nincluding raising ticket prices. Following the lead of other universities, the\r\nUniversity rejected the idea of raising ticket prices and decided to institute what it\r\ncalled the Yearly Equitable Seating (YES) program. The YES program required\r\nall Gamecock Club members, regardless of membership level, to pay a seat license\r\nfee each year for the opportunity to purchase tickets and maintain their current\r\nseats.3 To that end, Lee was required to pay $325 per year for each of his eight\r\nseats in order to maintain his seating at football games. Lee has paid this license\r\nfee under protest since the institution of the YES program.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Lee testified that one of the most attractive benefits of the Agreement was that,\r\nwhile a Lifetime Full Scholarship member, he had the right to designate an heir for\r\nhis tickets—an option not available to most Gamecock Club members. Lee was\r\nalso entitled to the following benefits under the Agreement: (1) four season\r\nfootball tickets in the \"best available\" location; (2) four additional season football\r\ntickets; (3) assigned reserved parking for football games; (4) second priority on\r\naway and bowl games; (5) four season basketball tickets in the \"best available\"\r\nlocation; (6) assigned parking at the Carolina Coliseum; and (7) second priority on\r\naway and tournament basketball tickets.\r\n3 The University presented the YES program as an advantage, for it asserted\r\nrequiring a seat license fee (as opposed to raising ticket prices) provided a tax\r\nbenefit to Gamecock Club members.\r\n\n                                         II.\r\n\r\nLee and Elizabeth Sims4 filed a declaratory judgment action to determine whether\r\nthey were entitled to purchase season tickets without paying the seat license fees.\r\nThe trial court, sitting non-jury, found that the Agreement was \"unambiguous on\r\nits face\" and further found that, even when required to pay the seat license fees,\r\nLee retained the \"opportunity to purchase tickets.\" As a result, the trial court held\r\nthat the University complied with the terms of the Agreement and that Lee was\r\nrequired to pay the seat license fees in order to retain the opportunity to purchase\r\nseason tickets to athletic events. Lee appealed, which we certified for review\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.          III.\r\n\r\n\"A suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by\r\nthe nature of the underlying issue.\" Felts v. Richland Cnty., 303 S.C. 354, 356,\r\n400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). \"An action for breach of contract is an action at law.\"\r\nElectro Lab of Aiken, Inc. v. Sharp Constr.

Because the construction of\r\na clear and unambiguous contract is a matter of law for the court, we review the\r\ntrial court's findings of law de novo. Watts v.

(quoting Blakeley v.

(quoting Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78,\r\n93, 594 S.E.2d 485, 493 (Ct. App. 2004)). Courts \"are without authority to alter an\r\nunambiguous contract by construction or to make new contracts for the parties. A\r\ncourt must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms regardless of its\r\nwisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or the parties' failure to guard their\r\nrights carefully.\" S.C. Dep't. of Transp. v. M & T Enters. of Mt. Pleasant, 379 S.C.\r\n645, 655, 667 S.E.2d 7, 13 (Ct. App. 2008) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nApplying these settled principles of contract interpretation, we agree with the trial\r\ncourt that the Agreement is unambiguous. However, we find legal error in the trial\r\ncourt's interpretation and conclude that the University breached the Agreement by\r\nrequiring Lee to pay the additional seat license fee to retain the opportunity to\r\npurchase tickets. The Agreement reflects the agreed upon bargain between Lee\r\nand the University.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Agreement is clear. As long as Lee performs his contractual\r\nobligations, the University must provide him with the \"opportunity to purchase\"\r\nseason tickets to University athletic events as described in the Agreement. The\r\nAgreement contains no limitations or conditions on this contractual right. Thus, by\r\nrequiring Lee to pay the seat license fee before purchasing season tickets, the\r\nUniversity has attempted to impose an additional term that the parties did not agree\r\nupon. This unilateral attempt to modify the Agreement is impermissible. See 17A\r\nAm. Jur. 2d Contracts § 507 (\"[O]ne party to a contract may not unilaterally alter\r\nits terms.\"). Indeed, \"[o]nce [a] bargain is formed, and the obligations set, a\r\ncontract may only be altered by mutual agreement and for further consideration.\"\r\nLayman v. State, 368 S.C. 631, 640, 630 S.E.2d 265, 269 (2006). We hold that the\r\nUniversity and the Gamecock Club are required by the terms of the Agreement to\r\npermit Lee the opportunity to purchase tickets without being subject to any other\r\nconditions, including the payment of seat license fees.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the need for the University to increase its revenue streams, and we\r\nappreciate that the YES program (as opposed to increasing ticket prices) is an\r\neffort to provide ticketholders with certain tax benefits. Indeed, the University\r\nwould be permitted under the Agreement to increase ticket prices. However, the\r\nclear and unambiguous language of the Agreement prohibits the University from\r\nimposing additional fees that Lee must pay before being allowed the opportunity to\r\npurchase tickets. Were we to accept the University's view of the Agreement, it\r\nwould mean Lee received little or nothing in the bargain, for the University would\r\n\nalways have the ability to demand additional consideration for the opportunity to\r\npurchase tickets. That is the very thing foreclosed by the Agreement.\r\n\r\n                                         V.\r\n\r\nWe conclude that the Agreement unambiguously prohibits the University from\r\nrequiring Lee to pay the seat license fee as a prerequisite for the opportunity to\r\npurchase tickets pursuant to the Agreement. We reverse the decision of the trial\r\ncourt and remand for entry of judgment for Lee.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting\r\nin a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent and would affirm the circuit\r\ncourt's ruling that Respondents did not breach the contract.\r\n\r\nI find that the trial court was correct in its construction of this contract. I agree with\r\nthe circuit court, and the majority, that this contract is unambiguous on its face.\r\nLooking to the plain language, it provides that Lee would be a \"Lifetime Full\r\nScholarship Member\" with \"the opportunity to purchase tickets.\" Lee has received\r\nexactly what he bargained for. He is both a Lifetime Full Scholarship member and\r\nthat he has the opportunity to purchase tickets just as any other person with this\r\nstatus. Accordingly, I agree with the circuit court that the University did not breach\r\nthe contract.\r\n\r\nAs the majority states, \"we are without the authority to alter an unambiguous\r\ncontract by construction.\" S.C. Dept. of Transp. v. M & T Enters. of Mt. Pleasant,\r\n379 S.C. 645, 655, 667 S.E.2d 7, 13 (Ct. App. 2008). Despite acknowledging this\r\nprinciple, the majority states that the language of this contract \"prohibits the\r\nUniversity from imposing additional fees.\" I am unable to find any language\r\nprohibiting additional fees. Further, the majority acknowledges that a court must\r\nenforce an unambiguous contract regardless of its wisdom, folly, apparent\r\nunreasonableness, or the parties' failure to guard their rights carefully. Id. Despite\r\nacknowledging this principle, the majority finds that under the circuit court's\r\nreading of the contract, Lee receives \"little or nothing in the bargain.\" I disagree\r\nwith the notion that Lee received nothing. As he concedes, he is a Lifetime\r\nScholarship Member, with all its attendant benefits, and he has opportunity to\r\npurchase tickets in the same manner as everyone else at that level.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I dissent and would affirm the circuit court's order finding that the\r\nUniversity did not breach this unambiguous contract.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27373","title":"Green v.

Mitchell\r\n            Brown, of Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough, LLP, of\r\n            Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This is an appeal from a circuit court order granting\r\nthe automobile insurance carrier (USAA) summary judgment in this action to\r\ndetermine coverage under a policy issued in Florida. Appellant Green,\r\nrepresenting his child who was injured while a passenger in his mother's\r\nautomobile, contends that as a matter of public policy the courts of South Carolina\r\nshould refuse to recognize the validity of a family member exclusion in the Florida\r\n\npolicy.1 Further, he contends that the circuit court erred in finding there was no\r\nuninsured motorist coverage for his minor child under his Florida policy.\r\nReluctantly, we agree with the circuit court that enforcement of this exclusion,\r\nwhich is admittedly valid under Florida law, does not offend our public policy, and\r\nthat there is no underinsured coverage for father's minor child under the father's\r\npolicy. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment to USAA.\r\n\r\n                                      FACTS\r\n\r\nAppellant owned two cars: a Blazer driven primarily by him, and a Honda driven\r\nby his wife (mother). Both cars were insured under a policy issued to appellant in\r\nFlorida. The Honda was registered in that state, but the Blazer was registered in\r\nSouth Carolina. Appellant maintains a Florida driver's license because \"He goes to\r\nFlorida on a regular basis . . . [t]o see his parents.\" Notwithstanding the Florida\r\nlicense, Florida registration, and Florida insurance policy, mother testified she and\r\nappellant had lived continuously in Beaufort since they married in 2004.2 The\r\naccident occurred in South Carolina when mother was making a left turn at an\r\nintersection and an oncoming car hit her Honda on the passenger's side, severely\r\ninjuring her minor child, Inman Green. Mother is the at-fault driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      ISSUES\r\n\r\n             1) Did the policy's family member exclusion violate South\r\n                Carolina's public policy?\r\n\r\n             2) Did the circuit court err in finding the injured child could not\r\n                recover under the Florida policy's underinsured (UIM)3\r\n                coverage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The validity of these types of exclusions is discussed in an A.L.R. annotation.\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin J. McMahon, Annotation, Validity, under Insurance Statutes, of coverage\r\nexclusion for injury to or death of insured's family or household members, 52\r\nA.L.R. 4th 18 (1987 and Supp. 2012). \n\r\n  No issue regarding appellant's compliance with the South Carolina Motor Vehicle \n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsibility Act is before us. \n\r\n  Under the policy here, underinsured coverage is a type of uninsured motorist \n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\ncoverage. \n\r\n\n                                   ANALYSIS \n\r\n\r\n1. Public Policy\r\n\r\nUSAA declined coverage citing this exclusion:\r\n\r\n             There is no coverage for [Bodily Injury] for which a covered\r\n             person becomes legally responsible to pay to a member of that\r\n             covered person's family residing in that covered person's\r\n             household.\r\n\r\nIt is uncontroverted that mother was a covered person under the policy, and that the\r\ninjured child resides in mother's household. Further, it is undisputed that this\r\nfamily member exclusion is valid under Florida statutory law, and that the\r\nexclusion does not violate Florida's public policy. E.g., Mitchell v. State Farm\r\nMut. Auto. Ins., 678 So.2d 418 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996).\r\n\r\nThe circuit court cited the general rule, followed in South Carolina, that the\r\nvalidity of a contract is determined by the law of the state in which the contract\r\nwas made. E.g., Unison Ins. Co. v. Hertz Rental Corp., 312 S.C. 549, 436 S.E.2d\r\n182 (Ct. App. 1993). As noted above, it is uncontested that the exclusion is valid\r\nunder Florida law. Mitchell, supra.\r\n\r\nAppellant first argues that, because South Carolina has abolished parental\r\nimmunity, enforcement of the family member exclusion violates public policy.\r\nAppellant has conflated two separate ideas in making this argument. It is true, as\r\nhe argues, that South Carolina has abolished parental tort immunity. Elam v. Elam,\r\n275 S.C. 132, 268 S.E.2d 109 (1980). At issue here, however, is not the question\r\nof a common law immunity from suit but rather the enforceability of a contract\r\nprovision. Appellant's injured child may sue his mother in South Carolina for his\r\ninjuries, but the insurance policy does not provide coverage for her. The abolition\r\nof parental immunity in this State does not create a public policy bar to\r\nenforcement of the valid family member exclusion in USAA's Florida automobile\r\ninsurance policy.\r\n\r\nAppellant next contends that this action, arising out of mother's negligence, is\r\ngoverned by the doctrine of lex loci delecti, and thus the substantive law of South\r\nCarolina applies. As the circuit court held, the fact that the accident occurred in\r\nSouth Carolina does not convert the validity of the Florida contract from one of lex\r\n\nloci contractu into one of lex loci delecti. Unison, supra. The substantive law of\r\nFlorida governs the validity of the insurance contract's terms.\r\n\r\nFinally, Green relies on South Carolina cases refusing to apply out-of-state\r\nintrafamily immunities as a matter of public policy. See Algie v. Algie, 261 S.C.\r\n103, 198 S.E.2d 529 (1973) (refusing to dismiss suit based upon Florida\r\ninterspousal immunity doctrine); Boone v. Boone, 345 S.C. 8, 546 S.E.2d 191\r\n(2001) (refusing to apply Georgia interspousal immunity doctrine). Green has\r\nagain conflated South Carolina's public policy refusing to enforce other\r\njurisdictions' common law tort immunities in our courts with our construction of an\r\nout-of-state automobile insurance contract exclusion. Florida's District Court of\r\nAppeals made an eloquent argument for a change in Florida's policy regarding the\r\nvalidity of the family member exclusion in Mitchell, supra.4 Nevertheless, the\r\nFlorida court concluded as do we, that such a change is the prerogative of the\r\nFlorida legislature.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that the family member exclusion contained in the\r\nFlorida automobile policy at issue here, being valid under both Florida statutory\r\nauthority and Florida public policy considerations, is not void as against our public\r\npolicy when applied in this South Carolina litigation.\r\n\r\n2. UIM Coverage\r\n\r\nAppellant also sought to recover UIM benefits under the USAA policy, contending\r\nthat because the child's injuries exceeded the amount available under the liability\r\nprovision of the contract, UIM coverage was activated. The circuit court granted\r\nUSAA summary judgment on this UIM claim, holding that the policy's definition\r\n\r\n      Who else but a spouse or family member is most likely to be riding\r\n4     as a passenger in a Florida resident's car? Yet, injury to that family\r\n      member is excluded from liability coverage by most, if not all,\r\n      insurance policies issued in Florida. As counsel for State Farm\r\n      candidly admitted to us at oral argument, they knew of no insurance\r\n      policy offered in Florida without a family member exclusion. Not\r\n      only is the driver left without liability protection, but the very persons\r\n      whom the insureds most likely would want to have covered, may also\r\n      have no protection under the uninsured motorist coverage\r\n      section if there is only one policy involved.\r\nMitchell, 678 So.2d at 420 (footnote omitted).\r\n\nof an uninsured motor vehicle barred coverage. The policy's definition of\r\n\"uninsured\" explicitly excludes an automobile owned by or furnished to or\r\navailable for the regular use of the named insured or a family member. The\r\nevidence in the record was that the Honda involved in the accident was owned by\r\nmother and appellant, and that mother, a family member, regularly drove that\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Green argues that because the UIM coverage provision is both vague\r\nand void, he is entitled to coverage.

The circuit\r\ncourt granted summary judgment to the State, finding: (1) the Tribe's action was\r\nprecluded by collateral estoppel and/or res judicata, and (2) the Gambling Cruise\r\nAct does not confer upon the Tribe the right to offer video poker and similar\r\nelectronic play devices on its Reservation as the Act does not alter the statewide\r\nban on video poker. The Tribe appealed, and this Court certified the case for\r\nreview pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\n                                     I. FACTS\r\n\r\n       Because the Tribe's litigation has a long and complex history, we begin with\r\n(1) a brief historical background, (2) a review of events leading to a 1993\r\nSettlement Agreement, (3) a discussion of the Tribe's 2005 declaratory judgment\r\naction and this Court's opinion thereon in 2007, (4) an outline of the events\r\nculminating in the enactment of the Gambling Cruise Act of 2005, and (5) an\r\nexamination of the 2012 declaratory judgment action that is now before this Court.\r\n\r\n                            (1) Historical Background\r\n      In the 1760 Treaty of Pine Hill, as confirmed by the 1763 Treaty of Augusta,\r\nthe King of England and the Catawba Head Men and Warriors entered into an\r\nagreement in which the Catawba surrendered certain aboriginal territory in North\r\nCarolina and South Carolina to Great Britain in return for the right to settle on land\r\nlocated in South Carolina described as a \"Tract of Land of Fifteen Miles square,\"\r\ncomprised of 144,000 acres or 225 square miles. South Carolina v. Catawba\r\nIndian Tribe, Inc., 476 U.S. 498, 499-500 (1986); see also 25 U.S.C.A. § 941a(1)\r\n(2013) (describing treaties).\r\n\r\n       By 1840, the Catawba had leased most of this land to others. South\r\nCarolina, 476 U.S. at 501. In 1840, the Catawba entered into the Treaty of Nation\r\nFord, in which the Catawba conveyed its interest in this tract of land to the State in\r\nexchange for the establishment of a new reservation and scheduled monetary\r\npayments. Id. In 1842, the State purchased a 630-acre tract as a new reservation\r\n\nfor the Tribe, which then had a membership of about 450 persons, and the State\r\nheld the land in trust for the Tribe. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Catawba subsequently maintained that the State did not perform all of\r\nits obligations under the agreement and, further, that the State did not have the\r\nauthority to enter into the 1840 treaty based on federal provisions that prohibited\r\nthe conveyance of tribal land without the consent of the United States. Id.\r\n\r\n       State officials and the Federal Government became involved in the situation,\r\nand in 1943, the Tribe, the State, and the Office of Indian Affairs of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior entered into a Memorandum of Understanding, by\r\nwhich the State purchased 3,434 acres of land and conveyed it to the United States\r\nto be held in trust for the Tribe; the State and the Federal Government agreed to\r\nmake certain contributions to the Tribe; and the Tribe agreed to conduct its affairs\r\nbased on the Federal Government's recommendations, but was not required to\r\nrelease its claims against the State. Id. at 501-02.\r\n\r\n       During the ensuing years, Congress maintained some oversight of Indian\r\naffairs, but by 1953, it decided to make a change in its basic policy and to\r\nterminate its supervisory responsibilities for Indian tribes, marking the beginning\r\nof a \"termination era\" that lasted until the 1960s.1 Id. at 503. During this time,\r\nafter consultation with the Catawba, it was decided that an end to federal control\r\nwas desired by all parties. Id. at 503-04.\r\n\r\n       In 1959 Congress enacted the Catawba Indian Tribe Division of Assets Act\r\n(\"CITDA Act\"), 25 U.S.C.A. §§ 931–938, which distributed to the enrolled\r\nmembers of the Tribe the 3,434-acre reservation acquired in 1943. Id. at 504.\r\nAmong other things, the CITDA Act provided \"that state laws shall apply to\r\nmembers of the Tribe in the same manner that they apply to non-Indians.\" Id.\r\n(citing § 935 of the CITDA Act).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Between 1954 and 1962, Congress actually passed twelve separate \"Termination\r\nActs,\" the eleventh of which is the \"Catawba Act.\" Id. at 504 n.11. Section 5 of\r\nthe Catawba Act provides that \"the laws of the several States shall apply to [the\r\nCatawba] in the same manner they apply to other persons or citizens within their\r\njurisdiction.\" Id. at 505.\r\n\n                (2) Events Resulting in 1993 Settlement Agreement\r\n\r\n       In 1980, the Catawba brought an action seeking possession of the 225-\r\nsquare-mile tract of land in South Carolina and trespass damages for the period of\r\nits dispossession. Id. at 505. By that time, some 27,000 persons claimed title to\r\ndifferent parcels within the tract. Id. at 499. The United States Supreme Court\r\nissued an opinion in 1986 finding the statute of limitations applied to the Tribe's\r\nclaim, but it did not reach the question whether it barred the claim. Id. at 499-500.\r\n\r\n       In 1993, after many years of litigation and extensive negotiations, the\r\nCatawba, the State, and the United States entered into a settlement that ended the\r\ndispute over the right to possession of the 144,000 acres of land located in York,\r\nLancaster, and Chester counties. Catawba Indian Tribe of S.C. v. State, 372 S.C.\r\n519, 522, 642 S.E.2d 751, 752 (2007). This 1993 Settlement Agreement has been\r\ncodified in both federal legislation2 and state legislation (the \"State Act\")3 that\r\nimplements the agreement. Id. at 522-23, 642 S.E.2d at 752-53. The federal\r\nlegislation requires the Settlement Agreement and the State Act to be complied\r\nwith as if they had been implemented by federal law. Id. at 523, 642 S.E.2d at 753\r\n(citing 25 U.S.C.A. § 941b(a)(2) (2001)).\r\n\r\n      Under the terms of the settlement, the Catawba waived its right to be\r\ngoverned by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"IGRA\").4 Id.; see 25 U.S.C.A.\r\n§ 941l(a) (2013) (\"The [IGRA] shall not apply to the Tribe.\"). Instead, the\r\nCatawba agreed to be governed by the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the\r\nState Act as pertains to games of chance. Catawba Indian Tribe, 372 S.C. at 523,\r\n642 S.E.2d at 753.\r\n\r\n       As is relevant here, the State Act and the Settlement Agreement both\r\nprovide: \"The Tribe may permit on its Reservation video poker or similar\r\nelectronic play devices to the same extent that the devices are authorized by state\r\nlaw.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 27-16-110(G) (2007); Settlement Agreement § 16.8. At\r\n\r\n2   25 U.S.C.A. §§ 941 to 941n (2013) (federal codification of settlement).\r\n3   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 27-16-10 to -140 (2007) (State Act).\r\n4   25 U.S.C.A. §§ 2701–2721 (2013) (IGRA).\r\n\nthe time the Settlement Agreement was executed in 1993, video poker was legal in\r\nSouth Carolina. Thereafter, in 1999, the South Carolina General Assembly passed\r\na statewide ban on the possession and operation of video poker devices. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 12-21-2710 (2000); Act No. 125, 1999 S.C. Acts 1319 (effective July 1,\r\n2000).           (3) First Declaratory Judgment Action in 2005\r\n      In 2005, the Tribe brought a declaratory judgment action against the State\r\nand the Attorney General seeking, inter alia, a declaration that, despite the\r\nenactment of the statewide ban in section 12-21-2710, it had a present and\r\ncontinuing right to utilize video poker or similar electronic play devices on its\r\nReservation. Catawba Indian Tribe, 372 S.C. at 523, 642 S.E.2d at 753. The\r\nTribe contended the terms of the Settlement Agreement (§ 16.8) and the State Act\r\n(S.C. Code Ann. § 27-16-110(G)) authorized video poker to the same extent\r\nallowed by state law, and video poker was legal at the time the parties executed the\r\nSettlement Agreement. Id.\r\n\r\n       In 2007, this Court issued its opinion holding the Tribe's right to video poker\r\nunder the Settlement Agreement is subject to future changes in state law, as\r\ncontemplated in the language of the cited provisions. Id. at 529 n.8, 642 S.E.2d at\r\n592 n.8. Using the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms, the Court determined\r\nthe legislative intent was for the Tribe to be allowed to have video poker on its\r\nReservation \"to the same extent state law authorizes the devices,\" and we\r\nspecifically found \"[t]he language of § 27-16-110(G) is unambiguous.\" Id. at 525-\r\n26, 642 S.E.2d at 754-55. The Court concluded the Tribe could no longer permit\r\nvideo poker on its Reservation because the possession and operation of video\r\npoker devices was presently banned by section 12-21-2710. Id. at 527 n.7 & 530,\r\n642 S.E.2d at 755 n.7 & 757.\r\n\r\n        (4) Events Culminating in S.C.'s Gambling Cruise Act of 2005\r\n       The Tribe has now brought a second declaratory judgment action that\r\ninvolves interpretation of the Gambling Cruise Act. This legislation was enacted\r\napproximately two months before the Tribe's first declaratory action was initiated\r\nin 2005, but no question was raised regarding the Gambling Cruise Act in that first\r\naction. An overview of the events culminating in the passage of this legislation\r\nwill be helpful before considering the Tribe's current declaratory judgment action.\r\n\n       In 1951, Congress enacted what has become known as the Johnson Act, now\r\nfound at 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1171 to 1178, to prohibit the use and possession of\r\ngambling devices in interstate and foreign commerce, as well as in specified\r\njurisdictions. Brizill v. Dist. of Columbia Bd. of Elections & Ethics, 911 A.2d\r\n1212, 1214 (D.C. 2006). Until 1992, federal law prohibited gambling on any ship\r\noperating under the United States flag. Stardancer Casino, Inc. v. Stewart, 347\r\nS.C. 377, 380, 556 S.E.2d 357, 358 (2001) (citing the Gambling Ship Act, 18\r\nU.S.C.A. §§ 1081–1084, and the Johnson Act, 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1171–1178).\r\n\r\n        United States flag ships were placed at a competitive disadvantage because\r\nvessels under foreign flags were not prevented from offering gambling once the\r\nship was beyond state territorial waters. Id. In response to this situation, in 1992\r\nCongress amended § 1175 of the Johnson Act. Id. The Johnson Act still generally\r\nprohibits the use or possession of gambling devices on United States flag ships in\r\n§ 1175(a), but under an exception in § 1175(b), the possession or transport of a\r\ngambling device within state territorial waters is not a violation of this prohibition\r\nif the device remains on board the vessel and is used only outside those territorial\r\nwaters. Palmetto Princess, L.L.C. v. Georgetown County, 369 S.C. 34, 37, 631\r\nS.E.2d 68, 70 (2006). The exception does not apply, however, if a state in which\r\nthe voyage begins and ends has enacted a statute prohibiting gambling day cruises.\r\nId. at 37-38, 631 S.E.2d at 70 (citing 15 U.S.C.A. § 1175(b)(2)(A)). \"Thus, 'day\r\ncruises' . . . may be subject to federal criminal prosecution under § 1175(a) if they\r\nbegin and end in a state that 'has enacted a statute the terms of which prohibit that\r\nuse . . . .' \" Stardancer, 347 S.C. at 380, 556 S.E.2d at 358-59 (citing\r\n§ 1175(b)(2)(A)).\r\n\r\n       When the General Assembly amended section 12-21-2710 in 1999 to ban the\r\npossession and operation of video poker devices, it included an intent clause that\r\nstates in part: \"The General Assembly by enactment of this act has no intent to\r\nenact any provision allowed by 15 U.S.C. § 1175, commonly referred to as the\r\nJohnson Act, or to create any state enactment authorized by the Johnson Act.\" Id.\r\nat 385 & n.12, 556 S.E.2d at 361 & n.12 (citing § 22(B) of 1999 Act No. 125).\r\n\r\n        Since the State did not \"opt out\" of the Johnson Act, gambling day cruises,\r\ni.e., \"cruises to nowhere\" that went outside the state's territorial waters for\r\ngambling, were legal under federal law. Because of this, coastal counties and\r\nmunicipalities began adopting local ordinances banning gambling day cruises that\r\nleft from within their boundaries. However, this Court held in a series of decisions\r\nthat local governments did not possess the authority to ban such cruises because\r\n\nthe plain language of the Johnson Act indicated that only a state, not a political\r\nsubdivision of a state, could prohibit those cruises, and our General Assembly had\r\nelected not to enact a statute prohibiting the \"cruises to nowhere.\" See, e.g.,\r\nPalmetto Princess, L.L.C. v. Town of Edisto Beach, 369 S.C. 50, 631 S.E.2d 76\r\n(2006); Palmetto Princess, L.L.C. v. Georgetown County, 369 S.C. 34, 631 S.E.2d\r\n68 (2006).\r\n\r\n       To resolve this impasse, in 2005 the General Assembly enacted the\r\nGambling Cruise Act. S.C. Code Ann. §§ 3-11-100 to -500 (Supp. 2013). With\r\ncertain exceptions, the General Assembly delegated to municipalities and counties\r\n\"the authority conferred to this State by the United States Congress pursuant to the\r\nJohnson Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Sections 1171 through 1177[,] . . . to regulate\r\nor prohibit gambling aboard gambling vessels while such vessels are outside the\r\nterritorial waters of the State, when such vessels embark or disembark passengers\r\nwithin their respective jurisdictions for voyages that depart from the territorial\r\nwaters of the State, sail into United States or international waters, and return to the\r\nterritorial waters of the State without an intervening stop.\" Id. § 3-11-200(A); see\r\nalso id. § 3-11-300(B).\r\n\r\n      The Gambling Cruise Act explicitly states in pertinent part that it \"must not\r\nbe construed to . . . repeal or modify any other provision of law relating to\r\ngambling\" or to \"allow or permit gambling aboard any vessel, gambling vessel, or\r\npassenger cruise liner within the territorial waters of the State[.]\" Id. § 3-11-\r\n400(B)(1), (3) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n            (5) Current Declaratory Judgment Action Filed in 2012\r\n        On January 24, 2012, the Tribe filed the current declaratory judgment action\r\nin Richland County against the State seeking a declaration as to its rights under the\r\nSettlement Agreement and the State Act based on the enactment of the Gambling\r\nCruise Act. Specifically, the Tribe contended the Gambling Cruise Act constituted\r\nan \"authorization\" of video poker, and if video poker is permitted anywhere in the\r\nstate, the Tribe should be allowed to exercise the same right upon its Reservation.\r\nThe State argued this Court's 2007 Catawba opinion was dispositive because it\r\ndetermined the Tribe did not have the right to offer video poker on its Reservation\r\nas the use or possession of video poker devices was banned statewide. The State\r\ncontended the Tribe's action was precluded by collateral estoppel and res judicata,\r\nand that its assertions regarding the Gambling Cruise Act failed as a matter of law.\r\n\n       The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The circuit court\r\ngranted summary judgment to the State. The circuit court found the Tribe's action\r\nwas precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel and/or the doctrine of res\r\njudicata. In addition, the circuit court found the Gambling Cruise Act was not an\r\nauthorization of video poker and it did not alter the statewide ban on video poker,\r\nwhich remained in force. Thus, section 16.8 of the Settlement Agreement and the\r\nState Act did not require the State to allow the Tribe to offer video poker on its\r\nReservation. The Tribe appealed to the Court of Appeals. This Court certified the\r\ncase for its review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                         II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n        Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure states a motion\r\nfor summary judgment shall be granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\r\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" In determining whether any triable\r\nissues of fact exist, the trial court must view the evidence and all reasonable\r\ninferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party\r\nopposing summary judgment. Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534\r\nS.E.2d 688 (2000). \"An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment\r\nunder the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.\"\r\nId. at 379, 534 S.E.2d at 692.\r\n\r\n       Each side in this dispute asserts the case involves a legal question, i.e., an\r\nanalysis of the Gambling Cruise Act and a determination of its impact on the\r\nTribe's Settlement Agreement. \"Determining the proper interpretation of a statute\r\nis a question of law, and this Court reviews questions of law de novo.\" Town of\r\nSummerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008).\r\n\r\n                              III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.    Preclusion of Declaratory Judgment Action\r\n\r\n     The Tribe first contends the circuit court erred in finding its declaratory\r\njudgment action is precluded by collateral estoppel and/or res judicata. We agree.\r\n\r\n       \"Collateral estoppel occurs when a party in a second action seeks to preclude\r\na party from relitigating an issue which was decided in a previous action.\" S.C.\r\nProp. & Cas. Ins. Guaranty Ass'n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 304 S.C. 210, 213, 403\r\n\nS.E.2d 625, 627 (1991). In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., this Court adopted the general\r\nrule set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27 (1982). Id. \"Section\r\n27 provides that when an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined\r\nby a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment,\r\nthe determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether\r\non the same or a different claim.\" Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Stated another way, \"[t]he party asserting collateral estoppel must\r\ndemonstrate that the issue in the present lawsuit was: (1) actually litigated in the\r\nprior action; (2) directly determined in the prior action; and (3) necessary to\r\nsupport the prior judgment.\" Carolina Renewal, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385\r\nS.C. 550, 554, 684 S.E.2d 779, 782 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\n       The doctrine of collateral estoppel is also known as \"issue preclusion.\" In re\r\nCrews, 389 S.C. 322, 698 S.E.2d 785 (2010); Zurcher v. Bilton, 379 S.C. 132, 666\r\nS.E.2d 224 (2008); Shelton v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., 325 S.C. 248, 481 S.E.2d\r\n706 (1997). Issue preclusion bars the relitigation of only the particular issues that\r\nwere actually litigated and decided in the prior suit. Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v.\r\nPotter, 328 S.C. 201, 493 S.E.2d 826 (1997). As a result, the doctrine of collateral\r\nestoppel is inapplicable when the argument turns on an assertion that the other\r\nparty should have litigated a particular issue in the prior action. See id. at 216, 493\r\nS.E.2d at 835.\r\n\r\n        The doctrine of res judicata is a distinguishable concept. Beall v. Doe, 281\r\nS.C. 363, 369 n.1, 315 S.E.2d 186, 190 n.1 (Ct. App. 1984). Res judicata\r\nencompasses both issue preclusion and claim preclusion. Crestwood Golf Club,\r\nInc., 328 S.C. at 216, 493 S.E.2d at 834. However, res judicata is more commonly\r\nreferred to simply as claim preclusion. Garris v. Governing Bd. of S.C.\r\nReinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 449, 511 S.E.2d 48, 57 (1998). Claim\r\npreclusion bars plaintiffs from pursuing a later suit where the claim (1) was\r\nlitigated or (2) could have been litigated. Crestwood Golf Club, Inc., 328 S.C. at\r\n216, 493 S.E.2d at 835.\r\n\r\n      Our Court has recently reaffirmed the following statement of the doctrine:\r\n\r\n             Res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when\r\n      the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the\r\n      subject of a prior action between those parties. Under the doctrine of\r\n      res judicata, \"[a] litigant is barred from raising any issues which were\r\n\n      adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which might have been\r\n      raised in the former suit.\"\r\n\r\nPlum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109\r\n(1999) (alteration in original) (citations omitted), cited with approval in Judy v.\r\nJudy, 393 S.C. 160, 172, 712 S.E.2d 408, 414 (2011).\r\n\r\n       Res judicata may be applied if (1) the identities of the parties are the same as\r\nin the prior litigation, (2) the subject matter is the same as in the prior litigation,\r\nand (3) there was a prior adjudication of the issue by a court of competent\r\njurisdiction. Johnson v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 317 S.C. 248, 250-51, 452 S.E.2d\r\n832, 833 (1994). The doctrine of res judicata is not an \"ironclad bar,\" however, to\r\na later lawsuit. Judy, 393 S.C. at 167, 712 S.E.2d at 412; Garris, 333 S.C. at 449,\r\n511 S.E.2d at 57; Clark v. Aiken Cnty. Gov't, 366 S.C. 102, 109, 620 S.E.2d 99,\r\n102 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\n       The circuit court noted that the Tribe's first declaratory judgment action was\r\nbrought on July 28, 2005, almost two months after the Gambling Cruise Act took\r\neffect on June 1, 2005. The court found the Tribe relied upon section 27-16-\r\n110(G) in that action and had asked for a determination of its rights, under the\r\nSettlement Agreement and the State Act, to operate video poker or similar\r\nelectronic play devices on its Reservation. The court acknowledged that the Tribe\r\n\"made a somewhat different legal argument in the first action than now, contending\r\nthat the Settlement Agreement and § 27-16-110(G) could not be 'amended' by the\r\nGeneral Assembly based upon any future ban placed upon video poker.\" However,\r\nthe circuit court stated that in the first declaratory judgment action in 2005, \"the\r\nTribe also had the opportunity to make the same legal arguments it is now\r\npresenting. In such circumstances, res judicata or collateral estoppel bars the\r\nsecond suit.\"\r\n\r\n       As an initial matter, we note the circuit court's full ruling discusses the law\r\npertaining to res judicata, but it does not appear to delineate or distinguish the\r\nelements of collateral estoppel. Moreover, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is\r\ninapplicable when the argument turns on an assertion that the other party should\r\nhave litigated a particular issue in the prior action. Crestwood Golf Club, Inc., 328\r\nS.C. at 216, 493 S.E.2d at 835.\r\n\r\n      We find collateral estoppel is not applicable because the issue decided in the\r\n2005 declaratory judgment action is not the same as the issue asserted in the\r\n\ncurrent action. In the prior case, the Tribe sought a declaration that any changes in\r\nstate law did not affect its vested right to offer video poker on its Reservation\r\nbased on the terms of the Settlement Agreement (section 16.8) and the State Act\r\n(section 27-16-110(G)). In particular, the Tribe maintained the ban on video poker\r\nin section 12-21-2710 did not apply to it because the ban was enacted after the\r\nSettlement Agreement. In the 2007 Catawba opinion, this Court found that the\r\nlanguage of the Settlement Agreement and the associated statute that authorized\r\nthe Tribe to offer video poker \"to the same extent\" it is allowed by South Carolina\r\nlaw was intended to make the Tribe subject to the same law as all South Carolina\r\ncitizens, and this necessarily contemplated any changes in the law would apply to\r\nthe Tribe. Thus, the ban in section 12-21-2710 was equally applicable to the Tribe.\r\n\r\n       In contrast, in the current action the Tribe does not dispute that changes in\r\nstate law are applicable to the Tribe's agreement. The Tribe now contends that\r\nenactment of the Gambling Cruise Act amounts to an \"authorization\" of video\r\npoker in South Carolina; therefore, under the terms of its Settlement Agreement\r\nand the State Act, it should be allowed to offer video poker \"to the same extent\" on\r\nits Reservation. The Tribe is seeking a declaratory judgment as to the\r\ninterpretation and import specifically of the Gambling Cruise Act on its gaming\r\nrights. This is a distinguishable issue. The Gambling Cruise Act was never raised\r\nby the parties or addressed by any court in the first action and, contrary to the\r\nState's argument in brief, a review of the Act was not necessary to a determination\r\nof the question there. Since the current issue was not actually litigated in the prior\r\naction, the State has not met its burden of demonstrating that collateral estoppel\r\nshould be applied.\r\n\r\n       As to res judicata, we also find it is not preclusive here. Although res\r\njudicata normally applies to issues that were previously raised or that could have\r\nbeen raised in the prior action, declaratory judgments are distinguishable. As one\r\nlegal treatise has observed, res judicata does apply to declaratory judgments, but\r\nonly as to issues actually decided by the court:\r\n\r\n             Suits for declaratory judgments do not fall within the rule that a\r\n      former judgment is conclusive not only of all matters actually\r\n      adjudicated thereby but, in addition, also of all matters which could\r\n      have been presented for adjudication. A declaratory judgment is not\r\n      res judicata as to matters not at issue and not passed upon. Unlike\r\n      other judgments, a declaratory judgment determines only what it\r\n\n      actually decides and does not preclude, under res judicata principles,\r\n      other claims that might have been advanced.\r\n\r\n22A Am. Jur. 2d Declaratory Judgments § 244 (2013) (emphasis added) (footnotes\r\nomitted); see also 50 C.J.S. Judgments § 944 (2009) (\"[A] declaratory action\r\ndetermines only what it actually decides and does not have a claim preclusive\r\neffect on other contentions that might have been advanced.\"); Restatement\r\n(Second) of Judgments § 33 (1982) (\"A valid and final judgment in an action\r\nbrought to declare rights or other legal relations of the parties is conclusive in a\r\nsubsequent action between them as to the matters declared, and, in accordance\r\nwith the rules of issue preclusion, as to any issues actually litigated by them and\r\ndetermined in the action.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       Citing Robison v. Asbill, 328 S.C. 450, 492 S.E.2d 400 (Ct. App. 1997), the\r\ncircuit court appears to have found this concept applies only when a party is\r\nseeking additional, coercive relief following a successful ruling in a declaratory\r\njudgment action. However, this reading imposes an additional restriction that is\r\nnot articulated in the case law or the legal treatises. The success or failure of the\r\nTribe's prior action is not determinative as to whether res judicata is appropriate.\r\nThe Restatement makes clear that a declaratory judgment decides only what it\r\nactually decides, and the fact that the plaintiff lost a prior action does not vitiate\r\nthis principle. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 33 cmt. c (1982) (\"A\r\nplaintiff who has lost a declaratory judgment action may also bring a subsequent\r\naction for other relief, subject to the constraint of the determinations made in the\r\ndeclaratory action. The theory is the same: a declaratory [judgment] action\r\ndetermines only what it actually decides and does not have a claim preclusive\r\neffect on other contentions that might have been advanced.\").\r\n\r\n       In this case, the ruling that is entitled to res judicata effect is the\r\ndetermination made in the first action that the Tribe's video poker rights are\r\naffected by future changes in state law, including the statewide ban enacted in\r\nsection 12-21-2710. The question raised in the current declaratory judgment is,\r\naccepting that principle, what is the effect of the 2005 Gambling Cruise Act on the\r\nTribe's rights? This issue was not actually decided in the prior action.\r\nConsequently, we agree with the Tribe's contention that its current declaratory\r\njudgment action is not precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.\r\n\nB.    Effect of Gambling Cruise Act on Tribe's Rights\r\n      The Tribe next contends the circuit court erred in granting summary\r\njudgment to the State after finding the Gambling Cruise Act did not amount to an\r\n\"authorization\" of video poker and similar electronic play devices in South\r\nCarolina. The Tribe asserts \"[t]he State's enactment of the Gambling Cruise Act is\r\nan authorization that triggers the Catawba Nation's right to offer video poker and\r\nsimilar electronic devices on its Reservation pursuant to § 16.8.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The clear terms of the Gambling Cruise Act itself support a finding that it\r\ndoes not alter the statewide ban on video poker, as the General Assembly explicitly\r\nprovided that the Gambling Cruise Act \"must not be construed to . . . repeal or\r\nmodify any other provision of law relating to gambling\" or to \"allow or permit\r\ngambling aboard any vessel, gambling vessel, or passenger cruise liner within the\r\nterritorial waters of the State[.]\" S.C. Code Ann. § 3-11-400(B)(1), (3) (Supp.\r\n2013). The State correctly asserts, \"Video gaming is currently banned in South\r\nCarolina and the Tribe's reliance upon legislation regulating 'cruises to nowhere'\r\ndoes not lift, alter, or modify that ban. If it did, [then] everyone in South Carolina\r\ncould take advantage of the Gambling Cruise Act and could ignore the prohibition\r\nupon video gaming in the State.\"\r\n\r\n      Section 12-21-2710 is currently the law in South Carolina, and it imposes a\r\nstatewide ban on such video gambling devices:\r\n\r\n             It is unlawful for any person to keep on his premises or operate\r\n      or permit to be kept on his premises or operated within this State any\r\n      vending or slot machine, or any video game machine with a free play\r\n      feature operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of\r\n      value, or other device operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin\r\n      or thing of value for the play of poker, blackjack, keno, lotto, bingo,\r\n      or craps . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 21-21-2710 (2014) (emphasis added). In enacting the Gambling\r\nCruise Act, the General Assembly specifically stated that it shall not be construed\r\nto repeal or modify existing law. S.C. Code Ann. § 3-11-400(B)(1), (3). This\r\nCourt has confirmed the continued viability of this statutory scheme in the recent\r\ncase of Union County Sheriff's Office v. Henderson, 395 S.C. 516, 519-20, 719\r\n\nS.E.2d 665, 666 (2011) (\"Section 12-21-2710 makes it unlawful to possess illegal\r\ngambling machines, even if they are not fully operational. The mere possession of\r\ngambling devices, or even their component parts, is unlawful.\").\r\n\r\n      The Tribe avers that it is allowed to offer gambling \"to the same extent\"\r\nallowed by state law, and \"extent\" should be given \"its literal and ordinary\r\nmeaning.\" The Tribe maintains the circuit court improperly added a \"geographical\r\nrestriction to § 16.8 of the [Settlement] Agreement\" as \"[t]he issue is 'what' activity\r\nthe State has authorized, not 'where' the authorized activity may take place.\" The\r\nTribe argues it should not be required \"to have an ocean\" to be able to exercise the\r\nsame rights to video poker as found elsewhere in the state, and there is \"no\r\ngeographical component\" in the Settlement Agreement.\r\n\r\n       We find the Tribe's assertion that it \"does not need to have an ocean\" to\r\nexercise the same rights unavailing because its interpretation of the Gambling\r\nCruise Act, the Settlement Agreement, and the State Act contravenes the\r\nunambiguous terms of the provisions at play here. Contrary to the Tribe's\r\nassertions, the prohibition on video poker is being applied to the Tribe \"to the same\r\nextent\" provided by state law. The ban on video poker devices remains in force\r\nthroughout the territorial limits of South Carolina, including the State's territorial\r\nwaters. Nothing has changed in that regard.\r\n\r\n       Gambling outside the State's territorial waters aboard cruises to nowhere was\r\nlegal in South Carolina pursuant to federal law in the Johnson Act years before the\r\nGambling Cruise Act was enacted. Thus, the Gambling Cruise Act did not\r\n\"authorize\" video poker. Nor can it be deemed an \"authorization\" of video poker\r\ninside the jurisdictional boundaries of South Carolina. For purposes of analogy\r\nonly, the State points to an unreported decision from the United States District\r\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida,\r\n1993 WL 475999 (S.D. Fla. 1993). That case involved the Indian Gaming\r\nRegulatory Act, or IGRA, which the State acknowledges does not apply to the\r\nTribe since the Tribe opted out of the IGRA in its Settlement Agreement.5\r\n5 Congress passed the IGRA in 1988, and it expressly permits gambling on Indian\r\nreservations under certain prescribed circumstances. Brizill v. Dist. of Columbia\r\nBd. of Elections & Ethics, 911 A.2d 1212, 1216 n.7 (D.C. 2006). Because of this,\r\ngambling casinos are legal on many Indian reservations despite the prohibitions of\r\n§ 1175 of the Johnson Act. Id.; see also Deborah F. Buckman, Interplay Between\r\nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act and Johnson Act, 2 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 241, 241 (2005)\r\n\nHowever, the State cites it for the federal court's finding that Florida's\r\nauthorization of \"cruises to nowhere\" did not undermine that state's existing\r\nprohibition against gaming and it did not serve to authorize casino gambling\r\n\"within the State.\"\r\n\r\n       In our view, the Gambling Cruise Act merely delegates the State's authority\r\nto opt out of the federal Johnson Act to political subdivisions, such as cities and\r\ncounties. Under any interpretation, the Gambling Cruise Act does not authorize\r\nthe utilization of video poker devices anywhere in the State's territorial limits, be it\r\non land or within the State's territorial waters.\r\n\r\n       The Tribe states its gaming rights are unique and that it is \"not 'like everyone\r\nelse' in South Carolina with regard to gaming rights, and [it] should not be treated\r\n'like everyone else.'  \" In this regard, the Tribe notes: \"For example, members of\r\nthe Catawba Nation are the beneficiaries of a Tribal Trust Fund, are exempt from\r\ncertain federal and state income taxes, and are exempt from state and county taxes\r\non personal property, including automobiles. In addition, the Catawba Nation's\r\nreal property is exempt from county and state property taxes, sales on the\r\nReservation are exempt from sales taxes, and it has the right to operate for-profit\r\nhigh-stakes bingo games.\"\r\n\r\n      We agree the Tribe is not treated the same as everyone else in certain\r\nrespects of the law. However, none of the examples pointed out by the Tribe\r\ninvolve video poker. Moreover, in regards to \"video poker or similar electronic\r\nplay devices,\" the Tribe has specifically agreed to be treated like everyone else.\r\nWe hold the circuit court correctly determined the Gambling Cruise Act does not\r\nauthorize the Tribe to offer video poker on its Reservation.\r\n\r\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       We conclude the Tribe's action is not precluded by collateral estoppel or res\r\njudicata and reverse this finding by the circuit court. We affirm, however, the\r\ncircuit court's determination that the Gambling Cruise Act does not authorize the\r\nTribe to offer video poker on its Reservation in contravention of the existing\r\nstatewide ban on video gambling devices.\r\n\r\n(\"The [IGRA] . . . was enacted in 1988 in order to provide a statutory basis for the\r\noperation of gaming by Indian tribes and to balance tribal interests with those of\r\nthe states in which they were located.\").\r\n\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\n     PLEICONES, Acting Chief Justice, KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and\r\nActing Justice Ralph Keith Kelly, concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27375","title":"State v.

We\r\naffirm.\r\n\n                                          I. \n\r\n\r\nShurling was appointed to represent an indigent defendant in a criminal\r\nprosecution for murder, assault with intent to kill, criminal conspiracy, possession\r\nof a weapon during a violent crime, and possession of marijuana. Shurling sought\r\napproval for her fees and expenses to exceed the statutory caps provided by the\r\nSouth Carolina Indigent Defense Act.1 Judge Childs, then the Chief\r\nAdministrative Judge for the Richland County Court of General Sessions, signed\r\ntwo orders, one addressing attorney's fees and the other addressing expenses. In\r\nthe first order, Judge Childs found it was \"reasonable and proper\" to award\r\nattorney's fees in excess of the statutory limits. Thus, Judge Childs awarded\r\nShurling fees at the rate of $100 per hour and also authorized fees up to $15,000.00\r\n\"without further advance approval of [the] Court.\"2 In the second order, Judge\r\nChilds addressed expenses and authorized up to $2,500 \"without prior\r\nauthorization from [the] court.\" (emphasis omitted). Specifically, Judge Childs'\r\norder allowed $1,000 for witness fees, mileage, and subpoena service and $1,500\r\nfor all other expenses (\"general expenses\").3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. §§ 17-3-5 to -600 (2014). Section 17-3-50(A) of the South\r\nCarolina Code provides that private appointed counsel are to \"be paid a reasonable\r\nfee to be determined on the basis of forty dollars an hour for time spent out of court\r\nand sixty dollars an hour for time spent in court.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 17-3-50(A)\r\n(2014). The total attorney's fees may not exceed $3,500. Id. Attorneys are\r\nauthorized to seek up to five hundred dollars for expenses \"[u]pon a finding in ex\r\nparte proceedings that investigative, expert, or other services are reasonably\r\nnecessary for the representation of the defendant.\" Id. § 17-3-50(B). Section 17-\r\n3-50(C) provides that payment in excess of these limits is \"authorized only if the\r\ncourt certifies, in a written order with specific findings of fact, that payment in\r\nexcess of the rates is necessary.\" Id. § 17-3-50(C) (emphasis added).\r\n2Judge Childs also authorized the appointment of Shurling's associate, Jeremy A.\r\nThompson. Thompson was allotted $40 per hour for out-of-court work and $60\r\nper hour for in-court time.\r\n3Judge Childs was subsequently nominated and confirmed as a United States\r\nDistrict Court judge.\r\n\nAfter the conclusion of the trial, which lasted a week, Shurling requested a total of\r\n$44,426.00 in fees and $1,962.66 in general expenses.4 Circuit Judge James R.\r\nBarber, III held two hearings to address these vouchers and ordered that Shurling\r\nand Thompson be paid fees and expenses subject to the preapproved limits set by\r\nJudge Childs. Shurling appealed, and this Court certified the appeal pursuant to\r\nRule 204(b), SCACR.                       II.\r\n\r\nShurling raises a number of issues on appeal, which we have distilled down to two\r\ndispositive issues: (1) whether Shurling is entitled to attorney's fees in excess of the\r\npreapproved amount of $15,000; and (2) whether Shurling is entitled to\r\nreimbursement for general expenses in excess of the preapproved amount of\r\n$1,500.5\r\n\r\nShurling claims that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting her fees to the\r\npreapproved amount of $15,000 based on Judge Childs' order. We disagree. Judge\r\nChilds' order, which is controlling in this case, provides that Shurling \"may submit\r\nfor approval by the [c]ourt a voucher for payment [of] fees up to $15,000.00\r\nwithout further advance approval.\" (emphasis added). It is uncontested that\r\nShurling submitted a bill for attorney's fees in excess of $15,000, yet she never\r\nsought further advance approval to exceed the preapproved amount of $15,000.\r\nBecause Judge Childs' order is unambiguous in its requirement that further\r\npreapproval was necessary to incur fees in excess of $15,000, we find no abuse of\r\ndiscretion and affirm the trial court's award of attorney's fees.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4Shurling submitted a fee voucher for $33,020.00 and Thompson submitted a fee\r\nvoucher for $11,406.00.\r\n5Shurling raises additional challenges to the trial court's order, which we find are\r\nunpreserved or manifestly without merit. Accordingly, those additional challenges\r\nare affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.\r\n6 Shurling urges this Court to construe the Indigent Defense Act to allow court-\r\nappointed attorneys to submit bills in excess of the statutory caps at the end of their\r\nrepresentation without prior court approval. Because the clear language of Judge\r\nChilds' initial funding order is controlling in this case, we do not reach Shurling's\r\nstatutory construction argument.\r\n\nSimilarly, Shurling claims that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to\r\nauthorize the payment of more than $1,500 in general expenses. Judge Childs'\r\norder specifically noted that general expenses were not to exceed the amounts set\r\nforth in her order absent further prior authorization from the court. Again, there\r\nwas no request seeking advance approval for expenses in excess of the amounts\r\npreapproved by Judge Childs. Thus, we affirm the trial court's award of $1,500 in\r\ngeneral expenses.                        III.\r\n\r\nWe are cognizant of the fact that Shurling and co-counsel expended considerable\r\ntime in the underlying criminal trial, and we commend them for their laudable\r\nservice to the profession. Shurling epitomizes the professionalism of our Bar\r\nmembers who serve the much needed role of providing legal counsel to those who\r\ncannot afford it. Indeed, our honored profession is committed to providing access\r\nto justice for all. Nowhere is this more evident than where members of the legal\r\nprofession represent indigent criminal defendants. In this case, however, in light of\r\nthe unambiguous language of Judge Childs' orders and the failure to seek further\r\nadvance approval to incur attorney's fees in excess of $15,000 and general\r\nexpenses in excess of $1,500, we are constrained to affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.\r\nMoore, concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27376","title":"Lord v.

Gopal, Inc., 395 S.C. 129, 716 S.E.2d 910 (2011) (\"Gopal II\"), which is\r\nused to determine a business owner's duty to protect a patron based on the\r\n\nforeseeability of violent acts by third parties, applied prospectively; and (2)\r\ngranting summary judgment as she presented a genuine issue of material fact on\r\neach element of her negligence claim. We reverse the order of the circuit court and\r\nremand for trial because we find Gopal II applies to the facts of the instant case\r\nand its application warranted the denial of D & J's motion for summary judgment.\r\n\r\n                       I.    Factual / Procedural History\r\n\r\n       D & J is a South Carolina corporation that operates businesses involving\r\ncheck cashing, \"pay day\" lending, and motor vehicle title lending. One of its\r\nbusinesses is Cash on the Spot, which is located in Rock Hill, South Carolina.\r\nCash on the Spot is outfitted with iron bars on the windows of its building and\r\nbulletproof glass on its teller's windows for the protection of its employees.\r\n\r\n        On February 14, 2008, Lord went to Cash on the Spot to retrieve money\r\nwired to her using Western Union. As she approached the teller's window, a man\r\nseated at a nearby table stood up, reached under his clothing, pulled out a pistol,\r\nand shot Lord in the head and back. The man then demanded money as he slid his\r\nweapon through the opening in the teller's window. Marsha Boyd, the manager of\r\nthe store who was stationed behind the bulletproof teller's window and had access\r\nto a silent alarm, immediately called 911. The man then fled the premises.\r\n\r\n       The incident, which lasted approximately six seconds, was captured on the\r\nstore's security camera. As a result of this video and DNA recovered from a pen\r\nthat the man had put in his mouth, law enforcement was able to identify the suspect\r\nas Phillip Watts, Jr.\r\n\r\n      After Watts was apprehended, he confessed to committing seven armed\r\nrobberies in York County. The string of robberies, which began in October 2007\r\nand primarily targeted small businesses, was the subject of significant media\r\ncoverage. Prior to the Cash on the Spot incident, Watts robbed Rock Hill's\r\nSaltwater Seafood Market on January 28, 2008, and Fort Mill's John Boy's Valero\r\non February 5, 2008. During these robberies, Watts shot two store clerks and a\r\nbystander. Before the February 14, 2008 incident involving Lord, the owner of\r\nCash on the Spot warned his employees to be vigilant because \"there is a madman\r\non the loose.\"\r\n\r\n       On May 15, 2008, a York County grand jury indicted Watts for assault and\r\nbattery with intent to kill and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\nviolent crime stemming from the shooting of Lord. Ultimately, Watts entered a\r\n\nplea of guilty but mentally ill to these charges and the other armed robberies and\r\nwas sentenced to a term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\r\n\r\n       On June 19, 2009, Lord filed an action for negligence against D & J,\r\nalleging the business breached its duty to her \"to use reasonable care for her safety\"\r\nbecause it failed to implement security features such as posting a security guard on\r\nthe premises.\r\n\r\n      D & J answered and moved for summary judgment. In support of its\r\nmotion, D & J filed a memorandum wherein it argued that it had no duty to protect\r\nLord from the injuries caused by Watts. Citing Miletic v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\r\n339 S.C. 327, 529 S.E.2d 68 (Ct. App. 2000),1 D & J asserted it was not\r\n\r\n1 In Miletic, the plaintiff brought suit against Wal-Mart after she was abducted at\r\ngunpoint from the store parking lot on September 2, 1993. Miletic, 339 S.C. at\r\n329, 529 S.E.2d at 68. The plaintiff alleged Wal-Mart had a duty to her as its\r\ncustomer to protect her from the criminal acts of third persons committed in the\r\nstore's parking lot. Id. at 329, 529 S.E.2d at 68-69. In opposition to Wal-Mart's\r\nmotion for summary judgment, the plaintiff submitted incident reports detailing\r\ncriminal activity in or near the shopping center's parking lot in the two years\r\npreceding her abduction. Id. at 329, 529 S.E.2d at 69. The plaintiff also submitted\r\nan affidavit from a security consultant who stated that his security company had\r\nrecommended in 1996 that Wal-Mart employ security, at the least an unarmed\r\nbicycle patrol, in its parking areas because of the subdued lighting required by city\r\ncode. Id. After the trial judge granted Wal-Mart's motion, the plaintiff appealed to\r\nthe Court of Appeals. Id.\r\n\r\n  In affirming the grant of summary judgment, the Court of Appeals referenced\r\nthis Court's decision in Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., 269 S.C. 479,\r\n238 S.E.2d 167 (1977) as the established approach in determining the \"scope of the\r\nduty of merchants.\" Id. at 330, 529 S.C. at 69. Specifically, the court stated,\r\n\"There is no duty . . . upon merchants and shopkeepers generally, whose mode of\r\noperation of their premises does not attract or provide a climate for crime, to guard\r\nagainst the criminal acts of a third party, unless they know or have reason to know\r\nthat acts are occurring or about to occur on the premises that pose imminent\r\nprobability of harm to an invitee.\" Id. (quoting Shipes, 269 S.C. at 484, 238 S.E.2d\r\nat 169). Although the court recognized that \"the law ha[d] evolved in other\r\njurisdictions since the Supreme Court articulated the scope of the duty of\r\nmerchants under such circumstances in Shipes,\" it declined to deviate from the\r\napproach taken in Shipes. Id. Applying the test espoused in Shipes, the court\r\n\nforeseeable that Watts would shoot Lord because Watts appeared to be a regular\r\ncustomer and the incident lasted less than six seconds. D & J further noted there\r\nwere \"no prior attempted armed robberies [at Cash on the Spot], or any type of\r\nviolen[t] offense[s] against either employees or patrons.\" Additionally, D & J\r\nclaimed there was no evidence presented to establish that Cash on the Spot was\r\nlocated in a dangerous area or constituted a business that attracts or provides a\r\nclimate for crime. Given these facts, D & J maintained that the presence of a\r\nsecurity guard would not have deterred Watts from entering Cash on the Spot or\r\nprevented the shooting.\r\n\r\n       In opposition to D & J's motion, Lord filed a memorandum wherein she\r\nasserted D & J's \"personnel knew about Watts'[s] prior armed robberies and related\r\nshootings and appreciated the threat posed by Watts\" yet failed to post a security\r\nguard at the entrance of Cash on the Spot. As a result, Lord asserted D & J's\r\nbreach of its duty to her proximately caused her \"catastrophic brain injuries.\"\r\n\r\n       Lord supplemented the memorandum with: (1) the deposition testimony of\r\nDarrell Starnes, who is the President of D & J and oversees the day-to-day\r\noperations of the corporation; (2) the deposition testimony of Boyd; (3) the\r\naffidavit of Robert Clark, a \"private security expert\" who opined D & J was aware\r\nof the threat posed by Watts and should have posted a security guard at the\r\nentrance of the business; and (4) newspaper articles and media coverage of the\r\nprevious robberies committed by Watts.\r\n\r\n       After a hearing, the circuit court granted D & J's motion for summary\r\njudgment by order dated October 26, 2011. In so ruling, the court noted that at the\r\ntime of the shooting in 2008 \"the law governing the scope of the duty of merchants\r\nto protect invitees against criminal acts of third parties in South Carolina was\r\ngoverned by Miletic v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 339 S.C. 327, 529 S.E.2d 68 (S.C.\r\nApp. 2000), citing Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., 269 S.C. 479, 484,\r\n238 S.E.2d 167, 169 (1977).\" However, the court recognized that during the\r\n\r\nfound Wal-Mart had no duty under South Carolina law to protect the plaintiff from\r\nan attack like the one she suffered. Id. at 333, 529 S.E.2d at 70. In reaching this\r\nconclusion, the court noted that Wal-Mart had \"no notice of any comparable\r\nviolent crimes occurring in the two years prior, and no incidents occurred on that\r\nparticular night to put Wal-Mart on notice of an impending violent carjacking.\" Id.\r\nat 333, 529 S.E.2d at 70-71. Accordingly, because Wal-Mart had no duty to\r\nprotect the plaintiff, it could not have negligently breached that duty. Id. at 333,\r\n529 S.E.2d at 71.\r\n\npendency of the proceedings this Court issued its opinion in Gopal II, which\r\n\"abandoned the imminent harm test [of Shipes] and adopted the balancing\r\napproach previously discussed in Miletic.\" Although the court believed Gopal II\r\napplied prospectively, it nevertheless analyzed the facts of the case under both\r\nShipes and Gopal II.\r\n\r\n       Applying the \"imminent harm test\" enunciated in Shipes, the court rejected\r\nLord's contention that D & J was aware of the specific and imminent harm. Even\r\nthough Starnes warned his employees prior to the shooting that \"a madman was on\r\nthe loose,\" the court found there was no history of criminal activity on the premises\r\nof Cash on the Spot and there was no out of the ordinary behavior by Watts\r\nimmediately prior to the shooting that would have put Lord or Boyd on notice of\r\nthe shooting. As a result, the court determined D & J had no duty to protect Lord\r\nfrom the criminal actions of Watts.\r\n\r\n       Notwithstanding the circuit court's conclusion that Gopal II applied\r\nprospectively, the court proceeded to analyze Lord's claim using Gopal II.\r\nPursuant to the balancing test of Gopal II, the court found Lord produced at least a\r\nscintilla of evidence that the crime was foreseeable. The court referenced the\r\ndeposition testimony of Starnes and found it \"clearly indicates that [D & J] actually\r\ndid foresee the possibility of a third party criminal act, and even warned [its]\r\nemployees to 'be on their toes, to look for suspicious people' because 'there was a\r\nmadman . . . on the loose.' \" Despite this finding, the court ruled that Lord failed to\r\nprovide any evidence the security measures taken by D & J were unreasonable\r\ngiven the risk. Specifically, the court concluded Clark's expert opinion was not\r\nsufficient to establish the need for hiring costly security guards as there was no\r\nevidence of prior crimes on the premises of Cash on the Spot. Ultimately, the\r\ncourt held D & J had no duty to hire a security guard because it had implemented\r\nreasonable security measures.\r\n\r\n       Following the denial of her motion to reconsider, Lord appealed the circuit\r\ncourt's order to the Court of Appeals. This Court certified the appeal pursuant to\r\nRule 204(b) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.\r\n\r\n                                  II.    Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Arguments\r\n\r\n      In challenging the circuit court's order, Lord contends the court erred in\r\nfinding the \"balancing approach\" established by this Court in Gopal II applied\r\n\nprospectively. Because the balancing approach adopted in Gopal II \"does not\r\ncreate liability where previously none existed,\" Lord maintains it should apply\r\nretroactively and control the resolution of the instant case.\r\n\r\n       Applying Gopal II, Lord asserts the court erred in granting summary\r\njudgment to D & J because she presented at least a scintilla of evidence showing a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact as to each element of her negligence claim.\r\nSpecifically, Lord asserts: (1) D & J owed a duty to her as she was a business\r\ninvitee on the premises of Cash on the Spot; (2) the risk of harm to her was\r\nforeseeable because Starnes admitted he knew before the shooting that \"there was a\r\nmadman on the loose\" and reviewed procedures with D & J employees regarding a\r\nresponse to a potential armed robbery; (3) D & J failed to post a security guard at\r\nthe entrance of Cash on the Spot despite the foreseen risk of a shooting; (4) Clark's\r\naffidavit established that the shooting of Lord \"most probably would not have\r\noccurred if D & J had posted a security guard\"; and (5) there is evidence the\r\nshooting caused Lord to suffer profound neurological complications.\r\n\r\nB.    Standard of Review\r\n\r\n       The parties presented this case in the posture of a motion for summary\r\njudgment; thus, it is governed by Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure. This rule provides a motion for summary judgment shall be granted \"if\r\nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\r\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. \"An appellate court reviews the granting of summary\r\njudgment under the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56,\r\nSCRCP.\" Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688,\r\n692 (2000).\r\n\r\n        \"Under Rule 56(c), the party seeking summary judgment has the initial\r\nresponsibility of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\r\nBaughman v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).\r\nThis initial responsibility may be discharged by pointing out to the trial court that\r\nthere is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case, and it is not\r\nnecessary for the moving party to support its motion with affidavits or other similar\r\nmaterials negating the opponent's claim. Id. Once the moving party carries its\r\ninitial burden, the opposing party must do more than rest upon the mere allegations\r\nor denials of his pleadings, but must, by affidavit or otherwise, set forth specific\r\nfacts to show that there is a genuine issue for trial. Id.; Rule 56(e), SCRCP.\r\n\n       \"In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view\r\nthe evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.\" David v. McLeod Reg'l Med.\r\nCtr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006). \"[I]n cases applying the\r\npreponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\nrequired to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion for\r\nsummary judgment.\" Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673\r\nS.E.2d 801, 803 (2009). \"Summary judgment is not appropriate where further\r\ninquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.\"\r\nLanham v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of S.C., 349 S.C. 356, 362, 563 S.E.2d 331,\r\n333 (2002). Moreover, because summary judgment is a drastic remedy, it should\r\nbe cautiously invoked to ensure a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on\r\ndisputed factual issues. Madison ex rel. Bryant v. Babcock Ctr., Inc., 371 S.C.\r\n123, 134, 638 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2006).\r\n\r\nC.    Effect of Court's Adoption of the Gopal II Balancing Test in 2011\r\n\r\n       To resolve this appeal, we must first determine whether our decision in\r\nGopal II should apply prospectively or retrospectively and, in turn, to the instant\r\ncase. In South Carolina, \"[t]he general rule regarding retroactive application of\r\njudicial decisions is that decisions creating new substantive rights have prospective\r\neffect only, whereas decisions creating new remedies to vindicate existing rights\r\nare applied retrospectively.\" Carolina Chloride, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 391\r\nS.C. 429, 433, 706 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2011) (citation omitted). \"Prospective\r\napplication is required when liability is created where formerly none existed.\" Id.\r\nat 433-34, 706 S.E.2d at 503. \"As a common rule, judicial decisions in civil cases\r\nare presumptively retroactive.\" Miranda C. v. Nissan Motor Co., 402 S.C. 577,\r\n586, 741 S.E.2d 34, 39 (Ct. App. 2013).\r\n\r\n       Applying the above-outlined rules, we find the balancing approach in Gopal\r\nII should be applied retrospectively because our decision created no new duty for\r\nbusiness owners, but, rather, clarified the test in assessing the scope of this duty.\r\n\r\n       Gopal II involved a premises liability action that arose out of the shooting of\r\nGerald Bass while he was a guest at the Super 8 Motel in Orangeburg, South\r\nCarolina. Gopal II, 395 S.C. at 132, 716 S.E.2d at 912. Gopal, Inc., which is a\r\nfranchisee of Super 8, owned and operated the motel. Id. During the evening of\r\nSeptember 28, 1999, Bass and his roommate, Wayne Kinlaw, were turning in for\r\nthe evening when they received a knock at their door by a man that Bass had seen\r\nearlier that evening at a nearby convenience store. Id. The door was equipped\r\n\nwith a peep hole and there was a large plate glass window beside the door. Id.\r\nAfter the third knock, Bass and Kinlaw opened the door without first looking to see\r\nwho was there and then stepped outside. Id. When Bass refused the man's demand\r\nfor money, the man shot Bass in the leg with a handgun and fled on foot. Id.\r\n\r\n      In September 2002, Bass filed a complaint alleging negligence against\r\nGopal, Inc. and Super 8. Id. Gopal, Inc. and Super 8 each filed motions for\r\nsummary judgment, which were granted by the circuit court. The Court of Appeals\r\naffirmed. Bass v. Gopal, Inc., 384 S.C. 238, 680 S.E.2d 917 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n(\"Gopal I\"). This Court granted Bass's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals. Gopal II, 395 S.C. at 133, 716 S.E.2d at 912.\r\n\r\n       In Gopal II, we considered whether the Court of Appeals erred in upholding\r\nthe circuit court's finding that Gopal, Inc., as the appeal against Super 8 had been\r\ndismissed, did not have a duty to protect Bass from the criminal act of a third\r\nparty. Id. Chief Justice Toal, writing for the majority, noted that the threshold\r\nquestion in any negligence action is whether the defendant owed a duty to the\r\nplaintiff. Id. at 134, 716 S.E.2d at 913. Although the Court recognized \"an\r\ninnkeeper is not the insurer of [the] safety of its guests,\" it stated that \"an innkeeper\r\n'is under a duty to its guests to take reasonable action to protect them against\r\nunreasonable risk of physical harm.' \" Id. (quoting Allen v. Greenville Hotel\r\nPartners, Inc., 405 F. Supp. 2d 653, 659 (D.S.C. 2005)). The Court explained that\r\n\"a business owner has a duty to take a reasonable action to protect its invitees\r\nagainst the foreseeable risk of physical harm.\" Id. at 135, 716 S.E.2d at 913.\r\n\r\n        In assessing the foreseeability issue, the Court surveyed the approaches\r\ntaken by jurisdictions across the country and identified four approaches: (1) under\r\nthe \"imminent harm rule,\" which was adopted by this Court in Shipes and cited in\r\nMiletic, the landowner owes no duty to protect patrons from violent acts of third\r\nparties unless he is aware of specific and imminent harm about to befall him; (2)\r\npursuant to the second approach, which is known as the \"prior or similar incidents\r\ntest,\" foreseeability may be established only by evidence of previous crimes on or\r\nnear the premises; (3) the third approach, which is known as the \"totality of the\r\ncircumstances test,\" requires the court to consider all relevant factual\r\ncircumstances, including the nature, condition, and location of the land as well as\r\nprior similar incidents; and (4) under the fourth approach the court engages in a\r\nbalancing test, which balances the degree of foreseeability of harm against the duty\r\nimposed. Id. at 135-39, 716 S.E.2d at 913-15.\r\n\n      After giving due consideration to each test and the associated policy\r\nimplications, the Court adopted the balancing approach. Id. at 139, 716 S.E.2d at\r\n915. In reaching this decision, the Court recognized that \" '[t]he balancing\r\napproach acknowledges that duty is a flexible concept, and seeks to balance the\r\ndegree of foreseeability of harm against the burden of the duty imposed.' \" Id. at\r\n138, 716 S.E.2d at 915 (quoting McClung v. Delta Square Ltd. P'ship, 937 S.W.2d\r\n891, 901 (Tenn. 1996)). The Court explained that \"the more foreseeable a crime,\r\nthe more onerous is a business owner's burden of providing security.\" Id. at 138,\r\n716 S.E.2d at 915. Accordingly, \"[u]nder this test, the presence or absence of prior\r\ncriminal incidents is a significant factor in determining the amount of security\r\nrequired of a business owner, but their absence does not foreclose the duty to\r\nprovide some level of security if other factors support a heightened risk.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       In adopting the balancing approach, the Court emphasized that it was not\r\naltering the \"consistently imposed . . . duty on business owners to employ\r\nreasonable measures to protect invitees from foreseeable harm.\" Id. at 139, 716\r\nS.E.2d at 915. Rather, the Court \"merely elucidate[d] how to determine (1) if a\r\ncrime is foreseeable, and (2) given the foreseeability, determine the economically\r\nfeasible security measures required to prevent such harm.\" Id. The Court further\r\nnoted that \"[t]he optimal point at which a dollar spent equals a dollar's worth of\r\nprevention will not always be apparent, but may be roughly ascertained with the\r\naid of an expert, or some other testimony.\" Id. In replacing the \"imminent harm\r\ntest\" adopted in Shipes, the Court found the \"the balancing approach appropriately\r\nweighs both the economic concerns of businesses, and the safety concerns of their\r\npatrons.\" Id. By adopting this test, the Court hoped to \" 'encourage a reasonable\r\nresponse to the crime phenomenon without making unreasonable demands.' \" Id. at\r\n139, 716 S.E.2d at 915-16 (quoting McClung, 937 S.W.2d at 902).\r\n\r\n       Applying the balancing approach to the facts of Bass's case, the Court found\r\nthe Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\nGopal, Inc. Id. at 142, 716 S.E.2d at 917. In reaching this decision, the Court\r\ndetermined that Bass presented \"at least some evidence the aggravated assault was\r\nforeseeable\" because Bass produced a CRIMECAST report that showed, in 1999,\r\nthe risk of rape, robbery, and aggravated assaults at the Super 8 as compared to the\r\nnational average risk, the state average risk, and the county average risk. Id. at\r\n141, 716 S.E.2d at 916. Based on this report, the Court found \"the especial high\r\nprobability of crime at the Super 8 compared to the national and state averages\r\nraised at least a scintilla of evidence that the crime against [Bass] was foreseeable.\"\r\nId.\r\n\n        The Court, however, found Bass did not provide any evidence that Gopal\r\nInc.'s preventative measures were unreasonable given the risk of criminal activity\r\non the property. Id. at 142, 716 S.E.2d at 917. Although Bass presented the\r\ndeposition testimony of an expert who \"concluded the addition of a closed circuit\r\ncamera or some type of additional security personnel would have been reasonable\r\nin light of his perceived risk,\" the Court found Bass \"failed to provide any evidence\r\nthat [Gopal, Inc.] should have expended more resources to curtail the risk of\r\ncriminal activity that might have been probable.\" Id. Instead, the Court found\r\ndeterminative the expert's statement that \"if . . . this is [the] first time [a criminal\r\nincident occurred], there wasn't enough data for [Gopal, Inc.] to say he really\r\nneeded to spend a bunch of money on surveillance cameras, a bunch of money on a\r\nfull-time security guard or part-time, or train his employees to do a guard tour . . .\r\n.\" Id.2Upon further review of Gopal II, we now definitively hold that this decision\r\napplies retrospectively. Significantly, we implicitly announced this rule in 2011\r\nwhen we applied the balancing test to Bass's case, which arose out of a criminal act\r\nthat occurred in 1999. As to the substance of our decision, there is no evidence to\r\nrebut the presumption that Gopal II is to be applied retrospectively because we did\r\nnot create any new right, liability, or cause of action. Although Gopal II\r\n\"replaced\" the \"outdated\" imminent harm rule in Shipes with a balancing test, we\r\ndid not alter the well-established duty of a merchant3 to take reasonable action to\r\nprotect invitees against an unreasonable risk of physical harm. Rather, this Court\r\n\r\n2 Justice Pleicones concurred in the majority's decision to affirm the grant of\r\nsummary judgment in favor of Gopal, Inc.; however, he would have done so \"on\r\nthe ground that petitioner's negligence in leaving the safety of his motel room\r\nexceeded respondent's negligence, if any, as a matter of law.\" Gopal II, 395 S.C.\r\nat 143, 716 S.E.2d at 917 (citing Gopal I, 384 S.C. at 247, 680 S.E.2d at 921-22).\r\nJustice Pleicones further noted that he \"perceive[d] little difference between our\r\nexisting law [regarding the duty of an innkeeper to her guests], and the test adopted\r\nby the majority, other than the requirement for expert testimony, and reliance upon\r\ncity/county statistics.\" Id. at 143, 716 S.E.2d at 918. If in fact the majority altered\r\nexisting law, Justice Pleicones would have remanded to allow the parties an\r\nopportunity to address the newly announced test. Id.\r\n3 Even though Gopal II involved an assessment of the duty of an innkeeper, this\r\ndoes not affect the disposition of this case involving a merchant because \"the\r\nanswer to whether a defendant has breached any duty remains the same under\r\neither analysis.\" Gopal I, 384 S.C. at 245, 680 S.E.2d at 920.\r\n\nmodified the scope of this duty because we \"merely elucidated\" how to determine\r\n(1) if a crime is foreseeable, and (2) the economically feasible security measures\r\nthat are required to prevent the foreseeable harm. Thus, we apply Gopal II to the\r\nfacts of instant case.\r\n\r\nD.    Application of Gopal II Balancing Test to Instant Case\r\n\r\n      Applying the Gopal II balancing test, we hold the circuit court erred in\r\ngranting summary judgment to D & J. Viewing the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to Lord, we find she presented at least a scintilla of evidence to withstand\r\nthe motion for summary judgment as to her negligence claim against D & J.\r\n\r\n      To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish duty, breach,\r\ncausation, and damages. Daniel v. Days Inn of Am., Inc., 292 S.C. 291, 295, 356\r\nS.E.2d 129, 131 (Ct. App. 1987). The key determination in the instant case is\r\nwhether D & J breached its duty to take reasonable action to protect Lord, its\r\nbusiness invitee, against the foreseeable risk of physical harm.\r\n\r\n       Regarding the foreseeability prong of Gopal II, Lord presented the\r\ndeposition testimony of Starnes, the owner of D & J, and Boyd, the manager of\r\nCash on the Spot the day of the shooting. Starnes and Boyd testified they were\r\naware of the prior robberies in York County because the local newspapers had\r\ncovered the incidents. Prior to the shooting, Starnes discussed the robberies with\r\nhis employees and warned them to \"be on their toes to look out for suspicious\r\npeople\" because there was a \"madman on the loose.\" Based on the foregoing, we\r\nfind, as did the circuit court, Lord produced at least some evidence that the\r\nshooting was foreseeable.\r\n\r\n       Having determined Lord produced some evidence as to foreseeability of the\r\nrisk of harm, the question becomes whether D & J's preventative security measures\r\nwere unreasonable given this risk. Lord primarily asserts that D & J should have\r\nposted a security guard at the entrance of Cash on the Spot. Although this Court in\r\nGopal II acknowledged the significant cost associated with hiring security guards\r\nabsent evidence of prior crimes on the premises, we stated that a plaintiff may\r\nproduce evidence of this prong through the testimony of an expert. Here, unlike\r\nthe plaintiff in Gopal II, Lord presented expert testimony precisely on this point.\r\n\r\n      Robert Clark, Lord's expert in private security, reviewed the media coverage\r\nof the prior armed robberies, the deposition testimonies of Starnes and Boyd, and\r\nconducted a field investigation of the security measures used at Cash on the Spot.\r\n\nBased on his investigation, Clark opined that D & J \"had a duty, in the exercise of\r\nreasonable care, to post a security guard at the entrance of\" Cash on the Spot in\r\norder to \"provide reasonable protection for its employees and customers against the\r\nthreat of a serial armed robber who had shot two store clerks and a bystander in\r\ntwo previous armed robberies of businesses that fit the profile of D & J's business.\"\r\nHe further stated, \"The armed robbery attempt during which Ida Lord was shot\r\nmost probably would not have occurred if D & J had posted a security guard at the\r\nentrance of its check cashing location on Cherry Road in Rock Hill, South\r\nCarolina.\"\r\n\r\n       Under the specific facts presented in this case, we find the expert testimony\r\nwas sufficient to create a question of fact for the jury. See Louis A. Lehr, Jr., 1\r\nPremises Liability 3d § 4:7 (Supp. 2013) (\"A common type of claim is one\r\npredicated on security guards the complete absence, or an inadequate number\r\nand/or inadequate training. A typical case is one in which an expert testifies that\r\nthe presence of a security [guard] would have prevented the crime. Courts have\r\nheld that such expert testimony is sufficient to make a fact question for the jury.\"\r\n(footnote omitted)); see also Midkiff v. Hines, 866 S.W.2d 328, 333 (Tex. Ct. App.\r\n1993) (reversing grant of summary judgment where \"[o]ne expert testified that if a\r\nuniformed security guard had been stationed on the property as a visible deterrent,\r\nthe murder would have been deterred or prevented\"). See generally E.L. Kellett,\r\nAnnotation, Private Person's Duty and Liability for Failure to Protect Another\r\nAgainst Criminal Attack by Third Person, 10 A.L.R.3d 619 (1966 & Supp. 2013)\r\n(referencing Shipes, Miletic, and Gopal II as well as other state and federal cases\r\nanalyzing a business owner's duty to protect its customers from criminal activity by\r\nthird parties).                  III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\n       Given the summary judgment posture of this case, we conclude it is\r\npremature to deprive Lord of the opportunity to present her case to a jury. As we\r\nnoted in Gopal II, \"whether a business proprietor's security measures were\r\nreasonable in light of a risk will, at many times, be identified by an expert.\" Gopal\r\nII, 395 S.C. at 141, 716 S.E.2d at 917. Here, Lord presented such expert\r\ntestimony. At this stage, it is not the role of the circuit court or this Court to\r\ndetermine whether Lord will prevail on her negligence claim, but whether she\r\npresented a mere scintilla of evidence to withstand D & J's motion for summary\r\njudgment.\r\n\n       We emphasize that our decision should not be construed as requiring all\r\nmerchants to hire costly security guards.4 Instead, we merely find that it is for a\r\njury to decide whether D & J employed reasonable security measures to fulfill its\r\nduty to protect Lord from the foreseeable risk of a shooting. Clearly, D & J\r\nrecognized that it was susceptible to an armed robbery at Cash on the Spot as it had\r\ninstalled security cameras and placed bars on the office windows. It also sought to\r\nprotect its employees by placing them behind bulletproof glass, equipping them\r\nwith panic buttons, and providing them with immediate access to a silent alarm.\r\nThe circumstances of this case, however, presented a heightened risk of danger\r\nbeyond the ordinary operation of Cash on the Spot. As evidenced by Starnes's\r\ndeposition testimony, there was a foreseeable risk of a shooting at Cash on the Spot\r\ngiven the rash of armed robberies that culminated in the shootings of store clerks\r\nand customers at nearby businesses. Under these unique facts, we cannot find that\r\nD & J was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Lord's cause of action for\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\n\r\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n     TOAL, C.J., and HEARN, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a\r\nseparate opinion. KITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4  The dissent clearly misconstrues our decision, stating \"Today the Court holds\r\nthat a merchant has a duty to provide a security guard where random acts of\r\ncriminal violence occur miles away from the business.\" Such an interpretation is\r\nerroneous as we make no such definitive determination regarding a merchant's\r\nduty. Rather, we adhere to our decision in Gopal II that a plaintiff, who offers\r\nevidence of whether a business proprietor's security measures were reasonable in\r\nlight of a risk, may withstand a motion for summary judgment. Lord, as the party\r\nopposing the motion for summary judgment, properly offered expert testimony that\r\nD & J's preventative security measures were unreasonable given the foreseeable\r\nrisk of criminal activity. Moreover, the dissent places great emphasis on the fact\r\nthat the prior shootings occurred two or more miles away from D & J. This fact,\r\nhowever, does not defeat or weaken Lord's position as it would take no more than\r\nfive minutes for one to travel such a short distance. Accordingly, unlike the\r\ndissent, we cannot find that D & J was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in the result reached by the majority in this\r\ncase. I write separately because, as the majority notes, I do not believe Gopal II5\r\nwrought any change in the law which requires a prospective/retrospective analysis.\r\n\r\nFurther, while I agree with the dissent that, \". . . the law does not impose upon a\r\nbusiness owner a duty to provide a security guard,\" I do not read the majority\r\nopinion to require that measure in this or any case.\r\n\r\nThe duty as correctly pointed out by both the majority and the dissent is one of\r\nreasonable care to protect invitees from unreasonable risk of harm. Whether the\r\njury would have valued Clark's opinion that a security guard was required in this\r\ncase in order to fulfill that duty poses questions of credibility and fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5   Bass v Goapl, Inc., 395 S.C. 129, 716 S.E.2d 910 (2011).\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: Today the Court holds that a merchant has a duty to\r\nprovide a security guard where random acts of criminal violence occur miles away\r\nfrom the business. Because I believe, as a matter of law, that no such duty exists, I\r\nwould affirm. It is also my judgment that a proper application of Gopal II would\r\nresult in affirming the grant of summary judgment by the able trial judge. Bass v.\r\nGopal, 395 S.C. 129, 716 S.E.2d 910 (2011). As a result, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\nRespondent operates a check cashing business, known as Cash on the Spot, on\r\nCherry Road in Rock Hill, South Carolina.6 On January 28, 2008, Phillip Watts\r\nshot an employee of the Saltwater Seafood Market during an armed robbery. The\r\nSaltwater Seafood Market is located in Rock Hill, two miles from Respondent's\r\nbusiness. Eight days later, on February 5, Watts robbed the John Boy's Valero and\r\nshot a customer and an employee. John Boy's Valero is located in Fort Mill, South\r\nCarolina, approximately eight miles from Respondent's business. Nine days later\r\non February 14, Watts shot Appellant at Respondent's business. There is no\r\nevidence of any violent crimes occurring either on or in the immediate vicinity of\r\nRespondent's business.\r\n\r\nThe majority states the \"key determination\" in this case is whether Respondent\r\n\"breached its duty to take reasonable steps to protect Lord, its business invitee,\r\nagainst foreseeable risk of physical harm.\" A business owner, of course, owes a\r\nduty of reasonable care to protect its invitees against the foreseeable risk of\r\nphysical harm, a position which Respondent has never contested. But that is not\r\nthe question before this Court. Rather, this case should be decided on the limited\r\ntheory advanced by Appellant to defeat summary judgment—that is, whether the\r\nlaw imposed a duty on Respondent's business to provide a security guard. Under\r\nthe circumstances presented, I would hold as a matter of law that no such duty\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nThe sole argument presented by Appellant to the trial court in opposition to the\r\nsummary judgment motion is found in the affidavit of a private investigator and\r\nsecurity consultant, Robert Clark, who opined that Respondent had a \"duty . . . to\r\npost a security guard at the entrance to its check cashing location on Cherry Road\r\nin Rock Hill.\" Appellant's counsel asserted at the summary judgment hearing that\r\n\"in this case . . . the duty is the duty to have a security guard.\" Appellant, to her\r\ncredit, has pursued this same limited argument on appeal. In her brief, we find the\r\nfollowing statements: \"Despite their knowledge and appreciation of the threat\r\nposed by Watts, [Respondent's] personnel did not have a security guard posted at\r\n\r\n    Numerous commercial establishments are located on Cherry Road.\r\n6\r\n\nthe entrance of the [business] location\"; the risk of harm \"weighs heavily in the\r\nbalance and justifies a requirement that [Respondent] post a security guard\"; and\r\nunder the circumstances, the law imposed on Respondent a \"duty to post a security\r\nguard until the threat by Watts had passed.\" Appellant's Br. at 3, 7, 8.\r\n\r\nAppellant's assignment of error on appeal conflates the legal question of duty with\r\nthe scintilla rule concerning factual matters in reviewing a summary judgment\r\nmotion. Appellant argues \"[t]here is a genuine issue of material fact on the\r\nquestion of whether [Respondent] owed a duty to [Appellant] to post a security\r\nguard at its business to protect her from a foreseen criminal act by [the shooter].\"\r\nAppellant's Br. at 6. The majority has accepted Appellant's invitation to apply the\r\nscintilla rule to the legal question of duty, observing that at the summary judgment\r\nposture, \"it is not the role of the circuit court or this Court to determine whether\r\n[Appellant] will prevail on her negligence claim.\" Yet, the question of duty is one\r\nfor the court. While I acknowledge the mere scintilla standard for summary\r\njudgment, \"'[a] motion for summary judgment on the basis of the absence of a duty\r\nis a question of law for the court to determine.'\" Cole v. Boy Scouts of Am., 397\r\nS.C. 247, 251, 725 S.E.2d 476, 478 (2011) (quoting Oblachinski v. Reynolds, 391\r\nS.C. 557, 560, 706 S.E.2d 844, 845 (2011)). Only when a legal duty is established\r\ndoes the issue of \"whether the defendant breached that duty [become] a question of\r\nfact.\" Id. (citing Singletary v. S.C. Dep't. of Educ., 316 S.C. 153, 157, 447 S.E.2d\r\n231, 233 (Ct. App. 1994)).\r\n\r\nAs acknowledged, Respondent owed a duty of reasonable care to its invitees, and\r\nwhether a business owner has satisfied or breached that duty is generally a fact\r\nquestion for the jury. Appellant, however, has framed the question narrowly by\r\nseeking to impose a duty on Respondent to provide a security guard. I would hold\r\nthat under the undisputed facts of this case, the law does not impose upon a\r\nbusiness owner a duty to provide a security guard.\r\n\r\nThe trial court analyzed this case under Shipes7 and Gopal II.8 In evaluating the\r\nGopal II balancing test, while the trial court found there was some evidence of\r\nforeseeability,9 it examined the sole theory of duty advanced by Appellant and\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., 269 S.C. 479, 238 S.E.2d 167 (1977).\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8Bass v. Gopal, 395 S.C. 129, 716 S.E.2d 910 (2011). I join the majority in\r\nutilizing the balancing test adopted in Gopal II.\r\n\nconcluded that the law does not impose on a business owner a duty to provide a\r\nsecurity guard under the circumstances.10 The trial court's order concludes:\r\n\r\n      In Gopal, the Supreme Court found that \"the hiring of security\r\n      personnel is [no small burden]. Considering a business's economic\r\n      interest, it is difficult to imagine an instance where a business would\r\n      be required to employ costly security guards in the absence of\r\n      evidence of prior crimes on the premises.\" The facts of this case are\r\n      no exception. There is no evidence of prior crimes on the premises of\r\n      Cash on the Spot. Therefore, if the rationale of the [Appellant] is\r\n      taken to its logical conclusion, every business in York County that\r\n      was manned by one or two people and had cash on hand had a legal\r\n      duty to hire a security guard from February 5 onward, either until the\r\n      assailant was caught or to some unknown time in the future when the\r\n      threat was no longer imminent. Imposing such a heavy burden on\r\n      small businesses, based on these facts, is both unreasonable and\r\n      economically unfeasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9  Evidence of foreseeability comes from Respondent's owner's warning to the\r\nemployees to be vigilant, because \"there [was] a madman on the loose.\" See\r\nMelton v. Boustred, 183 Cal. App. 4th 521, 538, 107 Cal. Rptr. 3d 481, 496 (6th\r\nDist. 2010) (\"[R]andom, violent crime is endemic in today's society. It is difficult,\r\nif not impossible, to envision any locale open to the public where the occurrence of\r\nviolent crime seems improbable.\" (quotation omitted)). Given the two prior\r\nrobberies and shootings occurred two or more miles away, and the complete\r\nabsence of any serious crimes on Respondent's premises, I would not use\r\nRespondent's owner's \"madman on the loose\" statement to impose a duty on the\r\nbusiness to provide a security guard.\r\n10Although not determinative in resolving this appeal, I note the employees of\r\nRespondent were separated from the customers by bulletproof glass and wore\r\npanic buttons around their neck. Moreover, prior to the robbery, Respondent's\r\nemployees attended a meeting where the policies and procedures regarding armed\r\nrobberies were discussed in order to prepare them for possible future incidents.\r\nWhether these measures were reasonable is not before us, for Appellant proceeded\r\non the sole theory that the law imposed a duty on Respondent to provide a security\r\nguard.\r\n\nThe facts of this case are tragic, the trauma and injuries to Appellant horrific. But\r\nthe question of whether the law imposes a duty on a business to provide security\r\nguards should follow the Gopal II framework, which I am convinced answers the\r\nquestion \"no\" under the facts of this case. Because I believe the trial court struck\r\nthe proper balance in evaluating the legal question of duty and correctly granted\r\nsummary judgment, I would affirm.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27377","title":"In the Matter of Charles Berger","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27377.pdf","description":"This is an opinion in which the Court imposed discipline on a lawyer.","date":"2014-04-09","type":"opinion","text":"                   THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                        In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n             In the Matter of Charles William Berger, Respondent\r\n\r\n             Appellate Case No. 2013-002535\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Opinion No. 27377 \n\r\n                 Submitted January 27, 2014 – Filed April 9, 2014 \n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DISCIPLINE IMPOSED\r\n\r\n\r\n             Lesley M.

FACTS\r\n\r\n                                     Matter I\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Mr. and Mrs. Doe, residents of South Carolina, were having difficulty\r\npaying the mortgage on their home and were facing foreclosure; the lender\r\nremoved the foreclosure action from the active roster to attempt loss mitigation or\r\nloan modification. In the spring of 2012, Mrs. Doe conducted an Internet search to\r\nlocate a lawyer and completed a form on a mortgage modification website.\r\nSeveral companies responded, including respondent's law firm, the Law Offices of\r\nC. William Berger, Esquire, which sent the Does a letter offering assistance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Doe contacted respondent's law firm for assistance in avoiding foreclosure.\r\nShe inquired about the effect of respondent being in Florida and, in reply, was told\r\n\"Yes …you will have a local attorney….\" Thereafter, the Does signed a fee\r\nagreement, paid a retainer of $1,500.00, and agreed to have the law firm withdraw\r\na monthly fee from their bank account. The Does received emails addressing how\r\nlong the matter would take and stating \"[w]e have never lost a home ...that is\r\nbecause we only take on clients that we can help …and have a valid case.\" The\r\nDoes received a \"Welcome Email\" stating the firm had contacted the Does' lender\r\nand requested the Does complete a form and send requested documents. The Does\r\ncompleted the form and sent the requested documents. Over a three month period,\r\nthe Does received the same \"Welcome Email\" on three occasions.\r\n\r\nIn August 2012, the Does received an email from their lender advising it was\r\nunable to proceed with the loss mitigation process because it had not received\r\ncertain documents and it had filed a Motion to Restore the foreclosure proceeding\r\nto the roster. Mrs. Doe contacted respondent's law firm and forwarded the lender's\r\nletter and motion by email. She was again sent the \"Welcome Email.\" After\r\nrepeated attempts to contact the law firm, Mrs. Doe was notified on August 24,\r\n2012, that the law firm had filed a response to the lender's motion. As of this time,\r\nneither of the Does had spoken with respondent or any other lawyer with his firm.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, respondent's law firm repeatedly told Mrs. Doe that a\r\n\"negotiator\" would be assigned to assist with the loan modification process. When\r\nthe negotiator contacted Mrs. Doe on August 24, 2012, the negotiator did not\r\n\nmention the lender's Motion to Restore and advised what to do \"if you are currently\r\nbehind or do fall behind on your mortgage payments.\"\r\n\r\n On August 28, 2012, Mrs. Doe spoke with the lender who requested she submit\r\nseveral of the same documents she had given to respondent's law firm. Mrs. Doe\r\ncommunicated this request to the negotiator who then requested the same\r\ndocuments that Mrs. Doe had already submitted to the law firm.\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2012, Mrs. Doe received notice that a hearing in the foreclosure\r\ncase was scheduled for October 3, 2012. Mrs. Doe notified the negotiator who\r\nresponded, \"[t]his is a hearing due to not paying on your mortgage, I am going to\r\nforward this over to the correct department and have the attorney give you a call.\"\r\nFrom September 20 until the morning of the hearing, Mrs. Doe sent at least\r\nseventeen email messages to representatives of respondent's law firm asking to\r\nspeak with her lawyer, asking for the lawyer's name, and inquiring about the\r\nhearing. She received a few responses, none of which answered her questions. At\r\none point, she received an email stating, \"[w]e are waiting to hear back from your\r\nattorney, [Lawyer A].\"2 According to the Formal Charges, Lawyer A had not been\r\nretained by respondent's firm to represent the Does.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions, an employee of the law firm told Mrs. Doe that the\r\nemployee had been consulting with a lawyer in the law firm named \"Lynn.\" Mrs.\r\nDoe was not put in touch with \"Lynn\" or given Lynn's last name or contact\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the October 3, 2012, hearing, Mrs. Doe received an email from the\r\nemployee stating \"Lynn\" had \"Fed-Ex'd\" a motion to the judge yesterday. The\r\nemail further stated \"there is a conflict with the Attorney's schedule for the hearing.\r\nHOWEVER, speaking with Lynn…it is advised that you go to the hearing and\r\nState [sic] that you have an attorney, and your case is being handled, and there was\r\na conflict with her schedule.\"\r\n\r\nCourt records indicate \"Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State Cause\r\nof Action and Improper Restablishment of the Lost Note\" was sent by Federal\r\nExpress listing the Does' name at respondent's return address. The motion was not\r\nsigned by the Does and did not list a lawyer on behalf of the Does. The motion\r\nwas improper as this was not a \"lost note\" case. Further, respondent's law firm did\r\n\r\n2 The law firm identified Lawyer A by name; Lawyer A is authorized to practice\r\nlaw in South Carolina.\r\n\nnot serve a copy of the motion on counsel for the lender. In addition, the Does\r\nwere not provided with a copy of the motion and were neither consulted nor\r\nadvised regarding its contents. At the time of the hearing, neither of the Does had\r\nspoken with respondent or any attorney at his law firm.\r\n\r\nMoments before the hearing, a representative of the law firm sent Mrs. Doe an\r\nemail with the name and telephone number for another attorney, Lawyer B,\r\nlicensed to practice law in South Carolina. Lawyer B did not appear at the hearing.\r\nRespondent's firm had not retained Lawyer B to handle the Does' case.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, Mrs. Doe informed the judge that respondent was representing she\r\nand her husband and had a scheduling conflict. Counsel for the lender stated no\r\none in her law firm had been contacted by an attorney on behalf of the Does. The\r\njudge took evidence from the lender; the judge held the matter in abeyance for\r\nthree weeks to allow Mrs. Doe the opportunity to submit documentation of active\r\nloan modification negotiations.\r\n\r\nBetween October 3 and October 18, 2012, Mrs. Doe sent at least sixteen email\r\nmessages to employees of respondent's law firm asking to speak to an attorney and\r\nrequesting the documentation requested by the judge. She was not able to speak\r\nwith a lawyer and did not receive any documentation verifying she was in active\r\nnegotiations to modify the loan. Mrs. Doe was repeatedly told that \"Lynn\" was\r\nhandling the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Does were not able to submit the required documentation to the judge. Mrs.\r\nDoe informed two of respondent's employees that a sale date was scheduled for\r\nDecember 3, 2012. In the weeks leading up to the sale, Mrs. Doe sent repeated\r\nemail messages to the law firm asking questions, requesting a lawyer, and\r\nrequesting a phone call. According to the Formal Charges, the employees\r\n\"continued to put Mrs. [Doe] off, claiming that they were waiting to hear from the\r\nlender and promising that they would postpone the sale of the property.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 14, 2012, an employee forwarded Mrs. Doe an email message from\r\na \"litigation paralegal\" containing information about the South Carolina procedures\r\nfor filing a notice of appeal copied from the Internet. The email advised the\r\ndeadline for filing an appeal was November 22, 2012. Mrs. Doe responded with\r\nquestions about the appeal process, including whether respondent's law firm would\r\nassist with the appeal. No one responded to her questions.\r\n\nOn November 20, 2012, an employee emailed Mrs. Doe and advised that she\r\ncontact the Greenville County Clerk of Court for information, \"tell them that you\r\nare filing an appeal & get more info (exactly who to make the check payable to and\r\nif there is a specific appellate form or if the notice of appeal is sufficient). If they\r\nare paying cash, that is easiest, but from what I found above it looks like it would\r\nbe payable to Greenville County Circuit Court.\" Mrs. Doe inquired about the\r\neffect an appeal would have on the sale date but did not receive a response.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Mrs. Doe contacted the lender's counsel directly. Mrs. Doe\r\nsuccessfully postponed the sale date. The Does hired a South Carolina lawyer to\r\nassist with the foreclosure and loan mediation.\r\n\r\nFrom June 2012 through February 2013, respondent continued to make monthly\r\ndrafts from the Does' bank account for attorney's fees.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter II\r\n\r\nThe Roes are residents of South Carolina. On May 27, 2011, the Roes' lender\r\nfiled a foreclosure action in Lexington County. No answer was filed and no\r\nattorney made an appearance.\r\n\r\nIn February 2012, the Roes hired respondent to represent them in the foreclosure\r\nproceeding. They signed a fee agreement, paid respondent's law firm $1,500.00,\r\nand made arrangements for the law firm to draw a monthly fee from their bank\r\naccount. In the fee agreement respondent agreed to provide the following services:\r\nanswering the complaint, amending the answer, making and amending affirmative\r\ndefenses, answering amended complaints, communicating with opposing counsel,\r\nscheduling hearings, maintaining and reviewing the client file, monitoring the\r\ncourt docket, preparing for hearings, attending hearings (in person or by phone),\r\nconducting and updating legal research, defending against motions for summary\r\njudgment, and handling pretrial motion not related to discovery. The fee\r\nagreement excluded the following services: discovery, \"trials,\" lawsuits by\r\nmortgage holders other than the first mortgage holder, transactional services, and\r\nclaims of \"affirmative\" relief.\r\n\r\n On February 21, 2012, a foreclosure hearing was held. Neither respondent nor\r\nanyone from his law firm appeared on the Roes' behalf. A default judgment was\r\nentered on February 22, 2012.\r\n\nOn June 8, 2012, the Roes filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Reinstate the\r\nLoan prepared by respondent's law firm, listing the Roes as pro se, but providing\r\nthe address for the law firm. On June 15, 2012, the court issued notice of the\r\nhearing on the Motion for Reconsideration, serving the Roes at the property\r\naddress and respondent's law firm address in Florida. The hearing was held on\r\nJune 26, 2012; no one appeared on the Roes' behalf.\r\n\r\n On July 5, 2012, the judge signed the order denying the Motion for\r\nReconsideration. On July 24, 2012, the Roes filed a notice of appeal prepared by\r\nrespondent's law firm. On July 31, 2012, the Roes filed a Motion to Stay Eviction\r\nPending Appeal prepared by respondent's law firm. On each document,\r\nrespondent's Florida address was listed below the Roes' names.\r\n\r\nThe Roes' home was sold in foreclosure. From February through July 2012,\r\nrespondent continued to make monthly drafts of $750.00 from the Roes' bank\r\naccount for attorney's fees.         Matter III\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 2012, ODC served respondent with a Notice of Investigation in\r\nthe Doe matter, advising of his obligation to respond within fifteen days pursuant\r\nto Rule 19, RLDE. No response was received. ODC sent respondent a reminder\r\nletter on December 21, 2012, pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514,\r\n290 S.E.2d 240 (1982). On February 6, 2013, ODC served respondent with a\r\nsubpoena for the Does' client file and a list of all of his South Carolina clients.\r\nRespondent did not provide the subpoenaed documents.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 2013, ODC served respondent with a Notice of Investigation in the\r\nRoe matter, advising of his obligation to respond within fifteen days pursuant to\r\nRule 19, RLDE. On the same day, ODC served respondent with a second\r\nsubpoena again asking for the Does' client file, a list of all of his South Carolina\r\nclients, and for the Roes' client file. Respondent failed to respond to the Notices of\r\nInvestigation, failed to respond to the subpoenas, and failed to appear for two\r\ninterviews scheduled pursuant to Rule 19(c)(3), RLDE.\r\n\r\nThe Formal Charges alleged respondent failed to cooperate in ODC's investigation\r\nof the two above matters by failing to respond to the Notice of Investigations, by\r\nfailing to respond to subpoenas, and by failing to appear for two interviews\r\nscheduled pursuant to Rule 19(c)(3), RLDE.\r\n\nThe Hearing Panel found respondent's conduct violated the following Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR3: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\ncompetent representation);      Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall abide by client's decisions\r\nconcerning objectives of representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with diligence\r\nand promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client\r\nreasonably informed about status of matter and promptly comply with reasonable\r\nrequests for information; lawyer shall explain matter to the extent reasonably\r\nnecessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding\r\nrepresentation); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not make agreement for, charge, or collect\r\nunreasonable fee or unreasonable amount for expenses); Rule 1.15(c) (lawyer shall\r\ndeposit into client trust account unearned legal fees and expenses that have been\r\npaid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses\r\nincurred); Rule 3.1 (lawyer shall not bring or defend proceeding, or assert or\r\ncontrovert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that\r\nis not frivolous); Rule 3.5(b) (lawyer shall not communicate ex parte with judge\r\nduring proceeding unless authorized to do so by law or court order); Rule 5.3\r\n(lawyer who individually or together with other lawyers possesses comparable\r\nmanagerial authority in law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the\r\nfirm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that non-lawyer\r\nemployee's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer);\r\nRule 5.5(a) (lawyer shall not practice law in jurisdiction in violation of the\r\nregulation of legal profession in jurisdiction or assist another in doing so); Rule\r\n5.5(b) (lawyer not admitted in this jurisdiction shall not hold out to public or\r\notherwise represent lawyer is admitted to practice in this jurisdiction); and Rule\r\n8.1(b) (in connection with disciplinary matter, lawyer shall not knowingly fail to\r\nrespond to a lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority).\r\n\r\n                                   DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nAs noted above, since respondent failed to answer the Formal Charges, he is\r\ndeemed to have admitted the allegations in the charges. Rule 24(a), RLDE.\r\nFurther, since he failed to appear for the Panel Hearing, respondent is deemed to\r\nhave admitted the factual allegations and to have conceded the merits of any\r\nrecommendations considered at the Panel Hearing. Rule 24(b), RLDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n3  The Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, are applicable as\r\nrespondent's misconduct occurred in connection with matters pending before\r\ntribunals in South Carolina. See Rule 8.5(b), RPC (addressing choice of law for\r\ndisciplinary matters).\r\n\nPursuant to Rule 3(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, the Commission on Lawyer\r\nConduct (the Commission) has jurisdiction over all allegations that a lawyer has\r\ncommitted misconduct. \"Lawyer\" is defined as \"a lawyer not admitted in this\r\njurisdiction if the lawyer provides or offers to provide any legal services in this\r\njurisdiction.\" Rule 2(q), RLDE. Accordingly, even though he is not admitted to\r\npractice law in South Carolina, respondent is subject to discipline in this state.\r\n\r\nThe authority to discipline lawyers and the manner in which the discipline is\r\nimposed is a matter within the Court's discretion. In the Matter of Van Son, 403\r\nS.C. 170, 742 S.E.2d 660 (2013). When the lawyer is in default the Court need\r\nonly determine the appropriate sanction. Id.\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct particularly egregious. Although not admitted to\r\npractice law in South Carolina, respondent nevertheless engaged in the practice of\r\nlaw in this state. He represented clients in South Carolina. He or his firm provided\r\nadvice to clients and prepared and filed pleadings, some of which were frivolous,\r\non behalf of his clients. Although he prepared and filed motions, respondent\r\nneglected to attend the motion hearings.        Moreover, respondent charged and\r\ncollected unreasonable fees from clients for the minimal work he did perform and\r\nthen continued to collect fees from clients even after his representation ceased.\r\nWhen disciplinary charges were filed against him, respondent ignored the matter\r\nby failing to respond, participate in the investigative process, or appear for the\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nIn considering the appropriate sanction, we find several aggravating factors\r\napplicable. First, respondent undertook the representation of vulnerable clients,\r\nindividuals who had financial difficulties and faced the prospects of losing their\r\nhomes to foreclosure. In the Matter of Samaha, 399 S.C. 2, 731 S.E.2d 277\r\n(2012); In the Matter of Dickey, 395 S.C. 336, 718 S.E. 2d 739 (2011). Second,\r\nrespondent failed to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation and to appear for\r\nthe hearing. In the Matter of Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998)\r\n(\"An attorney's failure to answer charges or appear to defend or explain alleged\r\nmisconduct indicates an obvious disinterest in the practice of law. Such an\r\nattorney is likely to face the most severe sanctions because a central purpose of the\r\ndisciplinary process is to protect the public from unscrupulous or indifferent\r\nlawyers.\"). Third, as recognized in the Panel Report, respondent received a public\r\nreprimand from the Supreme Court of Florida in 2003. By the reprimand, the\r\nFlorida Supreme Court sanctioned respondent for failing to provide competent\r\nrepresentation, failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\r\nrepresenting a client, and failing to explain a matter to the extent reasonably\r\n\nnecessary to permit a client to make informed decisions regarding representation.\r\nRespondent has committed the same misconduct in the current matter.\r\n\r\nIf respondent were admitted to practice law in South Carolina, his conduct would\r\nwarrant disbarment. Since he is not admitted in South Carolina, we find it\r\nappropriate to permanently debar him from seeking any form of admission to\r\npractice law in this state (including pro hac vice admission) without first obtaining\r\nan order from this Court allowing him to seek admission. We        further      order\r\nrespondent to fully reimburse all fees and costs paid by the clients in this matter\r\nand to pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by\r\nODC and the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion.\r\n\r\nShould he wish to seek admission in the future, the burden of proof shall be on\r\nrespondent to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he is of sufficient\r\ncharacter and fitness. Under no circumstances shall respondent be eligible to seek\r\nadmission until he has fully reimbursed his clients for all fees and costs paid in this\r\nmatter and paid the costs of this proceeding.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE IMPOSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27378","title":"In the Matter of Amelia Lorenz","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27378.pdf","description":"This opinion disbars Amelia H.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara\r\n            M. Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both for\r\n            Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n            Amelia Holt Lorenz, Pro Se.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nany period of definite suspension or to disbarment. Respondent requests that the\r\nsanction be made retroactive to November 1, 2012. We accept the Agreement and\r\ndisbar respondent from the practice of law in this state, retroactive to the date of\r\ninterim suspension. In the Agreement, respondent acknowledges being in default\r\non the formal charges. She admits the material portions of the factual allegations\r\nand the allegations of rule violations set forth in the formal charges as follows.\r\n\r\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 2012, respondent conducted a real estate closing on behalf of a client\r\nbut did not pay off the client's mortgage or record the deed in a timely manner.\r\nSometime shortly after the closing, respondent closed her practice and moved to\r\nGeorgia. She did not provide her title insurance company with her new contact\r\n\ninformation, nor did she update her contact information with the South Carolina\r\nBar or in the Attorney Information System.\r\n\r\nBy September 2012, respondent owed the title insurance company approximately\r\n$4,533.24 in title insurance premiums on approximately twenty-five closings. The\r\ntitle company incurred $200 in fees to retain a law firm to conduct title searches.\r\n\r\nRespondent did not respond to the notice of investigation, a subpoena for the files\r\nand financial records from the closing discussed above, or any correspondence\r\nfrom ODC, and failed to appear for two interviews. ODC's review of trust account\r\nrecords obtained from the bank revealed counter withdrawals and miscellaneous\r\ndebits. Without respondent's accounting records or her cooperation in the\r\ninvestigation, ODC has no explanation for the transactions and no way to\r\ndetermine whether funds from respondent's closings were disbursed appropriately\r\nor in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nAs noted, respondent was placed on interim suspension on November 1, 2012, but\r\nshe has not filed the affidavit required by Rule 30(g), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR,\r\nnor has she delivered her files or otherwise cooperated with the attorney appointed\r\nto protect her clients' interests.      Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by her conduct she has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall\r\nprovide competent representation to a client, which requires the legal knowledge,\r\nskill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation);\r\nRule 1.2 (a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of\r\nrepresentation and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to\r\nbe pursued); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness\r\nin representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall communicate with the client);\r\nRule 1.15(d) (upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third\r\nperson has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person and\r\nshall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that\r\nthe client or third person is entitled to ); Rule 1.16 (requirements when terminating\r\nrepresentation); and Rule 8.1 (a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter\r\nshall not fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary\r\nauthority).\r\n\nRespondent also admits she has violated the following provisions of the Rules for\r\nLawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(it shall be a\r\nground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or\r\nany other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers); Rule\r\n7(a)(3)(it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to willfully violate a valid\r\norder of the Supreme Court, Commission or panels of the Commission in a\r\nproceeding under these rules, willfully fail to appear personally as directed,\r\nwillfully fail to comply with a subpoena issued under these rules, or knowingly fail\r\nto respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority to include a request for\r\na response or appearance under Rule 19(b)(1), (c)(3) or (c)(4)); Rule 7(a)(5)(it\r\nshall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute\r\nthe administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\ndisrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); Rule 7(a)(6)(it\r\nshall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the oath of office taken to\r\npractice law in this state); and Rule 7(a)(7)(it shall be a ground for discipline for a\r\nlawyer to willfully violate a valid court order issued by a court of this state).\r\nFinally, respondent admits she has violated Rule 410, SCACR, by failing to update\r\nher contact information with the Bar and in AIS, and Rule 417, SCACR, by failing\r\nto follow financial recordkeeping requirements.\r\n\r\nRespondent has agreed to pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of\r\nthis matter by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct within ninety days of\r\nthe imposition of discipline.        Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from\r\nthe practice of law in this state, retroactive to the date of interim suspension.\r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\naffidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30 of\r\nRule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender her Certificate of Admission to the\r\nPractice of Law to the Clerk of Court. Within ninety days of the date of this\r\nopinion, respondent shall, as set forth in the Agreement, pay the costs incurred in\r\nthe investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission on\r\nLawyer Conduct.\r\n\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27379","title":"Kerr v.

We\r\naffirm.\r\n\n      The facts, in the light most favorable to Appellants, are as follows.1\r\nSkywaves I Corporation (Skywaves) is a South Carolina corporation that develops\r\ntechnology for the wireless telecommunications industry. In 2005, Skywaves\r\nentered into a factoring agreement with BB&T. From 2005 to 2007, Skywaves and\r\nBB&T occasionally amended the factoring agreement via written modifications so\r\nthat BB&T could fund Skywaves's working capital needs as those needs developed\r\nand expanded.\r\n\r\n      In early 2007, Skywaves won several lucrative government contracts, and its\r\nBoard of Directors determined that the company required more capital than BB&T\r\nprovided at that time in order to meet the increased demand for their products.\r\nSkywaves therefore solicited funding proposals from various entities, including\r\nWachovia, Hunt Capital, and BB&T.\r\n\r\n       In March 2007, Edahl, an employee at BB&T's branch located in Charleston,\r\nheld a meeting for Skywaves and its current investors, informing them:\r\n\r\n      that [BB&T] understood the short and long term capital needs of\r\n      Skywaves; that Skywaves did not need a large bank or additional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We note that the trial court and both parties continuously referred to the motions\r\nat issue as \"motions to dismiss.\" However, Appellants provided materials outside\r\nthe pleadings to the trial court—specifically, the new factoring agreement and\r\ncorrespondence between BB&T and Skywaves—and the court relied on those\r\nmaterials in making its decision to dismiss Appellants' claims, thereby converting\r\nRespondents' motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment. See Rule\r\n12(b), SCRCP.\r\n      When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, appellate courts apply the\r\nsame standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP, including\r\nviewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\r\nthe non-moving party. Turner v. Milliman, 392 S.C. 116, 121–22, 708 S.E.2d 766,\r\n769 (2011); Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493–94, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).\r\n\"Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Lanham v. Blue\r\nCross & Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).\r\n\n      capital funding to continue its growth; that [Respondents] believed\r\n      Skywaves was strategically positioned for success; that [Respondents]\r\n      wanted to take Skywaves to a sale or stock IPO; and that BB&T\r\n      would fund all the company's financial needs.\r\n\r\n      Following this presentation, Skywaves decided to obtain the needed funding\r\nfrom BB&T. Skywaves therefore entered into a new and expanded factoring\r\nagreement, which provided for, among other things, financing based on accounts\r\nreceivable, invoices, purchase orders, contracts, and site plans. The parties\r\nintended the new factoring agreement to obligate BB&T to advance the costs of\r\nSkywaves's expanded manufacturing.\r\n\r\n       Several months later, in July 2007, Edahl made a presentation to Appellants,\r\neach of whom was a director, officer, or shareholder in Skywaves, in addition to a\r\ncurrent or potential investor in Skywaves. During the presentation, Edahl told\r\nAppellants that BB&T believed that Skywaves would continue to develop and\r\nexpand into new markets, that BB&T \"was fully committed to providing all of\r\nSkywaves['s] short-term and long-term financial needs for growth,\" and that\r\nBB&T would honor the new factoring agreement between itself and Skywaves.\r\nAppellants alleged that they each relied on these statements and were induced to\r\n\"invest[] in the growth\" of Skywaves via purchasing equity positions and making\r\nloans to Skywaves.\r\n\r\n      BB&T funded Skywaves in accordance with the new factoring agreement\r\nfrom March 2007 until January 2008. In January 2008, BB&T asserted that\r\nSkywaves had defaulted under the terms of the factoring agreement, and BB&T\r\nrefused to honor any further financial commitments in accordance with the\r\ncontract. In the absence of funding, Skywaves filed for bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n       As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, Appellants lost their equity\r\ninvestments in Skywaves. Skywaves and Appellants therefore filed separate\r\nlawsuits against Respondents—Skywaves on its own behalf, and Appellants in\r\ntheir capacity as investors and employees of Skywaves.2 Appellants asserted\r\nclaims for negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, and\r\nviolations of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (the SCUTPA).3\r\n\r\n2 The action initiated by Skywaves to allocate fault for BB&T's alleged breach of\r\nthe new factoring agreement is not a part of this appeal.\r\n3Appellants did not appeal the trial court's dismissal of the SCUTPA claims.\r\nTherefore, the trial court's findings regarding the SCUTPA claims are the law of\r\n\nArguing that their claims were entirely separate from the claims Skywaves asserted\r\nagainst BB&T, Appellants asserted that the alleged misrepresentations made by\r\nEdahl during the July 2007 presentation were torts committed against them directly\r\nand that they did not file their actions to enforce the new factoring agreement\r\nbetween Skywaves and BB&T. Appellants requested Respondents pay actual\r\ndamages in the amount of Appellants' lost investments.4\r\n\r\n      Respondents filed motions to dismiss in each action. Appellants opposed\r\nthe motions to dismiss and attached copies of the factoring agreement and\r\ncorrespondence between BB&T and Skywaves in support of their motions.\r\n\r\n       The trial court granted the motions to dismiss, finding all of Appellants'\r\nclaims were barred for various reasons.5 Appellants appealed all four cases and\r\nmoved to consolidate the matters, claiming that they had stated cognizable claims\r\nfor negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent inducement based on\r\nthe statements made by Edahl at the July 2007 presentation. This Court certified\r\nthe appeal from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe case, and we will not further address those claims. See In re Morrison, 321\r\nS.C. 370, 372 n.2, 468 S.E.2d 651, 652 n.2 (1996) (explaining that an unappealed\r\nruling becomes the law of the case, precluding consideration of the issue on\r\nappeal).\r\n4Additionally, Appellants Voytko (Skywaves's CFO) and Konersmann\r\n(Skywaves's CEO) claimed Respondents were responsible for $37,048.13 and\r\n$870,000.00, respectively, in lost salary and unreimbursed expenses.\r\n5In dismissing Appellants' claims, the trial court relied in part on section 37-10-\r\n107 (the lender statute of frauds). However, section 37-10-107 only applies to\r\nsuits between lenders and borrowers, such as that between Skywaves and BB&T,\r\nand it therefore is irrelevant here. See S.C. Code Ann. § 37-10-107 (2002 & Supp.\r\n2010); John L. Culhane, Jr., & Dean C. Gramlich, Lender Liability Limitation\r\nAmendments to State Statutes of Frauds, 45 Bus. Law. 1779, 1780, 1792 (1990)\r\n(discussing the purpose of the Model Lender Liability Statute, of which South\r\nCarolina's lender statute of frauds is a word-for-word reproduction); cf. Sea Cove\r\nDev., L.L.C. v. Harbourside Cmty. Bank, 387 S.C. 95, 98, 691 S.E.2d 158, 159\r\n(2010) (stating that the lender statute of frauds \"prohibits certain legal and\r\nequitable actions arising out of the loan of money where there is no writing\r\nevidencing the parties' alleged agreement\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\n       Despite Appellants' attempt to frame their claims as alleged\r\nmisrepresentations made to them in their capacity as investors, the trial court aptly\r\nnoted that, at its core, this case revolves around the contractual relationship\r\nbetween BB&T and its customer, Skywaves. That relationship is the subject of the\r\nsuit between Skywaves and BB&T, which is not before us. Rather, our inquiry\r\nhere is confined to whether these plaintiffs—as investors, directors, officers, and\r\nshareholders of Skywaves—may maintain a lawsuit separate from the one brought\r\nby the company itself, for what amounts to breach of the contract between\r\nSkywaves and BB&T. We find there is no basis in the law for a finding that\r\nBB&T owed any duty to Appellants, as non-customer investors, sufficient to\r\nsupport their claims for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, or fraudulent\r\ninducement.6\r\n\r\n       It is well-established that banks owe a limited duty of care to their\r\ncustomers. See, e.g., Burwell v. S.C. Nat'l Bank, 288 S.C. 34, 40, 340 S.E.2d 786,\r\n790 (1986) (finding that a bank-customer relationship is merely a lender-borrower\r\nrelationship and is not fiduciary in nature unless the bank undertakes to advise its\r\ncustomers as part of the services that the bank offers); Regions Bank v. Schmauch,\r\n354 S.C. 648, 671, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444 (Ct. App. 2003) (explaining that, if the\r\nbank does create a fiduciary relationship with its customer, the bank must only\r\n\"disclose material facts that may affect its customer's interests\"). We find no\r\nreason to extend a bank's limited duty to non-customers under these facts, where\r\nthe non-customers' claims are premised on disputed contractual obligations\r\nbetween a bank and its customer, but the non-customer is not an intended third-\r\nparty beneficiary to that contract.7 Cf. Florentine Corp. v. PEDA I, Inc., 287 S.C.\r\n382, 386, 339 S.E.2d 112, 114 (1985) (\"Where there is no confidential or fiduciary\r\n\r\n\r\n6 See Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002) (stating that\r\nduty is one element of a negligence claim); cf. Turner, 392 S.C. at 122–23, 708\r\nS.E.2d at 769 (explaining that, to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation or\r\nfraudulent inducement, a party must establish, inter alia, that he had a right to rely\r\non a statement made by the opposing party).\r\n7Thus, despite Appellants' assertions to the contrary, the choice of law provision\r\nfound in the factoring agreement and selecting North Carolina law is irrelevant as\r\nAppellants are neither parties nor intended third-party beneficiaries to the contract.\r\nSee Goode v. St. Stephens United Methodist Church, 329 S.C. 433, 445, 494\r\nS.E.2d 827, 833 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\nrelationship and an arm's length transaction between mature, educated people is\r\ninvolved, there is no right to rely[, and the party has not stated a claim for\r\nnegligent misrepresentation or fraudulent inducement]. This is especially true in\r\ncircumstances where one should have utilized precaution and protection to\r\nsafeguard his interests.\" (citing Thomas v. Am. Workmen, 197 S.C. 178, 182–83, 14\r\nS.E.2d 886, 887–88 (1941))).8\r\n\r\n        Thus, we conclude that while Skywaves may be able to show that, as a\r\nBB&T customer, the bank owed the corporation a duty, Appellants are not BB&T's\r\ncustomers and therefore are not owed a similar duty. Accordingly, we affirm the\r\ntrial court's ruling that Respondents were entitled to judgment as a matter of law as\r\nto all of Appellants' claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     PLEICONES, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.

We\r\nreverse.               FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n        On February 22, 2009, Appellant began experiencing headaches and\r\nbecame unable to maintain her balance. Appellant's daughter believed Appellant\r\nwas having a stroke and called an ambulance, which drove Appellant to the\r\nHospital. Appellant's daughter informed the Hospital staff of Appellant's\r\nsymptoms, including the instability and possible symptoms of a stroke. The\r\nHospital admitted Appellant to the emergency room, but left her unattended and\r\nunmonitored. Further, the Hospital prevented Appellant's family members from\r\naccompanying her into the emergency room area. At some point after being\r\nadmitted but prior to receiving treatment, Appellant attempted to use the restroom\r\nand fell, fracturing her right foot.\r\n\r\n       Appellant filed a complaint against the Hospital on February 18, 2011, and\r\nan amended complaint on May 9, 2011, alleging in both that she would not have\r\nsuffered her injuries \"had the [Hospital's] staff performed their duties in\r\ncompliance with the Hospital Policies.\" She specifically claimed that the Hospital\r\nwas negligent in \"failing to keep a watchful eye on a person who had originally\r\ncomplained of dizziness, headaches and instability, which were the precursors of\r\nher admittance\" and in \"failing to take any precautionary actions, by any means, to\r\ninsure [Appellant's] safety.\"\r\n\r\n      The Hospital moved to dismiss Appellant's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6),\r\nSCRCP. In support of its motion, the Hospital asserted that Appellant's claim\r\nalleged \"medical malpractice,\" as defined by S.C. Code Ann. § 15-79-110(6)\r\n(Supp. 2012); further, it argued that \"[p]atient assessments, fall risk precautions\r\nbased on those assessments, and ensuring patient safety based on knowledge of\r\nmedications and their side effects are all aspects of skilled and technical medical\r\ntreatment rising above the knowledge of laypersons.\" Accordingly, because the\r\nHospital viewed Appellant's claim as one sounding in medical malpractice, it\r\nargued that Appellant was required to comply with the NOI and expert affidavit\r\nrequirements found in section 15-79-125.1 See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-79-125(A)\r\n1 Appellant does not dispute that she failed to comply with the requirements of\r\nsection 15-79-125; rather, she contends that her claim does not involve \"medical\r\nmalpractice,\" and, as such, the requirements in section 15-79-125 do not apply to\r\nher claim.\r\n\n(Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n      The trial court granted the Hospital's motion to dismiss, holding that\r\nAppellant's claim fell within the broad definition of \"medical malpractice\" found in\r\nsection 15-79-110(6) and that:\r\n\r\n      Any obligation or duty owed to [Appellant] as a result of [Appellant's]\r\n      initial medical complaints and the disclosure of her current\r\n      medications to the intake nurses could arise only from a professional\r\n      medical analysis or diagnosis. It is axiomatic that any such medical\r\n      analysis or diagnosis would constitute the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe trial court therefore found that Appellant's claim triggered the NOI and expert\r\naffidavit requirements found in section 15-79-125. Because Appellant did not\r\ncomply with those requirements, the trial court dismissed her action.\r\n\r\n       Appellant moved for reconsideration, claiming that, inter alia, her claim was\r\na negligence claim based on premises liability, and that she was a business invitee\r\nto the Hospital. However, the trial court denied Appellant's motion, stating:\r\n\r\n      The premise of [Appellant's] allegations is based on an event that\r\n      happened in a medical facility due to a medical condition. Any duty in\r\n      this case arose from the fact that [Appellant] was seeking medical\r\n      treatment at a medical facility. Had the events alleged to have\r\n      occurred at the hospital taken place at a restaurant, grocery store, or\r\n      any other place of business, none would be liable based on the\r\n      allegations in the amended complaint. Therefore, this is not a premises\r\n      liability case, as there is no allegation that any dangerous conditions at\r\n      the hospital caused [Appellant] to fall.\r\n\r\n      Appellant appealed, and this Court certified the appeal from the court of\r\nappeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.ISSUE\r\n      Whether Appellant's cause of action sounds in medical malpractice or\r\n      ordinary negligence?    STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       On appeal from a dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the appellate\r\ncourt applies the same standard of review as the trial court—whether the defendant\r\n\ndemonstrates the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of\r\naction in the pleadings filed with the court. Grimsley v. S.C. Law Enforcement\r\nDiv., 396 S.C. 276, 281, 721 S.E.2d 423, 426 (2012); Flateau v. Harrelson, 355\r\nS.C. 197, 201–03, 584 S.E.2d 413, 415–16 (Ct. App. 2003). The Court is required\r\nto view the allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff\r\nand determine whether the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible\r\nfrom the pleadings would entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory of the case.\r\nGrimsley, 396 S.C. at 281, 721 S.E.2d at 426. The Court may sustain the dismissal\r\nwhen \"the facts alleged in the complaint do not support relief under any theory of\r\nlaw.\" Flateau, 355 S.C. at 202, 584 S.E.2d at 416.\r\n\r\n                                      ANALYSIS\r\n      We begin our analysis by acknowledging that \"[b]ecause medical\r\nmalpractice is a category of negligence, the distinction between medical\r\nmalpractice and negligence claims is subtle; there is no rigid analytical line\r\nseparating the two causes of action.\" Estate of French v. Stratford House, 333\r\nS.W.3d 546, 555 (Tenn. 2011). Rather, differentiating between the two types of\r\nclaims \"depends heavily on the facts of each individual case.\" Id. at 556.\r\n\r\n       In medical malpractice actions, expert testimony is required to establish both\r\nthe duty owed to the patient and the breach of that duty, unless the subject matter\r\nof the claim falls within a layman's common knowledge or experience. Linog v.\r\nYampolsky, 376 S.C. 182, 187, 656 S.E.2d 355, 358 (2008) (citing David v.\r\nMcLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 248, 626 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2006)); Bonaparte v.\r\nFloyd, 291 S.C. 427, 434, 354 S.E.2d 40, 45 (Ct. App. 1987). Because medical\r\nknowledge is generally outside of a juror's common knowledge, the requisite\r\nexpert testimony assists the jury in making a more accurate determination of fault\r\nregarding whether a physician's negligence in rendering medical care proximately\r\ncaused the patient's injury.\r\n\r\n       However, not every injury sustained by a patient in a hospital results from\r\nmedical malpractice or requires expert testimony to establish the claim. Accord\r\nBlom v. Adventist Health Sys./Sunbelt, Inc., 911 So. 2d 211, 214 (Fla. Dist. Ct.\r\nApp. 2005); Kolanowski v. Ill. Valley Cmty. Hosp., 544 N.E.2d 821, 823 (Ill. App.\r\nCt. 1989). For example, claims against a hospital for injuries caused by falling\r\nceiling tiles or improperly maintained hallways or parking lots sound in ordinary\r\nnegligence, and specifically in premises liability. See, e.g., Hughes v. Children's\r\nClinic, P.A., 269 S.C. 389, 237 S.E.2d 753 (1977); see also, e.g., Feifer v. Galen of\r\nFla., Inc., 685 So. 2d 882 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996). The plaintiff in ordinary\r\nnegligence cases does not need to produce expert testimony to establish his claim\r\n\nbecause the jurors can easily understand and evaluate the relevant facts and law\r\nmerely by exercising their common knowledge.\r\n\r\n       Thus, many states' courts distinguish between medical malpractice and\r\nordinary negligence actions by determining whether expert testimony is necessary\r\nto aid the jury's determination of fault, particularly with respect to the \"duty\" and\r\n\"causation\" elements of the claim. In general, if the patient receives allegedly\r\nnegligent professional medical care, then expert testimony as to the standard of that\r\ntype of care is necessary, and the action sounds in medical malpractice. Kujawski\r\nv. Arbor View Health Care Ctr., 407 N.W.2d 249, 252 (Wis. 1987) (quoting\r\nCramer v. Theda Clark Mem'l Hosp., 172 N.W.2d 427, 428 (Wis. 1969)).\r\nHowever, if the patient instead receives \"nonmedical, administrative, ministerial,\r\nor routine care,\" expert testimony establishing the standard of care is not required,\r\nand the action instead sounds in ordinary negligence. Id.; accord Kastler v. Iowa\r\nMethodist Hosp., 193 N.W.2d 98, 101 (Iowa 1971); Bryant v. Oakpointe Villa\r\nNursing Ctr., Inc., 684 N.W.2d 864, 871 (Mich. 2004); Estate of French, 333\r\nS.W.3d at 556 n.9, 557 n.10, 559–60 (collecting cases).\r\n\r\n       Thus, we emphasize that not every action taken by a medical professional in\r\na hospital or doctor's office necessarily implicates medical malpractice and,\r\nconsequently, the requirements of section 15-79-125. While providing medical\r\nservices to a patient, the medical professional acts in his professional capacity and\r\nmust meet the professional standard of care, as established by expert testimony.\r\nHowever, at all times, the medical professional must \"exercise ordinary and\r\nreasonable care to insure that no unnecessary harm [befalls] the patient.\" Papa v.\r\nBrunswick Gen. Hosp., 517 N.Y.S.2d 762, 763–64 (App. Div. 1987). The\r\nstatutory definition of medical malpractice found in section 15-79-110(6) does not\r\nimpact medical providers' ordinary obligation to reasonably care for patients with\r\nrespect to nonmedical, administrative, ministerial, or routine care. Thus, medical\r\nproviders are still subject to claims sounding in ordinary negligence.2\r\n\r\n\r\n2 See, e.g., Lakeland Reg'l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Allen, 944 So. 2d 541 (Fla. Dist. Ct.\r\nApp. 2006) (finding that a patient's claim against a hospital sounded in ordinary\r\nnegligence when the hospital served the patient a turkey sandwich infected with\r\nsalmonella); Estate of Swift v. Ne. Hosp. of Phila., 690 A.2d 719 (Pa. Super. Ct.\r\n1997) (finding that a patient's slip-and-fall claim against a hospital sounded in\r\nordinary negligence when the patient slipped in a puddle of water in the hospital\r\nrestroom); cf. Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984) (involving\r\na premises liability case brought by an ophthalmologist's patient who was given\r\n\n       Here, we find that Appellant's claim sounds in ordinary negligence and is\r\nnot subject to the statutory requirements associated with a medical malpractice\r\nclaim. Appellant's complaint makes clear that she had not begun receiving medical\r\ncare at the time of her injury, nor does it allege the Hospital's employees\r\nnegligently administered medical care. Rather, the complaint states that\r\nAppellant's injury occurred when she attempted to use the restroom unsupervised,\r\nprior to receiving medical care. Cf. Kastler, 193 N.W.2d at 101–02 (finding that\r\nclaims brought by an epileptic patient who fell in the shower while unattended\r\nduring a hospital stay involved routine care, not medical care, and thus sounded in\r\nordinary negligence); Landes v. Women's Christian Ass'n, 504 N.W.2d 139, 141\r\n(Iowa Ct. App. 1993) (finding claims brought by patient who had just undergone\r\nknee surgery and who fell while unattended in the restroom sounded in ordinary\r\nnegligence because they involved routine, nonmedical care).3 Accordingly, the\r\ncircuit court improperly classified Appellant's claim as one sounding in medical\r\nmalpractice, and its dismissal of her action for failing to comply with the medical\r\nmalpractice pre-filing requirements found in section 15-79-125 was in error.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed and\r\nremanded for further action consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\neye drops and left unsupervised in the waiting room, where she subsequently\r\nattempted to stand and instead fell and injured herself).\r\n3 Likewise, once the Hospital admitted Appellant, it was on notice that she was in a\r\nvulnerable physical state and undertook a duty to reasonably care for her.

Moreover, it\r\nprevented her family members from accompanying her to the emergency room\r\narea, thus likewise preventing them from assisting her. Cf. Russell v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n                        FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Petitioner was injured in a car accident on March 31, 2006, while riding as a\r\npassenger in a vehicle driven by a co-employee. The liability limits of the at-fault\r\ndriver were tendered, and there was no underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage on\r\nthe vehicle in which he was riding. Therefore, Petitioner submitted a claim for\r\nUIM benefits under a Progressive insurance policy, issued to Sarah K. Severn,\r\neffective from November 4, 2005, until May 4, 2006 (the Policy). At the time of\r\nthe accident, Petitioner resided with Severn and their child. He described Severn\r\nas \"his on again off again fiancé.\"\r\n\r\n      Both Petitioner's and Severn's names appear on the Declarations Page of the\r\nPolicy under the heading \"Drivers and household residents.\" (Emphasis removed).\r\nUnder the heading \"Additional information,\" Severn is listed as the \"Named\r\ninsured.\"\r\n\r\n      The Policy generally defines \"You\" and \"Your\" to mean:\r\n\r\n             a.\t a person or persons shown as a named insured on the\r\n                 Declarations Page; and\r\n\n             b. the spouse of a named insured if residing in the same\r\n                household.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis removed). A \"Relative\" is defined as \"a person residing in the same\r\nhousehold as you, and related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption . . . .\"\r\n(Emphasis removed).\r\n\r\n      Under Part I, entitled \"Liability to Others,\" the Policy sets forth the\r\nfollowing Insuring Agreement:\r\n\r\n      Subject to the Limit of Liability, if you pay the premium for liability\r\n      coverage, we will pay damages for bodily injury and property damage\r\n      for which an insured person becomes legally responsible because of\r\n      an accident arising out of the:\r\n\r\n             1. ownership, maintenance, or use of a vehicle . . . .\r\n\r\n(Emphasis removed). Part I defines an \"insured person\" or \"insured persons\" as,\r\ninter alia, \"you or a relative with respect to an accident arising out of the\r\nownership, maintenance, or use of a covered vehicle\" and \"any person with respect\r\nto an accident arising out of that person's use of a covered vehicle with the express\r\nor implied permission of you or a relative.\" (Emphasis removed).\r\n\r\n       Part III of the Policy, which outlines the availability of UIM coverage, states\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n      Subject to the Limits of Liability, if you pay the premium for [UIM]\r\n      Coverage, we will pay for damages which an insured person is legally\r\n      entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an underinsured\r\n      motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by an insured person\r\n      or due to property damage:\r\n\r\n             1. caused by an accident; and\r\n\r\n             2. arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of\r\n                an underinsured motor vehicle.\r\n\n(Emphasis removed). Part III of the Policy further states that \"Insured person\" and\r\n\"insured persons\" mean, inter alia, \"you or a relative.\" (Emphasis removed).\r\n\r\n      Progressive denied UIM coverage to Petitioner under Part III of the Policy.\r\nAccording to the affidavit filed by Progressive's Claims Injury Operations\r\nManager, \"[t]he claim was denied because [Petitioner] did not fall within the terms,\r\nprovisions and conditions of [the Policy] to qualify for benefits under the [UIM]\r\nprovisions,\" as Petitioner \"was only listed as a 'driver' on the policy and not a\r\nnamed insured, nor was he a resident relative of the named insured.\"\r\n\r\n       On September 24, 2007, Petitioner sought a declaratory judgment that he\r\nwas entitled to UIM coverage under the Policy and filed complaint averring causes\r\nof action for bad faith and failure to pay benefits. Progressive answered and\r\nsubsequently filed a motion for summary judgment.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court held a hearing on the summary judgment motion on\r\nOctober 13, 2008. Petitioner argued that he was listed as a driver and household\r\nresident on the Declarations Page of the Policy, and Progressive was aware that he\r\nand Severn resided together when he signed up for coverage. Petitioner presented\r\nthe following questions to the circuit court: (1) whether a \"household resident\" is\r\nalso a \"named insured\" under the Policy language; (2) whether the Policy was\r\nambiguous; and (3) whether Petitioner was a \"relative\" of Severn for purposes of\r\ncoverage. Finally, Petitioner also argued he was entitled to coverage under the\r\nPolicy by virtue of the doctrine of reasonable expectations. Progressive argued\r\nthat because Petitioner was neither the named insured nor related to the named\r\ninsured by blood or marriage, he could not recover UIM benefits under the Policy.\r\nMoreover, Progressive argued that Petitioner was not Severn's common-law\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n       During the hearing, Progressive submitted a deposition transcript to support\r\nits motion for summary judgment. In the transcript, Petitioner stated he and Severn\r\nwere engaged but \"hadn't set a date yet.\" He explained he proposed to Severn\r\nwhen she was pregnant with their son. To the question of whether they had taken\r\nany steps to be married, Petitioner responded, \"Verbal agreement and a ring . . . .\r\nShe's a procrastinator and she didn't—I mean, I didn't think—I mean, the girl\r\nsupposed [sic] to marry me, she's supposed to be on that, I thought, and so she\r\ndidn't want to do it so it just progressively got longer.\" Petitioner stated that they\r\ndiscussed marriage often but Severn never went through with it. In April 2008,\r\n\nwell after the accident, Petitioner stated he and Severn ended their engagement,\r\nand Petitioner stated he had no intention of entering a relationship with Severn\r\nagain.1Petitioner stated he paid all of the bills for water, sewer, rent, electricity,\r\nclothing, food, and the Internet. At some point while they resided together,\r\nPetitioner relinquished his car insurance through Nationwide and became an\r\nadditional driver on the Policy:\r\n\r\n        Well, we was [sic] saving money and stuff so I took—that was\r\n        insured through Nationwide and I took the insurance off of it so we\r\n        wouldn't have two insurance bills, so [Severn] made me an additional\r\n        driver on [the Policy] and I drove her car and we just shared that car.\r\n        She'd drive me to work and I'd drive her to work and . . . I'd use [the\r\n        car] on the weekend and I drove it all over.\r\n\r\nPetitioner stated further that he \"called [Progressive] on the phone\" because he\r\n\"had all [Severn's] personal information, my soon-to-be wife,\" and he \"wasn't\r\ndriving around Myrtle Beach with [his] name not being on her insurance\" because\r\nhe feared he would be arrested for driving without insurance. Petitioner stated,\r\n\r\n        I called, gave [Progressive's employee] all my information. They put\r\n        me down as an additional driver and they told me the premium, how\r\n        much difference the bill was going to be each month, and then I had to\r\n        pay more money at the first.\r\n\r\nPetitioner paid all the premiums once he became an additional driver on the Policy.\r\nTo the question, \"Did you have any understanding of what that meant, to be an\r\nadditional driver on the policy?,\" Petitioner responded, \"No. I need a cigarette. I'm\r\ngetting irritated.\" The deposition concluded at that point.\r\n\r\n      On January 14, 2009, the circuit court entered an order granting\r\nProgressive's motion for summary judgment, finding Petitioner was not entitled to\r\nUIM coverage under the Policy. First, the court found that Petitioner and Severn\r\nwere not engaged in a common-law marriage based on Petitioner's deposition\r\ntestimony that he and Severn were engaged at various times, ended their\r\nengagement each time, never decided on a date to be married, were no longer\r\n\r\n1   At the time they ended their engagement, Severn resided in Maryland.\r\n\nengaged, and Severn resided in Maryland, a state that does not recognize common-\r\nlaw marriage. Second, the circuit court rejected Petitioner's argument that he was a\r\n\"named insured\" under the Policy based on the doctrine of reasonable expectations.\r\nFinally, relying on Ex Parte United Services Automobile Association, 365 S.C. 50,\r\n614 S.E.2d 652 (Ct. App. 2005) [hereinafter Ex Parte USAA], the circuit court\r\nfound that because Petitioner was listed as a \"driver\" on the declarations page of\r\nthe Policy but not as a \"named insured,\" and the Policy was clear regarding\r\ncoverage, Petitioner was not entitled to UIM coverage under the Policy based on\r\nany ambiguity in the policy language.\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion. See Bell v.\r\nProgressive Direct Ins. Co., Op. No. 2011-UP-242 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 23,\r\n2011). The court of appeals held that Petitioner was not an \"insured\" under the\r\nPolicy because the Policy explicitly provides for UIM for an \"insured person,\"\r\nwhich it defines as \"you or a relative,\" and Petitioner did not fall within either\r\ndefinition. Id. With respect to Petitioner's argument that the Policy was\r\nambiguous, the court of appeals held that the mere fact that the Policy did not\r\ndefine \"household resident\" did not in itself render the Policy ambiguous. Id.\r\n(citing Ex parte USAA, 365 S.C. at 55, 614 S.E.2d at 654). The court of appeals\r\nfound that Petitioner and Severn were not engaged in a common-law marriage, as\r\nthe evidence merely indicated that they were \"engaged to be married at some\r\nundetermined point in the future\" and clearly \"did not have a present intent to be\r\nmarried but instead a future intent to be married.\" Id. Finally, the court of appeals\r\nrefused to adopt the doctrine of reasonable expectations, citing Allstate Insurance\r\nCo. v. Mangum, 299 S.C. 226, 231, 383 S.E.2d 464, 466–67 (Ct. App. 1989).2\r\nHowever, assuming the doctrine applied, the court of appeals stated that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The court of appeals acknowledged that Mangum discussed the doctrine of\r\nreasonable expectations in dicta, but found that the doctrine was not recognized\r\nunder South Carolina law:\r\n\r\n      Admittedly, the court's statement in Mangum is not the law of the\r\n      case; however, the supreme court has consistently held that\r\n      unambiguous insurance policies are subject to the general rules of\r\n      contract construction.\r\n\r\nBell, Op. No. 2011-UP-242 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 23, 2011) (citations omitted).\r\n\n           because the doctrine cannot be reconciled with the rule that\r\n           unambiguous insurance policies are subject to the traditional rules of\r\n           contract construction, this court is precluded from adopting the\r\n           doctrine,\r\n\r\nas \"[s]uch a departure from jurisprudence must be left to our supreme court.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the court of\r\nappeals' decision, and this Court granted certiorari.3\r\n\r\n                                           ISSUES\r\n\r\n    I.\t       Whether the court of appeals erred in upholding the circuit court's \n\r\n              finding that the Policy is not ambiguous?\n\r\n\r\n    II.\t      Whether the court of appeals erred in refusing to adopt the doctrine\r\n              of reasonable expectations and in finding that the doctrine of\r\n              reasonable expectations was inapplicable to the facts of this case?\r\n\r\n    III.\t Whether the court of appeals erred in finding that there was no \n\r\n          genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether Petitioner \n\r\n          was engaged in a common-law marriage?\n\r\n\r\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       Summary judgment should be granted when there are no genuine issues of\r\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP; Lanham v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356,\r\n361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002) (\"An appellate court reviews a grant of summary\r\njudgment under the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56,\r\n\r\n\r\n3The Court accepted amici curiae briefs from United Policyholders and the South\r\nCarolina Association of Justice (SCAJ) in support of Petitioner, and Property &\r\nCasualty Insurers Association of America (Property & Casualty Association) and\r\nAllstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company (Allstate) in support of\r\nProgressive. See Rule 213, SCACR.\r\n\nSCRCP.\" (citation omitted)). \"Summary judgment is not appropriate where further\r\ninquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law\"\r\nand \"should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if\r\nthere is disagreement concerning the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.\"\r\nLanham, 349 S.C. at 362, 563 S.E.2d at 333 (citations omitted). As in the trial\r\ncourt, \"[o]n appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court\r\nwill review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the\r\nevidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.\" Id.

Chesterfield Lumber Co., 267 S.C. 607, 230 S.E.2d 447 (1976)). \"[I]n\r\ncases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving\r\nparty is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a\r\nmotion for summary judgment.\" Hancock v.

Richland Cnty., 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). \"When\r\nthe purpose of the underlying dispute is to determine whether coverage exists\r\nunder an insurance policy, the action is one at law.\" Crossmann Cmtys. of N.C.,\r\nInc. v.

Id. at 47, 717\r\nS.E.2d at 592.                        ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.     Contract Ambiguity\r\n\r\n      Petitioner argues that he is entitled to coverage under the Policy because its\r\nterms are ambiguous, and as such, must be construed in his favor. See, e.g.,\r\nDiamond State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, 456 S.E.2d\r\n912, 915 (1995) (\"Ambiguous or conflicting terms in an insurance policy must be\r\n\nconstrued liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.\").\r\nRespondent contends that the court of appeals' case, Ex parte USAA, 365 S.C. at\r\n50, 614 S.E.2d at 652, is directly applicable to these facts, and forecloses a finding\r\nof ambiguity here. We agree.\r\n\r\n       In that case, the appellant argued that she should be permitted to stack\r\ncoverage under the policy at issue because she was listed as an \"operator\" on the\r\ndeclarations page of the policy.4 Id. at 53, 614 S.E.2d at 653. More specifically,\r\nthe appellant argued that the term \"operator\" created an ambiguity as to whether\r\nshe was a named insured under the policy, and therefore, the ambiguous terms\r\nshould be resolved in favor of coverage. Id. at 54, 614 S.E.2d at 654. Noting that\r\n\"[t]he majority view is that listing a driver on the declarations page of an insurance\r\npolicy does not make that person a named insured,\" the court of appeals found the\r\ninsured was not entitled to stack under the policy terms. Id. at 55, 614 S.E.2d at\r\n654; see also, e.g., Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Williams, 472 S.E.2d 220, 222\r\n(N.C. Ct. App. 1996) (finding \"driver\" and \"named insured\" were not synonymous\r\nbecause to hold otherwise would extend \"named insured\" beyond its common\r\nsense meaning).5\r\n\r\n       Moreover, the court of appeals held that the policy's failure to define the\r\nterm \"operator\" in the policy did not cause ambiguity in the policy because\r\n\"operator\" could be defined \"according to the usual understanding of the term's\r\nsignificance to the ordinary person.\" Ex parte USAA, 365 S.C. at 55, 614 S.E.2d at\r\n654 (quoting Mfrs. & Merchs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Harvey, 330 S.C. 152, 158, 498\r\nS.E.2d 222, 225 (Ct. App. 1998)). Therefore, because the appellant was listed as\r\nan \"operator\" and not the \"named insured\" in the policy, the court of appeals\r\ndenied coverage. Id. at 56, 498 S.E.2d at 655.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4The named insured under the policy \"treated [the appellant] as if she were her\r\ndaughter and served as her guardian, though it [was] unclear whether a legal\r\nadoption ever took place,\" but it was undisputed that at the time of the accident, the\r\nappellant no longer resided with the named insured. Ex parte USAA, 365 S.C. at\r\n52, 54, 614 S.E.2d at 652, 653–54.\r\n5The court noted that some jurisdictions have found coverage in this situation\r\nunder the doctrine of reasonable expectations. Ex parte USAA, 365 S.C. at 54, 614\r\nS.E.2d at 654.\r\n\n       Using the same reasoning, we find the Policy's terms were not ambiguous.\r\nDespite being listed as a \"driver\" or \"household resident,\" there is no doubt that\r\nPetitioner was not a \"named insured\" as defined in the Policy. Because UIM\r\ncoverage was only available to either \"a person or persons shown as a named\r\ninsured on the Declarations Page\" and \"the spouse of a named insured if residing in\r\nthe same household,\" we find that the Policy unambiguously forecloses UIM\r\ncoverage to Petitioner.\r\n\r\n    II.   Doctrine of Reasonable Expectations\r\n\r\n       In the alterative, Petitioner argues that the Court should extend coverage to\r\nPetitioner under the doctrine of reasonable expectations.6 More specifically,\r\nPetitioner argues that his status as a \"household resident,\" which the Policy does\r\nnot define, is an ambiguous provision which renders the doctrine of reasonable\r\nexpectations operable based on his reasonable expectations that he had UIM\r\ncoverage at the time of the accident. Petitioner and supporting amici argue that the\r\ndoctrine embodies established legal principles, developed out of modern contract\r\ntheory, and is rooted in common law principles. Progressive contends that South\r\nCarolina courts do not recognize the doctrine of reasonable expectations, and this\r\nCourt should not adopt the doctrine because it cannot be reconciled with the\r\ngeneral rules of contract construction.\r\n\r\n      We agree with Petitioner and supporting amici that the doctrine of reasonable\r\nexpectations, in its traditional formulation, identifies a \"broader principle\r\nunderlying the 'cogeries of doctrines' comprising the rules of insurance policy\r\ninterpretation.\" (quoting Robert E. Keeton, Insurance Law: Basic Text 351 (1971);\r\nRobert E. Keeton, Reasonable Expectations in the Second Decade, 12 Forum 275\r\n(1976)).7 However, we decline to apply the doctrine where a contract of insurance\r\n\r\n6 Under the doctrine of reasonable expectations, \"[t]he objectively reasonable\r\nexpectations of applicants and intended beneficiaries regarding the terms of\r\ninsurance contracts will be honored even though painstaking study of the policy\r\nprovisions would have negated those expectations.\" Robert E. Keeton, Insurance\r\nLaw Rights at Variance with Policy Provisions: Part One, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 961,\r\n967 (1970).\r\n7 Most commentators and courts discussing the doctrine agree that the doctrine of\r\nreasonable expectations is not at odds with traditional notions of contract\r\ninterpretation, but a mere extension of these principles and is rooted in several\r\n\nunambiguously denies coverage under its plain terms.\r\n\r\n       South Carolina courts have a long history of formalistic interpretation with\r\nrespect to all contracts and have repeatedly held that the \"[i]nsurance policies are\r\nsubject to general rules of contract construction,\" and therefore, we \"must enforce,\r\nnot write contracts of insurance and . . . must give policy language its plain,\r\nordinary and popular meaning\" and \"should not torture the meaning of policy\r\nlanguage in order to extend or defeat coverage that was never intended by the\r\nparties.\" Gambrell v. Travelers Ins. Cos., 280 S.C. 69, 70, 310 S.E.2d 814, 816\r\n\r\n\r\nwell-established principles of common law:\r\n\r\n      When the insured's expectation is created by some kind of ambiguity\r\n      or vagueness in the policy language, syntax, or organization,\r\n      something like the doctrine of contra proferentem . . . is operating.\r\n      When the insured's expectation comes from some assertion by an\r\n      agent of the insurer or through the insurer's advertising, something\r\n      like the doctrine of misrepresentation or deceit is operating. When the\r\n      insured's expectation is grounded in an assumption that coverage for\r\n      the loss in question would exist given the amount of premium\r\n      charged, something like the doctrine of unconscionability is operating.\r\n      When the insured's expectation is part and parcel of the insured's\r\n      sudden surprise and dismay at the absence of coverage, something\r\n      like the doctrine of mistake is operating. When the insured's\r\n      expectation comes from the insurer's invitation to the insured to place\r\n      trust in the insurer that the insured's coverage needs will be\r\n      satisfactorily met, something like an estoppel or reliance theory is\r\n      operating.\r\n\r\nRobert H.

Thus, \"[w]hen a contract is unambiguous,\r\nclear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have\r\nused.\" B.L.G. Enters., Inc. v. First Fin. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529, 535, 514 S.E.2d\r\n327, 330 (1999).\r\n\r\n        Our jurisprudence does not support the creation of a substantive right in\r\nreasonable expectations. However, the reasonable expectations of parties entering\r\nan insurance contract will be honored within the confines of our interpretive rules\r\nand fairness principles. See, e.g., S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, 398\r\nS.C. 604, 615, 730 S.E.2d 862, 867 (2012) (\"Although [the insurer] contends this\r\ndispute can be resolved by a literal interpretation of the plain language of 'physical\r\ncontact,' we disagree, as the Supreme Court of Rhode Island recently observed the\r\nliteral interpretation of policy language will be rejected where its application would\r\nlead to unreasonable results and the definitions as written would be so narrow as to\r\nmake coverage merely 'illusory.'\" (quoting Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Cos. v.\r\nCitizens Ins. Co., 43 A.3d 56, 60 (R.I. 2012))). To this end, we find the Delaware\r\nSupreme Court's reasoning instructive:\r\n\r\n      [A] fundamental premise of the doctrine is that the policy will be read\r\n      in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured \"so far\r\n      as its language will permit.\" Thus, the rule, as recognized by this\r\n      Court, is consistent with the general rules of construction, to which we\r\n      have referred, that is, the Court will look to the reasonable\r\n      expectations of the insured at the time when he entered into the\r\n      contract if the terms thereof are ambiguous or conflicting, or if the\r\n      policy contains a hidden trap or pitfall, or if the fine print takes away\r\n      that which has been given by the large print. But the doctrine is not a\r\n      rule granting substantive rights to an insured when there is no doubt\r\n      as to the meaning of policy language.\r\n\r\nHallowell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 443 A.2d 925, 927 (Del. 1982)\r\n(emphasis added) (citation omitted); see also Clark-Peterson Co., Inc. v. Indep.\r\nIns. Assocs., Ltd., 492 N.W.2d 675, 677 (Iowa 1992) (\"But the doctrine does not\r\ncontemplate the expansion of insurance coverage on a general equitable basis. The\r\ndoctrine is carefully circumscribed; it can only be invoked where an exclusion '(1)\r\nis bizarre or oppressive, (2) eviscerates terms explicitly agreed to, or (3) eliminates\r\nthe dominant purpose of the transaction.'\" (quoting Aid (Mut.) Ins. v. Steffen, 423\r\nN.W.2d 189, 192 (Iowa 1988); Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sandbulte, 302\r\n\nN.W.2d 104, 112 (Iowa 1981))). This approach is supported by South Carolina\r\nlaw.  Thus, while we now hold that reasonable expectations may be used as\r\nanother interpretive tool, the doctrine cannot be used to alter the plain terms of an\r\ninsurance policy.8\r\n\r\n    III.   Common-Law Marriage\r\n\r\n      Finally, Petitioner avers that he is a \"relative\" of Severn for purposes of UIM\r\ncoverage under the Policy because they were engaged in a common-law marriage.\r\n\r\n      The existence of a common-law marriage is a question of law. Campbell v.\r\nChristian, 235 S.C. 102, 104, 110 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1959). The trial court's findings of\r\nfact with respect to this question will be upheld if they are supported by any\r\nevidence in the record. Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 623, 620 S.E.2d 59, 62\r\n(2005). The party asserting the marriage bears the burden of proving the common-\r\nlaw marriage by a preponderance of the evidence. Ex parte Blizzard, 185 S.C. 131,\r\n133, 193 S.E. 633, 634 (1937).\r\n\r\n       \"A common-law marriage is formed when two parties contract to be\r\nmarried.\" Callen, 365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62 (citing Johnson v. Johnson,\r\n235 S.C. 542, 550, 112 S.E.2d 647, 651 (1960)). However, \"[n]o express contract\r\nis necessary;\" instead, \"the agreement may be inferred from the circumstances.\" Id.\r\n(citations omitted). Therefore,\r\n\r\n       [t]he fact finder is to look for mutual assent: the intent of each party to\r\n       be married to the other and a mutual understanding of each party's\r\n       intent. Consideration is the participation in the marriage. If these\r\n       factual elements are present, then the court should find as a matter of\r\n       law that a common-law marriage exists.\r\n\r\n8 Regardless, the Record is unclear regarding what expectations Petitioner held\r\nwith respect to coverage under the Policy. Petitioner testified he added himself to\r\nthe insurance policy to avoid being arrested for driving without insurance. He also\r\ntestified he did not have an understanding of what it meant to be listed as a\r\n\"household resident\" under the policy, and did not state he reasonably expected to\r\nbe covered as a named insured for UIM purposes. Thus, it is unclear how the\r\ndoctrine would apply under these facts.\r\n\nId. Moreover, \"when the proponent proves that the parties participated in\r\n'apparently matrimonial' cohabitation, and that while cohabitating the parties had a\r\nreputation in the community as being married, a rebuttable presumption arises that\r\na common-law marriage was created.\" Id. (citing Jeanes v. Jeanes, 255 S.C. 161,\r\n166–67, 177 S.E.2d 537, 539–40 (1970)). A party may overcome the presumption\r\nby presenting \"'strong, cogent'\" evidence that the parties in fact never agreed to\r\nmarry.\" Id. (quoting Jeanes, 255 S.C. at 167, 177 S.E.2d at 540).9\r\n\r\n       In our view, Petitioner's deposition testimony unequivocally confirms that\r\nPetitioner and Severn, while cohabitating and sharing domestic and financial\r\nresponsibilities, were merely engaged to be married. Thus, the circuit court and\r\ncourt of appeals' finding that no common-law marriage existed between Petitioner\r\nand Severn is supported by the evidence.\r\n\r\n9 We note that it was the exclusive province of the family court to determine the\r\nexistence of a common-law marriage in this case. See Thomas v. McGriff, 368\r\nS.C. 485, 488, 629 S.E.2d 359, 360 (2006) (\"[J]urisdiction to determine the\r\nexistence of a common-law marriage depends upon the ultimate issue before the\r\ncourt. If the ultimate issue is heirship, which is within the probate court's exclusive\r\njurisdiction, then the probate court has jurisdiction to resolve the threshold issue\r\nwhether the decedent was a party to a common-law marriage. If the existence of a\r\ncommon-law marriage is itself the ultimate issue, then the family court has\r\nexclusive jurisdiction.\"); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 63-5-530(B) (2010) (providing\r\nthat \"[n]otwithstanding another provision of law, the family court and the probate\r\ncourt have concurrent jurisdiction to hear and determine matters relating to\r\npaternity, common-law marriage, and interpretation of marital agreements; except\r\nthat the concurrent jurisdiction of the probate court extends only to matters dealing\r\nwith the estate, trust, and guardianship and conservatorship actions before the\r\nprobate court\"). Therefore, Petitioner should have sought a declaration of\r\ncommon-law marriage in the family court, and the trial court and court of appeals\r\nerred in addressing the issue. However, for purposes of judicial economy we\r\naddress the merits of the issue here. See, e.g., Treece v. State, 365 S.C. 134, 136\r\nn.1, 616 S.E.2d 424, 425 n.1 (2005) (\"Although this issue should have been\r\nappealed to the Administrative Law Court as provided in Al-Shabazz v. State, 338\r\nS.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000), we dispose of it for purposes of judicial\r\neconomy.\"); Jeter v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 369 S.C. 433, 441 n.6, 633 S.E.2d 143,\r\n147 n. 6 (2006) (holding that regardless of any preservation problems, the appellate\r\ncourt would address an issue in the interest of judicial economy).\r\n\n       Because we find no common-law marriage existed, Petitioner does not meet\r\nthe definition of \"relative\" in the Policy, which is defined as \"a person residing in\r\nthe same household as you, and related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption.\"\r\n(Emphasis removed). Therefore, we affirm the court of appeals' finding as to this\r\nissue.                             CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals' decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Ten health care entities, along with the South Carolina Hospital\r\nAssociation and the South Carolina Health Care Association (collectively,\r\nPetitioners), seek a declaration from this Court that the South Carolina Department\r\nof Health and Human Services (DHEC) is obligated to enforce the State\r\nCertification of Need and Health Facility Licensure Act (the CON Act)1 and fund\r\nthe certificate of need (CON) program despite the South Carolina House of\r\nRepresentative's failure to override the Governor's veto of the line item in the state\r\nbudget providing funding for the program. We grant Petitioners' requested relief.\r\n\r\n                        FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n        The South Carolina General Assembly initially passed the CON Act in 1971.\r\nIt is a comprehensive approach to containing health care costs for South\r\nCarolinians by controlling the construction of health care facilities, the provision of\r\ncertain services, and the purchase of health care equipment so as to avoid\r\nduplication of health care services. Since its adoption in 1971, the CON Act and\r\nits corresponding regulations have evolved into a sophisticated regulatory scheme.\r\nUnder the CON Act, a person or health care facility must obtain a CON from\r\nDHEC before constructing a new health care facility, establishing certain health\r\ncare services, making capital expenditures on certain health care projects, or\r\nacquiring certain types of health care equipment. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-160\r\n(Supp. 2013). In addition, the CON Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant\r\nto the CON Act set forth, inter alia, specific CON application procedures, project\r\nreview criteria, and penalties for non-compliance. S.C. Code Ann. §§ 44-7-110 to\r\n-394 (2002 & Supp. 2013); 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. §§ 61-15 (2012). DHEC is\r\nresponsible for administering the CON program. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-140.\r\n\r\n1   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 44-7-110 to -394 (2002 & Supp. 2013).\r\n\n      In August 2012, DHEC submitted its agency appropriations request to\r\nGovernor Nikki Haley for Fiscal Year 2013–2014, requesting appropriations for\r\nfour programs: (I) Administration; (II) Programs and Services; (III) Employee\r\nBenefits; and (IV) Non-[R]ecurring Appropriations. DHEC requested funding for\r\nthe CON Program in subsection (II)(F)(2), Facility & Service Development.\r\nDHEC specifically asked for a $773,000 increase from the previous year to be paid\r\nfrom the state's general fund to fund the CON program, resulting in a total of\r\n$1,759,915 requested funding for subsection (II)(F)(2). However, in her Executive\r\nBudget for Fiscal Year 2013–2014, the Governor recommended no additional\r\nfunding for the CON program and only allocated a total of $986,615 in combined\r\nfunds for subsection (II)(F)(2).\r\n\r\n      In its 2013–2014 appropriations bill, the General Assembly appropriated\r\n$1,759,915 to DHEC for subsection (II)(F)(2), as requested by DHEC. By letter\r\ndated June 25, 2013, the Governor vetoed certain line items in the General\r\nAssembly's appropriations bill. Veto 20, entitled \"Closing Programs That Don't\r\nWork\" (Veto 20), specifically vetoed subsection (II)(F)(2). In her veto message,\r\nthe Governor stated: \"The [CON] Program is an intensely political one through\r\nwhich bureaucratic policy makers deny healthcare providers from offering\r\ntreatment. We should allow the market to work rather than politics.\"2\r\n\r\n       The House of Representatives sustained Veto 20.3 According to\r\nRepresentative Brian White, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee\r\n(Chairman White), he asked the House members to sustain Veto 20 because DHEC\r\nhad \"other funds in that agency they can use and [can] move other people over for\r\nthat purpose.\" Thereafter, the General Assembly passed Act No. 101, 2013 S.C.\r\nActs 1, the General Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2013–2014 (the 2013–2014\r\nAppropriations Act).\r\n\r\n2 Although subsection (II)(F)(2) included funding for other services such as the\r\nCertificate of Public Advantage program, review of architectural plans, inspection\r\nof the construction of health care facilities, and fire and life safety requirement\r\ninspections at health care facilities, the Governor's veto message only specifically\r\nmentioned the CON program.\r\n3Only if the body in which a bill originated overrides a veto is the veto sent to the\r\nother body for its consideration. Therefore, because the House of Representatives\r\ndid not override Veto 20, it was not sent to the Senate for its consideration.\r\n\n       On June 28, 2013, DHEC Director Catherine Templeton issued a letter to\r\nhealth care providers communicating that DHEC would no longer fund the CON\r\nprogram. In pertinent part, the letter stated:\r\n\r\n      The sustained veto shows the intention of both the Executive and\r\n      Legislative branches to suspend the operation of the [CON] program\r\n      for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013. . . . [DHEC] has no\r\n      independent authority to expend state funds for [the CON program]\r\n      and therefore, the veto completely suspends the program for the\r\n      upcoming fiscal year. Accordingly, [DHEC] cannot review new or\r\n      existing applications for [CONs] as of July 1. Moreover, [DHEC]\r\n      cannot take any [CON] enforcement action. Should the General\r\n      Assembly restore the program in the future, [DHEC] will not be\r\n      inclined to take enforcement actions under [the CON Act] for activity\r\n      that occurs during the program's suspension, unless instructed\r\n      otherwise by the General Assembly. Suspending the program has the\r\n      practical effect of allowing new and expanding health care facilities to\r\n      move forward without the [CON] process.\r\n\r\n      In response, Chairman White and Representative Murrell Smith,\r\nChairman of the Ways and Means healthcare subcommittee, issued a\r\nstatement regarding Veto 20, stating in pertinent part that \"[t]he House of\r\nRepresentatives did not intend to eliminate the CON Program or its statutory\r\nrequirements. In fact, the House believes there are a number of ways for the\r\nCON Program to retain its function and purpose.\"\r\n\r\n       DHEC discontinued the CON program effective July 1, 2013. As of that\r\ndate, DHEC had thirty-nine undecided CON applications and requests pending.\r\n\r\n      Petitioners, each past CON recipients, future CON applicants, or pending\r\nCON applicants, filed a petition for original jurisdiction, seeking declarations that\r\nDHEC's duty to administer the CON program during Fiscal Year 2013–2014 was\r\nnot suspended and that DHEC has a duty to seek alternative means of funding.\r\n\r\n       Pursuant to Rule 245, SCACR, we granted Petitioners' petition for original\r\njurisdiction. We further accepted the Governor's amicus curiae brief pursuant to\r\nRule 213, SCACR.\r\n\n                                       ISSUES\r\n\r\n      I.\t    Whether DHEC's duty to administer the CON program was\r\n             suspended for Fiscal Year 2013–2014 after the House of\r\n             Representatives sustained the Governor's line item veto\r\n             eliminating funding for the program?\r\n\r\n      II.\t   Whether DHEC must fund the administration and enforcement\r\n             of the CON program?    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      We preface our opinion by emphasizing the significance of the separation of\r\npowers doctrine to the decision we must render in this matter. The South Carolina\r\nConstitution provides:\r\n\r\n      In the government of this State, the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\n      powers of the government shall be forever separate and distinct from each\r\n      other, and no person or persons exercising the functions of one of said\r\n      departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. 1, § 8. This constitutional mandate \"prevents the concentration of\r\npower in the hands of too few, and provides a system of checks and balances.\"\r\nHampton v. Haley, 403 S.C. 395, 403, 743 S.E.2d 258, 262 (2013); State ex rel.\r\nMcLeod v. McInnis, 278 S.C. 307, 312, 295 S.E.2d 633, 636 (1982). The General\r\nAssembly \"has plenary power over all legislative matters unless limited by some\r\nconstitutional provision.\" Hampton, 403 S.C. at 403, 743 S.E.2d at 262 (citing\r\nClarke v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth., 177 S.C. 427, 438–39, 181 S.E.2d 481, 486\r\n(1935)). The executive branch, on the other hand, \"is constitutionally tasked with\r\nensuring 'that the laws be faithfully executed.'\" Id. (quoting S.C. Const. art. IV, §\r\n15).   History reveals that litigation often arises because of conflicts between the\r\nbranches of the government. McLeod, 278 S.C. at 312–13, 295 S.E.2d at 636.\r\nWhile case law within our state and across the nation involving separation of\r\npowers disputes is not a model of consistency, one theme reverberates throughout:\r\nthe court's role in upholding the separation of powers doctrine is to maintain the\r\nthree branches of government in positions of equality. When asked to resolve a\r\nconflict in which the Governor attempts use her veto pen to rewrite a permanent\r\n\nlaw, this Court must adhere to well-established separation of powers principles,\r\nleaving the power to legislate to the General Assembly, and the power to execute\r\nthe laws and to veto legislation to the Governor.\r\n\r\n      I.     Enforcement of the CON Act\r\n\r\n       The General Assembly must provide annually for all expenditures in a\r\ngeneral appropriations act in order to fund the ordinary expenses of state\r\ngovernment and to direct the expenditure of these funds. S.C. Code Ann. § 2-7-60\r\n(2005); Ex parte Georgetown Cnty. Water & Sewer Dist., 284 S.C. 466, 469, 327\r\nS.E.2d 654, 656 (1985) (citations omitted). Pursuant to the South Carolina\r\nConstitution, \"[b]ills appropriating money out of the Treasury shall specify the\r\nobjects and purposes for which the same are made, and appropriate to them\r\nrespectively their several amounts in distinct items and sections.\" S.C. Const. art.\r\nIV, § 21 (emphasis added); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 2-7-60 (requiring that all\r\nappropriations \"shall be in a definite sum for each purpose or activity with such\r\nitemization under the activity as may be deemed necessary by the General\r\nAssembly\"). In other words, the General Assembly must structure each\r\nappropriations act so that each item or section designates an amount of money\r\nallocated for a particular function.\r\n\r\n        Upon an appropriation act's ratification, the act is sent to the Governor for\r\nhis or her approval. Unlike the general veto power, the Governor has the authority\r\nto line item veto a general appropriations act. If the Governor exercises his or her\r\nline item veto power, the General Assembly then has the opportunity to either\r\nsustain or override the veto. The Governor returns his or her veto, along with a\r\nveto message, to the body in which the bill originated. S.C. Const. art. IV, § 21.\r\nIn the case of a general appropriations act, the House initiates the bill and first\r\nreceives a veto. If the House overrides the veto by an affirmative two-thirds vote,\r\nthen the veto is sent to the Senate for its consideration. See id. Therefore, the\r\nGeneral Assembly may override a line item veto by an affirmative two-thirds vote\r\nof each chamber. Id. However, if either chamber of the General Assembly does\r\nnot override the Governor's veto, it is sustained, and the line is stricken. At that\r\npoint, the bill becomes law notwithstanding the Governor's veto. Id.; Edwards v.\r\nState, 383 S.C. 82, 91, 678 S.E.2d 412, 417 (2009). The extent and particularities\r\nof the Governor's and the General Assembly's respective powers in this setting are\r\ncrucial to the outcome of this matter, and we will address each in turn.\r\n\n            A. Governor's Line item Veto Power\r\n\r\n      The Governor may exercise the veto power \"only when clearly authorized\r\nby the constitution, and the language conferring it is to be strictly construed.\"\r\nJackson v. Sanford, 398 S.C. 580, 584, 731 S.E.2d 722, 724 (2011); Drummond v.\r\nBeasley, 331 S.C. 559, 569, 503 S.E.2d 455, 457 (1998). Article IV, section 21 of\r\nthe Constitution provides for the Governor's line item veto power as follows:\r\n\r\n      If the Governor shall not approve any one or more of the items or\r\n      sections contained in any bill appropriating money, but shall approve\r\n      of the residue thereof, it shall become a law as to the residue in like\r\n      manner as if he had signed it. The Governor shall then return the bill\r\n      with his objections to the items or sections of the same not approved\r\n      by him to the house in which the bill originated, which house shall\r\n      enter the objections at large upon its Journal and proceed to reconsider\r\n      so much of the bill as is not approved by the Governor. The same\r\n      proceedings shall be had in both houses in reconsidering the same as\r\n      is provided in case of an entire bill returned by the Governor with his\r\n      objections; and if any item or section of the bill not approved by the\r\n      Governor shall be passed by two-thirds of each house of the General\r\n      Assembly, it shall become a part of the law notwithstanding the\r\n      objections of the Governor.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. IV, § 21 (emphasis added). The Governor's line item veto is a\r\n\"negative power to void a distinct item.\" Drummond, 331 S.C. at 565, 503 S.E.2d\r\nat 457.\r\n\r\n      Under article IV, section 21, \"the Governor can only veto those parts [in an\r\nappropriations bill] labeled by the legislature as items or sections.\" Drummond,\r\n331 S.C. at 563, 503 S.E.2d at 456. Over the years, this Court has developed case\r\nlaw interpreting the reach of the Governor's power to veto \"items or sections\"\r\nwithin an appropriations bill. See, e.g., Jackson, 398 S.C. at 589, 731 S.E.2d at\r\n726–27; Drummond, 331 S.C. at 563, 503 S.E.2d at 457; S.C. Coin Operators\r\nAss'n v. Beasley, 320 S.C. 183, 187–188, 464 S.E.2d 103, 105 (1995); Cox v.\r\nBates, 237 S.C. 198, 220, 116 S.E.2d 828, 837 (1960); State ex rel. Long v. Jones,\r\n99 S.C. 89, 92, 82 S.E.2d 882, 883 (1914). These decisions, interpreting the\r\nGovernor's line item veto authority, certainly impact the effect of the House of\r\n\nRepresentatives' failure to override Veto 20. In striving to maintain the proper\r\nconstitutional balance between the branches of our state's government, we take this\r\nopportunity to clarify and modify the language in one of these cases.\r\n\r\n       In Jackson v. Sanford, this Court found the Governor's line item veto of part\r\nof an item within an appropriations bill resulted in improper modification of\r\nlegislation and thus was an unconstitutional exercise of the veto power. 398 S.C.\r\nat 588–89, 731 S.E.2d at 726–27. In that case, Governor Sanford purported to veto\r\nthe portion of funds allocated to the State Budget and Control Board to be drawn\r\nfrom the General Fund, yet did not veto the purpose for which those funds were\r\nallocated. Id. at 583, 587, 731 S.E.2d at 723, 725. According to the Court, the \"net\r\nresult\" of the Governor's line item veto was that \"the total appropriation for each of\r\nthe Board's programs, positions, and expenses was reduced by the amount the\r\nGeneral Assembly had designed to be drawn from the General Fund, but the\r\nprograms, positions, and expenses themselves were not eliminated.\" Id. at 587,\r\n731 S.E.2d at 725.\r\n\r\n       The Court began its analysis in Jackson by defining \"'item' for constitutional\r\npurposes,\" as \"embrac[ing] a specified sum of money together with the 'object and\r\npurpose' for which the appropriation is made.\" Id. at 585, 731 S.E.2d at 725\r\n(footnote omitted) (citing S.C. const. art. IV, § 21). The Court then stated that if \"a\r\nline in the appropriations bill is vetoed in a constitutional manner and the veto is\r\nsustained, then the line is stricken and there is no longer any authority to expend\r\nstate funds for the purpose stated on the line.\" Id. at 588, 731 S.E.2d at 726\r\n(citation omitted). Finally, the Court concluded that the Governor's veto in that\r\ncase was unconstitutional because \"the Governor is empowered to veto 'items,'\r\nwhich comprise both the designated funds and the objects and purposes for which\r\nthe appropriation is intended,\" but may not veto only part of an item. Id. at 589,\r\n731 S.E.2d at 726.\r\n\r\n        Today, we clarify the language in Jackson defining \"item\" and discussing a\r\nline item's objects and purposes. What is meant is that the line item veto\r\neliminates any authority to expend the vetoed funds for the objects and purposes\r\nspecified on the line. To the extent Jackson is read to imply that a line item's\r\nobjects and purposes refer to the underlying legislation, we now recognize that\r\nthese assertions in Jackson are imprecise. It is argued by DHEC that this language\r\nimplies and should be construed to mean that a line item veto extends beyond a\r\nline in an appropriations act to affect an underlying permanent law. This\r\nimplication is not intended.\r\n\n       The \"objects and purposes\" of a line item within an appropriations act\r\nmerely refer to the label—designating the funding for a particular purpose—that\r\nthe General Assembly must attach to any line item in an appropriations act. See\r\nS.C. const. art. IV, § 21; Ex parte Georgetown, 284 S.C. at 469, 327 S.E.2d at 656;\r\ncf. Fla. H.R. v. Martinez, 555 So. 2d 839, 843 (Fla. 1990) (defining a specific\r\nappropriation as an \"identifiable, integrated fund which the legislature has\r\nallocated for a specified purpose\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n       We hold that a Governor's line item veto destroys only the funding provided\r\nfor in that line item.4 Accordingly, the Governor has no authority to utilize the line\r\nitem veto power to negate the effect of a long-standing permanent law. The\r\nauthority to enact, modify, or repeal legislation lies solely within the General\r\nAssembly's broader authority. See McLeod, 278 S.C. at 312, 295 S.E.2d at 636.\r\nAs the Supreme Court of Florida has explained, the line item veto power \"is\r\nintended to be a negative power, the power to nullify, or at least suspend,\r\nlegislative intent. It is not designed to alter or amend legislative intent.\" Martinez,\r\n555 So. 2d at 843 (emphasis in original) (quoting Brown v. Firestone, 382 So. 2d\r\n654, 662 (Fla. 1980)).\r\n\r\n       While the line item in the 2013–2014 Appropriations Act provides funding\r\nfor the CON program, the underlying CON Act mandates the existence of the CON\r\nprogram. Therefore, we hold that Veto 20 reached only as far as to nullify the\r\nobject and purpose of section (II)(F)(2) of the 2013–2014 Appropriations Act—the\r\nfunding for the CON program and any other programs included in that line item.\r\n\r\n        The Governor's veto message leaves no doubt that she intended to use her\r\nline item veto power to abolish the entire CON program. However, the Governor\r\nis not empowered to exercise her veto pen in a manner that so broadly affects\r\npublic policy and attempts to alter legislative intent by reaching back to repeal a\r\npermanent law. See Hampton, 403 S.C. at 403, 743 S.E.2d at 262 (\"Included\r\nwithin the legislative power is the sole prerogative to make policy decisions; to\r\n\r\n4 Furthermore, to the extent that any language in this Court's prior decisions\r\nsuggests that a Governor's veto may nullify more than just the funding provided for\r\nin a line item, we find that language is overly broad. See, e.g., Drummond v.\r\nBeasley, 331 S.C. 559, 564, 503 S.E.2d 455, 457 (1998); State ex rel. Long v.\r\nJones, 99 S.C. 89, 82 S.E. 882 (1914) (stating that when a line item veto was\r\nsustained, \"everything embraced in that item failed to become law\").\r\n\nexercise discretion as to what the law will be.\" (citation omitted)). Absent a proper\r\ndelegation of power to a non-legislative body to make policy determinations,\r\n\"policymaking is an intrusion upon the legislative power.\" Id. Similarly, we agree\r\nwith the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that a \"principle of great\r\nimportance in our tripartite form of government is 'that it is for the Legislature, and\r\nnot the executive branch, to determine finally which social objectives or programs\r\nare worthy of pursuit.'\" Op. of the Justices, 376 N.E.2d 1217, 1221 (Mass. 1978)\r\n(citation omitted).\r\n\r\n       To permit the Governor to exercise her line item veto power to abolish the\r\nCON program—a program mandated by permanent law—would certainly alter and\r\namend legislative intent. Moreover, expanding the line item veto power to allow it\r\nto reach a permanent law enacted years earlier by vetoing a line item in an\r\nappropriations act would violate the separation of powers doctrine.\r\n\r\n       Notwithstanding the Governor's inability to abolish a program established by\r\npermanent legislation through a line item veto, we acknowledge that the General\r\nAssembly may suspend or repeal permanent legislation and effectively abolish a\r\nprogram established by such law. Therefore, because the House of Representatives\r\nsustained Veto 20, we must analyze now whether the General Assembly intended\r\nto suspend DHEC's duty to administer the CON program for Fiscal Year 2013–\r\n2014.        B. General Assembly's Intent to Suspend\r\n\r\n       As discussed supra, it is the General Assembly's prerogative to modify or\r\nrepeal legislation and to make policy decisions. See Hampton, 403 S.C. at 403,\r\n743 S.E.2d at 262. Here, we find that the General Assembly did not intend to\r\nsuspend DHEC's obligations under the CON Act for Fiscal Year 2013–2014.\r\n\r\n       There is no question that the General Assembly has the power, where there\r\nis no constitutional prohibition, to temporarily suspend a statute's operation.\r\nMcLeod, 256 S.C. at 26, 180 S.E.2d at 640. An appropriations act, though\r\ngenerally temporary in duration, \"has equal force and effect as a permanent statute\"\r\nand may suspend the operation of a permanent statute during the time the\r\nappropriation act is in force. Plowden v. Beattie, 185 S.C. 229, 236, 193 S.E. 651,\r\n654 (1937) (citations omitted). \"When such intention is clearly manifest[,] this\r\n[C]ourt has no choice but to give force and effect thereto.\" McLeod, 256 S.C. at\r\n26, 180 S.E.2d at 640.\r\n\n       The primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to\r\nthe intent of the General Assembly. Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332,\r\n342, 713 S.E.2d 278, 283 (2011). It is well-established that this Court will not\r\nconstrue a statute by concentrating on an isolated phrase. Laurens Cnty. Sch.\r\nDists. 55 & 56 v. Cox, 308 S.C. 171, 174, 417 S.E.2d 560, 561 (1992) (\"The true\r\nguide to statutory construction is not the phraseology of an isolated section or\r\nprovision, but the language of the statute as a whole considered in the light of its\r\nmanifest purpose. In applying the rule of strict construction the courts may not give\r\nto particular words a significance clearly repugnant to the meaning of the statute as\r\na whole, or destructive of its obvious intent.\"); see also Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of\r\nPhysical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606–07 (2006) (\"A\r\nstatute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation\r\nconsonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.\"). \"All rules of\r\nstatutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative intent must\r\nprevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language\r\nmust be construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute.\" State v. Sweat,\r\n386 S.C. 339, 350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010). Moreover, statutes dealing with\r\nthe same subject matter are in pari materia and must be construed together, if\r\npossible, to produce a single, harmonious result. Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342\r\nS.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000). Because we must presume that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is familiar with existing legislation, statutes dealing with the\r\nsame subject matter must be reconciled, if possible, so as to render both operative.\r\nHodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 88, 533 S.E.2d 578, 583 (2000) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       In determining whether a permanent statute is suspended, we must look to\r\nthe budget proviso juxtaposed with the permanent statute. Beaufort Cnty. v. S.C.\r\nState Election Comm'n, 395 S.C. 366, 371, 374, 718 S.E.2d 432, 435, 436 (2011).\r\nIn this regard, there must be an \"irreconcilable conflict\" between the appropriations\r\nact and the permanent statute before we will find the latter temporarily suspended.\r\nPlowden, 185 S.C. at 236, 193 S.E.2d at 654 (citations omitted). Thus, only\r\nprovisions of a permanent statute that conflict with the current budget provisos are\r\nsuspended. Beaufort Cnty., 395 S.C. at 374, 718 S.E.2d at 436 (citing McLeod,\r\n256 S.C. at 26, 180 S.E.2d at 640).\r\n\r\n       For example, in McLeod, the Court reconciled a controversy arising out of\r\ntwo legislative enactments dealing with state officers' salaries. 256 S.C. at 23, 180\r\nS.E.2d at 639. A permanent statute and an appropriations act each provided\r\ndiffering salary amounts for state officers, such as the Governor and Lieutenant\r\n\nGovernor.5 Id. at 24, 180 S.E.2d at 639–40. Citing precedents requiring an\r\n\"irreconcilable conflict\" and manifest legislative intent to suspend a permanent\r\nstatute, the Court found that the permanent statute designating salaries was\r\nsuspended during Fiscal Year 1970–1971 because there was an express conflict.\r\nId. at 27, 180 S.E.2d at 641.\r\n\r\n      Likewise, in Beaufort County, the Court considered whether an\r\nappropriations act allowing the State Election Commission to use funds toward a\r\npresidential primary suspended the temporal limitation of a permanent statute\r\nwhich authorized the State Election Commission and the county election\r\ncommissions to conduct presidential primaries for the particular election cycle.\r\n395 S.C. at 369–71, 718 S.E.2d at 434–35. The Governor vetoed the budget\r\nprovisos, but the General Assembly overrode the vetoes. Id. at 374–75, 718 S.E.2d\r\nat 437. In holding that the appropriations act suspended the temporal limitation of\r\nthe permanent statute and authorized the commissions to conduct a presidential\r\nprimary, the Court discerned legislative intent from both \"the statutory scheme and\r\nbudget provisos,\" finding the General Assembly intended to temporarily suspend\r\nthe conflicting temporal limitation of the permanent statute in favor of the budget\r\nproviso. Id. at 374, 718 S.E.2d at 436.\r\n\r\n       In contrast to McLeod and Beaufort County, we find no irreconcilable\r\nconflict between the CON Act and the absence of funding in the 2013–2014\r\nAppropriations Act. The failure to fund the CON program does not negate the\r\ndirective issued by the General Assembly (and detailed in the CON Act)\r\nmandating DHEC administer the CON program.\r\n\r\n       Even more importantly, we find that in sustaining Veto 20, the General\r\nAssembly did not intend to suspend DHEC's duty to administer the CON program.\r\nWe must evaluate the effect of Veto 20 in light of the entirety of the CON Act.\r\nThe CON program is mandated by the CON Act, a free-standing, permanent piece\r\nof legislation that has evolved into an expansive regulatory scheme, not by a line\r\nitem appropriation. DHEC does not argue that the General Assembly has repealed\r\nthe entire CON Act, but only that Veto 20 suspends DHEC’s duty to administer the\r\nCON program. We cannot conceive that by sustaining Veto 20, the General\r\nAssembly intended to abolish a program mandated by permanent law which itself\r\n\r\n5For example, the 1969 act fixed the Governor's salary at $35,000 and the 1970\r\nappropriations act provided for a $25,000 salary. McLeod, 256 S.C. at 24, 180\r\nS.E.2d at 639.\r\n\nhas not been repealed.6\r\n\r\n       Further, in construing the General Assembly's intent, we find great\r\nsignificance in the fact that only the House of Representatives had the opportunity\r\nto override Veto 20. Because the House failed to overrule Veto 20, the veto was\r\nnot sent to the Senate for its consideration. The Senate never had the opportunity\r\nto demonstrate its intent. Thus, a finding that the House of Representatives'\r\ndecision to sustain Veto 20 reflected the General Assembly's intent as a whole to\r\nsuspend the CON program would ignore an entire chamber's intent. We cannot\r\nsanction such a result.\r\n\r\n       Finally, DHEC urges this Court to consider the Governor's veto message in\r\ndetermining legislative intent. DHEC argues that by sustaining Veto 20, the House\r\nof Representatives agreed with the Governor's intention to abolish the CON\r\nprogram. We disagree. The Governor's veto message is not a part of the 2013–\r\n2014 Appropriations Act and \"does not have the force of law [because] it is\r\n[neither] a legislative act nor an Executive Order.\" Drummond, 331 S.C. at 564,\r\n503 S.E.2d at 458. To hold otherwise would violate the separation of powers\r\ndoctrine by altering the allocation of powers granted to the three branches of\r\ngovernment by our state’s constitution. Therefore, the Governor's veto message\r\nabolishing the CON program has no force of law. The power to abolish the CON\r\nprogram lies exclusively within the realm of the General Assembly and here, we\r\ncannot discern the requisite intent.\r\n\r\n       Although Veto 20 effectively struck the funding for subsection (II)(F)(2) in\r\nthe 2013–2014 Appropriations Act, we find that in sustaining Veto 20, the General\r\nAssembly did not intent to suspend the CON program. Therefore, we hold that\r\nDHEC has a duty to administer the CON program, as contemplated by the CON\r\nAct, for Fiscal Year 2013–2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 As evidence of legislative intent to suspend the CON program, DHEC points to\r\nthe final proviso in the 2013–2014 Appropriations which states that \"[a]ll acts or\r\nparts of acts inconsistent with any of the provisions of Part IA or IB of this act are\r\nsuspended for Fiscal Year 2013–2014.\" We do not find that this provision\r\nsuspends the CON program. Not only was this standard provision included pre-\r\nveto as a part of the General Assembly’s 2013–2014 appropriations bill initially\r\ngranting the funding DHEC requested, we cannot construe this provision in\r\nisolation.\r\n\n      II.    Funding the CON Program\r\n\r\n       Petitioners argue that DHEC is required to fund the CON program,\r\nregardless of the 2013–2014 Appropriations Act's failure to appropriate funding for\r\nthe program. We agree.\r\n\r\n       Our state's constitution unquestionably permits a Governor's line item\r\nveto—if constitutional and not overridden by the General Assembly—to eliminate\r\na line item providing funding for a particular purpose. See S.C. Const. art. IV, §\r\n21. Nevertheless, under separation of powers principles, \"[e]xecutive agencies are\r\nrequired to comply with the General Assembly's enactment of a law until it has\r\nbeen otherwise declared invalid.\" Edwards, 383 S.C. at 91, 678 S.E.2d at 417\r\n(citing Layman v. State, 376 S.C. 434, 450, 658 S.E.2d 320, 328 (2008)). In a case\r\nsuch as this, we recognize one caveat: \"[a]s creatures of statute, regulatory bodies\r\nsuch as DHEC possess only those powers which are specifically delineated.\" City\r\nof Rock Hill v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 302 S.C. 161, 165, 394\r\nS.E.2d 327, 330 (1990).\r\n\r\n       We have held that the permanent law mandating the CON program was not\r\naffected by House of Representatives' decision to sustain Veto 20. Under the CON\r\nAct, DHEC's responsibility to administer the CON Act is not discretionary, and\r\nthus, DHEC must comply with the CON Act—a duty that inevitably encompasses\r\nfunding the CON program.\r\n\r\n      DHEC contends that the General Assembly's failure to provide funding for\r\nthe CON program in the 2013–2014 Appropriations Act forecloses the possibility\r\nof administering the CON program. We view this argument as a smoke screen.\r\nContrary to DHEC's argument, we conceive at least two alternate means of funding\r\nthe CON program specifically delineated to DHEC.\r\n\r\n       First, DHEC may utilize its emergency regulatory authority to adopt a fee\r\nstructure to support the administration of the CON program. Section 44-7-150(5)\r\nof the South Carolina Code provides that DHEC \"may charge and collect fees to\r\ncover the cost of operating the [CON] program, including application fees, filing\r\nfees, issuance fees, and nonapplicability/exemption determination fees.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 44-7-150(5) (2010). DHEC \"shall develop regulations which set fees\r\nas authorized by this article.\" Id. The statute requires DHEC to determine the\r\nlevel of the fees \"after careful consideration of the direct and indirect costs incurred\r\n\nby [DHEC] in performing its various functions and services in the [CON]\r\nprogram.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       DHEC points to the statute's provision requiring that the first $750,000\r\ncollected in accordance with this section must be deposited into the general fund of\r\nthe state. Id. However, any fee collected in excess of $750,000 \"must be retained\r\nby [DHEC] and designated for the administrative costs of the [CON] program.\" Id.\r\nAccording to DHEC, it collected less than $750,000 in fees in each fiscal year\r\nsince 2010, meaning that all money collected during those years was deposited into\r\nthe state's general fund. Therefore, DHEC argues that it is unlikely that DHEC\r\ncould collect enough fees in Fiscal Year 2013–2014 to retain enough funding to\r\noperate the CON program. We find this argument unpersuasive. Section 44-7-\r\n150(5) clearly authorizes DHEC to charge and collect fees at any level of its\r\nchoosing. Neither the 2013–2014 Appropriations Act nor any other law limits that\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n        Second, the 2013–2014 Appropriations Act contains a general proviso\r\nstating, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      117.9. (GP: Transfers of Appropriations) Agencies and Institutions\r\n      shall be authorized to transfer appropriations within programs and\r\n      within the agency with notification to the Division of Budget and\r\n      Analyses and Comptroller General. No such transfer may exceed\r\n      twenty percent of the program budget. Upon request, details of such\r\n      transfers may be provided to members of the General Assembly on an\r\n      agency by agency basis.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.) Veto 20 and the General Assembly's failure to fund the CON\r\nProgram in the 2013–2014 Appropriations Act do not prevent DHEC from\r\nexercising this authority to transfer appropriations within the agency.7\r\n\r\n      DHEC has indicated an unwillingness to resort to this funding option.\r\nHowever, we find that proviso 117.9 provides DHEC with a feasible mechanism\r\nby which it could fund the CON program and thus carry out its statutorily\r\nmandated obligation. Therefore, we find that the General Assembly, through\r\nsection 44-7-150(5) and proviso 117.9, has provided DHEC with possibilities for\r\n\r\n7Indeed, Chairman White encouraged DHEC to do just that in his floor comments\r\non the veto.\r\n\nfunding the CON program other than the receipt of funds from the 2013–2014\r\nAppropriations Act. While we hold that DHEC must fund the CON program, we\r\ndecline to specify the manner in which DHEC must do so.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the House of Representatives'\r\ndecision to sustain Veto 20 did not suspend DHEC's duty to administer the CON\r\nprogram. Therefore, we declare that DHEC has a duty to administer and fund the\r\nCON program for Fiscal Year 2013–2014 as contemplated by the CON Act.\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT FOR PETITIONERS.\r\n\r\n BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLECIONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent. In my opinion, when the House\r\nsustained the Governor's veto, the effect was to prevent the expenditure of funds by\r\nDHEC for the CON program for fiscal year 2013-2014. Jackson v. Sanford, 398\r\nS.C. 580, 731 S.E.2d 722 (2011). In my view, the CON program and its\r\nrequirements remain the law, but all applications in process are suspended, no new\r\napplications can be accepted, and all other matters are in limbo unless and until the\r\nprogram is again funded.\r\n\r\nThe Governor's Veto 20 provides:\r\n\r\n             Veto 20 \t Part IA, Page 100; Section 34, Department of\r\n                       Health and Environmental Control; II.

State ex rel. Long v. Jones, 99 S.C. 89,\r\n82 S.E. 882 (1914). The House did not override this veto, and I know of no basis\r\nfor a court to inquire into the \"intent\" behind the House vote using maxims of\r\nstatutory construction.9 Nor do I understand the majority's concern that the Senate\r\n\r\n\r\n The majority errs when it relies upon statements concerning \"intent\" made by\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nmembers, whether found in the House Journal or other sources. Pursuant to the\r\nenrolled bill rule:  [T]he true rule is, that when an act has been duly signed\r\n             by the presiding officers of the General Assembly, in open\r\n             session in the Senate-House, approved by the Governor of the\r\n             state, and duly deposited in the office of the secretary of state, it\r\n             is sufficient evidence, nothing to the contrary appearing upon\r\n             its face, that it passed the General Assembly, and that it is not\r\n             competent either by the journals of the two houses, or either of\r\n             them, or by any other evidence, to impeach such an act. And\r\n             this being so, it follows that the court is not at liberty to inquire\r\n             into what the journals of the two houses may show as to the\r\n             successive steps which may have been taken in the passage of\r\n             the original bill.\r\n\ndid not have the opportunity to vote on the Governor's veto since the House did not\r\noverride it. This procedure is mandated by our Constitution, which operates in the\r\nsame manner whenever there is a gubernatorial veto, that is, the vetoed bill is\r\nreturned first to the chamber where it originated. Only if that body votes to\r\noverride the veto by a two-thirds majority does the other chamber have the\r\nopportunity to consider the veto. S.C. Const. art. IV, § 21. I simply do not\r\nunderstand why the majority finds \"great significance\" in the fact the Constitution's\r\nprocedure was honored here.\r\n\r\nWe have recently held that if an appropriations veto is lawful (and there is no\r\nchallenge to the veto here) and the veto is not overridden (and there is no challenge\r\nto the House vote), then \"there is no longer any authority to expend state funds for\r\nthe purpose stated on the line.\" Jackson v. Sanford, supra; see also State ex rel.\r\nLong, supra. I believe that the majority and I agree on the meaning of this rule:\r\nthere can be no funding for the CON program during fiscal year 2013-2014 unless\r\nand until the General Assembly appropriates funds for this purpose. See Singer &\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The court gives the following reasons for the adoption of\r\n             the enrolled bill rule: 'Public policy, certainty as to what the law\r\n             is, convenience, and that respect due by the courts to the\r\n             wisdom and integrity of the Legislature, a co-ordinate branch of\r\n             the government, all require that the enrolled bill, when fair upon\r\n             its face, should be accepted without question by the courts.'\r\n\r\n             ...\r\n\r\n             Having been properly authenticated as required by the\r\n             Constitution, it becomes the \"sole expository of its own\r\n             contents and the conclusive evidence of its existence and valid\r\n             enactment,\" and this court cannot look to the Journals of either\r\n             House or to other extraneous evidence in order to ascertain its\r\n             history or its provisions, or to inquire into the manner of its\r\n             enactment.\r\n\r\n             State ex rel. Coleman v. Lewis, 181 S.C. 10, 19-20, 186 S.E.\r\n             625, 629 (1936) (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\nThere is no legal basis for an inquiry into \"intent\" here.\r\n\nSinger 1 Southerland Statutory Constr. § 16:9 (2010) (if gubernatorial\r\nappropriation veto not overridden, legislature may reenact a separate\r\nappropriations act).\r\n\r\nI know of no authority that would permit this Court to order DHEC to fund the\r\nCON program in the face of the House's failure to override the Governor's line\r\nitem veto. Such interference with the prerogatives given to the executive and the\r\nlegislature under our Constitution is a clear violation of the separation of powers\r\ndoctrine. Compare Hampton v. Haley, 403 S.C. 395, 743 S.E.2d 258 (2013)\r\n(allowing executive agency to decline to spend legislatively appropriated funds\r\nbased on its own policy choices would violate the doctrine). Further, to read the\r\nproviso in Part IB, § 117.9, which permits agencies to redistribute appropriated\r\nfunds, as does the majority, negates the Governor's line item veto authority and\r\nundermines our constitutional system. Under the majority's reading, an agency is\r\nfree to ignore the will of the Governor as expressed through her veto, and that of\r\nthe General Assembly in sustaining that veto, and may spend money as it sees fit.\r\nThe majority cites no authority to support its construction of this proviso,10 and I\r\nwill be surprised if there were any as such a reading would effectively negate the\r\nGovernor's veto authority. Finally, if it were true that DHEC could revive the\r\ndormant CON program simply by raising fees through its emergency regulatory\r\nauthority, then any rogue agency could operate in defiance of the Constitution\r\nwhich gives the Governor and the General Assembly the authority to suspend the\r\noperation of a program by line item veto and subsequent vote.\r\n\r\nI agree with the majority that the CON program continues to exist despite the\r\nGovernor's veto and the House's failure to override that veto, and that its statutory\r\nand regulatory requirements must be met before one may proceed with a regulated\r\nactivity. However, until funding for this program is reinstated by the General\r\nAssembly, no new matters can be initiated and all pending matters are in limbo.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, I respectfully dissent from the majority's finding that\r\nthe Court can order DHEC to fund the CON program.\r\n\r\n  Since this proviso does not \"specify objects and purposes\" nor \"appropriate\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nseveral amounts in distinct items and sections,\" it is not subject to the Governor's\r\nveto authority. S.C. Const. art. IV, § 21; Florida Senate v. Harris, 750 So.2d 626\r\n(Fla. 1999). Under the majority's view, the inclusion of this \"unvetoable\" proviso\r\nin an appropriations bill which is included only to satisfy the terms of S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 11-9-10) gives entities receiving funds under that bill free reign to spend\r\nthose monies as they see fit.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27383","title":"Johnson v.

In each cause of action in his complaint,\r\npetitioner asserted he was entitled to an order directing he be removed from the\r\nregistry. At the declaratory judgment hearing, petitioner argued he was entitled to\r\nrelief because the requirement that he register as a sex offender was\r\nunconstitutional, and he was entitled to the equitable relief of being removed from\r\nthe registry. The State did not argue petitioner had not pled equitable relief or that\r\nhe was not entitled to equitable relief. The trial court declined to grant petitioner\r\nrelief on the constitutional claims, but concluded petitioner was entitled to\r\nequitable relief, finding \"[u]nder the facts of the Plaintiff's case, the requirements\r\nof life long Sex Offender Registry is wildly disproportionate to the underlying\r\nconduct.\"\r\n\r\nThe State filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgment, but\r\ndid not raise the issue that petitioner failed to argue equitable relief and therefore\r\nwas not entitled to equitable relief.

If the Court determines the Act is effective, petitioner requests\r\nthe South Carolina State Election Commission (the Commission) be ordered to\r\nconduct a Libertarian Party primary on June 10, 2014, and place a referendum\r\nquestion on the primary ballot for approval of the use of the convention method of\r\nnominating candidates by petitioner in 2016. We grant the petition for original\r\njurisdiction and declare the Act is in effect. We deny petitioner's request to require\r\nthe Commission to conduct a Libertarian Party primary and place a referendum\r\nquestion on the primary ballot.            FACTS\r\n\r\nOn June 13, 2013, the Governor signed the Act. The Act amended S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 7-11-30 to allow political parties to nominate candidates by convention if:\r\n\r\n      (1) there is a three-fourths vote of the total membership of the convention to\r\nuse the convention nomination process; and\r\n\r\n       (2) a majority of voters in that party's next primary election approve the use\r\nof the convention nomination process.\r\n\r\nSection 14 of the Act provides that the Act will take effect \"upon preclearance by\r\nthe United States Department of Justice or approval by a declaratory judgment\r\nissued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, whichever\r\noccurs first.\"\r\n\r\nPetitioner is a certified political party in South Carolina that, in the past, has\r\nnominated its candidates by the convention method. In a letter to the Commission,\r\ndated January 11, 2014, petitioner requested that the Commission hold a\r\nLibertarian Party primary on June 10, 2014, and place a question on the primary\r\nballot to approve the use of a convention nomination process in 2016. The\r\nCommission refused petitioner's request.\r\n\r\n                              QUESTIONS PRESENTED\r\n\r\nI.       Is the Act currently in effect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   2013 S.C. Act No. 61.\r\n\nII.   If the Act is in effect, is the Commission required to conduct a Libertarian\r\nParty primary and place a referendum on the primary ballot to approve the use of\r\nthe convention method by petitioner in 2016?\r\n\r\n                                    ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Effective Date of the Act\r\n\r\nAt the time the Act was approved by the General Assembly, the Voting Rights Act\r\nrequired certain jurisdictions to receive preclearance of any change in their election\r\nlaws by the United States Department of Justice or by a declaratory judgment by\r\nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia to ensure the change\r\nwas not discriminatory. South Carolina was one of the jurisdictions subject to that\r\nmandate. Because of this preclearance requirement, the General Assembly\r\ninserted Section 14 in the Act to require preclearance by the Federal Government\r\nfor the Act to take effect.\r\n\r\nThis Court has recognized the authority of the General Assembly to place a\r\ncontingency on the effective date of a statute.

Lewis, 181\r\nS.C. 10, 29, 186 S.E. 625, 633 (1936) (\"Where an act is clothed with all the forms\r\nof law, and is complete in and of itself, it is fairly within the scope of the\r\nlegislative power to prescribe that it shall become operative only on the happening\r\nof some specified contingency. Such a statute lies dormant until called into active\r\nforce by the existence of the conditions on which it is intended to operate.\")\r\n\r\nIn Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. 2612 (2013), the United States\r\nSupreme Court held the provision setting forth the coverage formula of the Voting\r\nRights Act was unconstitutional and could no longer be used as a basis for\r\nsubjecting certain jurisdictions (designated as covered jurisdictions, such as South\r\nCarolina) to preclearance by the Federal Government. As a result of the Shelby\r\nCounty opinion, the requirement that South Carolina obtain preclearance from the\r\nFederal Government was eliminated. Because the General Assembly's intent in\r\nmaking preclearance a contingency for the Act to become effective was to comply\r\nwith the then-mandatory provisions of the Voting Rights Act, and the Shelby\r\nCounty decision obviated the need for that compliance, the contingency placed on\r\nthe Act in section 14 has been met. See Beaufort Cnty. v. S.C. State Election\r\nComm'n, 395 S.C. 366, 718 S.E.2d 432 (2011) (the primary rule of statutory\r\nconstruction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the General Assembly).\r\nAccordingly, the Act became effective on June 25, 2013, the date the United States\r\nSupreme Court issued its opinion in Shelby County.\r\n\nII.   Primary and Referendum to Approve Use of the Convention Method\r\n\r\nPetitioner has always nominated its candidates by the convention method.\r\nBelieving the amendment to section 7-11-30 in the Act required it to determine its\r\nnominations by the primary method before returning to the convention method,\r\npetitioner requested the Commission hold a Libertarian Party primary on June 10,\r\n2014. Petitioner also asked the Commission to place a referendum on the primary\r\nballot to allow petitioner to nominate by convention in 2016. The Commission\r\nrefused to comply with petitioner's requests. Petitioner now asks the Court to\r\nrequire the Commission to conduct a Libertarian Party primary and place a\r\nreferendum on that ballot to approve the use of the convention method. We deny\r\nthis request.\r\n\r\nBased on well-established rules of statutory construction, we conclude that the\r\nGeneral Assembly intended the new requirement of a primary referendum in\r\nsection 7-11-30 to apply only to parties seeking to abandon the open primary\r\nmethod of nominating candidates in favor of the closed convention method. See\r\nGreenville Cnty. Republican Party Executive Comm. v. S.C., 824 F. Supp. 2d 655\r\n(D.S.C. 2011). Because petitioner has always utilized the convention method of\r\nnominating candidates, the Act does not require petitioner to adopt a primary\r\nnomination process in order to retain its convention method of nomination.\r\nAccordingly, we deny petitioner's request to require the Commission to conduct a\r\nLibertarian Party primary on June 10, 2014, and include a referendum on that\r\nballot approving the use of the convention method in 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27385","title":"In the Interest of Jane Doe","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27385.pdf","description":"Jane Doe (\"Appellant\") appeals the family court's order declaring her to be a \"vulnerable adult\" and in need of protective services pursuant to the South Carolina Omnibus Adult Protection Act.

Code Ann. §§ 43-35-5 to -595 (Supp. 2013).\r\n\nDoe contends the South Carolina Department of Social Services (\"DSS\") failed to\r\nprove that she is a vulnerable adult3 at substantial risk of neglect4 due solely to her\r\nadvanced age. Doe seeks reversal of the family court's order so that she may be\r\nreleased from involuntary protective custody and returned to her home. Because\r\nwe find that Doe did not meet the statutory definition of a vulnerable adult under\r\nthe Act, we reverse. However, because there may have been significant changes to\r\nDoe's physical and mental health and to the condition of Doe's home during the\r\npendency of this appeal, we remand the case in order for the family court to\r\nconduct a review hearing to assess the current status of Doe's case.\r\n\r\n                         I.    Factual / Procedural History\r\n\r\n       In 1993, the General Assembly promulgated the Act to establish a system to\r\nprotect vulnerable adults in South Carolina from abuse, neglect, and exploitation.\r\nAct No. 110, § 1, 1993 S.C. Acts 257. The Act is intended to address the\r\ncontinuing needs of vulnerable adults and to provide services in the least restrictive\r\nsetting possible. S.C. Code Ann. § 43-35-5 (Supp. 2013); Williams v. Watkins, 379\r\nS.C. 530, 665 S.E.2d 243 (Ct. App. 2008). The Act identifies the appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3   The Act defines a \"vulnerable adult\" as:\r\n\r\n        [A] person eighteen years of age or older who has a physical or\r\n        mental condition which substantially impairs the person from\r\n        adequately providing for his or her own care or protection. This\r\n        includes a person who is impaired in the ability to adequately provide\r\n        for the person's own care or protection because of the infirmities of\r\n        aging including, but not limited to, organic brain damage, advanced\r\n        age, and physical, mental, or emotional dysfunction. A resident of a\r\n        facility is a vulnerable adult.\r\n\r\nId. § 43-35-10(11) (emphasis added).\r\n4 The Act defines \"neglect\" to include \"the inability of a vulnerable adult, in the\r\nabsence of a caretaker, to provide for his or her own health or safety which\r\nproduces or could reasonably be expected to produce serious physical or\r\npsychological harm or substantial risk of death.\" Id. § 43-35-10(6).\r\n\ninvestigative entities5 and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the agencies\r\ninvolved in the system. Id. §§ 43-35-15 to -20. The Act further provides\r\nprocedures for reporting, investigating, and adjudicating criminal and noncriminal\r\nallegations of adult abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Id. §§ 43-35-25 to -85.\r\n\r\n       On July 31, 2012, pursuant to the Act, deputies with the Richland County\r\nSheriff's Department investigated a report6 involving Doe, an eighty-six-year-old\r\nwoman who lives alone, is without family support, and suffers from a heart\r\ncondition.7 When they arrived, Doe refused to allow the deputies to enter her\r\nhome and, in fact, had barricaded the windows and the doors for \"security\r\npurposes.\" The deputies, however, were able to observe that the home was \"in an\r\nunsanitary and deplorable condition.\" Specifically, the deputies noticed a hole in\r\nthe roof and that there was a hose running from Doe's home to a neighbor's home,\r\nwhich provided the only source of water. As they peered through the windows of\r\nDoe's home, the deputies saw mold on the window curtains and piles of items on\r\nthe floor giving the appearance that Doe was a \"hoarder.\" Based on their\r\ninvestigation, the deputies placed Doe in emergency protective custody and\r\ntransported her to the hospital.8\r\n\r\n5 Id. § 43-35-10(5) (\" 'Investigative entity' means \"the Long Term Care\r\nOmbudsman Program, the Adult Protective Services Program in the Department of\r\nSocial Services, the Vulnerable Adults Investigations Unit of the South Carolina\r\nLaw Enforcement Division, or the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Office of\r\nthe Attorney General.\").\r\n6 It is unclear who contacted the Richland County Sheriff's Department; however,\r\nsuch voluntary reporting is permissible as the Act not only provides for mandatory\r\nreporting, but also states that \"any other person who has reason to believe that a\r\nvulnerable adult has been or may be abused, neglected, or exploited may report the\r\nincident.\" Id. § 43-35-25(B).\r\n7  Id. § 43-35-55(A) (\"A law enforcement officer may take a vulnerable adult in a\r\nlife-threatening situation into protective custody if: (1) there is probable cause to\r\nbelieve that by reason of abuse, neglect, or exploitation there exists an imminent\r\ndanger to the vulnerable adult's life or physical safety; (2) the vulnerable adult or\r\ncaregiver does not consent to protective custody; and (3) there is not time to apply\r\nfor a court order.\").\r\n8 Id. § 43-35-55(B) (\"When a law enforcement officer takes protective custody of\r\na vulnerable adult, the officer must transport the vulnerable adult to a place of\r\n\n      Immediately thereafter, the Richland County Sheriff's Department notified\r\nthe Adult Protective Services Program of DSS in Richland County regarding its\r\ndecision to remove Doe from her home.9 On August 1, 2012, DSS filed a petition\r\nin family court10 seeking a determination that Doe was a vulnerable adult within\r\nthe meaning of the Act because, as a consequence of the condition of her home,\r\nshe was in substantial danger of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Because DSS\r\nbelieved Doe was in need of protective services,11 it requested the court grant\r\nprotective custody of Doe to DSS.\r\n\r\n      The same day, the family court held a hearing on the petition. On August 7,\r\n2012, the court issued a 72-Hour-Hearing Order12 wherein it found there was\r\n\r\n\r\nsafety which must not be a facility for the detention of criminal offenders or of\r\npersons accused of crimes. The Adult Protective Services Program has custody of\r\nthe vulnerable adult pending the family court hearing to determine if there is\r\nprobable cause for protective custody.\").\r\n9 Id. § 43-35-55(D) (\"When a law enforcement officer takes protective custody of\r\na vulnerable adult under this section, the law enforcement officer must\r\nimmediately notify the Adult Protective Services Program and the Department of\r\nSocial Services in the county where the vulnerable adult was situated at the time of\r\nbeing taken into protective custody.\").\r\n10 Id. § 43-35-55(E) (\"The Department of Social Services is responsible for filing a\r\npetition for protective custody within one business day of receiving the notification\r\nrequired by subsection (D).\").\r\n11  Id. § 43-35-10(9) (\" 'Protective services' means those services whose objective\r\nis to protect a vulnerable adult from harm caused by the vulnerable adult or\r\nanother. These services include, but are not limited to, evaluating the need for\r\nprotective services, securing and coordinating existing services, arranging for\r\nliving quarters, obtaining financial benefits to which a vulnerable adult is entitled,\r\nand securing medical services, supplies, and legal services.\").\r\n12 Id. § 43-35-55(F) (\"The family court shall hold a hearing to determine whether\r\nthere is probable cause for the protective custody within seventy-two hours of the\r\nDepartment of Social Services filing the petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays,\r\nand legal holidays.\").\r\n\nprobable cause for law enforcement to take Doe into emergency protective\r\ncustody. The court also scheduled a merits hearing for September 6, 2012 and\r\nordered a guardian ad litem (GAL) to be appointed for Doe as well as counsel for\r\nboth Doe and the GAL. Additionally, the court ordered Doe's social security\r\nbenefits or her funds to be redirected to pay for her care at Carson's Community\r\nCare Home where DSS had placed Doe.13\r\n\r\n       After granting four continuances, the family court held a merits hearing on\r\nMarch 25, 2013.14 At the hearing, DSS presented the report of Dr. Marc Harari, a\r\nlicensed counseling psychologist, who evaluated Doe on March 21, 2013. Based\r\non his assessment, Dr. Harari concluded that Doe possessed a \"sound mental\r\nstatus\" as Doe was logical and coherent in her responses, fully oriented and in\r\ncontact with reality, exhibited excellent long-term memory skills, and was fully\r\naware of the situational circumstances resulting in the involvement of DSS. He\r\nalso assessed Doe's cognitive ability to be within the \"Low-Average range.\"\r\nAlthough Doe demonstrated some hearing problems, Dr. Harari found she\r\nresponded appropriately when the examiner and testing assistant spoke loudly.\r\nDr. Harari, however, reported that Doe underwent open heart surgery in 2003,\r\ncontinues to receive medical treatment to address cardiac functioning, and takes\r\nmedication for arthritis and eye problems. Dr. Harari did not discern that Doe had\r\nany obvious mental health issues other than situational anxiety related to her desire\r\nto resume living at home.\r\n\r\n       Ultimately, Dr. Harari concluded that Doe appeared to have \"the minimum\r\nlevels of competency to function independently\" as there was no evidence of\r\ndementia, severe emotional issues, or obvious physical limitations. Despite this\r\nconclusion, Dr. Harari noted his concerns regarding Doe's self-admitted lack of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13 Id. § 43-35-45(I) (\"If the court determines that the vulnerable adult is financially\r\ncapable of paying for services ordered pursuant to this section, then payment by or\r\nfrom the financial resources of the vulnerable adult may be ordered.\").\r\n14 Despite the Act's mandate that the family court hold a hearing on the merits\r\nwithin forty days of the petition being filed, more than seven months elapsed in\r\nthis case due to the continuances granted. See id. § 43-35-45(C) (stating that\r\n\"within forty days of the petition being filed the court shall hold a hearing on the\r\nmerits\"). We note, however, that Doe's counsel either initiated or consented to the\r\nissuance of each order.\r\n\nfinances needed to repair her home, her limited social support system other than\r\nmembers of her church and a neighbor, and her need for continued medical\r\nmonitoring due to her medical conditions and advanced age. If the court\r\ndetermined that Doe could return home, Dr. Harari recommended that DSS\r\nmaintain an open treatment case to ensure Doe's home was repaired and that Doe\r\ninteracted with peers to alleviate Doe's feelings of isolation.\r\n\r\n       Although counsel for DSS acknowledged Dr. Harari's conclusion regarding\r\nDoe's competency, he emphasized Doe's advanced age, medical issues, and the\r\ncondition of Doe's home. Specifically, counsel noted that Doe had a minor heart\r\ncondition and hypertension, but conceded there is \"nothing in [the record] to\r\nindicate that chronic medical needs are not being addressed.\" Counsel also\r\nadmitted there was \"very little evidence to establish the threshold [determination]\r\nthat she's a vulnerable adult.\" Due to this \"scintilla of evidence,\" counsel stated he\r\nhad debated whether to ask the court to dismiss the petition filed by DSS.\r\n\r\n      In response, Doe's counsel disputed the claim that Doe qualifies as a\r\nvulnerable adult due solely to her advanced age because Doe had been deemed\r\ncompetent by Dr. Harari. Counsel also described Doe as a \"fiercely independent\"\r\nwoman who wanted to return to the home that she had lived in since 1967 and did\r\nnot want any of the services provided by DSS.\r\n\r\n       The GAL's counsel indicated that the GAL was reticent to make a\r\nrecommendation as to whether Doe met the statutory definition of a vulnerable\r\nadult given the lack of supporting evidence and limited case law interpreting the\r\nAct. However, counsel acknowledged that, pursuant to the Act, Doe would have to\r\nbe deemed a vulnerable adult in danger of neglect in order for DSS to provide Doe\r\nwith the necessary services to address her unfavorable living conditions.\r\n\r\n       When questioned by the court about the current state of her home, Doe\r\nreplied that the hole in the roof had been patched and there was no longer a leak in\r\nthe house. She further explained her water had been turned off due to a dispute\r\nwith the water company over an outstanding bill. However, Doe stated she had\r\nsince paid the bill and could now request to have the water turned back on. DSS\r\ncould not confirm the current state of Doe's home because Doe had refused to let\r\nthe caseworker enter the home and DSS had not procured an inspection warrant.15\r\n\r\n15 Id. § 43-35-45(A) (\"In investigating a report if consent cannot be obtained for\r\naccess to the vulnerable adult or the premises, the investigative entity may seek a\r\n\n       On March 28, 2013, the court issued a written order that confirmed the oral\r\nruling delivered at the conclusion of the hearing. The court found Doe met the\r\nstatutory definition of a vulnerable adult because \"due to the infirmities of aging,\r\nshe cannot fully and completely provide for her own safety.\" The court noted that\r\nthe condition of Doe's home \"played a major role in her being taken into\r\nemergency protective custody.\" Although the court acknowledged Doe has the\r\n\"minimum levels of competency to function independently,\" it relied on Dr.\r\nHarari's finding that Doe requires medical monitoring given Doe's medical\r\nconditions and advanced age. Additionally, the court concluded Doe was in need\r\nof protective services based on Dr. Harari's suggestion of an open treatment case to\r\nensure that the essential repairs were made to Doe's home.\r\n\r\n       As a result of these findings, the court ordered DSS to provide Doe with the\r\nnecessary services to make Doe's home habitable. Specifically, the court ordered\r\nfor: (1) the water supply to be reconnected; (2) the house to be \"subjectively\r\nclean,\" which meant \"clean within a reasonable degree\" not necessarily \"perfectly\r\nclean\"; (3) electrical power to be supplied, if not already, to the house; (4) the\r\nheating system to be operational; (5) an air conditioning system, if in place, to be\r\noperational; and (6) the house to have adequate food and cleaning supplies. The\r\ncourt instructed that Doe should remain in the custody of DSS until each item had\r\nbeen completed. Upon completion, Doe could return home but DSS was ordered\r\nto \"monitor the home in compliance with its policy.\" Finally, the court scheduled\r\na hearing on June 20, 2013, at which time the court would review the progress of\r\nthe home repairs and determine whether Doe was financially capable of paying for\r\nthe ordered services.\r\n\r\n       After Doe appealed to the Court of Appeals, the appeal was certified to this\r\nCourt pursuant to Rule 204(b) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules. As a\r\nresult of the notice of appeal being filed, the family court issued an order\r\ncontinuing the review hearing. See Rule 205, SCACR (\"Upon the service of the\r\nnotice of appeal, the appellate court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\nappeal.\").                  II.   Standard of Review\r\n\r\nwarrant from the family court to enter and inspect and photograph the premises and\r\nthe condition of the vulnerable adult. The court shall issue a warrant upon a\r\nshowing of probable cause that the vulnerable adult has been abused, neglected, or\r\nexploited or is at risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation.\").\r\n\n       \"The family court is a court of equity.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386,\r\n709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). In appeals from the family court, the appellate court\r\nreviews factual and legal issues de novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414,\r\n709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). \"De novo review permits appellate court fact-finding,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of evidence supporting the [family] court's findings.\"\r\nLewis, 392 S.C. at 390, 709 S.E.2d at 654-55. \"However, we recognize this broad\r\nscope of review does not alter the fact that a family court is better able to make\r\ncredibility determinations because it has the opportunity to observe the witnesses.\"\r\nWilburn v. Wilburn, 403 S.C. 372, 380, 743 S.E.2d 734, 738 (2013). Additionally,\r\nthe de novo standard does not relieve the appellant of the burden of identifying\r\nerror in the family court's findings.\" Id. Accordingly, this Court will affirm the\r\ndecision of the family court unless the decision is controlled by an error of law or\r\nthe appellant satisfies the burden of showing the preponderance of the evidence\r\nactually supports contrary factual findings by the appellate court. Id.; DiMarco v.\r\nDiMarco, 399 S.C. 295, 299, 731 S.E.2d 617, 619 (Ct. App. 2012).\r\n\r\n                                 III.   Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Arguments\r\n\r\n       Doe contends the family court erred in classifying her as a vulnerable adult\r\nand ordering her continued custody with DSS until the completion of the itemized\r\nprotective services. In support of this contention, Doe claims DSS failed to prove\r\nthat she is a vulnerable adult as there is no evidence she has a physical or mental\r\ncondition that substantially impairs her ability to care for and protect herself.\r\nRather, Doe asserts the sole basis for the family court's decision was her advanced\r\nage. Because advanced age alone is not sufficient to warrant the application of the\r\nAct, Doe seeks reversal of the family court's order.\r\n\r\n        Alternatively, Doe argues that even if she is deemed a vulnerable adult, there\r\nis no evidence that she was at substantial risk of being neglected. Specifically,\r\nDoe asserts DSS did not present any evidence regarding the condition of the home\r\nas it failed to procure an inspection warrant to enter the home. She notes the home\r\nconditions that precipitated her removal by DSS have been remedied as the leak in\r\nthe home has been fixed and she is able to have the water supply turned back on.\r\nFinally, Doe contends DSS \"offered no proof that a supposedly messy home\" put\r\nher at a substantial risk of neglect.\r\n\r\nB.    Analysis\r\n\n          1. Three-Part Analysis\r\n      In analyzing this appeal, the Court must answer the following three\r\nquestions: (1) was Doe a \"vulnerable adult\" under the Act; (2) if so, was she at\r\nsubstantial risk of being neglected due to this status; and, in turn, (3) were\r\nprotective services necessary to protect Doe from the substantial risk of neglect?\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 43-35-45(E) (Supp. 2013). In answering these questions, we\r\nreference the well-established rules of statutory construction.\r\n\r\n        \"The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nintention of the legislature.\" Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498, 640 S.E.2d 457,\r\n459 (2007). \"When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there\r\nis no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according\r\nto its literal meaning.\" Id. In interpreting a statute, \"[w]ords must be given their\r\nplain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit\r\nor expand the statute's operation.\" Id. at 499, 640 S.E.2d at 459. Further, \"the\r\nstatute must be read as a whole and sections which are a part of the same general\r\nstatutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.\" S.C. State\r\nPorts Auth. v. Jasper Cnty., 368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629 (2006).\r\n\r\n       \"If the statute is ambiguous . . . courts must construe the terms of the\r\nstatute.\" Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 342, 713 S.E.2d 278, 283\r\n(2011) (citation omitted). The statutory language must be construed in light of the\r\nintended purpose of the statute. Id. This Court will not construe a statute in a way\r\nwhich leads to an absurd result or renders it meaningless. See Lancaster Cnty. Bar\r\nAss'n v. S.C. Comm'n on Indigent Defense, 380 S.C. 219, 222, 670 S.E.2d 371, 373\r\n(2008) (\"In construing a statute, this Court will reject an interpretation when such\r\nan interpretation leads to an absurd result that could not have been intended by the\r\nlegislature.\").\r\n\r\n          2. General Definition of a \"Vulnerable Adult\"\r\n\r\n      Cognizant of the above-outlined rules, we turn to the text of the Act, which\r\ndefines a \"vulnerable adult\" as:\r\n\r\n      [A] person eighteen years of age or older who has a physical or\r\n      mental condition which substantially impairs the person from\r\n      adequately providing for his or her own care or protection. This\r\n      includes a person who is impaired in the ability to adequately provide\r\n      for the person's own care or protection because of the infirmities of\r\n\n      aging including, but not limited to, organic brain damage, advanced\r\n      age, and physical, mental, or emotional dysfunction. A resident of a\r\n      facility is a vulnerable adult.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 43-35-10(11) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added). By its clear terms,\r\nthe infirmities of aging must \"substantially impair\" the person's ability to\r\nadequately provide for his or her own care or protection. Because the Act does not\r\ndefine \"impair,\" we have looked to the ordinary meaning of the word. \"Impair\"\r\nmeans \"to make worse by or as if by diminishing in some material respect.\"\r\nMerriam-Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 569 (8th ed. 1981). In disability\r\nlaw, \"severe impairment\" is defined as \"a physical or mental impairment that\r\ngreatly restricts a person's ability to perform ordinary, necessary tasks of daily\r\nlife.\" Black's Law Dictionary 819 (9th ed. 2009). Thus, we hold for a person to be\r\ndeemed a vulnerable adult under the Act the person's physical or mental condition,\r\nincluding advanced age, must cause a diminished ability to adequately provide for\r\nself-care or protection.\r\n\r\n       Although our research revealed no cases directly on point in South Carolina\r\nor other jurisdictions, there are cases in analogous contexts that support this\r\ninterpretation of a vulnerable adult. Specifically, we have looked for guidance in\r\nthose cases where the term \"vulnerable adult\" was analyzed for the appointment of\r\na conservatorship, the basis of a civil suit for the exploitation of a vulnerable adult,\r\nand the basis of a criminal charge for the abuse or exploitation of a vulnerable\r\nadult. In cases where family members have petitioned for the imposition of a\r\nconservatorship for their elderly relative, the reviewing courts have required more\r\nthan evidence of advanced age. Rather, the courts have declined to order a\r\nconservatorship unless there is evidence that the subject's advanced age directly\r\naffected the ability to make decisions regarding the subject's property. See, e.g., In\r\nre the Conservatorship of Townsend, 809 N.W.2d 424, 429 (Mich. Ct. App. 2011)\r\n(reversing probate court's finding that petitioner's mother was a \"vulnerable adult\"\r\nas there was no evidence that mother had a \"mental, physical, or advanced-age\r\nrelated impairment\" that rendered her unable to say no to her family members\r\nregarding decisions involving her property); In re the Conservatorship of\r\nGoodman, 766 P.2d 1010 (Okla. Ct. App. 1988) (holding conservatorship could\r\nnot be constitutionally imposed over property of 86-year-old adult due to his\r\nadvanced age without a finding of mental incompetence); Endicott v. Saul, 176\r\nP.3d 560 (Wash. Ct. App. 2008) (affirming sons' petition to establish guardianship\r\nover their 80-year-old mother and finding mother was a \"vulnerable adult\" for\r\n\npurposes of Abuse of Vulnerable Adults Act where there was testimony that the\r\nmother could not independently manage her finances or take care of herself).\r\n\r\n       Similarly, in order to sustain a cause of action under state adult protective\r\nservices legislation, courts have required the party to present evidence that an\r\nelderly victim was unable to protect or care for himself due to a physical or mental\r\ncondition. See Davis v. Zlatos, 123 P.3d 1156, 1163 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2005)\r\n(holding, in a civil suit involving a violation of the Arizona Adult Protective\r\nServices Act, that elderly victim was a \"vulnerable adult\" because it was\r\nuncontested she was physically impaired and that \"[h]er ability to care for herself\r\nwas plainly lessened due to her age and health problems\"); Farr v. Searles, 910\r\nA.2d 929, 930 (Vt. 2006) (concluding plaintiff failed to prove she was a\r\n\"vulnerable adult\" for purposes of a civil suit as a \"mere listing of physical\r\nailments, which many people suffer, was not sufficient to establish that plaintiff\r\nwas unable to protect herself from abuse, neglect, or exploitation\").\r\n\r\n       In cases where the government has pursued a charge of abuse or exploitation\r\nof a vulnerable adult, courts have required the prosecution to present evidence that\r\nthe victim was unable to perform daily activities related to self-care or protection\r\nas a result of a physical or mental infirmity, including advanced age. See People v.\r\nCline, 741 N.W.2d 563 (Mich. Ct. App. 2007) (finding evidence was sufficient to\r\nsupport conviction for first-degree vulnerable adult abuse where victim qualified as\r\na vulnerable adult because she required some level of personal care as a result of\r\nblindness and diabetes and, thus, could not live independently); Decker v. State, 66\r\nSo. 3d 654, 658 (Miss. 2011) (recognizing that, in a case involving the prosecution\r\nfor a violation of the Vulnerable Adults Act, the broad definition of \"vulnerable\r\nadult\" included \"a person with completely normal mental capacity, but whose\r\nability to perform the normal activities of daily living is impaired because of a\r\nphysical limitation, such as blindness or the inability to walk\" (emphasis added));\r\nState v. Stubbs, 555 N.W.2d 55, 62 (Neb. Ct. App. 1996) (vacating conviction for\r\nexploitation of a vulnerable adult where evidence that victim was physically and\r\nmentally aging did not establish that the victim had \"substantial functional\r\nimpairment which left him incapable of caring for himself or living\r\nindependently\"), aff'd, 562 N.W.2d 547 (Neb. 1997). See generally James L.\r\nBuchwalter, Annotation, Validity, Construction, and Application of State Civil and\r\nCriminal Elder Abuse Laws, 113 A.L.R. 5th 431 (2003 & Supp. 2014) (analyzing\r\nstate and federal cases involving civil suits and criminal prosecution for elder\r\nabuse); William D. Bremer, Annotation, Vulnerability of Victim as Aggravating\r\nFactor under State Sentencing Guidelines, 73 A.L.R. 5th 383 (1999 & Supp. 2014)\r\n(analyzing state cases as to various aspects of vulnerability, such as age, that have\r\n\nbeen asserted in applying a state sentencing provision based on victim's\r\nvulnerability).\r\n\r\n          3. Determination of Whether Doe was a Vulnerable Adult\r\n       Utilizing the foregoing definition, we must next assess whether the family\r\ncourt erred in concluding that Doe was a vulnerable adult. This assessment is\r\nproblematic as the Act does not set forth the standard of proof necessary for this\r\ndetermination. Because the absence of a standard makes the analysis of this case\r\ndifficult and also implicates constitutional due process issues, we must determine\r\nand enunciate the requisite standard of proof.\r\n\r\n       Without question, an involuntary removal under the Act deprives a person of\r\nhis liberty as well as property if the court orders a vulnerable adult to pay for the\r\ncare received while in the custody of DSS. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (\"[N]or\r\nshall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process\r\nof law.\"); S.C. Const. art. I, § 3 (\"[N]or shall any person be deprived of life, liberty,\r\nor property without due process of law.\").\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, we conclude that a heightened standard of proof, i.e., clear and\r\nconvincing evidence, is necessary under these circumstances. See In re Knight,\r\n317 P.3d 1068 (Wash. Ct. App. 2014) (holding that standard of proof for a\r\nvulnerable adult protection order opposed by the alleged vulnerable adult is clear,\r\ncogent, and convincing evidence because the protection order implicates the\r\nvulnerable adult's liberty and autonomy interests). Notably, our General Assembly\r\nhas explicitly identified the clear and convincing standard of proof for the issuance\r\nof an involuntary commitment order involving a person who suffers from mental\r\nhealth issues. See S.C. Code Ann. § 44-17-580(A) (Supp. 2013) (requiring, in a\r\nproceeding for the involuntary commitment to a mental health facility, the court to\r\nfind by \"clear and convincing evidence that the person is mentally ill, needs\r\ninvoluntary treatment,\" and because of his condition lacks sufficient insight or\r\ncapacity to make responsible decisions with respect to his treatment or there is a\r\nlikelihood of serious harm to himself or others (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       Applying a clear and convincing standard of proof, we find DSS failed to\r\nprove that Doe was a vulnerable adult. Significantly, counsel for DSS admitted the\r\nevidence was \"scant\" and there was only a \"scintilla of evidence\" to show that Doe\r\nqualified as a vulnerable adult under the terms of the Act. Furthermore, there is no\r\nevidence that Doe's advanced age substantially impaired her ability to adequately\r\nprovide for her own care and protection. Specifically, there is no evidence of\r\nphysical or mental infirmities that would prohibit Doe from living independently.\r\n\nTo the contrary, the evaluating psychologist concluded Doe possessed a level of\r\ncompetency sufficient for her to function independently and she had no obvious\r\nphysical limitations. Moreover, there is no evidence the unfavorable home\r\ncondition that precipitated Doe's involuntary removal was causally related to her\r\nadvanced age. Instead, the problems with Doe's home were dependent on the\r\nfinances needed to repair the roof and turn on the water supply.16 Although there is\r\nsome evidence that Doe's home was in disarray, DSS offered no evidence\r\nattributing the lack of cleanliness to a deficiency in Doe's mental or physical\r\ncondition. Accordingly, we find the family court erred in classifying Doe as a\r\nvulnerable adult.\r\n\r\n      Because DSS failed to prove the threshold determination that Doe was a\r\nvulnerable adult, we need not address the remaining prongs of the three-part test.\r\nSpecifically, we need not determine whether Doe was at substantial risk of being\r\nneglected and whether protective services were necessary to protect Doe from the\r\nsubstantial risk of neglect. S.C. Code Ann. § 43-35-45(E) (Supp. 2013).17\r\n\r\n                                 IV.   Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16  We are cognizant of the fact that poverty or the lack of adequate funds or\r\nresources may have a deleterious effect on an individual's ability to adequately\r\nprovide for her care and protection; however, poverty alone is not sufficient to\r\nsatisfy the definition of a vulnerable adult under the Act. Rather, there must be\r\nevidence of other factors that cause the deleterious effect.\r\n17 In rejecting the majority's ultimate conclusion, the dissent takes issue with the\r\nmajority's construction of the Act. Specifically, the dissent claims the majority\r\n\"narrowly\" construes the term \"vulnerable adult\" and, in turn, fails to address\r\nwhether protective services were necessary to protect Doe from the substantial risk\r\nof neglect. The dissent, however, fails to appreciate the logical progression of the\r\nAct, which requires the Court to first determine whether DSS has established by\r\nclear and convincing evidence that Doe qualifies as a vulnerable adult pursuant to\r\nthe statutory definition in the Act. In fact, the dissent makes only a cursory\r\nreference to the clear and convincing standard of proof necessary to support the\r\ninvoluntary removal of an adult from their home. Because Doe has asked this\r\nCourt to interpret the Act, we cannot simply ignore the statutory language merely\r\nbecause there is evidence that Doe's living conditions were unfavorable at the time\r\nof her removal.\r\n\n       Although we believe the family court was well intentioned, we find that it\r\nerred in classifying Doe as a vulnerable adult under the Act. Specifically, there\r\nwas no evidence that Doe's advanced age impaired her ability to adequately\r\nprovide for her own care and protection. Without this threshold determination, the\r\ncourt erred in ordering Doe to remain in protective custody until the identified\r\nprotective services were completed. However, because there may have been\r\nsignificant changes to Doe's physical and mental health and to the condition of\r\nDoe's home during the pendency of this appeal, we remand the case in order for the\r\nfamily court to conduct a review hearing to assess the current status of Doe's case.\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we reverse the order of the family court and remand\r\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n      HEARN and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n    KITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: Because I do not construe the South Carolina Omnibus\r\nAdult Protection Act18 (Act) narrowly, I respectfully dissent. The dispositive\r\nquestion is whether Jane Doe, now eighty-eight years of age, is a \"vulnerable\r\nadult.\" By construing the term narrowly and finding Doe is not a vulnerable adult,\r\nthe majority does \"not address . . . whether protective services were necessary to\r\nprotect Doe from the substantial risk of neglect.\"\r\n\r\nI begin with the definition of a vulnerable adult:\r\n\r\n        [A] person eighteen years of age or older who has a physical or\r\n        mental condition which substantially impairs the person from\r\n        adequately providing for his or her own care or protection. This\r\n        includes a person who is impaired in the ability to adequately provide\r\n        for the person's own care or protection because of the infirmities of\r\n        aging including, but not limited to, organic brain damage, advanced\r\n        age, and physical, mental, or emotional dysfunction. A resident of a\r\n        facility is a vulnerable adult.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 43-35-10(11) (Supp. 2013). I believe the legislature defined the\r\nterm broadly, as evidenced by the \"including, but not limited to,\" language and the\r\nunmistakable purpose of the Act. I next observe that \"neglect\" is defined to\r\ninclude \"the inability of a vulnerable adult, in the absence of a caretaker, to provide\r\nfor his or her own health or safety which produces or could reasonably be expected\r\nto produce serious physical . . . harm.\" Id. § 43-35-10(6) (Supp. 2013). I also\r\nbelieve the circumstances and conditions that led to the taking of emergency\r\nprotective custody (EPC), which establish neglect, are relevant to the vulnerable\r\nadult determination.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 2012, law enforcement officers went to the home of Doe, then age 86.\r\nDoe, suffering from a heart condition, lived alone. Doe refused entry to the\r\nofficers. The doors and windows to the home were barricaded. The officers\r\nnoticed a hose running from a neighbor's home through a hole in the roof of Doe's\r\nhome. This was Doe's only source of water, for water service had been stopped for\r\nnonpayment. The inside of the home was, according to the officers, \"in an\r\nunsanitary and deplorable condition.\" There was mold present as well. The\r\nofficers placed Doe in EPC, and she was transported to the hospital. Doe does not\r\nchallenge the EPC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 43-35-5 to -595 (Supp. 2013).\r\n\nThe experienced and excellent family court judge considered the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, including the facts surrounding EPC, in finding Doe to be a\r\nvulnerable adult. The judge also carefully evaluated the entirety of testimony of\r\nDr. Marc Harari. In addition to Dr. Harari's testimony cited by the majority, the\r\njudge referenced Dr. Harari in finding \"that [Doe] would require medical\r\nmonitoring . . . [and] [i]n addition, [Dr. Harari] suggested that any open treatment\r\ncase, on a temporary basis, should contain a provision to ensure the necessary\r\nrepairs are made to the household so that [Doe] could reside in a suitable living\r\nenvironment.\" In urging an affirmance of the family court order, the guardian ad\r\nlitem (GAL) makes the common sense observation that \"[w]ithout . . . running\r\nwater, electricity, and adequate food it is hard to argue that any person would not\r\nbe at risk of 'neglect' within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. Section 43-35-10(6).\"\r\n(Br. of GAL at 9).\r\n\r\nMy view of the case is in line with that of the family court judge, who\r\nacknowledged Doe's mental abilities and sought a prompt return of Doe to her\r\nhome upon the completion of necessary repairs to make her home livable. I\r\nbelieve the vulnerable adult determination is supported by clear and convincing\r\nevidence, and I would affirm.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
