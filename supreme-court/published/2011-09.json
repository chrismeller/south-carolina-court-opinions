Eddy, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN: Thomas Skinner received an award of benefits from the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission for his asbestosis under the scheduled loss provisions\r\n  of Section 42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (1976 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â \r\n  Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Skinner's former employer, appeals that\r\n  decision, arguing Skinner cannot recover for a scheduled loss and must proceed\r\n  under the &quot;general disability&quot; statutes found in Sections 42-9-10 and\r\n  42-9-20 of the South Carolina Code (1976 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  We agree and\r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSkinner began working for\r\n  Westinghouse in 1968 and spent nearly fifteen years performing several\r\n  different jobs in its Hampton, South Carolina plant.Â  During the course of his\r\n  employment, Skinner was regularly exposed to and breathed in asbestos dust\r\n  contained in the insulation products produced at the plant as well as other\r\n  toxic chemicals.Â  In addition to his work with Westinghouse, Skinner joined the\r\n  South Carolina Army National Guard as a reservist in 1969, attending one drill\r\n  weekend a month and two drill weeks in the summer each year.Â  Furthermore, he worked\r\n  in the &quot;property book&quot; section of the National Guard, keeping\r\n  accounting records of government-owned property.Â  \r\nIn 1983, Skinner left\r\n  Westinghouse on his own accord, not because of any condition, medical or\r\n  otherwise, and began working full-time with the National Guard.Â  His salary\r\n  with the National Guard was over $44,000 per year, which was more than he was\r\n  making at Westinghouse.Â  He held that position until 1990, when he became a\r\n  unit administrator for the Bamberg unit.Â  As of 2005, he was still working\r\n  full-time with the National Guard as an administrator for the Hampton unit.[1]\r\nSkinner began having\r\n  noticeable breathing problems while he was employed at Westinghouse.Â  His\r\n  breathing problems became more pronounced in the early 1990s, when he was working\r\n  full-time with the National Guard.Â  At that time, an army doctor diagnosed him\r\n  with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Â  Skinner continued to have\r\n  breathing problems, and a pulmonary function test performed in 1998 showed a\r\n  worsening of his lung function.Â  Dr. Cary E. Fechter, a board-certified\r\n  pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist, evaluated Skinner in 2003 and\r\n  diagnosed him with asbestosis, occupational bronchitis, severe sleep apnea, and\r\n  sinusitis.Â  Additionally, medical records for the hospital where Skinner\r\n  received his general medical care stated he had COPD and asbestosis in both\r\n  lungs.\r\nSkinner filed a claim against\r\n  Westinghouse with the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission in 2004, alleging\r\n  he suffered an accidental injury to his lungs and whole body in 2003, caused by\r\n  chronic inhalation of asbestos fibers, chemical fumes, and other injurious\r\n  airborne contaminants.Â  Skinner claimed this injury led to partial general\r\n  disability and partial specific disability.Â  Although Skinner was the only\r\n  witness to testify at the hearing, the parties submitted the depositions of\r\n  several doctors, including Dr. Fechter who claimed Skinner had a combined\r\n  impairment of 64% of the whole person.Â  \r\nThe Commissioner found\r\n  Skinner suffered from an occupational disease and an injury by accident, was\r\n  partially disabled, and was able to recover under section 42-9-30.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the Commissioner awarded Skinner a lump sum amount of $119,159.66. Â Westinghouse\r\n  appealed this decision to the Appellate Panel of the Commission, which affirmed\r\n  the Commissioner's order. Â Westinghouse then appealed to the circuit court,\r\n  which dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  This Court\r\n  reversed that decision and remanded the appeal back to the circuit court. See\r\n    Skinner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 380 S.C. 91, 97, 668 S.E.2d 795, 798\r\n  (2008).Â  The circuit court referred the matter to a special referee, who held a\r\n  hearing and summarily affirmed the Commission's findings.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\nWestinghouse raises\r\n  two issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Does Section 42-11-60 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (1985) bar a claimant with pulmonary disease from recovering\r\n  workers' compensation disability benefits if he cannot show lost wages?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Does Section 42-11-70 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (1985) bar a claimant with pulmonary disease from recovering\r\n  benefits if he is not disabled within two years of the exposure to the\r\n  substance that caused the disease? \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWestinghouse's arguments on\r\n  appeal concern the impact of section 42-11-60 on Skinner's right to recover for\r\n  his pulmonary disease.Â  In particular, it argues Skinner can only recover for\r\n  total or partial disability under sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20, respectively.Â \r\n  Westinghouse therefore contends the Commissioner erred in finding Skinner's\r\n  injuries to be compensable as a scheduled loss under section 42-9-30.Â  Our review\r\n  is limited to deciding whether the Commission's decision is unsupported by\r\n  substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law. See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(d) (Supp. 2010); Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C.\r\n  80, 84, 610 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2005).Â  We agree with Westinghouse.\r\nSection 42-11-10(D) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (1985) generally allows for compensation to be paid to an\r\n  employee with an occupational disease who suffers from a disability under\r\n  sections 42-9-10, 42-9-20, or 42-9-30.Â  Section 42-11-10(B)(5) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) exempts from the definition of occupational disease &quot;any\r\n  disease of the cardiac, pulmonary, or circulatory system.&quot; Â However, this\r\n  subsection also contains an exception to this exception applicable to Skinner's\r\n  claim: if the pulmonary disease results from &quot;the natural entrance into\r\n    the body through the skin or natural orifices thereof of foreign organic\r\n      or inorganic matter under circumstances peculiar to the employment and the processes utilized therein,&quot; then it is an occupational disease. Id. (emphasis added).Â  In Skinner's case, his asbestosis was caused by the\r\n  inhalation of asbestos dust.Â  It is undisputed that asbestos dust was prevalent\r\n  in his work conditions at Westinghouse due to the particular products it\r\n  manufactured, and thus, it was peculiar to his employment.Â  Therefore, Skinner's\r\n  asbestosis is an occupational disease under the statute.\r\nHowever, &quot;[n]o\r\n  compensation shall be payable for any pulmonary disease arising out of the\r\n  inhalation of organic or inorganic dust or fumes unless the claimant suffers\r\n  disability as described in Â§ 42-9-10 or Â§ 42-9-20 and shall not be compensable\r\n  under Â§ 42-9-30.&quot; Id. Â§ 42-11-60 (1985).Â  Because section 42-11-60\r\n  is the specific statute governing compensability for pulmonary disease, it\r\n  controls over the more general language of 42-11-10(D). See Langley v.\r\n    Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 403, 438 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1993) (citing Lloyd v.\r\n      Lloyd, 295 S.C. 55, 57-58, 367 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1988)) (&quot;Generally,\r\n  specific laws prevail over general laws and later legislation takes precedence\r\n  over earlier legislation.&quot;).Â  It is uncontested that COPD and asbestosis\r\n  are pulmonary diseases.Â  Therefore, in order for Skinner to be compensated, he must\r\n  proceed under sections 42-9-10 or 42-9-20, not section 42-9-30.Â Â  \r\nSections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20\r\n  are commonly known as the &quot;general disability statutes,&quot; with section\r\n  42-9-10 governing total disability and section 42-9-20 governing partial\r\n  disability.Â  Both parties concede that Skinner's claim falls under the partial\r\n  disability statute.Â  Under section 42-9-20, lost wages must be shown in order\r\n  to receive compensation. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1985) (stating that an employee\r\n  with partial disability receives &quot;a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six\r\n  and two-thirds percent of the difference between his average weekly wages\r\n    before the injury and the average weekly wages which he is able to earn\r\n    thereafter, but not more than the average weekly wage in this State for the\r\n  preceding fiscal year&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  &quot;It is well-settled that\r\n  an award under the general disability statutes must be predicated upon a\r\n  showing of a loss of earning capacity, whereas an award under the scheduled\r\n  loss statute does not require such a showing.&quot; Fields v. Owens Corning\r\n    Fiberglas, 301 S.C. 554, 555, 393 S.E.2d 172, 173 (1990) (citing Roper\r\n      v. Kimbrell's of Greenville, Inc., 231 S.C. 453, 461, 99 S.E.2d 52, 56-57\r\n  (1957)).Â  \r\nWithout question, Skinner has\r\n  established that he suffers from an occupational disease.Â Â  However, because\r\n  his asbestosis is a pulmonary disease, it is not compensable under section 42-9-30,\r\n  and is only compensable under section 42-9-20, which requires a showing of lost\r\n  wages.Â  Skinner's workers compensation claim fails because he cannot establish\r\n  any lost wages occasioned by his asbestosis.Â  In fact, the only evidence of Skinner's\r\n  wages established that he was making more money with the National Guard than he\r\n  did when he was employed by Westinghouse.Â  Because he is unable to prove lost\r\n  wages, we find that Skinner cannot recover under section 42-9-20, and as a\r\n  result, does not have a compensable occupational disease.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the special\r\n  referee's affirmance of Skinner's award based upon the clear language of\r\n  section 42-11-60.Â  In that section, the General Assembly specified that\r\n  recovery for a pulmonary disease such as Skinner's hinges upon a showing of\r\n  lost wages under section 42-9-10 and 42-9-20.Â  Because our resolution of this\r\n  issue is dispositive of the appeal, it is not necessary for us to address the\r\n  remaining issues raised by the parties. See Futch v. McAlister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n  (determining that once an appellate court has addressed an issue that is\r\n  dispositive to the case, it is unnecessary to address any remaining issues). \r\nREVERSED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nPLEICONES, ACTING CHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Under the National Guard's rules, Skinner would reach\r\n  his mandatory retirement age in September 2006.Â  We assume that he retired as\r\n  planned at that time.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27038","title":"McClurg v.

Deaton, 380 S.C. 563, 671 S.E.2d 87 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We affirm.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals rested its affirmance on issue preservation grounds, that is,\r\n  the failure of the petitioners to argue to the circuit court that they had a\r\n  meritorious defense.[1]Â \r\n  A meritorious defense is necessary in order for a judgment to be set aside\r\n  under Rule 60(b).Â  See Mitchell Supp. Co., Inc. v. Gaffney, 297\r\n  S.C. 160, 375 S.E.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The Court of Appeals did not decide,\r\n  nor do we, whether a meritorious defense as to damages alone and not as to\r\n  liability is an adequate basis for the grant of Rule 60 relief.Â  Moreover, we\r\n  do not decide whether a party demonstrating a meritorious defense to the\r\n  damages awarded in the default proceeding would be entitled to have the entire\r\n  judgment set aside or merely the damages award. \r\nSince\r\n  the issue of a meritorious defense was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the\r\n  circuit court,[2] the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice John H. Waller, concur. TOAL, C.J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL: I respectfully dissent.Â  This\r\n  case presents an unusual fact scenario where New Prime, Inc. and Deaton\r\n  (collectively, Petitioners) challenge a default judgmentâ€”obtained, in my\r\n  opinion, by Respondents' trickery and deceptionâ€”by contesting damages, rather than\r\n  contesting liability.Â  The majority concludes the issue of whether the default\r\n  judgment should be set aside is unpreserved for appellate review because a\r\n  meritorious defense was neither raised to, nor ruled upon by the circuit\r\n  court.Â  I believe both Petitioners raised a meritorious defense in their\r\n  original pleadings before the circuit court by noting the substantial\r\n  discrepancy between the damages awarded upon default and the medical expenses\r\n  incurred or the settlement offer advanced by the plaintiffs.Â  The circuit court\r\n  ruled on that issue, finding Petitioners did not make a meritorious defense.Â \r\n  It is a question of first impression in this state whether a meritorious\r\n  defense to a default judgment may relate to damages or whether it may only\r\n  involve a defense to liability.Â  That question was squarely before the court of\r\n  appeals when the circuit court found Petitioners failed to raise a meritorious\r\ndefense. As such, it should be weighed on this Court's scales.Â  \r\nBecause the\r\n  majority neglected to include an explanation of the facts in its affirmance, I\r\n  include a recitation here.Â  In this case, Petitioners appeal the decision of\r\n  the court of appeals upholding the circuit court's denial of each of\r\n  Petitioners' Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motions.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 5, 2002, Deaton was driving a truck for his employer, New Prime, when\r\n  Deaton was involved in an accident with Respondent Ann McClurg.Â  Zurich North\r\n  American (Insurer) insured New Prime under a commercial trucker's general\r\n  liability policy with a $2 million per accident deductible.\r\nInsurer learned of\r\n  the accident on August 6, 2002, and began an investigation.Â  In September 2002,\r\n  Insurer received a letter of representation from the lawyer (Lawyer)\r\n  representing both Ann McClurg and her then-living husband Stephen McClurg.Â  In\r\n  October 2002, Deaton left New Prime's employment.\r\n Insurer and Lawyer\r\n  remained in contact, discussing injuries, medical treatments, and settlement\r\n  negotiations.Â  In April 2004, Insurer received a settlement package from Lawyer\r\n  demanding $170,000 to settle all claims.Â  On June 28, 2004, Lawyer sent Insurer\r\n  a letter referencing &quot;McClurg v. New Prime and Deaton,&quot; and stating\r\n  that if Insurer did not respond by next week regarding the settlement offer, he\r\n  would &quot;file suit and serve the Defendant and send [Insurer] a courtesy\r\n  copy of the pleadings.&quot;Â  In October 2004, Lawyer sent Insurer another\r\n  letter enclosing a draft complaint naming only Respondent Ann McClurg as\r\n  plaintiff and only New Prime as defendant, alleging that New Prime was\r\n  vicariously liable for Deaton's negligence, and New Prime was liable for the\r\n  negligent hiring, retention, and training of Deaton.Â  Later that month, Insurer\r\n  contacted Lawyer who agreed to delay filing the suit.Â  For the next eight\r\n  months, until June 2005, Insurer and Lawyer exchanged settlement offers, but\r\n  the parties could not reach an agreement.Â  At no time during these exchanges\r\n  did Lawyer indicate he intended to pursue an action solely against Deaton.Â  In\r\n  May 2005, Lawyer sent Insurer a new medical report, without mentioning that in\r\n  April 2005 he had filed suit on behalf of both McClurgs against Deaton only.\r\n Lawyer attempted to\r\n  serve Deaton in April 2005 through the South Carolina Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicles (SCDMV) pursuant to South Carolina Code section 15-9-350.Â  That\r\n  attempt at service was returned and marked as &quot;insufficient\r\n  address.&quot;Â  Lawyer then hired a private investigator, who found an\r\n  alternate address for Deaton in Texas, and in June 2005, the SCDMV sent the\r\n  complaint to Deaton by certified mail.Â  The return receipt was ostensibly signed\r\n  by Deaton on June 27, 2005.Â  Deaton denies ever receiving the Summons and\r\n  Complaint.Â  Deaton did not answer or otherwise appear, and the circuit court\r\n  filed an order of default on August 1, 2005.Â  Deaton failed to respond to\r\n  notice of the damages hearing, and in September 2005, the court entered judgments\r\n  totaling $800,000 against Deaton; $750,000 for Ann McClurg and $50,000 for\r\n  Stephen McClurg. \r\n On October 5, 2005,\r\n  after the expiration of the statute of limitations, Insurer contacted Lawyer's\r\n  office to check on the status of the settlement negotiations, but Lawyer's\r\n  staff would not give Insurer any information.Â  On October 7, 2005, Insurer\r\n  received a copy of the Deaton default judgment from Lawyer.Â  In the letter\r\n  accompanying the copy of the default judgment, Lawyer requested payment from\r\n  Insurer to satisfy the judgment against Deaton.Â  This is the first notice\r\n  Insurer and New Prime had of the suit brought against Deaton.Â  On that same\r\n  day, Deaton made a motion to set aside the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1)\r\n  and (b)(3), SCRCP. Â Â New Prime subsequently motioned to intervene and moved to\r\n  set aside the default judgment under this rule, as well.Â  The circuit court\r\n  granted New Prime's motion to intervene, but denied both Deaton's and New\r\n  Prime's Rule 60(b) motions.Â  The circuit court subsequently denied the parties'\r\n  motions for reconsideration under Rule 59(e), SCRCP.\r\nOn appeal, the\r\n  court of appeals affirmed in a 2-1 decision, with then-Chief Judge Hearn dissenting.Â  McClurg v. Deaton, 380 S.C. 563, 580, 671 S.E.2d 87, 96 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  The denial of relief for Petitioners rested entirely on the\r\n  determination that Petitioners failed to raise a meritorious defense when\r\n  motioning to set aside the default judgment.Â  Id. at 573, 671 S.E.2d at\r\n  93.Â  On the merits, the court of appeals held that, as an intervening party to\r\n  the action, New Prime was entitled to relief under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, if it\r\n  satisfied one of the Rule's requirements.[3]Â  Id. at 573, 671 S.E.2d at 92-93.Â  The court\r\n  of appeals then found that, at a minimum, the required element of surprise\r\n  existed.Â  Id. at 573, 671 S.E.2d at 92.Â  The court opined that Lawyer's\r\n  actions would most likely satisfy the misrepresentation and misconduct element\r\n  of Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP, as well.Â  Id. at 573, 671 S.E.2d at 92-93.Â \r\n  However, the court declined to offer relief to Petitioners, determining that\r\n  any meritorious defense that may have existed in the record was not raised to\r\n  or ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Id. Â Then-Chief Judge Hearn dissented\r\n  with respect to that conclusion, stating she believed Petitioners raised a\r\n  meritorious defense in the course of the pleadings.Â  Id. at 580, 671\r\n  S.E.2d at 96.Â  In short, I would adopt Judge Hearn's dissent.Â  \r\nPetitioners'\r\n  request for rehearing en banc was denied by a vote of 5 in favor, and 4\r\n  opposed.[4]Â  This Court granted both Deaton's and New Prime's\r\n  petitions for writs of certiorari.Â  \r\nOur standard of review in this case is\r\n  deferential.Â  The decision to grant or deny a motion for relief from judgment\r\n  lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed\r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.

Â &quot;An abuse of discretion arises where the judge\r\n  issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or where the order is based\r\n  on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.&quot; Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d at 503.\r\nDeaton and New Prime briefed their issues separately\r\n  to the Court, and present a variety of issues.Â  Because the question of whether\r\n  Petitioners raised a meritorious defense is dispositive, I address it first.Â \r\n  Both the court of appeals and the majority of this Court determined a\r\n  meritorious defense was neither raised to, nor ruled upon by the circuit\r\n  court.Â  In so finding, both courts disposed of this case on preservation\r\n  grounds.Â  I disagree with such a disposal. \r\n\r\nOur courts require\r\n  a party seeking to set aside a default judgment also raise a meritorious\r\n  defense.Â  See Mitchell Supply Co., Inc. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 163,\r\n  375 S.E.2d 321, 323 (Ct. App. 1988) (noting the South Carolina Code section\r\n  that was the precursor to the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure required\r\n  a showing of a meritorious defense, and holding the passage of the Rules do not\r\n  change that requirement).Â  It is in the interest of judicial efficiency that\r\n  our courts require a meritorious defense.Â  To borrow a statement from Chief\r\n  Judge Sanders writing for the court of appeals: &quot;[w]hatever doesn't make a\r\n  difference doesn't matter&quot; in the law.Â  McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C.\r\n  1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  As the meritorious defense\r\n  requirement derives from the policy that courts do not engage in acts of\r\n  futility:Â  \r\n\r\n  A\r\n    meritorious defense need not be perfect[,] nor one which can be guaranteed to\r\n    prevail at a trial.Â  It need be only one which is worthy of a hearing or\r\n    judicial inquiry because it raises a question of law deserving of some\r\n    investigation and discussion or a real controversy as to real facts arising\r\n    from conflicting or doubtful evidence.\r\n\r\nThompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 120, 382 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1989) (quoting\r\n  Graham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 248 S.E.2d 594 (1978)).Â  Therefore,\r\n  to demonstrate a meritorious defense, our courts have not required that parties\r\n  specifically tag their argument as a &quot;meritorious defense&quot; in a Rule\r\n  60(b) motion.[5]Â  Notably, in this case, the Court need not look\r\n  beyond the pleadings to find the\r\n  meritorious defense raised by Petitioners.\r\n In EM-CO Metal\r\n  Products, Inc. v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., the appellant\r\n  argued respondents did not make a prima facie showing of a meritorious\r\n  defense.Â  280 S.C. 107, 115, 311 S.E.2d 83, 88 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Although the\r\n  circuit court order did not set forth the facts upon which it found a\r\n  meritorious defense, the court of appeals affirmed the finding of a meritorious\r\n  defense based on evidence found in the record.Â  Specifically, the court of\r\n  appeals found evidence of a meritorious defense in the plaintiff's complaint\r\n  and in a letter introduced by the plaintiff at a hearing.Â  280 S.C. 107, 115,\r\n  311 S.E.2d 83, 88 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Although the letter purported to set forth\r\n  the plaintiff's position, the court found it nevertheless demonstrated that\r\n  both defendants in that case possessed a meritorious defense.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Importantly, the documents relied upon by the court of appeals were supplied by\r\n  the plaintiff, not the party seeking to have the judgment set aside.Â  The\r\n  majority states that in EM-CO, the court was merely asserting its Rule\r\n  220(b), SCACR, authority to affirm a ruling on any ground found in the record.Â \r\n  Perhaps, but on several occasions, our courts have reversed the denial\r\n  of a Rule 60(b) motion by finding the existence of a meritorious defense in the\r\n  record.Â  In Thompson, this Court reversed the denial of a Rule 60(b)\r\n  motion, finding testimony made at the motion hearing revealed the existence of\r\n  a real controversy, and therefore, the petitioners in that case presented a\r\n  meritorious defense.Â  Thompson, 299 S.C. at 120, 382 S.E.2d at 903\r\n  (1989).Â  In Williams v. Watkins, Jr., the court of appeals\r\n  reversed the circuit court's denial of a Rule 60(b) motion by gleaning a\r\n  meritorious defense from the record. Â 384 S.C. 319, 326-27, 681 S.E.2d 914,\r\n  917-18 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  In reversing, the court stated, &quot;[w]ith respect\r\n  to the meritorious defense factor, the record contains evidence Watkins made a\r\n  prima facie showing of a meritorious defense to Williams' claims.&quot;Â  Id. Â Â Â The majority distinguishes Williams on the ground that the court\r\n  found a meritorious defense in a pleading.Â  As I have noted, both Petitioners\r\n  presented a meritorious defense in the memoranda supporting their Rule 60(b)\r\n  motions.Â  I do not understand the majority's distinction.Â Â Â  \r\n In yet another\r\n  case, the court of appeals found a meritorious defense in a party's prehearing\r\n  statement.Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't Rev., 345 S.C 506, 511, 548\r\n  S.E.2d 23, 226 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In so finding, the court reiterated that the\r\n  standard for finding a party raised a meritorious defense is a low one.Â  Id. (&quot;To establish a meritorious defense, a party is not required to show an\r\n  absolute defense.&quot;).Â  Further research would likely reveal a multitude of\r\n  similar cases.Â  In my view, the key inquiry is merely whether the materials\r\n  submitted to the trial court reflect, in any way, that a contest on the merits\r\n  might render different results than the result reached by the default\r\n  judgment.Â Â Â  \r\n In this case, the\r\n  majority of the court of appeals, and this Court's majority, rests on the\r\n  conclusion that the moving party must expressly indicate to the court that a\r\n  Rule 60(b) argument is being made for the purpose of providing a meritorious\r\n  defense.Â  The court of appeals recognized New Prime's argument on appeal that\r\n  its defense related to the discrepancy in damages awarded versus the amount\r\n  offered by Lawyer during settlement negotiations.Â  McClurg, 380 S.C. at\r\n  575, 671 S.E.2d at 94.Â  In reviewing the record, the court noted an allegation\r\n  in an affidavit by the Insurer's employee that Lawyer offered a far lesser\r\n  amount during settlement negotiations. Â Id. at 575-76, 617 S.E.2d at\r\n  94.Â  The court found that statement was not made for the purpose of raising a\r\n  meritorious defense.Â  Id. at 576, 617 S.E.2d at 94.Â  The court did not\r\n  reach the question of whether this evidence could constitute a meritorious\r\n  defense, but stated, &quot;even assuming for the sake of argument that this\r\n  bare assertion regarding settlement negotiations is evidence of a defense to\r\n  the amount of damages, the argument is not preserved for our review as it was neither\r\n  raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court.&quot;Â  Id. Â In my view,\r\n  Petitioners each raised a meritorious defense to damages directly within the\r\n  memoranda supporting their motions to set aside the default judgment, and\r\n  supported that claim in an affidavit of a claims specialist with the Insurer.Â \r\n  New Prime's memorandum states: &quot;Neither Zurich nor New Prime heard about\r\n  the suit that was filed against Deaton until . . . after the default judgment\r\n  for $800,000 was entered.Â  Plaintiff's counsel had previously demanded $170,000\r\n  to settle the matter.&quot;Â  Likewise, Deaton's memorandum characterizes the\r\n  judgment as a &quot;windfall,&quot; stating &quot;their Counsel made a\r\n  settlement demand of $170,000 from Zurich on April 26, 2004, little over a year\r\n  before the Default Judgment of over four times that amount was entered.&quot;Â \r\n  To support the claim that the damages on default far exceeded what would have\r\n  otherwise been awarded with a decision on the merits, Deaton provides the\r\n  affidavit of a claims specialist with the Insurer that stated Ann McClurg\r\n  incurred medical expenses of approximately $21,000, and Respondents made a\r\n  settlement offer of $170,000.[6]Â  \r\n In addition to its\r\n  contention that a meritorious defense was not raised to the circuit court, the\r\n  majority argues that neither Petitioner challenged the circuit judge's finding\r\n  that there was no showing of a meritorious defense in their motions for\r\n  reconsideration.Â  Because I believe Petitioners raised a meritorious defense in\r\n  their original pleadings and that the circuit judge ruled on that issue, our\r\n  preservation rules do not require they contest that finding in a motion for\r\n  reconsideration. Â See Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602\r\n  S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (a party is only required to file a motion to reconsider\r\n  when an issue has been raised but not ruled upon by the court).Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  Deaton did raise the meritorious defense of the discrepancy in damages as a\r\n  third ground in his motion for reconsideration.Â  (see App. at 184-85,\r\n  &quot;Because of the defect in pleading and disparity between the award and\r\n  medical expenses, the default judgment should be set aside;&quot; see also App. 542-43.)Â  This being clear, the majority is apparently expounding the view\r\n  that a party must use the magic words, &quot;meritorious defense,&quot; when\r\n  arguing that a court may have reached a different result had it heard a case on\r\n  the merits.Â  As elaborated, our courts have never before required such explicit\r\n  language.\r\n The majority\r\n  finally attempts to prove the issue unpreserved by concluding Petitioners did\r\n  not challenge the circuit court's finding of no meritorious defense in its\r\n  appeal to the court of appeals.Â  To the contrary, Deaton appealed the circuit\r\n  court's meritorious defense ruling in his third issue before the court of\r\n  appeals.Â  There, Deaton again argued that because the McClurgs' complaint did\r\n  not include a request for damages from future loss of in-kind services, it was\r\n  error for the trial court to award Ann McClurg $600,000 in damages on that\r\n  ground.Â  That argument represents a meritorious defense as it &quot;raises a\r\n  question of law deserving of some investigation and discussion or a real\r\n  controversy as to real facts arising from conflicting or doubtful evidence.&quot;Â  Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 120, 382 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1989).Â  \r\nThe question of\r\n  whether a meritorious defense can relate to damages or if it can relate only to\r\n  the existence of liability is one of first impression in this state.Â  It was\r\n  clear in both Deaton's and New Prime's motions to set aside default judgment\r\n  that, if given the opportunity to defend the lawsuit properly,Â  the outcome may\r\n  very well have been different based on the actual damages incurred.Â  Therefore,\r\n  I believe that when the circuit judge found &quot;there has been no showing\r\n  that a meritorious defense exists in this case,&quot; he reached this\r\n  conclusion on the belief that Petitioners were required to raise a defense to\r\n  liability.Â  Petitioners argued to the court of appeals, and to this Court, that\r\n  its meritorious defense related to the discrepancy in damages awarded.Â  Because\r\n  I agree with Petitioners that a meritorious defense can relate not only to the\r\n  liability of the defendant, but also to the amount of damages awarded, I\r\n  believe it was error for the court of appeals to find the issue was not raised\r\n  to or ruled upon by the circuit court, and I dissent from the majority's\r\n  similar disposition of this case.\r\n In support of my\r\n  position, I note other courts have recognized that an allegation relating to\r\n  the amount of damages satisfies the meritorious defense requirement.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Augusta Fiberglass Coatings, Inc. v. Fodor Contracting Corp.,\r\n  843 F.2d 808, 812 (4th Cir. 1988) (discussing the meritorious defense raised:\r\n  &quot;[a]lthough these statements address the amount, rather than the\r\n  propriety, of Augusta's claim, we believe that taken together they are a\r\n  sufficient proffer of a meritorious defense&quot;); Wayneright's Vacations,\r\n    LLC v. Pan American Airways Corp., 130 F.Supp.2d 712, 719 (D. Md. 2001)\r\n  (discussing Augusta Fiberglass and concluding, &quot;[t]he company has\r\n  raised a viable dispute about the amount it owes Pan Am&quot;); Esteppe v.\r\n    Patapsco &amp; Back Rivers Railroad, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7112, 2001 WL\r\n  604186 (D. Md. 2001) (appellant raised a meritorious defense &quot;by\r\n  contradicting the amount claimed by plaintiff&quot;).Â  There are many\r\n  instances, and this case is an example, where a defendant does not contest\r\n  liability, but contests the extent of damages owed.Â  Restricting the scope of a\r\n  meritorious defense to liability alone incentivizes a party who may otherwise\r\n  concede liability to deny any wrongdoing.Â  I do not believe our courts wish to\r\n  encourage that practice.Â  At oral argument before this Court, there was concern\r\n  that allowing a meritorious defense to damages might impede the finality of\r\n  judgments, in that any discrepancy between actual damages and awarded damages\r\n  could be a basis for setting aside a default judgment.Â  I note that a\r\n  meritorious defense to the amount of damages awarded must first be accompanied\r\n  by a showing that the action filed meets the requirements of Rule 60(b)(1)-(5),\r\n  SCRCP.\r\nAfter surmounting\r\n  the meritorious defense hurdle, I side with the court of appeals' view that by\r\n  virtue of allowing New Prime to intervene, it was entitled to an order setting\r\n  aside the judgment if New Prime could meet the requirements of Rule 60(b)(1) or\r\n  (b)(3).Â  McClurg, 380 S.C. at 571, 671 S.E.2d at 92.Â  Our holding in Edwards\r\n    v. Ferguson, is instructive on this point.Â  254 S.C. 278, 175 S.E.2d 224\r\n  (1970).Â  In that case, Ferguson and his insurance company moved to set aside a\r\n  default judgment on the ground that it was taken by mistake, inadvertence,\r\n  surprise, or excusable neglect.Â  Id.Â  The plaintiff in that case\r\n  attempted to settle with the insurance company.Â  Id.Â  When settlement\r\n  did not develop, the plaintiff served a summons and complaint to the home of\r\n  Ferguson.Â  Id.Â  Ferguson did not answer or inform his insurance company of\r\n  the complaint, and the circuit court entered default judgment for the\r\n  plaintiff.Â  Id.Â  This Court found the insurance company &quot;stands in\r\n  the shoes of [its insured] so far as liability is concerned.&quot;Â  Id. at 282, 175 S.E.2d at 226. \r\n I agree with the court\r\n  of appeals that the trial court erred in finding the elements of Rules 60(b)(1)\r\n  and (b)(3) could not apply to New Prime since New Prime was not the party\r\n  served.Â  The burden of this judgment ultimately will fall on New Prime's\r\n  shoulders and, therefore, I believe the court of appeals properly found New\r\n  Prime could stand in Deaton's shoes when arguing the existence of surprise,\r\n  misrepresentation, or misconduct under Rule 60(b)(1) and (b)(3), SCRCP. \r\n On the facts in the\r\n  record, I believe New Prime undoubtedly met both the surprise element of Rule\r\n  60(b)(1) and the misconduct element of Rule 60(b)(3) when moving to have the\r\n  default judgment set aside.Â  At oral argument before this Court, Lawyer\r\n  admitted he was trying to fly under the radar in serving Deaton because of the\r\n  prolonged, and seemingly unsuccessful, settlement negotiations with Insurer.Â \r\n  Although prolonging settlement negotiations in hopes of surpassing the statute\r\n  of limitations is a disdainful practice some insurance companies keep, this in\r\n  no way justifies the type of &quot;gotcha&quot; game played by McClurgs'\r\n  counsel in this case.Â  \r\n In sum, I would\r\n  find Petitioners met their burden to set aside the default judgment by\r\n  demonstrating the existence of surprise and misconduct.Â  Further, in my\r\n  opinion, Petitioners' supporting memoranda and affidavits to the Rule 60(b)\r\n  motions provided the court a basis for concluding that a contest on the merits\r\n  might result in a different outcome by illustrating the discrepancy between the\r\n  amount of damages awarded and the actual damages suffered or the settlement\r\n  offer advanced by Respondents.Â  It was an error of law for the circuit judge to\r\n  determine that because Petitioners did not deny liability, Petitioners did not\r\n  raise a meritorious defense.Â  I believe it was error for the court of appeals\r\n  to conclude Petitioners did not raise a meritorious defense, and accordingly, I\r\n  part ways with the majority in its affirmance of the court of appeals on that\r\n  ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] &quot;Preserving issues for appellate review is a fundamental component of\r\n  appellate practice.&quot;Â  Toal, Vafai, Muckenfuss Appellate Procedure in\r\n    South Carolina (1999) 65.Â  Issue preservation requires that the question\r\n  presented to the appellate court &quot;must first have been fairly and properly\r\n  raised in the lower court and passed upon by that court.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  dissent would alter these well-settled precepts in favor of burdening trial\r\n  courts with discerning the issues a party should raise, and perusing the record\r\n  for evidence to support those issues.Â  \r\nHere, the dissent would find the issue of a\r\n  meritorious defense raised by New Prime when, in two sentences in the portion of\r\n  its pretrial memorandum titled &quot;Background,&quot; which preceeds the\r\n  section titled &quot;Argument,&quot; it states:\r\n\r\n  Neither Zurich nor New Prime heard\r\n    about the suit that was filed against Deaton until October 7, 2005, after the\r\n    default judgment for $800,000 was entered (see Affidavit of Gail Meyer at Â¶\r\n    13-14).Â  Plaintiff's counsel had previously demanded $170,000 to settle the\r\n    matter.\r\n\r\nThe dissent also finds Deaton raised a meritorious\r\n  defense when, in its &quot;Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Amended Motion\r\n  to Set Aside Default Judgment,&quot; he footnoted his text sentence\r\n  &quot;Therefore, the Plaintiffs' loss of a windfall Default Judgment simply\r\n  should not be a factor in the Court's decision&quot; with the following:\r\n\r\n  It is appropriate to characterize\r\n    the Default Judgment as a windfall for Plaintiffs given the fact that their\r\n    Counsel made a settlement demand of $170,000 from Zurich on April 26, 2004,\r\n    little over a year before the Default Judgment of over four times that amount\r\n    was entered.Â  See Exhibit A Â¶ 16.\r\n\r\nTo say that these three sentences &quot;fairly and\r\n  properly raised&quot; the issue of a meritorious defense to the circuit court,\r\n  albeit without use of &quot;magic words&quot; strains credulity, as does the\r\n  suggestion that Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 382 S.E.2d 900 (1989)\r\n  stands for the proposition that a party need not argue &quot;the existence of a\r\n  meritorious defense within a Rule 60(b) motion.&quot;Â  \r\n Moreover, it is well-settled that the moving\r\n  party in a Rule 60(b) motion has the burden of presenting evidence entitling him to relief.Â  BB&amp;T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 633 S.E.2d\r\n  501 (2006) (emphasis supplied).Â  Memorandum in support of a motion is not\r\n  evidence.Â  Harris Teeter, Inc. v. Moore &amp; Van Allen, PLLC, 390 S.C.\r\n  275, 701 S.E.2d 742 (2010) (Hearn, J., dissenting).Â  Even if we were to find\r\n  that the issue of a meritorious defense were suggested by the memoranda,\r\n  neither petitioner could be said to have presented evidence of such a defense\r\n  as it is beyond cavil that a settlement offer is not evidence.Â  Rule 408, SCRE; Fesmire v. Digh, 385 S.C. 296, 683 S.E.2d 803 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nFinally, if we were to construe the trial\r\n  judge's statement that &quot;there has been no showing of a meritorious\r\n  defense&quot; as a ruling rather than an observation, compare Mize v.\r\n    Blue Ridge Ry. Co., 219 S.C. 119, 64 S.E.2d 253 (1951) (mere observations\r\n  by trial judge do not enlarge grounds upon which motion is made), the fact\r\n  remains that he would have been correct.Â  Rule 408, SCRE; Fesmire, supra.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Although both petitioners filed motions for reconsideration in the trial court,\r\n  neither challenged the finding of the circuit court that there was no showing\r\n  of a meritorious defense.Â  Moreover, petitioner New Prime did not challenge the\r\n  finding of no meritorious defense in its appellant's brief.Â Â  Petitioner\r\n  Deaton, in his appellant's brief, referenced a discrepancy between the\r\n  documented medical expenses and the damages award only in support of his\r\n  argument that there was a defect in respondent's pleading warranting a setting\r\n  aside of the default judgment.Â  The settlement offer was not mentioned.Â  The\r\n  &quot;substantial discrepancy between the settlement offer and the amount\r\n  awarded upon default&quot; relied upon by the dissent as the basis for a\r\n  meritorious defense appears for the first time in petitioners' appellate reply\r\n  briefs.Â  It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time in a\r\n  reply brief.Â  Chet Adams Co. v. Jones F. Pedersen Co., 307 S.C. 33, 413\r\n  S.E.2d 827 (1992).Â  \r\nNone of the cases cited by the dissent\r\n  support the dissent's proposition that a party is not required to argue to the\r\n  trial or appellate court that it has a meritorious defense in order to obtain\r\n  Rule 60(b) relief.Â  In EM-CO Metal Prods., Inc. v. Great Atlantic &amp;\r\n    Pacific Tea Co., 280 S.C. 107, 311 S.E.2d 83 (Ct. App. 1984), the Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed an order relieving respondent from a default judgment under\r\n  the statutory predecessor to Rule 60(b), citing both deference to judicial\r\n  discretion and the &quot;liberal spirit&quot; of the statute, a spirit which\r\n  did not survive the adoption of the SCRCP.Â  Sundown Operating Co., Inc. v.\r\n    Intedge Industries, Inc., 385 S.C. 601, 681 S.E.2d 885 (2009) (standard for\r\n  relief under Rule 60(b) rigorous).Â  Moreover, in EM-CO, the appealed\r\n  order stated respondent had a meritorious defense but did not support this\r\n  conclusion of law by factual findings.Â  Appellant argued this omission required\r\n  reversal.Â  The Court of Appeals, in affirming this conclusion, noted there was\r\n  evidence in the record to support it in an attorney's letter.Â  In EM-CO,\r\n  the court looked for evidence to affirm a finding by the trial court, while\r\n  here the dissent is searching for evidence to reverse.Â  Moreover, the dissent\r\n  finds this evidence in mere factual recitations which reflect a settlement\r\n  offer made long before discovery was complete or a complaint had been filed.Â  \r\n The dissent's reliance on Mictronics,\r\n  Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Rev., 345 S.C. 506, 548 S.E.2d 223 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n  and William v. Watkins, 389 S.C. 319, 681 S.E.2d 914 (Ct. App. 2009) is\r\n  similarly misplaced.Â  In Mictronics, the Court of Appeals affirmed a\r\n  circuit court order granting relief from an administrative law judge's (ALJ's)\r\n  order dismissing a contested case for procedural reasons, using its authority\r\n  to affirm an appeal for any reason appearing in the record.Â  See Rule\r\n  220(b), SCACR.Â  The court found the circuit court had applied the incorrect\r\n  standard in reversing the ALJ's order, and proceeded to review the case under\r\n  the correct standard.Â  The court, applying this new standard, found evidence of\r\n  a meritorious defense in the respondent's prehearing statement, that is, the\r\n  document it had filed with the ALJ in support of the merits of its claim that\r\n  it was entitled to a tax exemption.Â  This decision does not stand for the\r\n  proposition that an appellate court must search the record for evidence of a\r\n  meritorious defense in order to reverse an appealed order, but rather that when\r\n  affirming for any reason, the court may rely on arguments actually raised by\r\n  the party below.Â  In William v. Watkins, the Court of Appeals found the\r\n  meritorious defense in the party's pleading.Â  \r\nHere, the dissent does not rely on any\r\n  argument made to the lower tribunal but instead searches the record for\r\n  evidence to support an argument raised for the first time in a petition for\r\n  rehearing after the Court of Appeals had affirmed the appeal.Â  It is axiomatic\r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on rehearing.Â  E.g., Nelson\r\n    v. QHG of South Carolina, Inc., 362 S.C. 421, 608 S.E.2d 855 (2005).\r\nThe dissent goes beyond plain error, and\r\n  would require appellate courts to search the record in an effort to reverse.Â \r\n  This we should not do.Â  E.g., Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361\r\n  S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004).\r\n[3] Rule 60(b), SCRCP, provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    On motion and\r\n      upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal\r\n      representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following\r\n      reasons:\r\n    (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect;\r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . .\r\n    (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party\r\n  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n    . . .\r\n\r\n[4] &quot;It shall require the affirmative vote of six (6) members of the Court of\r\n  Appeals to hear or rehear an appeal or other proceeding en banc.&quot; Rule\r\n  219, SCACR.\r\n[5] Â In asserting the contrary position, the majority notes the rigorous standard\r\n  of Rule 60(b), SCRCP, citing Richardson v. P.V., Inc., 383 S.C. 610, 682\r\n  S.E.2d 263 (2009).Â  Richardson stands for the proposition that the\r\n  standard for finding mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect under\r\n  Rule 60(b)(1) or fraud and misrepresentation under 60(b)(3) is more rigorous\r\n  than the standard required to set aside an entry of default judgment under Rule\r\n  55(c).Â  Id.Â  Rule 60(b) requires a party make a particularized showing\r\n  of the elements under subsections 1 or 3, as opposed to Rule 55(c), where a\r\n  party may prevail with a showing of good cause.Â  Id.Â  Richardson does not assert that a defendant's Rule 60(b) motion must include the words\r\n  &quot;meritorious defense&quot; to demonstrate that adjudication on the merits\r\n  might lead to a different result.Â  Additionally, the &quot;liberal spirit&quot;\r\n  of Rule 60(b) did not see its demise with the adoption of the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure (SCRCP), as the majority contends.Â  As stated in Thompson\r\n    v. Hammond, 299 S.C. at 122, 382 S.E.2d at 904 (J. Chandler dissenting),\r\n  and supported in numerous cases decided after the adoption of the SCRCP\r\n  (discussed herein), &quot;Rule 60(b)(1) is virtually identical to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-27-130 (1976), which was repealed in 1985 with enactment of the Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure.&quot;\r\n[6] The majority argues that because a settlement offer is not admissible evidence\r\n  of damages under Rule 408, SCRE, these statements cannot fairly be construed as\r\n  meritorious defenses.Â  I reiterate that the purpose of requiring a meritorious\r\n  defense when petitioning a court to set aside a default judgment is simpleâ€”to\r\n  prevent courts from engaging in acts of futility by re-opening litigation where\r\n  there is no real controversy.Â  I do not consider the settlement offer\r\n  referenced by Petitioners to represent evidence of what the damages ought to\r\n  be.Â  However, I believe that the evidence meets the low bar set for a\r\n  meritorious defense in that it merely demonstrates the existence of a real\r\n  controversy and the probability that a decision on the merits might render a\r\n  different result.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27039","title":"In the Matter of Michael James Sarratt","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=27039","description":"This is an opinion in which the Court publicly reprimands a lawyer.","date":"2011-09-12","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Michael\r\n      James Sarratt, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion\r\n  No.Â  27039\r\nSubmitted\r\n  July 12, 2011 - Filed September 12, 2011Â \r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLesley M.

Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client\r\n  reasonably informed about status of the matter); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make\r\n  reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the\r\n  client); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate\r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct)\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We find that\r\n  respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept\r\n  the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for\r\n  his misconduct.Â  In addition, respondent shall complete the Ethics School\r\n  portion of LEAPP and provide certification of completion to the Commission\r\n  within one (1) year of the date of this order and he shall pay the costs\r\n  incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the\r\n  Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of this order.\r\n\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Rosenfeld, of Porter &amp; Rosenfeld, of Greenville, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nJoseph M. Ramseur, Jr., of Greenville, and Steven E. Buckingham, of\r\n  Gallivan, White &amp; Boyd, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:Â  This case presents the novel issue of whether an action for\r\n  separate maintenance and support can be pursued when the parties are still\r\n  living together.Â  We hold that it cannot and affirm the family court's decision\r\n  to dismiss this action.Â  Due to our conclusion that this action fails a matter\r\n  of law, we further hold that the family court did not err in cancelling the lis\r\n    pendens and request for attorney's fees filed in conjunction with this suit.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEileen (Wife) and Clifford (Husband)\r\n  Theisen were married in 1980.Â  Aside from various forms of seasonal employment,\r\n  Wife was a homemaker for the vast majority of the marriage.Â  Husband currently\r\n  receives dividend payments from his interest in his family's business as well\r\n  as some compensation for serving as a director of the business, but the current\r\n  economic crisis placed a strain on the parties' other financial resources.Â  At\r\n  the time of this action, the parties owned three properties: the marital home,\r\n  which is in Wife's name, and two rental properties, both of which are in\r\n  Husband's name.\r\n Husband\r\n  readily acknowledges that he and Wife have had their fair share of difficulties\r\n  during the course of their thirty-year marriage.Â  In fact, Wife has filed for\r\n  divorce[1] on two previous occasions, at least one of which was premised on the fault\r\n  ground of physical cruelty.Â  Husband and Wife reconciled following the first\r\n  petition, and the second was dismissed because the proceedings were not\r\n  concluded within one year from the date of filing.Â  In Husband's view, these\r\n  actions were &quot;nothing more than efforts to get [his] attention. . . .\r\n  [They] stay living together, she calms down and life goes back to normal.&quot;\r\n Wife\r\n  subsequently filed this action for separate maintenance alleging Husband &quot;has\r\n  engaged and continues to engage in a course of conduct making it unreasonable\r\n  and unfair to require [Wife] to continue to live with him.&quot;Â  In\r\n  particular, Wife complained of Husband's unilateral control and disposal of\r\n  marital assets, creation and non-payment of debts in Wife's name, and present\r\n  emotional and verbal abuse.Â  In her complaint, Wife asked the family court to\r\n  award the following: (1) separate\r\n  maintenance and support; (2) custody of the minor children;[2] (3) child support; (4) spousal support; (5) sole and exclusive use and\r\n  possession of the marital home; (6) sole and exclusive use and possession of\r\n  one of the parties' vehicles; (7) equitable division of marital assets and\r\n  debts; and (8) attorney's fees.Â  She also moved for temporary relief and filed\r\n  a lis pendens on each of the rental properties in Husband's name.Â \r\n  Despite alleging that Husband's conduct was so unreasonable and unfair that\r\n  Wife should not have to live with him, Husband and Wife continued to live in\r\n  the same house before and after she filed the instant action, albeit sleeping\r\n  in different rooms.[3]\r\n Husband\r\n  counterclaimed for equitable distribution of the marital assets and debts as\r\n  well as attorney's fees.Â  He contended that the parties' difficulties were the\r\n  result of their recent financial situation, not a course of conduct designed to\r\n  denigrate Wife.Â  Husband further made motions to dismiss Wife's complaint under\r\n  Rule 12, SCRCP, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a\r\n  claim upon which relief can be granted.Â  Both motions were premised on the fact\r\n  that Husband and Wife were not living separate and apart.Â  He also moved to\r\n  cancel the lis pendens placed on his rental properties.\r\nThe family court held a combined hearing on Wife's motion for\r\n  temporary relief and Husband's motions to dismiss and cancel the lis pendens.Â \r\n  The court found it &quot;has the jurisdiction to order separate support and\r\n  maintenance, [but it] does not have the authority to do so when the parties are\r\n  living together.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the court concluded &quot;Wife has failed\r\n  to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action&quot; and dismissed\r\n  her complaint.Â  Based on that finding, the court cancelled each lis pendens,\r\n  denied Wife temporary relief, and denied each party attorney's fees.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\n Wife raises four issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n       Does the family court have subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction to hear a claim for separate maintenance when the parties\r\n  are still living together?Does the family court have subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction to hear a claim for separate maintenance when the parties\r\n  are still living together?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n       Did the family court err in\r\n  dismissing Wife's complaint because it failed to allege the parties are no\r\n  longer living together?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.\r\n       Did the family court err in cancelling\r\n  Wife's lis pendens on Husband's rental properties?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Did the family court err in not\r\n  awarding Wife attorney's fees?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; SUBJECT\r\n  MATTER  Jurisdiction\r\nWife first\r\n  argues the family court erred in not exercising jurisdiction over this matter.Â \r\n  However, Wife's argument misconstrues the court's finding that it lacks\r\n  &quot;authority&quot; to hear the claim as a finding that it lacks subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction.\r\n&quot;Subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is 'the power to hear and determine cases of the general\r\n  class to which the proceedings in question belong.'&quot; Dove v. Gold Kist,\r\n    Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (quoting Bank of\r\n      Babylon v. Quirk, 472 A.2d 21, 22 (Conn. 1984)).Â  Because the family court\r\n  is a creature of statute, it is a court of limited jurisdiction. State v.\r\n    Graham, 340 S.C. 352, 355, 532 S.E.2d 262, 263 (2000).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  &quot;[i]ts jurisdiction is limited to that expressly or by necessary\r\n  implication conferred by statute.&quot; Id.Â  Section 63-3-530(A)(2) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2010) provides that &quot;[t]he family court has\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction . . . to hear and determine actions for divorce a vinculo matrimonii, separate support and maintenance, legal separation,\r\n  and in other marital litigation between the parties.&quot;\r\nSection\r\n  63-3-530(A)(2) therefore expressly confers upon the family court the power to\r\n  hear all actions for separate maintenance.Â  Indeed, the family court expressly\r\n  found it had jurisdiction over this matter.Â  Wife, however, interprets the word\r\n  &quot;authority&quot; as meaning the court found its jurisdiction to be\r\n  limited, and she accordingly engages in a discussion of the differences between\r\n  &quot;jurisdiction,&quot; &quot;exercise of jurisdiction,&quot; and\r\n  &quot;authority.&quot; Â This argument misapprehends the nature of the family\r\n  court's ruling, and it confuses and conflates the concepts of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction and the statutory elements to receive the relief sought.Â  The\r\n  court's order merely found that it lacked authority to award separate\r\n  maintenance because Wife failed to plead its essential elements, not because the\r\n  court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Therefore, her arguments are more\r\n  properly directed towards the court's dismissal of her claim under Rule 12(b)(6),\r\n  SCRCP.\r\nII.&nbsp; FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM\r\nWife\r\n  next argues the family court erred in dismissing her complaint because she\r\n  failed to allege she was living separate and apart from Husband.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  20-3-130(B)(5) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) contains the following\r\n  provisions regarding separate maintenance:\r\n\r\nAlimony\r\n  and separate maintenance and support awards may be granted pendente lite and permanently in such amounts and for periods of time subject to conditions\r\n  as the court considers just including, but not limited to:\r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\n(5)&nbsp; Separate maintenance and support\r\n  to be paid periodically, but terminating upon the continued cohabitation of the\r\n  supported spouse, upon divorce of the parties, or upon the death of either\r\n  spouse . . . and terminable and modifiable based upon changed circumstances in\r\n  the future.Â  The purpose of this form of support may include, but is not\r\n  limited to, circumstances where a divorce is not sought, but it is necessary to\r\n  provide for support of the supported spouse by way of separate maintenance and\r\n  support when the parties are living separate and apart.\r\n  \r\n\r\n Initially, we note\r\n  that section 20-3-130(B)(5) does not specifically state whether the parties\r\n  must live separate and apart prior to petitioning the court for separate\r\n  maintenance.Â  However, the very name separate maintenance and support connotes\r\n  separation between the parties.Â  &quot;Separate&quot; means &quot;to set or\r\n  keep apart&quot; or &quot;become divided or detached.&quot; Merriam-Webster\r\n  Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/separate.Â  Thus, the\r\n  purpose of separate maintenance is to provide support for a spouse when he or\r\n  she is living apart from the other spouse. Â The statute also specifically\r\n  states that it applies when the parties are living separate and apart but a\r\n  divorce is not sought.Â  The fact that separate maintenance terminates upon the\r\n  continuous cohabitation of the supported spouse with another is more evidence\r\n  of the same; the supported spouse cannot cohabitate with another unless he has\r\n  already separated from the payor spouse.Â  Furthermore, Wife's emphasis that she\r\n  sleeps in a different room than Husband appears to be a tacit recognition on\r\n  her part that at least some degree of separation is required.\r\n We implicitly have recognized\r\n  for years that living separate and apart is a requirement for separate\r\n  maintenance.Â  Under South Carolina law, a spouse does not need grounds that\r\n  would merit a divorce in order to receive separate maintenance. Machado v.\r\n    Machado, 220 S.C. 90, 103, 66 S.E.2d 629, 635 (1951).Â  We have thus refused\r\n  to define any specific grounds and instead have left this decision to the\r\n  discretion of the family court.[4] Id.Â  However, we have often searched for whether there was justificationâ€”whatever\r\n  that justification may beâ€”for the supported spouse to leave the marital\r\n  home. See, e.g., Welch v. Welch, 250 S.C. 264, 268, 157 S.E.2d 249, 251\r\n  (1967) (holding a wife was entitled to separate maintenance and support where\r\n  &quot;[s]o far as man may judge, the alienation of the parties is complete, and\r\n  a resumption of cohabitation would be intolerable&quot;); Inabinet v.\r\n    Inabinet, 236 S.C. 52, 56, 113 S.E.2d 66, 68 (1960) (stating in the context\r\n  of separate maintenance that &quot;[i]t is the duty of a husband to provide for\r\n  his wife, in accordance with his means, a home wherein she may live as the\r\n  object of his care and affection without interference from members of the\r\n  household; and if he fails or refuses to provide such a home she will be\r\n  justified in leaving and will not be guilty of desertion if she does so&quot;); Owens v. Owens, 221 S.C. 84, 89, 69 S.E.2d 74, 76 (1952) (discussing question\r\n  specifically raised on appeal regarding an award of separate maintenance of\r\n  whether facts showed wife was justified in leaving the home); Machado,\r\n  220 S.C. at 103, 66 S.E.2d at 635 (&quot;We think under our decisions that the\r\n  conduct of appellant was sufficient to justify the respondent in leaving the\r\n  home and that she is entitled to separate maintenance and support.&quot;). \r\n While we have never\r\n  specifically addressed the precise question presented here, we have addressed\r\n  whether a spouse must leave the marital home when seeking a divorce, despite no\r\n  statutory language directly on point.Â  If the parties are seeking a no-fault\r\n  divorce based on one year's continuous separation, they must live in separate\r\n  domiciles during that time. Barnes v. Barnes, 276 S.C. 519, 520, 280\r\n  S.E.2d 538, 539 (1981).Â  Our rationale was that otherwise, evidence of the\r\n  actual separation, which is the gravamen of a no-fault divorce, would exist\r\n  only &quot;behind the closed doors of the matrimonial domicile,&quot; thus\r\n  encouraging collusion between the parties. Id. Â The same rule applies if\r\n  the parties seek a divorce on the fault ground of desertion. Watson v.\r\n    Watson, 319 S.C. 92, 94, 460 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1995).Â  \r\nOn\r\n  the other hand, citing public policy concerns and the diminished threat of\r\n  collusion or condonation, we refused to extend that rule to parties seeking a\r\n  fault-based divorce on any other ground. Id. at 94, 460 S.E.2d at 395-96.Â \r\n  As we stated in Watson, in those fault-based situations it is better to\r\n  permit the separating spouse to remain in the home at the time of filing, and\r\n  have custody and other living arrangements dealt with at a temporary hearing,\r\n  than to require that spouse to vacate the home and potentially cause more\r\n  disruption in the family's life at the time of filing. Id. at 94, 460\r\n  S.E.2d at 395.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  public policy concerns that drove our decision in Watson are not present\r\n  here.Â  Therefore, in order to state a claim for separate maintenance, the\r\n  complaint must allege that the parties are living separate and apart.Â  To hold\r\n  otherwise would permit spouses to inundate the family court with claims\r\n  following relatively minor disputes and quarrels.Â  Because there are no defined\r\n  grounds for this relief, parties could bring an action in the family court for\r\n  almost any reason absent some threshold requirement.Â  Requiring spouses to\r\n  separate stems this tide by helping guarantee that court intervention into the\r\n  marital relationship actually is truly necessary because the grounds underlying\r\n  the complaint will at least be enough to warrant leaving the marital home.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  living separate and apart must involve more than the cessation of the parties'\r\n  romantic relationship.Â  &quot;The overwhelming weight of authority as to what\r\n  is meant by living 'separate and apart' . . . implies something more than a\r\n  discontinuance of sexual relations . . . .Â  It implies the living apart . . .\r\n  in such a manner that those in the neighborhood may see that the husband and\r\n  wife are not living together.&quot; Boozer v. Boozer, 242 S.C. 292,\r\n  296-97, 130 S.E.2d 903, 905 (1963) (internal citations and quotations omitted); accord Whitman v. Whitman, 137 So. 666, 666 (Ala. 1931) (&quot;The bill\r\n  does not make out such a case when it shows that there has been an abandonment\r\n  or separation and that the complainant and respondent were living together as\r\n  man and wife when the bill or petition was filed.&quot;); Hemphill v.\r\n    Hemphill, 324 P.2d 225, 228 (Ariz. 1958) (&quot;A wife's action for\r\n  separate maintenance generally presupposes a separation . . . .&quot;); Kesterson\r\n    v. Kesterson, 731 S.W.2d 786, 788 (Ark. Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;All that must\r\n  be established are a separation and an absence of fault.&quot;); Baumgartner\r\n    v. Baumgartner, 148 N.E.2d 327, 330 (Ill. App. Ct. 1958) (&quot;A complaint\r\n  lacking an allegation that the parties are living separate and apart without\r\n  fault on the part of the plaintiff fails to state a cause of action.&quot;); Lynch\r\n    v. Lynch, 616 So. 2d 294, 296 (Miss. 1993) (&quot;It is well-established\r\n  that '[a] decree for separate maintenance is a judicial command to the husband\r\n  to resume cohabitation with his wife, or in default thereof, to provide\r\n  suitable maintenance of her until such time as they be reconciled to each\r\n  other.'&quot; (citations omitted)).Â  Thus, prior to petitioning the court for\r\n  separate maintenance, the parties must live in separate domiciles.\r\nThe\r\n  dissent relies, in part, on Murray v. Murray, 271 S.C. 62, 246 S.E.2d\r\n  538 (1978) and Gainey v. Gainey, 382 S.C. 414, 675 S.E.2d 792 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009) in support of its position that living separate and apart is not a\r\n  prerequisite for instituting an action for separate maintenance.Â  However, neither\r\n  of those cases is dispositive of the issue before us today.Â  In Murray,\r\n  the parties were still living together at the time they received separate\r\n  maintenance.[5] 271 S.C. at 63-64, 244 S.E.2d at 539.Â  However, the issue before the Court\r\n  was whether the husband condoned the wife's misconduct by remaining in the\r\n  house, not whether he failed to plead the elements of separate maintenance. Id.Â \r\n  Therefore, as we stated at the outset of this opinion, the issue before us is\r\n  one of first impression for the Court. Â It is well-settled that even though an\r\n  appellate court has decided a case containing a certain issue, unless that\r\n  issue was actually raised on appeal those cases are not dispositive. Cf. Breland v. Love Chevrolet Olds, Inc., 339 S.C. 89, 95, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  11, 14 (2000) (&quot;The fact that an appellate court may have decided an\r\n  appeal of a particular type of order on the merits is not dispositive of\r\n  whether the order is appealable when the issue of appealability was not\r\n  raised.&quot;); Wallace v. Interamerican Trust Co., 246 S.C. 563, 569,\r\n  144 S.E.2d 813, 816 (1965) (holding that even though the court previously heard\r\n  interlocutory appeals, issue of whether such orders were actually appealable\r\n  had not been raised).Â  Indeed, the dissent's author has himself recognized this\r\n  principle. See Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 400 n.14, 709 S.E.2d 650,\r\n  660 n.14 (2011) (Pleicones, J., dissenting); Bursey v. S.C. Dep't of Health\r\n    and Envt'l Control, 369 S.C. 176, 190, 631 S.E.2d 899, 907 (2006)\r\n  (Pleicones, J., dissenting) (&quot;[T]he fact that we have applied the APA standard\r\n  in a previous Mining Council appeal where the parties did not contest the\r\n  standard of review does not bind us in this case where the matter is properly\r\n  preserved and presented for our review.&quot;).\r\nAs\r\n  to Gainey, the court of appeals merely held that the issue of the family\r\n  court's authority to approve an agreement for separate maintenance when the\r\n  parties still lived together was not preserved for review. 382 S.C. at 424-25,\r\n  675 S.E.2d at 797.Â  Â Contrary to the dissent's view of Gainey, it did\r\n  not hold that Rule 60(b), SCRCP, is inapplicable to separate maintenance\r\n  decrees even though the parties are residing together; it held that because the\r\n  wife knew they were living together at the time of the hearing, she could have\r\n  raised that issue at the hearing and was therefore barred from raising it afterwards\r\n  pursuant to Rule 60(b). Id.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  are also perplexed by the dissent's belief that our holding somehow discourages\r\n  reconciliation between spouses.Â  It is beyond question that the public policy\r\n  of this State favors the institution of marriage, and it is our belief that\r\n  acrimonious litigation does far less to preserve the marital bond than the\r\n  requirements we impose today.Â  Thus our concern goes beyond the fact that\r\n  parties may institute litigation and then withdraw should they reconcile; it\r\n  extends to the relative ease with which parties might otherwise bring their minor\r\n  disputes into the spotlight of the family court, thereby working irreparable\r\n  damage to the family unit.Â  The potential for unnecessary litigation will work\r\n  more harm to a marriage than the requirement that a spouse's discontent with\r\n  the marriage ordinarily must be sufficient for him or her to leave the marital\r\n  home prior to receiving separate maintenance.\r\n Living separate and\r\n  apart therefore is a prerequisite to petitioning for an award of separate\r\n  maintenance.Â  Because Wife never alleged she was living separate and apart from\r\n  Husband, the family court did not err in dismissing her complaint under Rule\r\n  12(b)(6), SCRCP.\r\nIII.&nbsp; LIS\r\n  PENDENS AND\r\n    ATTORNEY'S FEES\r\n Finally, Wife\r\n  argues the family court erred in cancelling the lis pendens she filed on\r\n  Husband's rental properties and not awarding her attorney's fees.Â  In light of\r\n  our conclusion that she has failed to state a claim, we disagree.\r\nA lis\r\n  pendens essentially is another form of a pleading in a case. Pond Place\r\n    Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 30, 567 S.E.2d 881, 896 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).Â  &quot;It is premised upon and must be filed in time [and] in\r\n  conjunction with an underlying complaint involving an issue of property.&quot; Id.Â \r\n  A lis pendens must be filed &quot;not more than twenty days before the\r\n  filing of the complaint or at any time afterwards.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-11-10\r\n  (2005).Â  It is therefore a derivative right, and its validity depends not only\r\n  on the timeliness of its filing in relation to the underlying complaint, but on\r\n  the validity of the complaint as well.Â  Because we find Wife's complaint fails\r\n  to state a claim, there is no valid complaint on which Wife's lis pendens can be premised.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in cancelling it.\r\nIn\r\n  considering whether to award a party attorney's fees, the court must consider\r\n  the party's ability to pay his own fees, the beneficial results obtained by the\r\n  party's attorney, each party's respective financial conditions, and the effect\r\n  of the fee on each party's standard of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307\r\n  S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  Given our affirmance of the\r\n  family court's dismissal of Wife's complaint, she did not achieve any\r\n  beneficial results.Â  We therefore affirm the court's denial of attorney's fees to\r\n  Wife.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We affirm the order\r\n  of the family court dismissing Wife's complaint for separate maintenance\r\n  because she failed to allege that she and Husband were living separate and\r\n  apart at the time of filing.Â  Furthermore, because Wife's lis pendens and claim for attorney's fees hinge on the validity of her complaint, we find\r\n  no error in the family court's denial of that relief to Wife.\r\n TOAL, C.J., and\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\r\n  in a separate opinion in which BEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I agree with\r\n  the majority that the family court did not find a jurisdictional defect in\r\n  wife's complaint.Â  See Gainey v. Gainey, 382 S.C. 414, 675 S.E.2d\r\n  792 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  I disagree, however, that either as a matter of pleading\r\n  or of policy a married couple must be living separate and apart in order to\r\n  bring an action for separate maintenance and support.Â  I would therefore\r\n  reverse the family court order to the extent it dismissed the complaint and\r\n  cancelled the lis pendens.\r\n Although South\r\n  Carolina did not permit divorce until 1949,[6] the equity courts &quot;without any Legislative act, or other authority, began\r\n  to exercise jurisdiction in case for alimony, Brown vs. Brown, 1\r\n  Eq. R. 196. A.D. 1785,[7] not as in England, as incident to suits for divorce, (for no divorce has ever\r\n  been allowed in this State,) but as a separate and distinct ground for\r\n  equitable relief.Â  Julineau vs. Julineau, 2 Des. 45 A.D.\r\n  1787.&quot;[8]Â  Hair v. Hair, 31 S.C. Eq. (10 Rich. Eq.) 163 (S.C. App. Eq. 1858).Â \r\n  Although originally this equitable relief was available only to those who could\r\n  establish fault that would be grounds for divorce in England, Rhame v. Rhame,\r\n  6 S.C. Eq. (1 McCord Eq.) 197 (S.C. App. 1826), this requirement was relaxed\r\n  overtime, leaving the question whether to grant a decree of separate\r\n  maintenance and support to the court's broad discretion.Â  Machado v. Machado,\r\n  220 S.C. 90, 66 S.E.2d 629 (1951).Â  The equitable authority to grant this\r\n  relief has devolved upon the family court, but remains a matter of discretion,\r\n  not bound by statutory requirements.\r\n This State's long\r\n  established public policy favors preservation of marriage, and encourages and\r\n  promotes reconciliation between spouses.Â  Towles v. Towles, 256 S.C.\r\n  307, 182 S.E.2d 53 (1971).Â  It is &quot;the sundering of the marriage\r\n  ties&quot; which our public policy seeks to avoid by its strict construction of\r\n  the grounds for divorce.Â  E.g. Mincey v. Mincey, 224 S.C. 520, 80\r\n  S.E.2d 123 (1954) (constructive desertion is ground for divorce only where\r\n  leaving spouse left because of other spouse's conduct which amounted to a fault\r\n  ground for divorce); Nolletti v. Nolletti, 243 S.C. 20, 132 S.E.2d 11\r\n  (1963) (spouse must have been deserted for at least a year prior to\r\n  commencement of divorce action on this ground); Shaw v. Shaw, 256 S.C.\r\n  453, 182 S.E.2d 865 (1971) (separation caused by one spouse's insanity cannot\r\n  be basis for divorce).Â  Because our public policy requires that courts strictly\r\n  construe the grounds for divorce, our decisions have been especially concerned\r\n  with preventing collusive divorces.Â  E.g., Brown v. Brown, supra.Â \r\n  Collusiveness is not an issue in a separate maintenance and support action,\r\n  which does not require a fault ground or a physical separation for at least a\r\n  year preceding commencement of a divorce action.Â  \r\n The majority takes\r\n  the State's public policy strongly favoring marriage over divorce, and applies\r\n  it to impose new obstacles to those seeking only separate maintenance and\r\n  support, a non-terminal type of marital litigation which carries with it a\r\n  greater hope of reconciliation.Â  Moreover, because our public policy encourages\r\n  reconciliation, I do not understand the majority's concern with those who\r\n  commence but then withdraw marital litigation.[9]\r\n The majority relies\r\n  in part upon the statutory provision that terminates separate maintenance and\r\n  support awards upon &quot;continual cohabitation.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-130(B)(5) (Supp. 2010).Â  Continual cohabitation is defined as &quot;the\r\n  supported spouse resides with another person in a romantic relationship for a period of ninety consecutive days.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2010) (emphasis supplied).Â  It is not merely living in the same\r\n  residence which is required, but also a romantic relationship, ordinarily with\r\n  a third person (though the resumption of cohabitation with a spouse would have\r\n  the same effect) which provides the statutory basis for ending support.Â  Unlike\r\n  the majority, as I read Â§ 20-3-130(B)(5), the purpose of separate maintenance\r\n  and support is to provide the financial means necessary for the parties to be\r\n  able to live separate and apart, not to require them to already beÂ  living in\r\n  separate residences as a prerequisite to such an action.\r\n I also disagree\r\n  with the majority's decision to &quot;borrow&quot; the requirement that parties\r\n  seeking a divorce based on either desertion or one year's separation must be\r\n  separated when the action is commenced, and import it into a separate\r\n  maintenance and support action as a pleading requirement.Â  I see nothing in our\r\n  precedents or in our rules[10] which require a person plead separation in her separate maintenance and support\r\n  complaint.Â  If anything, precedent and legislation suggest[11] that no such separation is required.Â  Murray v. Murray, 271 S.C. 62, 246\r\n  S.E.2d 538 (1978) (no condonation in separate maintenance and support suit\r\n  where husband stayed in home with wife); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Family\r\n  Court may approve alimony or separate maintenance and support agreementsÂ \r\n  &quot;in actions for divorceâ€¦separate maintenance and support actions, or in\r\n  actions to approve agreement where the parties are living separate and\r\n  apart&quot;); see also Gainey, supra (separate maintenance\r\n  and support decree not subject to Rule 60(b), SCRCP relief even though parties\r\n  resided in same home until day of merits hearing).\r\n In my opinion,\r\n  public policy does not require parties live in separate residences in order to\r\n  bring a separate maintenance and support suit.Â  Instead, I would allow such a\r\n  suit where the parties no longer have a &quot;romantic&quot; relationship.Â  We\r\n  allow a divorce action to be brought where the parties share a residence, Watson, supra, and have allowed a separate maintenance and support suit under\r\n  the same circumstances.Â  Murray, supra.Â  Both Watson and Murray recognize the hardship placed on a parent in a custody situation if the parent\r\n  must leave the home in order to commence marital litigation.Â  In a similar\r\n  vein, public policy should recognize that financial impossibility may prevent a\r\n  spouse from establishing a separate residence prior to receiving court-ordered\r\n  support.Â  We should not deny access to the family court to a party who must, of\r\n  financial necessity, remain in the marital abode.\r\n I would hold that\r\n  living separate and apart is not a prerequisite to the bringing of a separate\r\n  maintenance and support action.Â  I therefore concur in part and dissent in\r\n  part.\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wife stated these proceedings were actions for\r\n  divorce.Â  Husband contends that they were for separate maintenance, not\r\n  divorce.Â  The record before us does not contain any copies of these filings,\r\n  and Wife's attorney simply denominated these prior filings &quot;actions&quot;\r\n  with no further indication of whether a divorce was sought.\r\n[2] All of their children have now attained the age of\r\n  majority.\r\n[3] The night before the hearing in the family court,\r\n  Husband, Wife, and their children &quot;all celebrated a very nice Easter dinner\r\n  as a family at [their] home.&quot;\r\n[4] The dissent extrapolates from Machado and the\r\n  eighteenth century case Brown v. Brown, 1 S.C. Eq. (1 Des.) 196 (1789),\r\n  that the family court's authority to grant this relief arises from its\r\n  equitable powers and not any statutory requirements.Â  South Carolina's family\r\n  court system was created by statute in 1976, and this statutory framework now\r\n  controls.Â  As courts of limited jurisdiction, it is well-settled that family\r\n  courts possess only such powers as are granted to them by statute. Graham,\r\n  340 S.C. at 355, 532 S.E.2d at 263.Â  Accordingly, contrary to the dissent's\r\n  view, the family court's authority emanates from section 20-3-130(B)(5), not\r\n  from any equitable authority vesting the family courts with broad discretion.Â \r\n  While we have refused to define specific grounds for a party to receive\r\n  separate maintenance, those decisions are still valid only because the statute\r\n  itself contains no grounds, not because of the family court's equitable\r\n  jurisdiction.\r\n[5] The opinion states that the parties were granted a\r\n  legal separation.

Wooten, United\r\n  States District Court for the District of South Carolina, of whether the South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and\r\n  Management Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-96-10, et. seq. (2002) (SWPMA),\r\n  preempts Horry County Ordinance 02-09 (2009), entitled &quot;An Ordinance\r\n  Regulating the County-Wide Collection and Disposal of Solid Waste Generated within\r\n  Horry County and for the Prohibition of the Disposal of Solid Waste Materials\r\n  in any Manner Except as Set Forth Herein; and Providing Penalties for Violation\r\n  Thereof.&quot; Â We answer this question in the negative.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn 1976, Congress enacted the Resource Conservation and Recovery\r\n  Act, 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6901, et seq. (1976, as amended) (RCRA), to create a\r\n  long-term solution for managing the increasing levels of solid waste across the\r\n  United States and to address contiguous environmental problems created by\r\n  harmful disposal methods, inadequate landfill capacity, and substandard\r\n  facilities.Â  Id. Â§ 6901(a), (b).Â  The RCRA also mandated the\r\n  promulgation of corresponding guidelines by the Environmental Protection Agency.Â  See, e.g., id. Â§ 6907 (authorizing the promulgation of\r\n  regulations governing solid waste management); id. Â§ 6942(b)\r\n  (authorizing the promulgation of regulations to oversee the creation of state\r\n  solid waste management plans); 40 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 255.1, et seq. (regulations\r\n  applicable to solid waste management); id. 256.01, et seq. (regulations applicable to state solid waste management plans).\r\nIn 1991, as a corollary to the federal guidelines, the General\r\n  Assembly enacted the SWPMA\r\n  after determining a &quot;coordinated statewide management program [was] needed\r\n  to protect public health and safety, protect and preserve the quality of the\r\n  environment, and conserve and recycle natural resources.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 44-96-20(A)(13) (2002).Â  Not only did the General Assembly seek to ensure the\r\n  environmentally sound disposal of certain types of nonhazardous waste in South\r\n  Carolina, but through the SWPMA, the General Assembly also sought to handle the\r\n  practical problems associated with solid waste management by ensuring adequate\r\n  landfill capacity to meet the state's future disposal needs and provide for the\r\n  efficient and economical disposal of waste in the state.Â  See generally S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-20(A)(1)-(14) (listing the General Assembly's policy findings\r\n  necessitating the passage of the SWPMA) and (B)(1)-(14) (listing the objectives\r\n  of the SWPMA from a policy standpoint); 44-96-240(A)(1)-(6) (listing the\r\n  General Assembly's findings necessitating the statewide management of solid\r\n  waste) and (B)(1)-(2) (listing the objectives of the statewide\r\n  management system).Â  The SWPMA mandates the formation of a state solid waste\r\n  management plan by DHEC and requires counties to prepare individual solid waste\r\n  management plans or participate in regional solid waste management plans.[2] Â Id. Â§Â§ 44-96-20(A)(14) (stating\r\n  that a purpose of the SWPMA is to require the creation of solid waste\r\n  management plans), -60 (requiring creation of a state solid waste management\r\n  plan), -80(A) (requiring counties to participate in single county or regional\r\n  solid waste management plans). Â The SWPMA charged DHEC with the task of\r\n  promulgating regulations, which would create new standards governing non-hazardous\r\n  waste disposal practices in the state. Â Id. Â§ 44-96-260 (authorizing\r\n  DHEC to enact regulations); S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107, et seq.\r\n  (solid waste regulations).Â  DHEC has since promulgated regulations which\r\n  govern, inter alia, the\r\n  &quot;minimum standards for the site selection, design, operation, and closure\r\n  of all solid waste landfills and structural fill areas.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. Â§ 61-107.19.I.A.1.Â  Furthermore, the SWPMA authorized DHEC to establish a\r\n  statewide permitting scheme.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-260(2) (authorizing DHEC\r\n  to permit solid waste facilities); id. Â§ 44-96-290 (outlining permitting\r\n  parameters).Â  As part of the permitting process, the SWPMA provides that\r\n  &quot;[n]o permit to construct a new solid waste management facility or to\r\n  expand an existing solid waste facility may be issued until a demonstration of\r\n  need is approved by [DHEC],&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(E), and authorizes DHEC to promulgate regulations governing\r\n  permitting and demonstration of need decisions. Â Id. Â§ 44-96-290(D), (E); see also S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17 (Supp. 2010) (DON Regulation).Â  The DON Regulation\r\n  creates geographic planning areas that DHEC must contemplate when deciding whether\r\n  the projection of solid waste in the area warrants the construction of a new\r\n  landfill at a proposed landfill site or the proposed expansion of an existing landfill.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17.B.10 (defining &quot;planning area&quot;); id. Â§ 61-107.17.D.2 (criteria for determining need).Â  However, planning areas also\r\n  affect the determination of yearly allowable disposal rates at permitted solid\r\n  waste facilities.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§Â§ 61-107.17.D.3.a-b.Â  This calculation\r\n  is partially based on the estimates contained in the county or regional solid\r\n  waste management plans.Â  The SWPMA also requires DHEC to render a consistency determination, of whether or\r\n  not the proposed solid waste facility is consistent with state and county or regional solid\r\n  waste management plans, local zoning and land-use\r\n  ordinances and regulations, any other applicable local\r\n  ordinances, and the buffer requirements contained in other DHEC regulations.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(F); S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17.B.5\r\n  (defining &quot;consistency determination&quot;); id. 61-107.17.C.1\r\n  (providing that a permit will not be granted until the consistency\r\n  determination is approved).\r\nPlaintiffs Sandlands C&amp;D, LLC (Sandlands) and Express Disposal\r\n  Service, LLC (EDS) are related, privately-owned South Carolina companies.Â \r\n  Sandlands owns and operates a landfill in Marion County, approximately two\r\n  miles across the Horry County border, and EDS hauls waste originating in South\r\n  Carolina and North Carolina to Sandlands' landfill.[3]Â  DHEC granted Sandlands a permit to\r\n  accept construction and demolition (C &amp; D) waste[4] at the Marion County site. Â Prior to\r\n  the passage of Horry County Ordinance 02-09 (the Ordinance), Sandlands received\r\n  C &amp; D waste originating in Horry County and hauled by EDS, accounting for a\r\n  large portion of the waste processed at its landfill.\r\nHorry County Council created Defendant Horry County Solid Waste\r\n  Authority, Inc. (HCSWA) in 1990 to manage Horry County's solid waste needs.Â \r\n  Horry County Code 60-90 (1990).Â  The HCSWA, a non-profit corporation, owns and\r\n  operates a municipal solid waste landfill[5] and a C &amp; D landfill, permitted by DHEC, at the same site on Highway 90 in\r\n  Horry County.Â  Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  April 7, 2009,[6] Horry County Council enacted the first ordinance in South Carolina regulating\r\n  the flow[7] of solid waste\r\n\r\nto\r\n  protect the health, safety and general well-being of the citizens of Horry\r\n  County, enhance and maintain the quality of the environment, conserve natural\r\n  resources and to prevent water and air pollution by providing for a\r\n  comprehensive, rational and effective means of regulating the collection and\r\n  disposal of solid waste generated in Horry County and for the prohibition of\r\n  the disposal of any waste materials in any manner except as set forth in this Ordinance.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHorry County Code 02-09, Art.\r\n  I, Â§ 1.1.Â  To this end, the Ordinance\r\n  requires all acceptable solid waste[8] generated within Horry County to be deposited at the HCSWA's landfill or a\r\n  &quot;designated facility.&quot;Â  Id. Art. II, Â§ 2.1.1 (designation); id. Art. VIII, Â§ 8.1.1 (restricting disposal to designated facilities).Â  A\r\n  &quot;designated facility&quot; is defined as &quot;any solid waste\r\n  facility(ies) owned and/or operated by the [HC]SWA and/or public owned\r\n  facilities designated by the [HC]SWA for the acceptance or disposal of solid\r\n  waste and [C &amp; D] debris, including but not limited to, landfills and\r\n  transfer stations.&quot; Â Id. Art. I, Â§ 1.2.9.Â  Any person or hauler\r\n  violating the Ordinance by depositing waste at a non-designated facility is\r\n  subject to penalties. Â Id. Art. VIII, Â§ 8.1.4 (persons); id. Art.\r\n  IX, Â§ 9.1.2 (haulers); id. Art. XI, Â§Â§ 11.1-11.3 (penalties).\r\nQuestion Presented\r\nDoes the SWPMA preempt the\r\n  Horry County Ordinance?\r\nAnalysis\r\nAn ordinance\r\n  &quot;is a legislative enactment and is presumed to be constitutional.&quot;Â  Aakjer\r\n    v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 388 S.C. 129, 133, 694 S.E.2d 213, 215\r\n  (2010) (citing Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v.\r\n    City of Spartanburg, 285 S.C. 495, 497, 331 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1985)).Â  The party challenging a local ordinance bears the\r\n  burden of proving its invalidity.Â  Id.Â  It is mandated in &quot;[t]his State's constitution . . . that\r\n  the powers of local governments should be liberally construed.&quot;Â  Id. (citing S.C. Const. art. VIII Â§ 17).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  have employed a two-step analysis to determine the validity of a local\r\n  ordinance.Â  S.C. State Ports Auth. v. Jasper County, 368 S.C. 388,\r\n  394-95, 629 S.E.2d 624, 627 (2006) (citing Bugsy's,\r\n    Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 87, 93, 530 S.E.2d 890, 893 (2000)).Â \r\n  First, a court must determine &quot;whether the county had the power to enact\r\n  the ordinance.&quot; Â Id. at 395, 629 S.E.2d at 627. Â &quot;If the state\r\n  has preempted a particular area of legislation, then the ordinance is\r\n  invalid,&quot; and &quot;[i]f no such power existed, the ordinance is invalid\r\n  and the inquiry ends.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Where a court finds the county did &quot;ha[ve]\r\n  the power to enact the ordinance,&quot; then it must &quot;ascertain[] whether\r\n  the ordinance is inconsistent with the Constitution or general law of this\r\n  state.&quot;Â  Id. (citations omitted).\r\nI.&nbsp; Authority to Enact the\r\n  Ordinance\r\n Despite Plaintiffs' extensive arguments concerning the question of\r\n  whether Horry County had the authority to enact the Ordinance, the issue is not\r\n  squarely before us, as the single question certified to this Court concerns\r\n  preemption.Â  However, for the sake of providing context to the preemption\r\n  discussion, and because the two questions are inextricably linked in this case,\r\n  we conclude Horry County validly enacted the Ordinance in furtherance of its police\r\n  powers.\r\nRecognizing\r\n  that &quot;[t]he management of solid waste is the inherent responsibility of\r\n  local government, whose authority in this area is derived from its police\r\n  powers,&quot; the Ordinance\r\n  purports &quot;to protect the health, safety, and general well-being of the\r\n  citizens of Horry County, enhance and maintain the quality of the environment,\r\n  conserve natural resources and to prevent water and air pollution by providing\r\n  for a comprehensive, rational and effective means of regulating the collection\r\n  and disposal of waste . . . .&quot;Â  Horry County Code 02-09, Art. I, Â§ 1.1.Â  We note that the mere mention of police\r\n  power rhetoric as part of the preamble to an ordinance does not guarantee that\r\n  a local governmental action is a valid exercise of such powers.Â  See, e.g., Henderson v. City of Greenwood, 172 S.C. 16, 24, 172 S.E. 689, 691 (S.C.\r\n  1934)Â  (&quot;The mere statement in the preamble of an ordinance that is passed\r\n  under the police power does not give a municipality carte blanche to\r\n  pass an unreasonable ordinance or one opposed to the Constitution or laws of\r\n  the state.&quot;) (citations omitted).Â  However, in view of the counties' longstanding involvement in the\r\n  field of solid waste management, we find that the Ordinance\r\n  represents a valid exercise of Horry County's police powers, as articulated in section\r\n  4-9-25 of the South Carolina Code.[9] \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Preemption\r\nWe\r\n  now turn to the thrust of the certified questionâ€”whether the SWPMA preempts the\r\n  Ordinance.Â  As stated previously, an ordinance is invalid if we find that state\r\n  law preempts the area of legislation.Â  Ports Auth., 368 S.C. at 395, 629\r\n  S.E.2d at 627.Â  &quot;To preempt an entire field, an act must make manifest a\r\n  legislative intent that no other enactment may touch upon the subject in any\r\n  way.&quot; Â Id. (citing Town of\r\n    Hilton Head Island v. Fine Liquors, Ltd.,\r\n  302 S.C. 550, 552, 397 S.E.2d 662, 663 (1990)).Â  In South Carolina Ports\r\n    Authority v. Jasper County, we discussed federal preemption concepts and\r\n  premised our finding of no preemption on the basis that the petitioner failed\r\n  to establish express preemption, implied field preemption, and implied conflict\r\n  preemption.Â  368 S.C. at 395-96, 629 S.E.2d at 627-28 (explaining that in\r\n  federal court, preemption may be had on grounds of express preemption, implied\r\n  field preemption, and implied conflict preemption).Â  Likewise, we discuss these\r\n  federal preemption categories here because Plaintiffs contend these same\r\n  categories are substantiated in the present case.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Express Preemption\r\nPlaintiffs argue that the SWPMA expressly subordinates county\r\n  regulation of solid waste management to DHEC, creates a coordinated statewide\r\n  solid waste management system, and mandates regional planning.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  SWPMA and accompanying regulations expressly preempt a county from regulating the\r\n  flow of solid waste within the counties, as required by the Ordinance. \r\n&quot;Express preemption occurs when the General Assembly declares\r\n  in express terms its intention to preclude local action in a given area.&quot;Â  Ports Auth., 368 S.C. at 397, 629 S.E.2d at 628 (citations omitted).\r\nAt the outset, we recognize that the SWPMA imposes a coordinated,\r\n  statewide regulatory scheme overseen at the state level by DHEC.Â  See, e.g.,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-20(A)(13) (&quot;A coordinated statewide solid waste\r\n  management program is needed to protect public health and safety, protect and\r\n  preserve the quality of the environment, and conserve and recycle natural\r\n  resources.&quot;).Â  However, we disagree with Plaintiffs\r\n  concerning the purported scope of the counties' regulatory authority as part of\r\n  this statewide scheme.\r\nThe SWPMA does not prohibit county regulation of solid waste\r\n  management.Â  Plaintiffs urge this Court to adopt a rule whereby DHEC has the\r\n  exclusive authority to regulate the entire field of solid waste management, arguing\r\n  this case is analogous to Southeast\r\n    Resource Recovery, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Health and\r\n    Environmental Control, 358 S.C. 402, 595 S.E.2d 468 (2004).Â  In that case,\r\n  this Court held that DHEC possessed the exclusive authority under the SWPMA to\r\n  make consistency determinations as part of the permitting process, and\r\n  consequently, DHEC could not relinquish this decision to the counties.Â  Id. at 408, 595 S.E.2d at 471.Â  Although\r\n  there is no doubt the express language of the SWPMA provides for DHEC's\r\n  exclusive authority in the area of permitting, see S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 44-96-290(E) (&quot;No permit to construct a new solid waste management\r\n  facility or to expand an existing solid waste management facility may be issued\r\n  until a demonstration of need is approved by the department.&quot;); id. Â§ 44-96-260(2) (DHEC may &quot;issue, deny, revoke, or modify permits,\r\n  registrations, or orders under such conditions as the department may prescribe\r\n  . . . .&quot;), we glean no similar express language in the statute concerning\r\n  the flow of solid waste within the counties.Â  Therefore, Southeastern Resource Recovery is inapposite. \r\nFurthermore, Plaintiffs have not identified any specific provisions of the SWPMA that prohibit Horry County's\r\n  passage of the Ordinance.Â  To the contrary, the SWPMA is laden with references\r\n  to the counties' involvement in the management and regulation of solid waste.Â  See, e.g., 44-96-80(A), (J), (K).Â  Â Likewise, the\r\n  DON Regulation itself contains no express language prohibiting county regulation\r\n  of the flow of waste.[10]Â  But seeÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(F) (Supp. 2010) (&quot;[N]o permit to construct a new solid waste management facility\r\n  or to expand an existing solid waste management facility within a county or\r\n  municipality may be issued by the department unless the proposed facility or\r\n  expansion is consistent with local zoning, land use, and other applicable\r\n    local ordinances, if any[.]&quot;) (emphasis added); S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.B.5.c (requiring consistency\r\n  determinations account for any local ordinances); id. Â§ 61-107.C.1\r\n  (providing DHEC must approve the consistency determination prior to granting a\r\n  permit).Â  Accordingly, we do not find section 44-96-80(K) expressly prohibits\r\n  Horry County from enacting the Ordinance.[11]Â  \r\nNext, Plaintiffs cite a multitude of provisions to support their\r\n  contention that the Ordinance conflicts with the SWPMA's requirement that\r\n  counties adopt a regional approach to solid waste management.[12] Â There is no doubt the SWPMA favors regionalism.\r\n  Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(G) (&quot;Counties are strongly\r\n  encouraged to pursue a regional approach to solid waste management.&quot;). Â However,\r\n  the SWPMA unequivocally tempers the operation of all of the provisions advocating\r\n  for a regional approach with the proviso, found in section 44-96-80(G), that &quot;[n]othing\r\n  in this chapter . . . shall be construed to require a county to participate in\r\n  a regional plan . . . .&quot;Â  Id.Â  The only interpretation supported by\r\n  the plain language of section 44-96-80(G), together with all other provisions\r\n  on the subject, is that the legislature intended the SWPMA to &quot;strongly\r\n    encourage&quot; participation in a regional plan, but not to &quot;require&quot;\r\n  it. Â Id. (emphasis added). This interpretation effectuates the stated\r\n  objectives of the SWPMA of imposing a statewide, coordinated solid waste\r\n  management system and advancing a regional approach to solid waste management,\r\n  yet simultaneously allows for regulation at the local level.Â  The express language\r\n  of the SWPMA and DHEC regulations support this interpretation.Â  Therefore, because Plaintiffs have not cited any\r\n  express language in the SWPMA demonstrating the legislatureâ€™s intent to\r\n  preclude local regulation of the flow of solid waste within the counties, there\r\n  can be no express preemption.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Implied Field\r\n  Preemption\r\nPlaintiffs\r\n  advance a similar argument with respect to implied field\r\n  preemption.Â  Plaintiffs contend that the SWPMA establishes a comprehensive\r\n  statutory scheme for the permitting and siting of landfills that grants DHEC\r\n  exclusive regulatory authority and responsibility for overseeing the field of\r\n  solid waste management, and therefore, the SWPMA impliedly preempts the Ordinance.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nImplied field preemption occurs &quot;when the state statutory\r\n  scheme so thoroughly and pervasively covers the subject so as to occupy the\r\n  field or when the subject mandates statewide uniformity.&quot;Â  Ports Auth.,\r\n  368 S.C. at 397, 629 S.E.2d at 628 (citations omitted).Â  Â Â \r\nPlaintiffs primarily point to section 44-96-80(E) to support their\r\n  contention the SWPMA provides for a statewide coordinated system in the field\r\n  of solid waste management that occupies the entire field, and as a result,\r\n  Horry County's passage of the Ordinance hinders statewide planning and policy.Â \r\n  Section 44-96-80(E) provides: \r\n\r\nEach [county or regional] solid waste management plan submitted pursuant\r\n  to this section shall be consistent with the state solid waste management plan,\r\n  with the provisions of this chapter, with all other applicable provisions of\r\n  state law, and with any regulation promulgated by the department for the\r\n  protection of public health and safety or for protection of the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  S.C.

Â§ 44-96-290(E)\r\n  (2002).\r\nWhile this section requires counties to comply with state law,\r\n  DHEC regulations, and the state solid waste management plan when submitting\r\n  their own county plans, we do not agree that this section demonstrates the\r\n  General Assembly's intent to grant DHEC exclusive regulatory authority over the\r\n  entire field of solid waste management.Â  Where the General Assembly specifically\r\n  recognizes a local government's authority to enact local laws in the same\r\n  field, the statutory scheme does not evidence legislative intent to occupy the\r\n  entire field of regulation.Â  See Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 213, 574 S.E.2d 196, 199\r\n  (2002) (stating &quot;[i]t would have been\r\n  unnecessary for the legislature to refer to municipalities' authority to\r\n  regulate the hours of operation of retail sales of beer and wine if the General\r\n  Assembly intended to occupy the entire field.&quot;); American Vets Post 100 v. Richland\r\n    County Council, 280 S.C. 317, 313 S.E.2d 293 (1984) (where the language of\r\n  the statute contemplated additional regulation of the game of bingo at the\r\n  local level, there was not preemption).Â  The SWPMA is silent with respect to control over the flow of\r\n  local waste generated in the counties and, instead, expressly invites county regulation, planning, authority, and\r\n  responsibility in the field of solid waste management. Â See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 44-96-80(A), (J), (K).Â  Therefore, we find the legislature did not intend for\r\n  DHEC to occupy the entire field of solid waste management.\r\nLikewise, we find that the field of solid waste management does\r\n  not require statewide uniformity.Â  While the SWPMA implements a statewide regulatory\r\n  framework overseen by DHEC, it still provides for flexibility so that the\r\n  counties can address their individualized solid waste needs.Â  The concerns\r\n  about compliance with local regulations and the passage of conflicting local\r\n  ordinances that were present in Aakjer v. City of Myrtle Beach are not\r\n  present in this case.Â  See Aakjer, 388 S.C. at 134, 694 S.E.2d at 215\r\n  (finding statewide uniformity was necessary after Myrtle Beach enacted a\r\n  municipal ordinance requiring all motorcycle riders to wear helmets and eyewear\r\n  within city limits (where such requirements were not mandated by state law)\r\n  because inconsistent and conflicting local regulations would burden individuals\r\n  seeking to conform to these requirements when riding their motorcycles across\r\n  the state).Â  To the contrary, in the solid waste field, statewide uniformity is\r\n  not necessarily beneficial, given the various solid waste needs specific to each\r\n  county, which differ in size, geography, and population.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden\r\n  with respect to implied field preemption.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Implied Conflict Preemption\r\nPlaintiffs contend that the Ordinance clearly hinders the purpose\r\n  of the SWPMA because it obstructs the SWPMA's policy of mandating a regional\r\n  approach to solid waste management and interferes with the DON Regulation's\r\n  planning formula for adequate landfill capacity in the state.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;[Implied] [c]onflict preemption occurs when the ordinance\r\n  hinders the accomplishment of the statuteâ€™s purpose or when the ordinance\r\n  conflicts with the statute such that compliance with both is impossible.&quot;Â  Ports Auth., 368 S.C. at 400, 629 S.E.2d at 630 (citations omitted). Â Generally,\r\n  additional regulation that merely supplements state law does not result in a\r\n  conflict.Â  Denene, 352 S.C. at 214, 574 S.E.2d at 199 (citations\r\n  omitted).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn order for there to be a conflict between a state statute and a\r\n  municipal ordinance &quot;both must contain either express or implied\r\n  conditions which are inconsistent or irreconcilable with each other. Mere differences in detail do not render them conflicting.\r\n  If either is silent where the other speaks, there can be no conflict between\r\n  them. Where no conflict exists, both laws stand.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Town of Hilton Head, 302 S.C. at 553, 397 S.E.2d at 664).\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly enacted the SWPMA, in relevant part, to:\r\n(1) protect the public health and safety, protect and preserve the\r\n  environment of this State, and recover resources which have the potential for\r\n  further usefulness by providing for, in the most environmentally safe,\r\n  economically feasible and cost-effective manner, the storage, collection,\r\n  transport, separation, treatment, processing, recycling, and disposal of solid\r\n  waste; \r\n(2) establish and maintain a cooperative state program for\r\n  providing planning assistance, technical assistance, and financial assistance\r\n  to local governments for solid waste management; \r\n(3) require local governments to adequately plan for and provide\r\n  efficient, environmentally acceptable solid waste management services and\r\n  programs; \r\n(4) promote the establishment of resource recovery systems that\r\n  preserve and enhance the quality of air, water, and land resources; \r\n  (5) ensure that solid waste is transported, stored, treated,\r\n  processed, and disposed of in a manner adequate to protect human health,\r\n  safety, and welfare and the environment;&nbsp;\r\nâ€¦.\r\n(7) encourage local governments to utilize\r\n  all means reasonably available to promote efficient and proper methods of\r\n  managing solid waste, which may include contracting with private entities \r\n  to provide management services or operate management facilities on\r\n  behalf of the local government, when it is cost effective to do so;&nbsp;\r\nâ€¦.\r\n(13) require local governments and state\r\n  agencies to determine the full cost of providing storage, collection, transport,\r\n  separation, treatment, recycling, and disposal of solid waste in an\r\n  environmentally safe manner; and \r\n(14) encourage local governments to pursue\r\n  a regional approach to solid waste management, \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-96-20(B)(1)-(5), (7), (13), (14), and to:\r\n\r\n(1) regulate solid waste management facilities other than hazardous\r\n  waste management facilities . . . ; and\r\n(2) ensure\r\n  that all solid waste management facilities in this State are sited, designed,\r\n  constructed, operated, and closed in a manner that protects human health and\r\n  safety and the environment,\r\n\r\nid. Â§ 44-96-240(B)(1)-(2).Â  The\r\n  Ordinance does not conflict with any of these enumerated purposes, either\r\n  directly or impliedly.Â  \r\nPlaintiffs primarily argue that the Ordinance conflicts with\r\n  statewide planning by inhibiting the implementation of the DON Regulation,\r\n  which Plaintiffs argue mandates a regional approach to solid waste management\r\n  in the State.Â  As evidence of the conflict between the Ordinance and the General\r\n  Assembly's intent to advance a regional approach to solid waste management, Plaintiffs\r\n  point to the 75-mile wide planning radius for Class Three Landfills (which\r\n  includes municipal solid waste facilities), and the increase in the planning\r\n  area for Class Two Landfills (which includes C &amp; D landfills) from the\r\n  previously authorized 10-mile radius to a 20-mile planning radius.[13] Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  61-107.17.C.3 (listing the planning areas for the landfill classes).Â  Specifically,\r\n  Plaintiffs claim that because these planning areas extend beyond county borders\r\n  across the state, especially in the case of the municipal solid waste\r\n  facilities, the Ordinance conflicts with the legislature's intent to require\r\n  regional planning.Â  For example, Plaintiffs argue, some counties are prohibited\r\n  from hosting municipal solid waste facilities due to the restrictions of the\r\n  DON Regulation.Â  Plaintiffs also contend that the increase in size of planning\r\n  areas for Class Two landfills further demonstrates the legislature's intent to\r\n  promote regional planning in the field of solid waste management.\r\nWe reiterate that the SWPMA merely encourages a regional\r\n  approach to solid waste management while at the same time explicitly allowing\r\n  single-county planning. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(G).Â  Therefore,\r\n  we disagree with Plaintiffs to the extent they argue that the requirements of\r\n  the DON Regulation mandate regionalism and foreclose county regulation of the\r\n  flow of solid waste.Â  There is no correlation between demonstration of need\r\n  decisions and the ultimate destination of collected waste within a planning\r\n  area. Â The planning radius merely serves to pinpoint the permissible location\r\n  of a new facility. Â S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17.D.2.a (requiring that no\r\n  more than two landfills overlap in their respective planning areas).Â  On the\r\n  other hand, the rate of waste generated within a particular planning area is\r\n  used to calculate the maximum allowable waste that may be disposed of at a particular\r\n  facility per year, subject to increases as allowed under the DON Regulation.Â  Id. Â§ 61-107.17.D.3.a-b (calculating facilities' maximum capacity); id. 61-107.17.D.3.c-d (outlining how to obtain increases).Â  This number is based in\r\n  part on the overall disposal rates within a particular county or region, as compiled\r\n  in the various county or regional solid waste management plans.Â  However, there\r\n  is no nexus between the location where collected waste is deposited and these\r\n  calculations.Â  We note further that the SWPMA allows (and encourages) counties\r\n  not able to host a certain type of landfill to join with other counties to form\r\n  regional solid waste plans.Â  Moreover, solid waste facilities do not receive\r\n  waste exclusively from their own planning areas, so even when facilities cannot\r\n  host a certain type of landfill, that waste may still be transported to\r\n  landfills across the state.[14]Â \r\n  In our view, the DON Regulation serves as a planning tool to ensure the state\r\n  is prepared to meet the waste disposal needs of the population by providing adequate\r\n  landfill capacity and to assist the counties in that endeavor.Â  See 44-96-20(B)(2) (stating the purpose of the SWPMA is to &quot;establish and\r\n  maintain a cooperative state program for providing planning assistance,\r\n  technical assistance, and financial assistance to local governments for solid\r\n  waste management&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the Ordinance does not inhibit the\r\n  operation of the DON regulation or encroach on DHEC's permitting authority.Â Â  Â \r\nWhile the SWPMA provides for a statewide management system, it\r\n  also places the onus on the counties to plan and provide for solid waste\r\n  collection and disposal at the local level.Â  Horry County's passage of an ordinance regulating the flow\r\n  of waste neither frustrates the purpose of the SWPMA, nor interferes with need\r\n  determination for landfill permitting pursuant to the DON Regulation.Â \r\n  Compliance with both the Ordinance and the SWPMA is undoubtedly possible. Therefore,\r\n  we find that the Ordinance is not preempted under the implied conflict\r\n  analysis. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Inconsistency\r\n  with the Constitution or General Law\r\nFinally, we turn to whether the Ordinance is &quot;inconsistent with the Constitution or general law of\r\n  this state.&quot;Â  Ports Auth., 368 S.C. at 394-95, 629 S.E.2d at 627 (citing Hospitality Ass'n, 320 S.C. at 224, 464 S.E.2d at 117).Â  Plaintiffs contend that the Ordinance directly conflicts\r\n  with section 44-55-1020 of the South Carolina Code because that section allows\r\n  individual generators of waste and municipalities to dispose of waste in any\r\n  manner allowed by the county health departments, and the Ordinance requires\r\n  disposal of solid waste at a facility designated by Horry County Council. \r\nPlaintiffs' reliance on this section is specious.Â  The Ordinance\r\n  was not enacted with section 44-55-1020 in mind,[15] and because the Ordinance does not\r\n  pertain to Horry County's authority to issue licenses and franchises for the\r\n  collection and disposal of waste under sections 44-55-1010 to -60, section\r\n  44-55-1020 has no bearing on the question of the Ordinance's validity in this\r\n  case.[16]Â \r\n  Â \r\nHaving determined that the Ordinance does not conflict with the\r\n  SWPMA or DHEC regulations, which allow for county regulation of solid waste, we\r\n  find the Ordinance is not inconsistent with section 44-55-1020.Â  Plaintiffs\r\n  have not directed us to any other inconsistent statutory or constitutional\r\n  provisions.Â  Therefore, the Ordinance is a valid exercise of Horry County's\r\n  authority. \r\nConclusion\r\n Based\r\n  on the foregoing, we find that the Solid Waste Policy and Management Act does\r\n  not preempt Horry County Ordinance 02-09.\r\n PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Rule 244(a), SCACR, permits the Court to &quot;answer\r\n  questions of law certified to it by any federal court of the United States . .\r\n  . when requested by the certifying court if there are involved in any\r\n  proceeding before that court questions of law of this state which may be\r\n  determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court when it appears\r\n  to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of\r\n  the Supreme Court.&quot; \r\n[2] To summarize, the SWPMA requires a county or regional\r\n  solid waste management plan to include, in relevant part: an estimate of the\r\n  rate of solid waste disposal at facilities within the county or region at the\r\n  effective date of the SWPMA and during the subsequent twenty-year period, an\r\n  estimate of the existing capacity and remaining lifespan of the existing landfills\r\n  in the county or region, an estimate of the number of facilities needed to\r\n  dispose of waste generated within the county or region within the projected\r\n  twenty-year period, the estimated cost of executing the proposed solid waste plan,\r\n  the revenue needed to fund the waste management plan in the future and the\r\n  monies available for that purpose, and the estimated cost of constructing new\r\n  solid waste management facilities as they become necessary during the\r\n  twenty-year period and revenues that can be made available to fund those\r\n  projects.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(A)(1)-(7).\r\n[3] The close relationship between Sandlands and EDS is customary in the industry,\r\n  ensuring reduced tipping fees for the hauler and a steady stream of waste flow\r\n  and income for the solid waste facility.\r\n[4] DHEC classifies landfills that accept C &amp; D waste as Class Two landfills.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.19.IV (outlining requirements for this\r\n  classification). \r\n[5] DHEC classifies landfills that accept municipal solid waste as Class Three\r\n  landfills.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.19.V (outlining\r\n  requirements for this classification).\r\n[6] The Ordinance became effective on June 1, 2009. \r\n[7] The concept of &quot;flow control&quot; refers to the requirement that waste\r\n  generated and collected within a particular area be deposited at a specific\r\n  location for disposal.\r\n[8] &quot;Acceptable waste&quot; includes C &amp; D and municipal solid waste.Â  Id. Art. I, Â§ 1.2.1.Â  The Ordinance excludes &quot;unacceptable waste,&quot; which\r\n  it defines as &quot;sewage and its derivatives, agricultural waste, biomedical\r\n  waste, special nuclear or by-product materials . . . and hazardous\r\n  waste.&quot;Â  Id. Art. I, Â§ 1.2.14.Â  Under the Ordinance, &quot;solid\r\n  waste&quot; is defined as &quot;garbage, refuse, litter, rubbish or other waste\r\n  resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural or household activities not\r\n  disposable by means of sewage system operated in accordance with state and\r\n  federal regulations,&quot;Â  id. Art. I, Â§ 1.2.13, and &quot;waste&quot;\r\n  is defined as &quot;solid waste, C &amp; D waste, biomedical waste, hazardous\r\n  waste, agricultural waste and septic tank sludge, and includes both acceptable\r\n  and unacceptable wastes,&quot; id. Art. I, Â§ 1.2.15.\r\n[9] Trash collection and\r\n  disposal historically has been a regular duty of local governments.Â  In 1956,\r\n  the General Assembly first statutorily authorized regulation of the field by\r\n  the counties through the issuance of licenses and franchises for the collection\r\n  and disposal of solid waste.Â  See Act No. 809, 1956 S.C. Acts 1837 (codified\r\n    at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-55-1010 to -1060 (Supp. 2010)).Â  In 1974, the\r\n  General Assembly further authorized the counties to participate in collecting\r\n  and disposing of solid waste through the employment of county employees or by\r\n  contract with municipalities or private entities, to levy charges for any\r\n  services provided, and to again promulgate any necessary regulations.Â  See Act No. 886, 1974 S.C. Acts 1941 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  44-55-1210-1230 (Supp. 2010)).Â  \r\nWith\r\n  the advent of &quot;home rule&quot; legislation in this state, the General\r\n  Assembly in 1989 enacted section 4-9-25 of the South Carolina Code, which\r\n  states:\r\n\r\nAll counties of the State, in addition to the powers conferred to\r\n  their specific form of government [under section 4-9-30], have authority to\r\n  enact regulations, resolutions, and ordinances, not inconsistent with the\r\n  Constitution and general law of this State, including the exercise of these\r\n  powers in relation to health and order in counties or respecting any subject as\r\n  appears to them necessary and proper for the security, general welfare, and\r\n  convenience of counties or for preserving health, peace, order, and good\r\n  government in them. The powers of a county must be liberally construed in favor\r\n  of the county and the specific mention of particular powers may not be\r\n  construed as limiting in any manner the general powers of counties.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-25\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  The broad delegation of power under this section &quot;is\r\n  limited only by the requirement that the regulation, resolution, or ordinance\r\n  be consistent with the Constitution and general law of this State.&quot;Â  Hospitality\r\n    Ass'n of S.C., Inc. v. County of Charleston, 320 S.C. 219, 226, 464 S.E.2d\r\n  113, 118 (1995).\r\n[10] Because the DON Regulation contains no express\r\n  language prohibiting the Ordinance, we discuss Plaintiffs' arguments\r\n  concerning the operation of the DON Regulation in the context of implied\r\n  conflict preemption, infra.\r\n[11] Section 44-96-80(K)\r\n  provides: \r\n\r\nThe governing body of a county is authorized to enact such\r\n  ordinances as may be necessary to carry out its responsibilities under this\r\n  chapter; provided, however, that the governing body of a county may not enact\r\n  an ordinance inconsistent with the state solid waste management plan, with any\r\n  provision of this chapter, with any other applicable provision of state law, or\r\n  with any regulation promulgated by the department providing for the protection\r\n  of public health and safety or for protection of the environment.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(K)\r\n  (2002).\r\n[12] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-20(B)(14) (stating\r\n  that a goal of the SWPMA is to &quot;encourage local governments to pursue a\r\n  regional approach to solid waste management&quot;); id. Â§ 44-96-50(C)\r\n  (similarly providing that &quot;[i]t is the policy of this State to encourage a\r\n  regional approach to solid waste management[]&quot;); id.

Â§ 44-96-240(6) (2002) (&quot;A regional approach to the establishment of solid\r\n  waste management facilities should be strongly encouraged in order to provide\r\n  solid waste management services in the most efficient and cost-effective manner\r\n  and to minimize any threat to human health and safety or to the\r\n  environment.&quot;); id.

Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.19.A.1 (Supp. 2010) (preamble).Â  These changes\r\n  were meant to &quot;reduce the number of potential locations for new solid\r\n  waste facilities and help to reduce and install a cap on the over-all allowable\r\n  disposal rate in the State while ensuring an adequate number of facilities\r\n  throughout the State to meet disposal needs.&quot;Â  Id.; see also S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17 (Supp. 2008) (2000 DON Regulation); id. Â§ 61-100 (DHEC's prior mechanism for determining need, deemed unconstitutional\r\n  in Northeast Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Health\r\n    and Environmental Control, 843 F. Supp. 100 (D.S.C. 1992)).Â  \r\n[14] Both Sandlands and the HCSWA accept waste from\r\n  outside their planning areas.\r\n[15] Horry County Council\r\n  enacted the Ordinance pursuant to section 44-55-1210 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code, see Horry County Code 02-09, Art. II, which provides: \r\n\r\nThe governing body of any county may by ordinance or resolution\r\n  provide that the county shall engage in the collection and disposal of solid\r\n  waste. Such collection and disposal may be accomplished either by use of county\r\n  employees and equipment or by contract with private agencies or municipalities\r\n  of the county. Service charges may be levied against persons for whom\r\n  collection services are provided whether such services are performed by the\r\n  county, a municipality or a private agency.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-55-1210\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  The Ordinance is obviously not prohibited by the plain language\r\n  of this section.\r\n[16] We also note that the individual county health\r\n  departments have since fallen under the regulatory authority of DHEC.Â  Since\r\n  DHEC began regulating solid waste management pursuant to the SWPMA, the agency has limited the operation of section 44-55-1020 through,\r\n  for example, prohibiting individuals or municipalities to engage in &quot;open\r\n  dumping,&quot; defined as &quot;any unpermitted or\r\n  unregistered solid waste disposal or land filling activity,&quot; S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. Â§Â§ 61-107.I.A.8 and 61-107.I.B.53, and requiring collectors of\r\n  municipal solid waste to &quot;ultimately dispose of solid waste at facilities\r\n  and/or sites permitted or registered by [DHEC] for processing or disposal of\r\n  that waste stream,&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Regs.

Edward Welmaker, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 27043\r\nHeard April 5, 2011 - Filed September 19,\r\n  2011Â Â \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBlake\r\n  A. Hewitt and John S. Nichols, both of Bluestein, Nichols Thompson, of Columbia,\r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney\r\n  General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\nAssistant\r\n  Attorney General William M. Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia, and Solicitor W.\r\n  Walter Wilkins, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Appellant was convicted of two counts of committing a lewd act\r\n  upon a minor and was sentenced to fifty-five months' imprisonment for the first\r\n  charge and fifteen years, suspended upon the service of fifty months and three\r\n  years' probation for the second charge, with the sentences to run consecutively.Â \r\n  Appellant appeals his convictions, arguing the trial court erred in allowing\r\n  the State to introduce the written reports of a forensic interviewer.Â  We\r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was a neighbor of the three minor alleged victims\r\n  (&quot;oldest child,&quot; &quot;middle child,&quot; and &quot;youngest child&quot;),\r\n  aged eleven, nine, and six, respectively.Â  Although the children described\r\n  appellant as a friend and grandfather figure, all claimed he inappropriately\r\n  touched them on numerous occasions.Â  According to the children, appellant would\r\n  typically start out by rubbing their backs underneath their shirts, and would\r\n  eventually put his hand down their pants, underneath their underwear.\r\nMiddle child first reported appellant's actions to her parents after\r\n  she returned from a bike ride with appellant.Â  According to middle child, she\r\n  became upset when appellant asked her if she liked it when he rubbed her back.Â \r\n  She claimed she returned to her house and told her mother what appellant had\r\n  been doing to her.Â  Following middle child's revelation, the other two children\r\n  claimed appellant had also touched them inappropriately.\r\nAppellant admitted he developed a friendly relationship with the children\r\n  and that he had engaged in incidental physical contact with them from time to\r\n  time.Â  He vehemently denied, however, touching any of them inappropriately.\r\nForensic interviewer Shauna Galloway-Williams interviewed each of\r\n  the children.Â  The State called her as its first witness and asked her to\r\n  briefly summarize what each of the victims told her during the interviews.Â \r\n  Appellant objected, and the trial court sustained the objection.Â  The State\r\n  then moved to admit the forensic interviewer's written reports into evidence.Â \r\n  Over appellant's objection, the trial court allowed the written reports into\r\n  evidence.\r\nThe written reports contain several sections of information.Â  Each\r\n  report contains a &quot;Background Information&quot; section, including\r\n  identical descriptions of when the family moved to South Carolina and how they\r\n  began to interact with appellant.Â  This section also contains the mother's\r\n  account of her conversation with middle child during which middle child\r\n  revealed appellant had been abusing her.Â  For instance, the reports state that mother\r\n  told the forensic interviewer that middle child told mother that appellant\r\n  touched middle child inappropriately, and that middle child did not like it\r\n  when appellant touched her.Â  The reports also state that mother told the\r\n  forensic interviewer that the other children told mother that appellant had\r\n  also touched them inappropriately.Â  Each report also contains a section\r\n  entitled &quot;Regarding Allegations of Abuse&quot; in which the forensic\r\n  interviewer outlines the children's accounts of the alleged abuse by appellant\r\n  provided in the interviews.\r\nFinally, each report contains a section entitled &quot;Conclusion\r\n  of interview,&quot; where the forensic interviewer states that the children\r\n  &quot;provide[d] a compelling disclosure of abuse by [appellant].&quot;Â  The\r\n  reports further conclude that each of the children provided details consistent\r\n  with the background information received from their mother, the police report,\r\n  and the other two children. \r\nLater in the forensic interviewer's testimony, the Court allowed\r\n  the State to play videos of each of the three interviews.Â  After the videos\r\n  were played, all three children testified that appellant abused them in the\r\n  manner described in the forensic interviews.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n     Did the trial court\r\n  err in allowing the State to introduce written reports from the children's interviews?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n     Did the trial court\r\n  err in allowing the State to introduce videos of the children's interviews\r\n  before the children had testified?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C.\r\n  545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002) (citations omitted).Â  â€œAn abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law or,\r\n  when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Clark\r\n    v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000) (citation\r\n  omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Admissibility of\r\n  written reports\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to\r\n  introduce the forensic interviewer's written reports from her interviews with\r\n  the children.Â  Specifically, appellant argues the reports contained\r\n  inadmissible hearsay that improperly bolstered the children's testimony, that\r\n  they impermissibly allowed the forensic interviewer to vouch for the\r\n  credibility of the children, and that their admission was not harmless beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.Â  We agree.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Written reports\r\n  as inadmissible hearsay\r\nAppellant first argues the trial court erred in allowing the State\r\n  to introduce the reports because they constituted impermissible hearsay, which\r\n  improperly bolstered the children's testimony.\r\nHearsay is defined as &quot;a statement, other than one made by the\r\n  declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to\r\n  prove the truth of the matter asserted.&quot;Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Hearsay is\r\n  inadmissible except as provided by the South Carolina Rules of Evidence, by\r\n  other court rule, or by statute.Â  Rule 802, SCRE.\r\n&quot;Improper admission of hearsay testimony constitutes\r\n  reversible error only when the admission causes prejudice.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Garner, 389 S.C. 61, 67, 697 S.E.2d 615, 618 (Ct. App. 2010).Â  Such error\r\n  is deemed harmless when it could not have reasonably affected the result of\r\n  trial, and an appellate court will not set aside a conviction for such\r\n  insubstantial errors.Â  Id.\r\nImproperly admitted hearsay which is merely cumulative to other\r\n  evidence may be viewed as harmless.Â  State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324,\r\n  329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978).Â  &quot;Improper corroboration testimony that\r\n  is merely cumulative to the victim's testimony, however, cannot be\r\n  harmless, because it is precisely this cumulative effect which enhances the\r\n  devastating impact of improper corroboration.&quot;Â  Jolly v. State, 314\r\n  S.C. 17, 21, 443 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1994) (emphasis in original); see also Smith v. State, 386 S.C. 562, 689 S.E.2d 629 (2010) (forensic\r\n  interviewer's hearsay testimony impermissibly corroborated the victim's\r\n  testimony because the outcome of the case hinged on the victim's credibility\r\n  regarding the identification of the perpetrator); Dawkins v. State, 346\r\n  S.C. 151, 154, 551 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2001) (defendant was entitled to\r\n  post-conviction relief where four witnesses testified without objection\r\n  regarding the victim's out-of-court conversations with them concerning the\r\n  alleged abuse).\r\nAppellant specifically challenges the portions of the report where\r\n  the mother related to Williams that the middle child told her appellant\r\n  molested her and specific things the victims told the forensic interviewer during\r\n  the interviews.Â  We find these portions of the written reports constitute\r\n  inadmissible hearsay as they were out-of-court statements offered to prove that\r\n  appellant did in fact inappropriately touch the girls in the way that they\r\n  claimed.\r\nWe also find the trial court's error in allowing the State to\r\n  introduce this evidence was not harmless.Â  This trial hinged on the children's\r\n  credibility, and the written reports were cumulative to the children's\r\n  testimony.Â  As this Court has held before, where credibility is the ultimate\r\n  issue in a case, improper corroboration evidence that is merely cumulative to\r\n  the victim's testimony is not harmless.Â  Jolly, supra; Dawkins, supra; Smith, supra.Â  Because the children's credibility\r\n  was the ultimate determination for the jury to make in deciding appellant's\r\n  guilt, the trial court's error in admitting the reports could not have been\r\n  harmless.Â  Id.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Improper\r\n  vouching\r\nAppellant also argues the trial court erred in allowing the State\r\n  to introduce the written reports because they improperly vouched for the\r\n  victims' credibility.Â  Specifically, appellant challenges the conclusion\r\n  section of the reports where the forensic interviewer states the children\r\n  provided a &quot;compelling disclosure of abuse&quot; and provided details\r\n  consistent with the background information received from mother, the police\r\n  report, and the other two children.\r\nFor an expert to comment on the veracity of a child's accusations\r\n  of sexual abuse is improper.Â  See State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386,\r\n  393-94, 377 S.E.2d 298, 302 (1989) (finding therapist indicating he believed\r\n  victim's allegations were genuine was improper); see also State\r\n    v. Dempsey, 340 S.C. 565, 571, 532 S.E.2d 306, 309 (Ct.App.2000) (finding\r\n  therapist's testimony children were being truthful in ninety-five percent of\r\n  instances in which sexual abuse was alleged was improper vouching for child); but see State v. Douglas, 380 S.C. 499, 671 S.E.2d 606 (2009)\r\n  (forensic interviewer did not vouch for the victim's veracity where she never\r\n  stated she believed the victim and gave no other indication concerning the\r\n  victim's veracity).\r\nWe find the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the\r\n  State to introduce the reports because they allowed the forensic interviewer to\r\n  improperly vouch for the children's veracity.Â  In each report, the forensic\r\n  interviewer stated that during the interviews, each child had &quot;provide[d]\r\n  a compelling disclosure of abuse by [appellant].&quot;Â  The forensic\r\n  interviewer further concluded that each of the children provided details\r\n  consistent with the background information received from their mother, the\r\n  police report, and the other children.Â  There is no other way to interpret the\r\n  language used in the reports other than to mean the forensic interviewer believed\r\n  the children were being truthful.Â  We therefore find the trial court erred in\r\n  allowing the State to introduce the reports.Â  Dawkins, supra; Dempsey, supra.\r\nWe further find the trial court's admission of the reports did not\r\n  amount to harmless error.Â  There was no physical evidence presented in this\r\n  case.Â  The only evidence presented by the State was the children's accounts of\r\n  what occurred and other hearsay evidence of the children's accounts.Â  Because\r\n  the children's credibility was the most critical determination of this case, we\r\n  find the admission of the written reports was not harmless.Â  See State\r\n    v. Ellis, 345 S.C. 175, 178, 547 S.E.2d 490, 492 (2001) (&quot;An officer's\r\n  improper opinion which goes to the heart of the case is not harmless.&quot;).\r\nII.&nbsp; Timing of videos'\r\n  introduction\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to\r\n  introduce the videos of the interviews before the children had testified.Â \r\n  Specifically, appellant argues allowing the videos to be introduced at that\r\n  time violated his constitutional rights to due process and confrontation.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAn out-of-court statement of a child under the age of 12 may be\r\n  admissible under certain circumstances.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-175\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  Section 17-23-175 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(A) In a general sessions court proceeding . . . an out-of-court\r\n  statement of a child is admissible if:\r\n  \r\n(1) the statement was given in response to questioning conducted\r\n  during an investigative interview of the child; \r\n(2) an audio and visual recording of the statement is preserved on\r\n  film, videotape, or other electronic means, except as provided in subsection\r\n  (F); \r\n(3) the child testifies at the proceeding and is subject to cross-\r\n  examination on the elements of the offense and the making of the out-of-court\r\n  statement; and \r\n(4) the court finds, in a hearing conducted outside the presence\r\n  of the jury, that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of\r\n  the statement provides particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n Prior\r\n  to trial, the State requested a ruling on the introduction of the videos of\r\n  the victims' interviews with Williams, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-175\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  While appellant did not challenge the admissibility of the\r\n  videos, he did argue that, under the statute, the videos could not be\r\n  introduced before the victims testified.Â  Specifically, appellant argued\r\n  the statute &quot;contemplates [the victims] be subject to cross-examination\r\n  before the [videos] come in.&quot;Â  Appellant did not, however, make any\r\n  constitutional arguments in support of his objection.Â  After reviewing the\r\n  statute, the trial court allowed the State to introduce the video prior to the\r\n  victims' testimony, with the understanding that the victims would in fact be\r\n  called upon to testify. \r\nAn objection must be made on a specific ground.Â  State v.\r\n  Stahlnecker, 386 S.C. 609, 617, 690 S.E.2d 565, 570 (2010) (citing State\r\n    v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997)).Â  For an issue\r\n  to be properly preserved it has to be raised to and ruled on by the trial\r\n  court.Â  Id.Â  This rule also applies to constitutional arguments.Â  See State v. Owens, 378 S.C. 636, 664 S.E.2d 80 (2008) (confrontation clause\r\n  and due process arguments not preserved for review). Â Â Accordingly, the\r\n  argument now made on appeal, that appellant's constitutional rights were\r\n  violated, is not preserved for this Court's review.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n The trial court erred\r\n  in allowing the State to introduce the forensic interviewer's written reports\r\n  because they contained impermissible hearsay, vouched for the children's\r\n  credibility, and their admission was not harmless.Â  Accordingly, appellant's\r\n  convictions are\r\n REVERSED.\r\nBEATTY, J.\r\n  concurs. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a separate opinion in which HEARN, J.,\r\n  concurs. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  I concur in result, but agree with\r\n  Chief Justice Toal that the apparent categorical rule emanating from Jolly\r\n    v. State and its progeny precluding a finding of harmless error goes too\r\n  far.Â  314 S.C. 17, 21, 443 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1994) (stating that &quot;[i]mproper\r\n  corroboration testimony that is merely cumulative to the victim's testimony&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;cannot\r\n  be harmless . . . .&quot;) (emphasis in original).Â  In my judgment, it may be a\r\n  rare occurrence for the State to prove harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n  in these circumstances.Â  But these determinations are necessarily context\r\n  dependent, and a categorical rule is at odds with longstanding harmless error\r\n  jurisprudence.Â  Cf. Huggler v. State, 360 S.C. 627,\r\n  634-36, 602 S.E.2d 753, 757-58 (2004) (holding in a\r\n  post-conviction relief matter arising from a criminal sexual conduct conviction\r\n  that defense counsel's failure to object to the admission of written witness\r\n  statements that went beyond time and place of the alleged sexual assault fell\r\n  below an objective standard of reasonableness, but counsel's failure to object\r\n  had not prejudiced the defendant's case &quot;[i]n light of the overwhelming\r\n  evidence presented by the State&quot; and &quot;[t]he evidence of abuse was\r\n  overwhelming even without the content in the [improperly admitted] written\r\n  statements.&quot;).\r\nI have reviewed the evidence,\r\n  including the video interviews of the children.Â  While a close question may be\r\n  presented, I cannot say the improper vouching and admission of the forensic\r\n  interviewer's written reports were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Â There\r\n  is a lack of overwhelming evidence of guilt apart from the State's regrettable\r\n  desire to admit patently inadmissible evidence.Â  Accordingly, I join the\r\n  majority in voting to reverse.\r\n HEARN, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n CHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  While I agree with the majority's\r\n  disposition of Appellant's argument regarding the timing of the introduction of\r\n  the videos, I disagree with the majority regarding the prejudicial nature of\r\n  the forensic interviewer's written reports.Â  I would hold that the admission of\r\n  the written reports was harmless error and that the reports did not vouch for\r\n  the children's veracity.\r\n The\r\n  majority points to a string of cases to support the assertion that improperly\r\n  admitted hearsay testimony that is merely cumulative to the victim's testimony\r\n  can never be harmless error.Â  See Smith v. State, 386 S.C. 562,\r\n  689 S.E.2d 629 (2010); Dawkins v. State, 346 S.C. 151, 551 S.E.2d 260\r\n  (2001); Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17, 443 S.E.2d 566 (1994).Â  I do not\r\n  dispute that our cases say as much, but I do disagree with those holdings.Â \r\n  Although I concurred in the Jolly opinion, I have come to believe that\r\n  the Jolly case and its progeny go too far, and consequently, I believe\r\n  we should take this opportunity to overrule Jolly.Â  In my opinion, these\r\n  cases create a rule of per se prejudice when testimony is cumulative to the\r\n  victim's testimony.Â  Such a rule is contrary to the traditional analysis of\r\n  improperly admitted hearsay testimony, which requires a finding of prejudice.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 288, 625 S.E.2d 641, 646 (2006)\r\n  (&quot;The improper admission of hearsay is reversible error only when the\r\n  admission causes prejudice.&quot;).Â  \r\n In\r\n  my view, the admission of the written reports was harmless error.Â  The video of\r\n  the forensic interview was shown at trial, as allowed by statute, the victims\r\n  testified, and Appellant testified.Â  The jury heard both sides of the story and\r\n  nonetheless convicted Appellant.Â  Appellant has not shown that the introduction\r\n  of the reports so tainted the verdict that he was prejudiced.Â  As stated\r\n  previously, I disagree with the per se rule created by Jolly and its\r\n  progeny.Â  In my opinion, a defendant should always be required to prove he\r\n  suffered prejudice from the improper introduction of cumulative hearsay\r\n  testimony.Â  \r\n I\r\n  do not believe the forensic interviewer's report vouched for the credibility of\r\n  the victims.Â  The interviewer did not state she believed the victims.Â  In fact,\r\n  she testified that her role as a forensic interviewer was &quot;to interview\r\n  children and to report the information that they share,&quot; and that\r\n  &quot;[i]t's not [her] job to prove guilt or innocence or to prove whether\r\n  someone is telling the truth or not.&quot;Â  Therefore, in my view, the reports\r\n  did not vouch for the victims.Â  \r\n Thus,\r\n  Appellant suffered no prejudice from the introduction of the reports, and I\r\n  would hold their admission to be harmless error.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27045","title":"In the Matter of Richard M.

[1]Â  In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs incurred by ODC and the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct in the investigation and prosecution of this\r\n  matter within thirty (30) days of the imposition of discipline.Â  We accept the Agreement and impose a definite suspension of\r\n  one (1) year, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The\r\n  facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nOn January 14, 2010, ODC\r\n  received a complaint regarding respondent.Â  The following day, ODC mailed a\r\n  copy of the complaint to respondent and requested a response.Â  The request was\r\n  mailed to respondent's address on file with the South Carolina Bar.Â  \r\nOn January 19, 2010, ODC met\r\n  with respondent to informally discuss the complaint.Â  During the meeting,\r\n  respondent provided ODC with a different mailing address.Â  By hand-delivery,\r\n  ODC provided respondent with a copy of the complaint and request for a response.Â  \r\nOn February 2, 2010, ODC\r\n  received a response from respondent.Â  Respondent's letter confirmed that his\r\n  address was the one he provided ODC during the January 19, 2010, meeting.Â  \r\nOn February 12, 2010, ODC\r\n  mailed a letter asking for additional information to respondent.Â  The letter\r\n  was mailed to the address provided by respondent on January 19, 2010, and in\r\n  his February 2, 2010, letter.Â  ODC also informed respondent that his address on\r\n  file with the South Carolina Bar had not been changed.Â  \r\nOn March 5, 2010, ODC mailed\r\n  respondent a reminder asking him to respond to the February 12, 2010, letter.Â \r\n  This letter was mailed to respondent at the address provided during the January\r\n  19, 2010, meeting and in his February 2, 2010, letter.Â  Receiving no response,\r\n  ODC issued a Notice to Appear and Subpoena for documents on March 26, 2010.Â \r\n  These documents were served on respondent by mail on March 29, 2010, and March\r\n  30, 2010.Â  The Notice and Subpoena requested respondent's appearance and\r\n  submission of documents on May 3, 2010.Â  ODC mailed these documents to\r\n  respondent's address on file with the South Carolina Bar and as provided during\r\n  the January 19, 2010, meeting and in respondent's February 2, 2010, letter.Â  \r\nOn May 3, 2010, respondent\r\n  failed to appear to respond to questions under oath and failed to provide the\r\n  subpoenaed documents.Â  As a result of his failure to appear and provide the\r\n  documents, the Court placed respondent on interim suspension on May 5, 2010.[2] Â In the Matter of Campbell, id.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nOn April 17, 2009, respondent\r\n  closed a refinance loan for Complainants.Â  Soon thereafter, respondent's office\r\n  called Complainants and scheduled an appointment for them to sign additional\r\n  documents.Â  Complainants appeared at respondent's office at the scheduled date\r\n  and time. Â Respondent, however, did not appear for the appointment.Â  After\r\n  waiting for more than one hour, Complainants left the office.Â  Complainants\r\ntelephoned respondent on several occasions, but did not receive a response. \r\nOn April 19, 2010, the lender\r\n  contacted Complainants about the note modification agreement.Â  According to the\r\n  lender, South Carolina law required that the Complainants' signatures on the\r\n  note modification agreement be witnessed.Â  The lender included the note modification\r\n  agreement in its correspondence to Complainants.Â  \r\nWhen Complainants reviewed the\r\n  note modification agreement, they realized they had not signed the document.Â  According\r\n  to the document, the note modification agreement supposedly occurred on May 6,\r\n  2009, and was notarized on June 25, 2009, purportedly by respondent's paralegal\r\n  and sister.Â  \r\nImmediately upon receipt of the\r\n  lender's request for a signed and witnessed note modification agreement,\r\n  Complainants executed a note modification agreement with the proper witnesses\r\n  and promptly returned the properly executed agreement to the lender.Â  \r\nRespondent represents he did not\r\n  forge the names of the Complainants on the note modification agreement.Â  He admits,\r\n  however, that it was his responsibility to ensure the document contained\r\n  Complainants' actual signatures.Â  \r\nOn May 17, 2010, ODC mailed a copy\r\n  of the complaint letter and requested a response within fifteen days.Â \r\n  Receiving no response, ODC sent respondent a letter on June 7, 2010, reminding\r\n  him of his obligation to respond and the fact that a failure to respond is a\r\n  ground for discipline pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy,Â  277 S.C 514,\r\n  290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).Â  Respondent received this letter as evidenced by his\r\n  signature on the certified mail card. Â \r\nRespondent did not respond to\r\n  ODC's June 7, 2010, letter.Â  On June 23, 2010, ODC issued a Notice to Appear\r\n  pursuant to Rule 19(c), RLDE, and to provide a statement on the record.Â \r\n  Respondent appeared and provided a statement; however, he did not submit a\r\n  written response to the allegations of misconduct as requested by ODC's earlier\r\n  letters.Â  Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that his misconduct  constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule  7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (it  shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail to appear  personally as directed, willfully fail to comply with a subpoena issued under the  RLDE, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary  authority to include a request for a response or appearance), and Rule 7(a)(5)  (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to  pollute the administration of justice or to bring  the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an  unfitness to practice law).&nbsp; In addition,  respondent admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:&nbsp; Rule  5.3 (lawyer who  possesses managerial authority in law firm shall make reasonable efforts to  ensure that firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that non-lawyer&rsquo;s  conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to  lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional  misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule  8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in  conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).&nbsp; \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose\r\n  a definite suspension of one (1) year, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s\r\n  interim suspension.Â  In addition, within thirty (30) days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission on\r\n  Lawyer Conduct in the investigation and prosecution of this matter.Â  Within\r\n  fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension on May\r\n  5, 2010.Â  In the Matter of Campbell, 387 S.C. 550, 693 S.E.2d 401 (2010).Â  \r\n[2] ODC admits it is unable to prove the\r\n  allegations in the underlying complaint by clear and convincing evidence.Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27046","title":"Carpenter v.

Dickey, 380 S.C. 384, 669 S.E.2d 917 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We find Petitioner\r\n  was entitled to a directed verdict on the issue of self-defense.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  reverse.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn April 2004, Petitioner was\r\n  employed as a security guard at Cornell Arms apartments in Columbia, where he\r\n  also resided.Â  Although not required by his employer for his duties, Petitioner\r\n  carried a loaded pistol, for which he held a valid concealed weapons permit.\r\nOn April 29, 2004, Joshua Boot\r\n  and his friend, Alex Stroud, met Amanda McGarrigle and Tara West while\r\n  tailgating at a Jimmy Buffet concert.Â  After several hours of heavy drinking,\r\n  Boot and Stroud accompanied McGarrigle and West, who were roommates, back to\r\n  their apartment at Cornell Arms.Â  Stroud testified Boot was &quot;pretty\r\n  intoxicated&quot; and had consumed up to twenty beers and several shots of\r\n  tequila throughout the day.Â  As McGarrigle and Boot sat on the couch in her\r\n  apartment, a neighbor threw a water balloon through an open window, splashing\r\n  Boot. Â The water balloon tossing was part of an ongoing joke between\r\n  neighbors.Â  However, the prank so angered Boot that he threatened to physically\r\n  assault the person who splashed him.[1]Â \r\n  Fearful of trouble, McGarrigle asked Boot to leave the apartment, and Boot\r\n  refused.Â  He instead went to find the culprit, in what McGarrigle described as\r\n  an aggressive, angry manner.Â  Boot began banging on neighbors' doors, which\r\n  prompted McGarrigle to go to the security desk, where Petitioner was on duty, and\r\n  ask Petitioner to evict her guest.Â  McGarrigle, Petitioner, and McGarrigle's\r\n  friend, Morteza Safaie, whom she met along the way, searched for Boot on\r\n  several floors and eventually found him back in her apartment.Â  Boot stepped\r\n  outside into the hall and Petitioner identified himself as the security guard\r\n  on duty and asked Boot to leave.Â  According to Safaie and McGarrigle, who were\r\n  standing in the hallway, Boot responded by shouting expletives at Petitioner\r\n  and telling him &quot;he couldn't make him do anything,&quot; then re-entering\r\n  the apartment and slamming the door.Â  Petitioner knocked on the door and again\r\n  asked Boot to leave, without making any threatening comments or gestures or\r\n  raising his voice.Â  Boot again slammed the door in Petitioner's face.Â \r\n  According to Stroud, who, at this point, had come out of West's bedroom, stated\r\n  that Boot was &quot;awfully&quot; angry and Petitioner seemed &quot;pretty\r\n  unhappy.&quot;Â  While standing outside the door to the apartment, Petitioner\r\n  called the Columbia police to report the disturbance, and then asked McGarrigle\r\n  and Safaie to go downstairs to let the officers inside the building.Â  Meanwhile,\r\n  inside the apartment, Stroud attempted to calm Boot and eventually convinced him\r\n  they should leave.Â  West witnessed Boot tuck a liquor bottle in his shorts\r\n  before he exited the apartment.[2]Â  \r\nAs Boot and Stroud walked\r\n  toward the elevator, Petitioner kept his distance and the parties did not\r\n  exchange words. Â However, Stroud testified Boot and Petitioner were\r\n  &quot;staring each other down.&quot;Â  Petitioner chose not to ride with Stroud\r\n  and Boot in the elevator, instead opting to take the stairs.Â  The silence\r\n  continued in the lobby as Petitioner followed several feet behind the men while\r\n  they walked toward the exit.Â  Petitioner testified that he noticed a Crown\r\n  Victoria pass by the lobby windows and thought the police had arrived.Â  He stated\r\n  he followed Boot and Stroud outside so he could inform the police of the\r\n  direction they were walking. Â According to Stroud, Petitioner stood in the\r\n  vicinity of the Cornell Arms doormat watching them silently as they walked\r\n  toward Sumter Street.Â  Kristy Ann Murphy witnessed the scene from a bench\r\n  located in front of the Cornell Arms doorway.Â  She testified that Petitioner\r\n  asked the men to leave in an unthreatening manner, while Boot shouted\r\n  obscenities at Petitioner.Â  Stroud testified that the derogatory comments Boot\r\n  made about Petitioner were directed to Stroud only.Â  After walking halfway down\r\n  the block, Stroud turned around first and asked Petitioner, &quot;[W]hy the\r\n  f--- [are you] following [us].&quot;Â  Stroud testified that Petitioner just\r\n  stood there, making no gestures or comments.Â  Boot and Stroud then turned and\r\n  started walking towards Petitioner quickly.Â  Petitioner testified Boot\r\n  threatened to &quot;whip [his] a--.&quot;Â  Stroud testified he made at most two\r\n  steps, while Boot took two or three big steps, placing Boot nearer to Petitioner\r\n  than Stroud.Â  Stroud testified further that as Boot advanced toward Petitioner,\r\n  he was in the mood to fight and planned to harm Petitioner.Â  Petitioner, in\r\n  turn, testified the two men were covering ground very quickly and if he turned\r\n  his back he was afraid of being attacked from behind with no way to defend\r\n  himself.[3]Â \r\n  When Boot was approximately fifteen feet away, Petitioner pulled a gun from his\r\n  pocket.Â  Petitioner testified he pulled the gun to discourage the two men from\r\n  attacking him.Â  Stroud took a few steps back at the sight of the gun, but Boot\r\n  continued to advance toward Petitioner in an aggressive manner.Â  Petitioner\r\n  testified he saw Boot reach under his shirt as he continued forward, and Petitioner\r\n  feared he was reaching for a weapon.[4]Â \r\n  Without warning, Petitioner fired a shot, striking Boot.Â  After the first shot,\r\n  Boot took another step toward Petitioner.Â  Petitioner's second shot stopped\r\n  Boot.Â  Petitioner then fired a third shot as Boot dropped to his knees.Â  Petitioner\r\n  immediately put the gun back in his pocket and called 911.Â  \r\nThe first officer to arrive\r\n  at the scene heard the three shots.Â  As soon as the officer exited his vehicle,\r\n  Petitioner stated, &quot;I shot him, I am security for the building.Â  I have a\r\n  concealed weapons permit, and the gun is in my right front pants pocket.Â  I\r\n  didn't have a choice.Â  He came at me with a bottle.&quot;Â  Investigators found\r\n  a broken liquor bottle at the scene with a blood smear on the neck of the\r\n  bottle matching Boot's DNA.Â  According to the State's expert witness, smearing\r\n  can occur when someone picks up an object or brushes against something.Â  \r\nSubsequently, a Richland\r\n  County grand jury indicted Petitioner for murder.Â  At the beginning of\r\n  Petitioner's September 2006 trial, his counsel moved for the dismissal of\r\n  Petitioner's murder charge pursuant to the recent enactment of the\r\n  &quot;Protection of Persons and Property Act,&quot; which codified the common\r\n  law Castle Doctrine.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-410 (Supp. 2010).Â  The circuit\r\n  judge denied the motion, finding the Act did not apply to pending criminal\r\n  cases.Â  Petitioner's counsel twice moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on\r\n  the ground that Petitioner was acting in self-defense when he shot Boot.Â  The\r\n  circuit judge denied both motions. \r\nThe circuit judge charged the\r\n  jury on the crimes of murder and voluntary manslaughter, and on the affirmative\r\n  defense of self-defense.Â  Petitioner's counsel objected to the voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge, arguing there was no evidence to support this charge.Â \r\n  Petitioner's counsel additionally challenged that the judge's self-defense\r\n  instructions were inadequate.Â  The circuit judge denied these motions, and the\r\n  jury convicted Petitioner of committing voluntary manslaughter.Â  The circuit\r\n  judge sentenced Petitioner to sixteen years' imprisonment.Â  The court of\r\n  appeals affirmed.Â  Dickey, 380 S.C. at 384, 669 S.E.2d at 917.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the court held the circuit judge: (1) properly denied Petitioner's motion for\r\n  acquittal on the ground of self-defense; (2) sufficiently instructed the jury\r\n  on the law of self-defense; (3) correctly submitted the charge of voluntary\r\n  manslaughter to the jury; (4) adequately instructed the jury regarding the\r\n  charge of voluntary manslaughter; and (5) properly refused to retroactively\r\n  apply the &quot;Protection of Persons and Property Act&quot; to Petitioner's\r\n  case.Â  This Court granted Petitioner's petition for a writ of certiorari.Â \r\n  Petitioner appeals all of the grounds upon which the court of appeals affirmed\r\n  his conviction.Â  Finding Petitioner was entitled to a directed verdict of\r\n  acquittal on the ground of self-defense, we reach that issue only.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (appellate court need not address\r\n  remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court only reviews errors of law and is clearly\r\n  bound by the trial court's factual findings unless the findings are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220\r\n  (2006).\r\nANALYSIS\r\n&quot;A defendant is entitled\r\n  to a directed verdict when the state fails to produce evidence of the offense\r\n  charged.&quot;Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648\r\n  (2006).Â  If there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence\r\n  reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the appellate court must\r\n  find the case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  Id. at 292-93,\r\n  25 S.E.2d at 648.Â  However, when a defendant claims self-defense, the State is\r\n  required to disprove the elements of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Wiggins,\r\n  330 S.C. at 544-45, 500 S.E.2d at 492-93.Â  We find the State did not carry that\r\n  burden.Â  \r\nA person is justified in\r\n  using deadly force in self-defense when:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; The\r\n    defendant was without fault in bringing on the difficulty;\r\n  (2)&nbsp; The defendant . . . actually\r\n    believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious\r\n    bodily injury, or he actually was in such imminent danger;\r\n  (3)&nbsp; If the defense is based upon\r\n    the defendant's actual belief of imminent danger, a reasonable prudent man of\r\n    ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same beliefÂ  . . . ;\r\n    and\r\n  (4)&nbsp; The defendant had no other\r\n    probable means of avoiding the danger of losing his own life or sustaining\r\n    serious bodily injury than to act as he did in this particular instance.\r\n\r\nId. at 330 S.C. at 545, 500 S.E.2d at 493 (citing\r\n  State v. Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 46, 317 S.E.2d 452, 453 (1984)).Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fault in Bringing about the Harm\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes a\r\n  business proprietor's right to eject a trespasser from his premises.Â  State\r\n    v. Brooks, 252 S.C. 504, 510, 167 S.E.2d 307, 310 (1969) (citing\r\n      State v. Rogers, 130 S.C. 426, 126 S.E. 329 (1925)).Â  If the proprietor is\r\n  &quot;engaged in the legitimate exercise in good faith of his right to eject,\r\n  he would in such case be without fault in bringing on the difficulty, and would\r\n  not be bound to retreat.&quot;Â  Id. (citing Rogers, 130 S.C. at\r\n  426, 126 S.E. at 329)).Â  Therefore, to withstand a motion for directed verdict\r\n  as to whether Petitioner, an agent of Cornell Arms, was at fault in bringing\r\n  about the harm, the State had to disprove Petitioner's claim that he was\r\n  ejecting Boot in good faith.Â  Even viewing the facts in a light most favorable\r\n  to the State, the State did not carry this burden.Â  \r\nThe court of appeals stated\r\n  that a jury could have reasonably found Petitioner's decision to exit the\r\n  building &quot;and brandish his loaded gun . . . was an act reasonably\r\n  calculated to provoke a new altercation with Boot . . . .&quot;Â  However, the\r\n  testimony is consistent that Petitioner was not brandishing[5] his gun when they were outside, but rather, he pulled the gun from its holster when\r\n  Boot and Stroud turned and began advancing toward him in an aggressive manner.Â \r\n  The State did not produce any evidence to contradict Petitioner's testimony he\r\n  routinely carried the concealed weapon, and did not deliberately arm himself in\r\n  anticipation of a conflict that evening.Â  The record establishes Petitioner did\r\n  not know Boot prior to his attempt to eject him and only did so in his capacity\r\n  as a security guard, and upon request of a tenant.Â  It is undisputed that Petitioner\r\n  called the police before ejecting Boot and Stroud, and then immediately called\r\n  911 after firing the shots.Â  Petitioner's stated reason for walking outside was\r\n  to inform the police, whom he thought had arrived, of the direction Boot and\r\n  Stroud were walking.Â  The State did not rebut Petitioner's stated reason for\r\n  his exit and, in fact, the only evidence the State offered to prove Petitioner's\r\n  fault in bringing about the harm was the act of following Boot and Stroud\r\n  outside.Â  As Petitioner had the right to eject the trespassers from the\r\n  premises, his decision to exit the building and stand on the doormat to ensure\r\n  their departure cannot, in and of itself, be construed as acting in bad faith.Â \r\n  Had Petitioner accompanied the ejection with threatening words or posture, a\r\n  jury question may have arisen.Â  See State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. at 547,\r\n  500 S.E.2d at 494 (testimony that appellant threatened to &quot;kick both\r\n  [victim's and sister's] a--es&quot; raised a jury question as to whether\r\n  appellant was exercising good faith in ejecting victim).Â  However, under these\r\n  facts, we find Petitioner was exercising his right to eject trespassers in good\r\n  faith and, as a matter of law, he was without fault in bringing about the\r\n  difficulty.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;Subjective and Objective Belief of Imminent Danger\r\nWe\r\n  find that even the testimony most adverse to the defense, Stroud's testimony,\r\n  established as a matter of law that Petitioner actually believed he was in\r\n  imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, and\r\n  that a reasonable person of ordinary firmness would have entertained the same\r\n  belief.Â  &quot;[W]ords accompanied by hostile acts may, depending on the circumstances,\r\n  establish a plea of self-defense.&quot;Â  State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. 440,\r\n  444, 377 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1989) (quoting State v. Harvey, 220 S.C. 506,\r\n  68 S.E.2d 409 (1951)).Â Â  We believe such circumstances were present in this\r\n  case.Â  It is uncontroverted that Boot was highly intoxicated, acted aggressively\r\n  over the course of the conflict, that he began advancing toward Petitioner quickly\r\n  with the purpose of assaulting him, that he continued advancing toward Petitioner\r\n  after Petitioner pulled the gun, and there was great disparity in the physical\r\n  stature and capabilities of Boot and Petitioner.Â  Furthermore, the State did\r\n  not rebut Petitioner's testimony that he saw Boot reach under his shirt as he advanced.Â \r\n  To the contrary, West testified she saw Boot place a bottle in his shorts as he\r\n  left the apartment, and a broken bottle was found on the scene with Boot's\r\n  blood smear on the neck.[6]Â \r\n  Petitioner testified he did not see what Boot was reaching for when he fired\r\n  the shots, but because Boot continued advancing after seeing the gun, Petitioner\r\n  believed he was reaching for a deadly weapon.Â  A person has the right to act on\r\n  appearances, even if the person's belief is ultimately mistaken.Â  State v.\r\n    Fuller, 297 S.C. 440, 443-44, 377 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1989).Â  &quot;Once the right\r\n  to fire in self-defense arises, a defendant is not required to wait until his\r\n  adversary is on equal terms or until he has fired or aimed his weapon in order\r\n  to act.&quot;Â  State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 322, 531 S.E.2d 907, 913\r\n  (2000) (citing State v. Hendrix, 270 S.C. 653, 244 S.E.2d 503\r\n  (1978)).Â  There is uncontroverted testimony that Petitioner acted upon the\r\n  appearance that Boot had a deadly weapon.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  testified that, under the circumstances and appearances, he believed he was in\r\n  actual danger of death or serious bodily harm.Â  We find it reasonable that\r\n  Petitioner made such an assumption and that a person of Petitioner's stature\r\n  and limited agility would entertain the same fear when faced with an attack by\r\n  a belligerent, intoxicated, more agile, and younger male, who appeared to be\r\n  reaching for a weapon.Â  The State certainly did not rebut these elements of\r\n  self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, as the law requires.Â  Therefore, we find\r\n  that as a matter of law, Petitioner actually believed he was in imminent danger\r\n  of losing his life, or sustaining serious bodily injury, and that a reasonable\r\n  person would have entertained the same belief.\r\nC.&nbsp; Duty to Retreat\r\nA defendant is not required\r\n  to retreat if he has &quot;no other probable means of avoiding the danger of\r\n  losing his own life or sustaining serious bodily injury than to act as he did\r\n  in [the] particular instance.&quot;Â  Wiggins, 330 S.C. at 545, 500\r\n  S.E.2d at 493 Â The court of appeals found &quot;the State provided\r\n  evidence that, if believed, tended to show Petitioner had other probable means\r\n  of avoiding the danger than acting as he did.&quot;Â  However, the court never\r\n  specified what evidence it relied on to support that finding.Â  Instead, it\r\n  focused on whether or not Petitioner was absolved of his duty to retreat under\r\n  the Castle Doctrine.Â  We do not think it necessary to determine whether\r\n  curtilage can extend to a public sidewalk, because we find the State failed to\r\n  disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner had no other probable means\r\n  of avoiding the danger.\r\nAs discussed previously, Petitioner\r\n  was not at fault in bringing about the harm by exiting the building.Â  Once\r\n  outside, Petitioner was faced with a situation where two younger, intoxicated,\r\n  and physically superior men were advancing toward him, one with the clear\r\n  intent to assault him and who was undeterred at the sight of Petitioner's gun.Â \r\n  Moreover, the State did not disprove Petitioner's testimony that Boot reached\r\n  for something under his shirt as he continued toward Petitioner.Â  The testimony\r\n  is consistent that Boot moved toward Petitioner at a fast pace.Â  Had Petitioner\r\n  turned his back, he would have likely been attacked from behind as he tried to\r\n  get through the first set of glass doors.Â  Even if he were able to pass through\r\n  the first set of doors unscathed, he would likely have been trapped in the\r\n  breezeway behind the second set of locked doors.Â  Petitioner was classified as\r\n  permanently disabled and testified that he could not run. Â Therefore, the\r\n  uncontroverted facts establish as a matter of law that Petitioner had no other\r\n  probable means of avoiding the danger other than to act as he did.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons set forth above, we find the State failed to disprove the elements\r\n  of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Even viewing the facts in a light\r\n  most favorable to the State, the evidence establishes that Petitioner shot and\r\n  killed Boot in self-defense.Â  Therefore, we reverse the court of appeals and\r\n  overturn Petitioner's conviction.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nKITTREDGE\r\n  and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n  BEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur, but would reverse on the ground the Court\r\n  of Appeals erred in upholding the trial judge's decision to charge voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  Moreover, were I to reach the issues, I would find reversible\r\n  error in the unconstitutional jury charge on the facts, and I would find that\r\n  while the evidence established the first three elements of self-defense as a\r\n  matter of law, there was a jury issue whether petitioner was in the building's\r\n  curtilage such that he had no duty to retreat.Â  See e.g., State\r\n    v. Brooks, 252 S.C. 504, 167 S.E.2d 307 (1969).\r\nIn my opinion, the\r\n  dispositive issue here is that of the voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  Taking\r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, it shows that at the\r\n  request of a tenant, petitioner located the combative, intoxicated victim and\r\n  asked him to leave.Â  Petitioner endured the victim's obscenities, insults, and\r\n  threats of physical violence calmly, and called the local police to report the\r\n  incident.Â  As the man began to leave the building, petitioner chose not to\r\n  enter the elevator with him but instead took the stairway.Â  Petitioner then\r\n  followed the victim and his companion as they exited the building.Â  As one\r\n  would expect from a security guard who had just escorted such an individual off\r\n  the premises, petitioner stood outside the building to make sure the men\r\n  actually left the area.Â  Compare State v. Brooks, supra (right to eject patron from business includes following patron outside).\r\nWhen the victim and his\r\n  friend turned and approached petitioner, petitioner felt &quot;afraid&quot; and\r\n  &quot;outnumbered,&quot; then shot the victim.\r\nIn my view, there is no\r\n  evidence that petitioner was so angry and fearful that he lost control, and was\r\n  rendered incapable of cool reflection.Â  Instead, the evidence reflects that\r\n  petitioner retained his composure despite the threats and language directed at\r\n  him by the victim, and only shot when the victim and his friend turned back and\r\n  approached petitioner outside the building whose occupants he was paid to\r\n  guard.Â  After the shooting, petitioner again called 911, and reported the\r\n  events.Â  I simply see no evidence of fear manifesting itself in an\r\n  uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  In my view, the only evidence is that\r\n  petitioner, admittedly acting out of fear, nonetheless acted in a deliberate,\r\n  controlled manner.Â  As such, he could not, as a matter of law, be guilty of\r\n  voluntary manslaughter.Â  State v. Starnes, 388 S.C. 590, 698 S.E.2d 604\r\n  (2010).\r\nI concur in the decision to\r\n  reverse.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  For reasons that will be discussed, I dissent as I\r\n  would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and, in turn, Dickey's\r\n  conviction for voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\nIn challenging the decision\r\n  of the Court of Appeals, Dickey raises seven issues.Â  In response to the\r\n  divergent views of this Court, I have consolidated the issues under the\r\n  following two headings:Â  (1) self-defense, which, if found as matter of law,\r\n  would be dispositive as to the charge of murder; and (2) voluntary\r\n  manslaughter, a lesser-included offense of murder.Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Self-Defense\r\nA. Motion\r\n  for a Directed Verdict of Acquittal\r\nDickey contends the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in finding the trial judge properly refused to direct a verdict\r\n  of acquittal based on self-defense.Â  In conjunction with his self-defense\r\n  arguments, Dickey claims the Court of Appeals erred in failing to address\r\n  whether a glass bottle should be considered a deadly weapon under South\r\n  Carolina law as Dickey believed Boot was armed with a large glass bottle that\r\n  could have been used to inflict serious bodily harm or death.Â  \r\n&quot;A defendant\r\n  is entitled to a directed verdict when the [S]tate fails to produce evidence of\r\n  the offense charged.&quot;Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625\r\n  S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  the appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648. Â &quot;When reviewing a denial of a directed\r\n  verdict, this Court views the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the [S]tate.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  292, 625 S.E.2d at 648.\r\nOnce raised by\r\n  the defense, the State must disprove self-defense beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d\r\n  298, 303 (2002). Â There are four elements required by law to establish a case\r\n  of self-defense.Â  State v. Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 46,\r\n  317 S.E.2d 452, 453 (1984).Â Â  The four elements are:\r\n\r\n  First, the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the\r\n    difficulty. Â Second, the defendant must have actually believed he was in\r\n    imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he\r\n    actually was in such imminent danger. Â Third, if his defense is based upon his\r\n    belief of imminent danger, a reasonably prudent man of ordinary firmness and\r\n    courage would have entertained the same belief. Â If the defendant actually was\r\n    in imminent danger, the circumstances were such as would warrant a man of\r\n    ordinary prudence, firmness and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to\r\n    save himself from serious bodily harm or losing his own life. Â Fourth, the defendant had\r\n    no other probable means of avoiding the danger of losing his own life or\r\n    sustaining serious bodily injury than to act as he did in this particular\r\n    instance. Â If, however, the defendant was on his own premises he had no duty to\r\n    retreat before acting in self-defense.\r\n\r\nId.; State v. Hendrix, 270 S.C. 653,\r\n  657-58, 244 S.E.2d 503, 505-06 (1978).\r\nUnder the Castle\r\n  Doctrine, &quot;[o]ne attacked, without fault on his part, on his own premises,\r\n  has the right, in establishing his plea of self-defense, to claim immunity from\r\n  the law of retreat, which ordinarily is an essential element of that\r\n  defense.&quot;Â  State v. Gordon, 128 S.C. 422, 425, 122 S.E. 501, 502\r\n  (1924).Â  Our appellate courts have recognized that the rule also applies to a\r\n  person's place of business.Â  Id.; State v. Brooks, 252 S.C. 504,\r\n  167 S.E.2d 307 (1969).Â  The absence of a duty to retreat also extends to the\r\n  curtilage of one's home or place of business.Â  State v. Wiggins, 330\r\n  S.C. 538, 548 n.15, 500 S.E.2d 489, 494 n.15 (1998).Â  Curtilage includes\r\n  outbuildings, the yard around a dwelling, a garden of the dwelling, or the\r\n  parking lot of a business.Â  Id.\r\nApplying the\r\n  foregoing to the facts of the instant case, I find that all four elements of\r\n  self-defense were not established as a matter of law to warrant a directed\r\n  verdict.Â  As to the first element of self-defense, a question of fact was\r\n  created as to whether Dickey was without fault in bringing on the conflict.Â \r\n  The State presented undisputed evidence that Dickey followed Boot and Stroud\r\n  after they left the apartment building.Â  Because Dickey could have remained\r\n  inside behind the safety of the locked doors to wait for the police, there is\r\n  evidence that Dickey could have avoided the fatal confrontation.\r\nÂ I disagree,\r\n  however, with the Court of Appeals' finding that Dickey's actions were\r\n  &quot;reasonably calculated to provoke a new altercation with Boot, and that\r\n  Dickey intended to engage in mutual combat.&quot;Â  Dickey, 380 S.C. at\r\n  394, 669 S.E.2d at 923.Â  \r\nFirst, this\r\n  ground was neither raised to the trial judge nor submitted to the jury.Â \r\n  Secondly, the Court of Appeals appears to have found that mutual combat was\r\n  established as a matter of law, which would have precluded Dickey's reliance on\r\n  self-defense.Â  See State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 232, 589 S.E.2d\r\n  1, 3 (2003) (&quot;Whether or not mutual combat exists is significant because\r\n  the plea of self-defense is not available to one who kills another in mutual\r\n  combat.&quot; (citation omitted)); State v. Graham, 260 S.C. 449, 450,\r\n  196 S.E.2d 495, 495 (1973) (&quot;To constitute mutual combat there must exist\r\n  a mutual intent and willingness to fight and this intent may be manifested by\r\n  the acts and conduct of the parties and the circumstances attending and leading\r\n  up to the combat.&quot; (citation omitted)).Â  In contrast to the Court of\r\n  Appeals, I find there was a question of fact as to the requisite intent for the\r\n  doctrine of mutual combat; thus, mutual combat could have been submitted to the\r\n  jury.Â  Accordingly, I believe the Court of Appeals' reference to this doctrine\r\n  was harmless as it did not negate the court's correct finding regarding the\r\n  first element of self-defense.\r\nIn terms of the\r\n  second and third elements, i.e., Dickey's belief that he was in imminent danger\r\n  of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, the State presented\r\n  evidence to create a question of fact as to the &quot;reasonableness&quot; of\r\n  Dickey's belief that he needed to shoot Boot. \r\nFirst, the\r\n  evidence was disputed as to whether Boot was in possession of a deadly weapon\r\n  and whether he was reaching for one prior to the shooting.Â  Although there is case law to support Dickey's\r\n  assertion that the glass bottle constituted a deadly weapon, I note that this\r\n  issue was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  Thus, it was\r\n  not properly preserved for appellate review.Â  See State v. Moore,\r\n  357 S.C. 458, 464, 593 S.E.2d 608, 612 (2004) (holding\r\n  an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved\r\n  for review). \r\nEven assuming the issue was\r\n  preserved and the Court of Appeals erred in failing to rule on it, it is\r\n  inconsequential whether the bottle constituted a deadly weapon as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  Moreover, the jury was specifically instructed that &quot;a deadly weapon\r\n  is any article, instrument or substance that is likely to cause death or great\r\n  bodily harm.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the State presented evidence that Dickey did\r\n  not consider himself in imminent danger as Dickey readily exited the locked\r\n  building and continued the confrontation outside of the apartment building.\r\nAs to the fourth element, the\r\n  &quot;duty to retreat,&quot; I find the State presented evidence that Dickey\r\n  was not immune as a matter of law under the Castle Doctrine as Dickey was not\r\n  within the curtilage of the apartment building at the time of the shooting. At\r\n  the time of the shooting, Dickey was on the doormat outside the front door of\r\n  Cornell Arms.Â  According to the testimony, the doormat was placed near the\r\n  front of the building on a public sidewalk.Â  As recognized by the Court of\r\n  Appeals, it is a novel issue in this state as to whether a public sidewalk in\r\n  front of an apartment building is considered curtilage.Â  Dickey, 380\r\n  S.C. at 395, 669 S.E.2d at 924.Â Â  In ruling that the public sidewalk did not\r\n  constitute curtilage, the Court of Appeals relied on our state's jurisprudence\r\n  establishing that curtilage does not extend to a public street.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appeals also cited cases from other jurisdictions where appellate courts\r\n  &quot;refused to hold there is no duty to retreat from a sidewalk in front of a\r\n  business or residence.&quot;Â  Id. at 396-97, 669 S.E.2d at 924.\r\nFor several reasons, I agree\r\n  with the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  Initially, I would note that the\r\n  court properly relied on this state's case law discussing curtilage with\r\n  respect to public streets.Â  The underlying theory in these cases is that a defendant\r\n  is not immune from the duty to retreat on property where he did not have the\r\n  right to eject his adversary.Â  A public sidewalk falls within this category as\r\n  it constitutes public land from which a person could not eject another person.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the out-of-state cases cited by the Court of Appeals as well as\r\n  other secondary authority support this proposition.Â  See Jeffrey F.\r\n  Ghent, Annotation, Homicide:Â  Duty to Retreat as Condition of Self-Defense\r\n    When One is Attacked at His Office, or Place of Business or Employment, 41\r\n  A.L.R.3d 584 (1972 &amp; Supp. 2011) (analyzing the doctrine of retreat within\r\n  the general rules of self-defense and discussing state cases where courts have\r\n  considered where a person attacked at his office or place of business is precluded\r\n  from relying on his right to self-defense by a duty of retreat).Â  Moreover,\r\n  regardless of the position of the Cornell Arms doormat,[7] Dickey was on the public sidewalk at the time he shot Boot.Â  Once Dickey left\r\n  the building and walked onto the public sidewalk, he was under a duty to\r\n  retreat as the sidewalk was not part of the curtilage of his residence or\r\n  business.Â  \r\nFurthermore, there is\r\n  undisputed, quantifiable evidence that Dickey could have easily retreated\r\n  without incident.Â  The circumstances just prior to the shooting establish that\r\n  Dickey was aware of the potential threat and had sufficient time to retreat.Â \r\n  Dickey testified that he watched Boot and Stroud walk to the corner of\r\n  Pendleton and Sumter Street before they turned around.Â  At that point,\r\n  according to crime scene investigators, Boot and Stroud would have been\r\n  approximately 68 feet from the Cornell Arms doormat on which Dickey stood.Â \r\n  Dickey testified that as Boot and Stroud came back in his direction they\r\n  continued their profane rant and threatened to &quot;whip [his] a--.&quot;Â \r\n  Once Dickey realized that Boot and Stroud were heading back in his direction in\r\n  a menacing manner, it would have been reasonable for Dickey to retreat.Â  Thus,\r\n  without question, Dickey had a duty to retreat; however, the question is\r\n  whether Dickey could do so safely.Â  This question was one for the jury to\r\n  resolve. \r\nAdditionally, I find\r\n  disingenuous the majority's reliance on Dickey's claimed disability as support\r\n  for its holding regarding self-defense.Â  Although Dickey testified he could not\r\n  run as a result of this disability, there is evidence to the contrary in that\r\n  he was able to descend several flights of stairs to the lobby in the same time\r\n  it took Boot and Stroud to ride the elevator.Â Â  \r\nIn view of the foregoing, I\r\n  agree with the Court of Appeals that Dickey was not entitled to a directed\r\n  verdict based on his claim of self-defense.\r\nB. Â Application of &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; Law\r\nIn conjunction with his\r\n  &quot;duty to retreat&quot; challenges, Dickey argues the Court of Appeals\r\n  erred in finding the trial judge properly refused to retroactively apply the\r\n  &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law to this case.Â  \r\nAlthough Dickey refers to the\r\n  Act as the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, it is identified in the South\r\n  Carolina Code as the &quot;Protection\r\n    of Persons and Property Act.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-410 (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  This Act states, &quot;It is the intent of\r\n  the General Assembly to codify the common law Castle Doctrine which recognizes\r\n  that a person's home is his castle and to extend the doctrine to include an\r\n  occupied vehicle and the person's place of business.&quot;Â  Id. Â§\r\n  16-11-420(A).Â  The Act became effective on June 9, 2006, and contained a\r\n  &quot;Savings Clause,&quot; which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  The repeal or amendment by this act of any law, whether temporary\r\n    or permanent or civil or criminal, does not affect pending actions, rights,\r\n    duties, or liabilities founded thereon, or alter, discharge, release or\r\n    extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under the repealed or\r\n    amended law, unless the repealed or amended provision shall so expressly\r\n    provide. \r\n\r\nAct No. 379, 2006\r\n  S.C. Acts 2909.\r\nBecause this Act\r\n  was promulgated prior to Dickey's September 2006 trial, defense counsel moved\r\n  for the trial judge to dismiss Dickey's case based on the &quot;immunity from\r\n  criminal prosecution&quot; created by the Act.Â  The trial judge denied the\r\n  motion, finding the Act did not apply as Dickey's case had been pending since\r\n  April 2004 and, thus, was precluded from the Act's application.Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals held the trial judge properly refused to apply the Act retroactively.Â \r\n  In so ruling, the court found the Act creates substantive rights for citizens\r\n  and, therefore, the Act would only operate retroactively if there was a clear\r\n  indication from the Legislature that this was intended.Â  Dickey, 380\r\n  S.C. at 404-05, 669 S.E.2d at 928.Â  Referencing the Act's savings clause, the\r\n  court concluded that &quot;the Legislature clearly manifested its intent that\r\n  the Act be applied prospectively.&quot;Â  Id. at 405, 669 S.E.2d at 928.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the court held the Act should not have been applied to Dickey's\r\n  case as the criminal prosecution was pending before the effective date of the\r\n  Act.Â  Id.\r\nI find the Court\r\n  of Appeals properly affirmed the trial judge's decision to preclude the\r\n  application of the Act as the Legislature's intent is clear and unambiguous\r\n  that the Act is to be applied prospectively.Â  See State v. Varner,\r\n  310 S.C. 264, 266, 423 S.E.2d 133, 134 (1992) (recognizing that prospective\r\n  application is presumed absent a specific provision or clear legislative intent\r\n  to the contrary).Â Â Â  In any event, the evidence presented clearly showed that\r\n  Dickey was not in his home, business, or vehicle at the time of the shooting. \r\nC. Sufficiency of Self-Defense Jury Instructions\r\nFinding the trial judge\r\n  properly submitted self-defense to the jury, I now assess the sufficiency of\r\n  the judge's jury instructions.\r\n\r\n(1) &quot;Right to Act on\r\n  Appearances&quot;\r\nIn challenging the\r\n  judge's instructions, Dickey argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding the\r\n  instruction on the right to act on appearances was adequate &quot;where the\r\n  instruction did not explain the proper test, which is especially critical where\r\n  Dickey could see Boot reaching under his shirt.&quot;Â  Additionally, Dickey\r\n  asserts the Court of Appeals &quot;failed to recognize that the right to act on\r\n  appearances is a separate issue from the second and third elements of\r\n  self-defense regarding actual danger and reasonable belief of danger.&quot;\r\nAs an initial matter, I\r\n  believe Dickey is barred from raising certain arguments to this Court as they\r\n  were not presented to the trial judge or the Court of Appeals.Â  See State\r\n    v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 196, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448 (2003) (holding a defendant may not argue one ground at trial and\r\n  another on appeal). \r\nAt trial, Dickey's counsel\r\n  submitted two requests to charge on the right to act on appearances.Â  Although\r\n  the trial judge instructed the jury on the right to act on appearances, he did\r\n  not use the specific language requested by Dickey.[8]Â \r\n  On appeal, Dickey generally argued that the trial judge &quot;erred by refusing\r\n  to adequately charge on appearances.&quot;Â  Accordingly, I confine my review of\r\n  this issue solely to a determination of whether the trial judge's instruction\r\n  on the right to act on appearances adequately covered Dickey's requests to\r\n  charge.\r\nTo warrant\r\n  reversal, a trial judge's refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant. Â Burkhart,\r\n  350 S.C. at 263, 565 S.E.2d at 304.Â  &quot;Failure to give requested jury\r\n  instructions is not prejudicial error where the instructions given afford the\r\n  proper test for determining the issues.&quot; Â Id.Â \r\n  An appellate court will not reverse the trial judge's decision regarding a jury charge absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. 527, 570, 647 S.E.2d 144, 166 (2007). \r\nTurning\r\n  to the facts of the instant case, I agree with the decision of the Court of\r\n  Appeals that the trial judge sufficiently instructed the jury on the right to\r\n  act on appearances as the instruction essentially &quot;tracked&quot; the\r\n  language of this Court's opinion in State v. Jackson, 227 S.C. 271, 278,\r\n  87 S.E.2d 681, 684 (1955).[9]Â \r\n  Notably, Dickey cited Jackson in support of his two requests.Â  Given the\r\n  judge's instruction covered the substance of Dickey's requests, the judge's\r\n  failure to charge the requests did not constitute reversible error.\r\n(2) &quot;Curtilage/Duty to\r\n  Retreat&quot;\r\nDickey asserts the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in finding the trial judge correctly refused to instruct the jury\r\n  on curtilage.Â  In support of this assertion, Dickey claims the Court of Appeals\r\n  erred in holding that &quot;the duty to retreat was adequately charged based\r\n  solely on its conclusion that the public sidewalk was not curtilage.&quot; \r\nAt trial, Dickey's counsel\r\n  requested the following instruction on curtilage:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    absence of a duty to retreat extends to the curtilage of the dwelling or place\r\n    of business.Â  The curtilage is the area of land adjoining a dwelling or\r\n    business, which includes porches, outbuildings, yards, gardens and parking\r\n    lots. \r\n\r\n Although the trial\r\n  judge declined this instruction, he charged the jury on the duty to retreat:\r\n\r\n  I would\r\n    charge you that if a defendant is on his own premises or if a defendant is on\r\n    his own place of business that the defendant had no duty to retreat before acting\r\n    in self-defense. \r\n\r\nAs previously discussed, I\r\n  agree with the Court of Appeals' ruling that Dickey was not within the\r\n  curtilage of the apartment building as he was on a public sidewalk at the time\r\n  of the shooting.Â  Even if curtilage should have been charged, I find Dickey's\r\n  request to charge was an incorrect statement of law.Â  The charge expanded this\r\n  state's definition of curtilage by adding the phrase &quot;the area of land\r\n  adjoining a dwelling or business.&quot;Â  See Wiggins, 330 S.C. at 548 n.15, 500 S.E.2d at 494 n.15 (defining\r\n  curtilage to include outbuildings, the yard around a dwelling, a garden of the\r\n  dwelling, or the parking lot of a business); cf. State v. Brooks,\r\n  79 S.C. 144, 149, 60 S.E. 518, 520 (1908) (stating that &quot;one on his land,\r\n  adjoining a public road, if assaulted by another who is on such road, is bound\r\n  to retreat before taking the life of his adversary if there is probability of\r\n  his being able to escape without losing his life or suffering grievous bodily harm&quot;\r\n  given &quot;he would not have had the right to eject his adversary from the\r\n  place where he had a right to be&quot;).\r\nAccordingly, I believe the\r\n  Court of Appeals correctly found that self-defense was properly submitted to\r\n  the jury and the trial judge sufficiently charged the requisite elements.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Voluntary Manslaughter\r\nIn view of my conclusion that\r\n  Dickey was not entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal based on\r\n  self-defense and the instructions regarding self-defense do not warrant\r\n  reversal, the question becomes whether the trial judge erred in submitting the\r\n  lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter to the jury or committed\r\n  error in the substance of the jury instructions.\r\nA. Â Submission of\r\n  Voluntary Manslaughter to the Jury\r\nDickey asserts the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in &quot;failing to reconcile that fear can constitute heat of\r\n  passion under Wiggins with self-defense as a matter of law under Hendrix.&quot;Â \r\n  In support of this assertion, Dickey claims the fear required for voluntary\r\n  manslaughter &quot;must be considerably greater in degree or kind than the\r\n  rational fear&quot; required for self-defense.Â  Specifically, Dickey believes\r\n  that &quot;it must be an irrational fear that causes a person to lose control\r\n  of himself temporarily.&quot;Â  He further contends the Court of Appeals erred\r\n  in finding there was &quot;ample evidence&quot; of heat of passion to support a\r\n  charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Essentially, Dickey avers the evidence\r\n  supports a finding that &quot;he either shot with malice or in self-defense&quot;;\r\n  therefore, the jury should not have been instructed on voluntary manslaughter. \r\n&quot;Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in\r\n  sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.&quot;Â  Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. at 572, 647 S.E.2d at 167 (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Heat of passion\r\n  alone will not suffice to reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;Both heat of passion and sufficient legal provocation must be present at\r\n  the time of the killing.&quot;Â  Id. &quot;The sudden heat of passion,\r\n  upon sufficient legal provocation, which mitigates a felonious killing to\r\n  manslaughter, while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out knowledge\r\n  and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and\r\n  render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce\r\n  what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable impulse to\r\n  do violence.&quot; Â Id. Â \r\n&quot;To warrant\r\n  the court in eliminating the offense of manslaughter it should very clearly\r\n  appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from\r\n  murder to manslaughter.&quot; Â Id. at 572, 647 S.E.2d at 168 (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;In determining whether the act which caused death was impelled\r\n  by heat of passion or by malice, all the surrounding circumstances and\r\n  conditions are to be taken into consideration, including previous relations and\r\n  conditions connected with the tragedy, as well as those existing at the time of\r\n  the killing.&quot;Â  State v. Norris, 253 S.C. 31, 35, 168 S.E.2d 564,\r\n  566 (1969).\r\nAfter the Court\r\n  of Appeals issued its decision as to Dickey's case, this Court clarified the\r\n  law with respect to whether fear can constitute sudden heat of passion.Â  State\r\n    v. Starnes, 388 S.C. 590, 698 S.E.2d 604 (2010), cert. denied, 131\r\n  S. Ct. 1504 (2011).Â  \r\nIn Starnes,\r\n  the defendant appealed his two murder convictions arguing, in part, that the\r\n  trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury on the law of voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  Id. at 596, 698 S.E.2d at 607-08.Â Â  Starnes claimed he\r\n  was entitled to the charge as he testified that when one of the victims pointed\r\n  a gun at him, he felt threatened and was in fear; thus, the threat of imminent\r\n  deadly assault was sufficient to submit the charge of voluntary manslaughter to\r\n  the jury.Â  Id. at 596, 698 S.E.2d at 608.\r\nAlthough the\r\n  Court found the trial judge properly refused to charge voluntary manslaughter,\r\n  it clarified the law concerning &quot;how a defendant's fear following an\r\n  attack or a threatening act relates to voluntary manslaughter.&quot;Â  Id. at 597, 698 S.E.2d at 608.Â  Â Specifically, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n  We reaffirm the principle that a person's fear immediately\r\n    following an attack or threatening act may cause the person to act in a sudden\r\n    heat of passion. Â However, the mere fact that a person is afraid is not\r\n      sufficient, by itself, to entitle a defendant to a voluntary manslaughter\r\n      charge. Consistent with our law on voluntary manslaughter, in order to\r\n    constitute &quot;sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation,&quot;\r\n    the fear must be the result of sufficient legal provocation and cause\r\n    the defendant to lose control and create an uncontrollable impulse to do\r\n    violence. Succinctly stated, to warrant a voluntary\r\n      manslaughter charge, the defendant's fear must manifest itself in an\r\n      uncontrollable impulse to do violence.\r\n  A person may\r\n    act in a deliberate, controlled manner, notwithstanding the fact that he is\r\n    afraid or in fear. Â Conversely, a person can be acting under an uncontrollable\r\n    impulse to do violence and be incapable of cool reflection as a result of fear.\r\n    The latter situation constitutes sudden heat of passion, but the former does\r\n    not. Evidence that fear caused a person to kill another person in a sudden heat\r\n    of passion will mitigate a homicide from murder to manslaughter-it will not\r\n    justify it. Â This is the distinction between voluntary manslaughter and\r\n    self-defense. Â We reiterate that evidence of self-defense and voluntary\r\n    manslaughter may coexist and that a charge on self-defense and voluntary\r\n    manslaughter may be warranted. \r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  598-99, 698 S.E.2d at 609 (second emphasis added).\r\nApplying Starnes to the facts of the instant case, I find the Court of Appeals correctly\r\n  affirmed the trial judge's decision to submit voluntary manslaughter to the\r\n  jury as a lesser-included offense of murder.Â  Initially, I note that Dickey\r\n  conceded the element of sufficient legal provocation; thus, I confine my\r\n  analysis to the remaining element of heat of passion.Â  \r\nI find the State\r\n  presented evidence from which the jury could have determined that Dickey's fear\r\n  manifested itself in an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  Dickey\r\n  testified that he was &quot;afraid of being hurt or killed.&quot; In addition\r\n  to evidence of Dickey's fear, West and\r\n  McGarrigle claimed that Dickey looked &quot;angry&quot; and appeared\r\n  &quot;irritated&quot; during the encounter outside of the apartment.Â \r\n  Furthermore, over the course of a short time-period, Dickey endured Boot's\r\n  profane verbal attack and threats of violence, thus, rendering Dickey incapable of cool reflection as a result of his anger and fear\r\n  of Boot.Â  In light of this evidence, I disagree with the majority's conclusion\r\n  that Dickey &quot;acted in a deliberate, controlled manner.&quot;Â  It cannot be\r\n  said that there was no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from\r\n  murder to manslaughter.\r\nB. Â Trial Judge's Use of an &quot;Illustration&quot;\r\n  in Charge\r\nIn concluding that the trial\r\n  judge properly submitted the charge of voluntary manslaughter to the jury, the\r\n  analysis turns to the substance of the judge's instruction.\r\nDickey argues the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in finding the trial judge's illustration during the voluntary\r\n  manslaughter portion of his charge was not an improper comment on the facts of\r\n  the case.Â  Specifically, Dickey challenged the following language in the\r\n  judge's charge:\r\n\r\n  By way\r\n    of illustration and I would point out this is by illustration alone, that if an\r\n    unjustifiable assault is made with violence with the circumstances of indignity\r\n    upon a man's person and the party so assaulted kills the aggressor the crime\r\n    will be reduced to manslaughter.Â  \r\n\r\nDickey claims the\r\n  illustration was an unconstitutional[10] comment on the facts of the case given &quot;the undisputed nature of the facts\r\n  and the judge's directive that the exact facts of the case 'will be'\r\n  manslaughter.&quot;\r\nThe Court of Appeals rejected\r\n  Dickey's challenge.Â  In so ruling, the court found the charge, taken as a\r\n  whole, was not erroneous as it was &quot;unlikely that a reasonable juror would\r\n  have singled out the illustration portion of the charge and interpreted it as\r\n  the court's opinion on the facts of this case or as an instruction on the\r\n  weight to be given to the evidence.&quot;Â  Dickey, 380 S.C. at 402-03,\r\n  669 S.E.2d at 927.\r\nFor several reasons, I agree\r\n  with the Court of Appeals' finding that the judge's &quot;illustration&quot;\r\n  did not constitute reversible error. First, the judge was extremely thorough in\r\n  his instructions and emphasized to the jurors that they were the arbiters of\r\n  the facts.Â  Secondly, the judge clearly instructed the jury that his\r\n  instruction was &quot;by illustration alone.&quot;Â  Finally, the judge did not\r\n  impermissibly indicate his opinion as to the weight or sufficiency of the\r\n  evidence, Dickey's guilt, or any fact in controversy.Â  Significantly, the judge\r\n  instructed the jury that he was not permitted to have any opinions regarding\r\n  the facts of the case and that the jury should not construe anything he said\r\n  during trial as an opinion regarding the facts.Â  See State v. Jackson 297 S.C. 523, 526, 377 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1989) (&quot;Under\r\n  South Carolina law, it is a general rule that a trial judge should refrain from\r\n  all comment which tends to indicate to the jury his opinion on the credibility\r\n  of the witnesses, the weight of the evidence, or the guilt of the accused.&quot;).\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Stroud did not witness or hear any commotion concerning the water balloon\r\n  because he was in West's bedroom at the time. \r\n[2] Stroud did not see Boot pick up a bottle, but noticed a fifth of vodka on the\r\n  coffee table earlier in the night.\r\n[3] Boot was six feet, one inch tall and weighed between\r\n  200 and 210 pounds.Â  Petitioner was five feet, eleven inches tall, and weighed\r\n  275 pounds.Â  In 2001, the Veteran's Affairs Administration classified\r\n  Petitioner as thirty percent disabled after he was diagnosed with patella\r\n  syndrome and underwent several corrective operations, leaving his right foot partially\r\n  paralyzed.Â  Due to this disability, Petitioner testified he was unable to run.Â \r\n  Furthermore, two sets of double doors blocked his entry into Cornell Arms.Â  The\r\n  first set of doors open into a breezeway and were not locked.Â  However, the\r\n  second set of doors could only be opened with a key because they locked at 5:00\r\n  p.m. each night for security reasons.Â  At the time of death, Boot had a blood\r\n  alcohol level of .203, over twice the legal limit.Â  \r\n[4] Stroud testified he did not see anything in Boot's hands when he fell.Â \r\n  However, Stroud was behind Boot as Boot advanced.Â  Murphy, who at this point\r\n  was hurrying to the door, fearful of an ensuing fight, stated she may have seen\r\n  Boot reach under his shirt for something, but was unsure.Â  \r\n[5] Brandish is defined as &quot;1. to shake or wave (as a weapon) menacingly 2. to\r\n  exhibit in an ostentatious, shameless, or aggressive manner.&quot; Webster's\r\n    Third New International Dictionary 268 (2002).\r\n[6] Stroud's testimony that he did not notice Boot pick up a bottle when he left\r\n  the apartment and did not see anything in Boot's hand after he fell did not\r\n  affirmatively refute the claims of West and Dickey. \r\n[7]Â \r\n  Dickey has asserted the Cornell Arms mat was flush with the front of the\r\n  building and, therefore, not on the sidewalk.Â  The position of the doormat or\r\n  the overhang is not dispositive on the issue of curtilage.Â  If this argument\r\n  were taken to its logical extreme, curtilage would not be determined by the\r\n  underlying property but rather the position of a business's accoutrements.\r\n[8]Â Â Â \r\n  The trial judge instructed the jury on the right to act on appearances as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  In deciding whether the defendant\r\n    was or believed that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily\r\n    injury you should consider all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the\r\n    offense including the physical condition and the characteristics of the\r\n    defendant and the victim. . . . [I]t does not have to appear that the defendant\r\n    was actually in danger.Â  It is enough if the defendant believed that he was in\r\n    imminent danger and a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and\r\n    courage would [have] had the same belief.Â  A defendant has the right to act on\r\n    appearances even though the defendant's beliefs may have been mistaken.\r\n\r\n[9]Â Â \r\n  In Jackson, this Court held:\r\n\r\n  The test is not whether there was\r\n    testimony of an intended attack but whether or not the appellant believed he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, and he is not\r\n    required to show that such danger actually existed because he had a right to\r\n    act upon such appearances as would cause a reasonable and prudent man of\r\n    ordinary firmness and courage to entertain the same belief.\r\n\r\nJackson, 227 S.C. at 278, 87 S.E.2d at 684.\r\n[10]Â  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 21 (&quot;Judges shall not charge juries in respect\r\n  to matters of fact, but shall declare the law.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
