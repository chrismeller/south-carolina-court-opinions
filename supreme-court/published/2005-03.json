Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25949\r\nHeard May 25, 2004 - Filed March 7, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John Dennis Delgado and Kathrine Haggard Hudgins, both of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, and Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant appeals his convictions for accessory before the fact of armed robbery and accessory before the fact of assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), claiming the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the accessory charges against him and claiming the trial court erred by failing to grant a directed verdict on the accessory charges.Â  We affirm.\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND/FACTS\r\nOn March 31, 2001, Shawn Bobo was shot to death outside his home.Â  His wife, Shanna, was shot four times, but survived her injuries.Â  Appellant was indicted for murder, ABIK, armed robbery, accessory before the fact to murder, accessory before the fact to armed robbery, and accessory before the fact to ABIK.Â  Appellantâ€™s accessory charges related to the robbery and shooting of Shawn.Â  Following a trial, the jury found appellant guilty of accessory before the fact to armed robbery and accessory before the fact to ABIK.Â  He was found not guilty of the remaining charges.Â  Appellant was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment for accessory before the fact to armed robbery and to twenty years, concurrent, for accessory before the fact to ABIK.\r\nThe State presented evidence appellant and several others, including Tommie Smith (Tommie), discussed robbing the victim of cocaine.Â  One of those present, Stanley Moore (known as Rico), testified appellant said he would kill the victim and then pulled out his gun of which Tommie took possession.Â Â Â  Rico testified he, appellant, Tommie, and Michael Osbey (Osbey) all rode in the car to the victimâ€™s house.Â  Rico testified the plan, which appellant had agreed to, was for Osbey to come in and shoot everyone.Â  Appellant and Tommie talked to the victim and went inside the victimâ€™s house.Â  A few minutes later, appellant ran out the front door and motioned Osbey to come inside.Â  Appellant, Tommie, and Osbey later ran to get in the car.Â  Tommie and Osbey had the guns and appellant had a bag of cocaine.\r\nShanna testified she was shot four times by Tommie and Osbey.Â  She stated appellant was not in the kitchen during a struggle for the gun between Tommie and the victim.Â  She further stated she stabbed at appellant behind the recliner in the living room. \r\nIn appellantâ€™s first statement to police, he indicated he was present when Tommie pulled a gun on the victim and when the victim and Tommie began struggling for the gun.Â  Appellant stated he was stabbed by Shanna and that, as he was running out of the front door, he saw Osbey running towards the back door.Â  In his second statement to police, appellant admitted he went to the victimâ€™s house to rob him of cocaine and that the plan was for Tommie to pull out a gun while appellant took the cocaine.Â  After leaving the house, appellant heard shots fired when he was trying to catch up with Rico.Â  He stated that when Osbey and Tommie got in the car, Osbey had the cocaine.Â  They never split up the cocaine.\r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, appellant moved for a directed verdict on the accessory charges because the State had failed to prove appellant was not present when the crimes were committed.[1]Â  The trial court denied the motion because there was conflicting evidence on the presence issue.\r\nDuring appellantâ€™s case, Tommie testified he initiated the plan of robbing the victim and that appellant agreed to the plan and supplied the weapons.Â  The plan was for appellant to pretend he was buying drugs.Â  Appellant was present when Tommie pulled the gun on the victim and told the victim they were going to take the drugs.Â  Tommie and the victim began to struggle for the gun and Shanna stabbed him.Â  Then, Osbey came in and started shooting.Â  Tommie testified appellant left before the shooting started.Â  However, appellant came back inside the house after Osbey had entered and grabbed the cocaine.Â  The three left the house together with over nine ounces of cocaine, worth approximately $9,000.\r\nAppellant testified he agreed with Tommie to purchase cocaine from the victim and later agreed to rob the victim.Â  After they passed the victimâ€™s house, appellant testified he told the others that he did not want to rob the victim.Â  Appellant testified he agreed to buy the drugs as long as Tommie did not try to rob the victim.Â  Tommie assured appellant he would not, but Tommie pulled out a gun as the victim was taking out the cocaine.Â  Tommie and the victim began to struggle and appellant hid behind a couch to stay out of the way of the gun.Â  Shanna ran by him and cut him on his back.Â  Appellant ran out the front door.Â  Osbey was already getting out of the car.Â  Rico was pulling out of the driveway and appellant waved his hand in an attempt to have Rico stop.Â  By the time he got to the edge of the yard, which is near the street, appellant heard a series of shots.Â  He continued down the street and heard more shots.Â  When Osbey later entered the car, he had the cocaine.\r\nAt the close of appellantâ€™s case, appellant renewed his motion for a directed verdict.Â  The motion was denied.Â  The jury found appellant guilty of accessory before the fact of armed robbery and accessory before the fact of ABIK.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I. Did the indictmentsâ€™ failure to allege the element â€œabsence from the scene of the crimeâ€ deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the accessory before the fact charges?\r\n  II. Did the trial court err by failing to direct a verdict for appellant on the charges of accessory before the fact to armed robbery and accessory before the fact to ABIK when no evidence was presented that appellant was absent from the scene of the crime?\r\n  III. Did the trial court err by failing to direct a verdict in appellantâ€™s favor on accessory before the fact to armed robbery when the alleged subject of armed robbery was a quantity of illegal narcotics?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nAppellant argues the accessory before the fact indictments deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction because the indictments did not allege the element â€œabsence from the scene of the crime.â€Â  Before addressing the specific facts of this case, we first address the confusion that has arisen in past jurisprudence between the sufficiency of the indictment and the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court.\r\nRecently, the United States Supreme Court, in United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002), held that a defective indictment does not deprive a court of jurisdiction.[2]Â  The Supreme Court explained that Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1 (1887), was the progenitor of the view that a defective indictment deprived a court of its jurisdiction.Â  Bain, however, is â€œthe product of an era in which [the Supreme Court]â€™s authority to review criminal convictions was greatly circumscribed.Â  At the time it was decided, a defendant could not obtain direct review of his criminal conviction in the Supreme Court.â€Â  Cotton, 535 U.S. at 629-630.Â  As a result, the Supreme Courtâ€™s desire to correct obvious constitutional violations led to a somewhat expansive notion of jurisdiction, which was more a fiction than anything else.Â  Id. at 630.\r\nThe Supreme Court further stated that Bainâ€™s elastic concept of jurisdiction is not what the term jurisdiction means today, i.e. the courtsâ€™ statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.Â  Id.Â  â€œThis latter concept of subject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a courtâ€™s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived.Â  Consequently, defects in subject-matter jurisdiction require correction regardless of whether the error was raised [below].â€Â  Id.\r\nThe Supreme Court stated that its cases after Bain have held that a defective indictment does not affect the jurisdiction of the trial court to determine the case presented by the indictment.Â  The Supreme Court then overruled Bain to the extent it held a defective indictment deprives a court of jurisdiction.\r\nTurning to South Carolina jurisprudence, we note this Court has held that subject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong, Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 526 S.E.2d 222 (2000); and that issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.Â  Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001).Â  The lack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, even by consent of the parties, and should be taken notice of by this Court.Â  Id.Â  However, as was done by the Supreme Court in Bain, this Court broadened the meaning of jurisdiction in State v. Munn, 292 S.C. 497, 357 S.E.2d 461 (1987).Â  Prior to Munn, the rule was that any objection to the sufficiency of the indictment, i.e. that the indictment was defective, had to be made before the jury was sworn.Â  See State v. Young, 243 S.C. 187, 133 S.E.2d 210 (1963)[3] (challenge directed to the sufficiency of the indictment rather than to the jurisdiction of the Court to try the offense charged needed to be raised by a motion to quash before the jury was sworn).Â  This rule was effectively altered by the Munn decision.\r\nIn Munn, citing 41 Am. Jur. 2d Indictments and Informations, Â§ 299 (1968), we stated that defects in the indictment that are of such a fundamental character as to make the indictment wholly invalid are not subject to waiver by a defendant.Â  We concluded that, subject to certain minor exceptions, the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to convict a defendant for an offense when there is no indictment charging him with that offense when the jury was sworn.Â  This language conflated the meaning of subject matter jurisdiction and mixed two separate questions, i.e. whether the trial court has the power to hear a case and whether the indictment is sufficient.[4]\r\nWhile our broadened definition of subject matter jurisdiction occurred more recently than during the time of Bain,[5] we find the Supreme Courtâ€™s comments in Cotton instructive.Â  As noted by the Supreme Court in Cotton and the Missouri Supreme Court in State v. Parkhurst, 845 S.W.2d 31 (Mo. 1992), subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit court and the sufficiency of the indictment are two distinct concepts and the blending of these concepts serves only to confuse the issue.Â  Circuit courts obviously have subject matter jurisdiction to try criminal matters.Â  To end the confusion that was created by Munn, we now conclusively hold that if an indictment is challenged as insufficient or defective, the defendant must raise that issue before the jury is sworn and not afterwards.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (2003) (â€œEvery objection to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof shall be taken by demurrer or on motion to quash such indictment before the jury shall be sworn and not afterwards.â€).Â  However, a defendant may for the first time on appeal raise the issue of the trial courtâ€™s jurisdiction to try the class of case of which the defendant was convicted.[6]\r\nAs stated in State v. Faile, 43 S.C. 52, 59-60, 20 S.E. 798, 801 (1895), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (citations omitted):\r\n\r\n  The indictment is the charge of the state against the defendant, the pleading by which he is informed of the fact, and the nature and scope of the accusation.Â  When that indictment is presented, that accusation made, that pleading filed, the accused has two courses of procedure open to him.Â  He may question the propriety of the accusation, the manner in which it has been presented, the source from which it proceeds, and have these matters promptly and properly determined; or, waiving them, he may put in issue the truth of the accusation, and demand the judgment of his peers on the merits of the charge.Â  If he omits the former, and chooses the latter, he ought not, when defeated on the latter, --when found guilty of the crime charged, --to be permitted to go back to the former, and inquire as to the manner and means by which the charge was presented.\r\n\r\nThe indictment is a notice document.Â  A challenge to the indictment on the ground of insufficiency must be made before the jury is sworn as provided by Â§ 17-19-90.Â  If the objection is timely made, the circuit court should judge the sufficiency of the indictment by determining whether (1) the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon; and (2) whether it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense that is intended to be charged.Â  State v. Wilkes, 353 S.C. 462, 578 S.E.2d 717 (2003); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003) (sufficiency of indictment).Â  In determining whether an indictment meets the sufficiency standard, the court must look at the indictment with a practical eye in view of all the surrounding circumstances.Â  State v. Adams, 277 S.C. 115, 283 S.E.2d 582 (1981).Â  Further, whether the indictment could be more definite or certain is irrelevant.Â  State v. Knuckles, 354 S.C. 626, 583 S.E.2d 51 (2003).Â  \r\nWe note that our holding today, while overruling several cases,[7] is in line with modern jurisprudence.[8]\r\nAddressing the instant case, appellant argues the indictmentsâ€™ failure to allege the element â€œabsence from the scene of the crimeâ€ deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the accessory before the fact charges.Â  Because appellant did not raise the sufficiency of the indictments before the jury was sworn, he cannot now raise this issue on appeal.Â  The issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nII. Absence From Scene of the Crime\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by failing to direct a verdict on the accessory charges when no evidence was presented that he was absent from the scene of the crime.\r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004).Â  In reviewing a motion for directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of the evidence, not with its weight.Â  Id.Â  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Id.\r\nRegarding the accessory before the fact to armed robbery charge, the testimony indicates appellant was present during the time Tommie pulled a gun on the victim and informed the victim they were going to take the cocaine.Â  Rico testified appellant left the victimâ€™s house with the cocaine indicating appellant assisted in completing the armed robbery.Â  Further, appellant, in his first statement to police, did not mention the cocaine and, in his second statement, he stated that he was in the car with Rico when Osbey entered the car with the cocaine.Â  Therefore, there was conflicting evidence whether appellant was present during the taking of the cocaine from the victimâ€™s possession.[9]Â  \r\nRegarding the crime of accessory before the fact to ABIK, Rico testified appellant motioned Osbey to enter the victimâ€™s home pursuant to the plan for Osbey to come in and shoot everyone.Â  Rico also indicated appellant was present during the shooting.Â  However, Tommie and appellant testified appellant was not present during the shooting.\r\nGiven the conflicting evidence on both charges, the trial court appropriately submitted the charges to the jury and properly denied the directed verdict motion.Â  See State v. Curtis, supra (defendant not entitled to directed verdict when State has produced evidence of offense charged; if there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove guilt of accused, Court must find case was properly submitted to jury).\r\nIII. Illegal Drugs as Subject of Armed Robbery\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by failing to direct a verdict in his favor on accessory before the fact to armed robbery where the alleged subject of the armed robbery was a quantity of illegal narcotics.Â  However, illegal drugs may be the subject of an armed robbery.Â  See, e.g., State v. Oliver, 434 S.E.2d 202 (N.C. 1993) (drugs may be subject of armed robbery); Guy v. State, 839 P.2d 578 (Nev. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1009 (1993) (drugs can be subject of robbery).\r\nAppellant also argues the State did not introduce any testimony regarding the value of the narcotics.Â  However, Tommie testified the cocaine taken from the victimâ€™s home had a value of approximately $9,000.Â  Accordingly, the State introduced evidence that something of value had been taken from the victim.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\nWhile perhaps not a complete listing of all the cases affected by this decision, the following cases are overruled to the extent they combine the concept of the sufficiency of an indictment and the concept of subject matter jurisdiction, i.e. a trial courtâ€™s power to hear a charge:\r\nÂ  1.

Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 510 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.\r\nI agree with the majority that the question of the sufficiency of an indictment is not a matter of subject matter jurisdiction, and that in this case the indictments, while flawed, were sufficient to confer jurisdiction.Â  I write separately, however, because in my view the circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to conduct a trial of a criminal charge where there has been no presentment of an indictment by the grand jury.Â  See State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 415 S.E.2d 816 (1992) (valid indictment or waiver of presentment prerequisite for circuit courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction).Â  Further, in my view, the circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty unless there has been a presentment or a written waiver of presentment.Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11; State v. Lazarus, 83 S.C. 215, 65 S.E. 270 (1909); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-23-120 to -150 (1985); compare e.g., State v. Mitchell, 1 Bay (1 S.C.L.) 267 (1792) (S.C. Const. art. 3, Â§2, required serious criminal cases come before the court of general jurisdiction â€œthrough the medium of a grand jury, by indictmentâ€).\r\nIn my view, the majority misapprehends the function of an indictment when it holds that its purpose is merely to serve as notice to the defendant of the charges against him.Â  An indictment serves multiple functions:Â  â€œto enable the accused to repel or rebut the charge, to protect him from a future prosecution for the same charge,[11]and to enable the court to pronounce its judgment.â€Â  State v. Halder, 2 McCord (13 S.C. L.) 377 (1823).Â  While it may be that the first and second reasons for requiring an indictment inure solely to the defendantâ€™s benefit, and therefore may be waived by him, the third requirement is for the benefit of the circuit court, and is not subject to waiver by the defendant. Compare State v. Pollard, 255 S.C. 339, 179 S.E.2d 21 (1971) (defendant may waive constitutional provision intended for his benefit).Â  Further, unlike the other state constitutional provisions which benefit an accused,[12] Article I, Â§ 11 contains a limitation on waiver:Â  The last sentence of this section states â€œThe General Assembly may provide for the waiver of an indictment by the accused.â€Â  Pursuant to this grant of authority, the legislature has enacted statutory waiver provisions.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-23-120 through -150.Â  In my opinion, we must honor the limitation on an accusedâ€™s right to waive the requirements of this constitutional provision.[13]Â  Finally, even if we were to find that a defendant might waive this constitutional requirement, such a waiver would be valid only if made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.Â  I am concerned about the increase in post-conviction filings that would result from our abandonment of the requirement of an indictment or a written waiver of presentment, the resulting appellate proceedings, and the inevitable grants of relief.Â  I believe the limited resources of the judicial branch are better served by requiring compliance on the front end with this clear, unambiguous, and long-standing constitutional prerequisite to a criminal proceeding.[14]Â Â Â  \r\n I also disagree with the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm the denial of appellantâ€™s directed verdict motions on the charges of accessory before the fact.Â  I take a more expansive view of what constitutes presence at the scene than does the majority.Â  Appellant accompanied the codefendants to the scene and entered the home with prior knowledge of their plan to commit a crime.Â  â€œPresence at the scene by prearrangement to aid, encourage, or abet in the perpetration of the crime constitutes guilt as a principal.â€Â  State v. Leonard, 292 S.C. 133, 355 S.E.2d 270 (1987).Â  It is not necessary that the person participate in the actual crime or even observe it in order to be â€œpresent at the sceneâ€ and guilty as a principal.Â  See, e.g., State v. Gates, 269 S.C. 557, 238 S.E.2d 680 (1977) (getaway driver guilty as principal in armed robbery).Â  In my opinion, the evidence here is susceptible only of the inference that appellant was present at the scene aiding, encouraging, and/or abetting the codefendants, and therefore the directed verdicts should have been granted.Â  State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 447 S.E.2d 175 (1993) (absence from scene is element of accessory before the fact).\r\nFor the reasons given above, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n[1]The elements which must concur to justify the conviction of one as an accessory before the fact are as follows:Â  (1) that the defendant advised and agreed, or urged the parties or in some way aided them, to commit the offense; (2) that the defendant was not present when the offense was committed; and (3) that the principal committed the crime.Â  State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 447 S.E.2d 175 (1993) (emphasis added). \r\n[2]Cotton argued that because his federal indictment omitted the threshold levels of drug quantity that enhances the statutory maximum sentence, the trial court was without jurisdiction to impose a sentence for an offense not charged in the indictment.\r\n[3]Cert. denied, 379 U.S. 868 (1964).\r\n[4]See also Mathis v. State, 355 S.C. 87, 584 S.E.2d 366 (2003) (in finding court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict petitioner of first degree burglary, this Court stated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (2003) applies to indictment defects that do not affect the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit court and does not limit a courtâ€™s consideration of indictment defects that affect subject matter jurisdiction, no matter when such issues are raised).\r\n[5]But see State v. Carroll, 30 S.C. 85, 8 S.E. 433 (1889) (implying question of jurisdiction raised where indictment missing element of the offense).\r\n[6]We note that a presentment of an indictment or a waiver of presentment is not needed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the circuit court.Â  However, an indictment is needed to give notice to the defendant of the charge(s) against him.Â  See S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 11 (â€œNo person may be held to answer for any crime the jurisdiction over which is not within the magistrateâ€™s court, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury of the county where the crime has been committed . . .â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-10 (2003) (â€œNo person shall be held to answer in any court for an alleged crime or offense, unless upon indictment by a grand jury . . . .â€).Â  A defendant must object if he is not presented with the indictment or if he has not waived his right to presentment.Â  If the defendant does not object, he is deemed to have waived the right to presentment.Â  See State v. Pollard, 255 S.C. 339, 179 S.E.2d 21Â  (1971) (individual may waive any provision of the Constitution intended for his benefit).\r\n[7]See Appendix. \r\n[8]Few jurisdictions combine the concepts of subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court and the sufficiency of the indictment.Â  See, e.g., Ex parte Cole v. State, 842 So.2d 605 (Ala. 2002) (when first-degree robbery indictment fails to set forth essential element of offense of second-degree robbery, insufficiency of factual basis for guilty plea to second-degree robbery may be attacked on basis court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept the plea); State v. Bullock, 574 S.E.2d 17 (N.C. App. 2002) (when indictment does not allege essential elements of crime charged, trial court does not have subject matter jurisdiction); State v. Presler, 176 N.E.2d 308 (Ohio App. 1960) (court did not have subject matter jurisdiction where indictment did not state element of the offense). \r\n[9]Armed robbery occurs when a person commits robbery, which is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods, or other personal property of any value from the person of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear, while armed with a deadly weapon.Â  Joseph v. State, 351 S.C. 551, 571 S.E.2d 280 (2002).\r\n[10]Abrogated on other grounds by Simpson v. State, 329 S.C. 43, 495 S.E.2d 429 (1998). \r\n[11] A claim of double jeopardy is ordinarily judged by comparing the allegations made in the second indictment with those made in the first.Â  E.g., State v. Shirer, 20 S.C. 392 (1894).\r\n[12] Compare S.C. Const. art. VI, Â§8, permitting governor to suspend certain public officers upon indictment, â€œor upon the waiver of such indictment if permitted by law . . . .â€\r\n[13]It is the right to waive presentment, as provided by statute, that is the personal right of the accused and he may waive only the place of its execution, not the execution itself.Â  State v. Evans, supra.\r\n[14] The Constitutional requirement that no man be tried on serious criminal charges save upon the grand juryâ€™s presentment of a true billed indictment has its roots in the English common law.Â  As this Court acknowledged in 1932:\r\n\r\n  The Grand Jury is of very ancient origin in the history of England . . .it was at the time of the settlement of this country an informing and accusing body only . . . And in the struggles which in those times arose in England between the powers of the King and the rights of the subject, it often stood as a barrier against persecution in his name. \r\n  (italics in original)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Bramlett, 166 S.C. 323, 164 S.E. 873 (1932).\r\nThe Grand Jury exists not merely to investigate and accuse, but acts as a curb on the unbridled power of the sovereign.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of K.

In the Matter of Thornton, 339 S.C. 22, 528 S.E.2d 657 (2000). As a result of his conviction, petitioner was thereafter suspended from the practice of law for ninety (90) days, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.[1] In the Matter of Thornton, 340 S.C. 392, 532 S.E.2d 282 (2000). \r\n In September 2000, petitioner was suspended from the practice of law for six months and one day for failure to pay court reporter fees. In the Matter of Thornton, 342 S.C. 440, 538 S.E.2d 4 (2000). This suspension was retroactive to the date of petitioner&rsquo;s interim suspension in the tax matter. Id. This suspension provided petitioner would not be eligible for reinstatement until completing the terms of any probation and/or incarceration imposed in the tax matter. Id. \r\n In 2002, the Court suspended petitioner from the practice of law for nine (9) months for misconduct which included accepting a loan from a client, failing to properly submit an invoice for attorneys&rsquo; fees with the Social Security Administration, and failing to properly obtain and execute a judgment. In the Matter of Thornton, 349 S.C. 55, 562 S.E.2d 316 (2002). \r\n Petitioner filed this petition to be reinstated to the practice of law pursuant to Rule 33, Rule 413, SCACR. After a hearing, the Committee on Character &amp; Fitness (CCF) filed its Report and Recommendation with the Court. The CCF recommends petitioner be reinstated to the practice of law upon certain conditions. No exceptions were filed. \r\n We accept the CCF&rsquo;s Report and Recommendation and reinstate petitioner to the practice of law subject to the following three conditions: \r\n\r\n   Prior to his reinstatement, petitioner must submit proof of his compliance with continuing legal education requirements, including payment of fees, for 2003 and 2004. See Rule 33(f)(9), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (lawyer who has been suspended for nine months or more must provide evidence of good standing with the CLE Commission equivalent to that of active attorneys during the period of the entire suspension). \r\n  \r\n   Subsequent to his reinstatement, petitioner shall remain under the medical care of Dr. James W. Thrasher, Jr., for a minimum of two (2) years. This care shall include anger management treatment. Petitioner shall follow all recommended treatment. \r\n  \r\n  During the first year of petitioner&rsquo;s reinstatement, Dr. Thrasher must submit quarterly reports to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC). During the second year of petitioner&rsquo;s reinstatement, Dr. Thrasher must submit semi-annual reports to the ODC. Dr. Thrasher&rsquo;s submissions shall report petitioner&rsquo;s treatment and progress. In the event the reports are not filed or petitioner fails to make satisfactory progress with his treatment, ODC shall immediately notify this Court. \r\n\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    s/Jean H.

Westbrook, Post-Conviction Judge\r\nLuke Brown, Trial Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25950\r\nSubmitted February 16, 2005 - Filed March 14, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nDavid I. Bruck and Robert Edward Lominack, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  We granted certiorari to review a post-conviction relief (PCR) order granting respondent a new capital sentencing proceeding, finding his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a â€œplain and ordinaryâ€ meaning jury charge.[1]Â  We find that counselâ€™s performance was deficient, but that there is no evidence of resulting prejudice.Â  We therefore reverse the PCR order.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was convicted of murdering his wife and his son and received two death sentences.Â  His direct appeal was affirmed.Â  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996).Â  At the PCR hearing, trial counsel acknowledged that there was no strategic or tactical reason why he failed to request a â€œplain meaningâ€ charge.Â  The PCR judge granted relief, and the State sought a writ of certiorari to review that decision.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether there is any evidence in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel in the sentencing phase of his capital trial?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA PCR applicant claiming trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance must demonstrate that (1) counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) but for counselâ€™s error, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688 (1984); Sellers v. State, ___ S.C. ___, 607 S.E.2d 82 (2005).Â  In other words, the applicant must establish both error and prejudice.Â  Id.Â  On appellate review, this Court will uphold the PCR judgeâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law if there is any evidence of probative value in the record to support them.Â  Id.\r\nThe PCR judge found that trial counselâ€™s testimony established the error prong of the ineffective assistance test.Â  We agree.Â  He found resulting prejudice from the failure to give â€œthe plain meaningâ€ charge because:\r\n\r\n1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent had no prior criminal record;\r\n2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent had been out on bond prior to the trial and remained out until the guilty verdicts were returned; and\r\n3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the penalty phase evidence was predominately circumstantial, far from overwhelming, and the State had primarily relied on this weak evidence in aggravation during the penalty phase.\r\n\r\nWe disagree.\r\nWe have carefully considered whether the record supports the PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion that respondent was prejudiced by the lack of a plain meaning charge, and conclude it does not.Â  While the factors cited by the PCR judge might support a prejudice finding in some cases, they do not in the context of this case.Â  The evidence, albeit circumstantial, showed that respondent and his wife were experiencing significant marital problems and financial difficulties, and had in fact declared bankruptcy and seen foreclosure proceedings initiated against their marital home.Â  In May 1991, respondent substantially increased life insurance benefits on his wife and child, naming himself as beneficiary.Â  He also forged wifeâ€™s signature on an automobile insurance form in the course of increasing that coverage.Â  On June 19, the bodies of respondentâ€™s wife and son were found in the family car, which had been partially burned.Â  The wife had died of blunt head traumaÂ  consistent with that inflicted by a human fist, and son had been strangled.Â  Respondent had hand injuries consistent with beating, and told others the causes of death prior to receiving autopsy results.\r\nWe do not agree with the PCR judgeâ€™s characterization of the evidence of respondentâ€™s guilt as weak.Â  Further, the evidence demonstrated that respondentâ€™s motives were financial gain and the elimination of his domestic problems.Â  Having achieved what he set out to accomplish, it is not surprising or meaningful that respondent met the obligations of his bond.Â  Further, given the nature of these crimes, we find the fact that he had no prior criminal record irrelevant to the question whether he was prejudiced by the lack of a â€œplain meaningâ€ charge.\r\nThe jury, by its guilty verdicts, found respondent planned in cold blood the deaths of his child and his wife, making arrangements to benefit financially.Â  Further, the â€œplain meaningâ€ charge evolved from the Courtâ€™s concern that capital juries were speculating about parole eligibility.Â  See Southerland v. State, footnote 1, supra.Â Â  There is nothing in this record to indicate that the jurors in respondentâ€™s capital trial were concerned with parole eligibility, or confused about the meaning of a life sentence.Â  We hold there is no evidence in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion that respondent was prejudiced by trial counselâ€™s deficient performance, that is, that had the jury been given a â€œplain meaningâ€ charge there is a reasonable possibility that it would have returned two life sentences.Â  Sellers v. State, supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFinding no evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion that respondent was prejudiced by the lack of a â€œplain meaningâ€ charge, the order granting respondent a new sentencing proceeding is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] It is well settled that a capital defendant is entitled upon request to a jury charge in the sentencing phase of his trial that the term life imprisonment is to be understood in its plain and ordinary meaning.Â  See Southerland v. State, 337 S.C. 610, 524 S.E.2d 833 (1999) (reviewing the history of the â€œplain meaningâ€ charge).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Dane Arlen Bonecutter","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2005-03-11-01","description":"This is an order placing an attorney on interim suspension.","date":"2005-03-14","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of Dane Arlen Bonecutter, Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel has filed a petition asking this Court to place respondent on interim suspension pursuant to Rule 17(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and seeking the appointment of an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nIT IS ORDERED that respondentâ€™s license to practice law in this state is suspended until further order of the Court.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that S.

Howe, III, of Law Offices of Gedney M. Howe, III, P.A., of Charleston; A. Camden Lewis, of Lewis, Babcock &amp; Hawkins, L.L.P.; and Michael E. Spears, of Michael E. Spears, P.A., of Spartanburg, for respondents-plaintiffs.\r\nRichard M. Gergel and W. Allen Nickles, III, of Gergel, Nickles &amp; Solomon, P.A.; Stephen Van Camp, of South Carolina Retirement Systems, Edwin E. Evans, of S.C. Budget and Control Board; and Kent Porth, of Nexsen, Pruet, Jacobs &amp; Pollard, LLP, all of Columbia, for petitioners-defendants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case is before us in our original jurisdiction asking that we construe S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-10(4) (Supp. 2003) which determines how unused annual leave is figured into the calculation of state retirement benefits.Â  \r\nWe recently construed this provision in Kennedy v. South Carolina Retirement System, 345 S.C. 339, 549 S.E.2d 243 (2001).Â  Kennedy involved the computation of â€œaverage final compensationâ€ which is one of the factors used to calculate monthly state retirement benefits.Â  Until 1978, average final compensation was defined under Â§ 9-1-10(17) as:Â  \r\n\r\nthe average annual earnable compensation of a member during the three consecutive fiscal years of his creditable service producing the highest average.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of policy, retiring employees were given credit for unused annual leave in whatever amount had accrued although there was no statutory requirement that such credit be given.\r\nIn 1978, the legislature amended Â§ 9-1-10(17) by adding a specific provision regarding unused annual leave:\r\n\r\nan amount up to and including forty-five days termination pay for unused annual leave may be added to the pay period immediately prior to retirement and included in the average as applicable.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, the legislature amended this provision regarding unused annual leave:\r\n\r\nAn amount up to and including forty-five days termination pay for unused annual leave at retirement may be added to the average final compensation.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs in Kennedy claimed the change in the underscored language meant that the credit for unused annual leave should be added after the average final compensation is calculated, rather than simply factored into the average as previously provided, resulting in an increased benefit.Â  The trial court found against the plaintiffs on August 19, 1997.Â  On May 22, 2000, we issued our opinion reversing.Â  \r\nWe granted rehearing in Kennedy, and on December 5, 2000, extensive oral arguments were heard.Â  On May 22, 2001, we refiled our opinion, this time finding in favor of the Retirement System.Â  We held the legislature could not have intended to bestow a benefit on retirees adding $1.177 billion in liability to the Retirement System without any fiscal impact analysis, floor debate, or the provision of additional funding.Â  We concluded the employeesâ€™ interpretation of the statute would lead to the absurd result of rendering the Retirement System actuarially unsound.Â  Rehearing was denied on July 23, 2001.\r\nMeanwhile, on May 11, 2000, before our original Kennedy opinion was issued, an amendment to the 2000-2001 Appropriations Bill was introduced.Â  The amendment recodified the definitions found in Â§ 9-1-10 and alphabetized them.Â  The definition of average final compensation was renumbered as subsection (4) rather than (17), but otherwise it remained unchanged.Â  This amended provision was ratified as part of the Appropriations Bill in Part II, Â§ 67, Act No. 387, on June 22, 2000, one month after our initial decision in Kennedy.\r\nThe action now before us was commenced on September 24, 2001, two months after we refused to rehear the final Kennedy decision.Â  Plaintiffs filed this case as a class action in Colleton County circuit court.Â  The complaint alleges that the Retirement System has failed to add a credit for unused annual leave up to forty-five days to the average final compensation as required by the 1986 amendment to Â§ 9-1-10(17); further, the failure to pay this additional benefit has resulted in overfunding the Retirement System in breach of the Systemâ€™s fiduciary duty.Â  Plaintiffs claim their position is supported by the legislatureâ€™s ratification of the same definition of average final compensation on June 18, 2000, after our initial Kennedy opinion which construed that definition in favor of the employees.Â  Plaintiffs seek payment of the amounts purportedly withheld illegally since 1986.Â  \r\nOn October 25, 2001, defendants petitioned this Court to take the case in our original jurisdiction which we granted on December 4, 2001.Â  We appointed then Circuit Judge John W. Kittredge as referee.Â  Judge Kittredge filed his report on February 24, 2004, recommending the complaint be dismissed with prejudice.Â  After careful consideration of the briefs and oral argument in this case, we hereby adopt Judge Kittredgeâ€™s recommendations as reported below and enter judgment for defendants.Â  Footnotes indicated by an asterisk are ours.\r\nREFEREEâ€™S ORDER\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe South Carolina Retirement Systems (collectively, the â€œSystemâ€) service several groups of state employees, active and retired.Â  Of the four separate pension funds administered by the South Carolina Budget and Control Board (the Board), this case concerns the two largest funds, consisting of approximately 200,000 active employees and approximately 80,000 former employees in retired status.Â  The South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS) is comprised of state employees, public school teachers and local governmental employees.Â  This action further involves the Police Officer Retirement System (PORS).[1]Â  The SCRS, as of July 2001, had a market value well in excess of $18 billion.\r\nThe System is administered under an elaborate statutory and constitutional scheme designed to protect the independence, integrity and actuarial soundness of the funds.Â  The Board is directed to appoint a plan actuary whose responsibilities include the preparation of annual actuarial valuation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 9-1-230, -240, -260 (1986).Â  The actuarial valuation establishes the foundation for the determination of employer contribution rates and the ongoing monitoring of the actuarial soundness of the various components of the System.Â  The employee contribution rate is set by the General Assembly and the employer rate is set by the Board upon the advice of the plan actuary and the findings and conclusions of the annual actuarial valuation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1020 (Supp. 2003).Â  The actuarial valuation is relied upon in the preparation of the Stateâ€™s annual financial statement and by outside entities in rating the State for purposes of issuance of bonds.\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution, Article X, Â§ 16, grants the Board broad powers to protect the fiscal integrity of the retirement funds.Â  Since 1979, the Board has been empowered to determine that no benefit increase granted by the General Assembly can be implemented until the Board first determines that â€œfunding for such increase on a sound actuarial basis has been provided or is currently provided.â€Â  Section 16 also provides that should the Board determine that any retirement system is not funded on a sound actuarial basis, the General Assembly must provide funding necessary to restore the fiscal integrity of the System.Â  This constitutional provision further protects the accounts of the System from being used for any purpose other than the payment of retirement benefits.Â  In this manner, the fiscal integrity of the System is entrusted to the Board, which relies upon its plan actuary to value, on an annual basis, its ability to provide benefits.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-230 (1986).\r\nIn this action, Plaintiffs seek to re-open and modify official valuations prepared by the plan actuary and relied upon by the Board and General Assembly.Â  Since 1986, the General Assembly has enacted substantial enhancements to retirement benefits, relying upon the official valuations prepared in keeping with the authority delegated to the Board and the plan actuary by statutes and by the Stateâ€™s Constitution.Â  While the granting of relief to Plaintiffs may have unsettling implications in terms of the Stateâ€™s financial condition and the present ability of the system to absorb more debt, Plaintiffs have correctly challenged the Systemâ€™s â€œscare tacticsâ€ at every turn.Â  The success of Plaintiffsâ€™ claim depends solely on the matter of legislative intent.\r\nThe dispositive issue here, as it was in Kennedy v. South Carolina Retirement System, 345 S.C. 339, 549 S.E.2d 243 (2001), is determining the legislative intent in the General Assemblyâ€™s 1986 amendment to the calculation of â€œaverage final compensation,â€ currently codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-10(4) (Supp. 2003).\r\nThe South Carolina General Assembly amended the definition of â€œaverage final compensationâ€ in 1986 to allow members of the Retirement System to retire throughout the year, rather than require essentially all retirements to occur on June 30, the last day of the fiscal year.Â  As expressly stated in the title of the bill that gave rise to this amendment, its purpose was to â€œchange the definition of average final compensation from average earnable compensation of a member during three consecutive fiscal years to twelve consecutive quarters.â€Â  1986 S.C. Act No. 540.Â  No mention was made in the title of the bill of an intent to increase or alter retirement benefits or the benefit formula in any manner.Â  Further, there was no legislative debate or record suggesting that the amendment was in any way associated with a benefit or formula change, and no fiscal impact statement was prepared or provided, which would have been required if there were to be any increase in retirement benefits and costs.\r\nAlthough inartfully drawn, a member at retirement was allowed to add up to forty-five days of unused annual leave to his or her final pay period, which may or may not have been included in the three highest consecutive fiscal years of salary for purposes of computing the â€œaverage final compensation.â€\r\nPrior to 1986, â€œaverage final compensationâ€ was defined as follows:\r\n\r\n(17) â€œAverage final compensationâ€ with respect to those members retiring on or after July 1, 1970, shall mean the average annual earnable compensation of a member during the three consecutive fiscal years of his creditable service producing the highest such average; an amount up to and including forty-five days termination pay for unused annual leave may be added to the pay period immediately prior to retirement and included in the average as applicable.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, the amendment read as follows:\r\n\r\n(17) â€œAverage final compensationâ€ with respect to those members retiring on or after July 1, 1986, shall mean the average annual earnable compensation of a member during the twelve consecutive quarters of his creditable service on which regular contributions as a member were made to the System producing the highest such average; a quarter means a period January through March, April through June, July though September, or October through December.Â  An amount up to and including forty-five daysâ€™ termination pay for unused annual leave at retirement may be added to the average final compensation.\r\n\r\nUpon adoption of the amendment, the System interpreted the statute to allow retirement at the end of any quarter and computed the â€œaverage final compensationâ€ to be the twelve highest consecutive quarters of salary.Â  Up to forty-five days of unused annual leave could be added as â€œtermination payâ€ and included in the computation of â€œaverage final compensationâ€ regardless of which twelve quarters of compensation were used.Â  For nine years this consistent administrative interpretation went unquestioned by thousands of state employees as they qualified for retirement.\r\nThe Kennedy suit was commenced in 1995.Â  As noted, the Supreme Court rejected the employeesâ€™ position and held that the â€œGeneral Assembly intended the forty-five days of unused annual leave to be added to the computation [of average final compensation] before taking the average of the 12 highest quarters.â€Â  Kennedy, 345 S.C. at 348, 549 S.E.2d at 247 (emphasis in original).Â  Plaintiffs here seek to avoid the holding in Kennedy by arguing that the proposed benefit is â€œaffordable.â€\r\nRECOMMENDATION\r\nHaving carefully considered the record, I am firmly convinced that the General Assemblyâ€™s intent in 1986 in amending the definition of â€œaverage final compensationâ€ is precisely as determined in Kennedy.Â  I recommend the Court reject Plaintiffsâ€™ position pursuant to the doctrine of stare decisis.Â  Should the Court desire to revisit the merits of the claim in Kennedy, I recommend dismissal of the complaint for two primary reasons:Â  (1) the matter of legislative intent is not a moving target; and (2) the issue of affordability is largely irrelevant to a determination of legislative intent.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Stare Decisis\r\nThe Court should honor the Kennedy precedent and dismiss Plaintiffsâ€™ action, which seeks to relitigate the identical issue, pursuant to the doctrine of stare decisis.Â  The doctrine of stare decisis enjoys particular efficacy in the context of challenges concerning the construction of statutes and determination of legislative intent.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  As noted by the Court:\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly in the public interest that the law remain permanently settled.Â  Especially is this so in the construction of statutes, for if any change in the statutory law is desired, the General Assembly may readily accomplish it.\r\n\r\nPowers v. Powers, 239 S.C. 423, 427, 123 S.E.2d 646, 647 (1962).\r\nIn the event the Court elects to address the merits of Plaintiffsâ€™ claim, I offer the following analysis.\r\nII.Â  Legislative Intent\r\nThe determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.Â  City of Myrtle Beach v. Juel P. Corp., 344 S.C. 43, 543 S.E.2d 538 (2001); Charleston County Parks and Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 459 S.E.2d 841 (1995).Â  Legislative intent, once determined, is â€œpermanently settledâ€ absent subsequent action by the General Assembly to effect a change in the statutory law.Â  Powers, 239 S.C. at 427, 123 S.E.2d at 647.Â  Either Kennedy is good law or it is not.Â  Plaintiffs certainly cannot be heard to argue that the General Assembly in 1986 intended one result for the Kennedy plaintiffs and another result in this action.Â  As Kennedy goes, so go these Plaintiffs.Â  In my firm judgment, the record before me serves only to reaffirm the holding in Kennedy.Â  I find the evidence concerning legislative history clearly preponderates contrary to Plaintiffsâ€™ position.Â  In so finding, I rely heavily on the sound reasoning of the Kennedy court.\r\nâ€œThe most powerful indication of legislative intent is the lack of legislative history and debate which accompaniedâ€ the change in the definition of â€œaverage final compensation.â€Â  Kennedy, 345 S.C. at 348, 549 S.E.2d at 247.Â  As the Court further stated:\r\n\r\nThe history in no way indicates the legislature intended to make such a dramatic increase in benefits.Â  First, the title of the 1986 Appropriations Act, which included the amendment . . . did not reference an increase in benefits.Â  [footnote omitted].Â  See Ex Parte Georgetown County Water &amp; Sewer Dist., 284 S.C. 466, 468-69, 327 S.E.2d 654, 656 (1985) (â€œThe purpose of Article III, Â§ 17 is to prevent the General Assembly from being misled into the passage of bills containing provisions not indicated in their titles.â€) . . . .Â Â Â  The plain language of the title gives no indication or notice that the amendment would triple the dollar value for unused annual leave.\r\nSecondly, had the General Assembly intended to increase benefits and spend $1.177 billion, it is reasonable to assume they would have engaged in floor debate.Â  They did not.Â  [footnote omitted].Â  Furthermore, no fiscal impact analysis was undertaken.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-7-72 (Supp.1999) (Bills and resolutions requiring expenditure of funds shall have impact statements).Â  [footnote omitted].Â  Finally, the legislature did not determine whether the increase would impact the actuarial soundness of the State Retirement System as a whole.Â  While we hold the amendment to section 9-1-10(17) does not violate S.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 16, the fact that the legislature has never funded the increase as required by article X, Â§ 16 is further evidence the legislature did not intend to bestow such an increase when it amended [the definition].\r\n\r\nKennedy, 345 S.C. at 349, 549 S.E.2d at 248.\r\nAn additional factor weighing against Plaintiffsâ€™ position is that application of such interpretation â€œwould allow members to retire with benefits calculated on an â€˜averageâ€™ salary which is greater than any salary they earned during employment.â€Â  Id.Â  Another consequence would be the exclusion of most public school teachers (who generally do not acquire unused annual leave) from the proposed benefit.Â  It is difficult to imagine that the legislature would intend such a dramatic benefit increase and purposefully exclude teachers from the increased benefit.Â  Certainly, those representing teachers would not sit idly by while all other employee groups were bestowed with an unprecedented and unrequested retirement benefit increase.[2]\r\nIn 1986, the cost of the proposed benefit increase would have been $350 million dollars.Â  It borders on frivolity to suggest that the General Assembly intended to spend $350 million dollars on an unprecedented and unrequested benefit without any meaningful discussion.Â  There was neither floor debate nor controversy nor rancor nor funding, for the simple reason the General Assembly never intended the so-called Kennedy benefit.Â  Moreover, the post-Kennedy legislative inaction lends further support to this conclusion.Â  See Wigfall v. Tideland Utilities, Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 580 S.E.2d 100 (2003) (recognizing the presumption that the legislature is aware of court interpretation of statutes, and construing legislative inaction as evidence of the legislatureâ€™s concurrence with the courtâ€™s interpretation); State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000) (noting the presumption that the legislature is aware of court interpretation of statutes).\r\nPlaintiffs assert the General Assembly â€œadoptedâ€ the initial Kennedy opinion issued by the Supreme Court on May 22, 2000.Â  Plaintiffsâ€™ argument overlooks the fact that the initial Kennedy decision was never final.Â  It is the General Assemblyâ€™s inaction following the entry of the final judgment in Kennedy which is entitled to consideration.*\r\nIt is on the issue of funding where Plaintiffs seek to revisit Kennedy Â through the back door.Â  Indeed, the Kennedy plaintiffs sought rehearing on the contention that the General Assembly in 1986 provided the funding mechanism for the proposed increase in retirement benefits by the elimination of the longevity pay program.Â  The rehearing petition was denied.Â  Kennedy v. South Carolina Retirement System, 349 S.C. 531, 564 S.E.2d 322 (2001).Â  The next line of attack on Kennedy is an independent action to set aside the judgment alleging fraud on the court.Â  For purposes of the present claim, this leads to the focus of Plaintiffsâ€™ case, the issue of affordability.3\r\nIII.Â  Affordability\r\nPlaintiffsâ€™ â€œaffordabilityâ€ argument has expanded well beyond the idea that the funding for the claimed retirement benefit was contemplated in the elimination of the longevity benefit in 1986.Â  The transparent weakness of the position that the new benefit was â€œswappedâ€ for the elimination of the prior benefit, I believe, has forced Plaintiffs to scurry for cover in other areas.Â  In this regard, Plaintiffs seek to scrutinize many of the actions and decisions of the plan actuaries, the Board and others since 1986, and in some instances even prior to 1986.Â  While I do find the proposed benefit was affordable in 1986, Plaintiffsâ€™ claims of affordability are otherwise manifestly without merit.4\r\nThe assertion that the 1986 proposed benefit tripling the value of unused annual leave was a â€œswapâ€ for the 1986 elimination of the longevity benefit can be dealt with in short order.Â  As noted, the cost of the proposed benefit in 1986 was $350 million; today, the figure is far in excess of $1 billion.Â  The savings to the System as a result of the elimination of the longevity benefit was de minimus.Â  For example, in an experience study from 1980 to 1985, of the 4,416 state employees who retired, only 132 (or 2.86%) qualified for the longevity benefit.Â  Plaintiffs do not dispute these figures but simply argue that a five-year study is not a sufficiently â€œmature experience.â€Â  Assuming the accuracy of these figures, even Plaintiffsâ€™ retained actuary, Mr. James Berberian, concedes the modest savings (the so-called â€œactuarial gainâ€) from eliminating longevity pay would have a â€œsmaller impactâ€ and be insufficient to pay the staggering costs associated with the tripling of the value of unused annual leave.5Â  There is absolutely no nexus between the discontinuance of the longevity pay program and the change in definition of â€œaverage final compensation,â€ other than that both items appear in the 1986 Appropriations Act consisting of more than 950 pages.*\r\nThe fact remains the benefit was affordable in 1986, and the System offers only token resistance to this indisputable fact.6Â  Quite frankly, I view the affordability of the proposed benefit in 1986 as much ado about nothing.Â  The System couldÂ  â€œaffordâ€ many things in 1986 that it most probably could not today.7Â  The critical inquiry is the intent of the General Assembly in 1986 in amending the definition of â€œaverage final compensation.â€Â  To bootstrap an affirmative finding of legislative intent on the mere affordability of the proposed benefit in 1986 would require the court to ignore the factors typically considered in determining legislative intent, as discussed above, which uniformly lead to the conclusion that the General Assembly in 1986 did not intend the proposed benefit.*\r\nExcept for Plaintiffsâ€™ argument concerning 1986, their affordability claim is otherwise premised on challenges to the methodologies and assumptions utilized by the responsible parties, including the plan actuaries and the Board.Â Â  While Plaintiffsâ€™ broad brush attack implicates virtually every facet of the System, only three areas warrant discussion:Â  the determination of (1) the â€œnormal cost contribution;â€ (2) the methodologies to ensure that payment of a future benefit (unfunded actuarial accrued liability, or â€œUAALâ€) is accomplished within the thirty-year liquidation period; and (3) an appropriate â€œloadâ€ factor.Â  These issues, to be sure, are not mutually exclusive, for there exists critical interplay between each of these areas.\r\nPlaintiffs in general argue that the System, through its actuaries and the Board, has intentionally miscalculated its assets and liabilities to create the illusion that the purported benefit is not affordable.Â  More specifically, Plaintiffs assert that the System has improperly and artificially increased the Stateâ€™s contribution to â€œnormal cost,â€ which has the effect of reducing funds available for the employer portion attributable to UAAL to fund future payments.Â  There is no credible evidence to support these arguments.Â  To the contrary, the credible evidence compellingly demonstrates that the professionals charged with managing the System have discharged their duties responsibly and with a commitment to ensure the continued stability and soundness of the Stateâ€™s various pension funds.\r\nRetirement benefits are funded by contributions from the employee and employer.Â  â€œNormal costâ€ represents that portion of the employerâ€™s contribution, as determined by the Board, necessary to pay the anticipated benefits of active members.Â  For example, in 2001 the contribution levels [were] (i) employee contributions of 6.0% and (ii) employer contributions of 7.55% for State employees and teachers, and 6.7% for other employers.Â  The employer contribution rates are the sum of 4.61% normal cost contribution and a 2.94% (state employees and teachers) or 2.09% (other employees) contribution intended to amortize the unfunded liability.Â  (Defendantsâ€™ Ex. 15).Â  In properly administering the Systemâ€™s multi-billion dollar pension funds, such critical decisions should be influenced by neither unqualified experts8 nor creative lawyering.Â  Plaintiffs suggest that a minor change in the â€œnormal cost contributionâ€ from 4.61% to 4% (with a corresponding increase in the UAAL contribution for funding of future benefits) would make the Kennedy benefit affordable.Â  Under Plaintiffsâ€™ approach, any proposed benefit can appear affordable on paper, provided one is not too concerned with the integrity and overall soundness of the System.Â  The reality is that ostensibly slight changes to the contribution levels can dramatically affect the Systemâ€™s soundness, especially in ensuring that future benefits are paid within the thirty-year liquidation period.\r\nThe unfunded accrued liability liquidation period serves as another area where Plaintiffsâ€™ proposals would push the system to the edge, and perhaps beyond.Â  In fact, I am persuaded that Plaintiffsâ€™ proposals (to make the Kennedy benefit affordable) would defeat the Systemâ€™s ability to comply with the thirty-year liquidation period.Â  Plaintiffs claim that the retirement plans are â€œoverfundedâ€ as a result of â€œexcessive contributions,â€ leading to a â€œsurplus.â€Â  This argument cannot withstand scrutiny.Â  Plaintiffsâ€™ actuaries concede the SCRS and the PORS had unfunded actuarial liabilities according to the 2001 Actuarial Valuations that exceeded $2.6 billion.Â  The premise of Plaintiffsâ€™ argument is that they have the right to reduce the Boardâ€™s determination of â€œnormal costâ€ and thereby shorten the liquidation period.Â  A liquidation period of less than thirty years is viewed by Plaintiffs as a â€œsurplus.â€Â  Reducing the â€œnormal cost contributionâ€ has the effect of increasing the ability of the System to absorb additional debt.Â  For example, if the liquidation period is twenty years, then the System, according to Plaintiffs, has a surplus of ten years in which to create more debt.Â  â€œOverfundingâ€ in this context merely describes a system retiring debt sooner than actuarially anticipated.Â  Reducing the â€œnormal cost contributionâ€ has this very effect.\r\nPlaintiffs would be content to reduce the â€œnormal cost,â€ increase debt, and run the liquidation period to (and likely beyond) thirty years, while the System has opted for a more cautious approach.Â  The Systemâ€™s approach allows for a measure of flexibility in the event of lean financial times where the return on investments is less than anticipated.Â  I see absolutely no reason to find fault with the Systemâ€™s philosophy and approach, especially since the System began investing in equity markets.Â  Manipulating the â€œnormal cost contributionâ€ and UAAL portions of the employer contributions to achieve Plaintiffsâ€™ desired result would wreak havoc on the System.9\r\nIt is perhaps significant to note that the benefits supposedly purposefully enacted by the General Assembly in 1986 has no peer in the annals of United States public pension plans.Â  In this regard, even Plaintiffsâ€™ experts acknowledge that the proposed benefit has never been contemplated by any public retirement system.Â  The testimony of one of Plaintiffsâ€™ experts, Mr. Fred Bass, is particularly instructive.Â  Bass was not a credible witness.Â  His willingness to manipulate data to promote Plaintiffsâ€™ cause did not go unnoticed.Â  Bass, however, had some limits in his propensity to advocate for Plaintiffs.Â  Forced to admit that he had never seen a pension plan where unused annual leave is added after average final compensation is computed, Bass described the benefit proposed by Plantiffs as â€œextraordinary.â€\r\nAnother illustration of Plaintiffsâ€™ fast and loose approach to actuarial methodologies concerns their desire to alter the Systemâ€™s â€œloadâ€ factor.Â  Plaintiffs contend the System has already accounted for the proposed benefit through pre-funding a â€œloadâ€ of 3.5%, which they assert would have been â€œmore than enoughâ€ to cover the liability of tripling the value of unused annual leave.Â  A â€œloadâ€ is a factor calculated to project the cost of a benefit.Â  In this instance, the record indicates that prior to 1995, a 1% factor was included as a projected cost of all leave in the retirement benefit formula.Â  During the Kennedy litigation, a study was performed by the plan actuary, using a cross section of participants, to calculate an amount attributable to unused annual leave, based upon historical use.Â  This study indicated that including up to forty-five days in the average final compensation formula increased costs to the retirements systems by approximately 2.5% per year.Â  Thereafter, the 2.5% â€œloadâ€ was substituted for the earlier 1% â€œload.â€Â  The plan actuaries have never used a composite 3.5% â€œloadâ€ as argued by Plaintiffs.Â  Having never utilized the proposed 3.5% â€œload,â€ it would be highly inappropriate to retroactively modify methodologies and assumptions utilized in official valuation reports that have been relied upon by the State and others.\r\nIn rejecting the various claims of affordability, it is not my intent to disparage Plaintiffs or their excellent counsel, for it is readily apparent they embarked on the affordability abyss not entirely of their own choosing.Â  Plaintiffs perceive the Kennedy decision as revenue driven, resulting from the potential impact of recognizing the proposed benefit in the context of the present status of the System.Â  I do not read Kennedy as embracing post-1986 affordability as the benchmark for determining legislative intent.Â  In my view, Kennedy properly relied on the facts and circumstances surrounding the 1986 amendment to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly at that time.Â  The concerns with the current financial impact of the proposed benefit on the System are, at best, an adjunct to bolster the underlying determination of legislative intent.\r\nIV.Â  Class Certification\r\nIn light of my proposed findings and recommendations, I need not address the issue of class certification.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter exhaustively reviewing this voluminous record, I come to the conclusion that the courts should be reticent to intervene in the management of the South Carolina Retirement System.Â  Absent evidence of a gross abuse of discretion, the management and administration of the South Carolina Retirement System must remain with those upon whom the law imposes the responsibility.Â  To permit present and former state employees to cherrypick preferred methodologies and financial projections to advance a particular agenda would irreparably undermine the ability of those responsible to discharge their critical duties and compromise the Stateâ€™s credibility among financial institutions and rating agencies.Â  The wisdom of protecting and maintaining constitutional independence concerning the South Carolina Retirement System is beyond serious challenge.10Â  \r\nIn sum, in light of Kennedy, the application of the doctrine of stare decisis would require dismissal of this action.Â  In any event, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that the General Assembly in 1986 intended to triple the value of unused annual leave in amending the definition of â€œaverage final compensation.â€Â  The credible evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates, just as determined by this court in Kennedy, that the forty-five days of unused annual leave should be added to the computation of â€œaverage final compensationâ€ before taking the average of the twelve highest quarters.Â  I recommend Plaintiffsâ€™ complaint be dismissed with prejudice.\r\n JUDGMENT FOR DEFENDANTS.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Alexander S. Macaulay, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The remaining two pension funds, unrelated to this case, are the Legislative Retirement System and the Judicial Retirement System.\r\n[2] Plaintiffs assert that the proposed benefit was indeed requested by Purvis Collins, former director of the System.Â  I disagree.Â  First, the absence of direct evidence has forced Plaintiffs to resort to speculation.Â  I give little weight to such self-serving conjecture.Â  Second, just as Plaintiffs cry foul over the Systemâ€™s reliance on the current director, Peggy Boykin, to establish more recent legislative intent, Plaintiffs are similarly foreclosed from relying on Collinsâ€™s alleged motives.Â  See Kennedy, 345 S.C. at 353, 549 S.E.2d at 250 (rejecting the employeesâ€™ reliance on the testimony of Purvis Collins to establish legislative intent and recognizing the â€œsettled principle in the interpretation of statutes that even where there is some ambiguity or some uncertainty in the language used, resort cannot be had to the opinions of legislators or of others concerned in the enactment of the law, for the purpose of ascertaining the intent of the legislatureâ€).Â  Nevertheless, the Kennedy court deemed Collinsâ€™s testimony as head of the System relevant, insofar as the executive branch interpreted and administered the 1986 amendment.Â  Id.Â  This agency interpretation inures to the benefit of the Systemâ€™s position concerning legislative intent.\r\n* Further, as we noted above, the legislatureâ€™s re-enactment of the definitions in Â§ 9-1-10 was introduced on May 11, 2000, which was before our initial decision in Kennedy while the appeal of the trial courtâ€™s decision in favor of the Retirement System was still pending.Â  This legislative action could therefore indicate an intent to confirm the trial courtâ€™s reading of the statute in favor of Retirement System and not the employees.\r\n3 Plaintiffsâ€™ moving-target approach to legislative intent is further reflected in their attempt to merge the issue of legislative intent with that of affordability by drawing this courtâ€™s attention to the year 2000.Â  Plaintiffs assert that the â€œSystem could easily absorb more than $2 billion in new benefits in 2000.â€Â  I recommend the court reject these efforts, for the sole matter before this court is discerning the General Assemblyâ€™s intent in 1986 in amending the definition of â€œaverage final compensation.â€Â  Plaintiffs are not alone in selectively choosing certain years, for the System is willing to debate the issue of affordability in every year except 1986.\r\n4 I address the matter of affordability for two reasons.Â  First, the parties, particularly Plaintiffs, have devoted considerable attention to the issue.Â  Second, I wish to provide the Court with a meaningful response to all issues deemed important by the parties.Â  By doing so, the Court can make its own determinations of relevancy.Â  I recommend the Court determine the matter of legislative intent on a basis other than affordability.Â  Affordability in years other than 1986 clearly has no bearing on the intent of the General Assembly in 1986.Â  Legislative inaction, however, since the final judgment in Kennedy is some evidence of the General Assemblyâ€™s concurrence with the Courtâ€™s decision.\r\n5 I reject as meritless the testimony of Plaintiffsâ€™ expert who opined that the System saved $150 million from the elimination of the longevity benefit.\r\n* In a similar vein, Plaintiffs rely on a memo written to Rick Kelly, Executive Director of the State Retirement Systems, from Bob Toomey, Chief Administrator of the Budget and Control Board, discussing the impact of our initial decision in Kennedy.Â  The memo recommends asking the legislative conference committee to strike a proposal guaranteeing an annual COLA increase of 1% in order to accommodate the increased benefit for unused annual leave under Kennedy.Â  Plaintiffs argue the fact that the proposed 1% guaranteed COLA was not included in the 2000 Appropriations Act demonstrates legislative intent that â€œaverage final compensationâ€ be interpreted as initially construed by the Court in Kennedy.Â  Plaintiffsâ€™ theory is simply too speculative to support a finding of legislative intent.Â  There is nothing linking an intended increase in benefits and the General Assemblyâ€™s ultimate failure to include the proposed COLA guarantee which could have been dropped for any number of reasons.\r\n6 It appears that the unfounded accrued liability of the System was at that time slightly in excess of $200 million, with a projected amortization period of only four years, well within the thirty-year liquidation period.Â  The System was well situated in the mid to late 1980â€™s to handle new and increased retirement benefits, which were in fact added in the 1980â€™s and 1990â€™s.Â  The increase in retirement benefits, and corresponding increase in the liabilities to the System, has taken many forms, including the recognition in some years of liability associated with cost of living adjustments and otherwise.Â  In later years, more substantial benefits were added, such as the Teacher Employee Retention Incentive Program (TERI/28 ) in 2000.\r\n7 The term â€œaffordâ€ simply reflects the Systemâ€™s then existing ability to absorb additional debt without pushing the amortization period to the brink of the thirty-year mark.Â  Moreover, had the proposed benefit been recognized and funded in 1986, we would now be looking at a vastly different history in terms of retirement benefits and increases through the years.Â  It is this inability to rewrite history that partly explains Plaintiffsâ€™ desire to alter previous yearsâ€™ contribution rates and actuarial methodologies to create an appearance of current affordability.Â  As noted at the end of this section, the affordability focus may also be traced to Plaintiffsâ€™ perceptions of the underpinnings of the Kennedy decision.Â  The simple and correct answer to this quandary is that the General Assembly in 1986 did not intend to triple the value of unused annual leave.\r\n*A footnote in our Kennedy decision specifically states:Â  â€œAlthough we find $1.177 billion to be the correct figure, even a quarter of that figure, as suggested by the dissent, would cause dire consequences to the Retirement System.â€Â  Kennedy, 345 S.C. at 352, 549 S.E.2d at 249, n. 15.Â  The fact remains that in 1986 there was no fiscal impact statement, no floor debate, no funding of an increased benefit, and no indication in the title of the 1986 Appropriations Act that such an increase was intended.Â  Our reliance in Kennedy on evidence that the increased liability would render the Retirement System actuarially unsound was only one factor in determining legislative intent. \r\n8 Plaintiffsâ€™ experts were qualified in the sense their testimony was admissible.Â  I use the term â€œunqualifiedâ€ only to register the lack of credence I assign to their testimony.\r\n9 The thirty-year liquidation period is a mandatory policy of the Board, not merely an aspirational goal.Â  The soundness of the System depends on continued compliance with the thirty-year liquidation period.Â  The System, through the Board, has been vigilant through the years to stay within the thirty-year liquidation period.Â  One example of these efforts is the accounting for a liability over a five-year period, known as â€œsmoothing.â€Â  This accounting adjustment began in approximately 1995 when the System was preparing to transition from book value to market related value.Â  â€œSmoothing,â€ which is a recognized approach, allows a retirement benefit/debt to be reflected pro rata over a five-year period, thereby avoiding significant fluctuations in a given year.Â  Plaintiffsâ€™ effort to assign nefarious motives to the â€œsmoothingâ€ method simply finds no traction in this record.\r\n10 I do not suggest for a moment that the System, and those individuals charged with the fiduciary duty of managing the System, are beyond the reach of the courts.Â  Upon a proper showing, courts will provide appropriate relief.Â  Where, as here, there is an insufficient showing, the court should recognize, and defer to, the broad range of reasonableness inherent in determining acceptable actuarial applications and methodologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t

McKenzie and Gary H. Johnson, II, both of McDonald, McKenzie, Rubin, Miller &amp; Lybrand, of Columbia, for plaintiff.\r\nKenneth R. Raynor, of Templeton &amp; Raynor, of Charlotte, for defendant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Pursuant to Rule 228, SCACR, we accepted the following questions on certification from the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina:Â  \r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Is the relationship between a utility holding a construction permit from the South Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) and a subcontractor hired by the utilityâ€™s independent contractor a â€œspecial relationship,â€ allowing for a claim of equitable indemnity by the utility against the subcontractor?\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the utility have a nondelegable duty that makes it vicariously liable for the subcontractorâ€™s negligence?Â  \r\n\r\nWe answer both questions in the negative.Â Â Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nRock Hill Telephone Company (utility) received a permit from the DOT to install an underground cable along a highway.Â  The utility hired an independent contractor to complete the work.Â  In turn, the independent contractor subcontracted a portion of the work to Globe Communications (subcontractor).Â Â Â  \r\nOne evening, a car struck the subcontractorâ€™s backhoe.Â  The driver of the car was severely injured, and she sued the utility and the subcontractor.[1]Â  The utility cross-claimed against the subcontractor on a theory of equitable indemnification.Â  After discovery and mediation, the utility settled with the driver for $300,000 and dismissed its indemnity action against the subcontractor without prejudice.Â  The subcontractor eventually settled with the driver for $1,500,000.Â  \r\nThe utility then sued the subcontractorâ€”the action currently pending in federal courtâ€”based on a theory of equitable indemnification, seeking to recover the $300,000 paid to the driver in settlement.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Special Relationship\r\nThe utility argues that it has a â€œspecial relationshipâ€ with the subcontractor supporting a claim for equitable indemnification.Â  We disagree.\r\nThere are two forms of indemnity: contractual indemnity and indemnity implied in law, or â€œequitable indemnity.â€Â  James C. Gray, Jr. and Lisa D. Catt, The Law of Indemnity in South Carolina, 41 S.C. L. Rev. 603, 604 (1990).Â  Contractual indemnity involves a transfer of risk for consideration, and the contract itself establishes the relationship between the parties.Â  Id.Â  Equitable indemnity, on the other hand, â€œis based upon the specific relation of the indemnitee to the indemnitor in dealing with a third party.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn general, indemnity may be defined as a â€œform of compensation in which a first party is liable to pay a second party for a loss or damage the second party incurs to a third party.â€ First Gen. Servs. of Charleston, Inc. v. Miller, 314 S.C. 439, 442, 445 S.E.2d 446, 449 (1994) (quoting Town of Winnsboro v. Wiedemen-Singleton, Inc., 303 S.C. 52, 398 S.E.2d 500 (Ct. App. 1990), affâ€™d, 307 S.C. 128, 414 S.E.2d 118 (1992)).Â  The right to indemnity arises by operation of law â€œin cases of imputed fault or where some special relationship exists between the first and second parties.â€Â  Id.Â \r\nIn other words, \r\n\r\na right of indemnity exists whenever the relation between the parties is such that either in law or in equity there is an obligation on one party to indemnify the other, as where one person is exposed to liability by the wrongful act of another in which he does not join.[2]\r\n\r\nStuck v. Pioneer Logging Mach., Inc., 279 S.C. 22, 24, 301 S.E.2d 552, 553 (1983) (citations omitted).Â  We have held that the relationship between a contractor and a subcontractor supports a claim for equitable indemnification. First Gen. Servs., 314 S.C. at 442, 445 S.E.2d at 448; Town of Winnsboro, 307 S.C. at 131, 414 S.E.2d at 120.Â  \r\nIn the present case, however, the relationship between the utility and the subcontractor is an attenuated one.Â  The utility hired an independent contractor to install an underground communications line.Â  The contractor, in turn, hired a subcontractor to perform part of the work.Â  Given these facts, we find that the subcontractor is merely a remote or distant independent contractor, and therefore does not have a special relationship with the utility as contemplated under our jurisprudence.[3]Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the answer to the first certified question is no. \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicarious Liability\r\nThe utility argues, in the alternative, that it has a nondelegable duty that makes it vicariously liable for the subcontractorâ€™s negligence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe general rule is that an employer is not vicariously liable for the negligent acts of an independent contractor.Â  Duane v. Presley Constr. Co., Inc., 270 S.C. 682, 683, 244 S.E.2d 509, 510 (1978).Â  An exception to the general rule is that â€œ[a] person who delegates to an independent contractor an absolute duty owed to another person remains liable for the negligence of the independent contractor just as if the independent contractor were an employee.â€Â  Durkin v. Hansen, 313 S.C. 343, 347, 437 S.E.2d 550, 552-53 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing 57 C.J.S. Master and Servant, Â§ 591 (1948)).Â  This Court has recently described the exceptionâ€”the nondelegable duty doctrineâ€”and its legal consequences, in the following way:\r\n\r\n[a] person may delegate a duty to an independent contractor, but if the independent contractor breaches that duty by acting negligently or improperly, the delegating person remains liable for that breach.Â  It actually is the liability, not the duty, that is not delegable.Â  The party which owes the nondelegable duty is vicariously liable for negligent acts of the independent contractor.\r\n\r\nSimmons v. Tuomey Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32, 42, 533 S.E.2d 312, 317 (2000).\r\nMoreover, this Court has identified several situations in which the nondelegable duty doctrine applies:\r\n\r\nAn employer has a nondelegable duty to employees to provide a reasonably safe work place and suitable tools, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by unsafe activities or tools under the employerâ€™s control.\r\nA landlord who undertakes repair of his property by use of a contractor has a nondelegable duty to see that the repair is done properly.\r\nA common carrier has a nondelegable duty to ensure that cargo is properly loaded and secured, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by an unsecured load.\r\nA bail bondsman has a nondelegable duty to supervise the work of his employees, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by those employees.\r\nA municipality has a nondelegable duty to provide safe streets even when maintenance is undertaken by the state Highway Department, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by defective repairs.\r\n\r\nOsborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 12, 550 S.E.2d 319, 323-24 (2001); see also Simmons, 341 S.C. at 50, 533 S.E.2d at 323 (holding that a hospital owes a nondelegable duty to render competent service to its emergency room patients).\r\nIn the present case, the utility contends that it had a nondelegable duty to perform the work in a safe manner.[4] Â Â This duty, the utility argues, stems from the language in the DOT permit and South Carolina statutory and regulatory law.[5]Â  The DOT permit provides, in relevant part, that the utility agrees â€œto assume any and all liability [the DOT] might otherwise have in connection with accidents or injuries to persons â€¦ [and] agrees to indemnify [the DOT] for any liability incurred.â€Â  In addition, statutory law provides that telephone companies may lay telephone lines if â€œsuch line is constructed so as not to endanger the safety of persons or interfere with the use of such highways or public roads.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-2020 (1976).Â  Finally, regulatory law provides that â€œ[e]ach utility shall exercise reasonable care to reduce the hazards to which its employees, its customers and the general public may be subjected.â€ 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 103-671 (1976) (emphasis added).\r\nWe hold that the provisions cited by the utility do not impose a nondelegable duty.Â  First, the terms in the permit are enforceable only as between the DOT and the utility, not the utility and a remote independent contractor.Â  Second, the statute and the regulation impose a duty of reasonable care, not an absolute, nondelegable duty.Â  \r\nTherefore, because we find that the utility did not owe a nondelegable duty, the answer to the second certified question is no.\r\nConclusion\r\nBecause we find that (1) the relationship between the utility and a subcontractor hired by the utilityâ€™s independent contractor is not a â€œspecial relationship,â€ and that (2) the utility does not have a nondelegable duty making it vicariously liable for the subcontractorâ€™s negligence, we answer both certified questions in the negative.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, JJ., and acting Justice Mark H. Westbrook, concur. PLEICONES, J, dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I write separately because I believe that Rock Hill is entitled to seek equitable indemnification from Globe, the negligent entity.Â  As explained below, I reach this conclusion by examining the facts presented to us.\r\nThe holder of a public franchise is subject to special liability rules, similar to those imposed upon common carriers.Â  The Restatement (2nd) of Torts Â§ 428 states the rule this way:\r\n\r\nAn individual or corporation carrying on an activity which can lawfully be carried on only under a franchise granted by a public authority and which involves an unreasonable risk of harm to others, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to others by the negligence of a contractor employed to do work in carrying on the activity.\r\n\r\nThe comments to this section make clear that the utility is liable to a person injured by the negligence of an independent contractor carrying on the exclusive business of that utility which involves an unreasonable risk of harm, but is not liable for the contractorâ€™s negligence in performing ordinary construction.Â  The critical question here, then, is whether Globe was doing unreasonably dangerous work that only the holder of a franchise could perform when Ms. Smith was injured.\r\nThe facts certified to us are that Ms. Smith was injured when she struck a tractor/backhoe belonging to Globe.Â  At the time of the accident, Globe was installing underground communications lines along a state highway pursuant to a permit issued to Rock Hill.Â  It is well established that the construction of transmission lines is an integral part of a utilityâ€™s business.Â  See e.g., Snyder v. Southern Calif. Edison Co., 44 Cal. 2d 793, 285 P.2d 912 (1955); compare, e.g. Reith v. General Tele. Co. of Illinois, 22 Ill. App. 3d 337, 317 N.E.2d 369 ( Ill. App. 5th Dist. 1974) (defendant utility has nondelegable duty to take safety precautions around excavation site constructed pursuant to franchise and state permit).Â  It is the utilityâ€™s nondelegable duty to insure that transmission lines are safely and properly installed, and it matters not whether the source of this duty is said to be the franchise agreement, statutes, or the common law.Â  Snyder, supra.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe next question is whether equity will require the negligent party, Globe, to indemnify Rock Hill.Â  \r\n\r\n[A] right to indemnity exists whenever the relationship between theÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  parties is such that either in law or equity there is an obligation on one party to indemnify the other, as where one person is exposed to liability by the wrongful act of another in which he does not join.\r\n\r\nStuck v. Pioneer Logging Mach. Inc., 279 S.C. 22, 24, 301 S.E.2d 552, 553 (1983) (emphasis supplied).\r\nUnlike the majority, I find the attenuated relationship between Rock Hill and Globe weighs in favor of equitable indemnification rather than against it.Â  Rock Hill employed an independent contractor, which in turn chose the negligent subcontractor.Â  The majority acknowledges that the independent contractor here would be entitled to indemnity, but denies that relief to Rock Hill, which had absolutely nothing to do with the selection of Globe.Â  \r\nIn my opinion, since Rock Hill did not join in Globeâ€™s negligent act, but is liable as the result of its franchise and its DOT permit, I would find Rock Hill entitled to equitable indemnity.\r\n\r\n[1] It is unclear as to why the driver did not also sue the independent contractor hired by the utility.\r\n[2] In general, there is no right to indemnity between joint tortfeasors.Â  Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Whetstone, 243 S.C. 61, 70, 132 S.E.2d 172, 176 (1963).Â  In the underlying case, both Rock Hill and Globe settled with the driver before liability could be determined.Â  Because there is no evidence in the record that Rock Hill was adjudged to be without fault, we are unwilling to recognize a right of indemnity on this basis as well.Â  See Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 63, 518 S.E.2d 301, 307 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding that the most important requirement for the finding of equitable indemnity is that the party seeking to be indemnified is adjudged without fault and the indemnifying party is the one at fault).Â  \r\n[3] Unlike the dissent, we find that there must be some kind of relationship between the parties beyond the relationship established by virtue of one party alleging that he was sued because of another partyâ€™s wrongdoing.Â  See, e.g, First Gen. Serv., 314 S.C. at 443, 445 S.E.2d at 448 (holding relationship between contractor and subcontractor supports a claim of equitable indemnification); Stuck, 279 S.C. at 24, 301 S.E.2d at 553 (holding purchaser of defective vehicle was entitled to indemnification from seller); Addy v. Bolton, 257 S.C. 28, 33, 183 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1971) (holding landlord entitled to indemnification from general contractor for damage caused to tenantâ€™s property).Â  Â Â \r\n[4] Although this argument seems counterintuitive, it is necessary for the utility to establish that it would have initially been liable for the subcontractorâ€™s negligence.Â  See First Gen. Servs., 314 S.C. at 442, 445 S.E.2d at 449 (the right to indemnity arises by operation of law â€œin cases of imputed fault or where some special relationship exists between the first and second partiesâ€).\r\n[5] We respectfully find the dissentâ€™s analysis of this issue rests on facts that are not part of the record.Â  Therefore, we analyze this issue based solely on the language in the DOT permit and the statutory law identified by Rock Hill as the source of its alleged nondelegable duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25953","title":"Epstein v.

Welch in February, 1996.Â  Welch died three days later of complications.[1]Â  Welchâ€™s estate brought wrongful death and survival actions against Dr. Epstein alleging medical malpractice.Â  Respondent, David Brown, a licensed South Carolina attorney, represented Epstein.Â  On February 18, 1998, a jury returned a verdict of $3,000,000 in the wrongful death action, and $28,535.88 in the survival action.Â  The following day, the jury assessed $3,000,000 punitive damages against Dr. Epstein.Â  \r\nBrown filed a notice of appeal on behalf of Dr. Epstein.Â  Although Brown remained counsel of record during the appeal, Dr. Epstein was represented on appeal by Stephen Groves, John Hamilton Smith, and Steven Brown.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the verdicts on July 31, 2000.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  This Court denied certiorari in January 2001.Â  \r\nDr. Epstein filed this legal malpractice claim against Brown on January 9, 2002, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and breach of contract.Â  Brown moved for summary judgment on the ground that Dr. Epstein had failed to commence the action within the applicable three-year statute of limitations (SOL).Â  The trial court ruled the SOL began to run, at the latest, on February 18, 1998, the date of the juryâ€™s verdict, such that this action was untimely.Â  Accordingly, Brown was granted summary judgment.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same standard as the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP:Â  â€œsummary judgment is proper when â€˜there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . .Â  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€™â€Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438-439 (2003), citing Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, the evidence and its reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id. at 115, 410 S.E.2d at 545.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err in ruling Dr. Epstein knew, or should have known, he had a possible claim against Brown by the date of the juryâ€™s adverse verdict, such that the SOL began to run on that date?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2003) provides a three year statute of limitations for legal malpractice lawsuits.Â  Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the injured party either knows or should know, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action exists for the wrongful conduct.Â  See Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645 (1996); S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535.Â  See also Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 492 S.E.2d 794 (Ct.App.1997).Â  The exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that an injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.Â  The statute of limitations begins to run from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory of recovery developed.Â  Id.Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  Under Â§ 15-3-535, the statute of limitations is triggered not merely by knowledge of an injury but by knowledge of facts, diligently acquired, sufficient to put an injured person on notice of the existence of a cause of action against another.Â  True v. Monteith, 327 S.C.Â  116, 120, 489 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1997).Â  \r\nIn his complaint, Dr. Epstein alleged Brown was negligent in numerous particulars, including: failing to conduct an adequate investigation, failing to advise Epstein to settle, failing to keep Epstein adequately informed during the pendency of the case, representing multiple defendants with conflicts of interest, forgetting to call expert witnesses, and adopting a defense which was contrary to Dr. Epsteinâ€™s medical opinion.Â  Counsel for Dr. Epstein conceded that many of these allegations were within Dr. Epsteinâ€™s knowledge at the time of the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  The court found the majority of the damages alleged by Dr. Epstein stemmed from the adverse jury verdict, and the damages to his reputation resulting from the publicity were all damages suffered at the time of the verdict.Â  The court concluded that, although these damages might be mitigated by a successful appeal, they could never be wholly eliminated by a reversal of the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Accordingly, the trial court ruled Dr. Epstein either knew, or should have known, of a possible claim against Brown by the date of the adverse verdict, such that the SOL began to run on that date.Â  \r\nDr. Epstein contends that because Brown remained counsel of record during the pendency of the appeal,[2] the SOL did not begin to run until this Court denied certiorari, in January 2001.Â  Dr. Epstein urges us to adopt the â€œcontinuous representationâ€ rule to toll the SOL during the period an attorney continues to represent a client on the same matter which forms the basis of a legal malpractice action.Â  We decline to adopt the continuous representation rule in the context of a legal malpractice claim and adhere, instead, to the discovery rule set forth by the Legislature.Â  \r\nUnder the continuous representation rule, the SOL is tolled during the period an attorney continues to represent the client on the same matter out of which the alleged malpractice arose.Â  See George L. Blum, Attorney Malpracticeâ€”Tolling or Other Exceptions to Running of Statute of Limitations, 87 ALR 5th 473, Â§ 4 (2001).Â  In those jurisdictions where it is adopted, the rule requires: 1) ongoing representation by the lawyer; 2) on the same subject matter; and 3) continuous representation.Â  See generally, Mallen and Smith, Legal Malpractice, Â§ 22.13, p. 431 (5th Ed. 2000).\r\nThis Court has not specifically addressed the continuous representation rule.Â  However, in Holy Loch Distributors v. Hitchcock, 332 S.C. 247, 503 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1998), revâ€™d on other grounds, 340 S.C. 20, 531 S.E.2d 282 (2000), the Court of Appeals specifically declined to adopt the continuous representation rule, based in large part on this Courtâ€™s refusal to adopt the â€œcontinuous treatmentâ€ rule in the context of medical malpractice cases.Â  See Preer v. Mims, 323 S.C. 516, 519, 476 S.E.2d 472, 473 (1996).Â  \r\nIn Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 580 S.E.2d 109 (2003), this Court declined to adopt the continuous treatment rule.Â  In Harrison, the plaintiff was a schizophrenic who had been involuntarily committed in 1982.Â  He remained there until 1995, and ultimately brought suit against the defendant, the state hospital, alleging he had been confined too long and had been improperly medicated.Â  He argued his causes of action should be deemed to have accrued on the date of his discharge in 1995.Â  We defined the continuous treatment rule as follows:\r\n\r\nThe so-called continuous treatment rule as generally formulated is that if the treatment by the doctor is a continuing course and the patient's illness, injury or condition is of such a nature as to impose on the doctor a duty of continuing treatment and care, the statute does not commence running until treatment by the doctor for the particular disease or condition involved has terminated--unless during treatment the patient learns or should learn of negligence, in which case the statute runs from the time of discovery, actual or constructive.\r\n\r\n354 S.C. at 135, 580 S.E.2d at 112, quoting David W. Louisell &amp; Harold Williams, Medical Malpractice, Â§ 13.02[3] (1996).\r\nIn Harrison, we recognized the policy behind adoption of the continuous treatment rule being that, without such a rule, a plaintiff would be required to bring suit against his or her physician before treatment is even terminated.Â  354 S.C. at 136, 580 S.E.2d at 113.Â  Alternative reasons justifying the rule are â€œa patientâ€™s right to place trust and confidence in his physician,â€ the difficulty of determining the precise timing of an act of malpractice during continuous treatment, and â€œbasic tort principles of fairness and deterrence.â€Â  Id. at 136-137, 580 S.E.2d at 113.Â  Notwithstanding the very legitimate policy rationales in favor of adoption of a continuous treatment rule, we declined to adopt it, finding the Legislature has set absolute time restrictions for the bringing of medical malpractice actions in the statutes of repose both for medical malpractice and for persons operating under disability. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-3-545 and 15-3-40.Â  Id.\r\nWe find the justifications favoring adoption of the continuous treatment rule are similar to those justifying the continuous representation rule, to wit: to avoid disruption of the attorney-client relationship; to allow an attorney to continue efforts to remedy a bad result, even if some damages have occurred and the client is aware of the attorneyâ€™s errors.Â  See generally, Mallen and Smith, Legal Malpractice, Â§ 22.13 (5th Ed. 2000).Â  See also United States National Bank of Oregon v. Davies, 548 P.2d 966, 970 (Or. 1976)(it seems anomalous to force a plaintiff to contend in the underlying litigation on appeal that he is entitled to a favorable decision, while in a simultaneous legal malpractice action he is forced to contend his attorney's negligence was why he received an unfavorable judgment at the trial level).\r\nNotwithstanding such justifications, numerous jurisdictions refuse to judicially adopt the continuous representation rule.Â  See Beesley v. Van Doren, 873 P.2d 1280 (Alaska 1994) (statute of limitations in attorney malpractice cases is not tolled pending final resolution of litigation underlying malpractice claim); Laird v. Blacker, 828 P.2d 691 (Cal. 1992) (limitations period commences and is not tolled by filing an appeal absent continuous representation by the trial attorney);[3] Law Offices of Jerris Leonard, P.C. v. Mideast Sys. Ltd., 111 F.R.D. 359, 363 (D.D.C.1986) (under discovery rule, legal malpractice claim was deemed to have occurred when summary judgment entered against it or at latest when answer was due in suit for legal fees); Zupan v. Berman, 491 N.E.2d 1349, 1351-52 (Ill. 1986) (statute of limitations for legal malpractice began to run when adverse judgment was entered, not when appellate court modified judgment); Chambers v. Dillow, 713 S.W.2d 896, 898-99 (Tenn. 1986) (injury for legal malpractice held to have accrued when lawsuit was initially dismissed). \r\nGenerally, those jurisdictions which adopt the continuous representation rule also adopt the continuous treatment in the context of medical malpractice.Â  See generally Mallen and Smith at Â§ 22.13, p. 430 (noting ruleâ€™s medical malpractice origins); Rosenfield v. Rogin, 795 A.2d 572 (Conn. 2002); Seebacher v. Fitzergerald et al. , 449 N.W.2d 673 (Mich. App. 1989); Skidmore v. Rottman, 450 N.E.2d 684 (Ohio 1983) (holding that cause of action for legal malpractice accrues and the statute of limitations commences to run when the client discovers, or, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have discovered, the resulting injury; court noted that policy considerations underlying discovery rule in medical malpractice cases are no less compelling in legal malpractice cases).Â  \r\nIn accord with these authorities, and in light of the Legislatureâ€™s declaration that an action â€œmust be commenced within three years after the person knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known he had a cause of action,â€[4] we decline to adopt the continuous representation rule.\r\nDr. Epstein asserts that, even if we do not adopt the continuous representation rule, the statute of limitations should not be deemed to have begun to run until the date on which this Court denied certiorari (January 11, 2001), because it was not until that date upon which he suffered â€œlegal damages.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough there is a split of authority as to whether a plaintiff has suffered legally cognizable damages prior to the conclusion of an appeal, those jurisdictions which decline to adopt the continuous representation rule tend to hold that a plaintiff may institute a malpractice action prior to the conclusion of an appeal.Â  See Laird v. Blacker 828 P.2d 691, 696 (Cal. 1992)(disagreeing with plaintiffâ€™s contention that a successful appeal negates the client's ability to file a malpractice action. The court noted that the client sustains an injury as soon as he or she is forced to incur costs pursuing an appeal and that, â€œalthough appellate review may correct judicial error, and thus reduce the client's damages, an appeal does not necessarily exonerate the attorney, nor does it extinguish the client's action against him for negligence in the conduct of trial.â€); Beesley v. VanDoren, 873 P.2d 1280, 1282(Alaska 1994)(rejecting claim that injury or damaging effect on the unsuccessful party is not ascertainable until the appellate process is completed);[5] Michael v. Beasley, 583 So. 2d 245 (Ala. 1991), reversal on other ground recognized by, Borden v. Clements 261 B.R. 275 (Ala. 2001) (on the date of adverse jury verdict, plaintiffs became obligated to expend additional monies for the appellate process including the continuing service of an attorney, the cost of the transcript, the cost of the appeal, and the inconvenience of the appeal. In finding that the plaintiffs' injury accrued on the date of the jury's verdict, the court held that a plaintiff was not required to exhaust all appellate remedies before filing a claim for legal malpractice); St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Speerstra, 666 P.2d 255, 258 (Or. 1983) (plaintiff was held to have suffered harm when trial courtâ€™s judgment was entered, because plaintiff was then required to either pay the judgment or the costs of appeal); Hunt v. Bittman, 482 F.Supp 1017 (D.C. 1980), aff'd, 652 F.2d 196 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 860, 102 S.Ct. 315, 70 L.Ed.2d 158 (1981), (SOL began to run from date of Watergate conspiratorâ€™s conviction, the date on which he suffered actual injury).Â  See generally, Ronald Mallen, Limitations and the Need for Damages in Legal Malpractice Actions, 60 Def. Couns. J. 234, 245-246 (April 1993) (noting that a client who has suffered an adverse result because of a lawyerâ€™s negligence has both knowledge of the negligence and present damage).\r\nEpstein also asserts that requiring him to pursue an appeal while simultaneously filing a malpractice suit against his attorney puts him in the awkward position of arguing inconsistent positions in two different courts.Â  The same may also be raised in the context of continuous medical treatment.Â  In any event, there are measures which may be taken to avoid such inconsistent positions.Â  See Morrison v. Goff, 91 P.3d 1050, 1056 (Co. 2004); Gerhard v. Oâ€™Rourke, 510 N.W.2d 900 (Mich. 1994) (holding that a plaintiff who files a malpractice claim against an attorney at the same time an appeal is pending may seek a stay of the malpractice action in the trial court);[6] Mallen, supra, 60 Def. Couns. J. at 248 (suggesting that during the pendency of an appeal, â€œmost lawyers are willing to stipulate to toll a statute of limitations on the hope that the existence or extent of an injury will be minimized or terminatedâ€ by the appeal).[7]Â Â  \r\nThis Court has recognized that, under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when a reasonable person of common knowledge and experience would be on notice that a claim against another party might exist.Â  The fact that the injured party may not comprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial.Â  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363-364, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).Â  See also Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 442 S.E.2d 169 (1994) (reasonable diligence means simply that injured party must act with some promptness where facts and circumstances of injury would put person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist;Â  statute of limitations begins to run from this point and not when advice of counsel is sought or full-blown theory of recovery is developed); Snell v. Columbia Gun Exchange, Inc., 276 S.C. 301, 278 S.E.2d 333 (1981) (same). \r\nUnder the facts of this case, we find Dr. Epstein clearly knew, or should have known he might have had some claim against Brown at the conclusion of his trial.Â  The damages he claims are largely those to his reputation, and the claims he raises in his complaint are primarily related to trial and pre-trial errors.Â  Counsel for Dr. Epstein conceded at oral argument on the summary judgment motion that â€œsome of the allegations down there, your Honor, were within the manâ€™s knowledge when the verdict came in.â€Â  Further, in a letter from Dr. Epstein to his appellate attorney, Steven Groves, Dr. Epstein indicated both that he would not deal with Mr. Brown, and that â€œI believe that my representation was so egregiously lacking.â€Â  It is patent Dr. Epstein knew, or should have known, of a possible claim against Brown long before this Court denied certiorari in January 2001.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this issue.[8]Â  The judgment below is \r\n AFFIRMED.[9]\r\nMOORE AND BURNETT, JJ., concur, TOAL, CJ., and PLEICONES, J., dissenting in separate opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would adopt a bright-line rule that the statute of limitations does not begin to run in a legal malpractice action until an appellate court disposes of the action by sending a remittitur to the trial court.\r\nI agree that under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations is tolled until the date the injured party either knows or should know, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action exists for the wrongful conduct.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (Supp. 2003); See also Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996) (explaining the discovery rule).Â  In Dean, this Court explained the nature of â€œreasonable diligenceâ€:\r\n\r\n[w]e have interpreted the &quot;exercise of reasonable diligence&quot; to mean that the injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of common knowledge and experience on notice that a claim against another party might exist.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nI disagree with the majorityâ€™s decision holding that the appellants should have known of the existence of a cause of action arising from respondentâ€™s alleged malpractice at the conclusion of the trial.Â  In my opinion, there was no evidence that appellants were injured as a result of respondentâ€™s alleged malpractice until the court of appeals disposed of the case by sending a remittitur to the trial court.Â  Therefore, I would establish a bright-line rule that the statute of limitations does not begin to run in a legal malpractice action until a remittitur has been sent to the trial court.Â  As a result, in my opinion, the statute of limitations does not bar Appellantsâ€™ claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s rejection of the continuous-representation rule and in its retention of the discovery rule.Â  In my opinion, however, Brown should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense.Â  I would therefore reverse and remand to the circuit court for trial.\r\nâ€œUnder South Carolina law, a defendant may be estopped from claiming the statute of limitations as a defense if the delay that otherwise would give operation to the statute ha[s] been induced by the defendant's conduct.â€Â  Kleckley v. N.W. Nat. Cas. Co., 338 S.C. 131, 136, 526 S.E.2d 218, 220 (2000) (internal quotation omitted).Â  â€œSuch inducement may consist of â€¦ conduct that suggests a lawsuit is not necessary.â€Â  Kleckley, 338 S.C. at 136-37, 526 S.E.2d at 220.\r\nBrown affirmatively represented to Epstein that the adverse verdict had resulted from errors of law committed by the trial judge which had in turn affected the juryâ€™s fact-finding role.Â  Brown also remained nominally as counsel to Epstein throughout the appeal from the verdict.Â  I would hold that the circuit court erred by holding that Brownâ€™s representations coupled with his presence on the appellate team did not reasonably induce Epsteinâ€™s forbearance.Â  That Brown did not actually participate in the appellate representation, other than filing the appeal and being counsel of record, makes this conclusion all the more compelling, as his watchful presence bolstered his affirmative representations.Â  I would therefore hold that Brown is estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  Welch was a 37 year old nurse who worked for Epsteinâ€™s neurological group, Southern Neurological Institute, in the care of surgical patients.Â  The facts surrounding his surgery and post-surgical care are fully set forth in the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C.Â  279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n[2] Although Brown remained counsel of record, the appeal was handled by a different firm.\r\n[3]Â  Notably, the California statute specifically has a provision for tolling in the event the attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.Â  Westâ€™s Ann.

Clare, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Respondent Cecil Heyward Dempsey (Dempsey) was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor and was sentenced to thirty years in prison.Â  The court of appeals affirmed.Â  State v. Dempsey, 340 S.C. 365, 532 S.E.2d 306 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Dempsey applied for post conviction relief (PCR) and relief was granted.Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nDempsey was charged with CSC with a minor for sexually abusing his nine-year-old stepson (victim).Â  The victim testified that Dempsey sexually abused him â€œfour times [a week], almost everydayâ€ for a period of more than a year.Â  In addition, the Stateâ€™s case included testimony of the arresting officer and several doctors and counselors at the Low Country Childrenâ€™s Center, a center that specializes in caring for abused children.\r\nThe State offers the following issues for review:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the PCR court err when it found Dempseyâ€™s trial counsel ineffective for failing to subpoena the victimâ€™s grandfather to offer testimony that could have potentially exculpated Dempsey?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the PCR court err when it found Dempseyâ€™s trial counsel ineffective for failing to offer expert testimony on sexual abuse to rebut the stateâ€™s expert testimony?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the PCR court err when it found Dempseyâ€™s trial counsel ineffective for failing to request a jury charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN)?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995)).Â  On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â  If no probative evidence exists to support the findings, the Court will reverse. Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000) (citing Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996)).\r\nFirst, to be entitled to PCR, the applicant must show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient.Â  Payne v. State, 355 S.C. 642, 645, 586 S.E.2d 857, 859 (2003) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688, 694 (1984)).Â  An attorneyâ€™s performance is not deficient if it is reasonable under professional norms. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 117, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625 (1989).Â  Second, the applicant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s deficiency, the result of the proceeding would have been different.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.Â  \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Failure to Subpoena Witness\r\nThe State argues that the PCR judge erred in granting Dempsey relief on the basis that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena an out-of-state witness that would have allegedly offered exculpatory testimony.Â  We agree.\r\nA PCR applicant cannot show that he was prejudiced by counselâ€™s failure to call a favorable witness to testify at trial if that witness does not later testify at the PCR hearing or otherwise offer testimony within the rules of evidence.Â  Glover v. State, 318 S.C. 496, 498, 458 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1995). \r\nIn his PCR application, Dempsey claimed trial counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena the victimâ€™s grandfather, who Dempsey alleged would have testified that the victim lied about being sexually assaulted.Â  At the PCR hearing, counsel admitted that he did not know the proper procedure to subpoena an out-of-state witness.Â  Nevertheless, because we cannot determine what the victimâ€™s grandfather would have said in his testimony, any prejudice to Dempsey is merely speculative.Â  In addition, because the victimâ€™s grandfather did not testify at the PCR hearing or otherwise have his testimony offered, there is no evidence that, if counsel had subpoenaed the witness, the result at trial would have been different.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the PCR court erred in granting relief on the basis that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to subpoena the victimâ€™s grandfather to testify at trial.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFailure to Present Expert Testimony \r\nThe State argues that the PCR judge erred in granting Dempsey relief on the basis that counsel was ineffective for failing to offer expert testimony on child sexual abuse to rebut the testimony of the stateâ€™s expert witness.Â  We agree.\r\nAt trial, the State called Dr. Donald Elsey, a therapist at the Low Country Childrenâ€™s Center, to testify as an expert on child sexual abuse.Â  Dr. Elsey testified that it was his opinion that the victim had been sexually abused.Â  \r\nIn addition, the State presented expert testimony from Dr. Elizabeth Baker who performed the victimâ€™s physical examination.Â  Dr. Baker testified that she found no physical evidence that the victim was sexually abused, but that it was likely that if someone was assaulted in the manner in which the victim alleged, there would be no physical evidence of the assault.Â  Dempseyâ€™s counsel did not call an expert to rebut the Stateâ€™s expert testimony because he believed that the lack of physical evidence of abuse, by itself, was enough to rebut the stateâ€™s expert testimony.\r\nFirst, because Dempsey failed to have an expert on child sexual abuse testify at the PCR hearing, we hold that any finding of prejudice is merely speculative.Â Â Â  Second, we find that counselâ€™s decision not to call an expert witness to rebut the stateâ€™s expert witness was a legitimate trial strategy.Â  See McLaughlin v. State, 352 S.C. 476, 483-484, 575 S.E.2d 841, 844-845 (2003) (holding that where counsel articulates a valid reason for employing a certain trial strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel.) Accordingly, we hold that the PCR court erred in granting relief on the basis that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to call an expert witness on child sexual abuse.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFailure to Request Jury Charge \r\nThe State argues that the PCR judge erred in granting relief on the basis that counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury charge on the lesser-included offense of ABHAN.Â  We agree.\r\nA judge must charge the jury on material issues raised by the evidence. Frasier v. State, 306 S.C. 158, 162, 410 S.E.2d 572, 574 (1991).Â  Nevertheless, a judge is required to charge a jury on a lesser-included offense â€œif there is any evidence from which it could be inferred the lesser, rather than the greater, offense was committed.â€Â  State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 398, 472 S.E.2d 241, 242 (1996) (emphasis supplied).\r\nABHAN is a lesser-included charge of CSC. State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 582, 564 S.E.2d 103, 106 (2002).Â  ABHAN is the unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation. Id. at 580, 564 S.E.2d at 105.Â  Circumstances of aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, intent to commit a felony, infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, taking indecent liberties of familiarities with a female, and resistance to lawful authority.Â  Id. at 580-581, 564 S.E.2d at 105-106.\r\nIn the present case, both the victimâ€™s aunt and the victim testified that Dempsey acted violently towards the victim.Â  The aunt testified that on one occasion she witnessed Dempsey pick up the victim and yell obscenities at him.Â  In addition, victim testified that on another occasion Dempsey â€œjacked [the victim] up against the wallâ€ and threatened to hurt him if he told anyone about the sexual abuse.Â  Nevertheless, the evidence indicates that on several different occasions Dempsey forced the victim to perform various sexual acts.Â  We find that there is no evidence that Dempsey committed ABHAN rather than CSC with a minor on those occasions.\r\nIn this case, Dempsey points to evidence that he physically assaulted the victim to support his claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to request an ABHAN charge.Â  The indictment charged that the CSC occurred between December 1996 and June 1997, during which period there was evidence of several instances of sexual battery.Â  While it is true, as Dempsey contends, that there was also evidence of conduct that could be construed as ABHAN, none of these incidents was alleged to have occurred instead of the sexual batteries.Â  Under these circumstances, where there is no evidence from which it could be inferred that ABHAN rather than CSC was committed, an ABHAN charge is not warranted.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find no evidence of probative value sufficient to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that counsel was ineffective.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT AND PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25955","title":"State v.

Bruck, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Cecil Kelley Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  We granted certiorari to review a Court of Appealsâ€™ decision holding that, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2946 (Supp. 2004), a law enforcement officer may require, without first offering a breath test, a person charged with felony driving under the influence (Felony DUI)[1] to submit to a chemical test of his blood.Â  State v. Long, Op. No. 2003-UP-111 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 12, 2003).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nFollowing a single-car accident, petitioner (Driver) and his two passengers were transported to a hospital.Â  One of the passengers died as a result of injuries received.Â  Around 4 a.m., several hours after Driver arrived at the hospital, a blood sample was taken at the behest of a law enforcement officer.\r\nAt trial, Driver objected to the introduction of the results of this blood test since he alleged he had neither been offered a breath test nor had a licensed medical personnel determined that he was unable to give a breath sample.Â  Driver relied upon the general implied consent statute,[2] which provides â€œthe person must first be offered a breath testâ€¦[unless] the person is physically unable to provide an acceptable breath sample because he has an injured mouth, is unconscious or dead, or for any other reason considered acceptable by the licensed medical personnelâ€¦.â€ before a blood sample may be taken. Â Â§ 56-5-2950(a).Â  The State contended, and the trial judge agreed, that the specific statute applicable to individuals suspected of Felony DUI, Â§ 56-5-2946, obviated the requirement of Â§ 56-5-2950(a) that a breath test be offered or be deemed unavailable, before a blood test is ordered.Â  The test result was admitted, and on appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that\r\nÂ§ 56-5-2946 altered the prerequisites for ordering a blood test of individuals charged with Felony DUI?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe general implied consent statute was rewritten by 1998 Act No. 434, Â§ 7.Â  Section 6 of that same act created Â§ 56-5-2946.Â  We are not asked today to determine all the changes wrought by Â§ 56-5-2946, but only whether this statute alters the general requirement that an officer offer a breath test or obtain a medical opinion that such a test is not feasible before offering a blood test.Â  We hold that it does.\r\nPursuant to Â§ 56-5-2950, a person driving a motor vehicle in South Carolina is deemed to have consented to a chemical test of his breath, blood, or urine if arrested for an offense arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two.Â  Â§ 56-5-2950(a).Â  The arresting officer must first assure the individual is offered a breath test, unless â€œlicensed medical personnelâ€ deems such a test unacceptable.Â  In that case, the officer may request a blood test.Â  Id.Â  The officer must notify the individual of his right to independent testing, and provide affirmative assistance to assist in arranging such testing.Â  Id. \r\nSection 56-5-2950(a) also prescribes certain technical testing requirements, such as requiring an accurate simulator test be performed before the breath test is administered, and that blood and urine samples be obtained by medical personnel.Â  This section also provides civil and criminal immunity to those administering the tests or obtaining the samples in most situations. \r\nPart (b) of Â§ 56-5-2950 provides for certain evidentiary presumptions based upon the alcohol concentrations shown by the tests.Â  Part (c) deems an unconscious person or one otherwise unable to refuse to have been informed as provided by part (a).Â  Part (d) requires the individual be given a written report giving the times and results of tests, and requires him to furnish results of his independent test to the arresting officer if the driver intends to rely upon that test result as evidence.Â  Part (e) provides for judicial or administrative review of regulations, and for the exclusion of evidence if these regulations are not complied with, and part (f) permits fees to be assessed for certain services.\r\nSection 56-5-2946 is entitled â€œSubmission to testing for alcohol or drugs,â€ and applies only to persons believed to have committed Felony DUI.Â  This statute begins with â€œNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a person must submitâ€ to chemical tests to determine alcohol concentration when he is suspected of Felony DUI.Â  The second paragraph of Â§ 56-5-2946 provides, â€œThe tests must be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officerâ€¦A person who is tested or gives samples must be notified of his right to independent tests.â€\r\nThese two paragraphs essentially alter the procedural prerequisites which must be met under Â§ 56-5-2950 before an officer may order a blood test for a Felony DUI suspect.Â  Under Â§ 56-5-2946, the officer need no longer offer a breath test as the first option, nor must he obtain a medical opinion that such a test is not feasible before ordering a test or sample.Â  \r\nDriver contends that Â§ 56-5-2946 retains all the requirements of Â§ 56-5-2950.Â  This contention is based upon Â§ 56-5-2946â€™s third paragraph, which provides:\r\n\r\nThe provisions of Section 56-5-2950, relating to the administration of tests to determine a personâ€™s alcohol concentration, additional tests at the personâ€™s expense, the availability of other evidence on the question of whether or not the person was under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of them, availability of test information to the person or his attorney, and the liability of medical institutions and persons administering the tests are applicable to this section and also extend to the officer requesting the test, the State or its political subdivisions, or governmental agency, or entity which employs the officer making the request, and the agency, institution, or employer, either governmental or private, of persons administering the tests.Â  Notwithstanding any other provision of state law pertaining to confidentiality of hospital records or other medical records, information regarding tests performed pursuant to this section must be released, upon subpoena, to a court, prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, or law enforcement officer in connection with an alleged violation of Section 56-5-2945.\r\n\r\nWe disagree with Driverâ€™s interpretation of this paragraph.Â  The legislature is presumed to intend that its statutes accomplish something.Â  E.g., S.C. Coastal Conserv. League v. S.C. DHEC, 354 S.C. 585, 582 S.E.2d 410 (2003).Â  Driverâ€™s reading of the statute, to duplicate the requirements of Â§ 56-5-2950, renders Â§ 56-5-2946 virtually meaningless.Â  Driverâ€™s construction violates the rule that a statute is presumed to have meaning, and ignores the language of the statute itself.\r\nWe hold that paragraph three of Â§ 56-5-2946 incorporates the technical testing requirements of Â§ 56-5-2950(a).Â  The paragraph also makes clear that the release from liability provisions of Â§ 56-5-2950(a) apply to persons acting pursuant to Â§ 56-5-2946, incorporates other informational requirements of Â§ 56-5-2950(d), and provides for the applicability of the evidentiary rules found in Â§ 56-5-2950(b) and (e).Â  The Court of Appeals was correct in affirming the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the officer was not required to offer a breath test or receive a medical opinion before ordering Driverâ€™s blood test.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nA law enforcement officer can order a person suspected of Felony DUI to submit to any chemical test without first offering a breath test.Â  The decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, CJ., MOORE, WALLER AND BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDesa A. Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct filed formal charges against respondent, Thomas E. Ruffin, Jr.Â  After a hearing, the Panel recommended an indefinite suspension.\r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe charges against respondent stem from his involvement in a real estate deal with two doctors.Â  The Doctors and respondent formed a limited liability company (LLC) for the purpose of purchasing a lot and constructing a building in which respondent could rent law office space.Â  The agreement was for the Doctors to provide the purchase money and then become â€œsilent partnersâ€ with respondent.Â  Respondentâ€™s duties, as the Doctors understood them, were to:Â  (1) handle all architectural fees at no cost to the Doctors; (2) perform all of the legal work involved at no cost;[1] (3) use his contacts in the area with a contractor to construct the building and supervise all construction; and (4) lease the building from the LLC at a fair market value, with plans for the Doctors to get their initial investment back in seven years, and thereafter the LLC would turn a profit for all members.\r\nAn attorney, other than respondent, closed a $300,000 construction loan from Anchor Bank on March 24, 1998.Â  Subsequently, respondent opened the LLC account with Anchor Bank.Â  On the day the LLC account was opened, respondent wrote a check, payable to himself, labeled â€œcosts/expensesâ€ in the amount of $15,000, and then deposited the check into his personal bank account.Â  This check was the beginning of many LLC checks that respondent would write to himself or his law firm.Â  Respondent did not inform the Doctors he was going to write checks from the LLC account to himself and his firm, nor that he would do so in order to pay vendors out of his personal or law firm accounts.\r\nThe allegations of misconduct against respondent in the Formal Charges cover four areas:Â  (1) that respondent engaged in a scheme to misappropriate funds from the LLC; (2) that respondent drafted or participated in the last-minute submission of a settlement agreement, between he and the Doctors, that contained elements inconsistent with settlement agreements he had already signed or put on the record before the circuit court; (3) that respondent participated in or authorized frivolous litigation; and (4) that respondent failed to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation. We separate the allegations into these four categories:Â  The LLC, Misappropriation of Funds, The Litigation, and Failure to Cooperate.\r\nThe LLC\r\nA few months after the LLC closed on the construction loan at Anchor Bank, respondent convinced the Doctors to refinance the loan for $360,000 at another bank.Â  Respondent assured the Doctors the extra $60,000 would never actually be needed and that he would pay the entire amount back.Â  An attorney, other than the previous closing attorney and respondent, conducted the closing for the refinancing.\r\nSubsequently, respondent met with the Doctors and informed them that, although he had paid the contractor for the building being constructed, the contractor had not paid two vendors who then filed mechanicâ€™s liens as a result.Â  One of the Doctors testified respondent stated the Doctors needed to place more money in the LLC account to pay the liens in order to avoid a bad credit rating.Â  Respondent explained that the vendors who filed the liens had a legal right to do so; however, the Doctors believed this advice was incorrect.Â  The Panel found respondent had given false legal advice to his clients.\r\nIn September 1998, the Doctors requested the LLC records from respondent so that they could examine them.Â  After repeated delays by respondent, the Doctors contacted respondent who stated he had taken all the records to Greg Lipe, an accountant.Â  Respondent had not in fact taken any records to Lipe at this time.Â  The Doctorsâ€™ accountant, Lawrence D. Guerry, finally retrieved the records directly from the bank.\r\nWhen the Doctors examined the bank records, they were disturbed because respondent had written LLC checks to himself, his law firm, to his wife in one incident, and because the account had been subject to several insufficient funds fees and other bank fees indicating a mismanagement of the account by respondent.Â  The Doctors also discovered that at least three LLC checks and possibly more, totaling over $13,800, had been written to the respondentâ€™s law firm for legal fees.Â  The Doctors never received a bill or an accounting from respondent has to how he had earned the alleged legal fees.\r\nWhen a settlement could not be reached between the Doctors and respondent with the assistance of their respective attorneys, the Doctors filed a suit against respondent and his firm in July 1999.Â  At the end of July, the attorneys placed a settlement agreement on the record in front of a circuit court judge that provided respondent would purchase the Doctorsâ€™ interest in the LLC for $148,000.Â  The closing did not occur as planned and respondent requested an extension of time.\r\nA closing was eventually set for October 6, 1999.Â  However it did not occur because, on the morning of the closing date, respondentâ€™s attorney, Craig Young, faxed a Severance Agreement to the Doctorsâ€™ attorney, Jerome Askins.Â  This agreement contained items that were not agreed upon.Â  The details of this incident are discussed below under the heading, â€œThe Litigation.â€\r\nAfter a motion to compel settlement and other negotiations, the litigation was eventually settled and the building was sold.Â  As part of the settlement, respondent paid the Doctors the amount of their net loss from the venture.Â  Therefore, the Doctors recovered the money they had lost.\r\nThe Panel found that, while respondent contended he was simply a business partner with the Doctors in this venture and did not perform legal services on their behalf, the facts showed otherwise given that respondent acted as an attorney for the LLC regarding the mechanicâ€™s liens and given that he had written LLC checks, with the label â€œlegalâ€ or â€œlegal feesâ€ to his law firm.\r\nMisappropriation of Funds\r\nRespondent admits he did not maintain detailed records of the transactions involving the LLC account and that he is unable to provide an accounting of the funds that were deposited into the LLC account or to trace the funds into and out of the account.Â  The Panel found it was clear respondent was writing checks back and forth from his two law firm accounts (one at Anchor Bank and one at Carolina First Bank), his personal account, and the LLC account.Â  The Panel stated respondent was expending sums from all of these accounts for items totally unrelated to the building being constructed by the LLC.Â  The Panel found respondent often had negative balances in his personal and law firm accounts.\r\nAlthough there were numerous instances of check writing misconduct, for brevity we cite only two examples:\r\n\r\n(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent wrote LLC check number 115, in the amount of $5,000 to himself, and deposited it into his personal account at Anchor Bank on the same day.Â  The balance in his personal account had been negative (-) $211.95 three days earlier.Â  On the date of the deposit of the LLC check, respondentâ€™s personal account balance rose to $3,924.06.\r\n(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent wrote LLC check number 143, to â€œThomas E. Ruffin, Jr., P.C.,â€ in the amount of $5,550.Â  A deposit was made into the law firm general account (at Carolina First Bank) of $5,500 on July 8 and $50 on July 9.Â  On July 8, the balance in the law firm account rose to negative (-) $955.13 but dropped to negative (-) $5,005.13 on July 9.Â  It rose to $1,494.87 on July 13, 1998, aided by a deposit of $6,500 on that day.Â  That rise was a result of the deposit of LLC check number 151, in the amount of $6,500, written to â€œRuffin Law Firm - General Account.â€Â  That month, there were nine insufficient funds fees on respondentâ€™s law firm account at Carolina First Bank.\r\n\r\nRespondentâ€™s accountant, after analyzing the cost of the construction project and respondentâ€™s transfer of funds from the LLC account to respondentâ€™s law firm accounts or personal account, determined that the total amount due appeared to be $30,390.70.Â  The Attorney to Assist (ATA), who was appointed to investigate this matter, concluded there was a total shortage of $30,023.45.[2]Â  The Doctorsâ€™ accountant, Lawrence D. Guerry, testified it was disturbing that respondentâ€™s LLC checks were almost always in round figures, which, he testified, is atypical of checks written to vendors in a construction project.\r\nThe Litigation\r\nThe Doctorsâ€™ attorney, Jerome Askins, III, (Askins) testified that, in the beginning of his representation of the Doctors, he made several unsuccessful attempts to meet with respondent to discuss the LLC bank records.Â  Once a meeting was held, it became apparent respondent had engaged in financial misconduct in relation to the LLC account.Â  Askins filed suit on behalf of the Doctors when negotiations with respondent to buy the building were unsuccessful.Â  The matter was finally scheduled for a settlement and closing on October 6, 1999.Â  On that date, Askins received a fax, which changed the previous agreement.Â  He testified this new agreement, known as the Severance Agreement, was not a part of the settlement that had previously been placed on the record.\r\nParagraph 5 of the agreement stated that respondent had never served as an attorney for the Doctors or the LLC; however, respondent had in fact represented the LLC in mechanicâ€™s lien actions. \r\nParagraph 6 of the agreement faxed by respondentâ€™s attorney, Young, was a confidentiality clause and a statement of the penalty upon the Doctors if the confidentiality should be breached.[3]\r\nThereafter, Young filed a Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint involving RICO violations.[4]Â  As a result, Askins had to withdraw from representing the Doctors and the Doctors had to find new counsel.Â  Subsequently, the circuit court issued an order, which noted the third party action against Askins had been ended by the payment of $10,000 to Askins from respondent.\r\nFailure to Cooperate\r\nThe Commission requested that respondent deliver certain bank records to the investigator.Â  Respondent only partially complied with the request.Â  He failed to provide all of the bank statements, cancelled checks, and deposit slips that were requested.Â  Respondent admits that, due to poor record-keeping, he is unable to provide all of the requested financial information.\r\nPanelâ€™s Findings\r\nThe Panel found the following violations of Rule 7(a) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  7(a)(1), violating a Rule of Professional Conduct; 7(a)(3), failing to fully comply with a subpoena issued by the Commission; 7(a)(5), engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law; and 7(a)(6), violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this State.\r\nThe Panel further found respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The Panel found violations of Rule 1.1, competence; Rule 1.2, scope of representation; Rule 1.5, fees; Rule 1.7, conflict of interest; Rule 1.15, safekeeping property; Rule 3.1, meritorious claims and contentions; Rule 3.3, candor toward a tribunal; Rule 3.4, fairness to opposing party and counsel; Rule 4.1, truthfulness in statements to others; Rule 8.1(b), failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority; Rule 8.4(a), violating the Rules of Professional Conduct; Rule 8.4(c), engaging in conduct involving moral turpitude; Rule 8.4(d), engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and Rule 8.4(e) engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.[5]\r\nThe Panel found respondentâ€™s misconduct was mitigated by the eventual settlement and the fact that respondent did not have a prior disciplinary record.Â  The Panel concluded the appropriate sanction was an indefinite suspension and a requirement that respondent pay the costs of the proceedings.Â  Both Disciplinary Counsel and respondent have raised issues regarding the Panelâ€™s report.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the Panel err by failing to find respondent had engaged in check kiting?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the Panel err by failing to find respondent had filed a third party RICO action without a sufficient factual basis?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the Panel err by finding respondent violated certain rules of the Rules for Professional Conduct?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nDisciplinary Counsel argues the Panel erred by failing to find respondent had violated Rule 8.4(b) of the Rules for Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, by engaging in check kiting.Â  Rule 8.4(b) defines attorney misconduct to include committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on a lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\r\nWe find the Panel did not err by failing to find a violation of Rule 8.4(b) because there was no evidence of check kiting.Â  Check kiting involves creating artificial balances in an account until funds are received to cover shortages in that account.Â  While respondent wrote checks from the LLC account presumably to cover his personal and law firm accounts that had insufficient funds to cover checks he had written from those accounts, there is no evidence respondent was engaged in an intentional scheme to kite checks.Â  Cf. In re Miller, 328 S.C. 283, 494 S.E.2d 120 (1997) (disbarment administered for soliciting assistance of other persons to engage in check kiting); In re Robson, 318 S.C. 77, 456 S.E.2d 374 (1995) (disbarment administered for entering guilty plea to check kiting); In re Gibbes, 323 S.C. 80, 450 S.E.2d 588 (1994) (disbarment administered for devising and implementing check kiting scheme).Â  Further, there is no evidence respondent was â€œknowingly covering checks drawn on insufficient funds with worthless checks deposited from other accounts and taking advantage of the lag time necessary for clearance of the checks to keep the â€˜kiteâ€™ afloat.â€Â  In re Gates, 311 S.C. 246, 247, 428 S.E.2d 716, 717 (1993) (emphasis added).Â  The LLC checks respondent used to eliminate negative balances in his personal and law firm accounts were not worthless.\r\nAccordingly, the Panel did not err by failing to find respondent had violated Rule 8.4(b) because there is no evidence respondent engaged in check kiting.Â  See In re Flom, 356 S.C. 246, 588 S.E.2d 593 (2003) (disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence).\r\nII\r\nDisciplinary counsel argues the Panel erred by failing to find respondent had, through his counsel, frivolously filed a third party RICO complaint against the Doctorsâ€™ attorney, Jerome Askins.Â  Specifically, Disciplinary Counsel argues the Panel erred by failing to find respondent had violated Rule 3.1, meritorious claims and contentions; Rule 3.3, candor to a tribunal; Rule 3.4, fairness to opposing party and counsel; and Rule 8.4 (misconduct), subsections (a), (d), and (e).Â  However, the Panel in fact found respondent had violated all of those rules and that he had frivolously filed the RICO complaint.Â  Therefore, Disciplinary Counselâ€™s argument is without merit.\r\nHowever, we disagree with the Panelâ€™s finding that respondent frivolously filed the RICO complaint because there is not clear and convincing evidence of this misconduct.Â  See In re Flom, supra (disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence).Â  Respondent testified he relied on the advice of his attorney because the area of RICO law was not within his area of expertise.Â  Therefore, the Panel erred by finding respondent violated Rule 3.1, which states a lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous.\r\nIII\r\nRespondent argues the Panel erred by finding he had violated certain Professional Rules.Â  We agree with respondent in part.\r\nInitially, we disagree with the Panelâ€™s finding that a legal relationship, outside of the mechanicâ€™s lien actions, existed between respondent and the Doctors.Â  There is a dispute in the testimony as to whether a legal relationship existed.Â  The Doctors testified respondent was to act as their attorney and the LLCâ€™s attorney by preparing documents related to the LLC and by performing the closings on the real estate and the loan refinancing.Â  Respondent testified he never informed the Doctors that he would be performing legal work and that he told the Doctors that he would be able to get legal work done by another attorney for a reduced rate.Â  Consistent with respondentâ€™s testimony, the real estate and refinancing closings were performed by other attorneys.Â  Further, another attorney assisted in the preparation of the LLC documents.\r\nWhile the Panel finds a legal relationship existed partially on the basis that checks, denoted â€œlegalâ€ or â€œlegal fees,â€ from the LLC account were made out to respondent or his law firm, we do not find this fact dispositive.Â  It is clear that attorneys, other than respondent, handled the legal issues that arose with the LLC.Â  Therefore, it appears respondent may have used these particular checks to take money from the LLC account for a seemingly proper reason.\r\nGiven we may make our own findings of fact and conclusions of law in a disciplinary action, we find respondent did not have a general legal relationship with the Doctors and the LLC.Â  In re Wilkes, 359 S.C. 540, 598 S.E.2d 272 (2004) (Court may make own findings of fact and conclusions of law in disciplinary action).Â  The allegation that respondentâ€™s misconduct arose out of the existence of a legal relationship was not proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  See In re Flom, supra (disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence).\r\nBecause we find a general legal relationship did not exist between respondents and the Doctors or the LLC, we find the Panel erred by finding respondent violated Rule 1.2 (scope of representation), Rule 1.7 (conflict of interest), and Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property).\r\nRespondent argues the Panel erred by finding he had violated Rule 7(a)(5), Rule 1.1, Rule 3.3., Rule 3.4, and Rule 4.1.Â  We uphold the Panelâ€™s findings that respondent violated Rule 7(a)(5), Rule 3.3, and Rule 3.4 without comment.\r\nRegarding Rule 1.1. (competence), we find the Panel did not err by finding a Rule 1.1 violation because respondent incorrectly advised the Doctors regarding mechanicâ€™s liens actions that had been filed against the LLC.Â  Regarding respondentâ€™s misstatements to the Doctors, the Panel also found respondent had violated Rule 4.1, which provides:Â  â€œIn the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:Â  (a) Make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person . . . .â€Â  Whether respondentâ€™s advice was simply due to incompetence or due to respondentâ€™s desire to acquire more money from the Doctors is unclear.Â  Because there is not clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rule 4.1, we find the Panel erred by finding respondent violated this rule.Â  See In re Flom, supra (disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence).\r\nSANCTION\r\nThis Court has the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record.Â  In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 539 S.E.2d 396 (2000).Â  The Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and is not bound by the Panelâ€™s recommendation.Â  In re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).Â  The Court must administer the sanction it deems appropriate after a thorough review of the record.Â  Id.\r\nWe have deemed indefinite suspension the appropriate sanction in similar cases.Â  See In re Perrow, 346 S.C. 515, 552 S.E.2d 295 (2001) (indefinite suspension where attorney issued check to himself that exceeded his fee in several cases and used funds in escrow account to pay for repairs to residence);

Clare, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nHenry Dargan McMaster, John W. McIntosh, Salley W. Elliott, and Elizabeth R. McMahon, all of the Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Robert Lee Leamon (Petitioner) pled guilty to five counts of armed robbery and was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for twenty-five years on each count.Â  The post-conviction relief (PCR) judge concluded Petitionerâ€™s PCR application was time-barred.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner was jailed in North Carolina on December 6, 1992.Â Â Â  On December 9, 1992, South Carolina placed a detainer on Petitioner.Â  In October 1995, Petitioner was indicted by the Greenville County Grand Jury for five counts of armed robbery.Â  Petitioner was transported to South Carolina and on November 20, 1995, he pled guilty to those charges.Â  After pleading guilty, Petitioner was returned to North Carolina to serve his remaining sentence for crimes committed in that jurisdiction.Â  \r\nOn November 22, 1999, after serving his sentence in North Carolina, Petitioner was transferred to South Carolina to complete his sentence for the armed robbery convictions.Â  Petitioner filed his PCR application on May 19, 2000.Â  The PCR judge dismissed the PCR application, finding it was filed after the one-year statutory filing period.Â  Petitioner appeals and requests this Court remand the case for a full evidentiary hearing.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDoes the statute of limitations for PCR applications, S.C. CodeÂ  Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003), apply to an applicant who is incarcerated in another jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary dismissal of a PCR application without a hearing is appropriate only when (1) it is apparent on the face of the application that there is no need for a hearing to develop any facts and (2) the applicant is not entitled to relief.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-70(b) and (c) (2003).Â  When considering the Stateâ€™s motion for summary dismissal of an application, where no evidentiary hearing has been held, the circuit court must assume facts presented by an applicant are true and view those facts in the light most favorable to the applicant.Â  Similarly, when reviewing the propriety of a dismissal, this Court must view the facts in the same fashion.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-80 (2003) (PCR actions are governed by usual rules of civil procedure); Wilson v. State, 348 S.C. 215, 559 S.E.2d 581 (2002); Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 364, 527 S.E.2d 742, 747 (2000).\r\nIn a case raising a novel issue of law, the appellate court is free to decide the question of law with no particular deference to the trial court.Â  Osprey v. Cabana Ltd. Partn., 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000); Iâ€™On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718 (2000).Â  The Court will reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision when it is controlled by an error of law.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 651, 594 S.E.2d 462, 465 (2004); Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues he filed his PCR application within one year from the date he returned to South Carolina.Â  Petitioner contends this Court should extend the rationale set forth in Odom v. State, 337 S.C. 256, 523 S.E.2d 753 (1999), and rule Petitioner was denied his â€œone bite at the appleâ€ because his involuntary detention in North Carolina prevented him from timely filing his PCR application.Â  We disagree.\r\nA PCR application ordinarily â€œmust be filed within one year after the entry of a judgment of conviction or within one year after the sending of the remittitur to the lower court from an appeal or the filing of the final decision upon an appeal, whichever is later.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003).Â  \r\nWe conclude incarceration in another state does not toll the running of the statute of limitations.Â Â  Petitioner had a full year to submit a post-conviction petition.Â  Ignorance of the statute of limitations is not an excuse for late filing, even when the Petitioner claims he did not learn of the statute because he was incarcerated in another state.Â  See e.g., Brown v. State, 928 S.W.2d 453, 456 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996); Phillips v. State, 890 S.W.2d 37, 38 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994).\r\nPetitioner relies on this Courtâ€™s decisions in Carter v. State, 337 S.C. 17, 522 S.E.2d 342 (1999) and Wilson v. State, 348 S.C. 215, 559 S.E.2d 581 (2002) in arguing for equitable relief.Â  These cases are distinguishable from the present case.\r\nIn Carter, the defendant was incarcerated in federal prison.Â  The PCR judge dismissed the defendantâ€™s PCR application without prejudice allowing the defendant the right to apply for PCR when he was later incarcerated in a State facility.Â  This Court affirmed the PCR judgeâ€™s dismissal of the case without prejudice to the defendantâ€™s right to later file an application.Â  The present case is distinguishable.Â  In Carter, the State consented to the dismissal of the PCR application after the statute of limitations had run and agreed the defendant should be allowed to refile at a subsequent date.Â  Therefore, the State was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations.Â  Carter, 337 S.C. at 19, 522 S.E.2d at 342.\r\nPetitioner contends this Courtâ€™s holding in Wilson supports Petitionerâ€™s argument for equitable relief.Â  We disagree.Â  In Wilson, the defendant instructed his attorney to appeal his conviction and the attorney failed to do so.Â  Wilson filed a PCR application alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  The PCR judge dismissed the defendantâ€™s claim because it was untimely under the statute of limitations.Â  This Court reversed the PCR judge and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to determine if the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to direct appeal.Â  Wilson, 348 S.C. at 218, 559 S.E.2d at 583.Â  In the present case, Petitioner does not allege he instructed his attorney to appeal his conviction.\r\nPetitioner also relies on this Courtâ€™s decision in Clayton v. State, 278 S.C. 655, 301 S.E.2d 133 (1983).Â  In Clayton, the Court concluded the State does not have the duty and authority to ensure an out-of-state prisonerâ€™s presence at a South Carolina PCR hearing.Â  However, the fact that the State is not required to transport federal inmates for State PCR proceedings, does not prevent an out-of-state inmate from filing a PCR application within the statute of limitations.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the PCR judge and conclude a prisonerâ€™s incarceration in another jurisdiction does not equitably toll the limitations period for post-conviction relief.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER AND PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25958","title":"Winns v.

McFarland, all of Columbia, for petitioner-respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  The post-conviction relief (PCR) judge vacated respondent-petitioner Herman Winnsâ€™s conviction for murder, after finding that the indictment was defective because it failed to state the time and place of the victimâ€™s death.Â  The PCR judge also ruled that Winnsâ€™s claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit.Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari on the indictment issue and Winnsâ€™s petition for certiorari on the ineffective assistance of counsel issues.Â  After careful consideration, we dismiss Winnâ€™s petition for certiorari as improvidently granted on the ineffective assistance of counsel issues, and we reverse the PCRâ€™s judgeâ€™s ruling on the indictment\r\nissue. \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn a Friday afternoon, after having been laid off from his job earlier in the week, Winns went to St. Stephens, South Carolina, to visit some family and friends.Â  Once there, Winns decided to buy some crack cocaine.Â  A friend suggested that Winns visit John Arthur Mouzon, the victim, who was a known drug dealer and lived in Belangia Apartments.Â  Winns and Mouzon had never met before.Â  At approximately 1:30 p.m., Winns went to Mouzonâ€™s apartment and bought $50 worth of crack cocaine and smoked it in Mouzonâ€™s apartment. \r\nAfter Winns spent all of his money, he asked Mouzon for a ride to Winnsâ€™s auntâ€™s house.Â  Winnsâ€™s aunt gave him $20, which he used to buy more crack cocaine.Â  Although Winns went to a local convenience store at least four or five times to purchase beer, and visited other people in the area, he spent most of the afternoon and evening at Mouzonâ€™s apartment.Â  Winns eventually ran out of money again, and asked Mouzon if he would give Winns some crack cocaine anyway, and Mouzon did.\r\nWinns testified that later that night, he and Mouzon were sitting on the couch when Mouzon put his hand on Winnsâ€™s thigh.Â  Because of this, Winns decided to leave.Â  But before leaving, Winns went into the bathroom, and when he came out, Winns found Mouzon lying on the bed, naked, with a sheet pulled up to his waist.Â  Winns testified that, instead of leaving right away, he walked toward the bed to get more crack cocaine.Â  When Winns was by the bed, Mouzon grabbed Winns by the groin, pulled him onto the bed, and told him that he needed to pay him back for the crack he had given him.Â  Winns reacted by hitting Mouzon on the head several times with an iron[1] until Mouzon released his grip. \r\nAt approximately 3:40 a.m., Winns left the apartment with the iron in his hand, eventually throwing it into the bushes.Â  Later, at approximately 7:30 a.m., Mouzonâ€™s cousin came to the apartment and found Mouzon lying on the bed.Â  She said he was cold and did not have a pulse.Â  The police arrived later that morning and determined that Mouzon had been dead for a while.Â  That afternoon, Winns turned himself in and admitted that he struck Mouzon with the iron.\r\nAt trial, the central issue was whether Winns acted in self-defense or whether his actions constituted manslaughter or murder.Â  The jury found Winns guilty of murder and the judge sentenced Winns to life imprisonment.Â  Winns appealed and this Court affirmed his conviction.Â  State v. Winns, Mem. Op. No. 00-MO-078 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 26, 2000).Â  Winns applied for PCR.\r\nAfter a hearing, the PCR judge found that the indictment was flawed because it did not state the time and place of the victimâ€™s death.Â  As a result, the judge vacated the conviction, finding that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The judge also ruled that Winnsâ€™s ineffective assistance of counsel claims lacked merit.\r\nThe State petitioned this Court for certiorari on the indictment issue, and Winns petitioned on the ineffective assistance of counsel issues.Â  This Court granted both petitions.Â  But after careful consideration, we dismiss certiorari as improvidently granted on the ineffective assistance of counsel issues, and address only the following issue, raised by the State:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err in vacating Winnsâ€™s conviction on the basis that the indictment failed to state the time and place of the victimâ€™s death? \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).Â  On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value to support them.Â  Id. at 109-110, 525 S.E.2d at 517.Â  \r\nTo establish a claim that counsel was ineffective, a PCR applicant must show that counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688, 694 (1984); Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcomeâ€ of the trial.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\r\nIndictment\r\nThe State argues that the PCR judge erred in ruling that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the indictment failed to state the time and place of the victimâ€™s death.Â  We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina statutory law provides the following:\r\n\r\nEvery indictment for murder shall be deemed and adjudged sufficient and good in law which, in addition to setting forth the time and place, together with a plain statement, divested of all useless phraseology, of the manner in which the death of the deceased was caused, charges that the defendant did feloniously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought kill and murder the deceased.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-30 (1985).\r\nMoreover, this Court has held that an indictment for murder is sufficient â€œif the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer, and if an acquittal or a conviction thereon may be pleaded as a bar to any subsequent prosecution.â€ Joseph v. State, 351 S.C. 551, 561, 571 S.E.2d 280, 285 (2002) (citing State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 648, 552 S.E.2d 745, 751 (2001)).Â  In addition, the court must look at the indictment with a practical eye in view of the surrounding circumstances.Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1993).Â  Whether an indictment could be more certain or definite is irrelevant.Â  State v. Knuckles, 354 S.C. 626, 628, 583 S.E.2d 51, 51-52 (2003).\r\nIn the present case, the PCR judge ruled that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the indictment did not allege the time and place of the victimâ€™s death.Â  Accordingly, the PCR judge vacated Winnsâ€™s conviction.Â  In support of this ruling, the PCR court cited State v. Rector, 158 S.C. 212, 155 S.E. 383 (1930).Â  In that case, the Court held that the use of the words â€œthen and thereâ€ sufficiently stated the time and place of death because those terms clearly referred back to the only date and place listed in the indictment.Â  Id. at 216, 155 S.E. at 387.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the case at hand, the indictment reads as follows:\r\n\r\nThat HERMAN WINNS did in Berkeley County on or about October 4, 1997 while at apartment #5 at Belangia Apartments in the town of St. Stephen, South Carolina, with malice aforethought, strike John Arthur Mouzon several times in the head with a metal object, said blows to the head being the proximate cause of the death of John Arthur Mouzon.Â  This action being in violation of Â§16-3-10, South Carolina Code of Law (1976), as amended.\r\n\r\nWe hold that the PCR court erred in finding the indictment defective.Â  Although the indictment did not state that Mouzon did â€œthen and thereâ€ die, the only logical reading of the indictment is that on October 4, 1997, Winns hit Mouzon in the head several times, at the Belangia Apartments, and Mouzon died either at the time he was attacked or soon thereafter.Â  The indictment provides the time of death (October 4, 1997) and the place of death (the Belangia Apartments, St. Stephens, South Carolina).Â  Had the victim been found in a different location or on a different date, the indictment, as written, may have been insufficient.Â  But because Mouzon was found dead in his bed, on the same day and in the same place where Winns struck him, and because the indictment explained that the blows to the head were the â€œproximate cause of death,â€ we find that the indictment states the offense of murder with sufficient certainty and particularity such that Winns knew what he was being called upon to answer.[2]Â  Accordingly, the indictment was not defective.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the PCR courtâ€™s ruling vacating Winnsâ€™s conviction, and hold that the indictment was sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction. \r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In reviewing the sufficiency of an indictment, we look solely to the words used therein and not to the evidence adduced at trial.Â  Here, the post-conviction relief (PCR) judge, relying upon this Courtâ€™s long-established precedent, found the murder indictment invalid because it failed to sufficiently allege the time and place of the victimâ€™s death as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-30 (1985).Â  I agree, and would therefore affirm.\r\nThe â€œtime and place of deathâ€ requirement found in Â§ 17-19-30 merely codifies the common law.Â  State v. Rector, 158 S.C. 212, 155 S.E. 385 (1930).Â  Where the indictment references the place and date of the assault, and alleges that the victim died â€œthen and there,â€ this requirement has been satisfied.Â  Id.; see also State v. Platt, 154 S.C. 1, 151 S.E. 206 (1930); State v. Blakeney, 33 S.C. 111, 11 S.E. 637 (1890).Â  The present indictment alleges the time and place of the assault, but is silent on the time and place of the victimâ€™s death.Â  As the Court said in State v. Rector:\r\n\r\nThe crime of murder is a composite one.Â  It includes the assault committed upon a person . . . and the resulting death from that assault.Â  The State must prove not only the assault and the death occurring from it, but the time of the assault and the time of the death, as time is recognized in the law.Â  In addition, the state [sic] must prove the place of the assault and the place of death.Â  These necessary elements of the crime of murder must not only be proved, before a person accused may be lawfully convicted, but they must be alleged in the indictment returned against the accused by the grand jury.Â  The provisions of the Constitution, recognizing and following the principles of the common law, require the indictment to contain allegations to those effects.\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge correctly vacated respondent-petitionerâ€™s murder conviction, there being no valid indictment charging him with that offense.Â  In light of this, there is no need to address the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. \r\n\r\n[1] The iron was the type heated by a stove and used for ironing clothes. \r\n[2] We note that our decision in this case is consistent with the recently published opinion of State v.

Williamsburg County, 353 S.C. 596, 579 S.E.2d 136 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn February 1, 1996, Respondent (Hurd) was struck by an automobile after he exited a bus owned and operated by Petitioners Williamsburg County and the Williamsburg County Transit Authority (collectively referred to as the â€œTransit Authorityâ€).Â Â  \r\nAt approximately 6:00 AM on February 1, 1996, Hurd boarded the bus in route to Myrtle Beach.Â  The busâ€™ interim destination was a transfer station, known as a â€œPark and Ride,â€ where passengers could purchase tokens, board buses, and transfer to other locations.Â  Before arriving at the Park and Ride, the bus stopped on the shoulder of the road across a two-lane highway from Mingoâ€™s store, a gas station and restaurant.Â  Hurd testified he was â€œhalf awake and half asleepâ€ when the bus stopped.Â  The stopping of the bus roused Hurd, whereupon he asked the bus driver where the disembarking passengers were going.Â  The driver informed Hurd the passengers were going for breakfast at Mingoâ€™s.Â  Hurd stated he exited and walked to the rear of the bus, to join the other passengers, without any instructions from the driver. \r\nHurd testified the bus began to pull off the shoulder and into the highway as Hurd approached the highway.Â  The bus was moving when Hurd stepped into the highway.Â  Because Hurd was standing at the rear of the bus where the engine is located, he was not able to hear the oncoming car.Â  Hurd testified he was unable to see the car because of the angle of the moving bus and stepped into the highway.Â  The driver of the car stated he never saw Hurd prior to impact.Â  \r\nRespondent filed suit against Petitioners and the jury returned a verdict finding Hurd 42 percent at fault and the Transit Authority 58 percent at fault.Â  The jury awarded Hurd $675,000 in damages.Â  The trial court reduced the award of damages to $250,000 pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (SCTCA).Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the juryâ€™s verdict finding the trial court did not err in denying Transit Authority a directed verdict.Â  Transit Authority appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals change the common law standard of negligence in determining the trial judge properly submitted the case to the jury?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in concluding Hurd presented evidence allowing the inference that the Transit Authorityâ€™s actions were the proximate cause of the accident?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in concluding Hurd presented evidence Transit Authorityâ€™s negligence exceeded Hurdâ€™s negligence?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWhen reviewing a ruling on a motion for directed verdict, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  F &amp; D Elec. Contractors, Inc. v. Powder Coaters, Inc., 350 S.C. 454, 567 S.E.2d 842 (2002).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, the trial judge must submit the case to the jury.Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 503 S.E.2d 717 (1998).Â  We will reverse the trial court if there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision to submit the case to the jury.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999).Â  \r\nI.\r\nTransit Authority argues the Court of Appeals erred in changing the common law standard of negligence from reasonable care to â€œbest choice careâ€ in concluding Transit Authority was not entitled to a directed verdict.Â  Specifically, Transit Authority contends Hurd was let off in a position of reasonable safety and Hurd failed to present evidence establishing Transit Authority breached any duty of safety owed to Hurd.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDuring the trial, Robert Roberts, an expert in the area of traffic engineering and traffic and pedestrian safety, testified it was unreasonable for the bus driver to discharge the passengers on the shoulder of Highway 41.Â  Roberts also testified that the Park and Ride was a safety device, among other things.Â  Booker T. Pressley, a former director of the Transit Authority, testified that chief among the concerns that led to the Countyâ€™s construction of the Park and Ride was high traffic congestion.Â  Pressley stated Transit Authorityâ€™s policy is to only let passengers off at the Park and Ride on Highway 41 because of the congestion.Â  See Caldwell v. K-Mart Corp., 306 S.C. 27, 31-32, 410 S.E.2d 21, 24 (Ct. App. 1991) (when defendant adopts internal policies or self-imposed rules and thereafter violates those policies or rules, jury may consider such violations as evidence of negligence if they proximately caused a plaintiffâ€™s damages).Â  Because more than one inference could be drawn from this evidence, we conclude the Court of Appeals correctly found the trial judge did not err in denying Transit Authorityâ€™s motion for directed verdict.[1]\r\nThe Court of Appeals did not heighten the standard of care in concluding Hurd presented evidence supporting his allegation that he was not discharged in a reasonably safe place.Â  Instead, the Court of Appeals relied on this Courtâ€™s decision in Flynn v. Carolina Scenic Stages, 237 S.C. 340, 117 S.E.2d 364 (1960).Â  In Flynn, this Court acknowledged that the relation of passenger and a common carrier ordinarily ends when the passenger steps from a bus into a reasonably safe place on a public highway.Â  However, a carrier is not then wholly discharged of any duty whatsoever to such passenger.Â  It still owes the duty of exercising ordinary care to see that after alighting safely the passenger is not in a position or situation as to be imperiled by the starting up of the bus.Â  Flynn, 237 S.C. at 345, 117 S.E.2d 364 at 367.Â  We conclude the trial judge properly submitted the case to the jury because Hurd presented evidence based on the facts of this case that the shoulder of the highway was not a reasonably safe place to allow Hurd to exit the bus.\r\nII.\r\nTransit Authority argues the Court of Appeals erred in concluding Hurd presented evidence that Transit Authorityâ€™s actions were the proximate cause of Hurdâ€™s injuries.Â  Transit Authority contends the side of the road where the bus discharged passengers departing for Mingoâ€™s was a place of reasonable safety as a matter of law.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn a negligence action the plaintiff must prove proximate cause.Â  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 426 S.E.2d 802 (1993).Â  â€œOrdinarily, the question of proximate cause is one of fact for the jury and the trial judgeâ€™s sole function regarding the issue is to inquire whether particular conclusions are the only reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.â€Â  McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 349, 499 S.E.2d 488, 497 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Proximate cause requires proof of both causation in fact and legal cause.Â  Oliver v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 309 S.C. 313, 422 S.E.2d 128 (1992).Â  Causation in fact is proved by establishing the plaintiffâ€™s injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Oliver, 309 S.C. at 316, 422 S.E.2d at 130.Â  Legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability.Â  Id.Â  An injury is foreseeable if it is the natural and probable consequence of a breach of duty.Â  Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nWe conclude Hurd presented evidence of both factual and legal causation.Â  Hurd presented evidence that â€œbut forâ€ the bus pulling out concurrently with Hurd attempting to cross the road, Hurd would not have been struck by the oncoming car.Â  Hurd also presented evidence that the vehicle-pedestrian accident was foreseeable.Â  Pressleyâ€™s testimony is evidence suggesting (1) the Transit Authority knew that the location of the accident was dangerous to pedestrians; (2) the County constructed the Park and Ride to minimize known dangers at this intersection; (3) the Transit Authority implemented a policy that all drivers were to use the Park and Ride rather than the shoulder of the Highway; (4) the Transit Authority violated its own safety policy by discharging Hurd and the other passengers on the side of the highway; (5) Transit Authority issued the bus driver a warning for violating the safety policy on the date of the accident; and (6) the starting of the bus prevented Hurd from hearing or seeing traffic on the highway.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing evidence, the Court of Appeals was correct in affirming the trial judgeâ€™s decision to allow the question of proximate cause to go to the jury.Â  Hurd does not contend the Transit Authorityâ€™s negligence was the sole cause of his injuries.Â  Nevertheless, Hurd presented evidence at trial that the Transit Authorityâ€™s negligence contributed to the accident.Â  Therefore, the case was properly submitted to the jury.\r\nIII.\r\nTransit Authority argues the Court of Appeals erred in concluding Hurd presented evidence that Transit Authorityâ€™s negligence exceeded Hurdâ€™s own negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\nA plaintiff may only recover damages if his own negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 529 S.E.2d 710 (2000).Â  The determination of respective degrees of negligence attributable to the plaintiff and the defendant presents a question of fact for the jury, at least where conflicting inferences may be drawn.Â  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997).Â  In a comparative negligence case, the trial court should grant a motion for directed verdict if the sole reasonable inference from the evidence is that the non-moving partyâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.Â  Bloom, 339 S.C. at 422, 529 S.E.2d at 713.\r\nWe conclude the Court of Appeals correctly determined Hurd presented evidence allowing the jury to draw a reasonable inference that Transit Authorityâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.Â  A directed verdict for Transit Authority would have been inappropriate because Hurd presented evidence that Transit Authority violated its own safety policy by discharging passengers on the shoulder of the road.Â  This evidence is reinforced by Transit Authorityâ€™s own admission that the driver of the bus was given a warning in connection with the incident.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause there is evidence that would allow a jury to conclude Transit Authority was negligent in discharging Hurd on the shoulder of the road, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.\r\n MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., and PLEICONES, J., dissenting in separate opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the Transit Authority exercised reasonable care in dropping off its passenger.Â  Therefore, I would reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision holding that the Transit Authority breached its duty of care to Hurd.\r\nI disagree with the majority because, in my opinion, the majority holds the Transit Authority to a higher duty of care than what is required of common carriers.Â  A common carrier is required to allow a passenger to exit the bus in a reasonably safe place.Â  Flynn v. Carolina Scenic Stages, 237 S.C. 340, 345, 117 S.E.2d 364, 366-367 (1960).Â  Further, the relationship between passenger and carrier ordinarily ends when the passenger steps from a bus into a reasonably safe place on a public highway.Â  Id.Â  Other courts have been reluctant to hold common carriers liable for injuries suffered after the passenger safely exits.Â  See e.g. Burton v. Des Moines Metro. Transit Auth., 530 N.W.2d 696, 699 (Iowa 1995) (holding that the duty of a common carrier ends when the passenger safely exits and carriers are not liable for injuries caused by the passengers decision to step into traffic).Â  In Burton, the Iowa Supreme Court explained the rationale for holding that a carrierâ€™s duty ends once a passenger exits the bus:\r\n\r\n[A]fter alighting, the passengerâ€™s individual choice directs where he or she will walk, the passenger is in a better position to guard against the dangers of moving vehicles and common sense, logic, and public policy simply do not support extending a duty of care of the public carrier to insure that once the passenger has safely departed, the streets will be free from defect.Â  \r\n\r\nId. (citing Connolly v. Rogers, 599 N.Y.S.2d 731, 732 (N.Y. App. Div. 1993) (quoting Blye v. Mahattan, 511 N.Y.S.2d 612, 615, affâ€™d, 528 N.E.2d 1225 (N.Y. 1988)) (emphasis added).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, the Transit Authority dropped Hurd off on the shoulder of the road, out of harmâ€™s way.Â  The gravel shoulder was a defined turn out at least 200 feet long and at least twice as wide as the bus.Â  Hurd then chose to cross the street, taking himself out of a safe place and inserting himself into a dangerous place, that is, the middle of the road.Â  Hurd claims that the Transit Authority bus blocked vision when it pulled off, but the fact is, Hurd was in a safe place until he decided to cross the street before he could see clearly.[2]Â  In essence, he walked right out in front of a car with its lights on.Â  In my opinion, the Transit Authority fulfilled the duty owed to Hurd by allowing Hurd to exit in a reasonably safe place - the shoulder of the highway.Â  Because I believe the majorityâ€™s holding heightens the duty of care owed by common carriers to a level beyond reasonable care, I would reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision and hold that the Transit Authority was entitled to a directed verdict.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the dissent that the Transit Authority was entitled to a directed verdict, as there was no evidence that the shoulder of the road was an unreasonable place to let Hurd exit the bus.\r\n\r\n[1] The logic of the dissent is inescapable, however, our duty is\r\nguided by a standard requiring submission to the fact-finder of contested issues of fact.Â  Whether the shoulder of the road was a reasonably safe place for the discharge of passengers was a contested issue the jury resolved against Transit Authority. \r\n[2]Â  It is undisputed that the shoulder of the road was a reasonably safe place.Â  In fact, on cross-examination of Hurdâ€™s expert, the following exchange took place:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n        &nbsp;[W]hen the bus driver discharged Mr. Hurd along the roadside in the shoulder that at the moment that he got out of the bus and was there along the shoulder he was in a place where it was safe for him to beâ€¦\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         As long as he stood there.Â  Yes.Â  Reasonably safe, sir.Â Â Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nInstead the issue on appeal has been framed to determine whether the existence of a â€œsaferâ€ drop off area, such as a Park and Ride, makes the place the passenger actually exited unsafe.Â  This is simply not the appropriate standard that common carriers are charged to uphold.Â  The majority heightens the duty a common carrier owes to its passengers to a â€œbest choiceâ€ standard, which is inconsistent with the current standard of care for common carriers.Â  I fear that heightening the standard of care for a common carrier could create a nightmare scenario for rural area transit authorities.Â  For example, under the rationale of the majority, a carrier could be found negligent for dropping off a passenger in a reasonably safe place because the carrier did not choose the best place to drop off the passenger, which might be two blocks down the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25960","title":"In the Matter of the Estate of Mary Frances Pallister","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25960","description":"The circuit court affirmed the decision of a probate court jury, which found that Mary Frances Pallister had not revoked her will prior to her death, although the original will was lost or missing.

that Ann Patton, personal representative of the Estate of Ruth Eleanor Diem, proved by clear and convincing evidence Mary Frances Pallister (Testatrix) did not destroy her original last will and testament with an intent to revoke it.[1]Â  The circuit court affirmed the verdict and Appellants, the nephews and niece of Testatrix, appeal.Â  We certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and now affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nTestatrix died April 7, 2001, at the age of 89, leaving an estate with an estimated, after-tax value of $1.4 million.Â  Testatrixâ€™s husband predeceased her and she left no children. \r\nThe parties agreed Testatrix was competent to execute the last will and testament dated October 22, 1999, the will in issue, but litigated the question whether the will was revoked by Testatrix because the original document could not be found after Testatrixâ€™s death.Â  Ruth Eleanor Diem (Diem), the primary beneficiary to the will, was the sister of Testatrixâ€™s husband.Â  Patton, a contingent beneficiary in the will, is Diemâ€™s daughter.Â  James Reames (James) and the other Appellants are the children of Testatrixâ€™s two brothers.Â  \r\nJames is a contingent beneficiary in the will, but will not take under it because Diem survived Testatrix.Â  James and the other Appellants would inherit Testatrixâ€™s estate if the will is deemed destroyed with an intent to revoke, such that intestacy laws apply.\r\nTestatrix executed two wills while living in New Mexico.Â  The primary and contingent beneficiaries named in Testatrixâ€™s 1983 will were her husband, Diem, and Patton.Â  The 1983 will named these same persons as personal representatives in the same order of priority.\r\nThe primary and contingent beneficiaries named in Testatrixâ€™s 1997 will, prepared after her husbandâ€™s death, were Diem, Patton, and Testatrixâ€™s sister-in-law, Lola Reames, wife of Testatrixâ€™s brother and mother of James.Â  The 1997 will named these same persons as personal representatives in the same order of priority. \r\nDiem and Patton lived in California, while Testatrix lived in New Mexico during the last two decades of her life.Â  Testatrix and Diem were close friends for fifty-five years, staying in touch through visits, joint vacations, telephone calls, cards, and letters.Â  Diem was Testatrixâ€™s matron of honor at her 1946 wedding.Â  Patton and Testatrix maintained a similar, close relationship.\r\nTestatrix, who grew up in Bishopville, S.C., moved from New Mexico to South Carolina in 1998.Â  The will in issue was prepared by a South Carolina attorney and executed on October 22, 1999.[2]Â  In this will, Testatrix named as her primary and contingent beneficiaries Diem, Patton, and James, a Florence resident.Â  The 1999 will named these same persons as personal representatives in the same order of priority.Â  Testatrix told her accountant in South Carolina she planned to leave her estate to Diem and Patton, i.e., her husbandâ€™s side of the family, to honor the memory of her husband and his efforts.Â  He was the primary breadwinner and his earnings and investment acumen resulted in an estate which afforded Testatrix a comfortable lifestyle. \r\nAfter moving to South Carolina, Testatrix placed Diem and Patton as joint-signatories on her bank accounts and granted them right of access to her safe deposit box.Â  About a month after executing the 1999 will, Testatrix signed a durable power of attorney naming Diem as her agent, with Patton as alternate agent, in financial and other matters.Â  On the date she executed the 1999 will, Testatrix signed a health care power of attorney naming James as her agent for health care decisions if she were to become mentally incompetent.\r\nTestatrix, by all accounts, was a â€œdelightful,â€ â€œorganizedâ€ woman who knew her own mind and did not hesitate to express her wishes and opinions.Â  The attorney who prepared the 1999 will testified she discussed various types of trusts with Testatrix, but Testatrix desired only a simple will.Â  The attorney delivered the original will to Testatrix and encouraged her to place it in a safe deposit box. \r\nTestatrixâ€™s tax accountant testified Testatrix was an organized, â€œby the booksâ€ person.Â  Administrators at the Methodist Manor, where Testatrix lived, described her, although she had some physical frailties, as â€œorganized,â€ â€œon the ball,â€ â€œvery sharp mentally,â€ and an â€œindependent, private person.â€Â  Diem, Patton, and James offered similar testimony.Â  Such testimony referred to witnessesâ€™ general knowledge of Testatrix during the years they knew her and was not necessarily focused on the last weeks of her\r\nlife.\r\nTestatrix was generous to close relatives.Â  From 1996 to 1999, Testatrix gave, in cash or assets such as stocks and bonds, $183,000 to Patton, $30,000 to Diem, and $104,000 to James.Â  In addition, Testatrix made a business loan of $100,000 to James in 2000, although James apparently considered it a gift, not a loan. \r\nWhile living at the Methodist Manor in Florence, Testatrix gradually developed a close relationship with James and his family.Â  James visited and helped Testatrix at her home at least once or twice a week.Â  Testatrix sometimes had dinner at Jamesâ€™ home.Â  James testified he visited Testatrix at her home or in the hospital every day during the last several weeks of her life as her health worsened, at times spending most or all of the day with her.Â  A nurse assistant, who sat with Testatrix at the hospital on the evening of her death and who did not know the family, testified Testatrix repeatedly asked for James during the final hours of her life.Â  \r\nJames testified he knew where Testatrix kept financial records at her home, including her bank and brokerage accounts, and he sometimes filed financial documents for her.Â  Testatrix kept extensive financial records from years past.Â  James helped Testatrix sort her mail, but did not discard anything without her permission.Â  At trial James initially denied helping Testatrix with her financial or business matters in the final months of her life.Â  When confronted with his conflicting deposition testimony, James testified he wrote checks for Testatrix and sometimes even signed her name.Â  He carried a bag, containing Testatrixâ€™s checkbooks and investment records, for Testatrix while taking her to and from the hospital in the last weeks of her life.\r\nJames testified he had a key to Testatrixâ€™s Methodist Manor apartment â€œfrom day one.â€Â  He also had the keys to her car, which he testified she gave him several months before her death.Â  The record shows, however, the title never had been transferred by Testatrixâ€™s signature.Â  James, a car salesman for thirty-two years, testified that although he was â€œin the used car business . . . I do not do title work.â€\r\nHe further testified Testatrix gave him a copy of the 1999 will some time following its execution.Â  He saw the will a second time two to three months before Testatrixâ€™s death in January or February 2001, lying on a table in her apartment.Â  On that occasion, he picked it up when it fell on the floor with some books and replaced it on the table.Â  He testified he did not know what happened to the original 1999 will and denied discarding or destroying it.Â  \r\nTestatrix was hospitalized with congestive heart failure and related health problems for eight days in March 2001 and from April 5 until her death on April 7, 2001.Â  In the last month of her life, Testatrix and part of her belongings were moved from her independent living unit to an assisted living unit at the Methodist Manor.\r\nOn April 4, 2001, James asked a bank officer to contact Testatrix at her apartment.Â  The bank officer testified she spoke with Testatrix by telephone and, at Testatrixâ€™s direction, prepared forms to add James to Testatrixâ€™s checking and money market accounts on which Diem and Patton already were listed as joint signatories.Â  The bank officer also prepared a form allowing James to enter Testatrixâ€™s safe deposit box. \r\nJames obtained an account transfer form from Testatrixâ€™s brokerage firm on April 4.Â  James asked a brokerage representative to accompany him to the Methodist Manor to assist his aunt in completing the form, but the representative was unable to leave the office.\r\nJames took the bank and brokerage forms to Testatrixâ€™s apartment.Â  He testified Testatrix, who was using an oxygen tank, signed the forms in the presence of a notary public, who was a Methodist Manor employee; an unidentified â€œsitterâ€ who was staying with Testatrix that afternoon; and an unidentified, older woman who was a Manor resident and friend of Testatrixâ€™s.Â  Signing the forms consumed about half an hour.Â  The notary public later testified that only he, Testatrix, and James were in the apartment when the forms were signed during a five-minute period.\r\nJames returned to the bank and brokerage firm the same afternoon.Â  James transferred $80,000 from Testatrixâ€™s joint bank accounts to his individual account.Â  He transferred Testatrixâ€™s brokerage account, worth about $633,000, to his individual brokerage account.[3]  \r\nOn the morning of April 5, 2001, James entered Testatrixâ€™s safe deposit box for the first time.Â  He testified he did so out of â€œcuriosityâ€ and to search for the health care power of attorney form which had been requested by her doctor in order to admit Testatrix to the hospital.Â  James and his wife testified they could not find the form Testatrix had given James because many of their belongings were in storage while they built a new home.Â  James testified he again entered Testatrixâ€™s safe deposit box after her death on April 9, 2001, in the presence of a bank officer, to retrieve vehicle-related documents. \r\nPatton testified she and Diem first learned on April 10, 2001, about Jamesâ€™ transfer of assets to himself and his entries into Testatrixâ€™s safe deposit box.Â  Patton testified she and Diem, following Testatrixâ€™s death, could not find the original 1999 will in Testatrixâ€™s safe deposit box or among her belongings or other financial documents.Â  When they finally spoke to James by telephone after several attempts to reach him since arriving, he told them he had never seen Testatrixâ€™s will.Â  Patton and Diem visited Testatrixâ€™s apartment and found it in an uncharacteristically messy and unkempt state.\r\nTestatrix had kept her previous wills in a safe deposit box.Â  The record is unclear whether Testatrix ever entered her safe deposit box after executing her last will on October 22, 1999.Â  The last date signed by Testatrix on the record of entry form was partially scratched out or written over.Â  A bank officer testified the ambiguous number may be an â€œ8â€ or a â€œ9â€ and appears to show Testatrix last entered the box on â€œ9-13-99,â€ although the date is uncertain. \r\nPatton testified she and Diem found an empty envelope marked â€œLast Will and Testamentâ€ when they entered Testatrixâ€™s safe deposit box on April 10, 2001.Â  The attorney who prepared Testatrixâ€™s 1999 will, however, testified the envelope was not similar to ones she used in such matters.Â  \r\nJames testified he was â€œconcernedâ€ when he first saw the 1999 will and â€œdidnâ€™t understand why it was the way it was when [Testatrix] had charged me with certain other responsibilities.â€Â  The attorney who prepared the will testified James expressed his anger about the will provisions to her in a telephone call shortly after the will had been prepared.Â  James said he was upset the entire estate was left to Diem or Patton, while he was burdened with helping Testatrix with health care and other matters without getting anything from the estate.Â  The attorney testified James accused her, wrongfully, of advising Testatrix to draft such a will.Â  Jamesâ€™ brother, Stephen Reames, testified at his deposition James told him - after he had transferred Testatrixâ€™s assets to himself - James had â€œgot his inheritance from [Testatrix].â€Â  Stephen testified at trial he could not recall whether James used the word â€œgiftâ€ or â€œinheritanceâ€ in describing the transferred assets. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the circuit court err in affirming the juryâ€™s verdict because Patton failed to present clear and convincing evidence rebutting the presumption Testatrix had destroyed her original will, which could not be found after her death, with an intent to revoke it? \r\nII.Â  Did the circuit court err in affirming the probate courtâ€™s refusal to instruct the jury on the principle that a person is never presumed to commit a crime?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to contest a will is an action at law.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 235 S.C. 542, 546, 112 S.E.2d 647, 649 (1960); Golini v. Bolton, 326 S.C. 333, 338, 482 S.E.2d 784, 787 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  If the proceeding in the probate court is in the nature of an action at law, the circuit court and the appellate court may not disturb the probate courtâ€™s findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence to support them.Â  Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 361, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993); Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976); In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 262, 495 S.E.2d 454, 460 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Under the Probate Code, a circuit court hearing an appeal from the probate court must apply the same rules of law as an appellate court would apply on appeal.Â  Matter ofÂ  Howard, 315 S.C. at 360-61, 434 S.E.2d at 256-57; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308 (Supp. 2004).\r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions unless the trial court abused its discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.Â  Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  EVIDENCE SUPPORTING JURYâ€™S VERDICT\r\nAppellants contend the probate and circuit courts erred in denying their directed verdict and post-trial motions for a judgment in their favor as a matter of law.Â  Appellants argue Patton failed to present clear and convincing evidence rebutting the presumption Testatrix had destroyed her will with an intent to revoke it because the original document could not be found after her death.Â  Appellants argue â€œthere is not a scintilla of evidence of a cause, other than revocation, for the Willâ€™s disappearance.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nA will is an expression of a testatorâ€™s intent to dispose of the testatorâ€™s property after death.Â  A will may be freely modified or revoked by a mentally competent testator, acting of the testatorâ€™s own volition, until the testatorâ€™s death.Â  Lowe v. Fickling, 207 S.C. 442, 447, 36 S.E.2d 293, 294 (1945); S.C. Code Ann. 62-2-506 (1987) (revocation of will by writing or act).Â  \r\nâ€œWhen a testator takes possession of his [original] will and the same cannot be found after his death, the law presumes the testator destroyed it animo revocandi, i.e., with an intent to revoke it.Â  This is merely a presumption of fact and may be rebutted by the evidence the will existed at the time of his death, was lost subsequent thereto, or had been destroyed by another without authority to do so.Â  The same presumption arises where it is shown the testator, while not having the will in his actual possession, had ready access to it.â€Â  Lowe, 207 S.C. atÂ  447, 36 S.E.2d at 294-95; Bauskett v. Keitt, 22 S.C. 187, 191 (1885); Golini v. Bolton, 326 S.C. 333, 340, 482 S.E.2d 784, 787-88 (Ct. App. 1997); In re Estate of Mason, 289 S.C. 273, 277, 346 S.E.2d 28, 31 (Ct. App. 1986). \r\nConsequently, the person attempting to rebut the presumption and submit a copy of the lost or missing will to the probate court for administration must present clear and convincing evidence (1) the original will existed at the time of the testatorâ€™s death and (2) the original will was lost after his death or destroyed by a third party without the testatorâ€™s knowledge or consent.Â  Lowe, 207 S.C. at 447,Â  36 S.E.2d at 294-95; Golini, 326 S.C. at 340, 482 S.E.2d at 788; Estate of Mason, 289 S.C. at 277, 346 S.E.2d at 31.\r\nThe person contesting the validity of a will usually bears the burdens of proof and persuasion.Â  Golini, 326 S.C. at 340, 482 S.E.2d at 787; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-407 (Supp. 2004).Â  However, these burdens are reversed in cases of lost or missing wills.Â  The person asserting that an original will was, in fact, valid but mistakenly lost or destroyed by another, bears the burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption the testator destroyed the will with an intent to revoke it.Â  Lowe, 207 S.C. at 451, 36 S.E.2d at 296; Golini, 326 S.C. at 340, 482 S.E.2d at 788. \r\nThe mere fact a person who would benefit from destruction of a will possessed it or had access to it, standing alone, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption the testator himself revoked the will by destroying it.Â  Lowe, 207 S.C. at 448, 36 S.E.2d at 295.Â  However, â€œ[p]roof that a testator, whose will cannot be found after death, entertained a kindly or loving feeling toward the beneficiaries under the Will carries weight and tends toward the conclusion of nonrevocation of the Will by the testator.â€Â  Golini, 326 S.C. at 342, 428 S.E.2d at 788-89.\r\nWe conclude Patton presented clear and convincing evidence from which a jury could determine the original 1999 will existed at the time of Testatrixâ€™s death, and it was either lost after her death or destroyed by a third party without her knowledge or consent.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the juryâ€™s verdict in favor of Patton. \r\nIt is undisputed the 1999 will was valid upon execution.Â  The attorney testified she delivered the original will to Testatrix and James testified he saw it in her apartment two to three months before her death.Â  The primary and first contingent beneficiaries of the will were the same persons Testatrix had named in her wills since 1983 - Diem and Patton.Â  The record contains no evidence Testatrix expressed any desire to change or revoke her will in order not to pass assets to Diem and Patton; nor is there any evidence Testatrix grew unhappy or displeased with them in any way.Â  The record contains clear and convincing evidence upon which the jury may have relied in determining the original will existed at Testatrixâ€™s death.\r\nTestatrix previously had kept her wills in a safe deposit box.Â  She may have placed the 1999 will in her box, although it is unclear due to the ambiguous date on the bankâ€™s record of entry form.Â  Regardless, Testatrix usually was an organized, â€œby the booksâ€ person who regularly maintained files containing current and past financial and investment documents.Â  Some of those documents were transported in a bag to and from the hospital on several occasions in the month preceding her death.Â  Some of her belongings were moved from an independent living unit to an assisted living unit at the Methodist Manor in the last weeks of her life.Â  Diem and Patton found Testatrixâ€™s apartment in an unusually disorganized and unkempt state after her death. \r\nIn addition, Testatrix regularly had consulted professionals - lawyers, accountants, and stock brokers - throughout her life when making important decisions and preparing significant documents.Â  The jury may have reasoned that if Testatrix had wanted to revoke her 1999 will, it is not likely she would have torn it up or discarded it.Â  Instead, it is far more likely she would have consulted the lawyer who had drafted the will to make other arrangements.Â  The record contains clear and convincing evidence upon which the jury may have relied in determining the original 1999 will was misplaced or lost during Testatrixâ€™s final illness and frequent moves.\r\nMoreover, James knew about the will and admitted he was displeased with its terms.Â  He telephoned Testatrixâ€™s attorney to complain about it and accused her of convincing Testatrix to leave everything to Diem and Patton.Â  He had unfettered access to Testatrixâ€™s apartment, knew where she kept financial and investment records, and by his own testimony spent days on end there as Testatrixâ€™s health worsened.Â  He had access to Testatrixâ€™s apartment for eleven days while she was hospitalized shortly before her death.\r\nThe mere fact James, who would benefit financially were the will revoked, had access to Testatrixâ€™s missing will is not, standing alone, sufficient to rebut the presumption Testatrix herself revoked it by destroying it.Â  However, in addition to the evidence of Testatrixâ€™s practice of keeping careful records and consulting professionals, the record reveals more than motive to destroy the will and opportunity to do so by a third party.\r\nJames acted decisively to ensure he received, using the word ascribed to him by his brother, his â€œinheritanceâ€ from Testatrix.Â  James transferred about $713,000 in assets from Decedent to himself on the day she re-entered the hospital - three days before her death - after obtaining her signature on necessary bank and brokerage forms. \r\nJames testified several people were in the room during a half-hour signature session.Â  The notary public testified only he, James, and Testatrix were present during a five-minute period.Â  When questioned by Diem and Patton about the transfers and the location of Testatrixâ€™s original 1999 will after Testatrixâ€™s death, James told them he had never seen the will.Â  The record contains clear and convincing evidence upon which the jury may have relied in determining a third party destroyed the will without Testatrixâ€™s consent or knowledge.\r\nII.Â  JURY INSTRUCTION\r\nAppellants contend the probate court erred in refusing to give the following instruction to the jury:Â  â€œThe law does not presume that a will has been destroyed by another person without the knowledge or consent of the maker, for this would be a crime under the laws of South Carolina and a crime is never presumed.â€Â  Appellants argue the charge, drawn from Lowe, 207 S.C. atÂ  447, 36 S.E.2d at 295, was necessary to ensure the jury understood its verdict could not be based on speculation the will was destroyed by a third person.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe probate court, accepting Testatrixâ€™s arguments against the charge, rejected it because use of the term â€œcrimeâ€ was inflammatory and potentially placed too much weight on one method of rebutting the presumption a missing will was destroyed by the Testatrix with an intent to revoke it. \r\nA trial court must charge the current and correct law.Â  McCourt by McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1995).Â  The law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence at trial.Â  State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993).Â  In reviewing jury charges for error, appellate courts must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999).Â  A jury charge is correct if, when read as a whole, it contains the correct definitions and adequately covers the law.Â  Id. at 495-96, 514 S.E.2d at 574; In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 94, 551 S.E.2d 235, 239 (2001).Â  It is not error for the trial judge to refuse a specific request to charge when the substance of the request is included in the general instructions.Â  Varnadore v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 289 S.C. 155, 160, 345 S.E.2d 711, 715 (1986).\r\nWe conclude the probate court judge properly instructed the jury on the law governing lost wills, the rebuttable presumption a testator destroyed his will with an intent to revoke if it cannot be found after his death, and Pattonâ€™s burden to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.Â Â  When read as a whole, the charge correctly defined and adequately covered the law.Â  Moreover, Appellantsâ€™ specific request to charge was included in the general instructions.Â  The probate court judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing the requested charge. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the decision of the circuit court and thereby affirm the verdict of the probate court jury.Â  Patton may present a copy of Testatrixâ€™s 1999 will to the probate court for administration despite the loss of the original will.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The jury rendered a verdict in favor of Ruth Eleanor Diem, Pattonâ€™s mother, who originally petitioned the probate court to accept the will and appoint her as Testatrixâ€™s personal representative.Â  Diem testified at trial.Â  After Diem died, Patton was substituted in her place as personal representative of Diemâ€™s estate.\r\n[2]Â  The 1999 will contained the usual language revoking all prior wills and codicils.Â  The parties agree the 1999 will was valid upon execution.Â  If Testatrix subsequently revoked the 1999 will, that revocation would not revive a prior will absent clear, cogent, and convincing evidence Testatrix intended to revive the prior will.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-508 (1987).Â  The record contains no such revival evidence, therefore, Testatrixâ€™s estate would be distributed under intestacy laws if the 1999 will was revoked.\r\n[3]Â  The parties tried only the issue of whether the 1999 will had been lost by mistake or destroyed with an intention to revoke it.Â  The jury heard evidence, but did not decide the validity, of Jamesâ€™ transfers of Testatrixâ€™s assets to himself.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
