Edward Bradley, of Moore, Taylor &amp;Thomas, P.A., of West Columbia; Michael L. McCluggage, R. John Street, and Michael A. Kaeding, of Wildman, Harrold, Allen &amp; Dixon LLP, of Chicago, Illinois; for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MOORE:Â  This case involves a dispute over how the American Arbitration Association (AAA) administered the selection of an arbitrator.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nBCS Life Insurance Company and BCS Insurance Company (appellants) brought a lawsuit in an Illinois state court against Strategic Resources, Gerald D. Peterson, Continental Assurance Company, Continental Casualty Company, and CNA Group Life Insurance Company (respondents) after a business deal went astray. Â The Illinois court compelled the parties to arbitrate pursuant to the partiesâ€™ prior written agreement.\r\nThe agreement provided that any dispute would be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators, two to be selected by the parties (party arbitrators) and a third (neutral arbitrator) to be selected by the party arbitrators. Â The party arbitrators were selected but were unable to agree on who would serve as the neutral arbitrator. Â Appellants then declared that the party arbitrators had reached an impasse and sought assistance from the AAA to make the selection.[1]\r\nOnce respondents became aware that appellants sought the AAAâ€™s assistance, a disagreement ensued as to which set of AAA rules was applicable. Â Appellants argued that the AAAâ€™s Supplementary Rules for the Resolution of Intra-Industry United States Reinsurance and Insurance Disputes (Supplementary Rules) applied. Â However, respondents contended that the AAAâ€™s Commercial Rules applied.[2]Â  The AAA issued a list of proposed arbitrators according to the Supplementary Rules and required the parties to â€œstrike and rankâ€ those candidates listed by July 18, 2003.\r\nRespondents objected to the list provided by the AAA and the parties were unable to compromise. Â On July 17, 2003, one day before the â€œstrike and rankâ€ deadline, respondents initiated these proceedings.\r\nThe trial court found that appellants had engaged in a variety of wrongful conduct, including, but not limited to, manipulating the AAA, violating the rules of the AAA, improperly communicating with the AAA, and making inconsistent statements to the trial court at hearings and in documents filed with the court. Â As a result, the trial court enjoined the AAA from following the Supplementary Rules and directed the AAA to devise a list of arbitrators according to the Commercial Rules. Â Appellants appealed. Â This case was certified from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err by enjoining the AAA?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAn order granting or denying an injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Â County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 560 S.E.2d 902 (Ct. App. 2002). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law. Â Id.\r\nThe power of the court to grant an injunction is in equity. Â Doe v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liability Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 347 S.C. 642, 557 S.E.2d 670 (2001).Â  The court will reserve its equitable powers for situations when there is no adequate remedy at law. Â Santee Cooper Resort, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 298 S.C. 179, 379 S.E.2d 119 (1989). Â The party seeking an injunction has the burden of demonstrating facts and circumstances warranting an injunction. Â Calcutt v. Calcutt, 282 S.C. 565, 320 S.E.2d 55 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The remedy of an injunction is a drastic one and ought to be applied with caution.Â  Forest Land Co. v. Black, 216 S.C. 255, 57 S.E.2d 420 (1950).Â  In deciding whether to grant an injunction, the court must balance the benefit of an injunction to the plaintiff against the inconvenience and damage to the defendant, and grant an injunction which seems most consistent with justice and equity under the circumstances of the case.Â  Id.\r\nFor a preliminary injunction to be granted, the plaintiff must establish that (1) it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted; (2) the party seeking injunction will likely succeed in the litigation; and (3) there is an inadequate remedy at law. Â Scratch Golf Co. v. Dunes West Residential Golf Props., Inc., 361 S.C. 117, 603 S.E.2d 905 (2004).\r\nIn its order granting the injunction, the trial court held that respondents should not be required to wait until the arbitration has concluded before challenging the proceedings, because it would be wasteful to arbitrate pursuant to inapplicable rules and with an improperly selected neutral arbitrator.\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred by granting injunctive relief because respondents have an adequate remedy at law according to South Carolina common law.[3] Â We agree.\r\nRespondents are not entitled to an injunction because they have the right to appeal the results of the arbitration, which is an adequate remedy at law.[4]Â  Cf. Scratch Golf Co., supra (injunction inappropriate where golf course failed to establish that it lacked adequate remedy at law to collect damages in breach of contract and negligence suit against developer); Riverwoods, LLC, v. County of Charleston, 349 S.C. 378, 563 S.E.2d 651 (2002) (injunction inappropriate where adequate remedy at law exists).Â  The right to appeal provides respondents with an adequate remedy at law, a protection of their rights, and an opportunity to repair any prejudice caused by the alleged improper selection of the neutral arbitrator. Â Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred by granting the injunction.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the lower court and hold that an injunction was an improper remedy because respondents had an adequate remedy at law.\r\nTherefore, the trial courtâ€™s ruling is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Cordell Maddox, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  After litigation was commenced in Illinois between most parties to this suit, the Illinois courts granted requests to submit the dispute to arbitration and dismissed those actions.Â  When the respondents became dissatisfied with the actions of the appellants and feared the American Arbitration Association (AAA) would utilize a set of rules they felt did not favor them to select the third arbitrator, they filed this matter in South Carolina seeking to enjoin the AAA to utilize their preferred methodology.Â  In response, the appellants filed a request for emergency relief in Illinois.Â  The Illinois court required the AAA to determine the procedure to be used in this matter, and stated, â€œAfter the AAA makes such a ruling, the arbitration shall proceed consistent with the AAAâ€™s ruling.Â  The Court retains jurisdiction over the parties and this dispute.â€Â  The South Carolina circuit court then issued a permanent injunction requiring the AAA to use respondentsâ€™ preferred rules.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nI concurred in the result reached by the majority when this opinion first issued, and I concur in the decision now to reverse the injunction.Â  I write separately, however, because of my concern that the majorityâ€™s opinion may be read to hold that the ability to appeal from final judgment is always an adequate remedy at law such that an injunction will never lie.Â  I do not agree.Â  Further, the posture of this case has a South Carolina circuit court injecting itself into an arbitration proceeding which is under the jurisdiction of the courts of Illinois.Â  As a matter of comity and public policy, I would vacate the injunction and remand with instructions that this case be dismissed.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The trial court found that appellants unilaterally made this request in an attempt to obtain an unfair advantage by having the neutral arbitrator selected from a favorable list of arbitrators.\r\n[2]&nbsp; We assume the parties wanted what they perceived to be the most favorable list of arbitrators. Â The Supplementary Rules, which generally apply to disputes involving insurance claims and coverage, would yield a list of arbitrators who are not lawyers, and who have significant experience as officers of life or health insurance companies. Â On the other hand, the Commercial Rules would yield a list of arbitrators who are lawyers experienced in complex contract disputes.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Respondents contend that, despite South Carolina common law, Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act grants the trial court the authority to enjoin the AAA upon parties reaching an impasse in deciding on an arbitrator.Â  We disagree.Â  The statute specifically limits the scope of the courtâ€™s authority to appoint an arbitrator upon parties reaching an impasse.Â  We need not decide whether the parties ever reached an impasse.Â  Even upon an impasse, the injunction was beyond the scope of authority granted to the trial court by the FAA.\r\n[4]&nbsp; See 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 10, 11, and 12 (sections of the Federal Arbitration Act, which provide that a party in arbitration has the right to appeal at the conclusion of arbitration).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26120","title":"Farnsworth v.

Thomas, all of Rogers, Townsend &amp; Thomas, of Columbia, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES: Â The circuit court ordered Appellant/Respondent Carolyn Farnsworth (Farnsworth) to comply with a settlement agreement between herself and Respondent/Appellant Davis Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. (Davis).Â  Farnsworth appealed, and Davis cross-appealed.[1]Â  We certified the case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We reverse on Farnsworthâ€™s appeal, and affirm on Davisâ€™s appeal.\r\nFACTS\r\nFarnsworth brought an action against Davis for breach of contract and negligence.Â  During discovery, Farnsworthâ€™s attorney sent a letter to Davisâ€™s attorney indicating that Farnsworth would release Davis of all liability if Davis were to pay $22,000 to Farnsworth.Â  There is no dispute that Farnsworth authorized her attorney to offer this settlement. \r\nDavisâ€™s attorney accepted the offer by signing the letter.Â  Soon thereafter, Farnsworth decided that she wanted a trial.Â  She notified Davis that she was rescinding the agreement.Â  Davis thereafter filed a motion to compel Farnsworth to comply with the agreement.Â  The circuit court granted the motion, holding that Rule 43(k), SCRCP, governed the enforcement of agreement, and that the requirements of the rule had been satisfied.Â  Â Â \r\nISSUES\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Whether Rule 43(k), SCRCP, was satisfied.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  II.Â Â Â Â Â  Whether Rule 43(k) applies.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nâ€œRule 43(k) is intended to prevent disputes as to the existence and terms of agreements regarding pending litigation.â€Â  Ashfort Corp. v. Palmetto Constr. Group, Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 493-94, 458 S.E.2d 533, 534 (1995).Â  The rule provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nNo agreement between counsel affecting the\r\nproceedings in an action shall be binding unless\r\nreduced to the form of a consent order or written\r\nstipulation  signed by counsel and entered in the\r\nrecord, or unless made in open court and noted\r\nupon the record. \r\n\r\nRule 43(k), SCRCP (emphasis added).[2]\r\nI.Â  Satisfaction of Rule 43(k)\r\nPrior to filing its motion to compel, Davis admittedly received actual notice that Farnsworth was withdrawing her assent.Â  It was for this reason that Davis filed the motion. Â Rule 43(k) provides that â€œ[n]o agreement ... shall be binding unlessâ€ one of the three conditions listed above is met.Â  In other words, an agreement is non-binding until a condition is satisfied.Â  Until a party is bound, she is entitled to withdraw her assent. Â \r\nHere, Farnsworth rescinded the agreement before Davis filed the motion to compel.Â  As soon as Davis received notice of rescission, the letter signed by counsel ceased representing an agreement.Â  The circuit court, therefore, ordered Farnsworth to comply with an agreement that did not exist.Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Applicability of Rule 43(k)\r\nDavis claims that compliance with Rule 43(k) is not required in this scenario, because Rule 43(k) does not apply to a written settlement agreement that the parties admit was duly executed.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe have held in the past that Rule 43(k) applies to settlement agreements.Â  Ashfort Corp., 318 S.C. at 494, 458 S.E.2d at 534.Â  Davis argues that the rule does not apply here because this agreement is an â€œadmittedâ€ agreement.Â  Davis relies on dictum of this Court and holdings of the Court of Appeals that Rule 43(k) â€œdoes not apply where the agreement is admitted or has been carried into effect.â€Â  Ashfort Corp., 318 S.C. at 494, 458 S.E.2d at 534 n.1 (citing Ex parte Pearson, 79 S.C. 302, 309, 60 S.E. 706, 708 (1908), in which the Court held that Circuit Court Rule 14, the predecessor to Rule 43(k), did not apply to agreements that had been admitted or carried into effect);[3] see also Widewater Square Assocs. v. Opening Break of Am., Inc., 319 S.C. 243, 245, 460 S.E.2d 396, 397 (1995) (referring to the Ashfort dictum); Reed v. Associated Inv. of Edisto Island, Inc., 339 S.C. 148, 152, 528 S.E.2d 94, 96-97 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing the Ashfort dictum as a rule of law); Galloway v. Regis Corp., 325 S.C. 541, 546, 481 S.E.2d 714, 716 (Ct. App. 1997) (same).Â  The Ashfort dictum does not comport with the language of Rule 43(k).\r\nThe rule is plainly worded: â€œNo agreement ... shall be binding unlessâ€ one of the three requirements is met.Â  â€œUnder our general rules of construction, the words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.â€Â  State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 268, 559 S.E.2d 847, 849 (2003).Â  â€œIn interpreting the meaning of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court applies the same rules of construction used to interpret statutes.â€Â  Maxwell v. Genez, 356 S.C. 617, 620, 591 S.E.2d 26, 27 (2003).Â  Because Rule 43(k) plainly applies to all settlement agreements signed by counsel, we find no merit in Davisâ€™s argument that the rule does not apply in this case. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nOn Farnsworthâ€™s appeal, we reverse.Â  On Davisâ€™s appeal, we affirm.Â  The case is remanded to the circuit court for trial.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, J., and Acting Justices Clyde N. Davis, Jr., and Donna S. Strom, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The cross-appeal is the product of this caseâ€™s unusual procedural path, which we need not address to resolve the issues before us.Â  Both appeals involve the two issues addressed below. \r\n[2] The rule was amended in 2003, with a sentence added at the end: â€œSettlement agreements shall be handled in accordance with Rule 41.1, SCRCP.â€Â  This amendment is irrelevant to the issues before us.\r\n[3] Circuit Court Rule 14 provided:\r\n\r\nNo agreement or consent between parties, or their\r\n attorneys, in respect to the proceedings in a cause,\r\n shall be binding, unless the same shall have been\r\n reduced to the form of an order by consent and\r\n entered; or unless the evidence shall be in writing,\r\n subscribed by the party against whom shall be\r\n alleged, or by his attorney or counsel; or unless\r\n made in open court and noted by the presiding\r\n judge or the stenographer on his minutes by the\r\n direction of the presiding judge.\r\n\r\nUnder this rule, Davis and Farnsworthâ€™s agreement would be enforceable simply because it is in writing.Â  Unlike Rule 43(k), Circuit Court Rule 14 did not contain the additional requirement that written agreements be entered into the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26122","title":"Wilson v.

Â In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Hamilton v. Miller, 301 S.C. 45, 47, 389 S.E.2d 652, 653 (1990). Â Even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Â Id.\r\nDamages\r\nThe Homeowners concede that they have not suffered any personal injuries or physical damage to their homes.Â  However, they contend they have suffered an economic loss by purchasing a defective product.[1] They allege they purchased a faulty anchor system which does not adequately secure their homes.Â  The pivotal issue in this case is whether the Homeowners must prove an actual injury to person or property to bring their warranty and fraudulent concealment claims.[2] Â \r\nArguably, a few cases support the Homeownersâ€™ position that the loss of the benefit of the bargain is sufficient damage in a warranty action. Coghlan v. Wellcraft Marine Corp., 240 F.3d 449 (5th Cir.2001) (holding damage was loss of &quot;benefit of the bargainâ€); Microsoft Corp. v. Manning, 914 S.W.2d 602 (Tex. App. 1995) (holding buyer of defective software program has warranty action even if he never suffers data loss as a result of the defect because buyer did not get what he bargained for). Â Â However, the no-injury approach to product litigation has been rejected in most decisions. See, e.g. Briehl v. General Motors Corp., 172 F.3d 623 (8th Cir. 1999).Â  In Briehl, the plaintiffs brought a class action fraud lawsuit based on an allegedly defective anti-lock brake system (ABS) in vehicles manufactured by General Motors.Â  The plaintiffs did not allege that the brake system had ever malfunctioned or failed. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that &quot;[t]he Plaintiff's conclusory assertions that they, as a class, have experienced damages . . . are simply too speculative to allow this case to go forward. The Plaintiffs' assertions that their ABS-equipped vehicles are defective and that they have suffered a loss in resale value as a result of the defect is insufficient as a matter of law to plead a claim under any theory the plaintiffs have advanced.&quot; Id. at 629.Â Â  See also e.g. Jarman v. United Industries Corp., 98 F.Supp.2d 757 (S.D. Miss. 2000) (dismissing fraud, warranty, and various statutory claims for purchase of allegedly ineffective pesticide where there is no allegation of actual product failure); Weaver v. Chrysler Corp., 172 F.R.D. 96 (S.D.N.Y.1997)(dismissing class-action fraud and warranty lawsuit for allegedly defective integrated child seats where there is no allegation that the product has malfunctioned or the defect manifested itself); Yost v. General Motors Corp., 651 F.Supp. 656 (D.N.J. 1986)(dismissing fraud and warranty claims for alleged engine defect where engine has not malfunctioned and plaintiff alleges diminished value only).\r\nIn most of these cases, the defective products the plaintiffs had purchased had performed satisfactorily and, therefore, the courts found that the plaintiffs had reaped the benefit of their bargain and could not bring a warranty action.Â  â€œThat is simply another way of saying that the products were, in fact, merchantable, and therefore there was no breach of warranty.â€ Â In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Tires Products Liability Litigation, 155 F.Supp.2d 1069, 1100 (S.D.Ind. 2001).Â  Likewise, here, the anchors are merchantable.Â  The evidence here is that the plaintiffs have received what they bargained for - an anchor system which has been effective in high winds.Â  There is no evidence that the anchor systems have not, to date, been exactly what the Homeowners bargained for.Â Â  In fact, here, several Homeowners testified at their depositions that their mobile homes have weathered hurricanes without any damage.[3]Â  \r\nAdditionally, a few jurisdictions have concluded that the &quot;diminution in value&quot; of a product alone is enough to succeed on a common-law fraud claim.Â  Miller v. William Chevrolet/GEO, Inc., 762 N.E.2d 1 (Ill. App. 2001).Â Â  \r\nHowever, without an injury or a defect, there has been no diminution in value to support the Homeownerâ€™s fraudulent concealment claim.Â  \r\nWe hold the Homeowners need to show that the product delivered was not, in fact, what was promised and they have not shown that.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and respectfully dissent in part.Â  Although my reasoning differs from the majorityâ€™s, I agree that the grant of summary judgment to the Home Defendants should be affirmed with respect to all of Homeownersâ€™ breach-of-warranty claims.Â  Also, but for different reasons, I concur in the majorityâ€™s affirmance of the grant of summary judgment to the Anchor Defendants with respect to Homeownersâ€™ claim for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service.Â  I dissent from the majorityâ€™s affirming the grant of summary judgment to the Anchor Defendants with respect to Homeownersâ€™ claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, and from its affirmance of the grant of summary judgment to both defendants on the fraudulent-concealment claim.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Home Defendants manufactured and sold the mobile homes at issue to retailers, which in turn sold them to Homeowners.Â  In an effort to comply with regulations promulgated pursuant to the National Manufactured Housing Construction Safety Standard Act of 1974,[4] the Home Defendants provided with each home a manual suggesting that the anchor system was a device suitable for stabilizing the home.Â  See 24 C.F.R. Â§ 3280.306(b) (2004).Â  As required by the regulation, the manual included drawings and specifications of the anchor system, as well as installation instructions.Â  The manualâ€™s contents were certified as complying with HUD standards by a Design Approval Primary Inspection Agency (DAPIA), which is a â€œState agency or private organization that has been approved by the Secretary [of HUD] to evaluate and either approve or disapprove manufactured home designs and quality control procedures.â€Â  42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5402(18) (2003).Â  \r\nHomeownersâ€™ claims against the Home Defendants relate to the information about the anchor system provided in the installation manual.Â  Homeownersâ€™ claims against the Anchor Defendants relate to the quality of the anchor system itself.[5]Â  Homeowners have presented evidence of studies, including studies conducted by HUD, indicating that the anchor system does not meet HUD standards and is inadequate under certain wind conditions.Â  Homeowners concede that the anchor system has caused no damage to any person or property, but they argue that they are entitled to damages because they did not receive the benefit of their bargain.Â  Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nANALYSIS\r\nI disagree with the majority that Homeowners must allege and prove physical injury to person or property in order to pursue their breach-of-warranty and fraudulent-concealment claims.Â  This disagreement requires me to address issues not reached in the majority opinion.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nI.Â  Implied Warrant of Merchantability\r\nI cannot concur in the majority opinionâ€™s holding that without a claim of physical injury to person or property, a plaintiff may not successfully pursue a breach-of-warranty claim.Â  While the term â€œproducts liabilityâ€ generally brings to mind liability in tort - negligence and strict liability - the third theory of products liability, breach of warranty, is a contract theory.Â  See James J. White, Reverberations from the Collision of Tort and Warranty, 53 S.C. L. Rev. 1067 (2002) (discussing the prevalent and unfortunate misunderstanding of the difference between tort and contract claims in the field of products liability).Â  If the plaintiff asserts that the defendant is liable in tort for a defective product, then of course the plaintiff must prove physical injury to person or property.Â  There is no doubt, however, that a plaintiff who asserts breach of warranty must prove only that his contractual expectations were not fulfilled.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-714 (2003) (titled, â€œBuyerâ€™s damages for breach in regard to accepted goodsâ€); Gasque v. Eagle Mach. Co., 270 S.C. 499, 502-03, 243 S.E.2d 831, 831-32 (1978) (in a product-liability action involving a claim of breach of warranty under article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.), explaining that a buyer need prove only that the goods delivered by the seller were not as promised).\r\nIn the alternative, the majority opinion finds that even if contract law were applicable, Homeowners in fact received the benefit of their bargain because the anchor system was in fact merchantable.Â  Yet, this finding of merchantability is based on the very fact that the anchor system has caused no physical injury.Â  The majority opinion thereby derogates the principle that goods either conform to the contract upon delivery or they do not.Â  Goods do not become non-conforming only upon causing injury.Â  \r\nIn my opinion, it must be properly determined in the circuit court whether the anchor system sold by the Anchor Defendants was merchantable under South Carolina Code section 36-2-314.[6]Â  If it was not, then Homeowners are entitled to relief under section 36-2-714.Â  I would reverse the grant of summary judgment to the Anchor Defendants on the merchantability claim.Â  \r\nConversely, the grant of summary judgment to the Home Defendants on the merchantability claim should be affirmed, but not for the reasons cited by the circuit court.Â  First, as stated above, I disagree that Homeowners must prove physical injury to pursue this claim.Â  Second, I disagree with the circuit court that the Home Defendants cannot be liable for breach of warranty because they did not sell the anchor system.[7]Â  Homeownersâ€™ claim against the Home Defendants is not that the anchor system was unmerchantable, but rather that the mobile homes sold by the Home Defendants[8] were unmerchantable because of the allegedly flawed anchor system.Â  Homeowners emphasize that under HUD regulation 3280.306(b), the Home Defendants could not sell their mobile homes without providing the installation manual discussed above.Â  According to Homeowners, if the anchor system recommended in the manual failed to meet HUD standards, then the mobile home was\r\nunmerchantable.&nbsp; \r\nIn my opinion, Homeowners improperly focus on the manualâ€™s recommendation of this particular stabilizing device.Â  Regardless whether the anchor system fails to meet HUD regulations, is unmerchantable, or both, the important question is whether the mobile homes are fit for their ordinary purpose ... to serve as a dwelling.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-314(2)(c).Â  There is no evidence in the record, and Homeowners do not actually allege, that the mobile homes are unfit for that purpose.Â  \r\nThe only reason that the mobile homes could be unmerchantable on account of the manual would be lack of HUD certification.Â  A HUD approved manual is necessary for any mobile home to be â€œadequately ... labeled as the agreement may require.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-314(2)(e) (another test for merchantability).Â  As mentioned above, the Home Defendantsâ€™ manual was certified by a DAPIA on behalf of HUD.Â  \r\nFor these reasons, I concur in the majorityâ€™s affirming the grant of summary judgment to the Home Defendants on the merchantability claim.\r\nII.Â  Express Warranty\r\nI also concur in the majorityâ€™s affirming the grant of summary judgment on Homeownersâ€™ express-warranty claim against the Home Defendants.Â  Homeowners have failed to preserve their express-warranty claim against the Home Defendants for appellate review.Â  The discussion of express warranty in the circuit courtâ€™s order pertains only to installation of the anchor system, which is not the subject of Homeownersâ€™ claim.Â  Homeownersâ€™ claim is that in the installation manual the Home Defendants expressly warranted the compatability of the mobile homes and the anchor system.Â  Because the circuit courtâ€™s order does not address this issue, Homeowners needed to file a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, asking the circuit court to rule on it.Â  Homeowners failed to file such a motion; therefore, the express-warranty issue is not preserved for review.Â  See United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 356 S.C. 266, 273, 588 S.E.2d 599, 602 (2003) (applying the rule that â€œwhere a trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument raised and appellant makes no Rule 59 motion to obtain a ruling, the appellate court may not address the issueâ€) (from parenthetical to omitted citation).\r\nIII.Â  Implied Warranty of Workmanlike Service \r\nI also agree with the majority that the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment to both defendants on Homeownersâ€™ workmanlike-service claims.Â  The implied warranty of workmanlike service is a service warranty created at common law.Â  See Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d 434, 438 (Tex. 1995).Â  Here, the asserted liability of both defendants relates to their being sellers of goods.Â  Assuming that one or both defendants provided some service, it was incidental to the sale of goods.Â  Any breach-of-warranty claim in this case therefore falls within the specific warranty provisions in article 2 of the U.C.C.Â  See Plantation Shutter Co. v. Ezell, 328 S.C. 475, 478-80, 492 S.E.2d 404, 406-07 (Ct. App. 1997) (discussing and applying the â€œpredominant factorâ€ test for determining whether the U.C.C. or the common law of contracts governs); see also Hitachi Elec. Devices (USA), Inc. v. Platinum Tech., Inc., 366 S.C. 163, ___, 621 S.E.2d 38, 41 (2005) (discussing and applying displacement of the common law when the U.C.C. â€œcomprehensively addressesâ€ a particular subject).Â  \r\nIV.Â  Fraudulent Concealment\r\nUnlike the majority, I would hold that the grant of summary judgment to both defendants on the fraudulent-concealment claim should be reversed.Â  \r\nOn one hand, the majority holds that a plaintiff must prove physical injury to person or property in order to successfully pursue a fraudulent-concealment claim.Â  It has long been the rule, however, that the â€œmeasure of general damages in [a fraudulent-concealment] case, according to the â€˜benefit of the bargainâ€™ rule, is the difference between the actual value of [the property] at the time of the sale and the value that it would have had if the concealed defect had not existed.â€Â  Lawson v. Citizens and S. Natâ€™l Bank of S.C., 255 S.C. 517, 521, 180 S.E.2d 206, 209 (1971); see also Starkey v. Bell, 281 S.C. 308, 313, 315 S.E.2d 153, 156 (Ct. App. 1984) (explaining that South Carolina â€œfollows the majority â€˜benefit of the bargainâ€™ ruleâ€ in â€œan action for fraud and deceitâ€).\r\nOn the other hand, the majority holds that â€œwithout an injury or a defect, there has been no diminution in value to support Homeownerâ€™s [sic] fraudulent concealment claim.â€Â  In so holding, the majority suggests that a buyer receives the benefit of his bargain as long as the item purchased has not yet caused physical injury.Â  This suggestion deviates from traditional analysis.Â  As explained above, physical injury has nothing to do with whether a buyer has received the benefit of his bargain.Â  See Gasque, 270 S.C. at 503, 243 S.E.2d at 832. \r\nWhether Homeowners can prove the elements of their fraudulent-concealment claim has not been determined in the circuit court.Â  The grant of summary judgment on this claim was based solely on the absence of asserted physical injury.Â  The circuit court erred in this regard, and I would reverse the grant of summary judgment to both defendants on this claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nI concur in the majorityâ€™s affirming the grant of summary judgment to the Home Defendants on the following claims: breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; breach of express warranty; and breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service.Â  I also concur in the majorityâ€™s affirming the grant of summary judgment to the Anchor Defendants on the claim for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service.Â  \r\nI disagree with the majorityâ€™s affirmance of the grant of summary judgment to both defendants on the fraudulent-concealment claim, and to the Anchor Defendants on the claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.Â  I would therefore reverse the grants of summary judgment on these claims.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]A defective product causes a purely economic loss when the product causes no personal injuries and damages no property other than the &quot;product itself.&quot; East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., 476 U.S. 858, 870 (1986). \r\n[2]The Homeowners contend the circuit court misconstrued their claims as alleging products liability claims rather than claims for breaches of warranties.Â  We disagree.Â  The circuit court judge specifically noted that under either a tort or products liability theory, the Homeowners must establish an actual injury citing Small v. Pioneer Machinery, Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 494 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n[3]The Homeowners rely on studies conducted over the past twenty-five yearsÂ  which they contend establishes that the anchor systems are flawed and do not adequately secure mobile homes.Â  Many of these studies were conducted by HUD.Â  As the Homeowners contend, the studies have â€œquestioned the effectiveness of the soil anchor system.â€Â  \r\n[4] 42 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 5401-5426 (2003).\r\n[5] The Home Defendants did not sell the anchor system at issue.Â  The Anchor Defendants did.Â  HUD does not require that home manufacturers provide the stabilizing device.Â  24 C.F.R. Â§ 3280.306(a)(2) (2004).\r\n[6] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-314 (2003).\r\n[7] Only a â€œsellerâ€ makes a warranty under article 2 of the U.C.C.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 36-2-313 (express warranty), -314 (implied warranty of merchantability), and -315 (implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose) (2003); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-318 (2003) (effectively abolishing the common-law rule of privity with respect to a â€œsellerâ€™s warrantyâ€).\r\n[8] Homeowners purchased their respective mobile homes from third-party dealers, not the Home Defendants.Â  That is unimportant to Homeownersâ€™ breach-of-warranty claims, however, for lack of privity is no defense to an article 2 breach-of-warranty claim.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-318 (2003).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26123","title":"State v.

Floyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26123Â Â \r\nHeard January 5, 2006 - Filed March 6, 2006 \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n___________\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT: Â Michael James Laney (Appellant) was charged with two counts of murder; two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of or attempted commission of a violent crime; arson to a dwelling; criminal sexual conduct, first degree; and kidnapping. He was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death.Â  We reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn September 25, 2000, Dorothy Hancock and Thelma Godfrey were murdered in Hancockâ€™s home in Greenville County.Â  The victims were neighbors and both in their eighties.Â  Around 9:15 p.m. that night, John Gillard, another neighbor, heard a loud noise.Â  Upon investigation, he saw smoke coming from Hancockâ€™s house and observed Hancockâ€™s garage door had been smashed and her car was missing.Â  He entered the garage and saw Hancockâ€™s body on the floor.Â  Gillardâ€™s wife reported the incident to 911.Â  Responding to the call, a firefighter found Godfreyâ€™s body in a bedroom; her body was tied to a chair with a telephone cord and was covered with tape, a sheet, and a cloth.Â  \r\nDr. Michael Ward, the Greenville County Medical Examiner, performed autopsies on both victims and testified as an expert in forensic pathology.Â  He testified Hancock had several broken ribs, a broken sternum, and had been sexually assaulted.Â  He testified Hancock received three stab wounds including a fatal stab cutting her throat from side to side.Â  Hancockâ€™s cause of death was multiple blunt and sharp forced injuries.Â  \r\nWard testified Godfrey had stab and incise wounds to the neck which included a cut trachea.Â  He determined the incise wounds caused Godfreyâ€™s death.Â  \r\nDavid Tafaoa of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) testified as an expert in arson investigation.Â  He opined the fire in Hancockâ€™s house was intentionally set by someone pouring an ignitable liquid in four different areas of the house.Â  Alex Layton of SLED testified several swatches of carpet from Hancockâ€™s house tested positive for the accelerant gasoline.Â  \r\nOn September 26, 2000, Appellant was arrested in North Carolina as a suspect in the double homicide.Â  Officers testified the coveralls Appellant was wearing at the time of his arrest smelled of gasoline.Â  Hancockâ€™s blood was found on the coveralls and on Appellantâ€™s underwear.Â  Appellantâ€™s blood was under Hancockâ€™s fingernails and his semen was on her body.Â  Appellantâ€™s fingerprints were on a phone base and an end section of cut tape collected from under the bedspread in the room where Godfrey was found.Â  Â  Â Â \r\nDuring the sentencing phase of his trial, Appellant presented mitigating evidence regarding his mental ability and health.Â  Two doctors testified Appellant was not mentally retarded but had mental illnesses.Â  Another doctor testified Appellantâ€™s IQ was between borderline intellectual functioning and mild mental retardation.Â  The State sought the death penalty based on the following statutory aggravating circumstances: (1) the murder was committed while in the commission of a criminal sexual conduct in the first degree; (2) the murder was committed while in the commission of a kidnapping; and (3) two or more persons were murdered by Appellant by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.Â  \r\nAs part of the jury charges during the sentencing proceeding, the trial judge charged the jury to consider the above-referenced statutory aggravating circumstances and the following statutory mitigating circumstances:Â  (1) whether Appellant was under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance; (2) whether Appellant was mentally retarded; (3) whether Appellantâ€™s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law was substantially impaired; and (4) Appellantâ€™s age or mentality.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a) &amp;(b) (2003 &amp; Supp. 2004).Â  After finding Appellant guilty as charged, a jury recommended the death penalty.Â  Appellant was sentenced to death for each of the murders, thirty years imprisonment for criminal sexual conduct, and twenty years imprisonment for arson, to be served consecutively.Â  Appellant was not sentenced for the kidnapping and weapon convictions.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-910 &amp; 16-23-490 (2003).Â  This appeal follows and Appellant seeks a new sentencing proceeding.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err by not charging the jury that a life imprisonment sentence meant life without parole because the State offered evidence of Appellantâ€™s future dangerousness?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n        Do the cases of Atkins v. Virginia and Ring v. Arizona, decided by the United States Supreme Court after Appellantâ€™s trial, require Appellantâ€™s case to be remanded for a new sentencing proceeding before a\r\n          jury?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court lack subject matter jurisdiction to sentence Appellant to death because the murder indictments did not identify any statutory aggravating circumstances necessary to expose Appellant to a punishment of death?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this Court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by factual findings of the trial court unless an abuse of discretion is shown.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Jury Charge\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by failing to charge the jury that a life imprisonment sentence meant life without parole.Â  We agree.\r\nAppellant contends a jury charge that life imprisonment meant life without parole was required under Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187 (1994); Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U.S. 36, 121 S.Ct. 1263 (2001); and Kelly v. South Carolina, 534 U.S. 246, 122 S.Ct. 726 (2002), because the State offered evidence of Appellantâ€™s future dangerousness.Â  The State concedes it submitted evidence supporting Appellantâ€™s future dangerousness during the sentencing phase of the trial.[1]Â  The State further concedes due process required Appellant be given an opportunity to inform the jury of parole ineligibility, but contends the issue is procedurally barred from review.Â  In the alternative, the State argues due process was not violated because Appellantâ€™s counsel told the jury that life imprisonment meant life without parole.\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we find the issue sufficiently preserved for review on appeal.Â  Further we find it unnecessary to address the Stateâ€™s due process argument to resolve this issue.\r\nIn Shafer and Kelly, the United States Supreme Court held that where a defendantâ€™s future dangerousness is at issue in a capital sentencing proceeding, and the only sentencing alternative to death\r\navailable to the jury is life imprisonment without parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility.[2]Â  The Kelly Court specifically noted counselâ€™s arguments in Shafer that the defendant â€œwould die in prisonâ€ or would â€œspend his natural life thereâ€ and the trial judgeâ€™s instructions that â€œlife imprisonment means until the death of the defendantâ€ were insufficient to convey a clear understanding to the jury of Shaferâ€™s parole ineligibility.Â  534 U.S. at 257, 122 S.Ct. at 733-34; see also State v. Stone, 350 S.C. 442, 567 S.E.2d 244 (2002) (reversing and remanding for a new sentencing proceeding where the State submitted evidence of Stoneâ€™s future dangerousness but trial court failed to instruct jury after request by defense counsel that Stone would be ineligible for parole if sentenced to life imprisonment and finding statements by counsel and the court to the jury that Stone would spend the rest of his life in prison did not convey to the jury that Stone would be ineligible for parole as required by Kelly).\r\nIn State v. Shafer, 352 S.C. 191, 202, 573 S.E.2d 796, 801-02 (2002), we stated, â€œgiven the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Kelly, the better practice is for trial judges to give the capital sentencing jury a parole eligibility charge whether it is requested or not.â€[3]Â  Today we conclude where a defendantâ€™s future dangerousness is at issue in a capital sentencing proceeding, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without parole, the trial judge shall charge the jury, whether requested or not, that life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant without the possibility of parole.Â  The trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury that life imprisonment meant until the death of Appellant without the possibility of parole because the State placed Appellantâ€™s future dangerousness in issue during the capital sentencing proceeding.\r\nII. New Sentencing Proceeding under\r\nÂ Atkins v. Virginia and Ring v. Arizona\r\nAppellant argues the intervening cases of Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242 (2002), and Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428 (2002), require his case be remanded for a new sentencing proceeding.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellantâ€™s trial began on October 8, 2001, and he was sentenced to death on October 19, 2001.Â  The United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Atkins on June 20, 2002, which held the execution of a mentally retarded person is cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.Â  The Supreme Court left to the states the task of developing methods to enforce this constitutional restriction upon the execution of sentences.Â Â  In Ring, issued on June 24, 2002, the United States Supreme Court held an Arizona statute, which allowed the trial judge to determine the presence or absence of the aggravating factors required by Arizona law for the imposition of the death penalty, violated the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in capital prosecutions.Â  \r\nWe issued Franklin v. Maynard, 356 S.C. 276, 588 S.E.2d 604 (2003), on November 3, 2003. In Franklin, we addressed the following issues: (1) the definition of mental retardation; (2) the procedure for making the mental retardation determination in post-Atkins cases; and (3) the procedure for making the mental retardation determination in cases where the defendant was sentenced to death prior to Atkins.Â  For the definition of mental retardation, we referred to the definition established by the legislature in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(10).Â  Under Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(10) mental retardation is a statutory mitigating circumstance and is defined as: â€œsignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period.â€ \r\nIn Franklin, we concluded that in post-Atkins cases the mental retardation determination is a two-step process.Â  First, the trial judge shall make the mental retardation determination in a pretrial hearing, if so requested by the defendant or the prosecution, after hearing evidence, including expert testimony, from both the defendant and the State. The defendant shall have the burden of proving his mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  If, in the pretrial hearing, the trial judge concludes, by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendant to be mentally retarded, the defendant will not be eligible for the death penalty.Â  If, however, the trial judge concludes the defendant is not mentally retarded and the jury finds the defendant guilty of the capital charge, the defendant is not precluded from presenting mitigating evidence of mental retardation existing at the time of the crime. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3- 20(C)(b)(10).Â  If the jury finds this mitigating circumstance, then a death sentence may not be imposed due to the mandate of Atkins.[4]Â  Franklin, 356 S.C. at 278-79, 588 S.E.2d at 605.\r\nAlso in Franklin, we found where the defendant was sentenced to death prior to Atkins, statutory procedures were already in place.Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-20(a) and -160 (2003), a death row inmate who claims he is mentally retarded and, as a result, not subject to the death penalty, may institute post-conviction relief (PCR) proceedings because his sentence is in violation of the Constitution and exceeds the maximum authorized by law. The PCR applicant must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, he is mentally retarded, and if mental retardation is proven, the PCR court will vacate the death sentence and impose a life sentence.\r\nAppellant argues this Court should modify the procedure set forth in Franklin for post-Atkins cases because mental retardation is a factual issue which must be determined prior to imposing the death penalty, similar to an aggravating circumstance, and under Ring that fact must be found by a jury.Â  In Ring, the Supreme Court stated that â€œ[c]apital defendants . . . are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in their maximum punishment.â€Â  536 U.S. at 589, 122 S.Ct. at 2432 (emphasis added).Â  The Supreme Court noted that â€œ[i]f a State makes an increase in a defendantâ€™s authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact . . . must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.â€ Id. at 602, 122 S.Ct. at 2439; see also Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63 (2000) (â€œOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\r\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.â€).Â  \r\nAppellant has confused the issues of eligibility for the death penalty and a fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in a defendantâ€™s maximum punishment. The General Assembly has not conditioned an increase in a defendantâ€™s maximum punishment on the fact the defendant is not mentally retarded.Â  The fact a defendant is not mentally retarded is not an aggravating circumstance that increases a defendantâ€™s punishment; rather, the issue is one of eligibility for the sentence imposed by a jury.Â  See People v. Smith, 751 N.Y.S.2d 356 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2002) (rejecting argument prosecution is required by Atkins and Ring to affirmatively prove defendant is not mentally retarded at sentencing phase of capital murder trial); State v. Williams, 831 So.2d 835, 860 n.35 (La. 2002) (â€œThe Supreme Court would unquestionably look askance at a suggestion that in Atkins it had acted as a super legislature imposing on all of the states with capital punishment the requirement that they prove as an aggravating circumstance that the defendant has normal intelligence and adaptive function.Â  Atkins explicitly addressed mental retardation as an exemption from capital punishment, not as a fact the absence of which operates â€˜as the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense.â€™â€); Head v. Hill, 587 S.E.2d 613, 620 (Ga. 2003) (â€œ[T]he absence of mental retardation is not the functional equivalent of an element of an offense such that determining its absence or presence requires a jury trial under Ring.â€); Howell v. State, 151 S.W.3d 450, 464-65 (Tenn. 2004) (absence of mental retardation not an element of the offense and not required to be proven by the State nor found by a jury).[5]\r\nPrior to and during Appellantâ€™s trial, mental retardation was a mitigating circumstance.Â  In Atkins, the Supreme Court determined that mental retardation should be considered apart from mitigating circumstances.Â  We conclude in post-Atkins cases, mental retardation is a threshold issue, decided by the trial judge as a matter of law in a pretrial hearing, that determines whether a defendant is eligible for capital punishment at all, and if not found as a threshold issue, mental retardation continues to be a mitigating circumstance under statutory law. \r\nIII. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nAppellant contends the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence him to death because the indictments for murder did not allege any aggravating circumstance which exposed him to the death penalty. Â Appellant asserts the Sixth Amendment of United States Constitution; Ring; Apprendi; and Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (1999), require indictments in state capital murder cases to allege aggravating circumstances.Â  Â We disagree. \r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 498 (2005).Â  Issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.Â  The indictment is a notice document, and a challenge to the indictment on the ground of insufficiency must be made before the jury is sworn. Â Id. at 102, 610 S.E.2d at 500.Â  \r\nWe note the State, as required by statute, timely notified Appellant of its intention to seek the death penalty and identified the aggravating circumstances and related evidence the State intended to use at trial.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(B) and 16-3-26 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2004) (Notice of intention to seek the death penalty must be given at least thirty days prior to trial.). Â \r\nThis Court has recently addressed the issue of whether aggravating circumstances are elements of the offense of murder.Â  In State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 147-48, 604 S.E.2d 377, 380-81 (2004), this Court stated:\r\n\r\nThe [Supreme] Court expressly noted in both Apprendi and Ring\r\nthat the cases did not involve challenges to state indictments. . . . More important, the Fourteenth Amendment has not been\r\nconstrued to incorporate the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s Presentment or Indictment Clause. . . . State law governs indictments for\r\nstate-law crimes.Â  Under South Carolina law, aggravating circumstances need not be alleged in an indictment for\r\nmurder. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-30 (2003). . . .The aggravating circumstances listed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a) (2003)\r\nare sentencing factors, not elements of murder.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n(internal citations omitted). See also State v. Crisp, 362 S.C. 412, 419-20, 608 S.E.2d 429, 433-34 (2005) (under South Carolina law, aggravating circumstances need not be alleged in murder indictment); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 135, 144, 607 S.E.2d 57, 61 (2004), cert. denied, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 125 S.Ct. 2942 (2005) (same). Accordingly, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction in Appellantâ€™s case. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we reverse Appellantâ€™s death sentence and remand this matter to the circuit court for a new sentencing proceeding consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n TOAL, C.J.,Â  MOORE, J., and Acting Justice Ralph King Anderson, Jr., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur, but write separately, because while I agree that the circuit court had subject-matter jurisdiction, and while I further agree that Appellant is entitled to a new sentencing proceeding because of the erroneous jury charge, I would not reach the issue of entitlement to a new sentencing under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002).Â  I nonetheless wish to elucidate my understanding of Franklin v. Maynard, 356 S.C. 276, 588 S.E.2d 604 (2003), to the extent that it differs from that expressed by the majority.\r\nAs the majority observes, if on remand Appellant argues that he was mentally retarded at the time of the crime, then the circuit court will be required to follow the procedure set forth in Franklin for determining mental retardation in post-Atkins cases.[6]Â  The judge will determine whether Appellant is mentally retarded as a preliminary matter.Â  If the judge determines that Appellant is mentally retarded, then Appellant cannot be sentenced to death.Â  If the judge determines that Appellant is not mentally retarded, then the issue will remain for the jury after the parties present their cases.Â  If the jury determines, in the first instance, that Appellant is mentally retarded, then the death penalty cannot be imposed.Â  Franklin, 356 S.C. at 279, 588 S.E.2d at 606.Â  If the jury determines that Appellant is not mentally retarded, then it will proceed as in any death-penalty case, determining whether aggravating and/or mitigating circumstances exist, and if aggravating circumstances are found, whether to recommend death.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (2003).\r\nMy understanding of Franklin is the jury, post-Atkins, does not consider mental retardation as a â€œmitigating circumstance.â€Â  See Franklin, 356 S.C. at 279, 588 S.E.2d at 606 (holding that â€œ[i]f the jury finds this mitigating circumstance [mental retardation], then a death sentence will not be imposedâ€) (emphasis added).Â  Technically, the juryâ€™s consideration of mental retardation is a threshold matter, as is the trial judgeâ€™s consideration of the issue.Â  If the jury finds that the defendant is mentally retarded, then the juryâ€™s role ends.Â  It does not then consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances, for it has effectively determined that the state cannot seek the death penalty.Â  See Â§ 16-3-20(B).Â  In such a case, the judge must determine whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or to a thirty-year-minimum term.Â  See Â§ 16-3-20(A).\r\nOnly when the jury determines that the defendant is not mentally retarded does it consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances.Â  Then, the jury must consider the state of the defendantâ€™s mental health and determine whether it constitutes a â€œmitigating circumstance.â€Â  See Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6), and (7).Â  Logically, however, the jury cannot consider the defendantâ€™s mental retardation as a mitigating circumstance under section 16-3-20(C)(b)(10), since, as explained above, if the jury believes that the defendant is mentally retarded, then the jury never even reaches issues of aggravation and mitigation.Â  \r\nIn sum, I concur in the majority opinion in all substantive respects.Â  I disagree only with the use of the term â€œmitigating circumstanceâ€ with respect to a juryâ€™s determination in a post-Atkins case whether the defendant is mentally\r\nretarded. \r\n\r\n[1]  The State concedes the following evidence was submitted to support Appellantâ€™s future dangerousness: (1) detention officers forcibly restrained Appellant after a struggle with him; (2) Appellant threatened to kill a detention officer and blow up his house; and (3) detention official testified Appellant had dug around the vents and walls in his cell.Â  See, e.g., Kelly, 534 U.S. at 253, 122 S.Ct. at 731 (â€œevidence of violent behavior in prison can raise a strong implication of â€˜generalized. . .future dangerousnessâ€™â€).Â  \r\n[2]  See also Simmons, 512 U.S. at 178, 114 S.Ct. at 2201 (under South Carolinaâ€™s capital sentencing scheme prior to January 1, 1996, due process entitled the defendant to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility where a defendantâ€™s future dangerousness was at issue).\r\n[3]  Under current statutory law, when requested by the State or the defendant, the judge must charge the jury that life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant without the possibility of parole.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (2003 &amp; Supp. 2004) (effective May 28, 2002).\r\n[4]  The constitutionality of the designation of mental retardation in Section 16-3-20(C)(b)(10) as merely a mitigating circumstance in light of Atkins is not before us and we express no opinion on that issue.Â  What constitutes a mitigating circumstance is a matter for the Legislature.\r\n[5]  In Schriro v. Smith, 126 S.Ct. 7, 2005 WL 2614879 (Oct. 17, 2005), the United States Supreme Court held the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals exceeded its limited authority on habeas review by commanding Arizona courts to conduct a jury trial to resolve a habeas petitionerâ€™s mental retardation claim.Â  The Supreme Court found the â€œNinth Circuit erred in commanding the Arizona courts to conduct a jury trial to resolve Smithâ€™s mental retardation claim.â€Â  Id. at 9.Â  The Court further stated, â€œStates, including Arizona, have responded to [Atkins] by adopting their own measures for adjudicating claims of mental retardation. While those measures might, in their application, be subject to constitutional challenge, Arizona had not even had a chance to apply its chosen procedures when the Ninth Circuit preemptively imposed its jury trial condition.â€Â  Id.Â  Schriro is not dispositive of Appellantâ€™s issue.\r\n[6]  While Appellantâ€™s first sentencing was pre-Atkins, his new sentencing will be post-Atkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26124","title":"Myron Johnson &amp; Building Environmental Services, Inc. v.

DAVIS, JR.:Â  This case involves the scope of a forum selection clause contained in a lease agreement between Myron Johnson and Building Environmental Services (Appellants) and Key Equipment Finance (Key).Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nAppellants entered into a lease agreement with Key to lease a telephone marketing system.Â  The lease contained a provision which included a forum selection clause.Â  The clause read in part:\r\n\r\n  This lease shall in all respects be interpreted and governed by the internal laws of the State of New York.Â  You consent to and agree that personal jurisdiction over you and subject matter jurisdiction over the equipment shall be with courts of the State of New York or the Federal District Court for the Northern District of New York solely at our option with respect to any provision of the lease. . . .\r\n\r\nAppellants received the equipment and began operating the equipment as directed.Â  However, soon after implementing the marketing system, Appellants discovered that the equipment violated the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.Â  Because of the violation of the consumer protection act, Appellants were subject to fines.Â  As a result, Appellants filed suit against Key because Appellants discovered that Key was aware that the equipment was illegal prior to executing the lease.Â  Accordingly, Appellants sued claiming that Key induced them into entering a contract to lease equipment that Key knew to be illegal.\r\nAppellants brought this action alleging breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, a violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, and conspiracy.Â  The trial judge granted Keyâ€™s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  The trial judge found the forum selection clause to be controlling and the clause prevented Appellants from filing suit in South Carolina.Â  Appellants filed an appeal in the court of appeals and the case was certified to this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  The following issues are before this Court for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in dismissing Appellants&rsquo; claim because the forum selection clause does not encompass causes of action that arose prior to the signing of the lease agreement?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in failing to find that notwithstanding a forum selection clause, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-7-120 allows for personal jurisdiction of a party in South Carolina?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope of Forum Selection Clause\r\nAppellants argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim because the forum selection clause does not encompass causes of action that arose prior to the signing of the lease agreement or those claims that were the product of misrepresentations prior to the lease agreement.Â  We agree.\r\nThe issue of whether a forum selection clause applies to causes of action alleging that a plaintiff was induced to enter into a contract or lease by the misrepresentations of the defendant is a question of first impression for this Court.Â  Generally, when wrongs arise inducing a party to execute a contract and not directly from the breach of that contract, the remedies and limitations specified by the contract do not apply.Â  Sterling Financial Inv. Group, Inc. v. Hammer, 393 F.3d 1223, 1225 (11th Cir. 2004); Maltz v. Union Carbide Chemicals &amp; Plastics Co., Inc., 992 F.Supp. 286, 297 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); Busse v. Pacific Cattle Feeding Fund #1, Ltd., 896 S.W.2d 807, 812-13 (Tex. Ct. App. 1995).Â  Further, the above-cited line of cases is consistent with South Carolinaâ€™s general disfavoring of forum selection clauses.Â  See Ins. Products Marketing, Inc. v. Indianapolis Life Ins. Co., 176 F.Supp.2d 544, 550 (D.S.C. 2001) (analyzing South Carolinaâ€™s general disfavor for forum selection clauses). \r\nIn the present case, Appellants have alleged several causes of action against Key including conspiracy, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and an alleged violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  All of these actions relate to events that took place prior to the signing of the lease between the parties.Â  We hold that the forum selection clause does not prevent Appellants from filing suit in South Carolina because of the allegations that Key induced Appellants into entering the contract by misrepresenting or hiding pertinent information from Appellants.Â  We believe that it would not make logical sense to allow a forum selection clause to operate to prevent suit in South Carolina where the acts alleged occurred prior to the execution of the contract.\r\nKey argues that the forum selection clause prevents Appellants from filing suit because of the significant nexus between the contract and the events of non-contract claims.Â  See Forrest v. Verizon Communications, Inc., 805 A.2d 1007, 1014 (D.C. 2002) (stating that non-contract claims are subject to the forum selection clause because the events arise out of the same operative facts).Â  However, the events in the present case can be separated because but for the events leading to the signing of the contract, the agreement allegedly would not have been consummated.Â  In addition, the forum selection clause in the present case is narrowly tailored to encompass all events related to the lease, whereas Forrest involved a clause that related to all claims arising between the two parties.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that a forum selection clause that is narrowly tailored to certain activities between the parties does not foreclose the opportunity to file suit in South Carolina where the cause of action relates to acts inducing the execution of the contract.Â  This type of action is entirely distinguishable from a case where the suit is based solely on the breach of the actual contract.Â Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-120\r\nBecause we find that the forum selection clause does not prevent suit in South Carolina we do not address Issue II.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above cited authority, we reverse the decision of the trial court to dismiss the case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) and we remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B.

DAVIS, JR.:Â  This is an appeal from an order directing entry of a Texas judgment against Appellant, American Aire, Inc. (American Aire).Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 22, 2003, the president of American Aire, E. Vernon McCurry, entered into a â€œVMI Equipment, GSM Data Service and Software License Agreementâ€ with Respondent, Minorplanet Systems USA Limited (Minorplanet), a Texas Corporation.Â  The agreement was signed at American Aireâ€™s home office in Hilton Head, South Carolina, and contains the following forum selection clause:\r\n\r\nGOVERNING LAW: CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE: THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS (RULES) OR CHOICE OF LAWS (RULES) THEREOF.Â  CUSTOMER CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE STATE DISTRICT COURT RESIDING IN DALLAS COUNTY, DALLAS, TEXAS (OR IF APPLICABLE THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, DALLAS DIVISION) FOR ALL LITIGATION WHICH MAY BE BROUGHT WITH RESPECT TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE TERMS OF AND THE TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).\r\nOn December 19, 2003, Minorplanet obtained a default judgment against American Aire in the District Court, County of Dallas, Texas, in the amount of $25,660.12, plus prejudgment interest and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In February 2004, Minorplanet filed a Notice of Filing of Foreign Judgment in Beaufort County.Â  American Aire filed a Motion for Relief from judgment, contending it was void for lack of personal jurisdiction. Â The circuit court denied American Aireâ€™s motion for relief, and ordered entry of judgment.Â  Â Â \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err in holding the forum selection clause contained in the partiesâ€™ contract was sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over American Aire?\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW/LAW\r\nAn action to enforce a foreign judgment is an action at law.Â  See Carson v. Vance, 326 S.C. 543, 485 S.E.2d 126 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In an action at law, tried by a judge without a jury, the findings of the trial court must be affirmed if there is any evidence to support them.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).Â Â  \r\nâ€œFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each state to the . . . judicial proceedings of every other State.â€Â  U.S. Const. Art. IV, Â§ 1.Â  In accordance with this mandate, the courts of one state must give such force and effect to a foreign judgment as the judgment would receive in the state where rendered.Â  Hamilton v. Patterson, 236 S.C. 487, 115 S.E.2d 68 (1960).Â  The validity and effect of a foreign judgment must be determined by the laws of the state which rendered the judgment.Â  Hamilton v. Patterson; Security Credit Leasing, Inc. v. Armaly, 339 S.C. 533, 529 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 2000); Purdie v. Smalls, 293 S.C. 216, 220, 359 S.E.2d 306, 308 (Ct. App.1987).Â  A judgment presumes jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the persons, and if it appears on its face to be a record of a court of general jurisdiction, jurisdiction is to be presumed unless disproved by extrinsic evidence, or by the record itself.Â  Taylor v. Taylor, 229 S.C. 92, 97, 91 S.E.2d 876, 879 (1956).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAmerican Aire asserts the forum selection clause is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.Â  We disagree.Â  We find the clause enforceable under Texas law.Â  \r\nTexas courts have recognized that the â€œenforcement of forum-selection clauses is mandatory unless the party opposing enforcement clearly shows that enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.â€ In re Automated Collection Technologies, Inc., 156 S.W.3d 557, 559 (Tex.2004); see also In re AIU Ins. Co., 148 S.W.3d 109, 112 (Tex.2004).[1]Â  Further, under Texas law, a defendant waives any objection to lack of personal jurisdiction by agreeing to a clause naming Texas as the forum.Â  AIU Insurance, 148 S.W. 3d at 112.Â  The party opposing enforcement of the forum-selection clause carries a heavy burden of showing the forum-selection clause should not be enforced.Â  A forum selection clause will be invalidated only (1) if it was the product of fraud or overreaching, (2) if the agreed forum is so inconvenient as to deprive the litigant of his day in court, or (3) if enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which the suit is brought.Â  Tri-State Building Specialties, Inc. v. NCI Building Systems, ___ S.W.3d ___, 2005 WL 2470528 (Tex. App. 2005).\r\nAmerican Aire relies upon three cases which are inapplicable here.Â  First, it cites Loyd &amp; Ringâ€™s Wholesale Nursery, Inc. v. Woodley Landscaping, 315 S.C. 88, 431 S.E.2d 632 (1993), for the proposition that a forum selection clause is, by itself, insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction because, under Florida law, there must be an independent basis and other minimum contacts for a Florida court to exercise jurisdiction.Â  However, this case does not involve Florida law but, rather, Texas law which does allow for jurisdiction based upon a forum selection clause.Â  See In re Automated Collection Technologies, Inc., supra.\r\nAmerican Aire also cites Michiana Easy Livinâ€™ Country Inc. v. Holten, 127 S.W.3d (2003), reversed 168 S.W.3d 777 (2005), as standing for the proposition under Texas law that a forum selection clause is not, in and of itself, sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction and that there must be sufficient independent minimum contacts.Â  Michiana involved a Texas residentâ€™s (Holtenâ€™s) purchase of a motor home from an Indiana Corporation.Â  Holten contacted Michiana in Indiana, and Michiana had the motor home delivered to a third party in Indiana for delivery to Holten in Texas.Â  The sales contract contained a forum selection clause designating Indiana as the forum state over any disputes arising over the sale.Â  Thereafter, Holten instituted suit against Michiana in the Texas courts alleging breach of contract and violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.Â  The trial court held Michiana had sufficient minimum contacts to support jurisdiction in Texas, and that the forum selection clause did not preclude Texas litigation because Michiana could or should have foreseen it might become subject to suit in Texas, i.e., the clause did not necessarily indicate that Michiana had no minimum contacts anywhere else.Â  On appeal, the trial courtâ€™s ruling was reversed.Â  168 S.W.3d 777 (2005).Â  The Supreme Court held Michiana had insufficient minimum contacts to subject it to suit in Texas, and that Holten failed to prove the forum-selection clause was unjust or unreasonable, such that he was bound by it.Â  168 S.W.3d at 793.Â  \r\n Michiana simply does not address the validity of the Indiana forum selection clause or whether, had Holten been sued by Michiana in Indiana, the clause would have been sufficient to subject him to personal jurisdiction of the Indiana courts, which is the issue in this case.Â  Accordingly, we find Michiana inapplicable to the case before us.\r\nLastly, American Aire cites Blair Communications, Inc. v. Survey Equipment Services, Inc., 80 S.W.3d 723 (Tex. App. 2002).Â  In Blair, the Texas Court of Appeals held the non-resident company, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, had insufficient minimum contacts to warrant the Texas courtâ€™s exercise of jurisdiction.Â  There, the Texas corporation, SES, faxed a proposed contract to Blair at its New York office, and thereafter mailed a hard copy of the agreement, which included a forum selection clause designating Texas as the chosen forum.Â  The court held Blairâ€™s contacts with Texas were insufficient to confer jurisdiction; however, the court specifically declined to address the validity of the forum selection clause as it was not asserted by SES as a basis for jurisdiction.Â  80 S.W.3d at 728, n. 4.Â  Accordingly, Blair simply does not resolve the issue before the Court.\r\nWe find that, under Texas law, enforcement of a forum-selection clause is mandatory unless the party opposing enforcement â€œclearly show[s] that enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.â€Â  In re AIU Insurance Co., 156 S.W.3d at 559.Â  As the Texas Court of Appeals recently stated, â€œIf a party signs a contract with a forum selection clause, then that party has either consented to personal jurisdiction or waived the requirements for personal jurisdiction in that forum.â€Â  Tri-State Building Specialties, Inc. v. NCI Building Systems, L.P., 2005 WL 2470528 (Tex. App., 1st Dist). Â Accordingly, under Texas law, it is clear the forum selection clause here was sufficient to establish jurisdiction.Â  Accord Phoenix Network Technologies Ltd. V. Neon Systems, Inc., 177 S.W.3d 605 (Tex. Ct. App. 2005) (recognizing that under Texas law, forum selection clauses are prima facie valid and enforceable).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court properly ruled the forum selection clause here was valid and enforceable.Â Â  Accordingly the judgment below is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Under South Carolina law, a consent to jurisdiction clause is generally presumed valid and enforceable when made at armâ€™s length by sophisticated business entities.Â  Republic Leasing Co., Inc. v.

Gardner (Wife) and James Troy Gardner (Husband).Â  At issue is whether the family court erred in distributing the marital property between the parties.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nHusband and Wife were married in December of 1956.Â  In March of 2001 the couple separated.Â  In April of 2001 Wife filed for separate support and maintenance, alimony, and equitable distribution.Â  In March of 2002, during the litigation, Husband died.Â  As a result, the personal representative of his estate, James Troy Gardner, Jr. (Son), was substituted as a party to this litigation.\r\nIn March of 2004, the family court issued an order in the case identifying, valuing, and distributing the marital property between the parties (60% to Wife and 40% to Husband) pursuant to the family courtâ€™s consideration of the equitable distribution statute.Â  Husband appealed.\r\nThis case was certified by this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  As a result, the following issues are before this Court:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the family court err in valuing and distributing the marital assets between the parties?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the family court err in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Marital Assets\r\nHusband argues that the family court erred in identifying, valuing, and distributing the marital assets.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn making an equitable distribution of marital property, the court must (1) identify the marital property, both real and personal, to be divided between the parties; (2) determine the fair market value of the identified property; (3) apportion the marital estate according to the contributions,\r\nboth direct and indirect, of each party to the acquisition of the property during the marriage, their respective assets and incomes, and any special equities they may have in marital assets; and (4) provide for an equitable division of the marital estate, including the manner in which the distribution is to take place. Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 293, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nIn general, marital property subject to equitable distribution is valued as of the date the marital litigation is filed or commenced.Â  Fields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 186, 536 S.E.2d 684, 686 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, the parties may be entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation in marital assets occurring after separation but before divorce.Â  See Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 228, 512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating that because our family courts handle a large number of cases, there often is a substantial delay between the commencement of an action and its ultimate resolution. Thus, it is not unusual for the value of marital assets to change between the time the action was commenced and its final resolution.)\r\nIn the present case, Husband argues the family court erred in the valuation of several marital assets.Â  Husbandâ€™s retirement account is the asset at the center of this disagreement.Â  While the litigation was pending, Husband died.Â  As a result of Husbandâ€™s death, the retirement account ceased to exist.Â  However, other assets awarded to both Husband and Wife also declined in value during the litigation.Â  Further, Husband failed to offer any evidence of appropriate values for the marital property at the family court level and does not offer any suggestion of value in the brief before this Court.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the date of the filing of the litigation should be used as the date of valuation in the present case.Â  In addition, we hold that a court reviewing a property distribution must look at the appreciation or depreciation of marital assets with regard to the entire martial estate and not the assets individually.\r\nTherefore, we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision using the date of filing to determine the value of the marital assets.Â  Further, we hold that the family court correctly looked at the entire marital estateâ€™s changed value.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  In determining how marital property should be divided, the family court considered all the relevant factors, including the situation of the parties at the time of the divorce, and made the appropriate division of the property.Â  \r\nRegarding the remaining issues, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220, SCACR and the following authority: Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991); Honea v. Honea, 292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d 191, 192 (Ct. App. 1987); and S.C. Code Ann.

Sidney Connor, IV, of Kelaher, Connell &amp; Connor, of Surfside Beach, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision reversing the grant of summary judgment to petitioners in this civil conspiracy case.[1]Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent Linda Angus was hired as county administrator for Horry County in 1996.Â  Her employment was at the will of the countyâ€™s governing body, Horry County Council.Â  County Council terminated Angusâ€™s employment effective June 22, 1999, and paid her severance pursuant to her contract, including her annual salary of $117,888.16 plus accrued vacation leave of $10,145.18.Â  Angus subsequently brought this action for civil conspiracy[2] against County Council, petitioners Myrtle Beach Herald and its publisher Deborah Johnson (hereinafter collectively â€œNewspaperâ€), and petitioners Burroughs &amp; Chapin Co., Doug Wendel and Pat Dowling (hereinafter collectively â€œDeveloperâ€).Â  Angus alleged that because she objected to several projects in the county proposed by Developer, these parties conspired to have her terminated.Â  The alleged conspiracy included incentives to County Council members and the publication of articles discrediting Angus.Â  \r\nAll the defendants moved for summary judgment.Â  The trial judge granted summary judgment on the ground that the termination of at-will employment cannot support a cause of action for civil conspiracy, citing Ross v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia, 273 S.C. 764, 259 S.E.2d 814 (1979). Â Angus appealed.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment as to County Council members based on Ross, but reversed as to Newspaper and Developer.Â  Â \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Can a public official who is an at-will employee maintain an action for civil conspiracy?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more parties joined for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, thereby causing her special damages. Â Lawson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 340 S.C. 346, 532 S.E.2d 259 (2000); Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996).Â  Under Ross, an at-will employee may not maintain a civil conspiracy action against her employer.Â  Where the employment is at-will, the employee may be terminated â€œat any time for any reason or for no reason at all.â€ Â 259 S.C. at 765, 259 S.E.2d at 814.Â  Applying Ross, the Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment to County Council as Angusâ€™s employer but concluded Ross was not applicable to Newspaper and Developer because they were third parties to the employment agreement.Â  It held Angus could therefore maintain a civil conspiracy action against them.\r\nWe disagree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis and find Ross controlling.Â  The critical factor here is Angusâ€™s status as an at-will public official.[3]Â  In our democratic society, a public official is answerable to the public; members of the public are not third-party interlopers.Â  Because of Angusâ€™s status as a public official, we conclude her action for civil conspiracy cannot be maintained against any of these defendants.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ decision overturning the grant of summary judgment to Newspaper and Developer is therefore\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Brooks P. Goldsmith, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Angus v. Burroughs &amp; Chapin, 358 S.C. 498, 596 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Â \r\n[2] Her causes of action for tortious interference with contract, defamation, and unfair trade practices were dismissed. \r\n[3] Horry County operates under the council-administrator form of government pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-610 (1986).Â  See Eargle v. Horry County, 344 S.C. 449, 545 S.E.2d 276 (2001).Â  Under Â§ 4-9-620, the county administrator is the administrative head of county government. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26128","title":"Peagler v.

Therefore, the vehicleâ€™s insurance policy did not provide coverage for the injury.","date":"2006-03-20","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nBENCH MEMORANDUM\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{text-indent:36.0pt;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tvertical-align:super;}\r\n.documentbody1\r\n\t{font-family:Verdana;}\r\n.documentbody\r\n\t{}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        David Peagler, as personal representative of the Estate of Kathy Marie Thompson, Plaintiff-Appellee,\r\n        v.\r\n        USAA Insurance Company, Defendant-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nON CERTIFICATION FROM THE UNITED STATES\r\nCOURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\r\nClyde H.

Thompson (Decedent), filed a declaratory judgment action against USAA Insurance Co. (Insurer), seeking a declaration that an automobile insurance policy provided coverage for the accident which occurred in this case.Â  Insurer removed the case from state court to federal district court. Â From the decision of the district court, Insurer effected an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.Â  The facts, as stipulated by the parties, are drawn from the Court of Appealâ€™s certification order.Â Â  \r\nDecedent was fatally injured on August 31, 2001, when her husband, Gregory A. Thompson (Thompson), was unloading two shotguns from the pickup truck Decedent was occupying.Â  On that morning, Decedent and the coupleâ€™s two sons, ages nine and fourteen, were preparing to depart from home to go to work and school.Â  The automobile customarily driven by Decedent failed to start.Â  Decedent and the boys planned to take Thompsonâ€™s vehicle, a Ford F-150 4x4 super cab pickup truck.\r\nDecedent entered the pickup truck, closed the door, started the engine, and wrapped the seatbelt around her.Â  The older son got in the front passenger seat, closed the door, and fastened his seatbelt.Â  When the younger son opened the rear driver-side door to enter the truck, he saw two cased shotguns lying on the rear seat, with the barrels facing toward him.Â  Decedent instructed him to go in the house and ask Thompson to come remove the shotguns.\r\nThompson opened the rear passenger-side door to enter the cab area.Â  He lifted the shotguns off the rear seat and placed the barrel of the guns pointing toward the floor, with the butt ends pointing toward the truckâ€™s rear window.Â  Thompson then helped his younger son load his bookbag and buckle his seatbelt.Â  As Thompson picked up the shotguns and began to exit the vehicle, one of the shotguns discharged, striking Decedent.Â  She died within seconds as a result of wounds received from the accidental discharge of the shotgun.\r\nOn the day before the accident, Thompson and the older son had placed the two shotguns into the truck and traveled to a hunting area to scout deer and practice shooting in preparation for the upcoming hunting season.Â  Thompson and the older son returned the shotguns back to their cases and placed them on the rear seat to return home.Â  The guns remained there during a ride of about forty miles over dirt and paved roads.Â  Both shotguns were believed to be unloaded, however, one of them was not and that gunâ€™s safety was not engaged. \r\nThe parties further stipulate that the fact the truckâ€™s engine was running did not cause or contribute to the discharge of the shotgun; that Insurer did not specifically know Thompson was a hunter, but understood and foresaw that pickup trucks are frequently used in hunting; that the terms â€œtransportation,â€ â€œoperation,â€ and â€œuse of vehicleâ€ are not defined in the insurance policy; and that the term â€œoccupyingâ€ is defined in the policy as â€œin, on, getting into or out of.â€\r\nAfter entering into a stipulation of facts, both parties filed motions for summary judgment on whether the policy provided coverage under the facts of this case.Â  The federal district court granted Plaintiffâ€™s motion, finding that coverage existed, and denied Insurerâ€™s motion.Â  Peagler v. USAA Ins. Co., 325 F. Supp. 2d 620 (D.S.C. 2004). Â Insurer appealed to the Fourth Circuit, which has certified the following question to this Court:\r\n\r\n  Did Decedentâ€™s fatal injury arise out of the â€œownership, maintenance, or useâ€ of a motor vehicle pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (2002), such that the vehicleâ€™s insurance policy provides coverage for the accidental discharge of a shotgun which occurred during the unloading of firearms from a stationary, occupied vehicle which had been used for hunting purposes the previous day?[1]\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn answering a certified question raising a novel question of law, the Court is free to decide the question based on its assessment of which answer and reasoning would best comport with the law and public policies of this state and the Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and right.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2004)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same); Antley v. New York Life Ins. Co., 139 S.C. 23, 30, 137 S.E. 199, 201 (1927) (â€œIn [a] state of conflict between the decisions, it is up to the court to â€˜choose ye this day whom ye will serveâ€™; and, in the duty of this decision, the court has the right to determine which doctrine best appeals to its sense of law, justice, and right.â€).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nInsurer argues no coverage exists in this case because its policy does not define â€œloading and unloadingâ€ to be within the definition of â€œuseâ€ of the insured vehicle.Â  Insurer contends it would constitute an erroneous and improper â€œrewritingâ€ of the liability policy to include loading and unloading as covered uses.Â  Insurer further argues that coverage does not exist under the analysis previously set forth by this Court in State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Aytes, 332 S.C. 30, 503 S.E.2d 744 (1998).\r\nPlaintiff contends that coverage exists in this case based on South Carolina and foreign authority which demonstrate that the loading and unloading of an insured vehicle are covered â€œusesâ€ under the circumstances of this case, and further asserts that coverage properly exists under the Aytes analysis.\r\nAs an initial matter, we may easily resolve one argument raised by the parties.Â  Insurer asserts that because â€œuseâ€ is not defined in the insurance policy, this Court would have to â€œrewriteâ€ the policy in order to conclude that the loading and unloading of vehicles is a covered use.Â  \r\nPlaintiff argues this Courtâ€™s precedent teaches that loading and unloading are covered uses when a vehicle is being used in a normal, foreseeable manner.Â  Thus, coverage exists because Thompson was unloading shotguns from a pickup truck used in hunting activities, an expected and foreseeable use of such a vehicle.Â  Plaintiff relies on Home Indemnity Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 252 S.C. 452, 166 S.E.2d 819 (1969) (policy which provided that â€œuse of an automobile includes the loading and unloading thereofâ€ included coverage, under the â€œcomplete operation doctrine,â€ for injury to person struck by truck being moved for purposes of weighing and unloading it); Wrenn &amp; Outlaw, Inc. v. Employerâ€™s Liability Assurance Corp., 246 S.C. 97, 142 S.E.2d 741 (1965) (policy which provided that â€œuse of an automobile includes the loading and unloading thereofâ€ included coverage for injury to customer whose hand was injured when bagboy slammed customerâ€™s car door on it; loading of groceries, which required opening the door, was normal and expected use of the car); and Coletrain v. Coletrain, 238 S.C. 555, 121 S.E.2d 89 (1961) (policy which provided that use of an automobile for the purposes stated includes the loading and unloading included coverage for injury to wife whose hand was injured when husband slammed taxicab door on it).[2]Â  \r\nWe reject both partiesâ€™ reasoning and conclude the present case does not raise an issue of policy revision or interpretation.Â  Unlike the South Carolina cases cited by Plaintiff, the policy in this case is silent on the issue; it simply says nothing about whether loading or unloading a vehicle is a covered use.Â  Therefore, the issue must be resolved based on statutes which mandate coverage for damages arising out of the â€œownership, use, or maintenanceâ€ of a motor vehicle, and cases arising under those statutes which establish a method of resolving the issue.Â  Cf. Hogan v. Home Ins. Co., 260 S.C. 157, 194 S.E.2d 890 (1973) (statute controls when provision in automobile policy excluding coverage conflicts with statute).\r\nTurning to the statute-based question, South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (2002) provides that â€œ[n]o automobile insurance policy may be issued or delivered in this State to the owner of a motor vehicle or may be issued or delivered by an insurer licensed in this State upon any motor vehicle then principally garaged or principally used in this State, unless it contains a provision insuring the persons defined as insured against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of these motor vehicles. . . .â€Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(10.5) (2002) (â€œâ€˜policy of automobile insuranceâ€™ or â€˜policyâ€™ means a policy or contract for bodily injury or property damage liability insurance issued or delivered in this State covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle . . .â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-142 (2002) (tracking the â€œownership, maintenance, or useâ€ language of Section 38-77-140 in requiring certain provisions in automobile insurance policies); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-141 (2002) (requiring notice to policyholder of increased premium for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage â€œto protect you against liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the motor vehicles covered by this policy,â€ unless otherwise rejected by policyholder).\r\nWe enunciated a three-part test in Aytes to determine whether an injury arises out of the â€œownership, maintenance, or useâ€ of a motor vehicle.Â  The party seeking coverage must show (1) a causal connection exists between the vehicle and the injury, (2) no act of independent significance breaks the causal link between the vehicle and the injury, and (3) the vehicle was being used for transportation purposes at the time of the injury.Â  Aytes, 332 S.C. at 33, 503 S.E.2d atÂ  745.Â  To date, this issue has been addressed by our appellate courts primarily in the context of various types of assault involving intentional conduct by an assailant; it has not been addressed in the context of an accident involving unintentional conduct, with one exception.[3] \r\nIn analyzing whether an injury arose out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a vehicle, â€œno distinction is made as to whether the injury resulted from a negligent, reckless, or intentional act.â€ Â Home Ins. Co. v. Towe, 314 S.C. 105, 107, 441 S.E.2d 825, 827 (1994); Wright v. North Area Taxi, Inc., 337 S.C. 419, 424, 523 S.E.2d 472, 474 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The three-part test in Aytes applies regardless of whether the injury occurred as a result of an intentional assault or an accident.Â  The focus is on the extent of the role, if any, the vehicle played in causing the injuries or damage, or whether a particular activity is a covered use as required by statute or a policy provision.Â  See also Chapman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565, 211 S.E.2d 876 (1975) (when an insured is intentionally injured and the injury from insuredâ€™s viewpoint is unforeseen and not the result of his own misconduct, the general rule is that the injury is accidentally sustained within the meaning of the ordinary accident insurance policy and the insurer is liable therefor in the absence of a policy provision excluding such liability); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Moorer, 330 S.C. 46, 56-59, 496 S.E.2d 875, 881-82 (Ct. App. 1998) (fatal injuries that victim suffered when shot by insured, who was a passenger in non-owned vehicle, resulted from an â€œaccidentâ€ within meaning of insuredâ€™s automobile liability insurance policies, thus liability coverage existed; â€œaccidentâ€ is defined from point of view of victim rather than insured); S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 382 S.E.2d 11 (Ct. App. 1989) (insurer may not exclude coverage of intentional acts from statutorily required policies of insurance coverage).\r\nThe determination of whether coverage exists in this case rises or falls on the analysis of the first Aytes factor.Â  A causal connection between the vehicle and the injury must exist in order for an injury to be covered by an automobile insurance policy.Â  In this context, we have held that causal connection means:Â  (a) the vehicle was an â€œactive accessoryâ€ to the injury; (b) the vehicle was something less than the proximate cause but more than the mere site of the injury; and (c) the injury was foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of the vehicle.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Bookert, 337 S.C. 291, 293, 523 S.E.2d 181, 182 (1999) (citing Aytes).Â  â€œThe required causal connection does not exist when the only connection between an injury and the insured vehicleâ€™s use is the fact that the injured person was an occupant of the vehicle when the shooting occurred.â€Â  Aytes, 332 S.C. at 33, 503 S.E.2d at 746.Â  \r\nIn Bookert, we found no causal connection between the vehicle and the injury when a soldier fired gunshots from a vehicle which was moving forward while in the traffic lane at a fast food restaurant, injuring a pedestrian.Â  The assault was not foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of an automobile.Â  Bookert, 337 S.C. at 293, 523 S.E.2d at 182. Â Â Similarly, in Aytes, an assailant used a car to transport the victim to a location with the expressed intent of killing the victim.Â  The assailant got out of the car, took from the victim a handgun she had retrieved from the carâ€™s glove compartment and shot at the victim as she sat in the car, injuring her.Â  We held, in part, the assault was not covered by the insurance policy because the parked car was not an â€œactive accessoryâ€ in the shooting; it was merely the site of the injury.Â  Aytes, 332 S.C. at 33-35, 503 S.E.2d at 746.\r\nOur appellate courts have found no causal connection between the vehicle and the injury in similar assault cases.Â  See Doe v. S.C. State Budget and Control Bd., 337 S.C. 294, 523 S.E.2d 457 (1999) (no causal connection between vehicle and injury where police officer forced female motorist to engage in sexual activity in the officerâ€™s parked cruiser and also used the cruiser to drive both to another location to engage in sexual activity; vehicle was not an active accessory in the assault); Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Auto World of Orangeburg, Inc., 334 S.C. 137, 511 S.E.2d 692 (Ct. App. 1999) (no causal connection between vehicle and injury where deaths occurred from gunshots fired by assailant standing outside of parked car; vehicles were not active accessories in the assault); Wright, 337 S.C. 419, 523 S.E.2d 472 (no causal connection between vehicle and injury where taxi driver was fatally shot by two fare-paying passengers; vehicle was not active accessory in the assault, but was merely site of the shooting); Carraway v. Smith, 321 S.C. 23, 467 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 1995) (no causal connection between vehicle and injury where driver of car was injured when bullet fired by bystander on sidewalk shattered his windshield; any causal link was broken by assailant exiting vehicle in front of motorist and conversing on sidewalk with another person for several minutes before shooting occurred); Hite v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 288 S.C. 616, 344 S.E.2d 173 (Ct. App. 1986) (no causal connection between vehicle and injury where insured, an automobile dealership employee, left his idling vehicle and walked fifty feet to instruct another motorist to remain at the dealership because the motorist had backed into a new truck, and motoristâ€™s car struck plaintiff as it left the scene; insuredâ€™s vehicle played no role in the incident); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brown, 779 F.2d 984, 986-89 (4th Cir. 1985) (no causal connection, under South Carolina law, between vehicle and injury when husband, a passenger in a truck, caused the truck driver to collide with his wifeâ€™s vehicle and husband jumped out of truck and shot his wife in her vehicle; court concluded use of truck for transportation to scene of crime was merely incidental and not a causative factor in producing wifeâ€™s death).\r\nThere is a distinction between the above cases and those in which coverage exists because the vehicle was actively used to perpetrate an assault or injury on another person.Â  See Towe, 314 S.C. 105, 441 S.E.2d 825 (finding causal connection between vehicle and injury where victim, who was driving an oncoming tractor, suffered injuries when the steering wheel of his tractor was struck by a bottle thrown by passenger in passing car; car was an active accessory that gave rise to the injury); Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Howser, 309 S.C. 269, 422 S.E.2d 106 (1992) (finding causal connection between vehicle and injury where insured suffered gunshot wounds during vehicular chase by an unknown assailant using an unidentified vehicle).\r\nWe have considered, but decline to follow, precedent in which other courts have found that insurance coverage exists for accidental injuries or deaths which occur during the loading and unloading of a firearm from a vehicle, despite the lack of a policy provision which addressed whether the loading or unloading of a vehicle was a covered use.Â  See Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 521 A.2d 308, 310-11 and n. 1 (Me. 1987) (injury which occurred during unloading of shotgun from insuredâ€™s automobile was covered under automobile policyâ€™s â€œownership, maintenance or useâ€ clause where automobile was being used to transport insured and his companion on hunting trip, a reasonable and foreseeable use of the vehicle; fact that policy did not define â€œuseâ€ in terms of loading or unloading did not affect the analysis); Kohl v. Union Ins. Co., 731 P.2d 134, 135-37 and n.2 (Colo. 1986) (injuries caused by accidental discharge of weapon as motorist removed it from vehicleâ€™s gun rack in order to store it safely for travel arose out of ownership, maintenance, or use of vehicle; motorist was using vehicle in ordinary manner that was not foreign to its inherent purpose and thus injuries were covered under automobile insurance policy); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Truck Ins. Exchange, 216 N.W.2d 205, 210 (Wis. 1974) (injuries caused by accidental discharge of weapon as passenger unloaded the rifle from parked van in order to go hunting were covered by automobile insurance policy; use of vehicle for hunting purposes was a reasonable and expected use, and the loading and unloading of a firearm was a normal incident to such use); Cameron Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ward, 599 S.W.2d 13, 15-16 (Mo. App. 1980) (analyzing distinctions courts have drawn in accidental weapon discharge cases involving vehicles and concluding courts generally have found insurance coverage to exist when the discharge occurs during loading and unloading of vehicles); Shinabarger v. Citizens Mut. Ins. Co., 282 N.W.2d 301, 306 (Mich. App. 1979) (in cases involving accidental discharge of firearms, courts generally have been more liberal in finding a causal connection between use of the vehicle and injury when accident occurs during the loading or unloading process than when accident simply occurs in or near the vehicle, but not during loading).\r\nWe decline to depart from or modify the Aytes analysis in this accidental weapon discharge case.Â  The injury was foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of the pickup truck.Â  Many vehicles in South Carolina, and certainly many pickup trucks, are used for hunting purposes.Â  Using a vehicle to transport firearms to and from hunting grounds is not an abnormal or unanticipated use of a vehicle.Â  However, Plaintiff has not demonstrated the truck was an active accessory to the injury.Â  The truck was not actively used or involved in causing the injury; it was merely the site of the injury.Â  As stated in Aytes, â€œ[t]he required causal connection does not exist when the only connection between an injury and the insured vehicleâ€™s use is the fact that the injured person was an occupant of the vehicle when the shooting occurred.â€Â  Aytes, 332 S.C. at 33, 503 S.E.2d at 746.Â  Plaintiff has failed to show, under the facts as stipulated, that a causal connection exists between the pickup truck and the accidental shooting of Decedent.Â  \r\nOur resolution of the causal connection factor makes it unnecessary to analyze the remaining Aytes factors, i.e., whether an act of independent significance broke the causal link between the vehicle and the injury, and whether the vehicle was being used for transportation purposes at the time of the injury.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe answer â€œnoâ€ to the question certified by the Court of Appeals.Â  Decedentâ€™s fatal injury, under the facts as stipulated, did not arise out of the â€œownership, maintenance, or useâ€ of a motor vehicle pursuant to Section 38-77-140, such that the vehicleâ€™s insurance policy provides coverage for the accidental discharge of a shotgun which occurred during the unloading of firearms from a stationary, occupied vehicle which had been used for hunting purposes the previous day.Â  Plaintiff has not shown that a causal connection exists between the pickup truck and the accidental shooting of Decedent.Â  Consequently, the automobile insurance policy does not provide coverage for Decedentâ€™s accidental death.\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\nActing Justices H. Samuel Stilwell and John W. Kittredge, concur.Â  WALLER, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would hold the injury here arose out of the â€œownership, maintenance, and useâ€ of the pickup truck. \r\nUnder the three-prong test set forth by this Court in State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Aytes, 332 S.C. 30, 503 S.E.2d 744 (1998), the party seeking coverage must first establish a causal connection between the vehicle and the injury.Â  Second, there must exist no act of independent significance breaking the causal link.Â  And third, it must be shown that the vehicle was being used for transportation purposes at the time of the accident.Â  State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Aytes, 332 S.C. 30, 503 S.E.2d 744, 745 (1998).Â  \r\nIn my opinion, the unloading of the firearms from the vehicle, in preparation for transportation of the children to school, with the motor running, provides a sufficient causal connection to warrant coverage.Â  See Taliaferro v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., 821 So.2d 976, 979-80 (Ala.2001) (because the principal use of an automobile is transportation--being dependent upon the operations of loading and unloading-- the act of removing a rifle was an inherent use of a pickup truck for purposes of insurance coverage); Kohl v. Union Ins. Co., 731 P.2d 134 (Colo. 1986) (where accident occurred as truck owner lifted rifle out of the jeepâ€™s gun rack in preparation to unload rifle and store it for journey home, ownerâ€™s actions were intimately related to his use of the vehicle as transportation for himself and his rifle); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Truck Ins. Exchange, 216 N.W.2d 205 (Wis. 1974) (loading and unloading of guns from van constitutes â€œuseâ€ of the vehicle in spite of the absence of any specific â€œloading and unloadingâ€ clause from the policy).\r\nOther courts have reached similar conclusions in cases of accidental weapon discharges.Â  See Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 521 A.2d 308, 310-11 and fn. 1 (Me. 1987) (injury which occurred during unloading of shotgun from insuredâ€™s automobile was covered under automobile policyâ€™s â€œownership, maintenance or useâ€ clause where automobile was being used to transport insured and his companion on hunting trip, a reasonable and foreseeable use of the vehicle; fact that policy did not define â€œuseâ€ in terms of loading or unloading did not affect the analysis); Cameron Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ward, 599 S.W.2d 13, 15-16 (Mo. App. 1980) (analyzing distinctions courts have drawn in accidental weapon discharge cases involving vehicles and concluding that courts generally have found insurance coverage to exist when the discharge occurs during loading and unloading of vehicles); Shinabarger v. Citizens Mut. Ins. Co., 282 N.W.2d 301, 306 (Mich. App. 1979) (in cases involving accidental discharge of firearms, courts generally have been more liberal in finding a causal connection between use of the vehicle and injury when accident occurs during the loading or unloading process than when accident simply occurs in or near the vehicle, but not during loading). \r\nFurther, I would hold that no act of independent significance broke the causal link between the vehicle and the injury.Â  There was no intervening cause wholly disassociated from, independent of, or remote from the use of the truck in this case.Â  On the contrary, the injury here occurred due to the insuredâ€™s foreseeable use of unloading his vehicle of the shotguns loaded in the back.Â  Accord Allstate Ins. Co. v. Truck Ins. Exchange, 63 Wis.2d 148, 216 N.W.2d 205 (1974) (coverage provided where a fatal shooting occurred while a loaded weapon was being removed from a truck during a hunting trip).\r\nLastly, I would find the pickup truck was being used for transportation purposes when the injury occurred.Â  Kathy Thompson and her children were sitting in the car, ready to leave home and go to work and school.Â  They were preparing to drive away, and the engine was running.Â  As the District Court in this case noted, under â€œUSAAâ€™s theory coverage conceivably would not extend to injuries sustained under any factual scenario where a vehicle is parked only momentarily or, far worse, where injuries are sustained while a vehicle is stationary at an intersection during the course of travel.â€Â  Peagler v. USAA Ins. Co., 325 F.Supp. 2d 620, 627 (D. S.C. 2004).Â  Clearly, the vehicle here was being used for transportation.Â  \r\nI would hold that the â€œownership, maintenance, or useâ€ of a vehicle includes the loading and unloading of firearms after the vehicle has been used for hunting purposes, a use which is foreseeably identifiable with normal use of the vehicle.Â  Accordingly, I would conclude insurance coverage exists in this case.Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  \r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We have redrafted the question to refine the issue before us.\r\n[2]Â  It is our impression from a review of numerous cases that automobile insurance policies routinely provided the loading or unloading of vehicles was a covered use until perhaps the late 1960s.Â  Many insurance carriers apparently began modifying their standard policy forms to delete this provision, which ultimately resulted in courts relying on statutory requirements or other policy language when deciding whether coverage existed in accidental weapon discharge cases.\r\n[3]Â  See State Farm Mut.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nPaulette Edwards, of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a confidential admonition, public reprimand, or a definite suspension not to exceed two years.Â  We accept the Agreement and impose a two year suspension from the practice of law.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nFor a period beginning in December 2002 and ending in April 2004, while employed by the South Carolina Centers for Equal Justice (SCCEJ), respondent used her office and home computers to access or attempt to access the email accounts of more than forty employees of SCCEJ and at least one member of the SCCEJ Board.Â  Respondent accessed the email accounts using passwords either not voluntarily provided to her or not provided to her for the purpose for which she used them.Â  Respondent was not authorized to access these email accounts either by SCCEJ or by the individual users of the accounts.Â  \r\nRespondent accessed these email accounts nearly every day from December 2002 until April 2004.Â  The purpose of respondentâ€™s unauthorized access of her coworkersâ€™ email accounts was to monitor management activity and anti-union sentiment during a unionizing effort that respondent initiated and supported.Â  In particular, respondent was looking for information related to the budget, to management meeting reports, and to anti-union activities.\r\nRespondent read, downloaded, and disseminated some of the information contained in the email messages accessed during this time period.Â  Respondentâ€™s reading, downloading, and disseminating of this information was not authorized by SCCEJ, the users whose email accounts she accessed, or the original parties to the email messages.\r\nRespondent deleted some of the email messages accessed during this time period.Â  Some of the messages she deleted had not yet been read by the recipients.Â  Respondent was able to discern from viewing the messages which ones had and had not been read.Â  The messages respondent chose to delete contained anti-union information or sentiment.Â  Respondentâ€™s deletion of these email messages was not authorized by SCCEJ, the users whose email accounts she accessed, or the original parties to the email messages.Â  \r\nOn or about March 29, 2004, respondent used her home computer to access the email account of the managing attorney in another office.Â  She did not have authority from either SCCEJ or the managing attorney to access the account.Â  Through that unauthorized access, respondent obtained a copy of an email message to the interim executive director of SCCEJ from outside counsel representing SCCEJ in connection with the union campaign.Â  \r\nRespondent disseminated this email message to individuals working to unionize SCCEJ.Â  Respondent did not tell these individuals how she obtained the email message.Â  At the insistence of those individuals, respondent forwarded the email message to all of the SCCEJ employees who could vote in the union election.Â  At the time she accessed the email message and at the time she disseminated it, respondent knew that the original sender was outside counsel representing SCCEJ in the union matter.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  Â In addition, respondent admits she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\nSCACR: Â Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice).[1] Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose a two year definite suspension from the practice of law.Â  suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.
