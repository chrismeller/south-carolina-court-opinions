An Appellate Panel of the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) unanimously found\r\nthat Appellant failed to meet his burden of proof in establishing a\r\ncompensable mental injury that arose out of an \"unusual or extraordinary\r\ncondition\" of employment for a Spartanburg County deputy sheriff. We\r\naffirm.                FACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      On October 21, 2009, Appellant was on road patrol when he was\r\ndispatched to a residence in Spartanburg following a call involving\r\ndisturbances between neighbors. As he arrived at the scene, he saw a man in\r\nkhaki shorts standing just outside the carport of the residence. He stepped\r\nout of his car and asked the man to approach him to talk. The man refused to\r\ncooperate and exchanged words with Appellant before walking toward\r\nAppellant with an umbrella raised in an \"offensive posture.\" Appellant\r\nissued several commands for the man to drop the umbrella. In response,\r\nAppellant claimed the man threatened to take Appellant's gun and kill him.\r\nAppellant then fired one shot \"center mass\" at the man's chest resulting in his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n     Following this incident, Appellant began to suffer psychological\r\nsymptoms including anxiety and depression and sought treatment at Post\r\nTrauma Resources in Columbia. Based on his psychological symptoms, his\r\npsychiatrist and psychologist concluded that Appellant was unable to work.\r\n\r\n      On March 10, 2010, Appellant filed a Form 50 to claim workers'\r\ncompensation benefits. After a hearing, the Single Commissioner found that\r\nthe October 21, 2009 event was not an unusual or extraordinary condition of\r\nAppellant's work, and Appellant had not suffered a compensable mental\r\ninjury by accident arising out of his employment. The Commissioner noted\r\n\r\n                                      21 \n\r\n\nthat deputies received training on the use of deadly force and that Appellant\r\nadmitted he knew he would sometimes be required to use deadly force in the\r\ncourse and scope of his employment. Appellant then appealed to the\r\nAppellate Panel, which affirmed the Commissioner's Order and denied\r\nAppellant's claim. Appellant filed an appeal and this case is before this Court\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.     ISSUE\r\n\r\n  Whether the shooting and killing of a suspect by a deputy sheriff while\r\n  on duty is an extraordinary and unusual employment condition such that\r\n  mental injuries arising from that incident are compensable under the\r\n  Workers' Compensation Act.\r\n\r\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      The South Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs\r\nappeals from the decisions of an administrative agency. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-\r\n23-380 (Supp. 2011); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134–35, 276 S.E.2d\r\n304, 306 (1981). Under the APA, an appellate court may not substitute its\r\njudgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions\r\nof fact, but it may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(5). If the findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\ndecisions of that agency are \"clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\nprobative and substantial evidence on the whole record,\" a reviewing court\r\nmay reverse or modify. Id. Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of\r\nevidence, nor evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is\r\nevidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable\r\nminds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached. Pratt v.\r\nMorris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).\r\n\r\n                                  ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n     Appellant argues he sustained a compensable mental injury that arose\r\nfrom an extraordinary and unusual condition of employment. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      22 \n\r\n\n       Workers' compensation pays an employee benefits for damages\r\nresulting from personal injury or death by accident arising out of and in the\r\ncourse of the employment. S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-310 (Supp. 2011). In\r\ndetermining whether a work-related injury is compensable, the Workers'\r\nCompensation Act (Act), S.C. Code Ann. §§ 42-1-10 to -19-10 (1976 &\r\nSupp. 2011), is liberally construed toward the end of providing coverage\r\nrather than denying coverage in order to further the beneficial purposes for\r\nwhich it was designed. Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438\r\n(2000) (citation omitted). Any reasonable doubt as to the construction of the\r\nAct will be resolved in favor of coverage. Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack\r\nRabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 22, 416 S.E.2d 639, 641 (1992).\r\n\r\n       Some context regarding the evolution of mental damages in workers'\r\ncompensation will illuminate the framework which necessarily binds this\r\nCourt in resolving this case. As set forth by Professor Larson in his treatise\r\non workers' compensation, work-related injuries fall into three categories: 1)\r\nmental stimulus causing physical injuries (mental-physical injuries), 2)\r\nphysical stimulus causing mental injuries (physical-mental injuries), and 3)\r\nmental stimulus causing mental injuries (mental-mental injuries). Arthur\r\nLarson, Larson's Workers' Compensation Law § 56.06[3] (2011).\r\nHistorically, given the suspicion surrounding mental injuries, courts and\r\nlegislatures refused to award compensation for mental injuries, or if they did,\r\nrequired that covered mental injuries be accompanied by a physical\r\nmanifestation. See id. at § 56.06[1][b]. A majority of states now recognize\r\nthe compensability of purely mental-mental injuries, injuries without\r\naccompanying physical manifestation, although a large number of states,\r\nincluding South Carolina, place heightened restrictions on recovery by\r\nrequiring that the precipitating stressor be unusual and extraordinary\r\ncompared with normal working conditions.1 Id. at § 56.06[3]; Stokes v. First\r\nNat'l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E.2d 248 (1991); Davis v. Workmen's Comp.\r\nAppeal Bd., 751 A.2d 168, 170 (Pa. 2000) (denying workers' compensation to\r\npolice officer suffering from PSTD because encountering traumatic events\r\nwas normal for a police officer).\r\n\r\n1 Larson indicated that at least 29 states now recognize mental-mental\r\ninjuries. Larson, supra, at § 56.06[3].\r\n\r\n                                      23 \n\r\n\n      South Carolina's standard for recovering benefits for mental-mental\r\ninjury is codified in section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina Code, which\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n      (B) Stress, mental injuries, and mental illness arising out of and\r\n      in the course of employment unaccompanied by physical injury\r\n      and resulting in mental illness or injury are not considered a\r\n      personal injury unless the employee establishes, by a\r\n      preponderance of the evidence:\r\n\r\n      (1) that the employee's employment conditions causing the stress,\r\n      mental injury, or mental illness were extraordinary and unusual\r\n      in comparison to the normal conditions of the particular\r\n      employment; and\r\n\r\n      (2) the medical causation between the stress, mental injury, or\r\n      mental illness, and the stressful employment conditions by\r\n      medical evidence.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160 (emphasis added).2\r\n2 The standard codified by S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160 (Supp. 2011) for a\r\nmental-mental injury is known as the \"heart attack standard.\" See Powell,\r\n299 S.C. at 327, 384 S.E.2d at 726 (\"Mental or nervous disorders resulting\r\nfrom either physical or emotional stimuli are equally compensable provided\r\nthe emotional stimuli or stressors are incident to or arise from unusual or\r\nextraordinary conditions of employment.\"); Stokes v. First National Bank,\r\n298 S.C. 13, 377 S.E.2d 922 (Ct. App. 1988). A heart attack suffered by an\r\nemployee constitutes a compensable accident if it is induced by unexpected\r\nstrain or overexertion in the performance of his duties of employment, or by\r\nunusual and extraordinary conditions in employment. Bridges v. Housing\r\nAuth., City of Charleston, 278 S.C. 342, 295 S.E.2d 872 (1982). However, if\r\na heart attack results as a consequence of ordinary exertion that is required in\r\nperformance of employment duties in an ordinary and usual manner, and\r\nwithout any untoward event, it is not compensable as an accident. Shealy,\r\n341 S.C. at 457, 535 S.E.2d at 443 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n                                      24 \n\r\n\n      Although we are constrained to decide this case according to the\r\nstandard mandated by the General Assembly, we offer our opinion that this\r\nstandard should be updated to account for the scientific and technological\r\nprogress in medicine and psychology, which have undermined the old public\r\npolicy argument used to deny mental-mental recovery.\r\n\r\n       Historically, a lack of understanding about mental-mental injuries\r\nfueled the negative reaction toward allowing recovery. The traditional\r\njustifications for imposing barriers to recovery were that claims for mental-\r\nmental injuries were easier to falsify than claims for physical injuries, and\r\nany recovery for mental anguish damages must be limited with bright line\r\nrules lest the courts be flooded with litigation. See Frances C. Slusarz, Work\r\nPlace Stress Claims Resulting from September 11th, 18 Lab. Law. 137 (Fall\r\n2002); Jon L. Gillum, Note, Fear of Disease in Another Person: Assessing\r\nthe Merits of an Emerging Tort Claim, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 227 (Nov. 2000).\r\nHowever, those in favor of allowing broader recovery point out that advances\r\nin medical science have made it easier for medical professionals to diagnose\r\nand verify the validity of mental injuries, enabling courts to weed out\r\nfraudulent claims. See Towns v. Anderson, 579 P.2d 1163 (1978) (finding\r\nthat \"the medical profession has made tremendous advances in diagnosing\r\nand evaluating emotional and mental injuries. While psychiatry and\r\npsychology may not be exact sciences, they can now provide sufficiently\r\nreliable information concerning causation and treatment of psychic injuries,\r\nto provide a jury with an intelligent basis for evaluating a particular claim.\");\r\nEckenrode v. Life of Am. Ins. Co., 470 F.2d 1, 3 (7th Cir. 1972) (citation\r\nomitted) (stating that mental anguish can be diagnosed and verified by health\r\nprofessionals). In addition, proponents note that claims of physical injury,\r\nespecially in relation to damages for pain and suffering, can be as susceptible\r\nto fraud as mental-mental injuries, rendering it illogical to allow recovery for\r\none while denying it for the other. Molien v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 616 P.2d\r\n813, 821 (Cal. 1980) (noting the rule requiring mental injury be accompanied\r\nby physical injuries \"encourages extravagant pleading and distorted\r\ntestimony\" by claimants trying to fit their emotional anguish claims into the\r\nphysical injury framework). We agree with these proponents for reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       25 \n\r\n\n      We do not believe that removing South Carolina's heightened\r\nrequirement for mental-mental recovery would result in a flood of litigation\r\ngiven the safeguards that the General Assembly has built into section 42-1-\r\n160.3 S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160 (Supp. 2011). Even without the\r\nrequirement that all compensable mental-mental injuries must arise from\r\nemployment conditions that are unusual and extraordinary, under current law,\r\nclaimants must pass a causation test and show that the employment condition\r\nis the proximate cause of the mental injury. Id. § 42-1-160(B)(2). In\r\naddition, under section 42-1-160(C), mental-mental stress are not considered\r\ncompensable if they result from any event which are \"incidental to normal\r\nemployer/employee relations including, but not limited to, personnel actions\r\nby the employer such as disciplinary actions, work evaluations, transfers,\r\npromotions, demotions, salary reviews, or terminations, except when these\r\nactions are taken in an extraordinary and unusual manner.\" S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n42-1-160. Consequently, when one considers that a claimant must show\r\n\r\n3 California's experience has shown that liberalizing mental-mental recovery\r\ntoo broadly could indeed unintentionally unleash a flood of litigation that\r\nraises costs, burdens the courts, and unduly interferes with the hiring and\r\nfiring of workers. Larson, supra, at § 56.06[1][a]. In Albertson's, Inc. v.\r\nWorkers' Compensation Appeals Board, 182 Cal. Rptr. 304 (1982), the\r\nCalifornia Court of Appeals ruled that the compensability for mental-mental\r\ninjuries could be judged purely on a plaintiff's subjective perception of stress\r\nat work and not objective reality. This overly broad holding dramatically\r\nincreased the workers' compensation claims that were compensable so that by\r\n1986, the number of claims increased nearly seven-fold along with the\r\nexpenses to litigate those claims. Larson, supra, at § 56.06[1][a]. In an effort\r\nto control costs, the California legislature reversed course and enacted a\r\nseries of reforms that made it tougher to recover for mental-mental damages.\r\nId. South Carolina has not and should not allow recovery based on a\r\nclaimant's subjective perception of stress as California did in 1982. Id.\r\nHowever, removing the requirement that the employment condition be\r\nunusual and extraordinary in order to recover is not the same as what was\r\ndone in California, and would not result in a flood of litigation given the\r\nsafeguards already built into section 42-1-160. S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      26 \n\r\n\ncausation and that he is excluded from bringing claims that are \"incidental to\r\nnormal employer/employee relations,\" the framework for recovery\r\nadequately errs on the side of caution even without requiring that all mental-\r\nmental claims arise from unusual and extraordinary conditions of\r\nemployment. Moreover, it has been argued that even if an observed increase\r\nin litigation results, it is the primary business of courts to redress wrongs. W.\r\nPage Keeton et al., Posser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 54, at 360 (5th\r\ned. 1984) (\"It is the business of the courts to make precedent where a wrong\r\ncalls for redress, even if lawsuits must be multiplied . . . .\").\r\n\r\n       If South Carolina reforms section 42-1-160, it would not be alone. At\r\nleast five states already do not require that the conditions of employment be\r\nunusual and extraordinary to be compensable.4 Larson, supra, at §\r\n56.06D[7]. We believe that in light of the safeguards already in place and the\r\nscientific progress made in our understanding and diagnosis of mental-mental\r\ninjuries, the Powell framework as promulgated in 1989 is obsolete.5\r\nRemoving the unduly restrictive barrier in mental-mental cases that requires\r\nemployment conditions to be unusual and extraordinary would further South\r\n\r\n4  Those five states are Hawaii, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and\r\nOregon. Larson, supra, at § 56.06D[7].\r\n5 We note that South Carolina's requirement that in mental-mental cases\r\nemployment conditions causing the mental injury must be unusual and\r\nextraordinary was judicially created before being legislatively adopted. In\r\nPowell v. Vulcan Materials Co., 299 S.C. 325, 327, 384 S.E.2d 725, 726\r\n(1989), this Court applied the \"heart attack standard\" to mental-mental\r\ninjuries and recognized that mental-mental injuries that arose from\r\nextraordinary and unusual conditions of employment are compensable. See\r\nn. 2, supra. In 1989, when the Court decided Powell, section 42-1-160 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code did not specifically address mental-mental injuries nor\r\nrequire that they arise from extraordinary and unusual conditions of\r\nemployment. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160 (1976 & Supp. 1989). Only in\r\n1996 did the legislature amend section 42-1-160 to statutorily adopt Powell's\r\nframework for determining the compensability of mental-mental injuries.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160 (Supp. 1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       27 \n\r\n\nCarolina's public policy of favoring coverage for injuries suffered at work,\r\nwhile not unleashing an uncontainable flood of litigation or unduly burdening\r\nbusiness activities.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, we are interpreters not legislators and are bound by the\r\nlanguage of section 42-1-160 as written. Citizens’ Bank v. Heyward, 135\r\nS.C. 190, 204, 133 S.E. 709, 713 (1925) (\"The primary source of the\r\ndeclaration of the public policy of the state is the General Assembly[, and]\r\nthe courts assume this prerogative only in the absence of legislative\r\ndeclaration.\"). Section 42-1-160 refers to conditions of employment and not\r\nthe frequency of an event occurring during the course of employment. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 42-1-160(B)(1). Furthermore, it requires those conditions to be\r\n\"unusual or extraordinary.\" Id. Unusual or extraordinary conditions refer to\r\nconditions of the particular job, not to conditions of employment generally.\r\nShealy, 341 S.C. at 456, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\n      The parties do not contest that the October 21, 2009 incident, where\r\nAppellant, while on patrol, shot and killed a suspect, is the proximate cause\r\nof Appellant's mental injury. S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160(B)(2); Tennant v.\r\nBeaufort Cnty. Sch. Dist., 381 S.C. 617, 674 S.E.2d 488 (2009) (claimant\r\nmust show that \"unusual or extraordinary conditions were the proximate\r\ncause of the mental disorder\"). The only issue is whether the employment\r\ncondition was extraordinary and unusual with respect to Appellant's\r\nprofession as a deputy sheriff.6 Shealy, 341 S.C. at 456, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\n\r\n      In Stokes v. First National Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 48, 410 S.E.2d 248, 249\r\n(1991), as a result of a merger and the resignation of one of plaintiff's\r\nmanagers, claimant's work hours increased from approximately 45 hours per\r\nweek to 60 hours per week in January 1984; to workdays of approximately 12\r\nto 15 hours in July 1984; and then 16 to 18 hours after November 10, 1984.\r\n6 Black's Law Dictionary defines \"extraordinary\" as \"out of the ordinary,\r\nexceeding the usual, average, or normal measure or degree; beyond or out of\r\nthe common order, method, or rule; not usual, regular or of a customary kind;\r\nremarkable; uncommon; rare; employed for an exceptional purpose or a on a\r\nspecial occasion.\" Black's Law Dictionary 586 (6th ed. 1990). \"Unusual\" is\r\ndefined as \"uncommon; not usual; rare.\" Id. at 1540.\r\n\r\n                                     28 \n\r\n\nThis Court found that Stokes's excessively increased workload constituted an\r\nunusual and extraordinary condition of employment which rendered his\r\nresulting nervous breakdown a compensable accident. Id. at 50, 410 S.E.2d\r\nat 250. It may be tempting to extrapolate that if excessive increases in work\r\nhours constitute an \"extraordinary and unusual\" condition of employment,\r\nthen so too would killing a person in the course of duty. However, Shealy v.\r\nAiken County directs us not to compare apples and oranges, but rather to\r\nexamine cases involving Appellant's particular profession as a deputy sheriff\r\nor law enforcement officer. 341 S.C. 448, 456, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000)\r\n(unusual and extraordinary conditions refers to conditions to the particular\r\njob in which the injury occurs, not to conditions of employment in general).\r\n\r\n       In Shealy, the claimant worked as a deputy sheriff in Lexington County\r\nfrom 1981 to 1990. Id. at 452, 535 S.E.2d at 440. During this time, he\r\ndeveloped depression and an alcohol problem, which led to his departure\r\nfrom his job. Id. In November 1990, the Aiken County Sheriff, aware of\r\nclaimant's alcohol problem, nonetheless, hired him to work as a \"deep cover\"\r\nnarcotics agent. Id. The Aiken County Sheriff's Department hired deep\r\ncover agents to go to known drug locations, typically bars and nightclubs, to\r\nbefriend drug dealers and other criminals in order to gain information,\r\nintelligence, and to make drug buys, which were then given to the police as\r\nevidence. Id. Deep cover work is extremely stressful and differs from\r\nregular police undercover work because agents do not wear a wire, are not\r\noperating under police surveillance, do not have access to police back up, and\r\ndo not carry police identification. Id. In August 1992, following an incident\r\nwith a drug dealer while working undercover, claimant believed that he was\r\nin danger due to constant death threats. Id. at 452–53, 535 S.E.2d at 441. On\r\nDecember 30, 1992, the sheriff's department dismissed him from his job\r\nwhen a new sheriff decided to eliminate the deep cover program. Id.\r\nAccording to claimant, the dismissal caused severe stress because he still\r\nfaced death threats and would lose both his permit to carry a weapon and the\r\nprotection of law enforcement. Id. Claimant was diagnosed with major\r\ndepression, PTSD, anxiety, alcoholism, and panic disorder with agoraphobia.\r\nHe sought workers' compensation benefits, and the Single Commissioner\r\nawarded claimant benefits for aggravation of his preexisting alcoholism and\r\npsychological injury resulting from the extraordinary conditions of his\r\nemployment. Id. at 454, 535 S.E.2d at 441. This Court agreed with the\r\n\r\n                                     29 \n\r\n\nCommissioner finding that substantial evidence in the record demonstrated\r\nthat claimant's work conditions were unusual and extraordinary. Id. at 458,\r\n535 S.E.2d at 444. We held that the \"combination of death threats, gun\r\nincidents with violent drug dealers, high tension confrontations, fear of being\r\nuncovered, and loss of security as a police officer constitutes unusual or\r\nextraordinary conditions of employment when they occur over several\r\nmonths.\" Id. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Shealy is distinguishable from the case at hand. While it is expected\r\nthat deep undercover work is dangerous and stressful, the combination of a\r\nserious death threat, claimant's layoff, and claimant's subsequent loss of\r\npolice protection occurring over a period of several months elevated\r\nclaimant's employment conditions to extraordinary and unusual. Id. No such\r\naggravating combination is present in this case where admittedly Appellant's\r\nmental injuries result solely from the shooting of a suspect who threatened\r\nhim on October 21, 2009.7\r\n\r\n      The use of deadly force is within the normal scope and duties of a\r\nSpartanburg County deputy sheriff.        Claimant himself, upon direct\r\nquestioning, confirmed that he knew that he would sometimes be required to\r\nuse deadly force in his job. In addition, the Spartanburg County Sheriff's\r\nOffice General Order 520.1 provides:\r\n\r\n      Deadly force may be used by officers only when they reasonably\r\n      believe the action is in defense of human life (the officer's or\r\n      others) . . . . When any arrestee initiates action to cause physical\r\n      harm, there should be no hesitancy in using such force as\r\n      necessary to bring that person under control.\r\n7 As to whether the incident was an extraordinary and unusual event,\r\nAppellant presented letters from his psychiatrist and psychologist opining\r\nthat it was, while Respondents presented a letter from an expert vocational\r\nconsultant and certified vocational evaluator opining it was not. We note\r\nthese opinions, but are ultimately persuaded by other factors in this case,\r\nwhich we discuss in the body of this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      30 \n\r\n\n      Deputies are also required to attend the South Carolina Criminal Justice\r\nAcademy where they are instructed on the use of firearms and deadly force,\r\nand each deputy receives annual training in the same area. Moreover,\r\nSpartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright testified that when he became a\r\ndeputy sheriff, he was aware of the possibility that he might be required to\r\nfire his weapon to shoot and kill, and that all deputies are aware of this\r\npossibility through their training.\r\n\r\n      Appellant would like this Court to reframe the issue, take it out of its\r\nparticular employment context, and ask \"whether killing another human\r\nbeing is 'unusual.'\" This approach, however, contradicts Shealy's command\r\nto look at conditions of the particular employment in which the injury occurs\r\nand not to conditions of employment in general. 341 S.C. at 456, 535 S.E.2d\r\nat 442. Appellant also argues that because statistics show that the killing of\r\nsuspects by a Spartanburg County deputy sheriff occurred about once a year,\r\nthis meant that shooting and killing was an unusual and extraordinary event.8\r\nHowever, in defining what constitutes unusual and extraordinary, the statute\r\nand our case law speak of conditions of employment and not the frequency of\r\nan event occurring. S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-160; Shealy, 341 S.C. at 456, 535\r\nS.E.2d at 442. Moreover, if the frequency of killing is the decisive factor,\r\n\r\n8  This same frequency argument has been adopted by the dissent.\r\nFurthermore, the dissent finds it \"difficult to fathom, let alone countenance, a\r\nrule which would allow Deputy Sheriff Bentley to recover workers'\r\ncompensation if he had tripped and fallen and injured his leg while drawing\r\nhis gun on this suspect, yet does not permit him to recover for the real mental\r\ntrauma he undeniably suffered by shooting and killing the man.\" We are\r\ndeeply sympathetic to the views expressed in the learned dissent. While we\r\ncertainly echo the dissent's concerns in our call for reform, we note that the\r\nhypothetical that the dissent employs involves a physical injury that would be\r\ncompensable because it is not constrained by § 42-1-160, which only places\r\nbarriers to recovery in cases involving mental-mental injuries. Here,\r\nhowever, we are dealing with a mental-mental injury and are bound by the\r\nheightened statutory restriction that the conditions of employment must be\r\nunusual and extraordinary.            31 \n\r\n\nthen it is difficult to put a precise number on how many suspects must be\r\nkilled before the killing ceases to be extraordinary and unusual. Under our\r\ncase law, we cannot ignore the particular employment context and hold that\r\nkilling a suspect is generally and inherently extraordinary and unusual.\r\nShealy, 341 S.C. at 456, 535 S.E.2d at 442. Thus, we agree with the\r\nAppellate Panel that the issue this Court must decide is whether or not using\r\ndeadly force, which may result in fatalities, is a standard or necessary\r\ncondition of a deputy sheriff's job, not how frequently the use of deadly force\r\nresults in fatalities.\r\n\r\n      We hold that Appellant's testimony that he \"might be in a situation\r\nwhere he might have to shoot someone,\" similar testimonies by Sheriff\r\nWright that officers were aware of the possibility that they might be required\r\nto shoot and kill, Appellant's training in the use of deadly force, and the\r\ndepartment's policy addressing when deadly force should be used constitutes\r\nsubstantial evidence supporting the Appellate Panel's conclusion that the\r\nOctober 21, 2009 incident was not extraordinary and unusual, but was a\r\nstandard and necessary condition of a deputy sheriff's job.\r\n\r\n                                CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Appellate Panel's holding.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. HEARN, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion in which BEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      32 \n\r\n\n      JUSTICE HEARN: I unequivocally join in the majority's call for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to revisit Section 42-1-160(B) of the South Carolina Code\r\n(Supp. 2010). As the majority thoroughly explains, our present \"mental-\r\nmental\" statute is an anachronism and the time has come for it to be updated\r\nbased on the current understanding of mental injuries. However, I part\r\ncompany with the majority's conclusion that Deputy Sheriff Brandon Bentley\r\nhas failed to prove that shooting and killing another human being in the line\r\nof duty is not an unusual or extraordinary circumstance for a law enforcement\r\nofficer, which is the standard we must apply. I believe that it is and would\r\nreverse, holding the Appellate Panel committed an error of law in ruling\r\notherwise. I therefore respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n       As noted by the majority, beginning with the court of appeals' decision\r\nin Stokes v. First National Bank, 298 S.C. 13, 377 S.E.2d 922 (Ct. App\r\n1988), the compensability of a mental injury caused solely by emotional\r\ndistress has been analyzed consistent with the standard of compensability for\r\nheart attack injury cases. This Court, in Powell v. Vulcan Materials Co., 299\r\nS.C. 325, 384 S.E.2d 725 (1989), specifically approved the court of appeals'\r\ndecision to adopt the heart attack standard—unusual or extraordinary\r\nconditions of employment—to determine compensability in cases of mental-\r\nmental injuries, and quoted this from the Stokes opinion: \"'[M]ental or\r\nnervous disorders resulting from either physical or emotional stimuli are\r\nequally compensable provided the emotional stimuli or stressors are incident\r\nto or arise from unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.'\" Id. at\r\n327, 384 S.E.2d at 726 (quoting Stokes, 298 S.C. at 22, 377 S.E.2d at 927).\r\nIn 1996, the General Assembly, in response to this developing case law,\r\namended section 42-1-160 to limit recovery for purely mental injuries to\r\nsituations where \"it is established that the stressful employment conditions\r\ncausing the mental injury were extraordinary and unusual in comparison to\r\nthe normal conditions of the employment.\" 1996 Act No. 424 § 2.\r\n\r\n      Applying the statute to this case requires us to discern the meaning of\r\nunusual and extraordinary in the context of the responsibilities of a law\r\nenforcement officer. The majority correctly defines \"extraordinary\" as \"out\r\nof the ordinary, exceeding the usual, average, or normal measure or degree;\r\nbeyond or out of the common order, method, or rule; not usual, regular or of\r\na customary kind; remarkable; uncommon; rare; employed for an exceptional\r\n\r\n                                     33 \n\r\n\npurpose or on a special occasion.\" Black's Law Dictionary 586 (6th ed.\r\n1990). Additionally, it defines \"unusual\" as \"uncommon; not usual; rare.\" Id.\r\nat 1540. Therefore, under the plain language of section 42-1-160, Deputy\r\nSheriff Bentley should be able to recover if shooting and killing another\r\nhuman being in the line of duty is not a common occurrence or if it is beyond\r\nwhat is ordinary. The majority finds, on the other hand, primarily because all\r\nofficers are trained for this very eventuality, that it cannot be unusual or\r\nextraordinary. Thus, the majority equates a mere possibility of an event\r\noccurring with it being usual and ordinary. With that analysis, I cannot\r\nagree, because I believe it is contrary to the plain language of the statute and\r\nit improperly conflates the standard of compensability for mental-mental\r\ninjuries with the concept of foreseeability.\r\n\r\n       This record is replete with evidence that Deputy Sheriff Bentley, like\r\nall law enforcement officers, was trained to kill a suspect in the line of duty,\r\nif his own life or the life of another was in jeopardy. However, it is also\r\nundisputed that despite this preparation, the vast majority of law enforcement\r\nofficers fortunately never have to take this grave step; indeed, many never\r\neven draw their gun to fire in the course of their professional lives. In this\r\nregard, the testimony of Deputy Sheriff Bentley's boss, Sheriff Chuck\r\nWright, is particularly compelling. Sheriff Wright testified that in his twenty-\r\ntwo years in law enforcement—seventeen as a patrol officer and five as\r\nsheriff—he never shot someone in the line of duty. He also testified that\r\nduring the prior six years in Spartanburg County, a suspect had been shot and\r\nkilled by a deputy six times, or once per year, on average. Moreover, when\r\nan officer shoots a suspect, an in-house and a SLED investigation are\r\ntriggered, and significantly, the officer is required to take administrative\r\nleave and to see the department's psychologist. In response to the question as\r\nto whether his deputies rarely have to use deadly force, Sheriff Wright\r\nresponded: \"It's not an everyday occurrence, thank God.\" It is difficult to\r\nimagine clearer testimony on whether an event is a common occurrence or is\r\nout of the ordinary, consistent with the definitions noted above.\r\n\r\n      While I do not suggest that we define what is unusual and extraordinary\r\nonly by what is rare, I do believe that the sheer rarity of this situation is a\r\nfactor to consider in determining whether it is unusual and unexpected.\r\nIndeed, this is even borne out by the definitions of extraordinary and unusual\r\n\r\n                                      34 \n\r\n\nemployed by the majority, both of which contemplate an event being a\r\npossibility yet still extraordinary and unusual. See Black's Law Dictionary\r\n586 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \"extraordinary\" as \"out of the ordinary,\r\nexceeding the usual, average, or normal measure or degree; beyond or out of\r\nthe common order, method, or rule; not usual, regular or of a customary kind;\r\nremarkable; uncommon; rare; employed for an exceptional purpose or on a\r\nspecial occasion\"); id. at 1540 (defining \"unusual\" as \"uncommon; not usual;\r\nrare\"). Because the Appellate Panel did not take these ordinary definitions\r\ninto consideration, it committed an error of law. Under the proper standard,\r\nthe evidence unquestionably reveals that shooting and killing a suspect is\r\nboth unusual in terms of the frequency of such an event and extraordinary in\r\nthat it is not a common occurrence in the professional life of a police officer.\r\nI therefore believe the heightened burden has been satisfied. To the extent\r\nthat section 42-1-160(B) would preclude Deputy Sheriff Bentley from\r\nrecovering, this case perfectly illustrates the problem with the present\r\nstandard. I find it difficult to fathom, let alone countenance, a rule which\r\nwould allow Deputy Sheriff Bentley to recover workers' compensation if he\r\nhad tripped and fallen and injured his leg while drawing his gun on this\r\nsuspect, yet does not permit him to recover for the very real mental trauma he\r\nundeniably suffered by shooting and killing the man.\r\n\r\n      In Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455-6, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442,\r\n(2000), which involved the compensability of injuries for mental distress for\r\na \"deep cover\" narcotics officer, we stated: \"In determining whether a work-\r\nrelated injury is compensable, the Workers' Compensation Act is liberally\r\nconstrued toward the end of providing coverage rather than noncoverage in\r\norder to further the beneficial purposes for which it was designed.\" The\r\nmajority, however, loses sight of this lodestar of workers' compensation law\r\nand interprets the phrase \"extraordinary and unusual\" in a manner which is\r\nnot only contrary to the plain meaning of the words used, but also defeats\r\ncoverage. Cast against the proper legal canvas, I would hold that Deputy\r\nSheriff Bentley's mental injuries—injuries which are admitted and\r\nindisputably resulted from this necessary yet regrettable event—are\r\ncompensable because while shooting and killing a suspect in the line of duty\r\nmay have been something he was trained to do, it was clearly an unusual and\r\nextraordinary part of his job as a law enforcement officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      35 \n\r\n\nBEATTY, J., concurs. \n   36\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27141","title":"Fountain v.

Ewart, chief banking officer for First Reliance\r\nBank, as to why the bank would not make a loan on a business venture between\r\nFountain and Ernest Pennell. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor\r\nof Ewart and First Reliance (collectively, Respondents), finding that the statement\r\n\nwas not defamatory, and even if it was, Respondents were protected by a qualified\r\nprivilege. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      In late 2008, Pennell, with encouragement and assistance from Fountain,\r\nsought to refinance or obtain a new loan in order to satisfy a $1.2 million\r\ndelinquent mortgage held by Carolina First Bank on a convenience store owned by\r\nPennell. The purpose of the loan was also to buy out Pennell's existing corporate\r\npartner, and to pay off a delinquent fuel supply charge. Fountain and Pennell also\r\nentered into an employment agreement whereby Fountain would be the store's\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n       This was not Fountain's first experience with a convenience store, as he\r\npreviously had been a member of a failed business venture involving a\r\ncombination convenience store and fast food restaurant (BoJo Tim venture).\r\nAlthough he was not the on-site manager, Fountain went to the store on a daily\r\nbasis to supervise its operation. The BoJo Tim venture had given Carolina First a\r\nmortgage on some of its property, and Ewart, a Carolina First employee, was\r\ninvolved closely with Fountain in the venture. The BoJo Tim venture eventually\r\nhad difficulty repaying the loan, and Fountain was sued, resulting in one judgment\r\nagainst him in favor of Tokyo Leasing for a debit card machine.1\r\n\r\n      With at least some of Fountain's financial background known to Pennell,2\r\nFountain and Pennell approached First Reliance to request funds after two other\r\nlending institutions denied their loan requests. At this point in time, Ewart was the\r\nchief banking officer at First Reliance, and he called Pennell in for a meeting to\r\ndiscuss the matter. Fountain was not present. At that meeting, Ewart stated that\r\nFirst Reliance would not be making the loan if Fountain was involved in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Fountain also had at least four judgments against him unrelated to the BoJo Tim\r\nventure, including: (1) First Reliance for a motorcycle and a tractor; (2) Carolina\r\nFirst involving a boat; (3) First Federal for a line of credit business loan on a\r\nmobile home park; and (4) BB&T for a credit card.\r\n2 When asked if he had told Pennell about his debts which did not relate to the\r\nBoJo Tim venture, Fountain responded, \"Well, that's a Mark Fountain problem.\"\r\n\nbusiness.3 Pennell subsequently relayed Ewart's statement to Fountain, and told\r\nhim to \"tear up\" the agreement between the two of them. Fountain later requested\r\nPennell to meet him at his lawyer's office, where Pennell repeated the statement in\r\nfront of Fountain's attorney.\r\n\r\n       Fountain filed a complaint against First Reliance, Ewart, and Pennell for\r\ndefamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. All three defendants\r\nfiled motions for summary judgment.4 The circuit court granted the motions,\r\nfinding the statement was not defamatory, the publication of the statement was\r\nprivileged, and no intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was\r\nestablished. Fountain appeals only the grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\nFirst Reliance and Ewart on his defamation claim.\r\n\r\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n      I.    Was Ewart's statement to Pennell defamatory?\r\n\r\n      II.   Are Respondents entitled to a qualified privilege?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The record contains three different versions of this statement. Fountain describes\r\nthe statement as being \"that as long as [Fountain] was involved in the transaction\r\nthat First Reliance Bank would never make a loan to [Pennell] in order to refinance\r\nthe Carolina First note and mortgage.\" Pennell recalls Ewart telling him First\r\nReliance could not make him the loan \"under the present status.\" Although Pennell\r\ndoes not remember Ewart referencing Fountain specifically, Pennell believed\r\nEwart was referring to Fountain's involvement. And, finally, Ewart's recollection\r\nwas he told Pennell, \"[I]f Mark [Fountain] was going to be managing the operation,\r\n[First Reliance] would not be making the loan.\" Based on our standard of review\r\non summary judgment, we use Fountain's version of the statement in our analysis.\r\nFleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493-94, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002) (viewing\r\nevidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party on\r\nsummary judgment).\r\n4 Fountain also sued Pennell for breach of contract, and Pennell did not move for\r\nsummary judgment on that claim.\r\n\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       \"When reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court\r\napplies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP.\" Fleming, 350 S.C. at 493, 567 S.E.2d at 860 (citing Peterson v. West Am.\r\nIns. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 94, 518 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 1999)). \"Summary\r\njudgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that\r\nthe moving party must prevail as a matter of law.\" Id. In order to withstand a\r\nmotion for summary judgment \"in cases applying the preponderance of the\r\nevidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere\r\nscintilla of evidence.\" Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330,\r\n673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).      LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      I.     DEFAMATION\r\n\r\n      Fountain first argues the circuit court erred in holding Ewart's statement was\r\nnot defamatory. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"A person makes a defamatory statement if the statement \"tends to harm the\r\nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or deter\r\nthird persons from associating or dealing with him.\" Fleming, 350 S.C. at 494, 567\r\nS.E.2d at 860. The tort of defamation therefore permits \"a plaintiff to recover for\r\ninjury to his or her reputation as the result of the defendant's communications to\r\nothers of a false message about the plaintiff.\" Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers,\r\nL.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 464, 629 S.E.2d 653, 664 (2006). We therefore require a\r\nplaintiff to prove the following four elements to state a claim for defamation: \"(1) a\r\nfalse and defamatory statement was made; (2) the unprivileged publication was\r\nmade to a third party; (3) the publisher was at fault; and (4) either actionability of\r\nthe statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused\r\nby the publication.\" Id. at 465, 629 S.E.2d at 664.\r\n\r\n       \"'To render the defamatory statement actionable, it is not necessary that the\r\nfalse charge be made in a direct, open and positive manner. A mere insinuation is\r\nas actionable as a positive assertion if it is false and malicious and the meaning is\r\nplain.'\" Tyler v. Macks Stores of S.C., Inc., 275 S.C. 456, 458, 272 S.E.2d 633, 634\r\n\n(1980) (quoting Timmons v. News & Press, Inc., 232 S.C. 639, 644, 103 S.E.2d\r\n277, 280 (1958)). Statements therefore may be either defamatory on their face, or\r\ndefamatory by way of innuendo. \"Innuendo is extrinsic evidence used to prove a\r\nstatement's defamatory nature. It includes the aid of inducements, colloquialisms,\r\nand explanatory circumstances.\" Parrish v. Allison, 376 S.C. 308, 325 n.1, 656\r\nS.E.2d 382, 391 n.1 (Ct. App. 2007) (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       Moreover, defamation is classified as either actionable per se or not\r\nactionable per se. Slander, which is involved here, \"is actionable per se when the\r\ndefendant's alleged defamatory statements charge the plaintiff with one of five\r\ntypes of acts or characteristics: (1) commission of a crime of moral turpitude; (2)\r\ncontraction of a loathsome disease; (3) adultery; (4) unchastity; or (5) unfitness in\r\none's business or profession.\" Goodwin v. Kennedy, 347 S.C. 30, 36, 552 S.E.2d\r\n319, 322-23 (Ct. App. 2001). Whether the statement is actionable per se is a\r\nmatter of law for the court to resolve. Erickson v. Jones Street Publishers, LLC,\r\n368 S.C. 444, 465, 629 S.E.2d 653, 664 (2006). If the statement is actionable per\r\nse, then the defendant \"is presumed to have acted with common law malice and the\r\nplaintiff is presumed to have suffered general damages.\" Id. If the statement is not\r\nactionable per se, then \"the plaintiff must plead and prove both common law\r\nmalice and special damages.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      We turn first to the import of the statement on its face, which is that First\r\nReliance would not make the loan so long as Fountain was involved in the venture.\r\nThis is a true statement; First Reliance did refuse to make the loan to Pennell\r\nbecause of Fountain's involvement, and there is no evidence to the contrary. Thus,\r\nRespondents have a complete defense to defamation based on the statement's literal\r\nmeaning. See Parrish, 376 S.C. at 326, 656 S.E.2d at 392 (\"Truth is an affirmative\r\ndefense . . . .\"). Nevertheless, Fountain also argues the statement insinuated that he\r\nwas an unfit businessman, which would be actionable per se if it did so. However,\r\nwe do not believe the statement is capable of any reasonable defamatory\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n       In support of his argument, Fountain relies primarily on Adams v. Daily\r\nTelegraph Co., 292 S.C. 273, 356 S.E.2d 118 (Ct. App. 1986). In Adams, the court\r\nof appeals reversed the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in favor of two\r\nTV stations after broadcasting a press conference where the family of two\r\nmurdered stepbrothers invited other members of the family to come forward and\r\ntake \"truth serum\" or undergo \"truth testing\" regarding the unsolved murders. Id.\r\n\nat 275, 279-80, 356 S.E.2d at 119-20, 122. The family further encouraged the\r\npublic to \"draw their own conclusion\" from the other family member's alleged\r\nrefusal to cooperate. Id. at 276, 356 S.E.2d at 120. The father of one of the\r\nmurdered boys sued for defamation, alleging the broadcasts implied he murdered\r\nthe boys or was guilty of a misprision of a felony. Id. The circuit court granted\r\nsummary judgment by disregarding the alleged innuendo and finding the facts\r\nstated in the two broadcasts were true. Id. at 278, 356 S.E.2d at 121. The court of\r\nappeals reversed, holding that a motion for summary judgment \"will only be\r\nsustained where the court can affirmatively say that the publication is incapable of\r\nany reasonable construction which will render the words defamatory.\" Id. at 279,\r\n356 S.E.2d at 122 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Fountain reads Adams broadly to hold that words with any defamatory\r\nmeaning are sufficient to avoid summary judgment, ignoring that part of the\r\ndecision which states the construction must be \"reasonable.\" Adams therefore does\r\nnot extend to purely conjectural interpretations. Under the proper standard, we\r\nbelieve Fountain failed to adduce facts sufficient to withstand summary judgment\r\nthat Ewart's statement was defamatory by innuendo. During his deposition,\r\nFountain claimed the statement was \"inappropriate\" and \"he just wouldn't say it\r\nbeing a banker,\" but this falls far short of establishing an implied defamatory\r\nmeaning. Moreover, even assuming that Fountain did present sufficient evidence\r\nto establish a defamatory meaning through innuendo, the alleged defamation—that\r\nFountain had a checkered business and financial history and was therefore a poor\r\nlending risk—was indisputably true. Without contradiction, the record reveals\r\nFountain participated in a failed business venture and has a history of neglecting to\r\nrepay his obligations. Thus, even assuming Fountain adduced sufficient evidence\r\nthat the statement implied through innuendo that he was a poor lending risk, it\r\ncould not be deemed defamatory because it was unquestionably true.\r\n\r\n      Therefore, we hold there is no evidence Ewart's statement was defamatory\r\nand summary judgment was proper.\r\n\r\n      II.    QUALIFIED PRIVILEGE\r\n\r\n       Even if we were to find the statement defamatory, we hold Respondents are\r\nentitled to a qualified privilege as a matter of law. Fountain, relying on Swinton\r\nCreek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 514 S.E.2d 126 (1999),\r\nargues that evidence exists to show Respondents abused their privilege and thus\r\n\nthis issue should go to the jury. We believe Fountain misinterprets our holding in\r\nSwinton Creek.\r\n\r\n       \"One who publishes defamatory matter concerning another is not liable for\r\nthe publication if (1) the matter is published upon an occasion that makes it\r\nconditionally privileged, and (2) the privilege is not abused. Id. at 484, 514 S.E.2d\r\nat 134. \"'The essential elements of a conditionally privileged communication may\r\nbe enumerated as good faith, an interest to be upheld, a statement limited in its\r\nscope to this purpose, a proper occasion, and publication in a proper manner and to\r\nproper parties only.'\" Manley v. Manley, 291 S.C. 325, 331, 353 S.E.2d 312, 315\r\n(Ct. App. 1987) (quoting Conwell v. Spur Oil Co. of W. S.C., 240 S.C. 170, 178,\r\n125 S.E.2d 270, 274-75 (1962)). An abuse of the privilege occurs in one of two\r\nsituations: (1) a statement made in good faith that goes beyond the scope of what is\r\nreasonable under the duties and interests involved or (2) a statement made in\r\nreckless disregard of the victim's rights. Swinton Creek, 334 S.C. at 486, 514\r\nS.E.2d at 135. \"While abuse of privilege is ordinarily an issue for the jury, . . . in\r\nthe absence of a controversy as to the facts . . . it is for the court to say in a given\r\ninstance whether or not the privilege has been abused or exceeded.\" Woodward v.\r\nS.C. Farm Bureau Ins. Co., 277 S.C. 29, 32-33, 282 S.E.2d 599, 601 (1981)\r\n(internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Fountain acknowledges the privilege exists in this case, but he argues there\r\nis evidence Respondents abused the privilege under Swinton Creek. There, James\r\nFutch owned and operated Swinton Creek Nursery, a business for which he\r\nborrowed $30,000 from the South Atlantic Production Credit Association. Swinton\r\nCreek, 334 S.C. at 473, 514 S.E.2d at 128. That credit association eventually\r\nmerged with other credit associations to become Edisto Farm Credit. Id. at 473,\r\n514 S.E.2d at 128. Futch became delinquent on his note with Edisto and agreed to\r\nwork on a plan to liquidate the assets of the nursery to pay off his debt, eventually\r\ndeciding to sell some of Swinton Creek's assets and equipment to Durwood\r\nCollins. Id. Collins approached Edisto about a loan for the acquisition. Id. at 474,\r\n514 S.E.2d at 128. Lawton Huggins, the senior loan officer handling Collins' loan\r\napplication, had a conversation with Futch during a visit to the nursery in which\r\nFutch indicated \"time was of the essence because he had other pressing financial\r\nobligations including a past due loan.\" Id. Huggins subsequently wrote Collins a\r\nletter regarding the loan application, which included the following: \"[T]he\r\nprojected income for the nursery is not supported by a successful earnings trend.\r\nIn fact, the operation you are purchasing has been under financial duress.\" Id. at\r\n\n474, 514 S.E.2d at 129. Collins eventually bought the assets for less than the\r\noriginal amount from Futch. Id. at 476, 514 S.E.2d at 129. He also showed Futch\r\nHuggins' letter, who thereafter filed numerous causes of action, including\r\ndefamation, against Edisto and Huggins. Id. at 475, 514 S.E.2d at 129. Edisto\r\nmoved for a directed verdict on the defamation claim arguing it had a qualified\r\nprivilege, and the circuit court granted the motion. Id. at 484, 514 S.E.2d at 133.\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court, and on certiorari we reversed\r\nbecause evidence existed that Huggins' statement went beyond the scope of the\r\nqualified privilege, holding:\r\n\r\n      It is questionable whether a specific comment about Swinton Creek's\r\n      financial status was required to protect any interest or duty covered by\r\n      the privilege. EFC contends it wrote the letter for the sole purpose of\r\n      guiding Buyer into a successful loan application. Yet, Buyer was\r\n      only seeking to buy some of Owner's assets, not the entire Swinton\r\n      Creek operation. Moreover, if EFC wanted to convey to Buyer the\r\n      difficulties of running a nursery in a small town, it could have simply\r\n      made a general statement without specifically referring to Owner.\r\n\r\nId. at 486, 514 S.E.2d at 135 (emphasis added). Thus, our concern in Swinton\r\nCreek was that evidence existed tending to show that the scope of Huggins'\r\nstatement went beyond the circumstances surrounding Collins' involvement in\r\nSwinton Creek Nursery. The same is not true in this case. The store's management\r\nwas an essential part of the analysis for the loan request, and Fountain's role as\r\nmanager therefore was a valid consideration for First Reliance. Unlike Swinton\r\nCreek, there is nothing here indicating that Ewart informing Pennell of his concern\r\nabout Fountain being involved in the business went beyond the scope of the\r\nprivilege. In fact, this statement went straight to the heart of the loan request.\r\nWhile abuse of the privilege ordinarily is a question of fact for the jury, it is for the\r\ncourt to determine in the first instance whether there are facts demonstrating abuse.\r\nHere, the circuit court properly found there is no evidence the privilege was abused\r\nby going beyond its scope.\r\n\r\n        Even though we find Respondents did not abuse the privilege by making a\r\nstatement outside of its scope, this does not end our inquiry. The privilege also can\r\nbe abused if the statement is made in reckless disregard of the victim's rights. See\r\nid. at 486, 314 S.E.2d at 135. As proof of abuse, Fountain points to an affidavit by\r\n\nanother bank official who claims that First Reliance did not follow banking\r\npolicies and regulations in turning down the instant loan request. Negligent\r\nbanking practices have never been claimed in this case, and regardless, negligence\r\nin reviewing a loan application does not bear on whether Respondents acted in\r\nreckless disregard of Fountain's rights by expressing a valid concern about his\r\ninvolvement in the convenience store. Accordingly, Fountain cannot rely on this\r\naffidavit to bootstrap his defamation claim. Therefore, there is no evidence the\r\nprivilege was abused in this situation.\r\n\r\n      Banks are in the business of lending money, and to that end, they necessarily\r\nmake business judgments on the financial viability of prospective borrowers,\r\nincluding their credit history. In this case, Respondents had prior knowledge of\r\nFountain's previous failed business venture, as well as the other numerous\r\njudgments rendered against him. Based on this information, Respondents made a\r\nvalid business judgment to deny the loan to Pennell and Fountain, and Ewart's\r\nstatement in that regard is protected by a qualified privilege. Moreover, while\r\nEwart ostensibly could have declined to provide a reason for refusing the loan, that\r\napproach could damage the bank's reputation and thereby negatively impact its\r\nbusiness. Because Fountain has not shown a scintilla of evidence that Respondents\r\nabused their qualified privilege, the circuit court did not err in granting summary\r\njudgment. See Woodward, 277 S.C. at 32-33, 282 S.E.2d at 601.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       We find Ewart's statement was not defamatory, and even if it was, a\r\nqualified privilege exists in this case. As there was no evidence that this privilege\r\nwas abused by Respondents, summary judgment was proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice E.

Walter Wilkins, III, of Greenville, for\r\n        Respondent.           ___________\r\n\r\n\r\n      JUSTICE KITTREDGE: Appellant Samuel Whitner was convicted\r\nand sentenced for the offense of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor\r\n\nin the first degree. The victim of the sexual abuse was Appellant's then five-\r\nor six-year-old daughter. Appellant assigns error to two evidentiary rulings.\r\nThe first ruling was the denial of Appellant's motion to suppress a tape\r\nrecording of his telephone conversation with the victim wherein he admitted\r\nthe abuse. The second ruling was the denial of Appellant's motion to exclude\r\nevidence in connection with a forensic interview of the minor victim. We\r\nfind no error in the admission of the challenged evidence and affirm.\r\n\r\n                                      I.\r\n\r\n      Appellant is the victim's biological father. According to the victim's\r\ntestimony, when she was five or six years old, Appellant exposed his penis to\r\nvictim and forced her to perform oral sex on him twice.\r\n\r\n      In 2007, when the victim was eleven years old, the victim disclosed the\r\nabuse to her mother (Mother). According to Mother, she encouraged the\r\nvictim to confront Appellant. The victim telephoned Appellant to confront\r\nhim, and he denied the incident. Mother subsequently informed her husband\r\n(Stepfather) about the abuse. The couple decided to record telephone calls\r\nbetween Appellant and the victim. Several days later, Mother consented to\r\nStepfather recording a telephone conversation between the victim and\r\nAppellant without the victim's knowledge or consent. During the thirty-one­\r\nminute conversation, Appellant admitted the sexual abuse and stated that the\r\nincident was a mistake he deeply regretted.\r\n\r\n      Mother supplied the recording to law enforcement, and Appellant was\r\narrested and charged with CSC with a minor in the first degree. As part of\r\nthe investigation, a forensic interview of the victim was conducted.\r\n\r\n      Appellant filed a motion to suppress the recorded telephone\r\nconversation, claiming the recording, intercepted without the prior consent of\r\neither party, violated the South Carolina Homeland Security Act (Wiretap\r\nAct), S.C. Code Ann. § 17-30-10 et. seq. (Supp. 2010), which generally\r\n\nprohibits the interception of communications. A circuit court judge granted\r\nthe motion to suppress.1\r\n\r\n     The State filed an interlocutory appeal with the court of appeals and\r\nsought to vacate the trial court's suppression order pursuant to the Wiretap\r\nAct. The court of appeals correctly granted the State's motion to vacate and\r\nfound that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the\r\nWiretap Act requires that a motion to suppress be made before a panel of\r\njudges of the court of appeals.\r\n\r\n      Thereafter, the court of appeals held a suppression hearing, including\r\nthe taking of testimony and oral arguments. Stepfather testified that he\r\nbelieved recording the conversation would aid the parents in deciding the best\r\ncourse of action for the victim, including determining whether she needed\r\nsexual abuse counseling. Likewise, Mother testified she believed recording\r\nthe conversations would be useful because she did not know what the\r\nconversations between the victim and Appellant entailed, the victim was\r\ncrying often, and she needed to determine if it was appropriate to permit\r\nAppellant to have contact with the victim.\r\n\r\n      On the legal issue of consent, the court of appeals held that the\r\nLegislature, in enacting the Wiretap Act, intended to adopt the vicarious\r\nconsent doctrine. Mother could, therefore, lawfully vicariously consent to the\r\nrecording on behalf of the victim. On the factual matter, the court of appeals\r\nfound that Mother had a good faith and objectively reasonable basis for\r\nbelieving the recording was necessary and in the victim's best interest, and it\r\ntherefore denied Appellant's motion to suppress. The court of appeals sent\r\nthe case back to the trial court.\r\n\r\n      At trial, the recording of the phone conversation between Appellant and\r\nthe victim was admitted, over Appellant's continuing objection. The State\r\nalso introduced a videotape of the victim's forensic interview. The contents\r\nof the interview were similar to the underlying allegations the victim first\r\n\r\n1     The judge who granted the motion to suppress was not the judge who\r\npresided over the trial.\r\n\ndisclosed to Mother and the testimony given by the victim at trial. The\r\nvideotape was admitted over Appellant's objections of improper bolstering\r\nand hearsay. The jury convicted Appellant of CSC with a minor in the first\r\ndegree, and he was sentenced to prison. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\n                                      II.\r\n\r\n      Appellant claims the Wiretap Act was violated because neither he nor\r\nthe victim, the parties to the communication, consented to the recording.\r\nConversely, the State claims the Wiretap Act was not violated because the\r\nrecording fell within the consent provision. Specifically, the State contends\r\nthe statute allows Mother, as a guardian to the minor victim, to vicariously\r\nconsent on behalf of the victim to record the telephone conversation between\r\nthe victim and Appellant.\r\n\r\n      The South Carolina Wiretap Act is patterned after the Omnibus Crime\r\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Federal Act). This Court must\r\ndetermine whether the Wiretap Act allows or bars the admission of the\r\nrecording.\r\n\r\n      Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law, which are\r\nsubject to de novo review and which we are free to decide without any\r\ndeference to the court below. Transp. Ins. Co. & Flagstar Corp. v. S.C.\r\nSecond Injury Fund, 389 S.C. 422, 427, 699 S.E.2d 687, 689 (2010);\r\nCatawba Indian Tribe of S.C. v. State, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751,\r\n753 (2007).\r\n\r\n      The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and\r\neffectuate the intent of the legislature. Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498,\r\n640 S.E.2d 457, 459 (2007). \"All rules of statutory construction are\r\nsubservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be\r\nreasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be\r\nconstrued in light of the intended purpose of the statute.\" State v. Sweat, 386\r\nS.C. 339, 350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010). Absent an ambiguity, the court\r\nwill look to the plain meaning of the words used to determine their effect.\r\nCity of Rock Hill v. Harris, 391 S.C. 149, 155, 705 S.E.2d 53, 55 (2011).\r\n\n\"Under general rules of statutory construction, a jurisdiction adopting\r\nlegislation from another jurisdiction imports with it the judicial gloss\r\ninterpreting that legislation.\" Orr v. Clyburn, 277 S.C. 536, 540, 290 S.E.2d\r\n804, 806 (1982).\r\n\r\n      The Wiretap Act is violated when a person intercepts oral\r\ncommunications that are not otherwise exempt from or subject to an\r\nexception contained in section 17-30-30. Evidence intercepted in violation of\r\nthe Wiretap Act must be suppressed. See S.C. Code Ann. § 17-30-110.\r\nHowever, when a party to a communication gives consent for the\r\ncommunication to be intercepted, such recording does not violate the law.\r\nThe full text of the consent provision states:\r\n\r\n      It is lawful under this chapter for a person not acting under color\r\n      of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication\r\n      where the person is a party to the communication or where one of\r\n      the parties to the communication has given prior consent to the\r\n      interception.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 17-30-30(C) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Appellant argues that because there is no explicit provision permitting\r\nvicarious consent, parental consent on behalf of a minor was not intended to\r\nbe an exception to the Wiretap Act. We disagree.\r\n\r\n     Our Wiretap Act parallels the Federal Act passed by Congress in 1968,\r\nwhich similarly permits lawful interception where one party to the\r\ncommunication consents.2 Because no South Carolina cases have addressed\r\n\r\n2     \"It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person not acting\r\nunder color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication\r\nwhere such person is a party to the communication or where one of the\r\nparties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception\r\nunless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any\r\ncriminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United\r\nStates or of any State.\" 18 U.S.C.A. § 2511 (2006).\r\n\na parent's ability to vicariously consent to the recording of a child's telephone\r\nconversations and because the Federal Act is substantively the same as South\r\nCarolina's Wiretap Act, we look to the federal courts' interpretations\r\nregarding vicarious consent. See Orr, 277 S.C. at 540, 290 S.E.2d at 806\r\n(\"Under general rules of statutory construction, a jurisdiction adopting\r\nlegislation from another jurisdiction imports with it the judicial gloss\r\ninterpreting that legislation.\").\r\n\r\n       The leading federal case is Pollock v. Pollock, 154 F.3d 601 (6th Cir.\r\n1998). In Pollock, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a mother did\r\nnot violate the Federal Act when she recorded conversations between her\r\ndaughter and the daughter's stepmother. The Pollock court, adopting the rule\r\nfirst enumerated in Thompson v. Dulaney, 838 F.Supp. 1535, 1544 (D. Utah\r\n1993), articulated the doctrine of vicarious consent as follows:\r\n\r\n      [A]s long as the guardian has a good faith, objectively reasonable\r\n      basis for believing that it is necessary and in the best interest of\r\n      the child to consent on behalf of his or her minor child to the\r\n      taping of telephone conversations, the guardian may vicariously\r\n      consent on behalf of the child to the recording.\r\n\r\n154 F.3d at 610; see also Wagner v. Wagner, 64 F.Supp.2d 895, 896 (D.\r\nMinn. 1999) (holding a guardian may consent on behalf of a minor to the\r\ninterception of a communication); Campbell v. Price, 2 F.Supp.2d 1186, 1191\r\n(E.D. Ark. 1998) (holding a parent's good faith concern for his minor child's\r\nbest interest may empower the parent to legally intercept the child's\r\nconversations); Thompson v. Dulaney, 838 F. Supp. 1535, 1544 (D. Utah\r\n1993) (finding the vicarious consent doctrine permissible under the federal\r\nwiretap statute because of a parent's duty to act in the best interest of their\r\nchild).\r\n      South Carolina's Wiretap Act, modeled after the Federal Act, was\r\nenacted in 2002. As the above federal jurisprudence indicates, when our\r\nLegislature enacted the Wiretap Act, it was well aware of the majority rule\r\n\nconcerning construction of the Federal Act in allowing for vicarious consent.3\r\nWe are persuaded that the consent provision in the Wiretap Act encompasses\r\nvicarious consent. In reaching this conclusion, we join the majority of state\r\ncourts that have confronted the same question of statutory construction and\r\nhave followed the federal interpretation. Accord Silas v. Silas, 680 So.2d\r\n368 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996); G.J.G. v. L.K.A., No. CN93-09835, 2006 WL\r\n2389340 (Del. Fam. Ct. 2006); State v. Spencer, 737 N.W.2d 124 (Iowa\r\n2007); Smith v. Smith, 923 So.2d 732 (La. App. 1 Cir. 9/28/05); Kroh v.\r\nKroh, 567 S.E.2d 760 (N.C. App. 2002); State v. Diaz, 706 A.2d 264 (N.J.\r\n1998); People v. Clark, 19 Misc.3d 6 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2008); Lawrence v.\r\nLawrence, No. E2010-00395COA-R3-CV, 2010 WL 4865516 (Tenn. Ct.\r\nApp. 2010); Alameda v. State, 235 S.W.3d 218 (Tex. 2007).\r\n\r\n      We further find that Appellant misconstrues the scope of the term\r\n\"consent.\" \"Consent\" is a broad term and is defined as \"agreement, approval,\r\nor permission as to some act or purpose.\" Black's Law Dictionary 346 (9th\r\nEd. 2009). The law recognizes different kinds of consent, including express,\r\nimplied, informed, voluntary, and parental. Parental consent is defined as\r\n\"[c]onsent given on a minor's behalf by at least one parent, or a legal\r\nguardian, or by another person properly authorized to act for the minor, for\r\nthe minor to engage in or submit to a specific activity.\" Id. We believe the\r\nvarious types of consent recognized in the law support the result we reach\r\ntoday in discerning legislative intent to include vicarious consent.4\r\n\r\n3     In fact, prior to the adoption of the Wiretap Act, this Court's\r\njurisprudence relied on federal courts' interpretations of the Federal Act in\r\npermitting the recording of a telephone conversation where only one party to\r\nthe conversation consented. See Mays v. Mays, 267 S.C. 490, 229 S.E.2d\r\n725 (1976) (holding that one party to a telephone conversation may lawfully\r\nrecord the conversation without the other party's knowledge or consent, and\r\nsubsequently disclose it); State v. Andrews, 324 S.C. 516, 479 S.E.2d 808\r\n(Ct. App. 1996) (where one party consents to a recording, it does not violate a\r\nperson's right to privacy).\r\n4     Appellant's argument rests in part on various federal courts' rejection of\r\nthe inter-spousal consent doctrine, which permits one spouse to intercept an\r\nelectronic communication of the other spouse. See e.g., Pritchard v.\r\n\n     In sum, we believe the court of appeals correctly determined that the\r\nconsent provision in the Wiretap Act includes vicarious consent.\r\n\r\n                                       III.\r\n\r\n      Appellant contends that even if the Wiretap Act encompasses vicarious\r\nconsent, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant case. Initially, Appellant\r\nasserts that before the vicarious consent doctrine may be applied, a court\r\nmust find the minor lacked capacity to consent. Additionally, Appellant\r\nargues Mother and Stepfather did not have a good faith and objectively\r\nreasonable basis for believing it was necessary and in the best interest of the\r\nvictim to record the telephone conversation.\r\n\r\n                                       A.\r\n\r\n     Appellant argues that the victim was capable of consenting because she\r\nwas eleven years old at the time of the recording. But a minor's actual ability\r\n\r\n\r\nPritchard, 732 F.2d 372, 373 (4th Cir. 1984) (finding no exception exists\r\nunder the federal wiretapping statute for instances of willful, unconsented to\r\nelectronic surveillance between spouses). However, the fact that there is no\r\ninter-spousal consent exception does not preclude an adoption of a parent-\r\nchild vicarious consent exception. Moreover, we view the vicarious consent\r\ndoctrine as a natural consequence of the unique relationship of parent and\r\nchild. The doctrine's adoption is far more compelling and justifiable than the\r\ninter-spousal consent, as fundamentally different considerations are\r\nimplicated. The United States Supreme Court and this Court have held it is\r\n\"the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,\r\ncustody, and control of their children.\" Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65\r\n(2000); Camburn v. Smith, 355 S.C. 574, 586 S.E.2d 565 (2003) (citing\r\nTroxel and stating \"[i]t is well-settled that parents have a protected liberty\r\ninterest in the care, custody, and control of their children\"). Furthermore,\r\nparents have a duty to protect their child because children \"often lack the\r\nexperience, perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that\r\ncould be detrimental to them.\" Belloti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 635 (1979).\r\n\nto consent does not preclude a parent's ability to vicariously consent on her\r\nbehalf. See Pollock, 154 F.3d 601 (applying the vicarious consent doctrine to\r\na fourteen-year-old); State v. Spencer, 737 N.W.2d 124 (Iowa 2007)\r\n(applying the vicarious consent doctrine to a thirteen-year-old); Alameda v.\r\nState, 235 S.W.3d 218 (Tex. 2007) (applying the vicarious consent doctrine\r\nto a thirteen-year-old). Further, we believe it inadvisable to create a bright-\r\nline age limit for the application of vicarious consent because \"not all\r\nchildren develop emotionally and intellectually on the same timetable.\"\r\nPollock, 154 F.3d at 610. Thus, the ability to invoke the vicarious consent\r\ndoctrine prior to the age of majority does not turn on an age-mandated bright-\r\nline rule, nor does it require a minor's lack of capacity.\r\n\r\n                                      B.\r\n\r\n       Appellant next contends that the court of appeals erred in finding\r\nMother had a good faith and objectively reasonable basis for intercepting the\r\ntelephone conversation between the victim and Appellant. Pursuant to the\r\nprocedure prescribed by the Wiretap Act,5 the court of appeals acted as the\r\ntrial court in the motion to suppress hearing. \"The admission of evidence is\r\nwithin the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an\r\nabuse of discretion.\" State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93\r\n(2002). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based\r\non an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without\r\nevidentiary support.\" Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528,\r\n539 (2000).\r\n\r\n      The parents' motivation in recording the telephone conversation is a\r\nquestion of fact. Given our standard of review, the issue before us is limited\r\nto a determination of whether there was any evidence supporting the court of\r\n\r\n\r\n5     S.C. Code Ann. § 17-30-110 states: \"The motion [to suppress] must be\r\nmade before the reviewing authority and must be decided on an expedited\r\nbasis.\" The \"reviewing authority\" is defined as \"a panel of three judges of the\r\nSouth Carolina Court of Appeals designated by the Chief Judge of the South\r\nCarolina Court of Appeals.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 17-30-15(9).\r\n\nappeals' finding that the parents had a good faith basis for intercepting and\r\nrecording the phone conversation.\r\n\r\n       Mother and Stepfather testified they believed the recordings would\r\nassist them in deciding the best course of action and in determining whether\r\nthe victim needed counseling. Likewise, Mother testified it was necessary to\r\ndetermine if it was in the victim's best interest to have continued visitation\r\nwith Appellant. We believe the evidence supports the court of appeals'\r\nfinding that Mother had a good faith and objectively reasonable belief that\r\nintercepting the telephone conversation was necessary and in the victim's best\r\ninterest.6 Thus, we conclude the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion\r\nin denying the motion to suppress.    IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n6      Although we recognize the fundamental right of parents to make\r\ndecisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children, we also\r\nrecognize, as does the concurrence, that such right is not without limits. As\r\nthe concurrence states, \"constitutional protection does not confer on parents\r\nan unlimited right to control their children.\" While we agree, in the abstract,\r\nwith the concurrence's sweeping recognition of parents' fundamental right to\r\nmake decisions concerning the welfare of their children, we must confront\r\nthe issue in the context presented and not venture into areas never raised,\r\nargued or briefed by any party. Appellant argues only that the Wiretap Act\r\ndoes not provide for vicarious consent; we have not been presented with a\r\nchallenge or discussion of the viability of Pollock post-Troxel. Assuming\r\nthat issue were squarely before us, we would adhere to the Pollock doctrine\r\nin this case. In this criminal case against the Appellant father, we are\r\npresented with one parent, Mother, vicariously consenting to recording her\r\nchild's telephone conversation with the other parent, Appellant. In the\r\ncontext where one parent vicariously consents to record a child's electronic\r\ncommunication with the other parent, we believe the Pollock doctrine, by\r\nimposing a good faith standard linked to the child's best interest, sets forth a\r\nproper and reasonable limitation on a parent's right to make decisions\r\nconcerning the child.\r\n\n       Appellant also contends the interception of the phone conversation was\r\nan unreasonable invasion of privacy under the additional protections afforded\r\nby our state's constitution. See S.C. Const. art. I, § 10 (\"The right of the\r\npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures and unreasonable invasions of privacy\r\nshall not be violated . . . .\"). We disagree. Appellant's argument is dependent\r\nupon a rejection of the vicarious consent doctrine. Because the Wiretap Act\r\nprovides for vicarious consent of a minor child, Appellant's constitutional\r\nargument must be rejected.            V.\r\n\r\n      Appellant's final issue on appeal addresses the admissibility of the\r\nforensic interview videotape, contending it was cumulative repetition of the\r\nminor victim's testimony at trial and improper bolstering. We disagree. As\r\nwith any issue regarding the admissibility of evidence, we review the trial\r\ncourt's ruling for abuse of discretion. State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631\r\nS.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).\r\n\r\n      Generally, a prior consistent statement is not admissible unless the\r\nwitness is charged with fabrication or improper motive or bias. Rule\r\n801(d)(1)(B), SCRE. However, in CSC cases involving minors, the\r\nLegislature has made specific allowances for such hearsay statements of child\r\nvictims under the proper circumstances. See S.C. Code Ann. § 17-23-175\r\n(Supp. 2010) (prescribing the requirements that must be met for a child\r\nvictim's out-of-court statement to be admitted). Moreover, the South\r\nCarolina Rules of Evidence explicitly recognize the authority of the\r\nLegislature to enact evidentiary rules. See Rule 101, SCRE (\"Except as\r\notherwise provided by rule or by statute, these rules govern proceedings in\r\nthe courts of South Carolina . . . .\"). Unless a legislative enactment\r\nconcerning a matter of evidence violates the constitution, the legislative\r\nenactment is valid. See City of Rock Hill v. Harris, 391 S.C. 149, 154, 705\r\nS.E.2d 53, 55 (2011) (holding that the General Assembly may enact any law\r\nnot expressly, or by clear implication, prohibited by the state or federal\r\nconstitutions).\r\n\n       Section 17-23-175 is a valid legislative enactment. Admittedly, we\r\nhave confronted instances where the State has abused the statute and sought\r\nto have the forensic interviewer, improperly imbued with the imprimatur of\r\nan expert witness, invade the province of the jury by vouching for the\r\ncredibility of the alleged victim. However, this is not such a case. In fact,\r\nthe forensic interview of the child and mere foundational trial testimony of\r\nthe interviewer serve as a model of how the statute is designed to work.\r\nSpecifically, the forensic interviewer did not improperly lead or influence the\r\nvictim in any way, and the victim answered the questions on her own accord.\r\nMoreover, the forensic interviewer's testimony was for the limited purpose of\r\nlaying the proper foundation for the admission of the videotape.7 It offered\r\nno improper testimony, and included no bolstering testimony that would\r\ninvade the province of the jury. Compare State v. Jennings, --- S.C. ---, 716\r\nS.E.2d 91 (2011) (finding the trial court erred in admitting portions of\r\nforensic interviewer's written reports that went to the victims' veracity for\r\ntruth regarding the allegations of abuse) with State v. Douglas, 380 S.C. 499,\r\n671 S.E.2d 606 (2009) (holding that trial court's admission of testimony from\r\na forensic interviewer did not prejudice defendant as interviewer testified as\r\nto her personal observations and did not vouch for the victim's veracity).\r\nThus, there was no error in the admission of the forensic interview into\r\nevidence.                            VI.\r\n\r\n      In sum, we believe the Legislature intended the consent provision in the\r\nWiretap Act to encompass the vicarious consent of a parent on behalf of a\r\nminor child. Moreover, there was evidence from which the court of appeals\r\ncould conclude the parents had a good faith and objectively reasonable basis\r\nfor recording the phone conversation and, accordingly, the court of appeals\r\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to suppress. Additionally,\r\nwe find no error in the trial court's admission of the forensic interview\r\nvideotape.\r\n\r\n7     We recognize that the State sought on direct examination to venture\r\ninto the forbidden area of improper bolstering, but Appellant's objections\r\nwere promptly sustained.\r\n\n     AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      TOAL, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in a separate opinion in which Acting Justice Eugene C.\r\nGriffith, concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur with the result reached by the majority\r\nbut write separately to express my concerns regarding the majority’s adoption\r\nof the Pollock test, which I believe places an undue burden on a parent to\r\njustify his vicarious consent on behalf of his child under South Carolina’s\r\nWiretap Act. I also write separately regarding the admission of bolstering\r\ntestimony under S.C. Code Ann. § 17-23-175 (Supp. 2010).\r\n                                        I.\r\n       I agree with the majority that the Wiretap Act permits the substitution\r\nof a parent’s consent for that of a minor who is a party to the communication.\r\nHowever, the Pollock test, articulated in Pollock v. Pollock, 154 F.3d 601\r\n(6th Cir. 1998), and adopted by the majority without alteration, fails to fully\r\naccount for the scope of parental rights under the United States Constitution.8\r\n\r\n       Under the Pollock test, “a clear emphasis is put on the need for the\r\n‘consenting’ parent to demonstrate a good faith, objectively reasonable basis\r\nfor believing such consent was necessary for the welfare of the child.” 154\r\nF.3d at 610. The test is said to “create[] important limitations on the ability\r\nof a parent or guardian to vicariously consent to the recording of his or her\r\nchild’s conversations.” State v. Spencer, 737 N.W.2d 124, 131 (Iowa 2007)\r\n(emphasis added). The “good faith, objectively reasonable basis” limitation\r\nin the Pollock test was adopted from Thompson v. Dulaney, the first case to\r\nconsider the question whether the federal Wiretap Act should be interpreted\r\nto include a vicarious consent exception. 838 F.Supp. 1535 (D. Utah 1993).\r\n\r\n8 The majority believes that consideration of the Pollock test’s viability post-\r\nTroxel is not appropriate because this issue has not been raised by any party.\r\nI do not believe we can avoid considering the implications of Troxel on this\r\nbasis while also explicitly adopting and applying a particular test without\r\nqualification. Avoiding Constitutional issues not raised and argued could be\r\ndealt with by holding that even if the Pollock test is unconstitutionally\r\nrestrictive, its demands would be met in this case. Moreover, I would\r\nrespectfully urge that the majority’s conclusion that it would adhere to the\r\nPollock test after consideration of Troxel based on its view that the good faith\r\nstandard is “a proper and reasonable limitation” under these circumstances is\r\nan interest-balancing test of the sort inappropriate for treatment of\r\nfundamental rights.\r\n\nIn Thompson, the parent argued that she had a constitutional right to direct\r\nthe upbringing of her children. However, in finding that a vicarious consent\r\nexception was implied in the Wiretap Act, the court based its reasoning on\r\nthe parent’s statutory duty. The court found that in order for the parent to\r\nfulfill her duty under a Utah statute to protect her children, she must be able\r\nto supervise their communication with third parties, at least when the children\r\nare very young, as they were in the case it was considering. Id. at 1544. The\r\nThompson court did not explain what interests created a need for a limitation\r\non parents’ authority to vicariously consent for their children under the\r\nfederal Wiretap Act. Other courts that have adopted the vicarious consent\r\ndoctrine have noted in passing that a parent has a constitutional right to guide\r\nthe upbringing of her children, but they have not directly addressed the\r\nconstitutionality of the “good faith, objectively reasonable basis” limitation\r\nor explained why it is important.\r\n\r\n      Some commentators have criticized the Pollock test for failing to\r\nadequately account for a minor’s right to privacy. Spencer, 737 N.W.2d at\r\n131-32 (citing commentators who raise this concern). Presumably it is a\r\nminor’s right to privacy that concerned the Thompson, Pollock, and other\r\ncourts and that they sought to protect through the good faith limitation, even\r\nthough the result does not provide as much privacy to minors as some\r\ncommentators would desire.\r\n\r\n      Minors do have some legally recognized right to privacy, most notably\r\nthe “privacy” of being able to make some choices that are essential to a\r\nperson’s most basic autonomy. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern\r\nPennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 899 (1992). In Casey, the United\r\nStates Supreme Court found that under certain narrow circumstances a\r\nminor’s fundamental right to privacy would be violated by a government-\r\nenforced parental veto of the minor’s choice. Aside from the right of a\r\nmature minor to make some irreversible and life-altering decisions, however,\r\na minor’s interest in privacy has barely been accorded legal recognition. It\r\nhas been accorded least recognition vis-à-vis parents.9 Moreover, Casey\r\n\r\n9See, e.g., Benjamin Shmueli and Ayelet Blecher-Prigat, Privacy for\r\nChildren, 42 COLUM. HUM. RTS. L. REV. 759, 763, 793, 794 (Spring 2011)\r\n\ninvolved state action operating to override the choice of a minor with the\r\ncapacity to make the choice at issue. That is, insofar as the Constitution\r\nprotects the privacy interests of minors, it protects them from governmental\r\nintrusion, not from parental intrusion unaided by government.\r\n\r\n       On the other hand, a parent has a right under the Constitution to guide\r\nthe upbringing of her child. In Troxel v. Granville,10 decided after both\r\nThompson and Pollock, the Court identified as “fundamental [the] right of\r\nparents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their\r\nchildren.” 530 U.S. 57, 66 (2000) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added).\r\nSeven justices agreed that the constitutional right of a parent to direct the\r\nupbringing of her child is violated when her judgment regarding the child’s\r\nassociations is not accorded deference by the courts. 530 U.S. at 67\r\n(plurality), 78-79 (Souter, J., concurring), 80 (Thomas, J., concurring), 94\r\n(Kennedy, J., dissenting). Of course, as with other constitutional rights, the\r\nconstitutional protection does not confer on parents an unlimited right to\r\ncontrol their children, but it limits the extent of governmental involvement in\r\na particular area and places a heavy burden on the state to justify any\r\ngovernmental restriction of parental rights. The Wiretap Act, read without an\r\nexception, would substantially restrict parental rights in favor of an interest\r\n\r\n\r\n(surveying American jurisprudence and concluding that privacy rights “do[]\r\nnot exist for children vis-à-vis their parents”; noting that even the U.N.\r\nConvention for the Rights of the Child, “which is the most comprehensive\r\nlegal document ever written on children’s rights, and which brought more\r\nthan twenty countries around the world to adopt a ban on parental corporal\r\npunishment and to grant a plethora of children’s rights, has not clarified this\r\nchildren’s right”; and acknowledging that legal intervention in this area poses\r\na significant risk of damaging families and “must be very delicate”).\r\n10 In Troxel v. Granville, a Washington state statute permitted any party to\r\npetition for visitation rights and permitted the court to award visitation rights\r\nif it concluded that they were in the child’s best interest without according\r\nany deference to the parent’s judgment. The Court found that a mother’s\r\nsubstantive due process rights were violated when the state court awarded\r\nvisitation to the children’s paternal grandparents based on its disagreement\r\nwith the mother regarding the appropriate amount of visitation.\r\n\nthat has received little if any legal protection in any other context. Read with\r\na limited exception, the Wiretap Act subjects the exercise of parental\r\nconstitutional rights to substantial state supervision, again in favor of a barely\r\nrecognized interest. In my view, either of those readings fails to withstand\r\nthe strict scrutiny ordinarily applied to governmental restrictions on\r\nfundamental rights.\r\n\r\n       Troxel concerned the appropriate treatment of parental constitutional\r\nrights when a court was reviewing a fit parent’s decision regarding the social\r\nactivities of her child, much as the Pollock test involves a court in reviewing\r\na presumptively fit parent’s decision regarding the social activities of her\r\nchild. The plurality opinion in Troxel states that the fundamental\r\nconstitutional right of parents to guide the upbringing of their children\r\nmandates “a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their\r\nchildren.” Id. at 68. The Pollock test reverses this presumption by placing\r\nthe burden of proof on the parent to demonstrate that his motives for\r\nrecording his child’s conversation were proper and based on objectively\r\nreasonable concerns. Thus, the Pollock test is not viable after Troxel, at least\r\nas to its allocation of the burden of proof.\r\n\r\n      Moreover, I am concerned with the import of the majority’s discussion\r\nof a child’s age and capacity to consent as being relevant to a determination\r\nwhether a parent’s vicarious consent was valid. The majority eschews any\r\nbright-line rule based on the minor’s age and capacity to consent.\r\nPresumably this means that a court reviewing a parent’s decision to invade\r\nthe minor’s privacy should deem that decision less objectively reasonable the\r\nmore mature the minor is. But a sliding-scale test provides such little\r\nconstraint on courts as to transfer nearly limitless discretion to them to\r\noverride the judgment of a fit parent, in direct contravention of Troxel.\r\n\r\n      Further militating against the adoption of the Pollock test, at question\r\nhere is a statute that, in the absence of an exception, criminalizes a parent’s\r\n\nrecording of his child’s conversation with a third party.11 Thus, under the\r\nWiretap Act the primary adversarial parties are the government and the\r\nparent, not the parent and child or the parent and a third party.12 Under the\r\nPollock test, a parent cannot exercise her fundamental constitutional right to\r\nguide the upbringing of her child without risking criminal penalty should a\r\ncourt disbelieve her stated motives, disagree with her assessment of the threat\r\nposed by the particular circumstances, or find that the child’s age or capacity\r\nto consent sufficiently negates the parent’s otherwise valid concerns. Such\r\ntreatment of fundamental rights protected by the Constitution is\r\nimpermissible. See, e.g., Casey, 505 U.S. at 893-95. The majority’s\r\nrejection of a bright-line rule exacerbates the constitutional problem with the\r\ngood faith test by creating greater uncertainty for parents of maturing but\r\nunemancipated minors in discerning the line between protected and\r\ncriminalized conduct.\r\n\r\n       In light of the fact that the Wiretap Act criminalizes violations and that\r\nthe parental right is fundamental under the Constitution, I do not believe there\r\nis room for any qualification of the vicarious consent exception. At the very\r\nleast, the majority’s test must be recast in order to place the burden on the\r\nparty asserting that the parent’s consent was invalid to prove that the parent\r\ndid not act in good faith or in reliance on objectively reasonable concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n11 A person who violates the provisions of the South Carolina Wiretap Act\r\nmust be imprisoned not more than five years or fined not more than five\r\nthousand dollars, or both. S.C. Code Ann. § 17-30-50 (Supp. 2010).\r\n12 The issue typically arises in cases that do not involve the state attempting\r\nto prosecute a parent, such as in the present case, in which a third party seeks\r\nto have evidence excluded as obtained in violation of the Wiretap Act. The\r\nfact that the issue may be raised by a third party does not alter my analysis\r\nfor two reasons. First, our interpretation of the consent exception will apply\r\nin all contexts. Second, one party to a protected communication has no\r\nexpectation of privacy under the Wiretap Act if the other party consents to\r\nrecording or disclosure. Thus, the third party’s interest in nondisclosure has\r\nno bearing on the question whether a parent may vicariously consent on\r\nbehalf of his child.\r\n\n                                        II.\r\n       With regard to Appellant’s argument regarding impermissible\r\nbolstering, I would note that Appellant has not raised a challenge to the\r\nstatute on constitutional grounds or challenged the admission of the\r\ninterviewer’s testimony or opinions. Rather, Appellant challenges as\r\nimproper bolstering the admission of duplicative testimony from the child\r\nherself via the videotape. I agree with the majority that the Rules of\r\nEvidence recognize the authority of the General Assembly to enact statutes\r\nthat create exceptions to the evidentiary rules. Rule 101, SCRE. Section 17­\r\n23-175 by its terms permits the duplication of a child’s testimony through the\r\nadmission of a video recorded interview in addition to the child’s testimony\r\nin court. Thus, there is no basis for an improper bolstering argument when\r\nprior testimony is admitted pursuant to § 17-23-175, and I agree with the\r\nmajority that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he admitted the\r\nvideotaped interview.\r\n\r\n     For the reasons set forth above, I would hold that parental vicarious\r\nconsent satisfies the Wiretap Act’s consent exception for all fit parents of\r\nunemancipated minors regardless of the minor’s age or capacity to consent. I\r\nwould also modify the discussion of admissibility under § 17-23-175.\r\nBecause I agree with the result reached by the majority on each issue, I\r\nconcur in the judgment.\r\n\r\nActing Justice Eugene C.

Although\r\nBrentwood Homes concedes the Home Purchase Agreement does not meet the\r\ntechnical requirements of the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (the\r\n\"UAA\"),1 it claims the court erred in denying the motion because the transaction\r\ninvolved interstate commerce and, thus, was subject to the Federal Arbitration Act\r\n(\"FAA\").2 We affirm.      I.    Factual/Procedural History\r\n\r\n       On January 31, 2007, Bradley and Brentwood Homes entered into a Home\r\nPurchase Agreement (the \"Agreement\") for the purchase of a home located in\r\nNorth Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In the Agreement, Bradley and his wife were\r\ndesignated as the purchasers and Brentwood Homes was designated as the seller.\r\nPursuant to the Agreement, Bradley agreed to purchase a completed dwelling\r\nwherein Brentwood Homes acted as a seller of the completed dwelling rather than\r\nas a contractor for the construction of the dwelling.3 The closing of the home took\r\nplace on March 2, 2007.\r\n\r\n      On July 31, 2009, Bradley initiated a lawsuit against Brentwood Homes in\r\nwhich he alleged numerous construction defects in the dwelling. In his Complaint,\r\nBradley identified causes of action for fraud, negligence, and breach of implied\r\nwarranty.\r\n\r\n     After six months of discovery requests by Bradley, Brentwood Homes filed\r\nan Amended Answer and Counterclaim on February 5, 2010. In this responsive\r\n\r\n1   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-48-10 to -240 (2005 & Supp. 2011).\r\n2   9 U.S.C.A. §§ 1-16 (2009 & Supp. 2012).\r\n3   Section 22H states:\r\n\r\n        It is understood that Purchaser is buying a completed dwelling and\r\n        that Seller is not acting as a contractor for Purchaser in the\r\n        construction of a dwelling. Purchaser will acquire no right, title or\r\n        interest in the dwelling except the right and obligation to purchase the\r\n        same in accordance with the terms of this Agreement upon the\r\n        completion of the dwelling.\r\n\npleading, Brentwood Homes claimed the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to\r\nrule on Bradley's lawsuit as the Agreement provided for arbitration. Brentwood\r\nHomes concurrently filed a motion to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration.\r\n\r\n      In support of this motion, Brentwood Homes referenced subsection 14G in\r\nthe Agreement, which provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n      Mandatory Binding Arbitration.4 Purchaser and Seller each agree\r\n      that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, they desire to arbitrate\r\n      all disputes between themselves. The list of disputes which shall be\r\n      arbitrated in accordance with this paragraph include, but are not\r\n      limited to: (1) any claim arising out of Seller's construction of the\r\n      home, (2) Seller's performance under any Punch List or Inspection\r\n      Agreement, (3) Seller's performance under any warranty contained in\r\n      this Agreement or otherwise, and (4) any matters as to which\r\n      Purchaser and Seller agree to arbitrate.\r\n\r\n       Alternatively, Brentwood Homes claimed that even if the arbitration\r\nprovision in the Agreement did not comply with the requirements of the UAA,5 it\r\nwas subject to the FAA as the transaction involved interstate commerce.\r\nSpecifically, Brentwood Homes claimed the Agreement \"on its face involves\r\ninterstate commerce\" as it provides that the Seller will purchase a warranty from 2-\r\n10 HBW Warranty,6 or such other national warranty, and that claims would be\r\nsubmitted to the East Region of 2-10 HBW, which is located in Tucker, Georgia.\r\nAdditionally, Brentwood Homes supplemented its motion with affidavits from\r\n\r\n4 The second page of the Agreement also contained the following statement:\r\n\"THIS CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY BINDING\r\nARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA or NORTH\r\nCAROLINA     UNIFORM      ARBITRATION        ACT,     WHICHEVER        IS\r\nAPPLICABLE.\"\r\n5 See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-48-10(a) (2005) (\"Notice that a contract is subject to\r\narbitration pursuant to this chapter shall be typed in underlined capital letters, or\r\nrubber-stamped prominently, on the first page of the contract and unless such\r\nnotice is displayed thereon the contract shall not be subject to arbitration.\").\r\n6 Section 14C of the Agreement provides that the \"2-10 HBW Warranty includes a\r\nprovision requiring all disputes that arise under the 2-10 HBW Warranty to be\r\nsubmitted to binding arbitration.\"\r\n\nBradley and Edward M. Terry, who was the Vice-President of Brentwood Homes\r\non January 31, 2007.7 Bradley's affidavit established that the home purchase was\r\nfinanced by a North Carolina branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank & Co. In his\r\naffidavit, Terry attested that Brentwood Homes \"used subcontractors, materials and\r\nsuppliers from outside of the State of South Carolina\" in the construction of\r\nBradley's home.\r\n\r\n        At the hearing before the circuit court, Bradley initially opposed the motion\r\nto compel arbitration on the ground Brentwood Homes waived the right to assert\r\nthe affirmative defense due to its delay in responding to discovery requests.\r\nRegarding the merits, Bradley claimed the arbitration clause in the Agreement did\r\nnot satisfy the statutory requirements of the UAA as it was not on the first page of\r\nthe Agreement and was not identified by capital letters and underlining.\r\nAlternatively, Bradley asserted the Agreement was not subject to the FAA because\r\nit was \"just a general contract to purchase and sell the home\" and, thus, did not\r\ninvolve interstate commerce. Bradley objected to Brentwood Homes' reliance on\r\nTerry's affidavit to support its claim that the transaction involved interstate\r\ncommerce as Terry had no direct involvement with the home purchase. At the\r\nconclusion of the hearing, the court orally denied the motion to stay the\r\nproceedings and compel arbitration.\r\n\r\n       By written order, the court found the Agreement did not comply with the\r\nstatutory requirements of the UAA. In turn, the court assessed whether the\r\nAgreement was subject to the FAA. In making this determination, the court\r\nconsidered the terms of the Agreement, the pleadings and motions, the affidavits\r\nand accompanying documents, and the arguments of counsel. The court found the\r\nAgreement \"does not refer to equipment and materials to be furnished from outside\r\nthe state of South Carolina, nor does it list any subcontractors which were outside\r\nthe confines of this state.\" The court also discounted Terry's affidavit based on\r\ndiscovery responses, which indicated that Terry did not deal directly with Bradley.\r\nUltimately, the court held the Agreement was not subject to the FAA as Brentwood\r\nHomes had \"not submitted sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the transaction\r\nbetween [Bradley and Brentwood Homes] involved interstate commerce.\"\r\n\r\n       Brentwood Homes appealed the order to the Court of Appeals. This Court\r\ncertified the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n7  Terry later became President of Brentwood Homes, but resigned from this\r\nposition in May 2009.\r\n\n                                 II.    Discussion\r\n\r\n                                         A.\r\n       We begin our analysis with a general discussion of our appellate courts'\r\ninterpretation and application of the FAA.\r\n\r\n      \"Arbitrability determinations are subject to de novo review.\" Simpson v.\r\nMSA of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 373 S.C. 14, 22, 644 S.E.2d 663, 667 (2007).\r\n\"Nevertheless, a circuit court's factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if\r\nany evidence reasonably supports the findings.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Brentwood Homes concedes the Agreement does not meet the technical\r\nrequirements of section 15-48-10(a) of the UAA as the arbitration provision is not\r\nunderlined and does not appear on the first page of the contract. This concession,\r\nhowever, is not dispositive. Because an application of the South Carolina law\r\nwould have rendered the parties' arbitration agreement completely unenforceable,\r\nconsideration of the applicability of the FAA is required. The FAA is intended to\r\nensure that arbitration will proceed in the event a state law would have preclusive\r\neffect on an otherwise valid arbitration agreement. See Marmet Health Care Ctr.,\r\nInc. v. Brown, 132 S. Ct. 1201, 1203 (2012) (\"[W]hen state law prohibits outright\r\nthe arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The\r\nconflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.\" (quoting AT&T Mobility, LLC v.\r\nConcepcion, 131 S. Ct. 1740, 1747 (2011))); Volt Info. Scis. v. Bd. of Trs. of\r\nLeland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 476 (1989) (stating that \"the federal\r\npolicy [of the FAA] is simply to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms,\r\nof private agreements to arbitrate\").\r\n\r\n       Thus, although the parties were free to agree that our state arbitration act\r\nwould apply, the FAA would preempt an application of our state law to the extent\r\nit invalidated the arbitration agreement, if interstate commerce is involved. See\r\nZabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 592, 553 S.E.2d 110, 116 (2001)\r\n(\"While the parties may agree to enforce arbitration agreements under state rules\r\nrather than FAA rules, the FAA will preempt any state law that completely\r\ninvalidates the parties' agreement to arbitrate.\"); Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp.,\r\n343 S.C. 531, 539 n. 2, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363 n. 2 (2001) (\"State law was therefore\r\npreempted to the extent it would have invalidated the arbitration agreement. The\r\nparties to a contract are otherwise free to agree that our state Arbitration Act will\r\n\napply and this agreement shall be enforceable even if interstate commerce is\r\ninvolved.\" (second emphasis added)); Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl.,\r\nInc., 323 S.C. 454, 476 S.E.2d 149 (1996) (holding that FAA displaced South\r\nCarolina notice-requirement statute, which would have precluded arbitration,\r\nwhere parties agreed to arbitration and the transaction involved interstate\r\ncommerce).\r\n\r\n       The FAA provides: \"A written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a\r\ntransaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter\r\narising out of such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save\r\nupon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"\r\n9 U.S.C.A. § 2. Therefore, in order to activate the application of the FAA, the\r\ncommerce involved in the contract must be interstate or foreign. 2 S.C. Jur.\r\nArbitration § 6 (Supp. 2012) (\"Interstate commerce is a necessary basis for\r\napplication of the federal act, and a contract or agreement not so predicated must\r\nbe governed by state law. To activate application of the federal act, the commerce\r\ninvolved in the contract must be interstate or foreign.\").\r\n\r\n        \"The United States Supreme Court has held that the phrase 'involving\r\ncommerce' is the same as 'affecting commerce,' which has been broadly interpreted\r\nto mean Congress intended to utilize its powers to regulate interstate commerce to\r\nits full extent.\" Blanton v. Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 540 570 S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2002) (citing Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265 (1995)).\r\n\"Congress' Commerce Clause power 'may be exercised in individual cases without\r\nshowing any specific effect upon interstate commerce' if in the aggregate the\r\neconomic activity in question would represent 'a general practice . . . subject to\r\nfederal control.'\" Citizens Bank v. Alafabco, Inc., 539 U.S. 52, 56-57 (2003)\r\n(quoting Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. Am. Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219,\r\n236 (1948)). \"Despite this expansive interpretation of the FAA, the FAA does not\r\nreflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.\" Zabinski,\r\n346 S.C. at 591, 553 S.E.2d at 115-16 (citing Volt, 489 U.S. at 478).\r\n\r\n       \"To ascertain whether a transaction involves commerce within the meaning\r\nof the FAA, the court must examine the agreement, the complaint, and the\r\nsurrounding facts.\" Id. at 594, 553 S.E.2d at 117. \"Our courts consistently look to\r\nthe essential character of the contract when applying the FAA.\" Thornton v.\r\nTrident Med. Ctr., LLC, 357 S.C. 91, 96, 592 S.E.2d 50, 52 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n(finding it was proper to \"focus upon what the terms of the contract specifically\r\nrequire for performance in determining whether interstate commerce [was]\r\n\ninvolved\"). \"There is a strong presumption in favor of the validity of arbitration\r\nagreements because of the strong policy favoring arbitration.\" Towles v. United\r\nHealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 37, 524 S.E.2d 839, 844 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n                                           B.\r\n      As an initial matter, Brentwood Homes takes issue with the circuit court's\r\ndecision regarding Terry's affidavit. Specifically, Brentwood Homes contends that\r\nthe court did not consider Terry's affidavit. We find this contention to be without\r\nmerit as the court did in fact consider Terry's affidavit as it noted in the order that it\r\nreviewed \"the affidavits submitted at [the] hearing and attachments thereto.\"\r\n\r\n                                           C.\r\n      Turning to our assessment of whether the transaction involved interstate\r\ncommerce, we must examine the terms of the Agreement, the Complaint, and the\r\nsurrounding facts, which includes the affidavits of Terry and Bradley as well as\r\naccompanying financial documentation.\r\n\r\n       Based on this evidence, Brentwood Homes claims it established that the\r\narbitration provision in the Agreement is enforceable under the FAA as the\r\ntransaction involved interstate commerce. In support of this claim, Brentwood\r\nHomes relies on the following: (1) the terms of the Agreement, which specify that\r\na national warranty company will be used to provide a structural warranty for\r\nBradley's home and that any claims under the warranty will be submitted to an\r\noffice in Georgia; (2) Terry's affidavit, which establishes that Bradley's residence\r\nwas constructed using materials, subcontractors, and suppliers from outside of\r\nSouth Carolina; and (3) Bradley's affidavit, which indicates that he received\r\nfinancing for the home purchase from a North Carolina lender.\r\n\r\n       The analysis of this issue necessarily involves a discussion of the historical\r\nintrastate character of real estate transactions. Beginning in 1994, this Court\r\nrecognized the unique nature of real estate transactions when it issued its decision\r\nin Mathews v. Fluor Corp., 312 S.C. 404, 440 S.E.2d 880 (1994), overruled on\r\nother grounds by Munoz v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 539 n.3, 542\r\nS.E.2d 360, 363 n.3 (2001) (overruling Mathews \"to the extent it considered\r\nwhether the parties contemplated interstate commerce as a factor in determining if\r\nthe FAA applied\"). In Mathews, this Court held that interstate commerce was not\r\ninvolved in a contract for the sale of a commercial building located in South\r\nCarolina to out-of-state parties even though, incidental to the sale, the parties\r\n\nutilized the services of a North Carolina engineer and procured financing from a\r\nPennsylvania lender. Id. at 407, 440 S.E.2d at 881. In so ruling, the Court found\r\nthe transaction was outside the scope of the FAA because it was \"unable to discern\r\nfrom the evidence presented whether the contract required respondent to\r\nadminister anything related to interstate commerce.\" Id. at 407, 440 S.E.2d at 882.\r\n\r\n       This Court has continued to adhere to the view that the development of real\r\nestate is an inherently intrastate transaction. See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 595, 553\r\nS.E.2d at 117-18 (\"The development of land within South Carolina borders is the\r\nquintessential example of a purely intrastate activity.\").\r\n\r\n       Because the precise question presented in the instant case has not yet been\r\naddressed by our appellate courts, we have looked to other jurisdictions for\r\nguidance. We find the case of Saneii v. Robards, 289 F. Supp. 2d 855 (W.D. Ky.\r\n2003) to be instructive. In Saneii, the purchasers of a home in Kentucky brought a\r\nclaim alleging the home vendors fraudulently induced them into the contract to\r\npurchase the home by misrepresenting and concealing defects. Id. at 857. The\r\nsales and purchase agreement contained a binding arbitration clause generally used\r\nby the Kentucky Real Estate Commission. Id. The purchasers argued that the\r\narbitration clause was not enforceable under Kentucky law, which excludes from\r\narbitration issues involving a determination of whether the making of the\r\nagreement itself involved fraud. Id. at 858. The district court was left to determine\r\nwhether the FAA preempted this state law. Id. Specifically, the court considered\r\nwhether the contract for the sale of residential real estate is \"'a transaction\r\ninvolving interstate commerce' within the meaning of § 2 of the FAA.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      Ultimately, the court concluded that \"a residential real estate sales contract\r\ndoes not evidence or involve interstate commerce.\" Id. at 860. In reaching this\r\nconclusion, the court explained:\r\n\r\n              Notwithstanding its congenial effects on interstate commerce,\r\n      the sale of residential real estate is inherently intrastate. Contracts\r\n      strictly for the sale of residential real estate focus entirely on a\r\n      commodity--the land--which is firmly planted in one particular state.\r\n      The citizenship of immediate parties (the buyer and the seller) or their\r\n      movements to or from that state are incidental to the real estate\r\n      transaction. Those movements are not part of the transaction itself.\r\n      All of the legal relationships concerning the land are bound by state\r\n      law principles. Single residential real estate transactions of this type\r\n      have no substantial or direct connection to interstate commerce. For\r\n\n      all these reasons, logic suggests that such transactions are not among\r\n      those considered as involving interstate commerce.\r\n\r\n             To characterize a residential real estate [transaction] as\r\n      involving interstate commerce under these circumstances would\r\n      actually promote a lack of uniformity in the law, which is exactly\r\n      contrary to one of the FAA's stated purpose. If the FAA applied to\r\n      out-of-state purchasers of Kentucky real estate, different rules would\r\n      apply in that considerable volume of transactions concerning property\r\n      here. Applying Kentucky law to all Kentucky real estate transactions\r\n      creates a more uniform and, therefore, a more equitable body of law.\r\n\r\nId. at 858-59 (footnote omitted); see also Garrison v. Palmas Del Mar\r\nHomeowners Ass'n, 538 F. Supp. 2d 468, 473 (D. P.R. 2008) (discussing Mathews\r\nand Saneii and stating, \"The FAA generally does not apply to residential real estate\r\ntransactions that have no substantial or direct connection to interstate commerce,\r\nregardless of whether said transactions involve out-of-state purchasers.\").\r\n\r\n       Applying the above-outlined principles to the facts of the instant case, we\r\nfind the circuit court correctly determined that the Agreement was not subject to\r\nthe FAA. We agree with the circuit court's conclusion that Brentwood Homes\r\nfailed to satisfy its burden of proof as none of the factors relied upon to establish\r\nthe involvement of interstate commerce negate the intrastate nature of the sale and\r\npurchase of residential real estate.\r\n\r\n      Initially, as its title reflects, the Home Purchase Agreement specifically\r\nprovides that Bradley agreed to purchase a completed dwelling rather than contract\r\nfor the construction of a dwelling. Notably, the provisions of the Agreement\r\nproviding for \"New Construction,\" \"House Plan,\" \"Options,\" and \"Color\r\nSelection,\" are eliminated as \"N/A\" and were not signed by Bradley. Therefore,\r\nwe find Terry's affidavit is inapposite as his attestation that out-of-state materials,\r\nsuppliers, and subcontractors were used for the construction of the residence has no\r\nbearing on the purchase of the completed dwelling.8\r\n\r\n8 We emphasize that had the Agreement actually encompassed the construction of\r\nthe residence, it would have been subject to the FAA as our appellate courts have\r\nconsistently recognized that contracts for construction are governed by the FAA.\r\nSee, e.g., Episcopal Hous. Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 269 S.C. 631, 640, 239 S.E.2d\r\n647, 652 (1977) (holding that performance required under a contract for the\r\nconstruction of an eighteen-story building involved interstate commerce because\r\n\n       Furthermore, neither the inclusion of the national warranty nor Bradley's use\r\nof out-of-state financing converted the intrastate transaction into one involving\r\ninterstate commerce. Significantly, Bradley did not name the national warranty\r\ncompany as a defendant in his lawsuit as his claims involved fraud, negligence,\r\nand breach of an implied warranty and not a claim under the 2-10 HBW Warranty.\r\nBradley's use of a North Carolina branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank & Co., a\r\nnational financial institution, also did not bring the sale of the home within\r\ninterstate commerce as the use of this lender was tangential to the performance of\r\nthe Agreement. See Saneii, 289 F. Supp. 2d at 859 n.3 (noting that the \"tangential\r\neffect\" of a home buyer obtaining financing from a bank, which happened to\r\nparticipate interstate commerce, was not enough to bring the sale of a home within\r\ninterstate commerce and the FAA).\r\n\r\n       Finally, if the utilization of out-of-state financing or a national warranty was\r\nsufficient to constitute interstate commerce, then every transaction that involved\r\nthese ancillary factors would be subject to the FAA. We believe a decision to this\r\neffect would eviscerate the well-established real estate exception to the FAA.\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Brentwood Homes failed to offer\r\nsufficient evidence that the transaction involved interstate commerce to subject the\r\nAgreement to the FAA.9           III. Conclusion\r\n\r\n      Because the essential character of the Agreement was strictly for the\r\npurchase of a completed residential dwelling and not the construction, we find the\r\nFAA does not apply as these types of transactions have historically been deemed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\"[i]t would be virtually impossible to construct\" such a building \"with materials,\r\nequipment and supplies all produced and manufactured solely within the State of\r\nSouth Carolina\"); New Hope Missionary Baptist Church v. Paragon Builders, 379\r\nS.C. 620, 626-27, 667 S.E.2d 1, 4 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding contract for\r\nconstruction of a church pertained to a transaction \"involving interstate commerce\r\ndue to the nature of the construction project\" and the builders' affidavit swearing\r\nthe project would involve businesses and supplies from outside of South Carolina).\r\n9 In light of our holding, we need not address Bradley's argument that Brentwood\r\nHomes waived its right to assert its claim for arbitration. See Futch v.

Respondent admits he failed to file the appeal despite\r\nthe request and asserts his failure to file the appeal was an inadvertent error.\r\nRespondent later assisted Complainant A in obtaining a belated review of the order\r\ndenying Complainant A's PCR action.    Matter II\r\n\r\nComplainant B retained respondent to probate her husband's estate. Respondent\r\nadmits that he failed to diligently pursue the probate of the estate.

Johnson (Employee) sustained an injury to\r\nher back while working for Rent-A-Center (Employer). Employer contends the\r\nAppellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel)\r\nerred in awarding benefits to Employee. The Appellate Panel found Employee was\r\ndisabled and did not constructively refuse light duty work. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEmployee is a single mother living with her son. Employee has a high school\r\ndegree and attended two and one half years of college. Employee's employment\r\nhistory includes a stint as an auditor scanning boxes for UPS for approximately\r\nnine months following high school, working as a waitress for eight years and\r\nworking as a correctional officer for three and one half years. She had no reported\r\nchest, neck or shoulder injuries prior to beginning employment with Employer in\r\nSeptember 2008.\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 2008, while moving a bedroom set from the back of a truck,\r\nEmployee was struck by a dresser weighing over 200 pounds. The dresser fell on\r\nEmployee when a co-worker who was assisting with the move became distracted.\r\nEmployee injured her neck, shoulders and chest. Following the accident,\r\nEmployee received medical treatment from Dr. Paul DeHoll, an orthopaedist\r\nauthorized by Employer's insurance carrier to examine Employee. Dr. DeHoll\r\nplaced Employee on work restriction and instructed her not to lift more than ten\r\npounds or push, pull, stand, climb, walk or sit for long duration. When Employee\r\nattempted to return to work, Employer's district manager informed Employee that\r\nshe could not return until she received a full release with no restrictions from Dr.\r\nDeHoll. For a number of weeks, Employer paid Employee total disability benefits.\r\nDuring this period, Employee obtained her certification as both a licensed Certified\r\nNurse Assistant (CNA) and a phlebotomist.1\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 2008, Dr. DeHoll reported that Employee was \"at maximal medical\r\nimprovement\" and could be \"released back to work with no restrictions.\" Dr.\r\nDeHoll further found that Employee qualified for a \"5% impairment of the whole\r\nperson secondary to the cervical spine,\" and noted that she still complained of\r\ntingling and numbness in both hands.\r\n\r\nAfter being released to full duty, Employee was offered her previous position with\r\nEmployer in Manning but refused the position because she would have been paired\r\nwith the same co-worker whom she faulted for the accident. Employer then\r\noffered Employee a second position in Florence, which she also refused because\r\nEmployer would not offer additional compensation for the extra transportation and\r\nchild care costs she would incur working so far from home. Employee then\r\nresigned from her job and sought other gainful employment.\r\n\r\n1   A phlebotomist is a professional trained to draw blood for tests or transfusions.\r\n\nFollowing her resignation, Employee worked as a housekeeper for Angelic Place\r\nRetirement Home in Sumter for several months. She then changed jobs and\r\nworked at Visiting Professionals, a home health care agency in Sumter, performing\r\ncooking and cleaning duties for one month. In October 2008, Employee began\r\nworking as a CNA with Kershaw County Medical Center. She continued working\r\nas a CNA until her supervisors became aware of her workers' compensation award.\r\nThe Kershaw County Medical Center then informed Employee that, despite her\r\nprevious full duty release letter from Dr. DeHoll, she could not return to work\r\nunless she was reexamined and submitted a new letter.\r\n\r\nOn September 25, 2009, Employee and Employer entered into a consent order\r\nallowing Employee to be reexamined by Dr. DeHoll.2 On October 20, 2009, after\r\nthe examination, Dr. DeHoll noted:\r\n\r\n      \"[T]he Patient still had a small disc herniation as per her previous\r\n      MRI. Essentially there is no change [,] [and] if patient's symptoms\r\n      have resolved[,] I see no need for further action.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 28, 2009, Employee's attorney scheduled an independent medical\r\nevaluation with Dr. Don Johnson. Employee testified that the numbness and\r\ntingling in her hands, which Dr. DeHoll noted in July 2008, had increased in\r\nintensity. Based on his examination, Dr. Johnson diagnosed Employee as suffering\r\ncervical pathology with large disc herniation. Dr. Johnson opined, \"I think this\r\npatient should be placed on lifting restrictions and should not return to work as a\r\nCNA [, but] . . . can work as a phlebotomist . . . .\"\r\n\r\nOn May 26, 2010, Employee filed a Form 50 hearing request with the Workers'\r\nCompensation Commission. On June 3, 2010, the Single Commissioner ordered\r\nDr. Randall G. Drye to examine Employee. On March 22, 2010, Dr. Drye stated\r\nthat Employee \"presents with long-standing chronic symptoms of neck pain and\r\npossible paresthesias,\" and ordered a repeat cervical MRI. After examining the\r\ndata, Dr. Drye concluded, \"I [ ] feel she should adhere to permanent lifting\r\nrestrictions of no greater than 15 pounds. She should not push or pull more than 50\r\npounds and only then on an occasional basis.\" However, he agreed with Dr.\r\nJohnson that Employee was \"well suited to work as a phlebotomist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Neither the Record nor the briefs shed light on the events that took place between\r\nEmployee leaving her job at Kershaw County Medical Center and Employee\r\nentering into a consent order with Employer.\r\n\nAfter examining the medical evidence and testimony, the Single Commissioner\r\nawarded Employee temporary total disability benefits, finding the full duty release\r\nof Dr. DeHoll dated July 15, 2008, was \"stale,\" and the medical evidence\r\nsupported Dr. Johnson and Dr. Drye's conclusions. The Single Commissioner\r\nfurther concluded that Employer did not offer Employee work within the\r\nrestrictions set forth by Dr. Johnson and Dr. Drye. Moreover, he found Employee\r\napplied to numerous phlebotomist positions, but that many of these positions\r\ncombined CNA and phlebotomist responsibilities, rendering the jobs unsuitable for\r\nEmployee. Employer appealed the Single Commissioner's decision to the\r\nAppellate Panel, and the Appellate Panel affirmed. Employer appealed to the court\r\nof appeals, and this Court certified the case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\nISSUESI.     Whether the Appellate Panel erred in finding Employee was\r\n             disabled under section 42-1-120 of the South Carolina Code.\r\n\r\n      II.    Whether the Appellate Panel erred in finding Employee did not\r\n             constructively refuse light duty by voluntarily resigning from\r\n             her position with Employer.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs appeals from the\r\ndecisions of an administrative agency. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380 (Supp. 2011);\r\nLark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134–35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Under the\r\nAPA, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to\r\nthe weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may reverse when the\r\ndecision is affected by an error of law. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(5). If the\r\nfindings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are \"clearly erroneous\r\nin view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record,\" a\r\nreviewing court may reverse or modify. Id. Substantial evidence is not a mere\r\nscintilla of evidence, nor evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is\r\nevidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds\r\nto reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached. Pratt v. Morris\r\nRoofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).\r\n\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Disability under Section 42-1-120\r\nEmployer claims that Employee is not disabled, as defined under section 42-1-120\r\nof the South Carolina Code, and does not qualify for temporary total disability\r\nbenefits. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-120 (1976). We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-1-120 defines \"disability\" as \"incapacity because of injury to earn\r\nwages, which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any\r\nother employment.\" In Shealy v. Algernon Blair, Inc., 250 S.C. 106, 113, 156\r\nS.E.2d 646, 649–50 (1967), the Court found that a worker was not disabled under\r\nsection 42-1-120 because his efforts to obtain work were \"intermittent and\r\nlackadaisical\" and medical evidence, as well as evidence of his post-injury\r\nactivities, demonstrated that he could perform his job. Shealy places the burden on\r\na claimant to show that (1) the claimant \"failed [to obtain employment] because of\r\nan injury produced handicap,\" and (2) the claimant \"made reasonable efforts to\r\nobtain employment.\" Id.\r\n\r\nEmployer argues that under section 42-1-120 and Shealy, Employee was not\r\ndisabled because she could still work as a phlebotomist. Under the first prong of\r\nShealy, the test is whether Employee failed to obtain employment as a result of\r\ninjuries she suffered at work, not that she could work as a phlebotomist in theory.\r\nWhile both Dr. Johnson and Dr. Drye noted that Employee could work as a\r\nphlebotomist, both doctors also placed lifting restrictions on Employee, and Dr.\r\nJohnson additionally opined that Employee could not work as a CNA because of\r\nher injuries.3 The Single Commissioner then found that phlebotomist and CNA\r\nduties are often combined, rendering even a phlebotomist position unsuitable for\r\nEmployee. The Single Commissioner found Employee's testimony concerning the\r\noverlapping nature of CNA and phlebotomist duties credible, and that, while\r\nEmployee worked at Kershaw County Medical Center as a CNA, she also\r\nperformed phlebotomist work for five months. See Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C.\r\n\r\n3 Dr. Johnson's recommendation is supported by documents in the Record\r\nexplaining the physical demands of a CNA, which could involve \"turning, lifting,\r\n[and] transferring\" patients. Moreover, Employee could not return to her job as a\r\nCNA at Kershaw County Medical Center because she was required to obtain a full\r\nduty release without lifting restrictions.\r\n\n382, 393, 544 S.E.2d 620, 627 (2001) (Generally, a trial judge is in the best\r\nposition to judge the credibility of a witness).\r\n\r\nEmployer, challenges this finding, countering that jobs with exclusively\r\nphlebotomist duties do hypothetically exist. The Record, however, does not\r\ndemonstrate that these jobs are available in Employee's geographical area.4\r\nConsequently, we hold substantial evidence supports the Single Commissioner's\r\nfindings that reasonable minds can reach the conclusion that Employee's injuries\r\nprevent her from obtaining employment as a phlebotomist because phlebotomist\r\nand CNA duties are often coterminous. Pratt, 357 S.C. at 622, 594 S.E.2d at 274.\r\nWe stress that our opinion is a narrow one, limited to the facts of this case. Where\r\nit is demonstrated that there are phlebotomist jobs without CNA duties within a\r\nreasonable geographical area, and Employee chooses not to apply for them, the\r\nresult would likely be different.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Employee has satisfied the second prong of Shealy. 250 S.C. at 113,\r\n156 S.E.2d at 649–50. Employee testified in court that she submitted applications\r\nto McLeod Medical Center, Clarendon Memorial Hospital, Colonial Life Center,\r\nAmnesty, and Providence Baptist in Columbia for phlebotomist positions, but did\r\nnot receive any offers.5 Again, the Single Commissioner found Employee's\r\ntestimony credible. In addition, Employee's employment record both before and\r\nafter her injuries does not demonstrate a history of malingering. To the contrary,\r\nEmployer originally refused to allow Employee to return to work without a full\r\nclearance from Dr. DeHoll, necessitating her receipt of temporary total disability\r\nbenefits. Rather than sit idly by, Employee returned to school and received her\r\nCNA and phlebotomist certifications. After Employee resigned her position with\r\nEmployer, she immediately sought and worked at three other jobs before Kershaw\r\nCounty Medical Center suspended her over concerns she could not perform the\r\nduties of a CNA due to her injuries. As Employee testified, \"It's not the fact that I\r\n\r\n4If these jobs do exist, we believe it would not be enough just to show that a\r\nphlebotomist job description formally does not mention CNA or lifting duties, but\r\nEmployer would need to also show that Employee is not expected to informally\r\nperform such duties.\r\n5 Employer complains that Employee did not \"offer any evidence, including\r\napplications, rejections letters, or witnesses, to establish she was denied work as a\r\nphlebotomist . . . .\" However, when Employer cross-examined Employee on this\r\nissue, Employee offered to obtain copies of her applications, but Employer never\r\nfollowed up on this offer.\r\n\ndon't want to work, there's no work out there for me.\" Therefore, we find\r\nsubstantial evidence establishes that Employee exerted reasonable efforts to seek\r\nemployment as a phlebotomist.\r\n\r\nThus, we hold Employee is disabled pursuant to section 42-1-120 of the South\r\nCarolina Code.\r\n\r\nII. Constructive Refusal of Light Duty\r\nEmployer contends Employee constructively refused light duty work that would\r\naccommodate her physical restrictions by voluntarily resigning from her\r\nemployment without giving Employer the opportunity to offer her such work. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nEmployer cites no precedent in which this Court recognized that a constructive\r\nrefusal of light duty could defeat a claim for temporary total disability. Assuming\r\nfor the sake of analysis that such a defense is viable, we find the Record does not\r\nsupport Employer's argument.\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed that Employer never actually offered light duty work to Employee.\r\nRather, Employer offered Employee her previous position where she would be\r\npaired with the co-worker whom she faulted for the accident, and alternatively,\r\noffered her a position necessitating expensive travel on Employee's part.\r\nEmployee refused both offers and resigned. Employer relies on this voluntary\r\nresignation to argue Employee constructively refused light duty work. However,\r\nthese facts do not support Employer's position. To begin with, Employee had a full\r\nrelease from Dr. DeHoll at the time she resigned so the question of light duty work\r\nwas not even an issue, and Employee left for other reasons. Moreover, it is highly\r\nspeculative to presume Employer would offer Employee light duty work had she\r\nremained with Employer. See State v. Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620, 625, 677 S.E.2d\r\n603, 605 (2009) (finding mere speculation insufficient). The Record, in fact,\r\npoints the other way. When Employee was first placed on lifting restrictions by\r\nDr. DeHoll, rather than accommodate Employee, Employer refused to let\r\nEmployee return to work at all. Employee also testified that sometime after she\r\nresigned her position in Manning, she subsequently went back to Employer to ask\r\nfor work, but rather than offer light duty work, Employer turned Employee away\r\non the ground that there was no open position.\r\n\r\nThus, we hold Employer did not offer Employee light duty work, and Employee\r\ndid not constructively refuse such work.\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find Employee qualifies as disabled under section\r\n42-1-120 of the South Carolina Code, and she did not constructively refuse light\r\nduty work. Accordingly, we affirm the Appellate Panel.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice E. C.

Verenes, of Fox & Verenes, of Aiken, for\r\n           Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      JUSTICE HEARN: This case presents us with two issues: (1) whether an\r\nassignee of a note and mortgage has a right to surplus funds generated by the\r\n\nforeclosure of a prior mortgage on the property, and (2) whether that assignee is\r\nbarred from recovering the surplus funds because the note and mortgage assigned\r\nto it allegedly were closed without attorney participation. We hold the assignee\r\nmay recover the surplus funds even though it was not a lienholder of record at the\r\ntime of the sale. We also clarify our decision in Matrix Financial Services Corp. v.\r\nFrazer, 394 S.C. 134, 714 S.E.2d 532 (2011), and hold because the mortgage was\r\nfiled before Matrix, whether it was closed without the services of an attorney\r\nwould not bar the assignee from receiving the surplus funds.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      George Brelsford executed and delivered a promissory note and mortgage\r\n(Mortgage 1) for $30,000 to Citizens Bank of Effingham (Bank) on July 2, 2004.\r\nMortgage 1 was secured by real property in Aiken County and recorded in the\r\nAiken County Register of Mesne Conveyance on July 6, 2004. Brelsford executed\r\nand delivered a second promissory note to Quicken Loans, Inc. on March 21, 2007,\r\nfor the sum of $149,000 and secured payment of this note with a mortgage\r\n(Mortgage 2) in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (Systems)\r\nas nominee for Quicken. Mortgage 2 was secured by the same real property as\r\nMortgage 1 and was duly recorded on April 20, 2007.\r\n\r\n       Brelsford died on August 11, 2009. After determining its loan was in\r\ndefault, Bank foreclosed on the property. Brelsford's estate as well as Systems\r\nwere named as defendants and properly served, but neither responded nor were\r\npresent at the sale, and they were therefore held in default. The property was sold\r\non July 6, 2010 to a third party for the sum of $116,000, which, after satisfying the\r\ndebt to Bank, left $79,405.25 in surplus funds.\r\n\r\n      On July 30, 2010, Systems assigned its note and mortgage to BAC Home\r\nLoan Servicing, L.P., and BAC recorded this assignment on August 20, 2010.\r\nBAC then filed a claim for the surplus funds pursuant to Rule 71(c), SCRCP, and a\r\nhearing was held on October 28, 2010. In the master's original order, he found that\r\nBAC did not have standing to claim the surplusage under Rule 71(c) because it did\r\nnot have \"a lien on the mortgaged premises at the time of sale,\" specifically noting\r\nthat BAC did not have a recorded interest until August 20, 2010, well after the July\r\n6, 2010 sale date. Although arguments were also made that Mortgage 2 was closed\r\nwithout attorney participation in contravention of the law, the master held he did\r\nnot have sufficient evidence to make a ruling on the issue and invited the\r\nsubmission of additional evidence in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion. Pending the\r\n\nsubmission of a Rule 59(e) motion, the master awarded the surplus funds to\r\nBrelsford's estate.\r\n\r\n       BAC made a Rule 59(e) motion arguing that the master erred in barring its\r\nrecovery of the funds because, as an assignee, it was not required to record its\r\nassignment to have a valid claim. Similarly, BAC argued that as an assignee it\r\nreceived all the rights Systems would have had, including the right to request the\r\nsurplus funds. It further contended whether Mortgage 2 was closed by an attorney\r\nwas irrelevant because BAC was not a party to that closing. Finally, BAC argued\r\nthat as a holder in due course of the note underlying the mortgage, it took free from\r\nthe defense that the transaction was illegal.\r\n\r\n       The master disagreed and again held BAC could not claim the surplus funds,\r\nreasoning that Rule 71(c) only allowed claims by those who had a \"lien\" at the\r\ntime of the sale and because the lien on the property was extinguished by the sale,\r\nSystems' assignment of the mortgage to BAC was \"an empty shell, since the lien\r\nno longer existed.\" Also, although no additional evidence was presented, the\r\nmaster concluded that the HUD-1 closing statement, which had been the only\r\nevidence before him at the initial hearing, was proof that no attorney participated\r\nin the closing of Mortgage 2. He therefore held that even if BAC were a holder in\r\ndue course, because Systems would be barred from recovery because of this\r\nillegality, so would BAC. He therefore denied BAC's motion. This appeal\r\nfollowed.                     ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n   I.\t    Did the master err in holding BAC could not recover surplus funds\r\n          because it was not a lienholder of record at the time of the sale?\r\n\r\n   II.\t   Did the master err in holding BAC was barred from recovering surplus\r\n          funds because he found no attorney participated in the closing of\r\n          Mortgage 2?           LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.\t    STATUS AS LIENHOLDER\r\n       BAC first argues the master erred in holding that it could not recover the\r\nsurplus funds from the foreclosure sale because it was not a lienholder of record at\r\nthe time of the sale. We agree.\r\n\n       Rule 71 states, in part, that \"[i]n the event of a surplus fund resulting from\r\nthe sale [on foreclosure], . . . [a]ny party to the action, or any person who had a lien\r\non the mortgaged premises at the time of the sale, . . . may have a hearing to\r\ndetermine [entitlement to the surplus fund].\" Rule 71(c), SCRCP. In the master's\r\noriginal order, he found that because the assignment was not recorded until after\r\nthe sale, BAC did not have a valid \"lien on the mortgaged premises at the time of\r\nsale.\" However, the assignment of a mortgage does not need to be recorded, and\r\nfailure to do so has no effect on the rights of the assignee. Singleton v. Singleton,\r\n60 S.C. 216, 235, 38 S.E. 462, 469 (1901). Therefore the date of recordation of the\r\nassignment has no effect on the transfer of Systems' rights to BAC.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, although the master noted that Systems was a party to the\r\nforeclosure action and had a lien on the subject property, he concluded that the lien\r\nwas terminated by the foreclosure sale and thus the subsequent assignment to BAC\r\n\"was an empty shell, since the lien no longer existed.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 29-3-\r\n780 (2007) (\"Upon . . . a sale of lands pursuant to decree of foreclosure, the officer\r\nof the court making the sale shall cause to be recorded in the office where the\r\nforeclosed mortgage is recorded a release, cancellation, and satisfaction of the\r\nlien.\"). He also found no evidence Systems had \"specifically assigned its right to\r\npursue the surplus funds under Rule 71(c), SCRCP.\" However, the extinguishment\r\nof the lien has no bearing on this case because BAC is not claiming it still has a\r\nlien over the property. Instead, it merely claims an interest in the proceeds from\r\nthe foreclosure sale. The master's ruling ignores the fact that Systems retained the\r\nright to claim the surplus funds pursuant to its original lien and the underlying\r\nnote, and it is this right Systems assigned to BAC. Moreover, in assigning the note\r\nand mortgage, we see no reason why Systems would be required to explicitly\r\nassign the right to surplus funds for BAC to exercise it. An assignee stands in the\r\nshoes of the assignor. Moore v. Weinberg, 373 S.C. 209, 220, 644 S.E.2d 740, 745\r\n(Ct. App. 2007). Thus, an innocent assignee receives all the rights of his assignor.\r\nSingleton, 60 S.C. at 234-35, 38 S.E. at 469. Because Systems could have made\r\nthis claim under Rule 71(c), BAC is entitled to make the same claim. To hold\r\notherwise would ignore settled principles governing assignments.\r\n\r\n   II.    ATTORNEY PARTICIPATION IN CLOSING\r\n       BAC also argues the master erred in finding Mortgage 2 was closed without\r\nattorney supervision which should bar BAC's claims. We find it unnecessary to\r\naddress the factual issue of whether an attorney was present at the closing because\r\neven if one had not been present, our holding in Matrix would allow BAC's claims\r\nto proceed.\r\n\n       In Matrix we reiterated that the closing of a loan without attorney\r\nsupervision constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. Furthermore, we held that\r\nengaging in this unlawful behavior would preclude a lender from obtaining\r\nequitable relief. Id. at 140, 714 S.E.2d at 535. However, in a substitute opinion\r\nissued on rehearing, we explained that this holding would be prospective only,\r\nstating we would \"apply this ruling to all filing dates after the issuance of this\r\nopinion,\" which was August 8, 2011. Id. To the extent some confusion apparently\r\nexists as to what filing date Matrix referred to, we clarify now that it is the date the\r\ndocument a party seeks to enforce was filed. Here, Systems' mortgage was\r\nrecorded on April 20, 2007, well before the issuance of Matrix. Thus, regardless\r\nof whether an attorney participated in the closing of Mortgage 2, BAC would not\r\nbe barred from recovery by the illegality.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we reverse the master's order and award the surplus\r\nfunds to BAC.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27147","title":"SC Farm Bureau v.

The trial court found Kennedy was entitled to UIM coverage\r\nunder the terms of the policy because Kennedy was \"upon\" and thus \"occupying\"\r\nthe insured vehicle at the time of the accident. The Court of Appeals reversed.\r\nS.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, 390 S.C. 125, 700 S.E.2d 258 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2010). We granted Kennedy's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals. We reverse.\r\n\r\nI.    FACTS\r\n\r\n      Kennedy was sent by his employer, Irons Poultry Farms, Inc. (Irons), in his\r\nemployer's truck, to Wise Barbeque, to tell Johnny Wise that Irons had some feed\r\nfor him to pick up. Upon arrival, Kennedy left the keys in his employer's truck and\r\nwent into the restaurant to deliver the message.\r\n\r\n       After delivering the message, Kennedy saw his brother, Teddie Robinson,\r\nand they engaged in a conversation while walking towards the Irons truck. Part of\r\nthe conversation occurred at the rear of the Irons truck. Kennedy and Robinson\r\nfinished their conversation and Robinson prepared to leave. At that moment, an\r\naccident occurred on a nearby highway between two pickup trucks. The impact of\r\nthe collision knocked one of the pickup trucks driven by George Counts into the\r\nrestaurant's parking lot. Counts's truck struck both Robinson and Kennedy as they\r\nattempted to escape the careening vehicle.\r\n\r\n      Kennedy sustained a broken right femur and multiple abrasions, as well as\r\nhead, neck, and back injuries. His combined medical expenses and lost wages\r\nexceeded the liability coverage on Counts's truck. Irons had a Commercial Auto\r\nPolicy with Farm Bureau that covered its truck. The policy provided UIM\r\ncoverage of $50,000 per individual and $100,000 per occurrence. Kennedy sought\r\nUIM coverage under his employer's insurance policy, but Farm Bureau denied\r\ncoverage.\r\n\r\n       Farm Bureau filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a determination\r\nwhether Kennedy was entitled to UIM benefits under the policy. Farm Bureau\r\n(1) disputed whether Kennedy was ever pinned to his employer's vehicle; and\r\n(2) asserted Kennedy was standing by his employer's vehicle and not in actual\r\nphysical contact with it when the accident occurred and, thus, did not meet the\r\npolicy's definition of \"occupying\" the vehicle.\r\n\r\n      Kennedy was initially granted summary judgment. The Court of Appeals\r\nreversed, holding there was a genuine factual dispute regarding whether Kennedy\r\n\nwas ever pinned against his employer's truck, which precluded summary judgment.\r\nS.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, Op. No. 2006-UP-423 (S.C. Ct. App.\r\nfiled Dec. 19, 2006).\r\n\r\n       A bench trial was subsequently held by Judge J. Mark Hayes on the\r\ndeclaratory judgment action. Judge Hayes determined Kennedy was entitled to\r\nUIM benefits. As part of his findings of fact, Judge Hayes found that Kennedy had\r\nleft the engine running on his employer's truck, with a dog inside, and that\r\nKennedy had a brief conversation with Teddie Robinson at the back of the\r\nemployer's truck after performing the errand for his employer. Judge Hayes further\r\nfound that Kennedy \"was in physical contact [with the insured vehicle] prior to the\r\naccident but had removed his hand from the insured vehicle in his efforts to avoid\r\nbeing injured when the other vehicle was about to strike him,\" and that \"the\r\nevidence, especially the medical documentation submitted as to the injuries, clearly\r\nestablished the injuries were consistent as being caused by physical contact with\r\nthe insured vehicle.\"\r\n\r\n       Judge Hayes stated he was reaching this result in light of this Court's\r\nmandate that \"upon\" and \"occupying\" should be construed in favor of the insured,\r\nciting McAbee v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 249 S.C. 96, 152 S.E.2d 731\r\n(1967). Judge Hayes noted the policy at issue in McAbee, like the policy here, did\r\nnot contain any restrictions as to how or in what manner the insured was to be\r\nupon the vehicle.\r\n\r\n       In McAbee, this Court considered a Nationwide insurance policy that\r\nprovided benefits in case of bodily injury or death \"while in or upon, entering or\r\nalighting from\" a motor vehicle. Id. at 99, 152 S.E.2d at 732. The insured was\r\ndriving his employer's truck when he came upon his employer's brother, whose\r\ntractor had broken down, and stopped to help him. Id. at 98, 152 S.E.2d at 731-32.\r\nThe insured, while preparing to leave in the truck, went to the rear of the truck to\r\nremove a chain. Id. at 98, 152 S.E.2d at 732. At that time the tractor began rolling\r\ntoward the rear of the truck where the insured, stooped with his back turned, was\r\nengaged in removing the chain Id. \"[T]he insured straightened up, turned, and\r\nplaced his hands on the tractor with his back against the truck as if trying to stop\r\nthe tractor and keep it from striking him.\" Id. at 98-99, 152 S.E.2d at 732.\r\nHowever, he was crushed to death between the rear of the truck and the front of the\r\ntractor. Id. at 99, 152 S.E.2d at 732.\r\n\r\n       This Court stated it was conceded the insured was not in, entering, or\r\nalighting from the truck, so \"[t]he sole question is whether the insured, while\r\n\nstanding on the ground with his back against the parked truck in an effort to keep\r\nthe tractor from rolling against him, was Upon the truck within the meaning of the\r\npolicy.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       The Court observed that this provision had not previously been construed by\r\nthis Court, and while cases in other jurisdictions are not in complete agreement,\r\n\"the rule seems to be generally recognized that the words 'in or upon' as used in\r\nsuch policy provisions require a broad and liberal construction in favor of the\r\ninsured and that by the weight of authority actual physical contact with the\r\ninsured's automobile is sufficient to establish that the insured was Upon the vehicle\r\nas contemplated by such policies.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      The Court held that the insured was in actual physical contact when he had\r\nhis back against the insured vehicle trying to protect himself and thus was \"upon\" it\r\nwithin the meaning of the policy provision, triggering his entitlement to UIM\r\nbenefits. Id. at 100, 152 S.E.2d at 733.\r\n\r\n       In the current matter before us on appeal, Judge Hayes found Kennedy was\r\nentitled to UIM coverage because he (1) \"was in physical contact with the insured\r\nvehicle at the exact moment of the accident, by virtue of being knocked against it\r\nor pinned to it,\" and (2) \"that the evidence established that [Kennedy] was in\r\nphysical contact [with the insured vehicle] prior to the accident but had removed\r\nhis hand from the insured vehicle in his efforts to avoid being injured when the\r\nother vehicle was about to strike him.\"\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals reversed. The Court of Appeals concluded that\r\nKennedy was not occupying his employer's truck at the time of the accident\r\nbecause \"[h]e had departed the truck, gone inside the restaurant, and returned to the\r\nparking lot to talk with his half-brother near the vehicle when he was hit by the\r\npickup truck. As a result, there was no causal connection between Kennedy's use\r\nof the [employer's] truck and his being struck by Counts'[s] pickup truck.\" S.C.\r\nFarm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, 390 S.C. 125, 139, 700 S.E.2d 258, 266\r\n(Ct. App. 2010). This Court granted Kennedy's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\nII.

LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      Initially, it is noted that the Court of Appeals ignored the trial court's\r\nfindings of fact and substituted its own. Significantly, the Court of Appeals\r\nignored the trial court's findings that Kennedy had physical contact with the\r\ninsured truck until he attempted to escape the impending danger and that Kennedy\r\nalso had actual physical contact as a result of being pinned between the insured\r\nvehicle and Counts's truck. These findings of fact are supported by evidence in the\r\nrecord. Additionally, it appears the Court of Appeals based its decision on a\r\nquestion not raised by the parties, that being whether or not Kennedy was using the\r\ninsured vehicle at the time he was injured. It is undisputed that Kennedy was\r\nperforming an errand for his employer and was preparing to return to the work site\r\nwhen he was struck by Counts.\r\n\r\n         The proper question before the court was whether or not Kennedy had\r\nactual physical contact with the insured truck when he was injured. This was a\r\nquestion of fact for the trial court, which it answered in the affirmative. The\r\nevidence in the record supports the trial court's finding. Farm Bureau attempts to\r\nconvert this question of fact to one of law by arguing a finding of coverage would\r\ncontravene the policy's provisions. Notwithstanding our dispositive \"any\r\nevidence\" standard of review, we will review the policy's provisions in light of the\r\nfacts of this case because it presents a novel question for this Court: Is it\r\nunreasonable to require that actual physical contact be maintained when facing\r\nimpending danger of harm?\r\n\r\n     Part II of Farm Bureau's policy, concerning UIM coverage, provides it will\r\npay UIM benefits to a \"covered person\" as follows:\r\n\r\n             We will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage a\r\n       covered person is legally entitled to collect from the owner or\r\n       operator of an underinsured motor vehicle. The bodily injury or\r\n\n      property damage must be caused by an accident arising out of the\r\n      operation or ownership of the underinsured motor vehicle.\r\n\r\n      A \"covered person\" is defined in Part II as including a \"person occupying\r\nyour [the insured's] covered auto.\" \"Occupying\" appears in the General\r\nDefinitions portion of the policy and \"means having actual physical contact with\r\nan auto while in, upon, entering, or alighting from it.\" Kennedy contended he\r\nwas entitled to UIM coverage because he was \"upon\" the insured vehicle when he\r\nwas injured and thus was \"occupying\" it.\r\n\r\n      On appeal, Kennedy argues that in considering whether he was \"upon\" his\r\nemployer's truck, it should not matter when the physical contact occurs, i.e.,\r\nwhether he was touching the insured vehicle at the time he was crushed by another\r\nvehicle, or whether he was touching it, then ran away for his safety before being\r\npinned back upon it, as in the current appeal. In either circumstance, the insured\r\nwas in physical contact with the insured vehicle and injured.\r\n\r\n      Farm Bureau contends this interpretation would contravene the policy,\r\nwhich provides the physical contact must occur while the individual is \"occupying\"\r\nthe vehicle. Farm Bureau argues Kennedy was not in physical contact with his\r\nemployer's truck when Counts's truck initially hit him, and the fact that he was\r\npushed into the vehicle as a result of the accident does not change his status.\r\n\r\n       Like the Court of Appeals, Farm Bureau erroneously assumes that this\r\naccident begins and ends at the exact moment of contact between the Counts\r\nvehicle and Kennedy. This assumption is flawed because it ignores the unfolding\r\nevents surrounding the accident. The trial court found that Kennedy had physical\r\ncontact with the Irons truck until he was forced to relinquish it in an attempt to\r\nescape injury, and that Kennedy suffered additional injuries when he was pinned\r\nbetween the Irons truck and Counts's truck. The temporal continuum of an\r\naccident necessarily includes more than the point in time of initial impact. It also\r\nincludes the events immediately surrounding the initial impact and the point in\r\ntime that the last injury was inflicted. See Whitmire v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.,\r\n254 S.C. 184, 191, 174 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1970) (observing the party was injured\r\nwhile still engaged in the completion of those acts reasonably to be expected from\r\none acting under similar conditions).\r\n\r\n       In McAbee, although the policy did not require physical contact, there was,\r\nin fact, physical contact between McAbee and his employer's truck when McAbee\r\n\nwas pinned between his employer's truck and a tractor.1 This Court held that\r\nMcAbee's physical contact with his employer's truck would satisfy the definition of\r\n\"upon\" because \"upon\" was not so narrowly defined as to mean only \"on top of.\"\r\nMcAbee, 249 S.C. at 99, 152 S.E.2d at 732. In the current appeal, the trial court\r\nspecifically found that Kennedy \"was in physical contact [with his employer's\r\ninsured vehicle] prior to the accident but had removed his hand from the insured\r\nvehicle in his efforts to avoid being injured when the other vehicle was about to\r\nstrike him.\" This factual finding has not been challenged on appeal, and we\r\nbelieve it establishes the requisite physical contact for UIM coverage under the\r\ncircumstances present here. Moreover, the trial court also found that physical\r\ncontact was established when Kennedy was pinned against the Irons truck. We\r\nagree.As noted in American Jurisprudence, Second Edition, whether a person is\r\ndeemed to have been \"occupying\" a vehicle depends on the facts of each case,\r\nalthough the general trend appears to be in favor of a liberal construction of the\r\nterm \"occupying.\" 7A Am. Jur. 2d Automobile Insurance § 455 (2007).2\r\n\r\n       In this case, Kennedy drove his employer's truck to the restaurant, where he\r\nleft the keys in the truck with the engine running and a dog inside while he went\r\ninside the building. Shortly thereafter he returned to the parking lot, where he was\r\nstanding with his hand on the vehicle when he saw the approaching danger and\r\nattempted to flee before immediately being struck and injured by Counts's truck.\r\nThus, Kennedy was in physical contact with his employer's vehicle immediately\r\nprior to being struck by Counts's vehicle. The fact that Kennedy had engaged in a\r\n\r\n1 The McAbee court ostensibly believed that it made no difference when the\r\nphysical contact occurred because it did not address whether McAbee first came in\r\nphysical contact with the tractor or with the insured truck.\r\n2 See Jonathan M. Purver, Annotation, Automobile Insurance: When is a Person\r\n\"Occupying\" an Automobile Within Meaning of Medical Payments Provision, 42\r\nA.L.R.3d 501 (1972 & Supp. 2011) (discussing cases where the claimant was\r\ninjured while in various situations: alighting from the vehicle, with his or her body\r\npartly in the vehicle, reaching into the vehicle, standing near the vehicle, placing\r\nan object into the trunk, leaning against the vehicle, etc.); R.P. Davis, Annotation,\r\nScope of Clause of Insurance Policy Covering Injuries Sustained While \"in or on\"\r\nor \"upon\" Motor Vehicle, 39 A.L.R.2d 952, at § 4 (1955 & Later Case Service\r\n2005) (evaluating \"in or upon\" and whether the injured person had physical contact\r\nwith the vehicle immediately prior to the injury).\r\n\nconversation at the rear of the truck is not important. Holding a conversation\r\noutside of an automobile is commonplace and is to be expected in the ordinary use\r\nof a vehicle.\r\n\r\n       Kennedy argues Farm Bureau's interpretation of the policy, which would\r\ndeny coverage here while allowing it in a case like McAbee, where the individual\r\nwas bracing himself against his employer's truck when he was crushed by a tractor,\r\nwould be an \"unreasonable\" distinction that would unfairly deny him UIM\r\nbenefits. We agree that requiring Kennedy to keep his hand upon the vehicle,\r\nremain in the path of Counts's oncoming vehicle, and risk being crushed is\r\nunreasonable, unconscionable, and not in accordance with the legislative purpose\r\nbehind enactment of the UIM statute. See S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-160 (2002)\r\n(stating automobile insurance \"carriers shall . . . offer . . . underinsured motorist\r\ncoverage up to the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage in\r\nthe event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an\r\nat-fault insured or underinsured motorist or in excess of any damages cap or\r\nlimitation imposed by statute\"); Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253,\r\n260, 626 S.E.2d 6, 10 (2005) (\"The central purpose of the UIM statute is to provide\r\ncoverage when the injured party's damages exceed the liability limits of the at-fault\r\nmotorist. The UIM and UM statutes are remedial in nature and enacted for the\r\nbenefit of injured persons; therefore, they should be construed liberally to effect\r\nthe purpose intended by the Legislature.\" (citation omitted)); see also O'Neill v.\r\nSmith, 388 S.C. 246, 254-55, 695 S.E.2d 531, 535-36 (2010) (observing under\r\nSouth Carolina law, carriers must offer UIM coverage up to the limits of the\r\ninsured's liability coverage, and the purpose of the UIM statute is to provide to an\r\ninsured who is an injured claimant the same benefit level as that provided by the\r\ninsured to those asserting claims against the insured (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n       To interpret the physical contact requirement in a manner that would require\r\nKennedy to succumb to the approaching danger rather than relinquish physical\r\ncontact would be unreasonable and unconscionable. Kennedy's conduct was\r\nreasonably to be expected from one acting under similar circumstances when faced\r\nwith a hazard encountered in the ordinary use of a vehicle. See Whitmire v.\r\nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 254 S.C. 184, 191, 174 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1970) (holding\r\nwhere the plaintiff was struck within two or three feet of the automobile while\r\nrunning to attempt to escape an imminent impact with an oncoming vehicle, the\r\nplaintiff was still \"alighting from\" the automobile because the \"meaning [of a\r\npolicy term] must be related to the particular use of the automobile and the hazards\r\nto be encountered from such use\"; the Court found \"[i]t is reasonable to conclude\r\nthat coverage was intended to protect a guest against the hazards from passing\r\n\nvehicles in the vicinity, while the guest . . . is still engaged in the completion of\r\nthose acts reasonably to be expected from one . . .

Farm Bureau Mut.\r\nIns. Co., 201 N.W.2d 786, 791 (Mich. 1972) (\"It would be unconscionable to\r\npermit an insurance company offering statutorily required coverage to collect\r\npremiums for it with one hand and allow it to take the coverage away with the\r\nother by using a self-devised [] limitation.

Zupanec, Annotation, Doctrine of\r\nUnconscionability as Applied to Insurance Contracts, 86 A.L.R.3d 862, 872 (1978\r\n& Supp. May 2012)); 8 Richard A.

Cos. v. Citizens Ins. Co., 43 A.3d\r\n56, 60 (R.I. 2012).\r\n\r\n       Moreover, in Chavez v. Arizona School Risk Retention Trust, Inc., 258 P.3d\r\n145 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011), the Court of Appeals of Arizona recently questioned the\r\nvalidity of a policy provision limiting occupying to \"being in or being in physical\r\ncontact with a covered Automobile, including while getting into or getting out of\r\nthat covered Automobile.\" Id. at 148. It stated, \"Courts 'will not interline the UM\r\n[(uninsured motorist)] and UIM statutes to permit exclusions that have not been\r\n                                \r\nmentioned by the legislature.'\" Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Taylor v.\r\nTravelers Indem. Co. of Am., 9 P.3d 1049, 1057 (Ariz. 2000)). The court also cited\r\nthe principle that coverage must be in conformance with that contemplated by the\r\nassociated statute: \"Exclusions and limitations on coverage are generally invalid\r\nunless contemplated by the statute.\" Id. (quoting Lowing v. Allstate Ins. Co., 859\r\nP.2d 724, 727 (Ariz. 1993)).\r\n\n        In another case involving a physical contact requirement, the Appellate\r\nCourt of Illinois questioned the validity of the provision in dispute, which defined\r\n\"occupying\" to require physical contact for UM and UIM coverage, but not for\r\nliability coverage, as the legislative intent was to provide UM and UIM coverage at\r\na level at least equal to that in the insured's liability coverage. DeSaga v. West\r\nBend Mut. Ins. Co., 910 N.E.2d 159, 167 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009). The court found\r\nthat, even if the questioned definition were allowed to stand, under \"the unique\r\nfacts of this particular case,\" the driver was in \"virtual physical contact\" with his\r\nvehicle where he had left the engine running and turned on his flashers before\r\nexiting the vehicle to remove nearby debris from the roadway. Id. at 167-68.\r\n\r\n       Although we are likewise concerned about the ultimate validity of such\r\ndefinitional provisions3 and whether they alter, or conflict with, the statutory\r\ndefinition of an insured,4 that issue was not raised to the trial court nor on appeal to\r\n\r\n3 Requiring physical contact for all methods of \"occupying\" a vehicle could render\r\nsome terms of coverage meaningless, arguably creating illusory coverage. For\r\nexample, in Whitmire, 254 S.C. at 191, 174 S.E.2d at 394, this Court observed that\r\nthe phrase \"[a]lighting from\" of necessity \"must [] extend to a situation where the\r\nbody has reached a point when there is no contact with the vehicle.\" (Emphasis\r\nadded.) The Court explained that, \"[i]f the phrase 'alighting from' is limited to the\r\nphysical act of descending from the automobile, it would be meaningless because a\r\nperson would still be in contact with it and within the coverage afforded under the\r\nterms 'in' or 'upon'.\" Id. Farm Bureau's actual physical contact requirement\r\narguably eliminates coverage when alighting from a vehicle.\r\n4 S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-30(7) (2002) defines an insured as follows: \"'Insured'\r\n                                                                             \r\nmeans the named insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse of\r\nany named insured and relatives of either, while in a motor vehicle or otherwise,\r\nand any person who uses with the consent, expressed or implied, of the named\r\ninsured the motor vehicle to which the policy applies and a guest in the motor\r\nvehicle to which the policy applies or the personal representative of any of the\r\nabove.\" (Emphasis added.) There is no requirement of actual physical contact\r\nwith the insured vehicle at the time of injury to qualify as an insured under the\r\nstatute. If \"actual physical contact\" is required, then the phrase \"in a vehicle or\r\notherwise\" appears meaningless. The only statutory limitation is that a non-\r\nresident relative and others must have the consent of the named insured to use the\r\nvehicle. Consent to use the vehicle bestows the same level of coverage upon\r\nothers as that enjoyed by the named insured. The statutory definition cannot be\r\nlimited by a contractual provision. Cf. Boyd v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 260\r\n\nthis Court. Therefore, we offer no formal opinion in this regard as the issue is not\r\nbefore us. Rather, we find Kennedy met the physical contact requirement here\r\nbecause it would be unreasonable and unconscionable to interpret the provision to\r\nrequire a party who had physical contact with a vehicle to maintain that contact\r\nunder circumstances that might result in catastrophic injury. Consequently, we\r\nagree with the trial court that Kennedy was \"upon\" the insured vehicle and met the\r\nrequirements for UIM coverage. Cf. C & J Fertilizer, Inc. v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co.,\r\n227 N.W.2d 169 (Iowa 1975) (holding even though the definition of \"burglary\" in\r\nthe insurance policies required the exterior of the premises to bear visible marks of\r\nforce and violence, and only an interior door of the insured's warehouse was\r\ndamaged during a burglary, the liability-avoiding provision in the definition was,\r\nunder the circumstances of the case, unconscionable and constituted no bar to\r\nrecovery).\r\n\r\nIV.   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       Initially, we conclude that the trial court's finding of actual physical contact\r\nis supported by the evidence. Under the sequence of events that unfolded here,\r\nwhere the trial court found Kennedy had left the engine running on his employer's\r\nvehicle, and that he was in physical contact with the covered vehicle (with his hand\r\non the truck) when Counts's vehicle careened towards him, forcing him to\r\nrelinquish his contact in order to attempt to avoid injury, that Kennedy was \"upon\"\r\nand \"occupying\" the vehicle at the time of the accident and he is entitled to UIM\r\ncoverage under the Farm Bureau policy. Moreover, a second, resultant physical\r\ncontact was established when Kennedy was pinned against the insured vehicle.\r\nWe further conclude that a requirement that an insured remain in physical contact\r\nwith the insured vehicle in the face of imminent danger is unreasonable and\r\nunconscionable. Consequently, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. 316, 319, 195 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1973) (\"It is settled law that statutory\r\nprovisions relating to an insurance contract are part of the contract, and that a\r\npolicy provision which contravenes an applicable statute is to that extent invalid.\");\r\nPotomoc Ins.

Co., 254 S.C. 107, 173 S.E.2d 653 (1970)\r\n(holding exclusionary policy language, whether it constituted an attempt to\r\nredefine the term \"insured\" in contravention of insurance statutes or to afford only\r\nconditional or contingent coverage, as opposed to the full coverage required by\r\nstatutory law, was invalid as it was not in accordance with the state's financial\r\nresponsibility law).\r\n\n     REVERSED.\r\n\r\n     Acting Justices James E.

The policy\r\ndefines \"occupying\" as \"having actual physical contact with an auto while in, upon,\r\nentering, or alighting from it.\" In my opinion, there is no dispute that petitioner\r\nwas not \"in actual physical contact\" with the truck when the accident occurred.\r\nUnlike the majority, I am unable to agree that an accident continues until the last\r\ninjury is inflicted. Under this theory, in virtually every case where the victim\r\neventually makes contact with an insured vehicle, whether he was thrown, dragged\r\nor carried across the parking lot by another vehicle, there would be coverage.\r\nSuch an expansive reading renders meaningless the policy language defining\r\n\"occupying\" as “ in, upon, entering, or alighting from” the insured vehicle.\r\n\"[P]arties have the right to make their own contract and it is not the function of this\r\nCourt to rewrite it or torture the meaning of a policy or extend coverage never\r\nintended by the parties.\" Torrington Co. v.

After a four day hearing in September 2011, the family\r\ncourt issued a final order on November 25, 2011, denying the adoption and\r\nrequiring the adoptive parents to transfer the child to her biological father. The\r\ntransfer of custody took place in Charleston, South Carolina, on December 31,\r\n2011, and the child now resides with her biological father and his parents in\r\nOklahoma. We affirm the decision of the family court denying the adoption and\r\nawarding custody to the biological father.\r\n\r\n                         FACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nFather and Mother are the biological parents of a child born in Oklahoma on\r\nSeptember 15, 2009 (\"Baby Girl\"). Father and Mother became engaged to be\r\nmarried in December 2008, and Mother informed Father that she was pregnant in\r\nJanuary 2009.1 At the time Mother became pregnant, Father was actively serving\r\nin the United States Army and stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, approximately four\r\nhours away from his hometown of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where his parents and\r\nMother resided.2 Upon learning Mother was pregnant, Father began pressing\r\n\r\n1Father has a daughter from a prior marriage whom he supports through a\r\ndeduction in his military pay and who was six years old at the time of the\r\nengagement. Mother claims that Father has another daughter whom he does not\r\nsupport, but this was never substantiated by the evidence. Mother has two other\r\nchildren from a prior relationship.\r\n2Father served honorably in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New\r\nDawn and received a Bronze Star for his service. He is now a member of the\r\nNational Guard and works as a security guard.\r\n\nMother to get married sooner.3 The couple continued to speak by phone daily, but\r\nby April 2009, the relationship had become strained. Mother testified she\r\nultimately broke off the engagement in May via text message because Father was\r\npressuring her to get married. At this point, Mother cut off all contact with Father.\r\nWhile Father testified his post-breakup attempts to call and text message Mother\r\nwent unanswered, it appears from the Record Father did not make any meaningful\r\nattempts to contact her.\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed that Mother and Father did not live together prior to the baby's\r\nbirth and that Father did not support Mother financially for pregnancy related\r\nexpenses, even though he had the ability to provide some degree of financial\r\nassistance to Mother.4\r\n\r\nIn June 2009, Mother sent a text message to Father asking if he would rather pay\r\nchild support or surrender his parental rights. Father responded via text message\r\nthat he would relinquish his rights, but testified that he believed he was\r\nrelinquishing his rights to Mother. Father explained: \"In my mind I thought that if\r\nI would do that I'd be able to give her time to think about this and possibly maybe\r\nwe would get back together and continue what we had started.\" However, under\r\ncross-examination Father admitted that his behavior was not conducive to being a\r\nfather. Mother never informed Father that she intended to place the baby up for\r\nadoption. Father insists that, had he known this, he would have never considered\r\nrelinquishing his rights.\r\n\r\nMother testified she chose the adoption route because she already had two children\r\nby another father, and she was struggling financially. In June 2009, Mother\r\n\r\n3 The testimony of Mother and Father surrounding the circumstances of the parties'\r\nrelationship during this time is conflicting. For example, Father testified he was\r\n\"very happy\" when he learned they were expecting a child and claimed he desired\r\nto get married sooner so that the child would not be born out of wedlock. On the\r\nother hand, Mother testified Father \"didn't really have a reaction\" and \"every time\r\n[she] would bring it up, he really didn't say a whole lot,\" and stated Father\r\npressured her to get married for monetary purposes because the military would\r\nincrease his pay for \"family living.\"\r\n4 Mother testified she asked Father for financial assistance before she made her\r\nfirst pre-natal doctor's appointment, and Father stated he would not assist her\r\nfinancially unless they were married. Father denies that Mother asked for financial\r\nassistance and testified he would have supported her if she had asked.\r\n\nconnected with Appellants (or \"Adoptive Mother\" or \"Adoptive Father\") through\r\nthe Nightlight Christian Adoption Agency (the \"Nightlight Agency\"). She testified\r\nshe chose them to be the parents of the child because \"[t]hey're stable . . . . they're a\r\nmother and father that live inside a home where she can look up to them and they\r\ncan give her everything she needs when needed.\"\r\n\r\nAppellants reside in Charleston, South Carolina, and were married on December\r\n10, 2005. Adoptive Mother has a Master's Degree and a Ph.D. in developmental\r\npsychology and develops therapy programs for children with behavior problems\r\nand their families. Adoptive Father is an automotive body technician currently\r\nworking for Boeing. They have no other children. After connecting, Mother\r\nspoke with Appellants weekly by telephone, and Adoptive Mother visited Mother\r\nin Oklahoma in August 2009. Appellants provided financial assistance to Mother\r\nduring the final months of her pregnancy and after Baby Girl's birth. Adoptive\r\nMother testified Mother consistently represented that the birth father was not\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nMother testified that she knew \"from the beginning\" that Father was a registered\r\nmember of the Cherokee Nation, and that she deemed this information \"important\"\r\nthroughout the adoption process.5 Further, she testified she knew that if the\r\nCherokee Nation were alerted to Baby Girl's status as an Indian child, \"some things\r\nwere going to come into effect, but [she] wasn't for [sic] sure what.\" Mother\r\nreported Father's Indian heritage on the Nightlight Agency's adoption form and\r\ntestified she made Father's Indian heritage known to Appellants and every agency\r\ninvolved in the adoption. However, it appears that there were some efforts to\r\nconceal his Indian status. In fact, the pre-placement form reflects Mother's\r\nreluctance to share this information:\r\n\r\n      Initially the birth mother did not wish to identify the father, said she\r\n      wanted to keep things low-key as possible for the [Appellants],\r\n      because he's registered in the Cherokee tribe. It was determined that\r\n      naming him would be detrimental to the adoption.\r\n\r\nAppellants hired an attorney to represent Mother's interests during the adoption.\r\nMother told her attorney that Father had Cherokee Indian heritage. Based on this\r\ninformation, Mother's attorney wrote a letter, dated August 21, 2009, to the Child\r\nWelfare Division of the Cherokee Nation to inquire about Father's status as an\r\n\r\n5 Mother testified that she believed she also had Cherokee heritage, but she was not\r\na registered member of the Cherokee Nation.\r\n\nenrolled Cherokee Indian. The letter stated that Father was \"1/8 Cherokee,\r\nsupposedly enrolled,\" but misspelled Father's first name as \"Dustin\" instead of\r\n\"Dusten\" and misrepresented his birthdate. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nBecause of these inaccuracies, the Cherokee Nation responded with a letter stating\r\nthat the tribe could not verify Father's membership in the tribal records, but that\r\n\"[a]ny incorrect or omitted family documentation could invalidate this\r\ndetermination.\" Mother testified she told her attorney that the letter was incorrect\r\nand that Father was an enrolled member, but that she did not know his correct\r\nbirthdate. Adoptive Mother testified that, because they hired an attorney to\r\nspecifically inquire about the baby's Cherokee Indian status, \"when she was born,\r\nwe were under the impression that she was not Cherokee.\"6 Any information\r\nAppellants had about Father came from Mother.\r\n\r\nWhen Mother arrived at the hospital to give birth, she requested to be placed on\r\n\"strictly no report\" status, meaning that if anyone called to inquire about her\r\npresence in the hospital, the hospital would report her as not admitted.7 Mother\r\ntestified that neither Father nor his parents contacted her while she was in the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nAdoptive Mother and Adoptive Father were in the delivery room when Mother\r\ngave birth to Baby Girl on September 15, 2009. Adoptive Father cut the umbilical\r\ncord. The next morning, Mother signed forms relinquishing her parental rights and\r\nconsenting to the adoption.\r\n\r\nAppellants were required to receive consent from the State of Oklahoma pursuant\r\nto the Oklahoma Interstate Compact on Placement of Children (\"ICPC\") as a\r\nprerequisite to removing Baby Girl from that state. Mother signed the necessary\r\ndocumentation, which reported Baby Girl's ethnicity as \"Hispanic\" instead of\r\n\"Native American.\" After Baby Girl was discharged from the hospital, Appellants\r\nremained in Oklahoma with Baby Girl for approximately eight days until they\r\nreceived ICPC approval, at which point they took Baby Girl to South Carolina.\r\nAccording to the testimony of Tiffany Dunaway, a Child Welfare Specialist with\r\nthe Cherokee Nation, had the Cherokee Nation known about Baby Girl's Native\r\n\r\n6Adoptive Mother testified that the Nightlight Agency's pre-placement report was\r\n\"probably . . . something I read and didn't think twice about it.\"\r\n7 Mother testified that she chose this option in both of her previous births primarily\r\nto prevent the father from contacting her.\r\n\nAmerican heritage, Appellants would not have been able to remove Baby Girl from\r\nOklahoma.8\r\n\r\nFather was aware of Mother's expected due date, but made no attempt to contact or\r\nsupport Mother directly in the months following Baby Girl's birth.9\r\n\r\nAppellants filed the adoption action in South Carolina on September 18, 2009,\r\nthree days after Baby Girl's birth, but did not serve or otherwise notify Father of\r\nthe adoption action until January 6, 2010, approximately four months after Baby\r\nGirl was born and days before Father was scheduled to deploy to Iraq. On that\r\ndate outside of a mall near his base, a process server presented Father with legal\r\npapers entitled \"Acceptance of Service and Answer of Defendant,\" which stated he\r\nwas not contesting the adoption of Baby Girl and that he waived the thirty day\r\nwaiting period and notice of the hearing. Father testified he believed he was\r\nrelinquishing his rights to Mother and did not realize he consented to Baby Girl's\r\nadoption by another family until after he signed the papers. Upon realizing that\r\nMother had relinquished her rights to Appellants, Father testified, \"I then tried to\r\ngrab the paper up. [The process server] told me that I could not grab that [sic]\r\nbecause . . . I would be going to jail if I was to do any harm to the paper.\"\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with his parents and a JAG lawyer at his base, Father contacted a\r\nlawyer the next day, and on January 11, 2010, he requested a stay of the adoption\r\nproceedings under the Servicemember's Civil Relief Act (\"SCRA\"). On January\r\n14, 2010, Father filed a summons and complaint in an Oklahoma district court to\r\n\r\n8 Dunaway testified that had \"Native American\" been circled on the ICPC form,\r\nthe ICPC administrator would have contacted her supervisor directly. Whether or\r\nnot the Cherokee Nation would have ultimately allowed the adoption to go forward\r\nis a matter of tribal law. However, the testimony establishes the tribe would not\r\nhave consented to Baby Girl's removal at that time, triggering the denial of\r\nAppellants' ICPC application, and Appellants would not have been able to\r\ntransport Baby Girl to South Carolina.\r\n9 Father testified he asked friends and family if they had seen Mother because she\r\nwould not reply to his text messages. His mother testified she attempted to contact\r\nMother on several occasions and once left Mother a voice message before Baby\r\nGirl's birth to tell Mother she had money and some gifts for the baby, including\r\nitems she hand-knitted, but Mother never returned her telephone calls. Mother\r\ntestified that none of Father's family members contacted her regarding gifts for\r\nBaby Girl.\r\n\nestablish paternity, child custody, and support of Baby Girl. The complaint named\r\nAppellants and Mother as defendants.10 Paragraph 12 of this Complaint stated,\r\n\"Neither parent nor the children have Native American blood. Therefore the\r\nFederal Indian Child Welfare Act . . . and the Oklahoma Indian Child Welfare Act\r\n. . . do not apply.\" Father departed for Iraq on January 18, 2010, with his father\r\nacting as power of attorney while he was deployed overseas.11\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 2010, Appellants, with Mother joining, filed a Special Appearance\r\nand Motion to Dismiss Father's Oklahoma action on jurisdictional grounds. The\r\nmotion was granted, thereby ending the Oklahoma custody action.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in January 2010, the Cherokee Nation first identified Father as a\r\nregistered member and determined that Baby Girl was an \"Indian Child,\" as\r\ndefined under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1901, et seq. (the\r\n\"ICWA\"). It is not apparent from the Record when Appellants were made aware\r\nof this change, but on March 30, 2010, Appellants amended their South Carolina\r\npleadings to acknowledge Father's membership in the Cherokee Nation.\r\nAccordingly, on April 7, 2010, the Cherokee Nation filed a Notice of Intervention\r\nin the South Carolina action.12\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 2010, the family court ordered paternity testing which conclusively\r\nestablished Father as the biological father of Baby Girl, and Appellants have since\r\nacknowledged Father's paternity. Furthermore, the family court issued an order\r\nconfirming venue and jurisdiction in Charleston County Family Court and lifting\r\nthe automatic stay of proceedings under the SCRA. On May 25, 2010, Father\r\nanswered Appellants' amended complaint, stating he did not consent to the\r\nadoption of Baby Girl and seeking custody. By temporary order dated July 12,\r\n2011, the family court set a hearing date for the case, and found separately that the\r\nICWA applied to the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n Upon receipt of this complaint, Appellants were first put on notice that Father\r\nwas contesting the adoption.\r\n11   Father did not return to the United States until December 26, 2010.\r\n12On April 19, 2010, Father filed an amended complaint that modified paragraph\r\n12 of his previous complaint to read: \"Both the father and the child have Native\r\nAmerican blood. Therefore the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act . . . and the\r\nOklahoma Indian Child Welfare Act . . . do apply.\"\r\n\nThe trial of the case took place from September 12–15, 2011. A Guardian ad\r\nLitem (\"GAL\") represented the interests of Baby Girl. On November 25, 2011, the\r\nfamily court judge issued a Final Order, finding that: (1) the ICWA applied and it\r\nwas not unconstitutional; (2) the \"Existing Indian Family\" doctrine was\r\ninapplicable as an exception to the application of the ICWA in this case in\r\naccordance with the clear modern trend; (3) Father did not voluntarily consent to\r\nthe termination of his parental rights or the adoption; and (4) Appellants failed to\r\nprove by clear and convincing evidence that Father's parental rights should be\r\nterminated or that granting custody of Baby Girl to Father would likely result in\r\nserious emotional or physical damage to Baby Girl. Therefore, the family court\r\ndenied Appellants' petition for adoption and ordered the transfer of custody of\r\nBaby Girl to Father on December 28, 2011.\r\n\r\nAppellants filed a motion to stay the transfer and to reconsider on December 9,\r\n2011, which the family court denied on December 14, 2011.13 Appellants then\r\nfiled a notice of appeal in the court of appeals on December 20, 2011, along with a\r\npetition for a writ of supersedeas. Judge Aphrodite Konduros temporarily granted\r\nthe petition for a writ of supersedeas pending the filing of a return by Father. On\r\nDecember 30, 2011, Judge Konduros issued an order lifting the temporary grant of\r\nsupersedeas and denying the petition for a writ of supersedeas. On December 31,\r\n2011, Appellants transferred Baby Girl to Father, and Father and his parents\r\nimmediately traveled with Baby Girl back to Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThis Court certified the appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. In addition to\r\nbriefs filed by the parties, the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the\r\nCatawba Indian Nation, the North American Council on Adoptable Children, the\r\nChild Welfare League of America, the National Indian Child Welfare Association,\r\nand the Association on American Indian Affairs have filed briefs as amici curiae.\r\n\r\n                                        ISSUES\r\n\r\nI.\t       Whether Appellants properly transferred Baby Girl to South Carolina.\r\n\r\nII.\t      Whether the ICWA defers to state law in determining whether an\r\n          unwed father is a \"parent\" as defined by the ICWA.\r\n\r\nIII.\t Whether Appellants proved grounds to terminate Father's parental\r\n      rights under the ICWA.\r\n\r\n13    The GAL also filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied.\r\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing a decision by the family court, an appellate court has the authority\r\nto find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 384, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651 (2011).\r\n\"However, this broad scope of review does not require this Court to disregard the\r\nfindings of the family court\" judge who is in a superior position to make credibility\r\ndeterminations, nor does it relieve an appellant of demonstrating the error of the\r\nfamily court. Id. at 384, 389, 709 S.E.2d at 651, 654.\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n                                   I.     The ICWA\r\n\r\nThis case is unique in that it involves an Indian child,14 and thus, any child custody\r\nproceeding must be decided within the parameters of the ICWA, 25 U.S.C. §\r\n1901–1963 (1978).\r\n\r\nThe ICWA \"was the product of rising concern in the mid-1970's over the\r\nconsequences to Indian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive child\r\nwelfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of Indian children\r\nfrom their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually in\r\nnon-Indian homes.\" Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 32\r\n(1988). The evidence presented to Congress during the 1974 hearings revealed\r\nthat \"25 to 35% of all Indian children had been separated from their families and\r\nplaced in adoptive families, foster care, or institutions.\" Id. (citation omitted).\r\nMoreover, \"[t]he adoption rate of Indian children was eight times that of non-\r\nIndian children\" and \"[a]pproximately 90% of the Indian placements were in non-\r\nIndian homes.\" Id. at 33 (citation omitted). At the Congressional hearings, a\r\nTribal Chief described the primary reason for such removal as follows:\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious failings of the present system is that Indian children\r\nare removed from the custody of their natural parents by nontribal\r\ngovernment authorities who have no basis for intelligently evaluating the\r\n\r\n14 An \"Indian Child\" is \"any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is\r\neither (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian\r\ntribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\" 25 U.S.C. §\r\n1903(4).\r\n\ncultural and social premises underlying Indian home life and childrearing.\r\nMany of the individuals who decide the fate of our children are at best\r\nignorant of our cultural values, and at worst contemptful of the Indian way\r\nand convinced that removal, usually to a non-Indian household or institution,\r\ncan only benefit an Indian child.\r\n\r\nId. at 34–35 (citation and footnote omitted).15\r\n\r\nAlthough Congress primarily sought to prevent the involuntary removal of\r\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native Indian children from their families and tribal\r\ncommunities and placement of these children into both foster care and adoptive\r\nplacements, see 25 U.S.C. §§ 1912(e)–(f), 1915(b), it is clear that Congress was\r\nlikewise concerned with the voluntary adoptions of Indian children. See 25 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1915(a) (\"In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a\r\npreference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a\r\nplacement with (1) a member of the child's extended family; (2) other members of\r\nthe Indian child's tribe; or (3) other Indian families.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nAside from the avoidance of culturally inappropriate removal of Indian children,\r\nCongress intended the ICWA to preserve tribal sovereignty with respect to its\r\nfamilial affairs. In Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30,\r\n32 (1988), the only United States Supreme Court case addressing the ICWA, the\r\nCourt determined that the Choctaw Indian Tribe had the sole authority to\r\ndetermine the adoptive placement of twin babies under the ICWA. In that case,\r\nboth Indian parents desired to have their twin babies adopted by non-Indian\r\nparents. Id. In construing section 1911(a) of the ICWA, the Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n15For example, non-Indian state child welfare workers often mischaracterize the\r\ndynamics of the Indian extended family:\r\n\r\n      An Indian child may have scores of, perhaps more than a hundred,\r\n      relatives who are counted as close, responsible members of the family.\r\n      Many social workers, untutored in the ways of Indian family life or\r\n      assuming them to be socially irresponsible, consider leaving the child\r\n      with persons outside the nuclear family as neglect and thus as grounds\r\n      for terminating parental rights.\r\n\r\nH.R. Rep. No. 1386, at 22 (1978) reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7530, 7533. At\r\ntrial, the Cherokee Nation presented expert testimony that the involvement of\r\nextended family members in child-rearing is culturally unique to Cherokee Indians.\r\n\n      [n]or can the result be any different simply because the twins were\r\n      \"voluntarily surrendered\" by their mother. Tribal jurisdiction under\r\n      § 1911(a) was not meant to be defeated by the actions of individual\r\n      members of the tribe, for Congress was concerned not solely about the\r\n      interests of Indian children and families, but also about the impact on\r\n      the tribes themselves of the large numbers of Indian children adopted\r\n      by non-Indians. The numerous prerogatives accorded the tribes\r\n      through the ICWA's substantive provisions . . . must, accordingly, be\r\n      seen as a means of protecting not only the interests of individual\r\n      Indian children and families, but also of the tribes themselves.\r\n\r\nId. at 49 (internal citations and footnote omitted).16\r\n\r\nTherefore, exercising its power under the Indian Commerce Clause of the United\r\nStates Constitution, U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, Congress passed the ICWA making,\r\ninter alia, these specific findings:\r\n\r\n\r\n16While the present case does not involve section 1911(a), which grants tribes\r\nexclusive jurisdiction to determine placement of Indian children who are either\r\ndomiciled on a reservation or a ward of the tribe, the ICWA \"lays out a dual\r\njurisdictional scheme.\" Holyfield, 490 U.S. at 36. Therefore, in cases of children\r\nnot domiciled on the reservation, section 1911(b), as noted in the Holyfield\r\ndecision,\r\n\r\n      creates concurrent but presumptively tribal jurisdiction in the case of\r\n      children not domiciled on the reservation: on petition of either parent\r\n      or the tribe, state court proceedings for foster care placement or\r\n      termination of parental rights are to be transferred to the tribal court,\r\n      except in cases of \"good cause,\" objection by either parent, or\r\n      declination of jurisdiction by the tribal court.\r\n\r\nId. In cases of concurrent jurisdiction between states and tribes, the ICWA \"set[s]\r\nprocedural and substantive standards for those child custody proceedings that do\r\ntake place in state court.\" Id. Thus, the clear message of Holyfield, even though\r\nconstruing section 1911(a), still rings true in this child custody proceeding: the\r\nICWA safeguards the tribe's role in child custody proceedings affecting its children\r\nand protects a tribe's strong interest in retaining its children within the tribe. Id. at\r\n37.\r\n\n      (3) that there is no resource that is more vital to the continued\r\n      existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and that the\r\n      United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian\r\n      children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an\r\n      Indian tribe;\r\n\r\n      (4) that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken\r\n      up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by\r\n      nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high\r\n      percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and\r\n      adoptive homes and institutions; and\r\n\r\n      (5) that the States, exercising their recognized jurisdiction over Indian\r\n      child custody proceedings through administrative and judicial bodies,\r\n      have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian\r\n      people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian\r\n      communities and families.\r\n\r\n25 U.S.C. § 1901.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Congress declared:\r\n\r\n      [I]t is the policy of this Nation to protect the best interests of Indian\r\n      children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and\r\n      families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the\r\n      removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of\r\n      such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the\r\n      unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for assistance to\r\n      Indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.\r\n\r\nId. § 1902.17\r\n\r\n17 Given that its policy conflicts with the express purpose of the ICWA, we take\r\nthis opportunity to reject the \"Existing Indian Family\" doctrine (the \"EIF\"). See\r\nNote, The Indian Childs Welfare Act of 1978: Does it Apply to the Adoption of an\r\nIllegitimate Indian Child?, 38 Cath. U. L. Rev., 511, 534 (1989) (\"In light of the\r\nlegislative history of the ICWA, the existing Indian family theory is thus contrary\r\nto the intent of Congress.\" (footnotes omitted)). The EIF is a judicially created\r\nexception to the application of the ICWA. See In the Matter of the Adoption of\r\nBaby Boy L., 643 P.2d 168, 175 (Kan. 1982), overruled by In the Matter of A.J.S.,\r\n\nBecause the ICWA establishes \"minimum Federal standards for the removal of\r\nIndian children from their families\" and applies to any child custody proceeding\r\ninvolving an Indian child, see 25 U.S.C. §§ 1902, 1903, 1911, it is through this\r\nlens that we are constrained to decide the present controversy.\r\n\r\n                   II.    Transfer of Baby Girl to South Carolina\r\n\r\nIn its rendering of the facts of the case, the final order of the family court stated\r\nthat if it were not for the misinformation provided to the Cherokee Nation about\r\nthe birth father during the process of securing the ICPC, \"[Appellants] [would not\r\nhave] received permission to remove the child from Oklahoma and transport the\r\nchild to their home state of South Carolina just days after her birth.\" This\r\nstatement was neither a finding of fact nor a conclusion of law, but rather was part\r\nof the factual background provided in the order. Nevertheless, on appeal\r\nRespondents argue that South Carolina courts lack jurisdiction to determine the\r\ncustody issues. In response, Appellants argue that they properly transferred Baby\r\nGirl to South Carolina, and if not, the improper transfer was forgivable or\r\nunderstandable. More specifically, Appellants contend the ICPC form, which did\r\nnot accurately represent Baby Girl's Indian heritage, should not be construed\r\nagainst them because the ICPC does not protect the rights of birth parents but is\r\ndesigned to ensure the child's safe transfer across state lines. Thus, Appellants\r\nmaintain, they have satisfied the requirements of the ICPC by providing Baby Girl\r\nwith a safe and loving home. Furthermore, while Appellants do not dispute that\r\nthe Cherokee Nation was never informed of Baby Girl's status as an Indian child,\r\nAppellants argue that the misspelling of Father's name was an obvious mistake,\r\nwhich they subsequently corrected by amending their pleadings to allege Father is\r\na Cherokee Indian.\r\n\r\nAppellants correctly identify the purpose of the ICPC. See Doe v. Baby Girl, 376\r\nS.C. 267, 284, 657 S.E.2d 455, 464 (2008) (\"[W]e note the ICPC was designed to\r\nensure that placements for children across state lines are safe; it was not designed\r\n\r\n\r\n204 P.3d 543 (Kan. 2009) (holding the purpose of the ICWA \"was not to dictate\r\nthat an illegitimate infant who has never been a member of an Indian home or\r\nculture, and probably never would be, should be removed from its primary cultural\r\nheritage and placed in an Indian environment over the express objections of its\r\nnon-Indian mother\"). In so holding, we join the majority of our sister states who\r\nhave rejected the EIF or have since abandoned the exception. See In the Matter of\r\nA.J.S., 204 P.3d at 548–49 (listing the states that have rejected the EIF).\r\n\nto protect the rights of the birth parents. Certainly, there was no evidence that Baby\r\nGirl's placement with appellants had become unsafe in any way.\" (internal citation\r\nomitted)). However, we think Appellants' argument mischaracterizes the family\r\ncourt's statement. The family court did not find that Appellants violated the ICPC\r\nby unsafely transferring Baby Girl across state lines. Rather, Appellants' mistake\r\nwhen researching Father's tribal membership coupled with the subsequent omission\r\non the ICPC form, meant that the Cherokee Nation was not properly alerted to\r\nBaby Girl's status as an Indian child; and therefore, the tribe's right to participate in\r\nBaby Girl's placement was never triggered before Appellants removed Baby Girl\r\nfrom Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nWhile the evidence establishes Baby Girl would not be in South Carolina had the\r\nCherokee Nation been properly noticed of her status as an Indian child, we agree\r\nwith Appellants that the propriety of Baby Girl's transfer to South Carolina was\r\nlitigated in the Oklahoma action when the Oklahoma court issued an order\r\ndismissing the case on jurisdictional grounds. Appellants correctly point out that\r\nin Father's Response to Appellants' Motion to Dismiss, he argued that the ICPC\r\nrequest form \"would not have been processed by Michael Nomura of Heritage\r\nFamily Services without giving notice to the Cherokee Nation had Defendant not\r\nwithheld the fact that the baby was part American Indian on the form.\" After\r\nconsidering this and other arguments, the Oklahoma court issued an order\r\ndismissing the action on jurisdictional grounds, and neither Father nor the\r\nCherokee Nation appealed that order. Therefore, because no appeal was taken\r\nfrom the dismissal of the action, that decision remains the law of the case. See\r\nUlmer v. Ulmer, 369 S.C. 486, 490, 632 S.E.2d 858, 861 (2006) (\"A portion of a\r\njudgment that is not appealed presents no issue for determination by the reviewing\r\ncourt and constitutes, rightly or wrongly, the law of the case.\").\r\n\r\nBecause the Oklahoma court declined to exercise jurisdiction in this case, it is now\r\nincumbent on this Court to resolve the myriad issues concerning Baby Girl's final\r\nplacement.      III.   Father's Status as a \"Parent\" under the ICWA\r\n\r\nAppellants claim Father does not have standing to invoke the protection of the\r\nICWA because Father does not meet the ICWA's statutory definition of \"parent\"\r\nfound in section 1903(9).18 We disagree.\r\n\r\n18Appellants also urge this Court to conclude that the ICWA does not apply if we\r\nconclude Father is not a \"parent\" as defined by the ICWA. However, the ICWA's\r\n\nThe family court found the ICWA was applicable, in that the Cherokee Nation is\r\nan \"Indian Tribe,\" Baby Girl is an \"Indian Child,\" and Father is a \"parent\" as\r\nprescribed in the ICWA. See 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4), (8)–(9).\r\n\r\n      The ICWA defines \"parent\" as\r\n\r\n      any biological parent or parents of an Indian child or any Indian\r\n      person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child, including adoptions\r\n      under tribal law or custom. It does not include the unwed father where\r\n      paternity has not been acknowledged or established.\r\n\r\nId. § 1903(9) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAppellants argue that unwed fathers must show more than \"mere biology\" to\r\ninvoke the protections of the ICWA. The ICWA does not explicitly set forth a\r\nprocedure for an unwed father to acknowledge or establish paternity; thus,\r\nAppellants argue that the ICWA defers to state law on this point. Relying on\r\nsection 63-9-310(A)(5) of the South Carolina Code,19 Appellants contend that\r\n\r\n\r\napplicability stems from Baby Girl's status as an Indian child under section\r\n1903(4). See Note, The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978: Does it Apply to the\r\nAdoption of an Illegitimate Indian Child?, supra note 17, at 540 (\"Congress clearly\r\nintends that the only prerequisite to the operation of the ICWA be the involvement\r\nof an Indian Child in a child custody proceeding.\"). Thus, the ICWA applies\r\nbecause Baby Girl is an Indian child, and whether or not this Court finds Father a\r\n\"parent\" has no bearing on the ICWA's applicability.\r\n19That section provides that an unwed father must consent to an adoption taking\r\nplace within six months of a child's birth only if:\r\n\r\n      (a) the father openly lived with the child or the child's mother for a\r\n          continuous period of six months immediately preceding the\r\n          placement of the child for adoption, and the father openly held\r\n          himself out to be the father of the child during the six months\r\n          period; or\r\n\r\n      (b) the father paid a fair and reasonable sum, based on the father's\r\n          financial ability, for the support of the child or for expenses\r\n          incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy or with the\r\n\nbecause Father neither lived with Mother for a continuous period of six months\r\nbefore the child's birth, nor contributed to her pregnancy-related expenses, Father\r\ndoes not qualify as a \"parent\" under the ICWA.\r\n\r\nIn making the determination that Father was a \"parent\" under the ICWA, the\r\nfamily court focused on the distinction between the requirements for an unwed\r\nfather to consent to an adoption under state law versus the requirements for an\r\nunwed father to establish paternity under the ICWA, and found the \"ICWA extends\r\ngreater rights to the unwed Indian father\" than state law. (emphasis added). The\r\nfamily court's finding and Appellants' argument collapse the notions of paternity\r\nand consent. However, the family court ultimately concluded that Father met the\r\nICWA's definition of \"parent\" by both acknowledging his paternity through the\r\npursuit of court proceedings as soon as he realized Baby Girl had been placed up\r\nfor adoption and establishing his paternity through DNA testing. We agree with\r\nthe family court that, by its plain terms, this is all that is required under the ICWA.\r\nTherefore, Father is a \"parent\" as defined by the ICWA.\r\n\r\n                        IV.    Termination of Parental Rights\r\n\r\nBecause we find Father is a \"parent\"20 for purposes of the application of the ICWA,\r\nwe now turn to whether Father's parental rights should be terminated. While the\r\nICWA incorporates state law termination grounds, it also clearly mandates state\r\ncourts consider heightened federal requirements to terminate parental rights as to\r\nICWA parents.21\r\n\r\n\r\n          birth of the child, including, but not limited to, medical, hospital,\r\n          and nursing expenses.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-310(A)(5) (2010). Under state law, Father's consent to the\r\nadoption would not have been required.\r\n20We note that Father is not afforded protection under the ICWA merely because\r\nhe is an Indian parent. The ICWA also provides protection to non-Indian parents,\r\nso long as they are a parent of an \"Indian Child\" as defined by section 1903(4).\r\n21We agree with the dissent that the ICWA does not operate to \"oust\" the states'\r\njurisdiction to make custody determinations affecting Indian children. See\r\nHolyfield, 490 U.S. at 58 (citation omitted). However, in cases where state courts\r\nare considering the placement of an Indian child, the ICWA sets forth important\r\nprocedural and substantive provisions that state courts must follow. Id. at 36.\r\n\n                                 A. Voluntary Termination\r\n\r\nWhile Father's consent would not have been required under South Carolina law,\r\nsee S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-310(A)(5), for a parent to voluntarily relinquish his or\r\nher parental rights under the ICWA, his or her\r\n\r\n      consent shall not be valid unless executed in writing and recorded\r\n      before a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction and accompanied\r\n      by the presiding judge's certificate that the terms and consequences of\r\n      the consent were fully explained in detail and were fully understood\r\n      by the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall also certify that\r\n      either the parent or Indian custodian fully understood the explanation\r\n      in English or that it was interpreted into a language that the parent or\r\n      Indian custodian understood. Any consent given prior to, or within ten\r\n      days after, birth of the Indian child shall not be valid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile state termination grounds play a part in custody proceedings under the\r\nICWA, we believe, unlike the dissent, that state law cannot operate to frustrate the\r\nclear purposes of the ICWA, as \"Congress perceived the States and their courts as\r\npartly responsible for the problem [the ICWA] intended to correct.\" Id. at 44–45.\r\nIn fact, to achieve its desired goal of placing Baby Girl with Appellants, the dissent\r\nutilizes reasoning expressly rejected by the Holyfield court in finding that a state\r\ncourt could not employ state abandonment principles to sidestep the ICWA's clear\r\nmandates in order to sanction an Indian mother's attempt to avoid the ICWA's\r\ndomiciliary provisions to facilitate an adoption by white parents. See id. at 52–53\r\n(stating this insertion of state abandonment principles \"conflicts with and\r\nundermines the operative scheme established by subsections [1911(a)] and\r\n[1913(a)] to deal with children of domiciliaries of the reservation and weakens\r\nconsiderably the tribe's ability to assert its interest in its children. This relationship\r\nbetween Indian tribes and Indian children domiciled on the reservation finds no\r\nparallel in other ethnic cultures found in the United States. It is a relationship that\r\nmany non-Indians find difficult to understand and that non-Indian courts are slow\r\nto recognize. It is precisely in recognition of this relationship, however, that the\r\nICWA designates the tribal court as the exclusive forum for the determination of\r\ncustody and adoption matters for reservation-domiciled Indian children, and the\r\npreferred forum for nondomiciliary Indian children. [State] abandonment law\r\ncannot be used to frustrate the federal legislative judgment expressed in the ICWA\r\nthat the interests of the tribe in custodial decisions made with respect to Indian\r\nchildren are as entitled to respect as the interests of the parents.\" (quoting In re\r\nAdoption of Halloway, 732 P.2d 962, 969–970 (1986))).\r\n\n25 U.S.C. § 1913(a). Moreover, a parent may withdraw his or her consent \"for any\r\nreason at any time prior to the entry of a final decree of termination or adoption, as\r\nthe case may be, and the child shall be returned to the parent.\" Id. § 1913(c).\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed that the only consent document Father ever signed was a one-page\r\n\"Acceptance of Service\" stating he was not contesting the adoption, which was\r\npurportedly presented for Father's signature as a prerequisite to the service of a\r\nsummons and complaint. Thus, Appellants did not follow the clear procedural\r\ndirectives of section 1913(a) in obtaining Father's consent. Moreover, even if this\r\n\"consent\" was valid under the statute, then Father's subsequent legal campaign to\r\nobtain custody of Baby Girl has rendered any such consent withdrawn. Therefore,\r\nneither Father's signature on the \"Acceptance of Service\" document, nor his stated\r\nintentions to relinquish his rights, were effectual forms of voluntary consent under\r\nthe ICWA.                      B. Involuntary Termination\r\n\r\nThus, we may only grant Appellants' adoption decree with respect to Father in the\r\nabsence of his voluntary consent if Appellants can establish grounds for\r\ninvoluntarily terminating Father's parental rights under state law and the ICWA.\r\n\r\nUnder the ICWA, in addition to any state law grounds for termination, Appellants\r\nmust \"satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial\r\nservices and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian\r\nfamily and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d).\r\nMoreover,\r\n\r\n      No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding\r\n      in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a\r\n      reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses,\r\n      that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian\r\n      custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to\r\n      the child.\r\n\r\nId. § 1912(f) (emphasis added).\r\n\n                               1. Active Remedial Measures\r\n\r\nTo effect termination under the ICWA, the parties seeking termination \"shall\r\nsatisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services\r\nand rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family\r\nand that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d).\r\n\r\nAppellants admit that the provision has not been satisfied; however, they seek to\r\navoid the remedial measures requirement by claiming that any efforts to\r\nrehabilitate Father would be futile. We find Appellants' futility argument\r\ninsufficient to override the clear mandate of section 1912(d) under these facts.\r\n\r\nEven assuming the dissent is correct in finding that Father did not want custody of\r\nBaby Girl and did not desire to act as a parent to her, straightforward application of\r\nthe language of section 1912(d) requires that remedial services be offered to\r\naddress any parenting issues to prevent the breakup of the Indian family—for\r\nexample, by attempting to stimulate Father's desire to be a parent or to provide\r\nnecessary education regarding the role of a parent.22 In this case, far from offering\r\nsuch services, Appellants—perhaps understandably, given the emotionally\r\nwrenching circumstances—have actively sought to prevent Father from obtaining\r\ncustody of Baby Girl since she was four months old. Father, despite some early\r\nindications of possible lack of interest in Baby Girl, not only reversed course at an\r\nearly point but has maintained that course despite this active opposition.\r\nTherefore, a finding on these facts that the remedial measures mandated by the\r\nICWA may be waived would be an unwarranted substitution of this Court's\r\npreferences for the clear dictates of statutory law.23\r\n\r\n22 The dissent rightly points out that, in most termination cases, the state initiates\r\nremedial or rehabilitative efforts after removing a child from parental custody.\r\nHowever, the dissent acknowledges that \"such services may also be offered to\r\nparents proactively to prevent a child's removal in the first instance.\" The ICWA\r\ndoes not distinguish removal situations from adoptive placements. Thus, had the\r\ntribe been properly noticed of the adoption from the outset, it would have been the\r\ntribe's prerogative to take remedial measures to reunify the Indian family.\r\n23We note that even under South Carolina law, we do not terminate parental rights\r\nmerely because a parent is not a perfect parent. See Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C.\r\n281, 296, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999). Thus, only where \"reunification is not\r\npossible or appropriate\" may a party move to terminate the parent's rights by\r\n\n                  2. Likelihood of Serious Emotional or Physical Damage\r\n\r\nSection 1912(f) requires a qualified expert to provide evidence satisfying this\r\nCourt beyond a reasonable doubt \"that the continued custody of the child by the\r\nparent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical\r\ndamage to the child.\" The family court applied a clear and convincing standard of\r\nreview, pursuant to Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982), even though the\r\ninstant case deals with termination of parental rights under the ICWA. While the\r\nfamily court misinterpreted Santosky,24 considering it found Appellants failed to\r\n\r\n\r\nproving a basis for termination by clear and convincing evidence. Id.; see also\r\nRichland Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868\r\n(1998) (citing Greenville Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 437\r\nS.E.2d 107 (1993)). Our cases demonstrate that when a parent consciously refuses\r\nto support, visit, or otherwise make a suitable environment for their child,\r\ntermination is appropriate, but even in extreme cases, we seek to rehabilitate the\r\nparent either by ordering them to pay support, addressing any substance abuse\r\nissues, or instituting a treatment or placement plan. See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\nM.R.C.L., 393 S.C. 387, 390–95, 712 S.E.2d 452, 454–57 (2011) (terminating\r\nparental rights as to parents who tested positive for crack cocaine, failed to\r\ncomplete drug and alcohol testing, and refused to comply with court ordered child\r\nsupport); Hooper, 334 S.C. at 296–301, 513 S.E.2d at 366–69 (terminating parental\r\nrights based on mother's severe abuse and neglect of her child, refusal to satisfy\r\ncourt ordered support obligations, and failure to comply with at least twelve\r\ntreatment plans designed to remedy the conditions which led to her child's\r\nremoval); Earles, 330 S.C. at 32–34, 496 S.E.2d at 868–70 (terminating parental\r\nrights after mother's home could not be made safe within twelve months due to\r\nmother's physical and sexual abuse of her two children over the course of four\r\nyears); S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 48, 413 S.E.2d 835, 835\r\n(1992) (terminating parental rights after mother failed to support child by making\r\nonly three court ordered child support payments over a one-year period, attending\r\nonly thirty-five of ninety-four visits scheduled with the child over a four-year\r\nperiod, and failing to visit the child at all for a period of five months); Dep't of Soc.\r\nServs. v. Phillips, 365 S.C. 572, 580, 618 S.E.2d 922, 926 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n(terminating parental rights after children were exposed to sexual behaviors\r\nbetween mother and father and mother failed to remedy her drug addiction\r\nproblem during the year the children were removed from the home).\r\n24   In Santosky, the Supreme Court held that the minimum burden of proof allowable\r\n\nmeet even the lower burden, we agree that Appellants have not satisfied their\r\nburden of proving that Father's custody of Baby Girl would result in serious\r\nemotional or physical harm to her beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nThe family court admitted the testimony of Dr. Bart Saylor as Appellants' expert\r\nwitness to demonstrate the likelihood of damage to Baby Girl if removed from\r\nAppellants' custody. Dr. Saylor, a licensed clinical psychologist and designated\r\nforensic psychologist, conducted a bonding evaluation with Appellants and Baby\r\nGirl, but had no contact with Father. Dr. Saylor only considered the effect of\r\nsevering Baby Girl's bond with Appellants and did not review any information\r\nabout Father's capacity to form a loving relationship with Baby Girl. Although\r\nDr. Saylor admitted he did not have specific training in Cherokee child rearing\r\npractices, he did not believe knowledge of Indian culture was necessary to evaluate\r\nthe bonding between Baby Girl and Appellants. Dr. Saylor testified that\r\nAppellants and Baby Girl had a very strong bond, and therefore,\r\n\r\n      I believe that at this point removal from the one and only parents, the\r\n      secure, the bonded relationship, the one and only that she has with\r\n      these parents at this age would be very traumatic, would be very\r\n      disruptive. It could produce depression, anxiety, it could cause\r\n      disruption in her capacity to form relationships at a later age. It would\r\n      be extremely stressful to her. It would be taking away everything that\r\n      she had come to know and count on for her comfort and security and\r\n      replace it with something that would be completely unfamiliar and\r\n      strange to her.\r\n\r\nDr. Saylor confirmed that he believed beyond a reasonable doubt that Baby Girl's\r\nremoval from Appellants would cause serious emotional harm. However, Dr.\r\nSaylor agreed that even though a child may have bonded successfully one time, a\r\nchild can bond again. Finally, he could not say what long-term harm would result\r\nfrom Baby Girl's removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin a state-initiated termination of parental rights proceedings was \"clear and\r\nconvincing evidence.\" 455 U.S. at 769. Any lesser standard would deprive a\r\nparent of due process under the law. Id. While the Santosky court mentioned that\r\nstates might find the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard utilized in the ICWA an\r\n\"unreasonable barrier to state efforts to free permanently neglected children for\r\nadoption,\" the thrust of the Santosky decision was to create a minimum, not a\r\nmaximum, burden of proof in termination of parental rights proceedings.\r\n\nFather's expert, Tiffany Dunaway, a Child Welfare Specialist with the Cherokee\r\nNation who has worked with between ten and fifteen transitioned children the\r\nsame age as Baby Girl, conducted a home study on Father's family while Father\r\nwas stationed on active duty in Iraq. Dunaway reported that the family home was\r\nclean, safe, and appropriate and that there were many acres of land surrounding the\r\nhome for outdoor play. Based on her interaction with Father's parents, Dunaway\r\nopined, \"this child will thrive, I don't have any doubt. I know we can't predict the\r\nfuture, but I think that she will be safe . . . . She'll know who she is and where she\r\ncame from. She'll be very loved.\" Under cross-examination, Dunaway admitted\r\nthat some transitioned children have difficulties, especially older children, but\r\ntestified that these children have thrived overall. Dunaway admitted that she had\r\nnever met Baby Girl, nor had she witnessed Father interact with a child the same\r\nage as Baby Girl. Dunaway's opinion about the ability of the child to thrive was\r\nbased on anecdotal experience, and she could not produce any studies to show that\r\ntransitioned children thrive in the long-term.25\r\n\r\nIn its final order, the family court noted that Dr. Saylor could not render an opinion\r\nabout the long-term effects of severing the bond between Appellants and Baby\r\nGirl, although he testified that in the short-term it would be very traumatic. The\r\nfamily court found persuasive the testimony that Father was a good father who\r\nenjoyed a close relationship with his other daughter and Dunaway's testimony that\r\nchildren around Baby Girl's age tended to thrive when reunited with their Indian\r\nparents. Therefore, the family court concluded that Appellants did not prove that\r\n\"the child will suffer physical or emotional damage if returned to the custody of\r\nher biological father,\" and as a result, \"the ICWA prohibits termination of his\r\nparental rights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25 The dissent finds Dunaway's opinion \"lacks credibility\" as to whether Baby Girl\r\nwould suffer harm if removed from Appellants' custody, citing testimony in which\r\nAppellants' counsel challenged Dunaway to provide statistics that children placed\r\nin tribal homes have not suffered serious harm, rather than basing her assertions on\r\nher personal experience as a case worker. We disagree that this exchange reflects\r\nnegatively on Dunaway's credibility, as she testified to her personal experience in\r\ntransitioning children. In any event, it was Appellants' burden to establish a\r\nlikelihood of serious emotional or physical harm beyond a reasonable doubt if\r\nBaby Girl were placed with Father.\r\n\nAppellants argue that section 1912(f) does not require a child to suffer long-term\r\nharm. Appellants urge this Court to find severe emotional harm likely based solely\r\non the expected harm of severing Baby Girl's bond from the only parents she\r\nknows.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note that the plain language of section 1912(d) requires a showing that\r\nthe transferee parent's prospective legal and physical custody is likely to result in\r\nserious damage to the Indian child, not that the Indian child's removal from the\r\ncustody of the adoptive parents will likely result in emotional damage, which in\r\nthis case Appellants' expert admits is likely to be temporary.26\r\n\r\nAbsent any evidence to the contrary, we hold that Appellants' reliance on bonding,\r\nwithout more, cannot satisfy their high burden of proving that Father's custody of\r\nBaby Girl would result in serious emotional or physical damage to her. While we\r\nare conscious that any separation will cause some degree of pain, we can only\r\nconclude from the evidence presented at trial that Father desires to be a parent to\r\nBaby Girl, and that he and his family have created a safe, loving, and appropriate\r\nhome for her. Furthermore, Father instituted child custody proceedings when Baby\r\nGirl was four months old. See Rick P. v. State, OCS, 109 P.3d 950, 958 (Alaska\r\n2005) (footnote omitted) (\"Our cases indicate that a parent's willingness to resume\r\nparental duties does not 'remedy' abandonment if this change of heart comes too\r\nlate for the parent to bond with the child during the critical early phase of the\r\nchild's life.\"). Because Father intervened at this early point and most of the\r\nbonding occurred during the course of this litigation, it should not be a factor that\r\nweighs against Father. See Holyfield, 490 U.S. at 53–54 (1989) (\"We are not\r\nunaware that over three years have passed since the twin babies were born and\r\n\r\n26Even in cases of the voluntary relinquishment of parental rights, the parent has\r\nthe ability under the ICWA to renege on his or her consent \"for any reason at any\r\ntime\" before the entry of the final decree of termination or adoption. See 25 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1913(c) (emphasis added). Thus, the ICWA gives conclusive preference to\r\nparental custody over custodial stability. Indeed, the dissent's dependence on\r\nFather's perceived lack of interest in or support for Baby Girl during the pregnancy\r\nand first four months of her life as a basis for termination his rights as a parent is\r\nnot a valid consideration under the ICWA for this same reason. Because the\r\nICWA permits a parent to revoke voluntary consent up until the final adoption\r\ndecree for any reason at all, whatever Father's deficit in expressing interest in Baby\r\nGirl, it clearly falls short of consent to termination, and even then, his rights would\r\nnot be prejudiced until a final decree.\r\n\nplaced in the [adoptive] home, and that a court deciding their fate today is not\r\nwriting on a blank slate in the same way it would have [three years ago]. Three\r\nyears' development of family ties cannot be undone, and a separation at this point\r\nwould doubtless cause considerable pain . . . . Had the mandate of the ICWA been\r\nfollowed [three years ago], of course, much potential anguish might have been\r\navoided, and in any case the law cannot be applied so as automatically to 'reward\r\nthose who obtain custody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it during\r\nany ensuing (and protracted) litigation.'\" (citation omitted)). Thus, the bonding that\r\noccurred during litigation, without more, cannot form the basis for terminating\r\nFather's parental rights.\r\n\r\n                       3. State Statutory Grounds for Termination\r\n\r\nBecause we have found that Appellants have not met their burden of proof to\r\nestablish termination under the ICWA, we need not address the grounds for\r\ntermination elucidated in section 63-7-2570 of the South Carolina Code. See\r\nWilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transp. Co., 382 S.C. 295, 307, 676\r\nS.E.2d 700, 706 (2009) (appellate court need not discuss remaining issues when\r\ndetermination of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n                               4. Best Interests of the Child\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina courts have a long history of determining custody disputes based\r\non the \"best interests of the child.\" See Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 295,\r\n513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999) (\"This Court long has tried to decide all matters\r\ninvolving the custody or care of children in 'light of the fundamental principle that\r\nthe controlling consideration is the best interests of the child.'\" (quoting In Re\r\nDoran, 129 S.C. 26, 31, 123 S.E. 501, 503 (1924))). This important history is not\r\nreplaced by the ICWA's mandate. See In re Welfare of L.N.B.-L, 237 P.3d 944,\r\n965 (Wash. Ct. App. 2010) (\"ICWA's applicability does not mean that ICWA\r\nreplaces state law with regard to a child's best interests.\") Instead, \"[w]ell­\r\nestablished principles for deciding custody matters should further [the ICWA's]\r\ngoals.\" Id. (quoting In re Mahaney, 51 P.3d 776, 785 (Wash. 2002)).\r\n\r\nWhere an Indian child's best interests are at stake, our inquiry into that child's best\r\ninterests must also account for his or her status as an Indian, and therefore, we\r\nmust also inquire into whether the placement is in the best interests of the Indian\r\nchild. See 25 U.S.C. § 1902 (\"The Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of\r\nthis Nation to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the\r\nstability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of\r\n\nminimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families\r\nand the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect\r\nthe unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for assistance to Indian tribes\r\nin the operation of child and family service programs.\"). In making this\r\ndetermination, the child's relationship with his or her tribe is an important\r\nconsideration, as the ICWA is \"based on the fundamental assumption that it is in\r\nthe Indian child's best interest that its relationship to the tribe be protected.\"\r\nHolyfield, 490 U.S. at 50 n.24 (quoting In re Appeal in Pima Cnty. Juvenile Action\r\nNo. S-903, 635 P.2d 187, 189 (Ariz. 1981)).27 Thus, Baby Girl, as an Indian child,\r\nhas a strong interest in retaining ties to her cultural heritage. See id. at 49–50 (\"In\r\naddition, it is clear that Congress's concern over the placement of Indian children\r\nin non-Indian homes was based in part on evidence of the detrimental impact on\r\nthe children themselves of such placements outside their culture.\").28\r\n\r\n27 While the tribe ultimately decided to return the Holyfield children to the\r\nadoptive parents, the dissent fails to account for the marked difference between the\r\nfacts of the Holyfield custody dispute and those of the present controversy, and the\r\nactual basis for the tribe's decision: the children had been in the care of the\r\nadoptive parents for four years; they did not understand the Choctaw language,\r\nwhich was the predominant language spoken in most Choctaw homes; and no\r\nadoptive tribal home was waiting for the children, so that interim placement in\r\nfoster care would have been necessary. See Solangel Maldonado, Race, Culture,\r\nand Adoption: Lessons from Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 17\r\nColum. J. Gender & L. 1, 17–18 (2008). Moreover, the tribal court ordered that\r\nthe children maintain contact with their Choctaw extended family and tribe, and\r\nthe placement was within the same state. Id. at 18; Holyfield, 490 U.S. at 40.\r\nThus, the children's and tribe's respective interests in maintaining cultural ties were\r\nstill protected.\r\n28The Record establishes that Father's family has a deeply embedded relationship\r\nwith the Cherokee Nation. For example, not only does the Record indicate that\r\nFather and his family are proud of their heritage and membership in the Wolf Clan,\r\nthe home study performed on Father's parents states the following:\r\n\r\n      [Father's father] is Cherokee Indian. He grew up knowing he was\r\n      Cherokee and being proud of who he was. [Father's parents] . . .\r\n      prepare the following traditional foods in their home: grape\r\n      dumplings, buckskin bread, Indian cornbread, Indian tacos, wild\r\n      onions, fry bread, polk salad and deer meat. [Father's mother] state[d]\r\n      she cooks these foods in her home on a regular basis and all of her\r\n\nThe family court order stated, \"[w]hen parental rights and the best interests of the\r\nchild are in conflict, the best interests of the child must prevail. However, in this\r\ncase, I find no conflict between the two.\"29 Likewise, we cannot say that Baby\r\nGirl's best interests are not served by the grant of custody to Father, as Appellants\r\nhave not presented evidence that Baby Girl would not be safe, loved, and cared for\r\nif raised by Father and his family. Moreover, in transferring custody to Father and\r\nhis family, Baby Girl's familial and tribal ties may be established and maintained in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      children have eaten these items.\r\n\r\n      [Father's parents] attend the Cherokee Holiday in Tahlequah,\r\n      Oklahoma[,] when they can and participate in eating traditional foods,\r\n      viewing the arts and crafts and watching the traditional games.\r\n      [Father's father] participates in voting in the Cherokee elections[,] . . .\r\n      . took part in learning about the Cherokee culture when his children\r\n      were in high school by learning to make Indian crafts and learning to\r\n      play the drum[, and] . . . . is sometimes seen at the Nowata Indian\r\n      Health Clinic but receives the majority of his health care from the\r\n      Veterans hospital. He claims his family is from the Wolf Clan, and he\r\n      has been to as well as participated in stomp dances.\r\n\r\n      [H]is family had Indian land which was located in Pryor, Oklahoma\r\n      and Cayuga, Oklahoma. He claims to have very traditional ties with\r\n      his extended family and considers geneology [sic] a hobby by\r\n      researching his Cherokee culture. [Father's parents] have many\r\n      Native American items in their home. Decorative Native American\r\n      pieces are scattered throughout their home in nearly every room.\r\n\r\nThus, the Record demonstrates that Father and his family are well-positioned to\r\nintroduce Baby Girl to her Indian heritage.\r\n29The dissent states: \"It is apparent that the decision of the family court judge was\r\ninfluenced to some extent by the erroneous legal conclusion that ICWA eclipses\r\nthe family court's obligation to determine what would be in the child's best\r\ninterests.\" We do not read the family court's order to be based on that erroneous\r\nassumption. Plainly, the family court determined that there was no conflict\r\nbetween Father's best interests and Baby Girl's best interests. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 63-9-20 (stating that in adoption proceedings \"when the interests of a child and\r\nan adult are in conflict, the conflict must be resolved in favor of the child.\").\r\n\nfurtherance of the clear purpose of the ICWA, which is to preserve American\r\nIndian culture by retaining its children within the tribe. See Holyfield, 490 U.S. at\r\n37.                              C. Preferential Placement\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even if we were to terminate Father's rights, section 1915(a) of the\r\nICWA establishes a hierarchy of preferences for the adoptive placement of an\r\nIndian child.30 See 25 U.S.C. 1915(a). That section provides: \"[i]n any adoptive\r\nplacement of an Indian child under State law, a preference shall be given, in the\r\nabsence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the\r\nchild's extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child's tribe; or (3) other\r\nIndian families.\" (emphasis added). While not binding, the Bureau of Indian\r\nAffairs Guidelines concerning good cause state that courts may look to the \"request\r\nof the biological parents or the child when the child is of sufficient age,\" the\r\n\"extraordinary physical or emotional needs of the child as established by testimony\r\nof a qualified expert witness,\" and the \"unavailability of suitable families for\r\nplacement after a diligent search has been completed for families meeting the\r\npreference criteria\" when deciding to deviate from the stated preferences. 44 Fed.\r\nReg. 67584, 67954–95 (1979). The party seeking to deviate from the preferences\r\nbears the burden of demonstrating that good cause exists. Id.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, rather than seek to place Baby Girl within a statutorily preferred\r\nhome, Mother sought placement in a non-Indian home.31 In our view, the ensuing\r\n\r\n\r\n30Holyfield describes this provision as \"[t]he most important substantive\r\nrequirement imposed on state courts\" under the ICWA towards creating a federal\r\npolicy that an Indian child should remain with his or her tribe whenever possible.\r\nHolyfield, 490 U.S. at 36, 37 (citation omitted).\r\n31 The biological parents' placement preference is not the guiding consideration\r\nunder the ICWA. Rather, the ICWA assigns great weight to tribal preference when\r\nplacing Indian children. See Holyfield, 490 U.S. at 52–53 (\"The protection of this\r\ntribal interest is at the core of the ICWA, which recognizes that the tribe has an\r\ninterest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the\r\nparents. This relationship between Indian tribes and Indian children domiciled on\r\nthe reservation finds no parallel in other ethnic cultures found in the United States.\r\nIt is a relationship that many non-Indians find difficult to understand and that non-\r\nIndian courts are slow to recognize. It is precisely in recognition of this\r\nrelationship, however, that the ICWA designates the tribal court as the exclusive\r\n\nbond that has formed in the wake of this wrongful placement cannot be relied on\r\nby Appellants and the dissent to deviate from the ICWA's placement preferences.\r\n\r\nWhile the best interests of the child standard is always a guiding consideration\r\nwhen placing a child, any attempt to utilize our state's best interests of the child\r\nstandard to eclipse the ICWA's statutory preferences ignores the fact that the\r\nstatutory placement preferences and the Indian child's best interests are not\r\nmutually exclusive considerations. Instead, the ICWA presumes that placement\r\nwithin its ambit is in the Indian child's best interests. See In re C.H., 997 P.2d 776,\r\n784 (Mont. 2000) (\"[T]he best interests of the child . . . is an improper test to use in\r\nICWA cases because the ICWA expresses the presumption that it is in an Indian\r\nchild’s best interests to be placed in accordance with statutory preferences. To\r\nallow emotional bonding—a normal and desirable outcome when, as here, a child\r\nlives with a foster family for several years—to constitute an 'extraordinary'\r\nemotional need [comprising good cause to deviate from the preferences] would\r\nessentially negate the ICWA presumption.\" (emphasis added)). Therefore, \"the\r\nunfettered exercise of [state] discretion poses a real danger that the ICWA\r\npreferences will be overridden upon the slightest evidence favoring alternative\r\nplacement.\" Barbara Ann Atwood, Flashpoints under the Indian Child Welfare\r\nAct: Toward a New Understanding of State Court Resistance, 51 Emory L.J. 587,\r\n645 (2002). Thus, the bonding that has occurred between Appellants and Baby\r\nGirl has not satisfied this Court that custody with Father is against Baby Girl's best\r\ninterests. For this reason, under these facts, we cannot say that bonding, standing\r\nalone, should form the basis for deviation from the statutory placement\r\npreferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforum for the determination of custody and adoption matters for reservation-\r\ndomiciled Indian children, and the preferred forum for nondomiciliary Indian\r\nchildren.

Tellinghuisan, The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978:\r\nA Practical Guide With [Limited] Commentary, 34 S.D. L. Rev. 660, 666 (1989)\r\n(\"Holyfield also carries the clear message that [the ICWA] would be read liberally,\r\nperhaps creatively, to protect the rights of the tribe even against the clearly\r\nexpressed wishes of the parents . . . .\").\r\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\r\n\r\nWe do not take lightly the grave interests at stake in this case. However, we are\r\nconstrained by the law and convinced by the facts that the transfer of custody to\r\nFather was required under the law. Adoptive Couple are ideal parents who have\r\nexhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment for Baby Girl. Thus,\r\nit is with a heavy heart that we affirm the family court order.\r\n\r\nBecause this case involves an Indian child, the ICWA applies and confers\r\nconclusive custodial preference to the Indian parent. All of the rest of our\r\ndeterminations flow from this reality. While we have the highest respect for the\r\ndeeply felt opinions expressed by the dissent, we simply see this case as one in\r\nwhich the dictates of federal Indian law supersede state law where the adoption and\r\ncustody of an Indian child is at issue. Father did not consent to Baby Girl's\r\nadoption, and we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that custody by him would\r\nresult in serious emotional or physical harm to Baby Girl. Thus, under the federal\r\nstandard we cannot terminate Father's parental rights. For these reasons, we affirm\r\nthe family court's denial of the adoption decree and transfer of custody to Father.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.

I would reverse and remand for the entry of\r\nan order terminating the father's parental rights and approving the adoption. I\r\nwould further order the immediate return of the minor child to the adoptive\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nToday the Court decides the fate of a child without regard to her best interests and\r\nwelfare. I disagree that Congress intended the Indian Child Welfare Act32 (ICWA\r\nor Act) to be applied in derogation of the child's best interests and welfare. See In\r\nre Welfare of L.N.B.-L, 237 P.3d 944, 965 (Wash. Ct. App. 2010) (\"ICWA's\r\napplicability does not mean that ICWA replaces state law with regard to a child's\r\nbest interests\"); In re Mahaney, 51 P.3d 776, 785 (Wash. 2002) (observing that\r\nICWA's applicability \"should not signal to state courts that state law is replaced by\r\nthe act's mandate\"). ICWA envisioned a symbiotic relationship between the\r\nadditional protections of the Act and well-established state law principles for\r\ndeciding custody matters in accordance with the best interests of the child. The\r\nsimple fact that a child is an \"Indian child\" is not dispositive of the placement\r\nquestion. In my judgment, Congress intended ICWA-controlled cases to be\r\ndecided based on a preference for placement with an Indian family, not an\r\nirrebuttable presumption mandating an Indian family placement. Even in\r\nMississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 32 (1988), the only\r\ncase in which the United States Supreme Court has addressed ICWA, the tribal\r\ncourt, on remand, ordered child placement with the non-Indian adoptive parent.\r\nSee Solangel Maldonado, Race, Culture, and Adoption: Lessons from Mississippi\r\nBand of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 17 Colum. J. Gender & L. 1, 17-18 (2008).\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, under our de novo review, the unique facts of this case manifestly\r\novercome the statutory placement preference and compel placement of this child\r\nwith the adoptive couple. The facts of a case cannot be ignored. With great\r\nrespect for the majority, I believe it has recast the facts to portray Father in an\r\nundeserved favorable light, thus creating the illusion that Father's interests are in\r\nharmony with the best interests of the child. The reality is Father purposely\r\nabandoned this child and no amount of revisionist history can change that truth.\r\nAs for the protracted procedural history, the Court blames the birth mother and the\r\n\r\n32\"ICWA establishes Federal minimum standards for the removal of Indian\r\nchildren from their homes and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive\r\nhomes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture . . . .\" 25 U.S.C. §\r\n1902.\r\n\nadoptive couple—everyone except the Father, whose vanishing act triggered the\r\nadoption in the first instance. As I view the evidence, the interests of Father and\r\nRespondents are directly contrary to the best interests of this child. I believe the\r\nlaw, including ICWA, supports my view that the best interests of the child must\r\nprevail.                                  I.\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis Court's standard of review in an appeal from the family court is de novo. S.C.\r\nConst. art. V, § 5 (\"The Court shall have appellate jurisdiction . . . in cases of\r\nequity, and in such appeals they shall review the findings of fact as well as the law\r\n. . . .\"); Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). As such,\r\n\"the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence.\" Lewis, 392 S.C. at 384, 709 S.E.2d at 651.\r\nAlthough we generally defer to findings of fact by the family court due to its\r\nability to assess the demeanor and credibility of witnesses, our standard of review\r\ndoes not require any deference. Having carefully reviewed the voluminous record,\r\nwith great respect for the able family court judge, I am firmly persuaded that the\r\nfamily court judge erred in her factual findings, especially in the application of the\r\nfacts to the law. Determining the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of\r\nlaw for our plenary review. Town of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378\r\nS.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008); see also E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471,\r\n473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992) (noting the appellate court has authority to correct\r\nerrors of law in appeals from family court orders).\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\n\r\n                                       FACTS\r\n\r\nAt the center of this controversy is a child (\"Baby Girl\") born to unwed parents on\r\nSeptember 15, 2009. Before her birth, the biological parents (\"Mother\" and\r\n\"Father\") were engaged to be married but were not living together. In addition to\r\nBaby Girl, Father has a child from a previous relationship who was six years old at\r\nthe time of the engagement. Father pays support for his other child through a\r\ndeduction from his military pay; however, those payments began only after that\r\n\nchild's mother brought an action against him in family court because he accrued an\r\nestimated $11,000 child support arrearage.33\r\n\r\nWhen Mother and Father were dating, Father was serving in the military and\r\nstationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, approximately four hours away from his\r\nhometown of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where his parents and Mother lived with her\r\ntwo other children from a previous relationship. Father visited Mother in\r\nBartlesville during his fourteen-day break in December 2008, and although he was\r\npermitted to leave the military base on weekends, he seldom made the four-hour\r\ndrive from Fort Sill to Bartlesville.34\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, Mother told Father they were expecting a child.35 Before her first\r\nprenatal doctor's appointment, Mother asked Father for financial assistance.\r\nAlthough he acknowledged paternity from the outset, Father refused to help\r\nfinancially unless he and Mother were married. At trial, Father was asked, \"But\r\nshe had to marry you before you felt you'd be responsible as a father?\" He\r\nanswered, \"Correct.\" After her prenatal appointment, Mother told Father the\r\nbaby's due date was in September 2009.\r\n\r\n33There are allegations that Father has another child; however he denies paternity\r\nand does not support that child.\r\n34Father explained, \"Being four hours away I was able to come home on the\r\nweekends, but I didn't make the right amount of money, you know, to be sufficient\r\nenough for me to come home, you know, whenever I wanted to.\" The record\r\nreveals Father's annual salary was $20,227 in 2009 and $23,697 in 2010. Because\r\nof Father's military service, he was not required to pay income taxes when in active\r\nservice. Additionally, his housing and food expenses were covered by the military,\r\nand Father admitted virtually all of his salary was disposable income. The only\r\nrecurring expenses Father mentioned were $20-25 per week for cigarettes and\r\ngoing to bars \"drinking with [his military] buddies, joking and having a good\r\ntime.\"\r\n35 There is conflicting evidence as to Father's reaction to this news. Father testified\r\nhe was \"very happy\" to learn they were expecting a child. However, Mother\r\ntestified Father \"didn't really have a reaction\" and \"every time [she] would bring it\r\nup, he really didn't say a whole lot.\" I find Mother's testimony more credible, as\r\nFather's lack of interest in his child and refusal to provide Mother any support\r\nstrongly corroborates her testimony as to Father's reaction to learning of the\r\npregnancy.\r\n\nIn the months thereafter, despite the Court's attempt to recast the facts in a light\r\nmore favorable to Father, he wanted nothing to do with the pregnancy and related\r\nresponsibilities. The couple's relationship became \"extremely distant\" and by June\r\n2009, they were no longer speaking to one another.36\r\n\r\nThroughout Mother's pregnancy, Father never offered to pay any of her medical or\r\nliving expenses or accompany her to any doctor's visits, even though he admitted\r\nhe was capable of doing so. According to Father, he would have given Mother\r\nsupport, but he \"never got[] anything from the state of Oklahoma for child\r\nsupport.\" Eventually, with Father abandoning parental responsibilities, Mother\r\nbroke off the relationship. Shortly thereafter, Mother sent Father a text message\r\ninquiring whether he wanted to support her and their child or relinquish his\r\nparental rights. Father sent a return text message to Mother expressly indicating\r\nhis desire to give up his parental rights.\r\n\r\nFather later claimed he would not have \"given up\" his parental rights had he known\r\nMother planned to place the baby for adoption. However, during Father's cross-\r\nexamination the following exchange took place:\r\n\r\n      Q. \t   But you were prepared to sign all your rights and\r\n             responsibilities away to this child just so as long as the mother\r\n             was taking care of the child?\r\n\r\n      A.     That's correct.\r\n             \t\r\n\r\n      Q. \t   And you would not be responsible in any way for the child\r\n             support or anything else as far as the child's concerned?\r\n\r\n      A.     \t orrect.\r\n             C\r\n\r\n      Q. \t   That's correct? Is that conducive to being a father?\r\n\r\n\r\n36According to the Guardian ad Litem's report, \"Phone records obtained by the\r\nGuardian confirm many texts coming into [Father's] telephone from the Birth\r\nMother's telephone number through the end of May,\" despite Father's claim that\r\nMother severed contact and would not respond to his repeated attempts to reach\r\nher.\r\n\n      A.     I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMother was already struggling financially as a single mother of two children, and\r\nshe knew it would be even more difficult to provide for a third child without help\r\nfrom Father. Mother testified she \"wanted [her] little girl to have a chance,\" and\r\nshe believed an adoption plan would be in the best interests of Baby Girl. Due to\r\nFather's stated disinterest in supporting or rearing the child, coupled with Mother's\r\nbelief that Father's verbal and written expressions effectively relinquished his\r\nparental rights, she did not inform Father that she planned for the child to be\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIn June 2009, Mother was introduced to Adoptive Couple (\"Appellants\") after she\r\ncontacted an adoption agency in Oklahoma. Appellants reside in Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, and have been married for six years. The couple received\r\ninfertility treatment for years and underwent seven unsuccessful in vitro\r\nfertilization attempts before deciding to adopt. Mother testified that she considered\r\nother families residing in Oklahoma, but she ultimately selected Appellants as an\r\nadoptive couple because they had values similar to her own and could provide\r\nBaby Girl a stable and loving home. In the weeks leading up to Baby Girl's birth,\r\nAppellants spoke to Mother weekly and traveled to Oklahoma to visit Mother in\r\nAugust 2009. Appellants helped support Mother during the last few months of her\r\npregnancy and shortly after Baby Girl's birth.\r\n\r\nBefore she gave birth, Mother informed the adoption agency she had Cherokee\r\nheritage and that she believed Father was an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation.\r\nMother provided her attorney with Father's correctly spelled name and location and\r\nwhat she believed to be his date of birth.37 Mother's attorney forwarded this\r\ninformation to Cherokee Nation in a letter dated August 21, 2009. The letter also\r\nstated Father was believed to be an enrolled member and inquired whether the tribe\r\nwould consider Baby Girl to be an \"Indian Child\" under ICWA. However, in the\r\nletter, Father's first name \"Dusten\" was misspelled \"Dustin,\" and his date of birth\r\nwas not accurate. Based on that incorrect information, Cherokee Nation replied in\r\na letter dated September 3, 2009, that the unborn baby could not be traced to tribal\r\nrecords and therefore would not be considered an \"Indian Child.\" However,\r\nCherokee Nation's letter also stated, \"This determination is based on the above\r\nlisted information exactly as provided by you. Any incorrect or omitted family\r\ndocumentation could invalidate this determination.\" Mother testified she told her\r\n\r\n37Mother testified she knew Father's birthday was in October and that he was older\r\nthan she was, so Father's year of birth was sometime before 1982.\r\n\nattorney the letter from Cherokee Nation was wrong and that Father was an\r\nenrolled member of the tribe; however, Mother admitted she did not know Father's\r\ncorrect birth date.38\r\n\r\nAppellants were present for Baby Girl's birth on September 15, 2009. Appellants\r\nwere in the delivery room when Mother gave birth to Baby Girl. Adoptive Father\r\ncut the umbilical cord.\r\n\r\nFather, however, did not appear at the hospital or attempt to contact Mother while\r\nshe was in the hospital.39 The following day, Mother signed forms relinquishing\r\nher parental rights and consenting to the adoption of Baby Girl. Baby Girl was\r\nplaced with Appellants shortly after her release from the hospital. Eight days after\r\nher birth, Appellants returned to South Carolina with Baby Girl.40\r\n\r\n38A trial, Cherokee Nation presented testimony of one of its employees as an\r\nexpert in Cherokee Indian culture and Cherokee child-rearing. The expert testified\r\nthat Cherokee names are often passed down and many members have the same\r\nname. According to the expert, the tribe uses \"birth date, name, something to get\r\nus somewhere close to see if a person is [an] enrolled [member].\"\r\n\r\nAt oral argument, counsel indicated Cherokee Nation has eight members with the\r\nfirst name \"Dustin\" or \"Dusten\" with the same last name as Father. It is unclear\r\nhow many of those eight members have the same middle name as Father or live in\r\nFort Sill, Oklahoma; however, when asked how many were born in the same\r\nmonth, counsel replied that she did not know, but that she \"guessed\" Father was the\r\nonly one. Counsel further explained, \"[Cherokee Nation] receive[s] possibly\r\nthousands of inquiries a year. Everyone in the country claims to be Cherokee. We\r\ncan't track down every letter we get.\" Notwithstanding this assertion by counsel,\r\nthe record includes correspondence from Cherokee Nation demonstrating that the\r\ntribe indeed responds to some inquiries with a follow-up request for additional\r\ninformation.\r\n39Father admitted he knew the expected due date and that there was only one\r\nhospital available for the birth. However, there was no evidence Father attempted\r\nto be present.\r\n40A prerequisite to Appellants removing the child from Oklahoma was receiving\r\nconsent from the State of Oklahoma pursuant to the Oklahoma Interstate Compact\r\non Placement of Children (ICPC). Mother provided the documentation; however,\r\nthe documentation reflected the child's race as \"Hispanic\" instead of \"Native\r\n\nAlthough he was aware of the anticipated due date, Father made no attempt to\r\ncontact Mother during the months after she gave birth to ask about Baby Girl, to\r\nrequest visitation, or to offer any gifts or financial support. According to Father's\r\nmother, she called Mother several times shortly after Baby Girl's birth to let her\r\nknow the family had some money and some gifts for the baby, but Mother did not\r\nreturn her phone calls. Mother denied receiving calls or visits from any of Father's\r\nfamily members.\r\n\r\nAppellants initiated adoption proceedings in Charleston, South Carolina, on\r\nSeptember 18, 2009.\r\n\r\nBecause Father had evaded all parental responsibilities, he did not learn that Baby\r\nGirl was placed for adoption until he was served with a copy of Appellants'\r\nadoption complaint on January 6, 2010, a fact that the majority somehow believes\r\ninures to Father's benefit.41 Father signed an acceptance of service stating that he\r\nwas the father of Baby Girl, that he was not contesting the adoption, and that he\r\nwaived the thirty-day waiting period and notice of hearing.\r\n\r\nOn January 11, 2010, Father requested a stay of the South Carolina adoption\r\nproceedings under the Servicemember's Civil Relief Act and three days later filed a\r\nsummons and complaint in an Oklahoma district court to establish paternity, child\r\ncustody, and support of the child. Father's complaint initially alleged that\r\n\"[n]either parent nor the children [sic] have [sic] Native American blood.\r\nTherefore the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act . . . do[es] not apply.\" The\r\ncomplaint was amended on April 19, 2010, to allege \"[b]oth the father and the\r\nchild have Native American blood. Therefore the Federal Indian Child Welfare\r\nAct . . . do[es] apply.\" The Oklahoma complaint named Appellants and Mother as\r\ndefendants. Father departed for Iraq on January 18, 2010, with his father acting as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican.\" Notably, this document was completed on September 21, 2009, after\r\nreceiving a letter dated Septemer 3, 2009, from Cherokee Nation indicating Baby\r\nGirl was not an Indian child and ICWA was not applicable. After the child was\r\ndischarged from the hospital, Appellants stayed in Oklahoma for approximately\r\neight days until they received ICPC approval.\r\n41The complaint was served on Father just days before he was deployed to Iraq for\r\napproximately twelve months. Father returned from Iraq on December 26, 2010.\r\n\npower of attorney while he was away. On June 28, 2010, the Oklahoma action was\r\ndismissed on jurisdictional grounds, as South Carolina was the child's home state.42\r\n\r\nAt some point during the pendency of the Oklahoma action, Cherokee Nation\r\nidentified Father as a registered member and determined that the child was an\r\nIndian Child, as defined by ICWA.43 On March 30, 2010, Appellants amended\r\ntheir South Carolina pleadings to acknowledge Father's membership in Cherokee\r\nNation. On April 7, 2010, Cherokee Nation filed a Notice of Intervention in the\r\nSouth Carolina action.\r\n\r\nThe case was tried in September of 2011. The interest of Baby Girl was\r\nrepresented by a Guardian ad Litem, who recommended that Father's rights be\r\nterminated and the adoption be approved.44 On November 25, 2011, a final order\r\nwas issued, in which the family court found ICWA applied and further that Father's\r\n\r\n42 Respondents challenge South Carolina's jurisdiction to hear this case, which is\r\nan improper effort to further litigate Father's unsuccessful Oklahoma action. Yet\r\nthis Court accepts Respondents' invitation to weigh in on the Oklahoma action and\r\ncastigate Appellants. No appeal was taken from the dismissal of the Oklahoma\r\naction, rendering the Oklahoma dismissal the law of the case. See Ulmer v. Ulmer,\r\n369 S.C. 486, 632 S.E.2d 858 (2006) (noting an unappealed ruling becomes law of\r\nthe case and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal). Before\r\nacknowledging this issue is not before us, the majority's superfluous discussion\r\nattributes nefarious motives to Appellants and refers to Baby Girl's transfer to\r\nSouth Carolina as improper. Again, Father, who ran away from parental\r\nresponsibilities, avoids any responsibility. I do not understand how an unwed birth\r\nfather who willfully abandons his child escapes even the slightest blame.\r\n43 An Indian child means \"any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is\r\neither (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian\r\ntribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\" 25 U.S.C. §\r\n1903(4).\r\n44I note the parties agreed that the family court would not consider the portions of\r\nthe Guardian ad Litem's report going to the ultimate issues to be decided—\r\nspecifically, the aspects of the report concerning the child's best interests and\r\ncustody recommendation. Likewise, I do not consider the Guardian ad Litem's\r\nultimate recommendations and emphasize that my findings of Baby Girl's best\r\ninterests are reached separately and independently.\r\n\nparental rights should not be terminated under South Carolina law. The family\r\ncourt denied Appellants' petition for adoption and transferred custody of Baby Girl\r\nto Father.                               III.\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nBased upon my de novo review of the record, the family court's findings are\r\naffected by several reversible errors. Specifically, the family court erred in finding\r\nAppellants failed to meet their burden of proving grounds for termination of\r\nFather's parental rights. As discussed in detail below, it was error to conclude that\r\nFather's failures to support and visit were not willful under state law. Father\r\nknowingly abandoned his parental responsibilities in every respect, including his\r\nwillful failure to contribute any support until token efforts were made well after\r\nthis adoption proceeding was underway. Yet, state law is not the only relevant\r\nconsideration; rather, state law must be considered along with the federal mandates\r\nsuperimposed by ICWA.                    A.\r\n\r\n                                Overview of ICWA\r\n\r\nICWA establishes \"minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children\r\nfrom their families,\" and applies to any child custody proceeding involving an\r\nIndian child. See 25 U.S.C. §§ 1902, 1903, 1911. Congress enacted ICWA in\r\nresponse to the \"rising concern in the mid-1970's over the consequences to Indian\r\nchildren, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive child welfare practices that\r\nresulted in the separation of large numbers of Indian children from their families\r\nand tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually in non-Indian\r\nhomes.\" Holyfield, 490 U.S. at 32. The legislative history of ICWA indicates\r\nCongress was concerned with \"'the wholesale removal of Indian children from\r\ntheir homes, the most tragic aspect of Indian life today.'\" Id. (quoting Indian Child\r\nWelfare Program, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs of the\r\nSenate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 3\r\n(statement of William Byler)). As one Tribal Chief testified, \"Indian children are\r\nremoved from the custody of their natural parents by nontribal government\r\nauthorities who have no basis for intelligently evaluating the cultural and social\r\npremises underlying Indian home life and childrearing. Many of the individuals\r\nwho decide the fate of our children are at best ignorant of our cultural values, and\r\n\nat worst contemptful of the Indian way and convinced that removal, usually to a\r\nnon-Indian household or institution, can only benefit an Indian child.\" Id. at 34\r\n(quoting Hearings on S. 1214 before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs and\r\nPublic Lands of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 95th Cong.,\r\n2d Sess., 191-92 (1978) (statement of Calvin Isaac, Tribal Chief of the Mississippi\r\nBand of Choctaw Indians and representative of the National Tribal Chairmen's\r\nAssociation)).\r\n\r\nThus, ICWA was intended to preserve tribal sovereignty and avoid the culturally\r\ninappropriate removal of Indian children based on the tendency of \"many social\r\nworkers, ignorant of Indian cultural values and social norms . . . [to] discover\r\nneglect or abandonment where none exists.\" H.R. Rep. No. 1386, at 22 (1978),\r\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7530, 7533.45 Accordingly, the express purpose of\r\nICWA is \"to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the\r\nstability and security of Indian tribes and families.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1902.\r\n\r\nHowever, almost forty years later, in struggling with the human reality of\r\nimplementing ICWA, courts frequently face competing tensions concerning an\r\nindividual child's personal and cultural identity. \"The grand narrative underlying\r\nthe Act, while born of a grim history of governmental destruction of Indian tribes,\r\nfamilies, and culture, sometimes has little direct correlation with the actual\r\ncircumstances of individual Indian children before state court judges.\" Barbara\r\nAnn Atwood, Flashpoints Under the Indian Child Welfare Act: Toward a New\r\n\r\n45 The House Report describes a particular aspect of Indian culture that is\r\nfrequently misunderstood:\r\n\r\n      [T]he dynamics of Indian extended families are largely\r\n      misunderstood. An Indian child may have scores of, perhaps more\r\n      than a hundred, relatives who are counted as close, responsible\r\n      members of the family. Many social workers, untutored in the ways\r\n      of Indian family life or assuming them to be socially irresponsible,\r\n      consider leaving the child with persons outside the nuclear family as\r\n      neglect and thus as grounds for terminating parental rights.\r\n\r\nH.R. Rep. No. 1386, at 22 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7530, 7533. At\r\ntrial, Cherokee Nation presented expert testimony that the involvement of extended\r\nfamily members in child-rearing is an aspect that is culturally unique to Cherokee\r\nIndians.\r\n\nUnderstanding of State Court Resistance, 51 Emory L.J. 587, 596 (2002). \"In any\r\nchild welfare case, it is essential that the decisionmaker be able to exercise\r\ndiscretion in arriving at a disposition that is most likely to protect the future\r\nwelfare of the unique child.\" Id. I would adopt this well-reasoned approach and\r\nreject the majority's approach of applying ICWA in a rigid, formulaic manner\r\nwithout regard to the facts of the particular case and the best interests of the Indian\r\nchild.46 I, unlike the majority, construe ICWA as allowing appropriate\r\nconsideration of compelling circumstances in a particular case which bear on the\r\nindividual child's physical, psychological, and social welfare.\r\n\r\n                                          B.\r\n\r\n                               Applicability of ICWA\r\n\r\nThe family court found ICWA was applicable. Specifically, the family court found\r\nCherokee Nation is an \"Indian Tribe,\" Baby Girl is an \"Indian Child,\" and Father is\r\na \"parent,\" as defined by ICWA. See 25 U.S.C. §§ 1903(4), (8)-(9).\r\n\r\nAppellants do not challenge the family court's findings that Cherokee Nation is an\r\n\"Indian Tribe\" and Baby Girl is an \"Indian Child.\" However, Appellants argue the\r\nfamily court erred in finding Father satisfies the ICWA definition of a \"parent.\"\r\nICWA defines a \"parent\" as:\r\n\r\n      any biological parent or parents of an Indian child or any Indian\r\n      person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child, including adoptions\r\n\r\n\r\n46 Were the issue before this Court, I would reject the existing Indian family\r\ndoctrine based on ICWA's clear statutory language in accordance with the modern\r\ntrend. See, e.g., In re Adoption of Baby Boy L., 643 P.2d 168, 175 (Kan. 1982) (\"It\r\nwas not to dictate that an illegitimate infant who has never been a member of an\r\nIndian home or culture, and probably never would be, should be removed from its\r\nprimary cultural heritage and placed in an Indian environment over the express\r\nobjections of its non-Indian mother.\"), overruled by In re A.J.S., 204 P.3d 543, 549\r\n(Kan. 2009) (abandoning existing Indian family doctrine based on a finding it was\r\n\"at odds with the clear language of ICWA\"). There is scant evidence that Father\r\never established significant social or cultural ties with Cherokee Nation. I give the\r\nabsence of such evidence no weight. The majority gives great weight to paternal\r\ngrandparents' ties with the Cherokee Nation.\r\n\n      under tribal law or customs. It does not include the unwed father\r\n      where paternity has not been acknowledged or established.\r\n\r\n25 U.S.C. § 1903(9) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the text, legislative history, and policy underlying ICWA\r\ndemonstrate that unwed fathers must show more than \"mere biology\" to invoke the\r\nprotections afforded to a parent under ICWA. ICWA does not expressly establish\r\nhow an unwed father must acknowledge or establish paternity. According to\r\nAppellants, courts should look to the particular state's statutory prescription for\r\nwhen a father's paternity has been acknowledged.\r\n\r\nLooking to South Carolina law, Father's consent to the adoption would not be\r\nrequired because he neither lived with Mother for a continuous period of six\r\nmonths before birth, nor contributed to her pregnancy-related expenses. As\r\nexplained more fully below, I would reverse the family court in this regard.47\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47 The Court could affirm the family court without upholding what I believe to be\r\nan egregiously erroneous determination that Father's rights would not be\r\nterminated under state law. By sidestepping the clear error of the family court, that\r\nis precisely what the Court has done. The indisputable fact is that Father provided\r\nno support to Mother during the pregnancy. Parental rights have been terminated\r\nunder South Carolina law where the biological parent did far more to grasp the\r\nopportunity of parenthood than Father. See Roe v. Reeves, 392 S.C. 143, 708\r\nS.E.2d 778 (2011) (finding father did not undertake a sufficient effort to make the\r\nsacrifices fatherhood demands where he bought pregnant mother sweatpants and t-\r\nshirt and offered to give mother $100, even though he attempted to visit mother in\r\nthe hospital and maintain contact with mother after birth); Doe v. Roe, 369 S.C.\r\n351, 631 S.E.2d 317 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding father's contributions to pregnant\r\nmother failed to meet general minimum standards of timely grasping the\r\nopportunity to assume full responsibility for his child where father contributed\r\napproximately $50, cigarettes, a pillow, and a few trips to fast food restaurants); cf.\r\nAbernathy v. Baby Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 437 S.E.2d 25 (1993) (finding father\r\ndemonstrated willingness to develop a full custodial relationship with his child\r\nwhere he attempted to provide monetary support to mother during pregnancy,\r\nendeavored to keep apprised of her progress during the pregnancy, and appeared at\r\nthe hospital and offered to pay medical expenses incurred from the birth).\r\n\nSpecifically, in South Carolina, where a child is placed with the prospective\r\nadoptive parents within six months of birth, an unwed father's consent is required\r\nonly if:\r\n\r\n      (a) the father openly lived with the child or the child's mother for a\r\n          continuous period of six months immediately preceding the\r\n          placement of the child for adoption, and the father openly held\r\n          himself out to be the father of the child during the six months\r\n          period; or\r\n\r\n      (b) the father paid a fair and reasonable sum, based on the father's\r\n          financial ability, for the support of the child or for expenses\r\n          incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy or with the\r\n          birth of the child, including, but not limited to, medical, hospital,\r\n          and nursing expenses.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-310(A)(5) (Supp. 2011); see also Reeves, 392 S.C. at 153,\r\n708 S.E.2d at 784 (\"It is not enough that the father simply have a desire to raise the\r\nchild; he must act on that interest and make the material contributions to the child\r\nand the mother during her pregnancy required of a father-to-be.\").\r\n\r\nBecause Father abandoned his child and would not be recognized as a putative\r\nfather under South Carolina law, Appellants claim Father cannot be considered a\r\nparent under ICWA and his consent to the adoption is not required. Although I\r\nagree with Appellants that Father abandoned Baby Girl and that his rights would\r\nbe terminated under state law without further inquiry, I nonetheless reject\r\nAppellants' contention that such a finding under state law precludes the application\r\nof ICWA to this case.\r\n\r\nAppellants conflate the issues of consent under state law and the definition of\r\n\"parent\" under ICWA. The issues of paternity and whether one's consent is\r\nrequired in an adoption proceeding are separate questions. It is beyond dispute that\r\nFather has acknowledged biological paternity from the time Mother first informed\r\nhim that she was pregnant. The fact that Father, from the beginning, ran from\r\nparental responsibilities cannot be used to challenge the issue of paternity.\r\nMoreover, Father admitted paternity in his pleadings in both the South Carolina\r\nand Oklahoma actions, and DNA testing conclusively established that he is the\r\nchild's biological father. Cf. In re Adoption of a Child of Indian Heritage, 543\r\nA.2d 925 (N.J. 1988) (finding putative father not an ICWA parent where father\r\nnever attempted to enforce his paternal rights, never commenced a proceeding to\r\n\nclaim such rights, and failed to acknowledge or establish paternity prior to the\r\nentry of the final judgment of adoption). I concur with the family court's finding\r\nthat Father meets the definition of parent under ICWA.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if Father had not acknowledged paternity here, ICWA nonetheless\r\nwould apply simply because Baby Girl is an Indian child. The Act's protections do\r\nnot stem only from a parent's status as such. Rather, ICWA's protections were\r\nspecifically designed to safeguard the interests and welfare of Indian children—not\r\njust parental rights.\r\n\r\nBecause ICWA applies and Father does not consent to the adoption, Appellants are\r\nrequired to prove grounds for terminating Father's parental rights and adoptive\r\nplacement in accordance with ICWA and state law.\r\n\r\n                                          C.\r\n\r\n                         Termination of Parental Rights\r\n\r\nThe majority avoids the family court's findings with respect to termination of\r\nFather's parental rights under state law. The family court held Appellants failed to\r\nprove by clear and convincing evidence the existence of any grounds to terminate\r\nFather's parental rights. Specifically, as concerns the state law considerations, the\r\nfamily court found Father's failure to visit and failure to support Baby Girl were\r\nnot willful. Additionally, as concerns ICWA considerations, the family court found\r\nAppellants failed to meet their burden of proving that continued custody by Father\r\nwas likely to result in serious emotional or physical harm to Baby Girl.\r\n\r\nAppellants argue they demonstrated that Father's failure to visit and failure to\r\nsupport was willful and that termination of Father's parental rights was in the best\r\ninterests of Baby Girl. I agree.\r\n\r\nUnlike the majority, my view is predicated upon the guiding principle that \"[t]he\r\nwelfare and best interests of the child are paramount in custody disputes.\"\r\nWoodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996); see also S.C.\r\nDep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 614 S.E.2d 642 (2005) (stating that\r\nthe best interests of the child are paramount to that of the parent in cases involving\r\ntermination of parental rights). Nothing evinces any Congressional intent to\r\ndisregard this cardinal rule in the context of ICWA; rather, Congress has expressly\r\ndeclared it is the policy of the United States to protect the best interests of Indian\r\nchildren. See 25 U.S.C. § 1902 (\"[I]t is the policy of this Nation to protect the best\r\n\ninterests of Indian children . . . .\"). Thus, \"ICWA's applicability does not mean that\r\nICWA replaces state law with regard to a child's best interests.\" L.N.B.-L., 237\r\nP.3d at 965 (emphasis added) (finding continuation of father's and mother's\r\nparental relationship would likely result in serious emotional damage to their\r\nchildren and thus, termination of parental rights was in children's best interests);\r\nsee also In re Dependency of A.A., 20 P.3d 492, 495-96 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001)\r\n(\"Regardless of the culture from which the parents come, when a termination\r\nproceeding is initiated in a Washington court, the best interests of the children at\r\nissue are paramount. . . . [T]he dominant consideration in a termination of parental\r\nrights is the moral, intellectual and material welfare of the child.\"); In re Interest of\r\nC.W., 479 N.W.2d 105, 114 (Neb. 1992) (stating \"ICWA does not change the\r\ncardinal rule that the best interests of the child are paramount\") (internal quotation\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\nTherefore, ICWA's applicability \"should not signal to state courts that state law is\r\nreplaced by the act's mandate.\" Mahaney, 51 P.3d at 785. Rather, ICWA\r\nenvisioned a symbiotic relationship between the additional protections of the Act\r\nand well-established state law principles for deciding custody matters in\r\naccordance with the best interests of the child. See Holyfield, 490 U.S. at 58\r\n(noting \"Congress did not intend to 'oust the States of their traditional jurisdiction\r\nover Indian children falling within their geographic limits'\" through enacting\r\nICWA) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-1386, at 19 (1978), reprinted in 1978\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 7530, 7541)). It is with these principles in mind that we should\r\ndetermine whether Appellants met their burden of showing that Father's parental\r\nrights should be terminated under both state law and federal law.48\r\n\r\n48The majority accuses me of ignoring the \"most salient feature of the Holyfield\r\ndecision, which is that the Supreme Court deferred to the tribe to decide what was\r\nin the best interest of those Indian children.\" I fully appreciate that the Supreme\r\nCourt ultimately deferred to the Choctaw Tribe in that instance; however, unlike\r\nthe majority, I recognize that such deference was afforded because the Indian\r\nchildren in Holyfield were required to be considered as domiciled on the\r\nreservation, and thus, the tribal courts were vested with exclusive jurisdiction to\r\nenter a decree of adoption pursuant to section 1911(a) of ICWA. See Holyfield,\r\n490 U.S. at 53. In my view, the majority construes this narrow holding in\r\nHolyfield to require unwavering deference to the tribe in all matters—not just those\r\nrelating to the power of tribal courts to adjudicate child custody proceedings vis-à­\r\nvis state courts where the Indian child is domiciled on the reservation. Indeed, the\r\nmajority conflates the issues of venue, tribal sovereign jurisdiction, and the\r\ncontrolling feature of substantive law regarding the protection of an Indian child's\r\n\n                                          1.\r\n\r\n                             Grounds for Termination\r\n\r\nThe family court found Father's failure to visit and support Baby Girl did not show\r\na settled purpose to forego his parental duties. These findings, especially as to\r\nFather's failure to support, are manifestly contrary to the evidence.\r\n\r\nRegarding visitation, the family court found the child's removal from Oklahoma,\r\nFather's subsequent deployment to Iraq, and the contested nature of the custody\r\nlawsuit hindered Father's ability to visit Baby Girl. Regarding support, the family\r\ncourt found that Father was a full-time member of the military, was capable of\r\nproviding support, but failed to offer any type of meaningful support to Mother or\r\nhis child prior to being served with the adoption lawsuit. Nonetheless, the family\r\ncourt concluded Father's failure to contribute any support was not willful. In this\r\nregard, the family court found significant that Appellants never sought support\r\nfrom Father, he was not under any court order to pay support, and that he began\r\n\r\n\r\nbest interests to justify its rigid view of ICWA's exclusive dominance in every\r\nrealm. However, because the application of section 1911(a) is not presently before\r\nthis Court, I find that Holyfield's protection of tribal sovereignty, although properly\r\nzealous in that instance, does not mandate absolute deference to the Cherokee\r\nNation's custody recommendations here.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I fail to see how my position would disregard any of the interests ICWA\r\naffords to the Tribe. See id. at 49 (\"The numerous prerogatives accorded the tribes\r\nthrough the ICWA's substantive provisions, e.g., §§ 1911(a) (exclusive jurisdiction\r\nover reservation domiciliaries), 1911(b) (presumptive jurisdiction over\r\nnondomiciliaries), 1911(c) (right of intervention), 1912(a) (notice), 1914 (right to\r\npetition for invalidation of state-court action), 1915(c) (right to alter presumptive\r\nplacement priorities applicable to state-court actions), 1915(e) (right to obtain\r\nrecords), 1919 (authority to conclude agreements with States), must, accordingly,\r\nbe seen as a means of protecting not only the interests of individual Indian children\r\nand families, but also of the tribes themselves.\"). None of the Tribe's rights\r\nestablished by ICWA and enumerated in Holyfield are implicated, much less\r\ndisregarded, here. Accordingly, I cannot understand the majority's continued\r\nemphasis on the primacy of tribal sovereignty as determinative of the outcome of\r\nthis action.\r\n\npaying child support when Baby Girl was sixteen months old.49 While section 63­\r\n7-2570 allows for consideration of \"requests for support by the custodian and the\r\nability of the parent to provide support[,]\" I would not give Father a reprieve on his\r\nfailure to pay support simply because Appellants did not seek support from\r\nsomeone who had repeatedly expressed disinterest in the child.50 Father's parental\r\nrights under South Carolina would have been terminated before Baby Girl was\r\nplaced with Appellants. Moreover, I would consider this factor alongside well-\r\nsettled law (discussed below) that a parent most certainly cannot excuse\r\nabandonment of parental responsibilities by claiming no one asked or demanded he\r\nor she act like a parent. See, e.g., Reeves, 392 S.C. at 152-53, 708 S.E.2d at 783\r\n(noting that if the mother wants the father to stay away, he must respect her wishes\r\nbut be sure that his support does not remain equally distant) (citing In re Adoption\r\nof M.D.K., 58 P.3d 745, 750-51 (Kan. Ct. App. 2002) (Beier, J., concurring)).\r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has issued a series of cases holding that the\r\nConstitution affords protection to an unwed father where the father has grasped the\r\nopportunity to be a parent; mere biology is not enough. See, e.g., Lehr v.\r\nRobertson, 463 U.S. 248 (1983) (holding failure to give putative father notice of\r\nadoption proceedings did not violate due process where he had never established a\r\nsubstantial relationship with his child).51 Essentially, \"[p]arental rights do not\r\nspring full-blown from the biological connection between parent and child. They\r\nrequire relationships more enduring.\" Id. at 260 (quoting Caban v. Mohamed, 441\r\nU.S. 380, 397 (1979) (Stewart, J., dissenting)). Thus, \"[w]hen an unwed father\r\ndemonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by 'coming\r\nforward to participate in the rearing of his child,' his interest in personal contact\r\n\r\n49 Beginning in February 2011, Father has intermittently sent checks to Appellants'\r\nattorney for the benefit of Baby Girl. According to the record, Father remitted\r\nseven checks totaling $1,500. The most recent payment was dated July 7, 2011.\r\n50This is particularly so in light of the evidence at trial indicating Father refused to\r\nprovide Mother with pre-birth financial assistance.\r\n51Lehr was preceded by Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972) (holding due\r\nprocess was violated by the automatic rejection of an unwed father's custodial\r\nrelationship without granting the father opportunity to present evidence regarding\r\nhis fitness as a parent), and Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246 (1978) (denying\r\nconstitutional protection to unwed father who had manifested only limited interest\r\nin his children).\r\n\nwith his child acquires substantial protection under the due process clause.\" Id. at\r\n261 (quoting Caban, 441 U.S. at 392). \"[M]ere existence of a biological link does\r\nnot merit equivalent constitutional protection.\" Id. \"If [a natural father] grasps the\r\nopportunity\" to develop a relationship with his child and \"accepts some measure of\r\nresponsibility for the child's future, he may enjoy the blessings of the parent-child\r\nrelationship and make uniquely valuable contributions to the child's development.\"\r\nId. at 262. \"If he fails to do so, the Federal Constitution will not automatically\r\ncompel a state to listen to his opinion of where the child's best interests lie.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of these principles, South Carolina similarly requires an unwed\r\nfather's parental rights to be predicated upon some involvement in the child's life.\r\nThus, if an unwed father fails to undertake parental responsibility, as in this case,\r\nhis parental rights are jeopardized. A family court may terminate parental rights\r\nupon clear and convincing evidence of at least one enumerated statutory ground\r\nand a finding that termination is in the best interests of the child. S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\nServs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003) (citing Santosky\r\nv. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982)).\r\n\r\nA parent's rights may be terminated if:\r\n\r\n         (3) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period\r\n         of six months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed to\r\n         visit the child. . . . The distance of the child's placement from the\r\n         parent's home must be taken into consideration when determining the\r\n         ability to visit.\r\n\r\n         (4) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period\r\n         of six months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed to\r\n         support the child. . . . The court may consider all relevant\r\n         circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has willfully\r\n         failed to support the child, including requests for support by the\r\n         custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added). Willful conduct is\r\nthat which \"evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties . . . because it\r\nmanifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and\r\nconsortium from the parent.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53,\r\n413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992).52\r\n\r\n52   Although compliance with the literal requirements of section 63-7-2570 is\r\n\nBased on my de novo review of the evidence, Father's failure to visit Baby Girl\r\nwas willful. Father made no meaningful effort to establish a relationship with\r\nBaby Girl when there was ample opportunity for him to do so. To the contrary, he\r\navoided any rights and responsibilities to the child. As noted, on repeated\r\noccasions, Father expressed his willingness to sign away his parental rights.53\r\nMoreover, while Father was in Iraq until December 2010, Father failed to request\r\nvisitation until he was deposed in this case. At the time of his request, Baby Girl\r\nwas twenty-two months old, and Father had returned from active duty seven\r\nmonths earlier.54\r\n\r\n\r\nusually required, there are instances in which a father's inability to undertake\r\nspecific acts to preserve his parental relationship with his child may be excused,\r\nsuch as where an unwed father timely demonstrates a willingness to develop a\r\nrelationship with his child but is thwarted from doing so by the refusal of the\r\nchild's mother to accept his expressions of interest and commitment. See\r\nAbernathy, 313 S.C. at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29 (finding an \"unwed father is entitled to\r\nconstitutional protection not only when he meets the literal requirements of section\r\n[63-7-2570], but also when he undertakes sufficient prompt and good faith efforts\r\nto assume a parental responsibility and to comply with the statute\"). Here, the\r\nfamily court properly found Father was not entitled to the protection of the\r\n\"thwarted father\" exception because there is no evidence indicating he attempted to\r\ncontribute to the support of his child during Mother's pregnancy or after the child's\r\nbirth.\r\n53 The majority correctly notes that Father's various written and verbal expressions\r\nwishing to give up his parental rights were not legally binding. I do not understand\r\nwhy the majority undertakes such a substantial discussion of this issue, for no one\r\nhas ever contended those expressions were legally binding. I do not equate them\r\nwith valid legal consent to this adoption. Yet, at least to me, Father's clear\r\nexpressions speak volumes about the element of willfulness in his abandonment of\r\nBaby Girl. Moreover, the relevance of this evidence to the issue of Baby Girl's\r\nbest interests is self-evident. In my view, the revocability of a parent's consent\r\nunder section 1913 of ICWA, to which the majority refers, does not render\r\nirrelevant a parent's repeated expressions of unwillingness and disinterest in\r\nparenting.\r\n54According to Father, he never sent any cards or letters seeking progress reports\r\non Baby Girl because he was unsure of whether he might be \"going against any\r\nlegal rights or anything like that. I didn't want to break the law.\"\r\n\nI would also find that Father's failure to support Baby Girl was willful. I find the\r\ncredible evidence shows Mother immediately informed Father of her pregnancy\r\nand requested financial assistance, but Father neither offered nor assisted Mother\r\nwith either the pregnancy or with the medical costs associated with pregnancy and\r\nbirth. According to Father, he would have paid child support if he had received a\r\ncourt order directing him to do so or if Mother had requested support and agreed to\r\nmarry him.\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike the family court, I find Father's purported willingness to provide\r\nsupport changes nothing. The suggestion that an unwed father's duty to support his\r\nchild is conditioned on marriage, a formal plea from the mother or official state\r\naction is transparently frivolous. Further, Father's claimed willingness to provide\r\nsupport is of no moment for he did not actually provide any support and cannot\r\ndemonstrate any legitimate excuse for failing to do so. As this Court recently\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n      [An unwed father] must provide support regardless of whether his\r\n      relationship with the mother-to-be continues or ends. He must do this\r\n      regardless of whether the mother-to-be is willing to have any type of\r\n      contact with him whatsoever or submit to his emotional or physical\r\n      control in any way.\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      He must not be deterred by the mother-to-be's lack of romantic\r\n      interest in him, even by her outright hostility. If she justifiably or\r\n      unjustifiably wants him to stay away, he must respect her wishes but\r\n      be sure that his support does not remain equally distant.\r\n\r\nReeves, 392 S.C. at 152-53, 708 S.E.2d at 783 (quoting In re Adoption of M.D.K.,\r\n58 P.3d at 750-51).\r\n\r\nFurther, we are not constrained to consider only Father's recent conduct towards\r\nBaby Girl. Rather, the \"court is able to look beyond the months immediately\r\npreceding the [termination of parental rights] action at the [parent's] overall\r\nconduct.\" Headden, 354 S.C. at 612-13, 582 S.E.2d at 425. \"While a parent's\r\ncurative conduct after initiation of an action for termination of parental rights may\r\nbe considered by the court on the issue of intent, it must be considered in light of\r\n\nthe timeliness by which it occurred.\" Abercrombie v. LaBoon, 290 S.C. 35, 38,\r\n348 S.E.2d 170, 171-72 (1986). \"Rarely would this judicially motivated\r\nrepentance, standing alone, warrant a finding that an abandonment had been\r\ncured.\" Id. at 38, 348 S.E.2d at 172.\r\n\r\nFather failed to pay any child support until Baby Girl reached sixteen months of\r\nage and did so inconsistently and in an insubstantial amount.55 As I have\r\npreviously stated, the eventual payments of child support and isolated request for\r\nvisitation are untimely, and I find them to be judicially motivated repentance\r\nfalling short of curative conduct. See Reeves, 392 S.C. at 153, 708 S.E.2d at 784\r\n(\"[A] father's attempts to assert his parental rights are insufficient to protect his\r\nrelationship with the minor child 'unless accompanied by a prompt, good-faith\r\neffort to assume responsibility for either a financial contribution to the child's\r\nwelfare or assistance in paying for the birth mother's pregnancy or childbirth\r\nexpenses.'\"); Doe v.

The family court's findings in this regard are error. I would terminate\r\nFather's parental rights under state law, specifically section 63-7-2570 (3) and (4).\r\n\r\n                                         2.\r\n\r\n                            Best Interests of the Child\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the decision of the family court judge was influenced to some\r\nextent by the erroneous legal conclusion that ICWA eclipses the family court's\r\n\r\n55According to his own testimony, the amount Father has set aside for child\r\nsupport since Baby Girl's birth is roughly equal to the amount he spends on\r\ncigarettes in a single year.\r\n\nobligation to determine what would be in the child's best interests. In light of this\r\nerror of law and based upon my review of the record, I would hold that it is in\r\nBaby Girl's best interests for Father's parental rights to be terminated.\r\n\r\n\"[T]he welfare of the child and what is in his/her best interest is the primary,\r\nparamount and controlling consideration of the court in all child custody\r\ncontroversies.\" Davis v. Davis, 356 S.C. 132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103-04 (2003).\r\nThe Court acknowledges this settled principle but ignores it in application.56 \"The\r\nfamily court must consider the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations on the\r\npart of each parent as they impact the child.\" Woodall, 322 S.C. at 11, 471 S.E.2d\r\nat 157. \"In addition, psychological, physical, environmental, spiritual, educational,\r\nmedical, family, emotional, and recreational aspects of the child's life should be\r\nconsidered.\" Id. As I have previously noted, \"ICWA's applicability does not mean\r\nthat ICWA replaces state law with regard to a child's best interests.\" In re Welfare\r\nof L.N.B.-L, 237 P.3d at 965. Moreover ICWA's applicability \"should not signal to\r\nstate courts that state law is replaced by the act's mandate,\" In re Mahaney, 51 P.3d\r\nat 785. Therefore, I consider the best interests of Baby Girl in light of the\r\nsymbiotic relationship between the ICWA and well-established state law\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian ad Litem appointed to represent the interests of Baby Girl reported\r\nthat Adoptive Mother has made her career as a specialist in child development and\r\nworks from home, which allows interaction with Baby Girl throughout the day.\r\nMoreover, the Guardian found Appellants are child-focused and family-oriented,\r\nand Baby Girl has thrived in their care. The Guardian conducted a home visit in\r\nOklahoma with Father and paternal grandparents. The Guardian found Father's\r\nfamily \"appears to genuinely care for each other\" and that it was the family's desire\r\nto receive the child into their home. However, the Guardian expressed concerns\r\nregarding Father were he to assume a role as primary caregiver. The Guardian\r\ntestified about her concerns that Father chose to leave active military service\r\nwithout first arranging full-time civilian employment. Further, the Guardian noted\r\n\r\n\r\n56 The Court notes \"that even under South Carolina law, we do not terminate\r\nparental rights merely because a parent is not a perfect parent.\" I agree, as this is\r\nsimply another example of the majority attributing to me a position I do not take.\r\nIt is clear to me from the totality of the majority's analysis that its application of\r\nICWA has eviscerated any meaningful consideration of Baby Girl's best interests,\r\ndespite its lip service to this settled principle.\r\n\nFather has not developed a parenting plan that would enable him to provide for his\r\nchildren beyond that which is afforded by his parents.57\r\n\r\nAdditionally, consideration of Father's behavior as it relates to the statutory\r\ngrounds for termination is appropriate for purposes of the best interests\r\ndetermination because his conduct \"evinces a settled purpose to forego parental\r\nduties.\" Headden, 354 S.C. at 610, 582 S.E.2d at 423 (citation omitted). Although\r\nI recognize Father began intermittently paying child support when Baby Girl was\r\nsixteen months old, and sought visitation when she was twenty-two months old,\r\nconsistent with our existing jurisprudence, I find that these actions \"came too late.\"\r\nId. at 611, 582 S.E.2d at 423. By the time Father began these efforts to undertake\r\nhis parental responsibilities, Baby Girl had already developed a substantial bond\r\nwith Appellants in the first critical months in her life. Baby Girl's overriding\r\ninterest in stability and continuity of care must remain in the forefront of this\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the evidence which supports the statutory grounds for willful failure\r\nto visit and support, I also note Father's parental history with his other minor\r\ndaughter, which reflects a disregard to fulfill parental obligations. The mother of\r\nhis first child was forced to take court action after Father had amassed a child\r\nsupport arrearage of approximately $11,000. Given the totality of the evidence,\r\nplacement with Father is not in Baby Girl's best interests. Father's established\r\nabandonment of parental responsibilities signifies \"that he is consciously\r\nindifferent to the rights—and emotional needs—of his infant daughter . . . .\" Doe\r\nv. Roe, 386 S.C.624, 633, 690 S.E.2d 573, 578 (2010).\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Appellants have provided Baby Girl a loving, nurturing, and stable\r\nhome. The evidence of their parental fitness is overwhelming. State law is clear\r\nthat it is the child's interests which shall prevail. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570.\r\nAccordingly, I conclude placement with Appellants would serve the best interests\r\nof Baby Girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57The portions of the report upon which I rely relate only to the Guardian ad\r\nLitem's factual observations of Father's conduct and concerns about his parenting\r\nabilities. Those portions are unrelated to any disparity in education and wealth\r\nbetween Father's family and Appellants.\r\n\n                                         3.\r\n\r\n                        Heightened Protections of ICWA\r\n\r\nWere the termination of Father's parental rights determined solely under state law,\r\nthere would be no further inquiry. However, through ICWA, Congress has\r\nspecifically afforded heightened protections in a termination of parental rights\r\naction. I discuss each of these protections in turn.\r\n\r\n                                         a.\r\n\r\n                            Emotional Harm to Child\r\n\r\n\r\nICWA prohibits the termination of parental rights \"in the absence of a\r\ndetermination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including\r\ntestimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by\r\nthe parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical\r\ndamage to the child.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1912(f). The beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\r\nstandard is different than the clear-and-convincing burden of proof required under\r\nstate law. Thus, in an Indian child custody proceeding to which ICWA applies, a\r\ndual burden of proof must be met before a parent's rights may be terminated: the\r\ncourt must find beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody of the child by\r\nthe parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child,\r\nand the court must also find that clear and convincing evidence supports\r\ntermination under the applicable state statutory ground. Accord In re Elliot, 554\r\nN.W.2d 32 (Mich. Ct. App. 1996) (finding in a child custody proceeding involving\r\nan Indian child, a dual burden of proof must be met); In re Bluebird, 411 S.E.2d\r\n820, 823 (N.C. Ct. App. 1992) (finding \"a dual burden of proof is created in which\r\nthe state provisions and federal provisions must be satisfied separately\"); In re\r\nD.S.P., 480 N.W.2d 234 (Wis. 1992) (finding the goals of ICWA and goals of state\r\nlaw are properly harmonized through requiring a dual burden of proof).\r\n\r\nThe family court found Appellants failed to prove that Father's custody of Baby\r\nGirl was likely to result in serious emotional or physical harm to the child. Noting\r\nAppellants' expert did not interview Father and had never before conducted a\r\nbonding evaluation on an Indian child, the family court gave little weight to his\r\nexpert testimony. The family court further reasoned that the testimony was entitled\r\nto little weight because Appellants' expert considered only the damage resulting\r\nfrom Baby Girl's removal from Appellants' care—not the harm caused by\r\n\nplacement with Father. The family court relied heavily on the testimony of an\r\nemployee of Cherokee Nation, who testified as to Cherokee Nation's position\r\nregarding termination of Father's parental rights.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the court found Father has a \"demonstrated\" ability to parent\r\neffectively58 and, therefore, is a fit and proper person to have custody of Baby Girl.\r\nDespite acknowledging that Appellants would surely be excellent parents were\r\nBaby Girl to remain in their custody, the family court concluded Appellants failed\r\nto meet their burden of proving Father's continued custody of Baby Girl would\r\nresult in severe emotional harm to the child. The family court's conclusion that\r\nAppellants failed to satisfy section 1912(f) was error.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Appellants presented the testimony of Dr. Bart Saylor, a qualified expert\r\nin familial bonding who conducted a bonding evaluation of Appellants and Baby\r\nGirl, testified that both adoptive parents seemed very well-adjusted, Baby Girl was\r\na healthy little girl, and there was a strong emotional and psychological bond\r\nbetween them. He testified that severing the bond Baby Girl has formed with\r\nAppellants would, beyond a reasonable doubt, be \"very traumatic\" and \"very\r\ndisruptive\" for the child. He further opined that severing that bond could produce\r\n\"depression, anxiety, [and] it could cause disruption in [Baby Girl's] capacity to\r\nform relationships at a later age.\" Dr. Saylor concluded that her removal would\r\n\"be taking away everything that she had come to know and count on for her\r\ncomfort and security and replace it with something that would be completely\r\nunfamiliar and strange to her.\" Dr. Saylor further articulated that \"it's not a matter\r\nof an alternative being favorable or unfavorable, you know, better or worse. It's\r\njust taking away what has been the very source and foundation of her security in\r\nher life . . . .\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked during cross examination his opinion about Baby Girl's ability to bond\r\nwith her biological family, Dr. Saylor testified that the fact that Baby Girl is\r\nhealthy and happy bodes well for her resilience; however, he quickly cautioned\r\nthat a substantial source of such health was her healthy and stable relationship with\r\nAppellants. In fact, Dr. Saylor stated the bond is \"a good resource in this child's\r\npsychological armament, but all the more sense of loss and disruption of losing\r\nthat\" will occur if the bond is severed.59\r\n\r\n58   This finding contains no support in the record.\r\n59   Dr. Saylor further explained:\r\n\nDr. Saylor admitted he was unfamiliar with any specific studies suggesting a\r\npattern of harm suffered by Native American adolescents who were raised by non-\r\nIndian adoptive families; he nevertheless testified that he would find such broad-\r\nbased presumptions of \"minimal utility in making that sort of a risk-assessment\r\nprediction.\" Although not discounting the significance of cultural heritage, Dr.\r\nSaylor noted that in terms of a child's bond with her caregiver, \"it wouldn't have\r\nany relevance one way or the other to this bonding assessment, whether it was\r\nNative American, African American, European [heritage], that—that would not be\r\nthe issue.\" Essentially, the relevant consideration in a bonding assessment is the\r\nfamily unit—the bond among the unique individuals, which is not necessarily\r\ndefined by their cultural identity. Rather, according to Dr. Saylor, \"the real\r\nvariable that determines [children's] happiness and their success and their identity\r\nis that loving interaction with [their] family.\" Dr. Saylor ultimately opined that he\r\nbelieved beyond a reasonable doubt that the removal of Baby Girl from Appellants\r\ncare would cause serious emotional harm. I find Dr. Saylor's testimony is credible\r\nand persuasive.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Cherokee Nation, Tiffany Dunaway, an employee and case worker\r\nwith the tribe, testified the tribe's recommendation was for Baby Girl to be placed\r\nwith her natural father.60 Dunaway was qualified as an expert in Cherokee Indian\r\nculture and Cherokee Indian practices. Dunaway received a bachelor's degree in\r\nfamily life education, but she has no formal training on bonding and attachment.\r\nIn preparation for trial, she never met or evaluated Baby Girl or Appellants and she\r\n\r\n\r\n      Could it be that if she'd had multiple caregivers and the bond was less\r\n      well established, it might be easier for her to make another transition,\r\n      I mean, possibly so. She might not be as healthy and happy a child on\r\n      the surface, but making the transition might be easier. But I just don't\r\n      think you can say that because she's happy and has been a well-cared\r\n      for child that that would make it easier. I think it could actually make\r\n      it harder.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n60The bulk of Ms. Dunaway's testimony concerns the preference of Cherokee\r\nNation regarding Baby Girl's adoptive placement. However, section 1912(f) does\r\nnot contemplate the consideration of tribal preference in determining harm suffered\r\nby the child.\r\n\nmet Father only once briefly. Additionally, Dunaway admitted that she had never\r\nseen Father interact with any child of any age. Nevertheless, Dunaway was certain\r\nthat Baby Girl would do well in Father's custody and would not be permanently\r\nharmed by severance of the bond Baby Girl has established with Appellants.\r\nDunaway admitted she had no information about Father's ability to parent;\r\nnonetheless, she testified, \"I have no doubt that this father [can] raise his child.\"\r\nDunaway's opinion was based on a home visit she conducted with Father and\r\npaternal grandparents and a separate home study of the paternal grandparents,\r\nconducted while Father was not residing there.61 Further, Dunaway acknowledged\r\nher opinion that Baby Girl would thrive if placed in that home was based on\r\nanecdotal experience alone. Dunaway admitted she was unaware of any studies\r\nthat show the percentage of transitioned children who thrive long-term following\r\nreunification with their Indian families. On cross-examination, the following\r\nexchange took place:\r\n\r\n      Q. \t   When you said yesterday that Baby Girl would just do\r\n             wonderful at [Father's], you really don't know that for sure, do\r\n             you?\r\n\r\n      A. \t   And—and I think I said that. I think I said, you know, we don't\r\n             know what the future is going to be. I've transitioned children\r\n             her age and that are older than her and they thrive. They've\r\n             done well. So I can only go off of my experience on that.\r\n\r\n      Q. \t   Your personal experience?\r\n\r\n      A\t     Yes, through work.\r\n\r\n      Q\t     And—and you've not had any children who didn't thrive?\r\n\r\n\r\n61Dunaway distinguished a \"home assessment,\" which she conducted in this case,\r\nfrom a \"full-blown home study,\" which she acknowledged she is not qualified to\r\nperform without additional training and certification. It appears the home study of\r\npaternal grandparents was conducted by another employee of Cherokee Nation for\r\nthe purpose of approving paternal grandparents as an alternative placement during\r\nFather's military service. Dunaway explained that a home study of Father was not\r\nconducted because \"[the tribe] didn't need one on him,\" notwithstanding her\r\nadmission that the tribe had no information regarding Father's ability to parent.\r\n\nA. \t   You know, I've had children who've had difficult times.\r\n\r\nQ. \t   How many? Because yesterday you said they all were\r\n       successful.\r\n\r\nA. \t   I – you know, well they—they are successful. I think the\r\n       children are thriving. I think there are a couple of girls who\r\n       were—they're—I think they're 12 and 8 now. At first they were\r\n       needing counseling. They, you know, they were older.\r\n\r\nQ. \t   Right. I don't want to get into anecdotal. Give me statistics.\r\n\r\nA. \t   I don't have those.\r\n\r\nQ. \t   Give me some hard statistics and don't tell me personal stories.\r\n       Tell me how many children are not thriving?\r\n\r\nA. \t   I don't have those.\r\n\r\nQ. \t   Why wouldn't you?\r\n\r\nA. \t   I don't keep those.\r\n\r\nQ. \t   You don't really know, do you?\r\n\r\nA. \t   I don't keep those things.\r\n\r\nQ. \t   You don't know. So yesterday when you said they were all\r\n       successful you don't really know how many of those are\r\n       successful today, do you?\r\n\r\nA.     No, I don't.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nQ. \t   But as you sit here today to testify you don't really have any\r\n       studies completed or in your file in terms of a two-year old\r\n       being taken out of a primary caregiver's home, a two-year old\r\n       who only knows this couple as [] their only psychological\r\n       parent, her only psychological parent, you don't have any\r\n\n             studies in your file as to how the children you've monitored\r\n             have done when they've been ripped out of an adoptive family's\r\n             home and placed into someone's she doesn't even know?\r\n\r\n      A. \t   I can only testify as to my experience.\r\n\r\n             [witness instructed by court to answer the question]\r\n\r\n      A. \t   No, we do not have statistics. And the Tribe may have\r\n             statistics; I don't have them. I can just—So, no, I do not have\r\n             them.\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      Q. \t   So you're prepared to say that this child who has never been\r\n             with the biological father should be removed from the home\r\n             that this child was—the only home that this child has known\r\n             and put into an entirely strange environment with a father where\r\n             there's no information about his ability to parent?\r\n\r\n      A.     Yes.\r\n             \t\r\n\r\nYet the family court was persuaded, as is the majority, by Dunaway's testimony.\r\nWhile I believe Dunaway's testimony reflects insight into Cherokee Nation's\r\ntraditions and an understanding of the importance of cultural heritage in an Indian\r\nchild's development, with respect, I find Dunaway's views, expressed as a\r\nrepresentative of Cherokee Nation regarding the tribe's placement\r\nrecommendation, are not persuasive in this case as they relate to the determination\r\nof whether Baby Girl would suffer harm if removed from Appellants' custody.\r\nFurther, in light of her lack of expertise in the area of bonding, her lack of\r\ninteraction with Baby Girl and Father, and her reliance on purely anecdotal\r\nevidence, I find Dunaway's opinion regarding Baby Girl's emotional well-being\r\nlacks credibility. See In re Robert T. v. Devon T., 246 Cal. Rptr. 168 (Cal. Ct. App.\r\n1988) (approving the family court's failure to give weight to an expert witness's\r\ntestimony regarding lack of harm to child when witness had never met child or\r\nadoptive family). Thus, on the whole, I find Dunaway's testimony unpersuasive.\r\n\r\nRespondents argue Dr. Saylor's expert testimony should have been excluded\r\nbecause he was not a qualified expert under ICWA due to his lack of knowledge\r\nspecifically related to Indian culture. I reject Respondents' contention that Dr.\r\nSaylor was not properly qualified as an expert. While I acknowledge testimony of\r\n\nan expert witness who possesses knowledge of Indian culture may be helpful, it is\r\nnot required by section 1912(f). Moreover, where the basis for termination of\r\nparental rights is unrelated to Indian culture, the need for expert testimony\r\npossessing a familiarity with such culture becomes less crucial. See Marcia V. v.\r\nState, 302 P.3d 494, 504 (Alaska 2009) (stating \"when the basis for termination is\r\nunrelated to Native culture and society and when any lack of familiarity with\r\nculture mores will not influence the termination decision or implicate cultural bias\r\nin the termination proceeding, the qualifications of an expert testifying under §\r\n1912(f) need not include familiarity with Native culture\"); see also Bureau of\r\nIndian Affairs (\"BIA\") Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody\r\nProceedings, 44 Fed. Reg. 67594 (1979) (indicating expert testimony by someone\r\nthat has knowledge of tribal cultural and childrearing practices may be valuable to\r\na court, but is not required). Furthermore, I see no basis for finding that severing\r\nthe bond between a two-year old Indian child and the only caregivers she has ever\r\nknown would be less traumatic and disruptive than if the child were a non-Indian.62\r\n\r\n62The majority finds it would be inappropriate to consider the bonding that\r\noccurred between Baby Girl and Appellants during litigation, and cites Holyfield in\r\nsupport of this finding. However, I view this as another instance in which the\r\nmajority misapprehends that opinion.\r\n\r\nIn Holyfield, the adoptive parents argued the bonding which took place during the\r\npendency of the litigation defeated the tribe's exclusive jurisdiction. The United\r\nStates Supreme Court found the express language of section 1911(a) could not be\r\nignored in spite of the potential finding of the tribal court upon remand that the\r\nIndian children should be removed from their non-Indian adoptive home. In that\r\nvein, the Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n      Whatever feelings we might have as to where the twins should live,\r\n      however, it is not for us to decide that question. We have been asked\r\n      to decide the legal question of who should make the custody\r\n      determination concerning these children—not what the outcome of\r\n      that determination should be. The law places that decision in the\r\n      hands of the Choctaw tribal court. Had the mandate of [section\r\n      1911(a) of] the ICWA been followed in 1986, of course, much\r\n      potential anguish might have been avoided, and in any case the law\r\n      cannot be applied so as automatically to \"reward those who obtain\r\n      custody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it during any\r\n      ensuing (and protracted) litigation.\" It is not ours to say whether the\r\n      trauma that might result from removing these children from their\r\n\nI also find the family court improperly interpreted section 1912(f)'s \"damage\" as\r\nencompassing only long-term harm. Section 1912(f) contains no such limitation\r\non the damage requirement. By its terms, section 1912(f) requires only proof of\r\nserious emotional or physical harm to the child. I believe this particular provision\r\nof ICWA is designed specifically to protect the best interests of the child, which\r\nnecessarily includes the child's short-term well-being. This does not mean,\r\nhowever, long-term considerations are irrelevant. Dr. Saylor opined that severing\r\nthe bond between Baby Girl and Appellants had the potential to negatively affect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      adoptive family should outweigh the interest of the Tribe—and\r\n      perhaps the children themselves—in having them raised as part of the\r\n      Choctaw community. Rather, \"we must defer to the experience,\r\n      wisdom, and compassion of the [Choctaw] tribal courts to fashion an\r\n      appropriate remedy.\"\r\n\r\nHolyfield, 490 U.S. at 53-54 (quoting In re Adoption of Halloway, 732 P.2d 962,\r\n971-72 (1986) (\"While stability in child placement should be a parmount value, it\r\ncannot be the sole yardstick by which the legality of a particular custodial\r\narrangement is judged. . . . In any event, here we have no choice in the matter:\r\n[section 1911(a)] prohibits the Utah courts from exercising jurisdiction. Instead,\r\nwe must defer to the experience, wisdom, and compassion of the Navajo tribal\r\ncourts to fashion an appropriate remedy. We hope the tribal courts will consider\r\nthe tribe's slow response to the notice of the Utah adoption proceedings as well as\r\nthe value of stability in child placement and will recognize the strong bonds [child]\r\nhas developed with his adoptive parents. . . . [W]e are confident that the courts of\r\nthe Navajo Nation will give the petition for adoption the careful attention it\r\ndeserves and will act with the utmost concern for [child's] well-being.\") (emphasis\r\nadded)).\r\n\r\nFurther, I note that, following remand to the tribal court in Holyfield, the Choctaw\r\ntribal court judge balanced the tribe's interests in preserving tribal communities\r\nagainst the children's interests in continuity and stability, and concluded it was in\r\nthe children's best interests to remain with the non-Indian adoptive parent. See\r\nMaldonado, supra, at 17-18. This lends further support for the proposition that the\r\nbest interests inquiry is not ousted by ICWA and that bonding is a highly relevant\r\nconsideration.\r\n\nBaby Girl as an adult. However, Dr. Saylor candidly acknowledged that long-term\r\neffects of such traumas are subject to a host of varying factors and are therefore\r\nunpredictable.63\r\n\r\nFinally, I find the family court erred in discounting Dr. Saylor's testimony because\r\nhe attributed Baby Girl's emotional harm to only her removal from Appellants' care\r\nand not her return to Father's care. Initially, although Father never assumed or\r\nsought physical custody of Baby Girl, I recognize, as have other courts, that\r\n\"continued custody\" under section 1912(f) refers not only to physical custody, but\r\nlegal custody as well.64 See D.J. v. P.C., 36 P.3d 663 (Alaska 2001) (noting\r\nsection 1912 termination provisions are applicable even where parent never had\r\nphysical custody but whose custodial rights had not been terminated); In re\r\nAdoption of a Child of Indian Heritage, 543 A.2d 925, 938 (N.J. 1988) (\"[T]he\r\nreference to 'custody' in section 1914 refers to a parent's legal, rather than physical,\r\nrelationship with a child.\"). Nonetheless, it is apparent from the circumstances\r\nbefore us that section 1912 must be applied in the context of the facts of the\r\nparticular case. The critical feature here is that Father deliberately avoided\r\ndeveloping a parent-child relationship with Baby Girl. Thus, no father-daughter\r\nrelationship exists upon which to base an evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63 Respondents additionally suggested through cross-examination of Dr. Saylor that\r\nhis testimony should be discounted because he refused to \"conclusively\" testify\r\nthat Baby Girl would suffer \"irreparable harm\" if Father were awarded custody. I\r\nreject this effort to discount Dr. Saylor's testimony. The statute imposes a beyond\r\na reasonable doubt standard and speaks in terms of \"serious harm,\" not irreparable\r\nharm. In addition, I find Dr. Saylor's measured responses and caution against\r\nmaking broad generalizations reflective of an objective and credible expert\r\nwitness. Dr. Saylor's measured responses and candor are refreshing when\r\ncontrasted with the \"all in\" expert, like Dunaway.\r\n64 The majority asserts that the \"plain language\" of section 1912(f) \"requires a\r\nshowing that the transferee parent's prospective legal and physical custody is likely\r\nto result in serious damage to the Indian child.\" (emphasis added). Section\r\n1912(f) says no such thing. The majority’s attempt to engraft into the statute the\r\nterms \"transferee\" and \"prospective\" must be rejected. The text of section 1912(f)\r\nrequires a showing that \"the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian\r\ncustodian\" would result in emotional harm to the child. (emphasis added).\r\n\nHere, Father chose not to be a parent for an extended period of time. In addition,\r\nthere is compelling evidence that Baby Girl would suffer serious emotional\r\ndamage if removed from the physical custody of Appellants. In this case, although\r\nthe record raises substantial questions as to Father's fitness as a parent, ICWA does\r\nnot require the presentation of additional evidence showing that a biological parent\r\ncould not provide a good home for the child. See In re Adoption of Baade, 462\r\nN.W.2d 485, 490-91 (1990) (reasoning that if parent retained legal custody of the\r\nchild, the adoptive couple would be unable to adopt him and would have no basis\r\nfor maintaining physical custody; as a result, the father's continued legal custody\r\nwould result in the child having to leave the adoptive couple, which would produce\r\nserious emotional damage). Thus, \"[w]hen the child is not in the custody of the\r\nparents for a protracted period of time, as in this case, it would be irrelevant to\r\nreceive testimony as to whether or not the continued custody of the child by the\r\nparents will harm the child.\" In re the Interest of D.S.P., 480 N.W.2d 234, 240-41\r\n(Wis. 1992). I would adopt this well-reasoned approach. Since Father has never\r\nmade meaningful attempts to establish a relationship with Baby Girl, the\r\ndistinction drawn by the family court is incongruous with the facts before us. I\r\ntherefore find the appropriate analysis of section 1912(f) requires only an\r\nexamination of the likelihood of serious emotional harm if the child were removed\r\nfrom Appellants, the sole caregivers Baby Girl has ever known.\r\n\r\nIn light of Dr. Saylor's testimony regarding the deep and nurturing bond formed\r\nbetween Appellants and Baby Girl, if Father were to retain continued legal\r\ncustody, thereby preventing Appellants from retaining physical custody of the\r\nchild, I am persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that Baby Girl would suffer\r\nsevere emotional harm. Thus, I conclude Appellants have satisfied the\r\nrequirements of section 1912(f).          b.\r\n\r\n                             Active Remedial Efforts\r\n\r\nIn addition to other protections afforded by ICWA, section 1912(d) requires that,\r\nbefore a parent's rights may be terminated, a court must determine if active efforts\r\nto provide remedial services have been made. Specifically, that section states:\r\n\r\n      Any party seeking to effect a . . . termination of parental rights to[] an\r\n      Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts\r\n      have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative\r\n\n      programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and\r\n      that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n25 U.S.C. § 1912(d). The remedial efforts should be directed at remedying the\r\nreason that led to removal. Adoption of Hannah S., 48 Cal. Rptr.3d 605, 612 (Cal.\r\nCt. App. 2006); see also Matter of Baby Boy Doe, 902 P.2d 477 (Idaho 1995)\r\n(holding that the types of remedial and rehabilitative services to be required under\r\nICWA depend on the facts of the case).\r\n\r\nThe legislative history of subsection (d) suggests that Congress intended for the\r\nFederal standard regarding active efforts to mirror state law standards after which\r\nit was patterned:\r\n\r\n      The committee is advised that most State laws require public or\r\n      private agencies involved in child placements to resort to remedial\r\n      measures prior to initiating placement or termination proceedings, but\r\n      that these services are rarely provided. This subsection imposes a\r\n      Federal requirement in that regard with respect to Indian children and\r\n      families.\r\n\r\nH.R. Rep. No. 1386, at 22 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7530, 7545.\r\nSee also Adoption of Hannah S., 48 Cal. Rptr.3d 605 (finding active efforts are\r\nessentially equivalent to reasonable efforts to provide reunification services under\r\nstate law); In re Baby Boy Doe, 902 P.2d 477 (accord). Like most states, South\r\nCarolina requires reasonable efforts to be made to reunify a family following the\r\nremoval of a child from a parent's custody. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1640\r\n(South Carolina's family preservation statute setting forth requirement that\r\n\"reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify a family\" have been made by Department\r\nof Social Services).\r\n\r\nInitially, it is clear Congress envisioned section 1912(d) to apply in the removal\r\ncontext. See Holyfield, 490 U.S. at 32 (noting the legislative history of ICWA\r\ndemonstrates Congress was concerned with \"the wholesale removal of Indian\r\nchildren from their homes, the most tragic aspect of Indian life today\" (emphasis\r\nadded) (internal quotations omitted)). Likewise, in terms of the state standards\r\nreferenced in the House Report, South Carolina's reasonable efforts requirement is\r\napplicable when a child has been removed from the parent's custody. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. §§ 63-7-1640 (noting child's health and safety are the paramount\r\nconcern with regard to state's reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify a family);\r\n63-7-2570(2) (establishing that parent must comply with terms of state plan and\r\n\nremedy the conditions which caused removal).65 To be clear, I do not find the\r\nabsence of a removal action in the traditional sense dispositive of the active efforts\r\nrequirement of section 1912(d); however, I merely acknowledge the reality that\r\nbecause the circumstances before us do not involve removal, the application of\r\nsection 1912(d) is not straightforward. See In re J.S., 177 P.3d 590 (Okla. Civ.\r\nApp. 2008) (finding the active efforts provision of section 1912(d) eludes\r\ndefinition and therefore should be determined by courts on a case-by-case basis).\r\nAs an additional difficulty, the parties seeking the termination of parental rights are\r\nAppellants, not the state. I acknowledge that the absence of the state social\r\nservices agency as a party to this proceeding does not render section 1912(d)\r\ninapplicable; however, as a practical hurdle, its resources cannot be utilized to\r\ncomply with the active efforts requirement. Overwhelmingly, most cases applying\r\nsection 1912(d) encompass issues relating to vocational rehabilitation, alcohol or\r\nsubstance abuse, mental health issues, lack of parenting skills, or domestic\r\nviolence allegations, all of which may be treated through counseling and education\r\nprovided through child protection agencies. See, e.g., In re K.B., 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d\r\n751 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009) (noting that county department of public social services\r\nsatisfied the active efforts requirement where department provided mother with\r\nreferrals to inpatient substance abuse program, parent class, homemaking\r\nassistance, and a class designed to educate parents on issues of sexual abuse); In re\r\nInterest of Walter W., 744 N.W.2d 55 (2008) (affirming finding that state\r\ndepartment's case manager assisted mother in locating and applying for inpatient\r\nchemical dependence programs, provided list of job skill development programs,\r\nreferred her for a mental health evaluation, assisted her in finding housing, and\r\nprovided bus tickets for transportation to Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics\r\nAnonymous, and visitations with her child).\r\n\r\nIn the case before us, termination of parental rights is sought on the basis of\r\nFather's willful abandonment of parental rights and responsibilities. Yet, Father\r\nclaims active efforts were not offered because he was not advised of his parental\r\nrights, Mother concealed her plan for adoption, no one ever demanded child\r\nsupport from him, and a child support proceeding was not initiated. I find\r\ndisingenuous Father's claimed lack of awareness of his parental rights—by his own\r\n\r\n65 Further connecting the provision of rehabilitative services to the removal\r\ncontext, such services may also be offered to parents proactively to prevent a\r\nchild's removal in the first instance. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1650 (permitting\r\nstate to provide services to abused and neglected children without the removal\r\nfrom custody).\r\n\nadmission he knew of Mother's pregnancy and was informed of Baby Girl's\r\nexpected due date. In fact, Father relies on his early acknowledgement of paternity\r\nin support of his claim as an ICWA parent pursuant to section 1903(9).\r\n\r\nI further find Father's expectation to be notified of Mother's adoption plan is\r\nunreasonable in light of his expressed desire (verbally and in writing) to \"give up\"\r\nhis parental rights and his prolonged failure to inquire about the child after her\r\nbirth. Moreover, Father undoubtedly knew of the adoption when he was served\r\nwith pleadings in this lawsuit in January 2010. Yet, other than his intervention in\r\nthe adoption proceeding, his conduct towards Baby Girl remained unchanged until\r\nFebruary 2011 when he first attempted to support the child.66\r\n\r\nFor purposes of invoking constitutional and statutory protections afforded an\r\nunwed father, a father's support for an expected child is an obligation that arises at\r\nthe instant the father learns of the pregnancy and continues after the child's birth. It\r\nis of no moment that a father is under no family court order requiring support\r\npayments. See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 547 S.E.2d\r\n506 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding formal notice of a parental duty to support is not\r\nrequired before failure to discharge such duty may serve as grounds for termination\r\nof parental rights); S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 258, 519\r\nS.E.2d. 351, 356 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"[N]othing in [63-7-2570] requires a parent be\r\n'notified' of his duty to support or visit [child] before failure to discharge those\r\nduties may serve as grounds for termination of parental rights.\"). This settled law\r\nstands in contrast to the family court's finding that Father's parental rights would\r\nnot be terminated under state law for failure to support because, in part, Appellants\r\nnever requested support from Father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66   This Court has previously stated:\r\n\r\n         Even in the most acrimonious of situations, a[n unwed] father-to-be\r\n         can fund a bank account in the mother-to-be's name. He can have\r\n         property or money delivered to the mother-to-be by a neutral third\r\n         party. He can—and must—be as creative as necessary in providing\r\n         material assistance to the mother-to-be during the pregnancy and, the\r\n         law thus assumes, to the child once it is born.\r\n\r\nReeves, 392 S.C. at 153, 708 S.E.2d at 783.\r\n\nFurther affecting the active efforts requirement is the basis for termination of\r\nFather's parental rights—his abandonment of Baby Girl. Father claims his\r\nabandonment was conditioned on his belief that Mother would raise the child—not\r\nplace her for adoption. Now Father contests Baby Girl's adoption and argues\r\ntermination of his parental rights is improper because active remedial efforts have\r\nnot been made to prevent the breakup of his family. I do not follow Father's logic.\r\nThe breakup of the Indian family does not turn on whether Baby Girl is raised by\r\nher mother or by Appellants—rather, the breakup of Father's Indian family was\r\noccasioned by Father's unwillingness to become involved in the child's life, a\r\ndecision he made long before he learned of the adoption proceedings. See In re\r\nN.B., 199 P.3d 16, 25 (2007) (\"The active efforts inquiry [of section 1912(d)]\r\nfocuses on reunifying the broken Indian family.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nA finding of abandonment necessarily encompasses \"conduct on the part of the\r\nparent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish\r\nall parental claims to the child.\" Hamby v. Hamby, 264 S.C. 614, 617, 216 S.E.2d\r\n536, 538 (1975). As the family court found in this case:\r\n\r\n      During [Mother's] pregnancy and after the child's birth, [Father] was a\r\n      full time member of our military, earning income. Though he had the\r\n      ability to do so, he never attempted to offer any type of meaningful\r\n      support to [Mother] or his child. In essence, prior to being served\r\n      with the adoption lawsuit when the child was four months old,\r\n      [Father] made no \"meaningful attempts\" to assume his responsibility\r\n      of parenthood . . . .67\r\n\r\nUnder the facts presented, I ask: what active efforts are envisioned under section\r\n1912(d) where, as here, the parent has consistently avoided parental rights and\r\nresponsibilities? In my judgment, it would defy common sense and ignore the\r\nreality of the facts of this case to construe Congressional intent to mandate a futile\r\nact. Because active efforts are aimed at remedying the conditions which threaten\r\nthe parent-child relationship, in my opinion, Father's unilateral abandonment\r\ncannot be corrected by remedial services or rehabilitative programs. See Adoption\r\nof Hannah S., 48 Cal. Rptr.3d at 612 (finding party seeking termination of parental\r\nrights was not required to make active efforts based on father's abandonment and\r\n\r\n67Despite this finding, the family court concluded Father did not willfully fail to\r\nsupport the child under state law.\r\n\nfelony convictions resulting in a prison term). Appellants cannot reasonably be\r\nexpected to provide such services to someone who has expressed, in both actions\r\nand words, an unwillingness to form a parent-child relationship. See In re Welfare\r\nD.K., No. A10-550, 2010 WL 4181454, at *2 (Minn. Ct. App. Oct. 26, 2010)\r\n(affirming family court's ruling that active efforts were made in part because father\r\nhad not visited child in over a year despite living near the child, missed a\r\nscheduled visit without explanation, and father's failure to visit was attributable to\r\nhis subjective feelings that visiting was inconvenient rather than to county's failure\r\nto provide assistance); In re Children of J.W.L., No. A05-20, 2005 WL 1804833, at\r\n*6 (Minn. Ct. App. Aug. 2, 2005) (holding social workers' efforts would have been\r\nfutile in part because father never had a relationship with children, initially denied\r\npaternity as to both, and had previously shown no interest in being a parent).68\r\n\r\nAny \"rehabilitation\" or attempt at curing Father's refusal to undertake the\r\nresponsibilities that come with being a parent was squarely and completely within\r\n\r\n68 In rejecting futility as an option under section 1912(d), the majority states that\r\nFather must receive rehabilitative services even if one assumes \"Father did not\r\nwant custody of Baby Girl and did not desire to act as a parent to her.\" What the\r\nmajority expresses as an assumption is in fact the reality of this case. Lost in the\r\nacademic discussion and rigid application of legal principles is a child whose birth\r\nfather abandoned her from the moment he learned of the pregnancy. The majority\r\nconstrues ICWA to require active remedial efforts to an Indian parent regardless of\r\nthe facts. I could not disagree more strongly, as I believe Congress intended\r\nsection 1912(d) to be construed through the lens of the facts of the particular case\r\nand the best interests of the Indian child. The majority's rigid approach to section\r\n1912(d) cannot be reconciled with an approach that seeks a result consistent with\r\nthe best interests of the Indian child. I am simply not persuaded that application of\r\nsection 1912(d) is meant to relieve a parent of a purposeful decision not to be a\r\nparent, which is a decision that is entirely unconnected to any need for\r\nrehabilitative services. Given Father's purposeful decision to abandon parental\r\nrights and responsibilities, I find absurd the Court's suggestion that Appellants\r\nshould have \"attempt[ed] to stimulate Father's desire to be a parent or to provide\r\nnecessary education regarding the role of a parent.\" I view this as requiring not\r\nmerely efforts to rehabilitate a nonexistent parent-child relationship, but rather to\r\nperform a miracle. The Court's suggestion illustrates the futility of providing\r\nrehabilitative services in this case. It is a tragic end that Appellants, whose\r\nconduct is implicitly characterized as unlawful, are now blamed for not\r\n\"stimulating\" Father to become a real parent.\r\n\nhis own control. See Reeves, 392 S.C. at 150, 708 S.E.2d at 728 (\"[I]t is only if [a\r\nfather] grasps that opportunity and accepts some measure of responsibility for the\r\nchild's future may he enjoy the blessings of the parent-child relationship and make\r\nuniquely valuable contributions to the child's development.\"); Abercrombie v.\r\nLaBoon, 290 S.C. 35, 348 S.E.2d 170 (1986) (finding curative conduct after\r\ninitiation of an action for termination of parental rights may be considered by the\r\ncourt, but only rarely would such judicially motivated repentance standing alone\r\nwarrant a finding that an abandonment was cured). Accordingly, in line with other\r\ncourts that have reached the same conclusion, I believe it is unnecessary to require\r\na showing of reunification efforts because such efforts would be futile under these\r\ncircumstances. See, e.g., In re N.B., 199 P.3d at 25 (\"The facts showing\r\nabandonment will vary widely from case to case, and determining futility in any\r\ngiven case would be a factual matter necessarily left to the trial court.\") (citing In\r\nre Baby Boy Doe, 902 P.2d at 484).\r\n\r\nAlthough I have previously examined Father's abandonment at length, I mention it\r\nagain only to point out that, at the time Baby Girl was placed with Appellants,\r\nthere was no indication Father had any interest in grasping his opportunity as a\r\nparent. To the contrary, every indication from Father was that he was totally\r\nuninterested regarding Baby Girl's future and well-being and that he wished to\r\n\"give up\" his parental rights. Further, in the Oklahoma action, Father's initial\r\ncomplaint indicated that neither he nor Baby Girl were Native American, and\r\nstated ICWA was inapplicable.69\r\n\r\nWhile I recognize ICWA's laudable policy of preserving and reunifying American\r\nIndian families where possible, I cannot accept that Congress intended to force\r\nsuperfluous attempts aimed at mending nonexistent parent-child relationships.\r\nCertainly, the Act \"does not do so at the expense of a child's right to security and\r\nstability.\" In re C.A.V., 787 N.W.2d 96, 104 (Iowa Ct. App. 2010). Application of\r\nsection 1912(d) is not meant to relieve a parent of a purposeful decision not to be a\r\nparent, which is a decision that is entirely unconnected to any need for\r\nrehabilitative services and unrelated to the unique familial and child-rearing culture\r\nof the Cherokee Nation. Accordingly, I conclude no efforts could have prevented\r\nthe breakup of this Indian family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69I fully appreciate that Father's complaint was later amended to allege ICWA's\r\napplicability.\r\n\nBased on the foregoing, I would terminate Father's parental rights with respect to\r\nBaby Girl in accordance with section 63-7-2570 of the South Carolina Code and\r\nsection 1912 of ICWA.                         D.\r\n\r\n                                     Adoptive Placement\r\n\r\nA termination of Father's parental rights does not end this matter. It must be\r\ndetermined if adoption of Baby Girl by Appellants is appropriate in light of\r\nICWA's adoption placement preferences. ICWA mandates that\r\n\r\n            In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a\r\n            preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the\r\n            contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the child's extended\r\n            family; (2) other members of the Indian child's tribe; or (3) other\r\n            Indian families.\r\n\r\n25 U.S.C. § 1915(a) (emphasis added). Congressional history indicates that\r\n\"[Subsections 1915(a) and (b)] establish a Federal policy that, where possible, an\r\nIndian child should remain in the Indian community, but is not to be read as\r\nprecluding the placement of an Indian child with a non-Indian family.\" H.R. Rep.\r\nNo. 1386, at 22 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7530, 7546 (emphasis\r\nadded). The emphasized language is, in my judgment, tied to the underlying\r\nCongressional intent to serve the best interests of the child.\r\n\r\nCherokee Nation contends Appellants' motion to finalize the adoption of Baby Girl\r\nshould be denied because they failed to establish good cause to deviate from the\r\nplacement preferences set forth in section 1915. According to the tribe, Appellants\r\nfailed to demonstrate any of the factors set forth in BIA Guidelines warranting\r\ndeviation from the preferences set forth in section 1915.70 At oral argument before\r\n\r\n70The BIA Guidelines offer examples of the kinds of factors that can provide good\r\ncause to deviate:\r\n\r\n     (i)\t      The request of the biological parents or the child when the child is of\r\n               sufficient age.\r\n\r\n     (ii)\t     The extraordinary physical or emotional needs of the child as established\r\n               by testimony of a qualified expert witness.\r\n\nthis Court, counsel for Cherokee Nation stated \"The [Appellants] would be the last\r\npeople available to adopt this child even if [Father] was out of the picture.\" That\r\nstatement is chilling, for it demonstrates the tribe's lack of concern for the best\r\ninterests of this unique child. I note that paternal grandparents are not parties to\r\nthis action, and although Cherokee Nation has intervened and expressed its\r\nrecommendation regarding adoptive placement of Baby Girl, that recommendation\r\nis not dispositive. See In re J.R.S., 690 P.2d 10, 17 (Alaska 1984) (\"ICWA entitles\r\nthe tribe to influence over adoptive placements, not to adoptive rights\r\nthemselves.\").\r\n\r\nI believe that the Indian child's best interests are of primary consideration in\r\nadoption proceedings, notwithstanding the tribe's preference to the contrary. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-20 (stating that in adoption proceedings \"when the interests\r\nof a child and an adult are in conflict, the conflict must be resolved in favor of the\r\nchild.\"); In re Appeal in Maricopa Cnty. Juvenile Action No. A-25525, 667 P.2d\r\n228, 234 (Az. Ct. App. 1983) (finding ICWA's declared policy emphasizes that the\r\nfirst interest Congress seeks to protect is that of Indian children); see also 25\r\nU.S.C. § 1902. \"[I]t is patently clear that Congress envisioned situations in which\r\nthe child's best interest may override a tribal or family interest . . . .\" Maricopa\r\nCnty., 667 P.2d 228, 234 (Az. Ct. App. 1983) (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 1915(a), (b)).\r\n\r\nFurther, the BIA Guidelines may assist the Court, but they are not binding, nor are\r\nthey an exhaustive list. See BIA Guidelines, 44 Fed. Reg. 67584, 67594 (1979)\r\n(\"[T]hese guidelines . . . are not published as regulations because they are not\r\nintended to have binding legislative effect.\"). Although ICWA and the BIA\r\nGuidelines draw attention to relevant considerations, the best interests of the child\r\nremain paramount.71 See Adoption of N.P.S., 868 P.2d 934 (Alaska 1994);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     (iii)\t The unavailability of suitable families for placement after a diligent\r\n            search has been completed for families meeting the preference criteria.\r\n\r\nBIA Guidelines, 44 Fed. Reg. 67584, 67594 (1979).\r\n71The majority finds that Appellants' showing of good cause must be ignored\r\nbecause Baby Girl was unlawfully removed from Oklahoma shortly after her birth\r\nand wrongfully placed with Appellants in South Carolina, such that any subsequent\r\nbonding cannot be relied upon to establish good cause. Further, the Court faults\r\nAppellants for failing to notify the tribe that Baby Girl was to be removed from\r\nOklahoma and cites to the Cherokee Nation's sovereign authority in determining\r\n\nMaricopa Cnty., 667 P.2d 228 (Az. App. 1983); In re Interest of Bird Head, 331\r\nN.W.2d 785 (Neb. 1981).\r\n\r\nI would hold that good cause exists to deviate from the adoptive placement\r\npreferences of section 1915(a). Baby Girl has resided with Appellants for two\r\nyears. A close parent-child relationship with each of the adoptive parents has been\r\nestablished, and her removal would cause severe emotional damage. See Maricopa\r\nCnty., 667 P.2d at 234 (affirming family court's finding of good cause where the\r\nchild had resided with the adoptive mother for three years, that a close mother-\r\nchild relationship had been established, and that the baby's removal would cause\r\npsychological damage). Additionally, Mother has consistently expressed her\r\ndesire that Baby Girl be placed with Appellants. ICWA expressly provides that\r\ncourts should consider the preference of a parent.72 See 25 U.S.C. § 1915(c)\r\n\r\n\r\nthe fate of its children.\r\n\r\nWhile I have previously expressed my frustration with the Court's misreading of\r\nHolyfield and resurrection of unappealed rulings, I am compelled to note that Baby\r\nGirl was removed from Oklahoma only after receiving a letter from Cherokee\r\nNation indicating that she would not be considered an Indian Child and that ICWA\r\nwas not applicable. Although Cherokee Nation cannot be penalized for receiving\r\nincomplete information in the intitial inquiry, it likewise cannot be rewarded for\r\nengaging in the most cursory of investigations into this child's heritage,\r\nnotwithstanding Mother's unequivocal assertions that Father was an enrolled\r\nmember of the Cherokee Nation. I construe the events following that initial\r\nresponse from Cherokee Nation as Appellants' good-faith reliance on the tribe's\r\nrepresentations that Baby Girl was not Cherokee and ICWA was not applicable.\r\nIgnoring the bonding that occurred here is simply ignoring the reality of this case.\r\n72 By way of supplemental citation, Father contends Mother's preference that Baby\r\nGirl be placed with Appellants is, standing alone, insufficient to constitute good\r\ncause warranting deviation from section 1915(a). See In re T.S.W., 276 P.3d 133\r\n(Kan. 2012) (holding placement preference of birth mother alone does not\r\nconstitute good cause to deviate from placement preferences under ICWA). I do\r\nnot disagree. Although I recognize that the placement preference of a birth mother\r\nstanding alone may be insufficient, here, Mother's preference, although certainly\r\nrelevant, is only one of several factors in my analysis. The totality of the\r\ncircumstances, in my judgment, compels a finding of good cause to deviate from\r\nthe section 1915 placement preferences.\r\n\n(\"Where appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or parent shall be\r\nconsidered . . .\"); see also In the Adoption of F.H., 851 P.2d 1361 (Alaska 1993)\r\n(holding mother's preference for placement with non-Indian, adoptive parents was\r\nappropriate factor in finding good cause). Moreover, Appellants have expressed\r\nand demonstrated a desire and willingness to introduce Baby Girl to her Indian\r\nculture.73 Section 1917 permits an adopted Indian child to receive information on\r\nhis or her \"tribal affiliation . . . and . . . such other information as may be necessary\r\nto protect any rights flowing from the individual's tribal relationship\" upon\r\nreaching the age of eighteen. 25 U.S.C. § 1917. Thus, I am persuaded that Baby\r\nGirl will have a knowledge of and appreciation for her cultural heritage. See In re\r\nRobert T., 246 Cal. Rptr. at 176 (holding that the Native American child's best\r\ninterests were to remain with his adoptive parents since they have bonded well and\r\nhave encouraged him to learn about and visit his cultural roots).\r\n\r\nIn light of the totality of the evidence, including the strong emotional parent-child\r\nbond formed between the Appellants and Baby Girl, the harm that would be caused\r\nif Baby Girl were removed from the only parents she has ever known, Mother's\r\nexpressed preference, and Appellants' dedication to exposing the child to her\r\nIndian heritage, I would hold good cause exists to deviate from the placement\r\npreferences of ICWA.                      IV.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI dissent and would reverse the judgment of the family court. I would terminate\r\nFather's parental rights pursuant to section 63-7-2570 of the South Carolina Code\r\nof Laws and in accordance with ICWA. Additionally, I would hold there is good\r\ncause to deviate from ICWA's adoptive placement preferences and remand for an\r\nimmediate entry of judgment approving and finalizing the adoption of Baby Girl\r\nby Appellants. And finally, I would require the immediate return of Baby Girl to\r\nAppellants.\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73I reject Cherokee Nation's contention that the interests of an Indian child are\r\nalways better served by placement with an Indian family.\r\n\nJUSTICE HEARN: Without hesitation, I join Justice Kittredge's thoughtful,\r\nwell-reasoned, and excellent dissent. Like Justice Kittredge, I view both the\r\npertinent facts of this case—facts which emanate solely from Father's conduct—\r\nand the legal principles underlying termination of parental rights and adoption as\r\nrequiring judgment in favor of Adoptive Couple. My review of the record\r\nconvinces me that Father turned his back on the joys and responsibilities of\r\nfatherhood at every turn. I would not minimize, as the majority does, the telling\r\nfact that Father told Mother in writing after Baby Girl's birth that he would\r\nrelinquish his parental rights rather than support her and Baby Girl, and I do not\r\njoin the majority in accepting his laughable explanation that he did this as a way to\r\nconvince Mother to marry him. In stark contrast to Father's behavior in completely\r\nshirking his parental responsibilities, every action taken by Adoptive Couple since\r\nthey learned she was going to be their child has demonstrated their deep and\r\nunconditional love and commitment to Baby Girl. Nevertheless, today, the\r\nmajority goes out of its way to re-cast the facts in a light unfavorable to Adoptive\r\nCouple and overlooks Father's clear course of conduct, affording him a second\r\nchance at fatherhood, all at great emotional cost to Baby Girl and Adoptive\r\nCouple.\r\n\r\nApart from the human tragedy that Father's reluctance to act like a father until the\r\neleventh hour has wrought on Baby Girl, Adoptive Couple, and their extended\r\nfamily, I profoundly disagree with the majority's elevation of the Indian Child\r\nWelfare Act (ICWA) to a position of total dominance over state law and settled\r\nprinciples of the best interests of the child, a position which I find totally\r\nunsupported by ICWA jurisprudence. As Justice Kittredge demonstrated, Father's\r\nlast-ditch efforts to embrace a relationship with his daughter under the cloud of\r\nlitigation are far too little and much too late. I cannot fathom that Congress\r\nintended ICWA to require the return of a child to a parent who consistently, by his\r\nwords and actions, evinced a desire to forego his responsibilities as a father. I\r\ntherefore wholeheartedly join Justice Kittredge's dissent and would order Baby\r\nGirl's return to Adoptive Couple.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
