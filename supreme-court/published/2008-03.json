Brandt, PA, of Walhalla, for respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent[1] and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the\r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any sanction in Rule\r\n  7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent\r\n  from the practice of law in this state.[2]Â \r\n  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nSince\r\n  the late 1980s, respondent represented Client and his wife on a variety of\r\n  legal matters.Â  Presently, Client is an elderly man residing in a retirement\r\n  community.Â  Clientâ€™s wife resided in the same facility until her death in\r\n  November 2002.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  drafted durable powers of attorney for Client and his wife.Â  In each of the\r\n  documents, respondent was named attorney-in-fact.Â  The durable powers of\r\n  attorney drafted by respondent contained a provision that respondent, as\r\n  attorney-in-fact, had authority to â€œdeal with Attorney in Attorneyâ€™s individual,\r\n  or any fiduciary capacity in buying and selling assets, and lending and\r\n  borrowing money, and in all other transactions irrespective of the occupancy by\r\n  the same person of dual positions.â€Â   \r\nRespondentâ€™s\r\n  representation of Client and his wife in the preparation and execution of the\r\n  durable powers of attorney and the naming of respondent as attorney-in-fact\r\n  presented a conflict of interest.Â  Respondent did not advise Client and his\r\n  wife of this conflict of interest.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  admits misappropriating more than $400,000 from Clientâ€™s personal assets for\r\n  his own use and benefit by executing documents, checks, etc., as Clientâ€™s\r\n  attorney-in-fact.Â  Further, respondent borrowed money from Client without\r\n  obtaining his informed consent to the conflict of interest the transactions\r\n  presented.Â  Respondent failed to reduce the terms of Clientâ€™s loans to\r\n  respondent to writing in the form and with the substance required by the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct.Â   \r\nClient\r\n  initiated a civil action against respondent.Â  Respondent settled the suit, in\r\n  part by agreeing to pay restitution.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  pled guilty to one count of exploitation of a vulnerable adult.Â  He was\r\n  sentenced to eighteen (18) months under house arrest.Â Â Â   \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his\r\n  misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.8(a) (lawyer shall not enter\r\n  into business transaction with a client unless terms are fair and disclosed,\r\n  client is given opportunity to seek advice of independent counsel, and client\r\n  consents in writing); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of client separate\r\n  from lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 8.4(b)\r\n    (lawyer shall not commit criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s\r\n    honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule\r\n    8.4(c) (lawyer shall not commit criminal act involving moral turpitude); Rule\r\n    8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit,\r\n    or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that\r\n    is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â Â  Â \r\nRespondent further admits his\r\n  misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(5) ( it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  engage in conduct tending to pollute administration of justice, bring courts or\r\n  legal profession into disrepute, or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to\r\n  practice law) and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this\r\n  state).Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender\r\n  his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent\r\n  was admitted to practice law in this State in 1978.Â  While he practiced law in\r\n  Clemson, South Carolina, for most of his career, respondent was practicing law\r\n  at 125 Bram Cat Alley in Seneca when he was placed on incapacity inactive\r\n  status on August 8, 2007.  \r\nÂ We are aware that there is another\r\n  attorney with a very similar name who has practiced law in Seneca for his\r\n  entire career, James L. Williams.Â  This attorney practices law at 107 North\r\n  Fairplay in Seneca, and he has no involvement in this matter and is a member in\r\n  good standing with the South Carolina Bar.\r\n[2] While the agreement was pending before the\r\n  Court, respondent submitted a letter requesting permission to resign from the\r\n  Bar.Â  The request is denied.Â  Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26446","title":"State v.

Â The James also asserted\r\n  a separate cause of action against Kelly Trucking for the negligent hiring,\r\n  training, and supervision of Hymes based on his poor driving record.Â  In their\r\n  prayer for relief, the James sought both actual and punitive damages.\r\nThe\r\n  James settled with the insurers of both Hymes and Kelly Trucking, and then\r\n  sought recovery under the underinsured motorists provision (UIM) of their\r\n  insurance policy.Â  The Jamesâ€™ insurer (â€œthe Insurerâ€) then assumed the defense\r\n  of this case as allowed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (Supp. 2006).Â  The Insurer,\r\n  defending the action from the defendantsâ€™ perspective, stipulated that Hymes\r\n  was negligent in causing the accident and that Hymes was acting in the course\r\n  and scope of his employment with Kelly Trucking when the accident occurred.Â  The\r\n  Insurer then moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that the James were\r\n  precluded from proceeding with their negligent hiring claim because Kelly\r\n  Trucking had admitted liability for Hymesâ€™ negligence.Â   \r\nIt\r\n  was against this backdrop that the District Court certified two questions to\r\n  this Court, questions which we accepted pursuant to Rule 228, SCACR.Â  The\r\n  District Court asked:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDoes South Carolina law prohibit \r\n\t\t\ta plaintiff from pursuing a negligent hiring, training, supervision, \r\n\t\t\tor entrustment claim once respondeat superior liability has been admitted?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;If the answer to question 1 \r\n\t\t\tis in the affirmative, does South Carolina law recognize an \r\n\t\t\texception to the rule where punitive damages on the negligent \r\n\t\t\thiring, training, supervision, or entrustment claim are pled and \r\n\t\t\tavailable?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nA plaintiff in a\r\n  civil case may have a number of causes of action at his disposal through which\r\n  he may seek to hold a tortfeasor or other responsible party liable for his\r\n  injury, and this is no less the case when a plaintiff alleges that he has been\r\n  injured by an employee acting in the course and scope of his employment.Â  The\r\n  doctrine of respondeat superior provides that the employer, as the employeeâ€™s\r\n  master, is called to answer for the tortious acts of his servant, the employee,\r\n  when those acts occur in the course and scope of the employeeâ€™s employment.Â  Sams\r\n    v. Arthur, 135 S.C. 123, 128-131, 133 S.E. 205, 207-08 (1926).Â  Such\r\n  liability is not predicated on the negligence of the employer, but upon the\r\n  acts of the employee, whether those acts occurred while the employee was going\r\n  about the employerâ€™s business, and the agency principles that characterize the\r\n  employer-employee relationship.Â  Id.\r\nJust as an employee\r\n  can act to cause anotherâ€™s injury in a tortious manner, so can an employer be\r\n  independently liable in tort.Â  In circumstances where an employer knew or\r\n  should have known that its employment of a specific person created an undue\r\n  risk of harm to the public, a plaintiff may claim that the employer was itself\r\n  negligent in hiring, supervising, or training the employee, or that the employer\r\n  acted negligently in entrusting its employee with a tool that created an\r\n  unreasonable risk of harm to the public.Â  See Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 317 (1965) (Cited with\r\n    approval in Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114, 116, 420 S.E.2d\r\n  495, 496 (1992)).Â  As this recitation suggests, the employerâ€™s liability under\r\n  such a theory does not rest on the negligence of another, but on the employerâ€™s\r\n  own negligence.Â  Stated differently, the employerâ€™s liability under this theory\r\n  is not derivative, it is direct.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nThe Insurer\r\n  argues that pubic policy justifies the preclusion of the pursuit of a negligent\r\n  hiring, training, supervision, or entrustment claim against an employer when the\r\n  employer admits vicarious liability.Â  The argument goes that the admission of evidence\r\n  which must be offered to prove a negligent hiring, training, supervision, or\r\n  entrustment claim - evidence such as a prior driving record, an arrest record,\r\n  or other records of past mishaps or misbehavior by the employee - will be highly\r\n  prejudicial if combined with a stipulation by the employer that it will\r\n  ultimately be vicariously liable for the employeeâ€™s negligent acts.Â  The Insurer\r\n  argues that allowing a plaintiff to maintain an independent negligence cause of\r\n  action against the employer will require that evidence of an employeeâ€™s past\r\n  negligence be admitted.Â  This admission, in the Insurerâ€™s view, will result in\r\n  the jury improperly inferring that because the employee was negligent in the\r\n  past, he was negligent in causing the plaintiffâ€™s injuries.Â  The Insurer argues\r\n  that this inference will lead to a jury verdict driven more by emotion than by\r\n  application of the law. Â Although we do not take these arguments lightly, we\r\n  believe that they do not accurately characterize the concerns at play.Â   \r\nPrimarily,\r\n  we think the argument that an independent cause of action against an employer\r\n  must be precluded to protect the jury from considering prejudicial evidence\r\n  presumes too much.Â  Our court system relies on the trial court to determine when\r\n  relevant evidence is inadmissible because its probative value is substantially\r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\r\n  misleading the jury.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Similarly, we rely on the trial\r\n  court to craft instructions describing what a jury may or may not infer from a\r\n  particular piece of evidence, and we grant the trial court discretion to give such\r\n  instructions to the jury at the time such evidence is introduced, when charging\r\n  the jury at the close of the case, or at any proper time in between.Â  In our\r\n  view, the argument that the court must entirely preclude a cause of action to protect\r\n  the jury from considering prejudicial evidence gives impermissibly short-shrift\r\n  to the trial courtâ€™s ability to judge the admission of evidence and to protect\r\n  the integrity of trial, and to the juryâ€™s ability to follow the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  instructions.  \r\nIf\r\n  this fact alone did not provide a sufficient basis to reject the proposition at\r\n  issue, the additional complexities involved with adopting such a rule and the\r\n  proposed exception would provide the tiebreaker.Â  To its credit, the Insurer\r\n  stipulates that if a plaintiff should generally be prohibited from pursuing a\r\n  negligent hiring, training, supervision, or entrustment claim once respondeat superior\r\n  liability has been admitted, there should be an exception to this rule where an\r\n  employerâ€™s conduct is so reckless or wanton that punitive damages are available.Â \r\n  Although this exception appears fairly benign on the surface, we think it\r\n  raises procedural problems of its own.[2]Â  \r\n \r\nWhen\r\n  judging whether a plaintiff may proceed to trial on a cause of action, the\r\n  trial court typically concerns itself only with whether the plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  complaint states a factual basis to support a cause of action and whether, at\r\n  the close of his presentation of the case, the plaintiff has presented a prima\r\n  facie case supporting the allegations of his complaint.Â  If the trial court,\r\n  under the exception proposed, is asked to make any sort of a qualitative\r\n  judgment regarding the employerâ€™s conduct, the exception would drastically alter\r\n  our traditional concepts of the courtâ€™s proper function.Â  On the other hand, if\r\n  the trial court is simply required to ask whether the plaintiff has requested\r\n  an award of punitive damages, we think the adoption of a rule of preclusion might\r\n  prove of little utility.Â  As requests for punitive damages are commonplace in\r\n  cases of this type, we think traveling the road the Insurer proposes would\r\n  create an exception which swallows the rule.Â  Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  recognize that other jurisdictions have answered these questions differently, see,\r\n    e.g., McHaffie v. Bunch, 891 S.W.2d 822, 826 (Mo. 1995, but we are not\r\n  resolved to agree in this instance.Â  In our view, it is a rather strange\r\n  proposition that a stipulation as to one cause of action could somehow\r\n  â€œprohibitâ€ completely the pursuit of another.Â  A plaintiff may, in a single\r\n  lawsuit, assert many causes of action against a defendant.Â  The considerations\r\n  limiting a plaintiffâ€™s available causes of action in the typical case are that\r\n  the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate a prime facie case for each cause of\r\n  action and that a plaintiff may ultimately recover only once for an injury.Â  Thus,\r\n  although the Insurerâ€™s stipulation as to vicarious liability ensures that the Insurer\r\n  (standing in the shoes of Kelly Trucking) will be liable for the Jamesâ€™ injuries,\r\n  that is only the practical effect of the stipulation.Â  Such practical\r\n  considerations, in our opinion, ought not require the preclusion of a claim\r\n  based upon Kelly Truckingâ€™s alleged negligence in hiring Hymes as a matter of\r\n  law.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nAfter\r\n  considering the arguments in favor of answering the first certified question in\r\n  the affirmative, we are of the opinion that the largely policy-based arguments\r\n  offered in support of such an answer do not justify a grant of approval to the\r\n  rule proposed.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that South Carolina law does not\r\n  prohibit a plaintiff from pursuing a negligent hiring, training, supervision,\r\n  or entrustment claim once respondeat superior liability has been admitted, and\r\n  we therefore answer the first certified question â€œno.â€Â  For this reason, we\r\n  need not reach the second question certified by the District Court.  \r\nPLEICONES and\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur. MOORE, J. dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\n  WALLER, J. concurs. \r\nJUSTICE\r\n  MOORE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I\r\n  would hold that a plaintiff may proceed on a negligent hiring claim when the\r\n  employer admits vicarious liability only if there is evidence of gross\r\n  negligence in hiring that would support an award of punitive damages.\r\nAs a\r\n  general rule, most jurisdictions do not allow a separate claim against an\r\n  employer where vicarious liability is admitted for the acts of an employee.Â  See McHaffie v. Bunch, 891 S.W.2d 822, 826 (Mo. 1995), and cases cited\r\n    therein; Annot. 30 A.L.R. 4th 838 (1984).[3]Â \r\n  The rationale is that the employerâ€™s liability is a derivative claim fixed by a\r\n  determination of the employeeâ€™s negligence.Â  Some courts following this general\r\n  rule, however, will allow a negligent hiring claim to proceed when the\r\n  employerâ€™s liability is alleged to include gross negligence in hiring;\r\n  in this situation, the employerâ€™s gross negligence supports a claim beyond the\r\n  employeeâ€™s negligent act.Â  See Durben v. American Materials, Inc.,\r\n  503 S.E.2d 618 (Ga. 1998);Â  Lockett v. Bi-State Transit Auth., 445\r\n  N.E.2d 310 (Ill. 1983); Coville v. Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., 795\r\n  N.Y.S.2d 708 (2006); see also Bruck v. Jim Walter Corp., 470\r\n  So.2d 1141 (Ala. 1985).Â  Finally, a minority of courts will allow a negligent\r\n  hiring claim to proceed, irrespective of gross negligence on the employerâ€™s\r\n  part, because they hold that negligent hiring is a separate, and not\r\n  derivative, claim.Â  See Quinonex v. Andersen, 696 P.2d 1342 (Ariz. 1984); Marquis v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 961 P.2d 1213 (Kan. 1998); Lim v. Interstate System Steel Div., Inc., 435 N.W.2d 830 (Minn. 1989).Â  The majority has chosen to follow the minority rule.\r\nContrary to the\r\n  minority view, our precedent indicates that generally a claim against an\r\n  employer under a theory of respondeat superior is treated as a derivative claim\r\n  dependent upon establishing the negligence of the employee.Â  For instance, in David\r\n    v. McLeod Reg. Med. Center, 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2006), a\r\n  plaintiff alleged medical malpractice by the treating physicians and vicarious\r\n  liability of the hospital.Â  We held summary judgment was properly granted in\r\n  favor of the hospital because the plaintiff had failed to establish negligence\r\n  by the physician-employees.Â  Similarly, in McCullem v. Liberty Life Ins. Co.,\r\n  217 S.C. 565, 571, 61 S.E.2d 181, 184 (1950), we upheld a nonsuit in the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s action against an employer for injuries allegedly caused by an\r\n  employee where there was no evidence of the employeeâ€™s negligence.Â  Both these\r\n  cases indicate that generally an employerâ€™s liability is determined by the\r\n  negligence of his employee and the suit against the employer is a derivative\r\n  one.[4]Â   \r\nIn\r\n  some circumstances, a plaintiff may allege the employerâ€™s negligence rises to\r\n  such a level that it supports liability in addition to the employerâ€™s\r\n  vicarious liability for the employeeâ€™s negligent acts.[5]Â \r\n  I would allow a separate cause of action in this circumstance because the cause\r\n  of action against the employer is no longer simply derivative of, or dependent\r\n  upon, the negligence of the employee.[6]Â \r\n  Allowing such an action against an employer would further the deterrent purpose\r\n  of punitive damages.Â  See Clark v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Pub.\r\n    Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 608 S.E.2d 573 (2005) (upholding verdict on claim of\r\n  negligent supervision where there was evidence of employerâ€™s gross negligence\r\n  despite juryâ€™s failure to find employeeâ€™s breach of a duty); Clark v.\r\n    Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (purposes of\r\n  punitive damages are to punish wrongdoer and deter similar reckless, willful,\r\n  wanton, or malicious conduct in the future).[7]Â \r\n  I depart from the majorityâ€™s holding because I would not allow a separate cause\r\n  of action to proceed where there is no evidence of gross negligence on the\r\n  employerâ€™s part.Â   \r\nWALLER,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] Some jurisdictions have limited the application of the theories of negligent\r\n  hiring, training, supervision, and entrustment to instances where an employee\r\n  acts outside the scope of his employment, and this proposition finds some\r\n  support in the comments to the Restatement.Â  See Di Cosala v. Kay, 450\r\n  A.2d 508, 515 (N.J. 1982); and Restatement\r\n  (Second) Â§ 317 cmt. a.Â  Our case law has not previously recognized such\r\n  a distinction, and the parties in this case did not argue that we should begin\r\n  to do so.Â Â Â   \r\n[2] The Insurer focuses much of its argument on the question of whether an award of\r\n  punitive damages against it, standing in the shoes of the defendants, would be\r\n  constitutional.Â  Though an intriguing question, this was not a question we\r\n  agreed to answer.\r\n[3]Judge\r\n  Anderson, who certified the questions here, applied this majority rule in\r\n  another South Carolina case but acknowledged that this Court has never ruled on\r\n  the issue.Â  Bowman v. Norfolk So. Rwy., 832 F.Supp. 1014, 1021-22\r\n  (D.S.C. 1993).  \r\n[4]Similarly,\r\n  in Longshore v. Saber Security Servs., Inc., 365 S.C. 554, 619 S.E.2d 5\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005), the Court of Appeals speculated that a plaintiff must prove an\r\n  actionable tort by the employee in order to maintain a negligent hiring action\r\n  against the employer.Â   \r\n[5]Defendants do not argue against adopting such a rule.Â \r\n  Instead, they simply claim that any punitive damages award in this case is\r\n  unconstitutional.Â  This is not a question we agreed to answer in accepting the\r\n  questions certified by the District Court.\r\n[6]For\r\n  instance, here plaintiffs claim Hymesâ€™ poor driving record supports punitive\r\n  damages against Kelly Trucking irrespective of any showing that Hymes himself\r\n  was grossly negligent.Â   \r\n[7]I\r\n  note that by giving a limiting instruction, the trial court may restrict the\r\n  use of evidence regarding the negligent hiring claim to avoid the potential danger\r\n  of unfair prejudice from the juryâ€™s consideration of such evidence in the\r\n  context of the underlying tort.Â  For instance, here the jury could be\r\n  instructed that Hymesâ€™ poor driving record is not to be considered in\r\n  determining liability for the wreck but is admissible only on the negligent\r\n  hiring claim.Â  See Lockett, supra.Â   \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26448","title":"Hazel v.

Spencer, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tCharles Preston Edwards, of Spartanburg, for\r\n  respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  MOORE:Â  After respondentâ€™s request for a declaratory judgment was granted,\r\n  the State appealed.Â  We certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  pled guilty to kidnapping in 1979 and was sentenced to life imprisonment.[1]Â \r\n  He served twenty-two years of his sentence and was granted parole in 2002.Â \r\n  Upon release, he was informed that he would be required to register on the Sex\r\n  Offender Registry.Â  Respondent has registered annually since that time.[2]\r\nRespondent was\r\n  required to register pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430 (2007), which\r\n  provides that persons convicted of certain offenses\r\n  must register as sex offenders upon their release.Â  The current Â§ 23-3-430(C)(15) (2007) requires that any person convicted\r\n  of kidnapping a person eighteen years of age or older must register as a sex\r\n  offender unless a finding is made on the record that the kidnapping did not\r\n  include a criminal sexual offense or attempted criminal sexual offense.\r\nRespondent filed a\r\n  petition for declaratory judgment requesting that he not be required to\r\n  register as a sex offender.Â  The petition was originally regarded as a PCR\r\n  application; however, it was subsequently removed from the PCR docket and\r\n  placed on the Common Pleas non-jury docket.Â  Respondentâ€™s and the Stateâ€™s\r\n  motions for summary judgment were denied.\r\nA bench trial was\r\n  held and an order was issued finding that the transcript of the plea made it\r\n  clear there was no sexual element involved in the kidnapping.Â  The court found the\r\n  trial judge did not make a specific finding that sex was not involved in the\r\n  kidnapping because the law that required him to do so was not yet in effect.Â \r\n  The court further found that the legislative intent behind the 1998 amendment\r\n  to Â§ 23-3-430 was to protect the public from sexual offenders who may re-offend\r\n  and the court found this was certainly not the case with respondent.Â  The court\r\n  granted respondentâ€™s motion for declaratory judgment and found that respondent\r\n  is not required to register as a sex offender.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Common Pleas err \r\n\t\t\tby finding that respondentâ€™s 1979 kidnapping conviction did not \r\n\t\t\tinvolve a sexual offense such that he would be required to register \r\n\t\t\tas a sex offender?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Common Pleas \r\n\t\t\tlack subject matter jurisdiction to make a factual finding that \r\n\t\t\trespondentâ€™s kidnapping conviction did not involve a sexual offense?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nThe\r\n  State argues respondent became a sex offender upon the enactment of the 1994\r\n  amendment to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430, and that the court erred by applying\r\n  the 1998 amendment to him.\r\nSection 23-3-430\r\n  has been through many changes since its enactment in 1994.Â  In the beginning,\r\n  the statute provided that a person convicted of kidnapping shall be referred to\r\n  as a sex offender.Â  Â§ 23-3-430(8) (Supp. 1995).Â  The statute was amended in\r\n  1996 and kidnapping was deleted from the listing of offenses that require one\r\n  to register as a sex offender.Â  Â§ 23-3-430(C) (Supp. 1996).Â  In 1998, the\r\n  statute was again amended and kidnapping was re-added as one of the enumerated\r\n  offenses.Â  An exception was added to state that if the court makes a finding on\r\n  the record that the offense did not include a criminal sexual offense, then a\r\n  defendant convicted of kidnapping would not be required to register as a sex\r\n  offender.Â  Â§ 23-3-430(C)(15) (Supp. 1998).\r\nThe statute was\r\n  again amended in 1999.Â  This amendment rewrote the kidnapping subsection to\r\n  state that a person convicted of kidnapping a person eighteen years of age or\r\n  older would be required to register as a sex offender.Â  The exception was again\r\n  included and stated that no registration would be required if the court made a\r\n  finding on the record that the offense did not include a criminal sexual\r\n  offense or an attempted criminal sexual offense.Â  Â§ 23-3-430(C)(15) (Supp.\r\n  1999).[3]\r\nThe 1994 version of\r\n  the statute does not apply to respondent.Â  We conclude the applicable statute\r\n  is the statute that existed at the time of respondentâ€™s release from prison.[4]Â \r\n  Section 23-3-430 had no effect on respondent until he was released from prison\r\n  and was required to register as a sex offender.Â  Applying the law as it read on\r\n  the date of respondentâ€™s release best fulfills the legislatureâ€™s intent because\r\n  respondent is not at risk of re-offending where his crime did not have involve\r\n  a sexual element.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-400 (2007) states:\r\n\r\n\tThe intent of this article is to promote the stateâ€™s fundamental\r\n  right to provide for the public health, welfare, and safety of its citizens. .\r\n  . .\r\n\tThe sex\r\n  offender registry will provide law enforcement with the tools needed in investigating criminal offenses.Â \r\n  Statistics show that sex offenders often pose a high risk of re-offending.Â \r\n  Additionally, law enforcementâ€™s efforts to protect communities, conduct\r\n  investigations, and apprehend offenders who commit sex offenses are impaired by\r\n  the lack of information about these convicted offenders who\r\n  live within the law enforcement agencyâ€™s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nSee also State v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26, 558 S.E.2d 524\r\n  (2002) (the language of Â§ 23-3-400 makes clear that the legislature did not\r\n  intend to punish sex offenders, but instead intended to protect the public from\r\n  those sex offenders who may re-offend and to aid law enforcement in solving sex\r\n  crimes).\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  1999 version of Â§ 23-3-430(C)(15) applies to respondent because he was released\r\n  and required to register in 2002.[5]Â \r\n  The 1999 amendment states that a person convicted of kidnapping a person\r\n  eighteen years of age or older would be required to register as a sex offender,\r\n  with the exception that no registration would be required if the court made a\r\n  finding on the record that the offense did not include a criminal sexual\r\n  offense or an attempted criminal sexual offense.Â  In the instant case, no such\r\n  finding was made on the record because the amendment did not exist at that\r\n  time.Â  The record is clear, however, that no sexual misconduct was involved in\r\n  this kidnapping.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Common Pleas properly found that\r\n  respondent should not be required to register as a sex offender.\r\nII\r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the Court of Common Pleas did not have jurisdiction to make a\r\n  factual finding regarding respondentâ€™s kidnapping offense and, instead, such a\r\n  finding could be made only by the General Sessions court.\r\nThe Court of Common\r\n  Pleas had the power to make this finding pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment\r\n  Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann Â§ 15-53-20 (2005) (courts of record within their\r\n  respective jurisdictions shall have power to declare rights, status, and other\r\n  legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed).Â  The\r\n  judge, in the Court of Common Pleas, properly determined respondentâ€™s status as\r\n  affected by Â§ 23-3-430, a civil statute.Â  See State v. Walls, supra (Sex Offender Registry Act not so punitive in purpose or effect as to\r\n  constitute a criminal penalty).Â  As a result, we approve the procedure utilized\r\n  by the Court of Common Pleas and find that court has the power to make the\r\n  determination that a prior kidnapping offense did not involve sexual misconduct\r\n  such that the one convicted is required to register as a sex offender.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the decision of the lower court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.&nbsp;\r\n[1]Respondent,\r\n  his former wife, and another man kidnapped a woman and demanded $20,000 from\r\n  her husband.Â  No sexual misconduct was involved in the kidnapping.  \r\n[2]However,\r\n  after the lower courtâ€™s ruling, respondent was removed from the Sex Offender\r\n  Registry.\r\n[3]Three subsequent amendments did not affect this\r\n  subsection.Â  Â§ 23-3-430(C)(15) (2007).  \r\n[4]Further, the kidnapping subsection of the 1994 statute\r\n  was implicitly repealed by the 1996 amendment that removed kidnapping as one of\r\n  the enumerated offenses requiring one to register as a sex offender.Â  See Taylor v. Murphy, 293 S.C. 316, 360 S.E.2d 314 (1987) (repeal of a\r\n  statute operates retrospectively and has the effect of blotting the statute out\r\n  completely as if it had never existed).\r\n[5]The\r\n  lower court incorrectly applied the 1998 amendment; however, using the 1998\r\n  amendment, instead of the 1999 amendment, does not affect the result in this\r\n  case.  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26449","title":"James v.

California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).\r\nRespondent filed an\r\n  application for PCR, contending that he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and\r\n  intelligently enter a guilty plea.Â  After a hearing, the PCR court granted\r\n  relief.Â  The PCR court held, â€œ[u]pon examination of the entire record, it is\r\n  apparent that [Respondent] never entered a guilty plea.Â  He was never asked how\r\n  he pled and never made any statement that could be construed as an admission of\r\n  guilt.â€Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the PCR courtâ€™s decision, and the State presents the following issue for\r\n  review:\r\nDid the\r\n  PCR court err in finding that Respondent never entered a guilty plea?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives\r\n  great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings and conclusions.Â  Caprood v.\r\n    State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray\r\n      v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995)).Â  A PCR courtâ€™s findings\r\n  will be upheld on review if there is any evidence of probative value supporting\r\n  them.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â \r\n  In the context of a challenge to a guilty plea, a PCR applicant must establish\r\n  both that his plea counselâ€™s representation was deficient and that there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that but for counselâ€™s deficient representation, the\r\n  applicant would not have pled guilty.Â  Smith v. State, 369 S.C. 135,\r\n  137, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006) (citing Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-58 (1985)).\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the PCR court erred in finding that Respondent never entered\r\n  a guilty plea.Â  We agree.\r\nThere\r\n  are two fatal flaws in the PCR courtâ€™s order.Â  The first relates to the courtâ€™s\r\n  conclusion that Respondent never made any statement that could be construed as\r\n  an admission of guilt.Â  As a primary matter, it is well-settled that a\r\n  defendant need not admit guilt in order to enter a valid guilty plea.Â  North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31 (1970).Â  Instead, a guilty plea\r\n  need only represent a voluntary and intelligent choice among alternative\r\n  courses of action open to the defendant.Â  Id.Â  For this reason, the\r\n  implication that an admission of guilt is a necessary prerequisite to a guilty\r\n  plea does not accurately characterize the law.\r\nBut\r\n  this point is not determinative, because even if a guilty plea required an\r\n  admission of guilt, Respondent admitted his guilt at the plea hearing.Â  The\r\n  solicitor at the hearing recounted the factual basis for the charges at length,\r\n  and when the court asked Respondent if he had anything to offer, he responded,\r\n  â€œThis time it just got out of control that night, and I wasnâ€™t going to kill\r\n  her, I know I wasnâ€™t going to - it just got out of control, it got out of\r\n  hand[,] and Iâ€™m sorry.â€Â  In light of this statement, the PCR courtâ€™s conclusion\r\n  that Respondent did not admit his guilt at the plea hearing is directly\r\n  contrary to the evidence in the record.\r\nThe\r\n  second flaw in the PCR courtâ€™s order is in its attachment of unnecessary\r\n  significance to the fact that the plea court never specifically asked\r\n  Respondent â€œhow do you plea?â€Â  The argument goes that the plea courtâ€™s failure\r\n  to ask this question is tantamount to a failure by Respondent to enter a plea.Â \r\n  In our opinion, however, this failure is not fatal to the pleaâ€™s validity.\r\nRespondent\r\n  incorrectly focuses only on the fact that the plea court did not specifically\r\n  ask for his plea.Â  The transcript of the plea hearing cannot be viewed in\r\n  isolation, but must be considered in the full context of the record.Â  Harres\r\n    v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 133, 318 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1984); State v.\r\n      Lambert, 266 S.C. 574, 579, 225 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1976).Â  This\r\n  context requires that we consider both the transcript and Respondentâ€™s conduct\r\n  relating to the execution of the written plea sheet.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  plea sheet is instructive because it contains a written manifestation of\r\n  Respondentâ€™s desire to plead guilty and was executed by Respondent immediately\r\n  prior to the plea hearing.Â  Respondent submitted the sheet to the court during\r\n  the plea hearing, and the court examined Respondent regarding the information\r\n  provided in the plea sheet during the hearing.Â  Respondent indicated to the\r\n  plea court that his attorney reviewed the plea sheet with him and that his answers\r\n  were true and correct.Â  This indication, that the answers provided in the plea\r\n  sheet were correct, is the most instructive.Â  This presumably applies to\r\n  Respondentâ€™s affirmative response to the final question on the sheet which\r\n  reads â€œAre you pleading guilty freely and voluntarily?â€Â  The plea sheet and Respondentâ€™s\r\n  conduct at the plea hearing thus unequivocally expressed his desire to plead\r\n  guilty.[2]\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that the PCR court erred in determining that Respondent did not enter a\r\n  guilty plea.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s grant of relief.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1] Specifically, the State charged Respondent with assault and battery with intent\r\n  to kill, first degree criminal sexual conduct, and first-degree burglary.Â  \r\n \r\n[2] Similarly, the plea courtâ€™s imposition of a sentence clearly evidences that the\r\n  court accepted Respondentâ€™s plea.Â  Cf. Gaines v. State, 335 S.C. 376,\r\n  381, 517 S.E.2d 439, 441-42 (1999) (providing that â€œ[t]he clear implication is\r\n  that the trial judge found the pleas voluntary[,] otherwise he would not have\r\n  entered [the] sentences.â€).\r\n(footnote\r\n  continues)\r\nInterestingly, the record in the instant\r\n  case also contains three â€œsentencing sheetsâ€ - documents executed by both\r\n  Respondent and the plea court containing the caption of Respondentâ€™s case, a\r\n  criminal charge, an indication that Respondent has pled guilty to the listed\r\n  charge, and a sentence for the listed charge.Â  This evidence further undercuts\r\n  the proposition that Respondent never pled guilty.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26451","title":"Duvall v.

Duvall, Jr., challenged the\r\n  calculation of his retirement benefits by respondent, the South Carolina\r\n  Retirement System (â€œSCRSâ€).Â  The Administrative Law Court (â€œALCâ€) upheld the\r\n  calculation made by the SCRS, and the circuit court affirmed the ALCâ€™s\r\n  decision.Â  Duvall now directly appeals to this Court.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDuvall has been the executive director of the Municipal\r\n  Association of South Carolina (â€œMASCâ€) since 1992 and has been employed there\r\n  since 1987.Â  Although Duvall is not a state employee, he is an active member in\r\n  the SCRS because the MASC is a participating employer with the SCRS.[1]\r\nBefore\r\n  2003, the MASC permitted its employees to accrue unlimited amounts of unused\r\n  annual leave.Â  In October 2002, the MASCâ€™s board of directors changed this\r\n  policy and decided to cap unused leave at 45 days (360 hours).Â  Of the MASCâ€™s\r\n  35-member staff, only four people had unused leave in excess of 45 days, and\r\n  Duvall was one of those four.Â  The MASC board decided that all employees who\r\n  had accumulated leave in excess of 360 hours as of December 31, 2002, would be\r\n  allowed to either use the leave, or be paid the excess annual leave â€œas an\r\n  addition to salaryâ€ prior to leaving the employment of the MASC.Â   \r\nDuvall\r\n  opted to be paid for his excess leave.Â  In the first quarter of 2003, he\r\n  received approximately $18,000 for unused excess annual leave; in the second\r\n  quarter of 2003, he was paid approximately $39,000.Â  The payouts for Duvallâ€™s\r\n  excess leave of 734.8 hours came to a total of $57,997.76.[2]\r\nDuvall decided to retire under the Teacher\r\n  and Employee Retention Incentive (TERI) plan, with an effective retirement date\r\n  of October 1, 2003.[3]Â \r\n  At the time of his TERI retirement, Duvallâ€™s regular annual salary was\r\n  approximately $147,000.Â  Furthermore, because he still had 45 days of unused\r\n  annual leave at retirement, he received a lump sum payment of $27,637.20 at\r\n  retirement.Â  When the SCRS calculated Duvallâ€™s average final compensation, this\r\n  latter amount was included in the calculation; however, the payments he\r\n  received earlier in 2003 for excess unused annual leave (amounting to over\r\n  $57,000) were excluded from the calculation of his retirement benefits.Â \r\n \r\nThe estimates done by the\r\n  SCRS projected that if all payments were considered, Duvall would have a\r\n  monthly retirement benefit of $9,224.13; with the excess leave payments excluded,\r\n  the monthly benefit would be $8,053.99.Â  Thus, if the excess leave payments are\r\n  considered this would amount to over $14,000 more in benefits per year.[4]Â   \r\nDuvall challenged the calculation, arguing\r\n  that the $57,997.76 in\r\n  unused annual leave was intended by the MASC to be part of his salary, and\r\n  therefore, he was entitled to have it included for purposes of calculating his\r\n  average final compensation.Â  The SCRS issued a Final Agency Determination which\r\n  found that the system was prohibited by statute from including any payments for\r\n  unused annual leave above the 45-day limit.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  9-1-10(4).\r\nDuvall filed for review with the ALC.Â  After\r\n  a hearing, the ALC upheld the agencyâ€™s decision.Â  Duvall then appealed to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  In addition to arguing that the ALC should be reversed on the\r\n  merits, Duvall also argued that because of a subsequent statutory amendment,\r\n  the case should be remanded back to the ALC.Â  The circuit court affirmed the\r\n  ALCâ€™s ruling.Â  Specifically, the circuit court found that leave payments which\r\n  either exceed 45 days or are made at any time other than â€œat retirementâ€ should\r\n  not be included in the average final compensation calculation.  \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the circuit court err in\r\n  affirming the exclusion of excess unused leave payments from the calculation of\r\n  Duvallâ€™s retirement benefits?Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDuvall argues the circuit\r\n  court erred by finding that SCRS properly excluded the excess annual leave\r\n  payments he received in the first two quarters of 2003 from its calculation of\r\n  his retirement benefits.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis\r\n  Court has stated that the retirement statutes â€œshould be liberally construed in\r\n  favor of those to be benefitted and the objective sought to be accomplished.â€ Â King\r\n    v. South Carolina Ret. Sys., 319 S.C. 373, 461 S.E.2d 822 (1995).Â \r\n  Nevertheless, the SCRS is also â€œadministered under an elaborate statutory and\r\n  constitutional scheme designed to protect the independence, integrity and\r\n  actuarial soundness of the funds.â€Â  Wehle v. South Carolina Ret. Sys.,\r\n  363 S.C. 394, 399, 611 S.E.2d 240, 242&nbsp;(2005).Â   \r\nâ€œAverage final compensationâ€\r\n  is currently defined by statute as:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  average annual earnable compensation[5] of a member during the twelve consecutive quarters of his creditable service on\r\n  which regular contributions as a member were made to the system producing the\r\n  highest such average; a quarter means a period January through March, April\r\n  through June, July through September, or October through December.Â  An\r\n    amount up to and including forty-five daysâ€™ termination pay for unused annual\r\n    leave at retirement may be added to the average final compensation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-10(4)\r\n  (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the Legislature.Â  E.g., Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79,\r\n  85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581&nbsp;(2000).Â  When construing statutory language, the\r\n  statute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of the same\r\n  general statutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.Â  TNS\r\n    Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 620, 503\r\n  S.E.2d 471, 476 (1998).Â  Moreover, â€œ[a] statute should not be construed by\r\n  concentrating on an isolated phrase.â€Â  South Carolina State Ports Auth. v. Jasper County, 368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629&nbsp;(2006).Â  The Court must\r\n  presume the Legislature intended its statutes to accomplish something and did\r\n  not intend a futile act.Â  TNS Mills, supra.\r\nCiting\r\n  the liberal construction rule of King, supra, Duvall contends\r\n  that because the average final compensation definition only speaks to â€œtermination\r\n  pay for unused annual leave at retirement,â€ those payments made prior to retirement should be included as salary.[6]Â \r\n  Specifically, Duvall maintains that the Legislature included the phrases â€œtermination\r\n  payâ€ and â€œat retirementâ€ because it intended to refer only to unused leave\r\n  payments made at the actual end of a system memberâ€™s employment.Â  According to\r\n  Duvall, any other interpretation of the statute would ignore those words and\r\n  therefore render the Legislatureâ€™s action as futile.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  addition, Duvall asserts that because he is not a state employee, he is not\r\n  restricted to 45 days of annual leave upon retirement; state employees, on the\r\n  other hand, are statutorily limited to a 45-day cap.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 8-11-620 (â€œUpon termination from state employment, an employee may take both\r\n  annual leave and a lump-sum payment for unused leave, but this combination may\r\n  not exceed forty-five days in a calendar yearâ€).\r\nWe\r\n  find Duvallâ€™s arguments unpersuasive.Â  The statutory language defining average\r\n  final compensation clearly indicates that a maximum of 45 daysâ€™ pay for unused\r\n  annual leave should be used to calculate the average final compensation.Â  Thus,\r\n  even if additional payments for annual leave are made at a time other than â€œat\r\n  retirement,â€ those payments should not be included.Â  In our opinion, the\r\n  Legislatureâ€™s inclusion of the terms â€œtermination payâ€ and â€œat retirementâ€ was\r\n  not futile; instead, when these terms are read in context with the entire\r\n  definition of average final compensation, the language clearly establishes the\r\n  intent to cap how much unused annual leave may be figured into the retirement\r\n  calculation. Â See Hodges v. Rainey, supra (the primary\r\n  rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\n  Legislature); see also South Carolina State Ports Auth. v. Jasper County, supra (a statute should not be construed by focusing on an\r\n  isolated phrase).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  this Courtâ€™s discussion of average final compensation in Kennedy v. South\r\n    Carolina Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 549 S.E.2d 243 (2001), supports the\r\n  decision made by the SCRS.[7]Â \r\n  At issue in Kennedy was whether the 45 days of unused annual leave pay\r\n  should be added into the equation before or after the total average had been\r\n  calculated.Â  The Kennedy Court looked to the legislative history, as\r\n  well as the rules of statutory construction, and concluded the intent was that\r\n  annual leave pay should be added prior to the average being computed.\r\nThe Kennedy Court noted that when the Legislature amended this definition in 1978, it â€œaddressed\r\n  unused annual leave for the first time.â€Â  Id. at 344, 549 S.E.2d at\r\n  245.Â  The 1978 amendment added the following emphasized language, and the\r\n  definition then stated as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\tâ€œAverage final compensationâ€ with respect to those members\r\n  retiring on or after July 1, 1970, shall mean the average annual earnable\r\n  compensation of a member during the three consecutive fiscal years of his\r\n  creditable service producing the highest such average; an amount up to and including forty-five days\r\n    termination pay for unused annual leave may be added to the pay period\r\n    immediately prior to retirement and included in the average as applicable. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nPrior\r\n  to 1978, however, there was no language specifically addressing unused annual\r\n  leave.Â  As a matter of policy, the SCRS had credited retirees with all of their accrued unused leave and used that credit when calculating the average\r\n  final compensation.Â  Moreover, there was no limit on the amount of annual leave\r\n  that an employee could accumulate.Â  See id. at 343, 549 S.E.2d at\r\n  245.\r\nAccording to the Kennedy Court, the 1978\r\n  amendment therefore had two primary effects regarding annual leave:\r\n\r\n\tFirst, the amendment placed a\r\n  forty-five day cap on the amount of unused annual leave for which an employee\r\n  could receive credit. Â Second, the unused annual leave could only be calculated\r\n  in the average final compensation equation if the pay period immediately prior\r\n  to the employeeâ€™s retirement was one of the three highest in the employeeâ€™s\r\n  career. Â As a consequence of this second restriction, employees would regularly\r\n  have to retire on the last day of their last fiscal year to ensure that any\r\n  unused annual leave would be included in the calculation.Â  Servicing a large\r\n  volume of retirement claims at one time created an administrative problem for\r\n  the Retirement System.\r\n\r\nId.Â   \r\nAs a\r\n  result of this administrative glitch, the Legislature amended the definition\r\n  again in 1986 by using language regarding â€œtwelve consecutive quartersâ€ as\r\n  opposed to â€œthree consecutive fiscal years.â€Â  Thus,\r\n  the 1986 amendment allowed members of the SCRS â€œto retire throughout the\r\n  year, rather than require essentially all retirements to occur on June 30, the\r\n  last day of the fiscal year.â€ Â Wehle, 363 S.C. at 400, 611 S.E.2dÂ  at\r\n  243.\r\nThe Kennedy Courtâ€™s conclusion was that average final compensation was properly\r\n  calculated by totaling the 12 highest consecutive quarters, adding the termination\r\n  payment for up to 45 days of unused annual leave, and then taking the\r\n  average.Â  The Court reasoned that if the statute was interpreted as allowing\r\n  the annual leave payment to be added in after an average was taken,\r\n  â€œthis interpretation would increase the dollar value for unused annual leave\r\n  three fold, and would allow members\r\n  to retire with benefits calculated on an â€˜averageâ€™ salary which is greater than\r\n  any salary they earned during employment.â€Â  Kennedy, 345 S.C. at 348,\r\n  549 S.E.2d at 248 (footnote omitted).\r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, Duvallâ€™s position is that he is entitled to calculate his average final\r\n  compensation by adding: (1) his pre-retirement payments for over 90 days of excess unused leave ($57,997.76);\r\n  (2) his regular salary for the 12 quarters prior to retirement; and (3) his\r\n  final payment at retirement for 45 days of unused annual leave ($27,637.20);\r\n  and then dividing that sum by three.Â  Clearly, this would inflate the average\r\n  of his final three years of salary to an amount significantly â€œgreater than any\r\n  salaryâ€ he earned during one regular year of employment.Â  Pursuant to Kennedy,\r\n  this would be an absurd result unintended by the Legislature.Â  See id. at 351, 549 S.E.2d at 249 (statutes should not be construed as to lead to\r\n  absurd results).\r\nPut\r\n  another way, Duvall is asking that he be credited with three times the amount\r\n  of unused annual leave that state employees are permitted.Â  We simply do not\r\n  believe the Legislature intended such a result, especially because the language\r\n  of section 9-1-10(4) defines the average final compensation to be for those\r\n  â€œmembers retiring.â€Â  We therefore find that the 45-day cap for unused annual\r\n  leave is intended for all members of the SCRS, not simply those classified as\r\n  state employees. Â Cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-290 (1986) (the Budget and\r\n  Control Board shall, â€œfrom time to time, in its discretion, adopt rules and\r\n  regulations to prevent injustices and inequalities which might otherwise arise\r\n  in the administration of the System.â€).\r\nFinally,\r\n  Duvall contends that an amendment to section 9-1-1020, which expressly supports\r\n  the practice used by the SCRS in this case, was a material change to the\r\n  statute, thereby indicating that his interpretation of the statute (in its\r\n  prior form) is correct.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen\r\n  the Legislature adopts an amendment to a statute, this Court recognizes a\r\n  presumption that the Legislature intended to change the existing law.Â  Key\r\n    Corp. Capital, Inc. v. County of Beaufort, 373 S.C. 55, 60, 644 S.E.2d 675,\r\n  678&nbsp;(2007).Â  Nonetheless, a subsequent statutory amendment may also be\r\n  interpreted as clarifying original legislative intent.Â  Stuckey v. State\r\n    Budget and Control Bd.,&nbsp;339 S.C. 397, 401, 529 S.E.2d 706,\r\n  708&nbsp;(2000) (citing Cotty v. Yartzeff, 309\r\n  S.C. 259, 422 S.E.2d 100 (1992)).\r\nAt\r\n  the time the SCRS made its decision in this case, section 9-1-1020 read as\r\n  follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tPayments\r\n  for unused sick leave, single special payments at retirement, bonus and\r\n  incentive-type payments, or any other payments not considered a part of the\r\n  regular salary base are not compensation for which contributions are\r\n  deductible. Contributions are deductible on pay for unused annual leave.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, the Legislature amended this section, with an effective\r\n  date of July 1, 2004.Â  See 2005 Act No. 14, Â§ 3 (the Act).Â  The statute\r\n  now provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tPayments\r\n  for unused sick leave, single special payments at retirement, bonus and\r\n  incentive-type payments, or any other payments not considered a part of the\r\n  regular salary base are not compensation for which contributions are\r\n  deductible. Â Contributions are deductible on up to and including forty-five\r\n    daysâ€™ termination pay for unused annual leave. Â If a member has received\r\n      termination pay for unused annual leave on more than one occasion,\r\n      contributions are deductible on up to and including forty-five daysâ€™ termination\r\n      pay for unused annual leave for each termination payment for unused annual\r\n      leave received by the member.Â  However, only an amount up to and including\r\n      forty-five daysâ€™ pay for unused annual leave from the memberâ€™s last termination\r\n      payment shall be included in a members average final compensation calculation.\r\n\r\n(Additions to statute emphasized).Â \r\n  The title of the Act specifically stated that the amendment of section 9-1-1020\r\n  â€œrelat[ed] to member contributions for purposes of the South Carolina Retirement\r\n  System â€¦, so as to clarify the contribution requirements on unused annual\r\n    leave and the use of such payments in calculating average final compensation.â€Â \r\n  (Emphasis added.)\r\nGiven that the\r\n  title of the Act itself indicates the amendment was a clarification of, rather\r\n  than a change to, the law, we find a remand to the ALC is unnecessary.Â  See, e.g., Kennedy, 345 S.C. at 349, 549 S.E.2d at 248 (where the\r\n  Court looked at the title of an Act to glean legislative intent); Demas v. Convention Motor Inns, 268 S.C. 186, 190, 232 S.E.2d 724, 726&nbsp;(1977)\r\n  (noting that it is proper to discern legislative intent from the title of an Act).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above\r\n  discussion, we hold that the circuit court and the ALC correctly decided the\r\n  SCRS appropriately excluded payments made to Duvall for excess unused annual\r\n  leave from the calculation of his retirement benefits.Â  Thus, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-470 (Supp. 2007).\r\n[2] Originally, the SCRS\r\n  subtracted contributions to the retirement system from these payments.Â \r\n  However, those contributions were subsequently refunded to Duvall.\r\n[3] Duvall had 36 years of service credit within the\r\n  SCRS.Â  Pursuant to the TERI program, Duvall remains director of MASC until\r\n  September 30, 2008.Â  For these five years, the SCRS retains his monthly\r\n  retirement benefits in an interest-free account.\r\n[4] This does not take into account cost of living\r\n  increases.\r\n[5] â€œEarnable compensationâ€ is defined as â€œthe full rate\r\n  of the compensation that would be payable to a member if the member worked the\r\n  memberâ€™s full normal working time; when compensation includes maintenance,\r\n  fees, and other things of value the board shall fix the value of that part of\r\n  the compensation not paid in money directly by the employer.â€Â  Â§ 9-1-10(8).\r\n[6] To support his argument that the payments for excess\r\n  leave should be considered part of his salary, Duvall relies on Bales v.\r\n    Aughtry, 302 S.C. 262, 395 S.E.2d 177 (1990).Â  In Bales, the Court\r\n  stated that â€œ[l]eave benefits are part of compensation earned for services\r\n  rendered and the right to receive that compensation vests once the services are\r\n  rendered.â€Â  Id. at 264, 395 S.E.2d at 179.Â  The issue in Bales,\r\n  however, was not how leave payments related to retirement calculations;\r\n  instead, it was whether elected county officials were entitled to payment of accumulated sick and annual leave.Â  The Court held that\r\n  â€œ[p]ayment for accrued leave benefits\r\n  does not constitute extra compensation after services rendered.â€Â  Id.Â  Here, there is no dispute that Duvall was indeed paid for his accrued leave\r\n  benefits.Â  The issue is whether those payments should be figured into the\r\n  average final compensation computation.Â  Thus, we find Bales inapposite\r\n  to the instant case.\r\n[7] When Kennedy was heard, the statutory section\r\n  defining average final compensation was Â§ 9-1-10(17), but it is now located at Â§\r\n  9-1-10(4).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26452","title":"Austin v.

Â Appellant moved for a continuance\r\n  in order to conduct additional discovery.Â  The trial court granted summary\r\n  judgment for the Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â   \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the trial court err in granting summary judgment? \r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant urges this Court to adopt the tort of third party\r\n  spoliation of evidence and allow the case to further proceed through the\r\n  discovery phase. Specifically, she argues we should recognize the spoliation\r\n  tort as outlined by West Virginia in Hannah\r\n    v. Heeter, 584 S.E.2d 560 (W.Va. 2003).Â  Under the facts of this case, we\r\n  decline to do so.\r\nThis\r\n  Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion under the same\r\n  standard as the trial court, pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP:Â  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. E.g., Burriss v. Anderson County Bd. of Educ., 369 S.C. 443, 633 S.E.2d 482 (2006); Dawkins v. Fields,\r\n  354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003).Â  The\r\n  purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not\r\n  require the services of a fact finder.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C.\r\n  440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001).Â   \r\nIn Hannah,\r\n  the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia recognized two â€œstand-alone\r\n  tortsâ€ regarding spoliation of evidence:Â  (1) negligent spoliation of\r\n  evidence by a third party; and (2) intentional spoliation of evidence by\r\n  either a party to the civil action or a third party.[3]\r\nRegarding negligent\r\n  spoliation by a third party, the Hannah court held that the tort had the\r\n  following elements:\r\n\r\n\t(1) the\r\n  existence of a pending or potential civil action; \r\n\t(2) the\r\n  alleged spoliator had actual knowledge of the pending or potential civil action; \r\n\t(3) a\r\n  duty to preserve evidence arising from a contract, agreement, statute,\r\n  administrative rule, voluntary assumption of duty, or other special\r\n  circumstances; \r\n\t(4)\r\n  spoliation of the evidence; \r\n\t(5) the\r\n  spoliated evidence was vital to a partyâ€™s ability to prevail in a pending or\r\n  potential civil action; and \r\n\t(6)\r\n  damages. \r\n\r\nHannah, 584 S.E.2d at 569-70.\r\nAs for the tort of intentional spoliation of evidence, the Hannah court listed similar elements:\r\n\r\n\t(1) a\r\n  pending or potential civil action;\r\n\t(2)\r\n  knowledge of the spoliator of the pending or potential civil action; \r\n\t\r\n\t(3)\r\n  willful destruction of evidence; \r\n\t(4) the\r\n  spoliated evidence was vital to a partyâ€™s ability to prevail in the pending or\r\n  potential civil action; \r\n\t(5) the\r\n  intent of the spoliator to defeat a partyâ€™s ability to prevail in the pending\r\n  or potential civil action; \r\n\t(6) the\r\n  partyâ€™s inability to prevail in the civil action; and \r\n\t(7)\r\n  damages. \r\n\r\nHannah, 584 S.E.2d at 573.Â   \r\nUnder the\r\n  particular facts of the instant case, it is clear that appellantâ€™s allegations\r\n  do not rise to the level of stating a claim.Â  First, although appellant\r\n  contends there is a potential wrongful death action, no tortfeasor has been\r\n  identified, beyond the â€œunknown assailantsâ€ mentioned in the complaint.Â \r\n  Therefore, it is merely speculative that a potential civil action for wrongful\r\n  death exists.Â  Second, it obviously follows that the Sheriffâ€™s Office, could\r\n  not have actually known of the potentiality of a lawsuit, especially given the\r\n  fact that the Sheriffâ€™s Office apparently concluded that Bairâ€™s drug overdose\r\n  had been self-inflicted.Â  Certainly, appellant never notified the Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Office of the fact that she sought to pursue a civil lawsuit related to her\r\n  sonâ€™s death.\r\nThird, appellant\r\n  can point to no specific duty that the Sheriffâ€™s Office was required to\r\n  preserve this evidence.Â  We have held in a criminal case that the State has no\r\n  absolute duty to preserve potentially useful evidence that might exonerate a\r\n  defendant. Â See State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 538-39, 552 S.E.2d\r\n  300,&nbsp;307 (2001).Â  Clearly, then, under the facts of the instant case, there\r\n  was no general duty to preserve evidence after the police had terminated a\r\n  criminal investigation.\r\nFinally, because of\r\n  the speculative nature regarding the value of the evidence destroyed, appellant\r\n  is simply unable to establish that the destroyed evidence was vital to her\r\n  ability to prevail in the potential civil action.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  even using the tort elements set out by the Hannah court as urged by appellant,\r\n  no claim for third party spoliation of evidence has been alleged.Â  Thus, we\r\n  decline to address whether we would, under other factual circumstances, adopt\r\n  the tort of third party spoliation of evidence.Â  The grant of summary judgment\r\n  in favor of the Sheriffâ€™s Office is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This material was believed to be marijuana.\r\n[2] Appellant has not alleged the Sheriffâ€™s Office is\r\n  responsible for Bairâ€™s death.\r\n[3] The court refused to recognize first party negligent\r\n  spoliation of evidence.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26453","title":"Grosshuesch v.

Â \r\nThis\r\n  appeal represents the third time this Court has addressed issues arising out of\r\n  this litigation.Â  As their first step in defending the lawsuit, the Cramers\r\n  requested that the trial court stay the suit pending the resolution of the\r\n  criminal actions filed against them relating to these conveyances.Â  The trial\r\n  court denied this request, and we dismissed the Cramersâ€™ appeal from the denial\r\n  of the stay on the grounds that the trial courtâ€™s order was interlocutory, not\r\n  affecting the merits, and thus, not immediately appealable.\r\nNext,\r\n  this Court addressed the trial courtâ€™s denial of the Breedlovesâ€™ request for a\r\n  preliminary injunction.Â  The Breedloves sought to prevent the Cramers and\r\n  others acting on the Cramersâ€™ behalf from transferring or otherwise disposing\r\n  of the assets at issue.Â  In so seeking, the Breedloves filed lis pendens\r\n  against the subject real estate and sought a preliminary injunction preventing\r\n  the Cramers from exercising control over some of the accounts and assets in\r\n  dispute.Â  In seeking the injunction, the specific focus of the Breedlovesâ€™\r\n  concern was a Merrill Lynch account which they alleged initially contained $2\r\n  million, but has been almost completely depleted.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  Breedlovesâ€™ request for an injunction, and this Court reversed.Â  Grosshuesch\r\n    v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 623 S.E.2d 833 (2005).\r\nThe\r\n  consolidated appeals now at issue deal with several orders related to\r\n  discovery.Â  Over the course of this litigation, the Breedloves sought extensive\r\n  discovery relating to the amount of assets the Cramers received from the\r\n  Breedloves, expenses the Cramers appeared to authorize on behalf of the\r\n  Breedloves, and the present location of all assets acquired from the\r\n  Breedloves.Â  When the Breedloves received no response to their discovery\r\n  requests, they sought and were granted an order compelling Lisa Cramer to\r\n  respond to discovery.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  Cramers again entered no substantive response to the vast amount of Breedlovesâ€™\r\n  discovery, answering only that any response to discovery would be deemed a\r\n  waiver of rights secured by the Fifth Amendment to the United States\r\n  Constitution and by Article I, Section 12 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â \r\n  After receiving what were in their view insufficient responses to their\r\n  discovery requests, the Breedloves sought an order of contempt and sanctions as\r\n  to Lisa Cramer.Â  The trial court ordered Lisa Cramer to fully respond to\r\n  discovery and held her in contempt, but imposed no sanctions.Â  In this order,\r\n  the trial court additionally prohibited the Breedloves from disseminating any\r\n  information acquired in discovery to anyone not directly connected with this\r\n  litigation.Â  The purpose of this protective order, in the trial courtâ€™s view,\r\n  was to guard the integrity of the case and to prevent any criminal harm to the\r\n  Cramers from their discovery responses.Â  Lisa Cramer appealed from her finding\r\n  of contempt, and the Breedloves cross-appealed the imposition of the protective\r\n  order.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the Cramersâ€™ depositions followed this contempt order, the Breedlovesâ€™ quest\r\n  for information fared no better.Â  Ultimately, the trial court entertained a\r\n  second motion for contempt and sanctions arising out of Lisa Cramerâ€™s\r\n  essentially blanket refusal to answer questions in her deposition. Â The trial\r\n  court denied this request for contempt and sanctions, and the Breedloves\r\n  appealed.\r\nRoughly\r\n  around the same time they served their initial discovery requests, the\r\n  Breedloves issued subpoenas duces tecum to the Cramersâ€™ attorneys.Â  The\r\n  subpoenas requested that the attorneys produce documents evidencing any fees\r\n  they had received from the Cramers, withdrawals from the $2 million Merrill\r\n  Lynch account, and transfers of cash to the Cramers from the Breedloves.Â  The\r\n  trial court denied the attorneysâ€™ requests to quash the subpoenas and\r\n  ultimately held the attorneys in contempt.Â  Both attorneys appealed.\r\nAs a\r\n  result of the partiesâ€™ prolific appealing at each stage of litigation, the court\r\n  of appeals had several appeals related to this litigation pending by early 2007.Â \r\n  Specifically, the court of appeals had the appeal and cross-appeal relating to\r\n  the order holding Lisa Cramer in contempt for her initial discovery responses;\r\n  the Breedlovesâ€™ appeal of the order declining to hold Lisa Cramer in contempt\r\n  for her deposition conduct; and the Cramersâ€™ attorneysâ€™ appeals from their\r\n  contempt orders.Â  This Court issued an order certifying and consolidating all\r\n  of the pending appeals, and the parties present the following issues for\r\n  review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in holding\r\n  Lisa Cramer in contempt for failing to respond to discovery? (Lisa Cramerâ€™s\r\n  appeal)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tfinding the Cramersâ€™ attorneys in contempt for failing to comply with the subpoenas\r\n  duces tecum? (The attorneysâ€™ appeals)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tissuing a protective order prohibiting the Breedloves from disseminating any\r\n  information or discovery responses to anyone not directly connected with this\r\n  litigation? (the Breedlovesâ€™ cross-appeal)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in denying\r\n  the Breedlovesâ€™ second request for contempt and sanctions as to Lisa Cramer?\r\n  (the Breedlovesâ€™ appeal)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Order of Contempt\r\nLisa\r\n  Cramer argues that the trial court erred in holding her in contempt for failing\r\n  to respond to discovery.Â  We agree.\r\nBoth\r\n  the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 12\r\n  of the South Carolina Constitution declare that no person shall be compelled to\r\n  be a witness against himself in any criminal case.Â  In interpreting the Fifth\r\n  Amendment, the privilege against self-incrimination has been explained in\r\n  practical terms as an assurance that an individual will not be compelled to\r\n  produce evidence or information which may be used against him in a later\r\n  criminal proceeding. Â Maness v. Meyers, 419 U.S. 449, 461 (1975).Â  The\r\n  settled law provides that the privilege extends not only to answers that would\r\n  themselves support a criminal conviction, but also to answers furnishing a link\r\n  in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute an individual.Â  Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951).\r\nThat\r\n  a party has invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, however, does not\r\n  end the matter.Â  Instead, it is well-settled that an invocation of the\r\n  privilege is confined to instances where a person has reasonable cause to\r\n  apprehend danger from his answer.Â  Id.Â  Indeed:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  witness is not exonerated from answering merely because he declares that in\r\n  doing so he [will] incriminate himself - his say-so does not of itself\r\n  establish the hazard of incrimination.Â  It is for the court to say whether his\r\n  silence is justified . . . and to require him to answer if â€œit clearly appears\r\n  to the court that he is mistaken.â€\r\n\r\nId. (citing Temple v. Commonwealth, 1880, 75 Va. 892, 899); see also First Union Natâ€™l Bank v.\r\n  First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of S.C., 346 S.C. 462, 467, 551 S.E.2d\r\n  301, 303 (Ct. App. 2001).Â   \r\nThe Fourth Circuit\r\n  has instructed that a court judging the invocation of the privilege against\r\n  self-incrimination asks first whether the information is incriminating in\r\n  nature, and second, whether there is a sufficient possibility of criminal\r\n  prosecution to trigger the privilege.Â  United States v. Sharp,\r\n  920 F.2d 1167, 1170-71 (4th Cir. 1990).Â  In determining whether the information\r\n  is incriminating, the Sharp court recognized that at least two\r\n  categories of potentially incriminating questions exist.Â  First, there are\r\n  questions whose incriminating nature is evident on the questionâ€™s face in light\r\n  of the question asked and the surrounding circumstances.Â  Id. at 1170.Â \r\n  Second, there are questions which though not overtly incriminating, can be\r\n  shown to be incriminating through further contextual proof.Â  Id.Â  It is\r\n  with these principles in mind that we turn to an analysis of the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  order holding Lisa Cramer in contempt.[2]Â \r\n  Â \r\nWhen\r\n  comparing this analytical rubric to the trial courtâ€™s order of contempt, it is\r\n  clear that the order does not apply the correct standard when examining Lisa\r\n  Cramerâ€™s invocation of the constitutional privilege.Â  The trial court opined\r\n  that the privilege against self-incrimination was completely inapplicable in\r\n  the instant case for two reasons.Â  First, the trial court noted that the\r\n  Cramers have maintained that the transfers from the Breedloves were gifts.Â \r\n  Second, the trial court emphasized that the Cramers have unequivocally stated\r\n  that they intend on testifying at their criminal trial.Â  The Breedloves rely\r\n  heavily on these justifications in their argument before this Court, but although\r\n  these facts are extremely odd, they are irrelevant to constitutional privilege\r\n  analysis.\r\nDealing\r\n  first with the fact that the Cramers have maintained that the transfers from\r\n  the Breedloves were gifts, the question when judging the application of the\r\n  privilege against self-incrimination does not revolve around what defenses a\r\n  party has asserted in a civil action, but whether there is a reasonable\r\n  possibility that requiring a party to answer a certain question would provide information\r\n  that could be used against the party in a criminal proceeding or would lead to\r\n  the discovery of such information.Â  Hoffman, 341 U.S. at 486-87; Sharp, 920 F.2d at 1170. Â The Cramers are entitled to assert that they did\r\n  not engage in any criminal conduct over the course of their relationship with\r\n  the Breedloves, and this entitlement applies with equal force in both this\r\n  action and the pending criminal action.Â  Just as they would not lose the\r\n  protections against self-incrimination by entering a criminal plea of not-guilty,\r\n  so too does their assertion in this action that these transactions were\r\n  arms-length have no impact on the analysis of whether the Cramers have a\r\n  reasonable fear that their answers provided in discovery might be used against\r\n  them in a criminal proceeding.Â  Â Â \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s speculation about whether the Cramers would testify at their\r\n  criminal trial suffers from a similarly fatal flaw.Â  We are aware of no\r\n  authority providing that a party waives the application of the privilege\r\n  against self-incrimination by stating that they ultimately intend to testify at\r\n  trial.Â  Courts employ a high bar when judging the waiver of constitutional\r\n  rights.Â  See Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970) (noting\r\n  that â€œ[w]aivers of constitutional rights not only\r\n  must be voluntary but must be knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient\r\n  awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.â€).Â  In\r\n  this vein, we think that a pronouncement that one intends to waive a\r\n  constitutional right in the future does not amount to a waiver of that right.Â \r\n  Indeed, it stands to reason that if one says he intends to waive a right in the\r\n  future, he is invoking that right in the present.[3]Â   \r\nWhat\r\n  then were the circumstances available for the trial court to consider in making\r\n  its decision in this case?Â  The record reflects that the trial court possessed\r\n  the following information:Â  (1) that the Breedloves sued the Cramers seeking to\r\n  set aside several transfers of assets; (2) that the Breedloves are seeking\r\n  discovery as to a great deal of information, some of which deals directly with\r\n  their relationship to the Cramers and their transfers of assets to the Cramers;\r\n  and (3) that the Cramers have been involved in a criminal proceeding which\r\n  relates to their receipt of assets from the Breedloves since before the\r\n  inception of this civil action.Â  Given this information, the second step of the\r\n  privilege analysis is the easy assessment.Â  It is clear that a criminal prosecution\r\n  of the Cramers is not an event which might occur sometime in the future - it is\r\n  a present reality.\r\nThe\r\n  more difficult question, in our opinion, is the examination of the nature of\r\n  the questions asked in this case.Â  It is arguable, we think, that any discovery\r\n  directed at transfers of assets from the Breedloves to the Cramers might be incriminating\r\n  on its face.Â  It would seem that such discovery directly seeks the information\r\n  and transactions which are at the heart of the pending criminal proceeding\r\n  involving the Cramers. Â Accordingly, it would appear probable that the Cramers\r\n  could have a reasonable fear that their answers to questions focused on this\r\n  information would ultimately be used against them in the pending criminal\r\n  proceeding.\r\nBut\r\n  not all of the Breedlovesâ€™ focus in discovery was so directed.Â  During\r\n  discovery, the Breedloves sought information related to the Cramersâ€™ marriage,\r\n  their employment history, and other areas which do not implicate the Cramersâ€™\r\n  relationship with the Breedloves or transfers of asserts over the course of\r\n  that relationship.Â  Though it is possible that the discovery of information\r\n  relating to these subjects could implicate the privilege against\r\n  self-incrimination, that is not the only possibility.Â  Indeed, when judging the\r\n  invocation of the privilege in response to these and similar questions, it\r\n  might have been reasonable for the trial court to ask for more information in\r\n  order to effectively judge whether there was a reasonable possibility that\r\n  answers to these questions would provide incriminating information.Â  Lisa\r\n  Cramer offered the trial court nothing more, and for this reason, a passage in Hoffman seems to ring true:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  witness here failed to give the judge any information which would allow the\r\n  latter to rule intelligently on the claim of privilege for the witness simply\r\n  refused to say anything and gave no facts to show why he refused to say\r\n  anything.\r\n\r\n341 U.S. at 484.\r\nAs\r\n  this analysis illustrates, the fault for swaying the trial courtâ€™s attention\r\n  from the proper standard is shared among the parties.Â  For while we have\r\n  outlined why the reasons offered by the Breedloves do not measure up, we must\r\n  also reject at least part of the Cramersâ€™ argument relating to the\r\n  constitutional privilege.Â  The Cramers have maintained that once a witness\r\n  invokes the privilege against self-incrimination, that invocation is due a\r\n  significant degree of deference and the court may not inquire further.Â  Of\r\n  course, the principle of deference to a witnessâ€™s fear of self-incrimination is\r\n  included in the recognition that a court may only require a witness to answer a\r\n  question when â€œit clearly appears to the court that he is mistaken,â€ and that\r\n  â€œif the witness, upon interposing his claim, were required to prove the hazard\r\n  [of self-incrimination] in the sense in which a claim is usually required to be\r\n  established in court, he would be compelled to surrender the very protection\r\n  which the privilege is designed to guarantee.â€Â  Hoffman, 341 U.S. at 486.Â  But with these principles of deference in mind, courts have nonetheless\r\n  instructed that the question of application of the privilege is one for the\r\n  court, and that the guiding principle in a self-incrimination inquiry is the\r\n  objective reasonableness of a witnessâ€™s claimed fear of future prosecution.Â  Sharp,\r\n  920 F.2d at 1171.Â  In this case, the Cramers correctly state that the witnessâ€™s\r\n  fear of self-incrimination is due some deference, but they carry this principle\r\n  too far.Â  The final word on the application of the constitutional privilege is\r\n  one for the court and the court alone.[4]\r\nAs a\r\n  housekeeping matter, the parties appear\r\n  to have exhibited a great deal of unnecessary confusion regarding the\r\n  injunction that this Court previously issued.Â  Specifically, the parties have\r\n  expressed confusion regarding a footnote in the Courtâ€™s opinion which provides\r\n  that â€œ[s]ince possession of the assets is not at\r\n  issue in either of the Cramerâ€™s pending legal matters, we do not view the Fifth\r\n  Amendment as an impediment to the issuance of a preliminary injunction.â€Â  Grosshuesch\r\n    v. Cramer, 367 S.C. at 6 n.4, 623 S.E.2d at 835 n.4.Â  The parties have, at times, asserted the position that this\r\n  footnote represents a pronouncement from this Court on the applicability of the\r\n  Fifth Amendment.\r\nWe do not understand the source of the partiesâ€™ confusion.Â  An\r\n  injunction is binding upon the parties to\r\n  an action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon\r\n  those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual\r\n  notice of the order.Â  Rule 65(d), SCRCP.Â  The clear\r\n  import of the Courtâ€™s footnote is that because the Cramers do not contest that\r\n  they possess the property in dispute, there is no reason to doubt that the\r\n  injunction will be effective.Â  Any attempt to read more into the injunction relies\r\n  upon verbiage that is not there.[5]\r\nIn\r\n  sum, the tortured procedural history of this case illustrates that debate\r\n  regarding the application of the constitutional privilege against\r\n  self-incrimination has fueled nearly every dispute brought to the trial court\r\n  in this case.Â  The Cramers asked that this action be stayed largely on the\r\n  basis that litigating the civil proceeding would undermine their privilege\r\n  against self-incrimination, and they have reiterated this concern in their\r\n  motion to stay discovery and in response to the motions to compel and for\r\n  sanctions.Â  It is equally clear, however, that the trial court did not approach\r\n  the question involving the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination\r\n  from the proper perspective.Â  For this\r\n  reason, we must vacate the trial courtâ€™s order finding Lisa Cramer in\r\n  contempt.Â  It should not be necessary to reiterate that when judging the\r\n  invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination, the trial court must\r\n  make a question-specific inquiry, focusing on whether a question is incriminating on its face, whether the question can be\r\n  shown to be incriminating through further contextual proof, and whether there\r\n  is a sufficient possibility of criminal prosecution to trigger the privilege.Â \r\n \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Attorneysâ€™\r\n  Appeals\r\nThe Cramersâ€™ attorneys argue that the trial court\r\n  erred in finding them in contempt for failing to comply with the Breedlovesâ€™\r\n  subpoenas duces tecum.Â  We agree.[6]\r\nWe can resolve this\r\n  issue rather quickly, because the documents the Breedloves sought through the\r\n  subpoenas are not properly discoverable through the Cramersâ€™ attorneys.Â  Looking\r\n  first at the courtâ€™s order to Lionel Lofton, Lisa Cramerâ€™s attorney, the order\r\n  requires Lofton to produce â€œany and all documents he has in his possession\r\n  which disclose the location of any funds obtained by [Lisa Cramer] from the\r\n  Breedloves,â€ and the order further requires Lofton to disclose the amounts of\r\n  any and all funds currently held in escrow or on deposit by him or his firm.Â \r\n  This request is indistinguishable from the discovery the Breedloves sought from\r\n  the Cramers, and it is clear that Lofton would only have obtained documents\r\n  relating to the Cramersâ€™ finances through his status as Lisa Cramerâ€™s\r\n  attorney.Â  The Breedloves cannot discover documents through the Cramersâ€™ attorneys\r\n  when the compelled disclosure by the Cramers would be protected by the\r\n  privilege against self-incrimination.Â  Thus, although the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct provide that an attorney may disclose privileged information when\r\n  ordered by the court, see Rule 1.6(b)(7), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, we find\r\n  the disclosure ordered here highly improper.\r\nThe order directed\r\n  to Charles Macloskie, Nathan Cramerâ€™s attorney, provides another illustrative\r\n  point.Â  Specifically, the order professes that the Breedloves are seeking the\r\n  information described in the subpoenas â€œin aid of enforcing an injunction\r\n  issued by [this Court],â€ and that â€œwithout the information, [the Breedloves]\r\n  cannot locate or trace the assets that are the subject of [this Courtâ€™s]\r\n  injunction.â€Â  This justification is completely at odds with the purpose of\r\n  discovery and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding by the Breedloves of\r\n  their obligations in connection with this Courtâ€™s injunction.Â  Discovery is, of\r\n  course, the process of seeking information from an adverse party to prepare for\r\n  litigation, and the discovery sought in this case relates largely to the nature\r\n  of the Breedlovesâ€™ relationship with the Cramers.Â  The Cramers have refused to\r\n  respond to this discovery by asserting the constitutional privilege against\r\n  self-incrimination, and this Courtâ€™s issuance of an injunction has no impact on\r\n  this analysis.Â   \r\nIf\r\n  the privilege against self-incrimination protects the Cramers from disclosing\r\n  the location of their assets to the Breedloves, that is the end of the\r\n  matter.Â Â  The Courtâ€™s issuance of an injunction does not grant the Breedloves a\r\n  license to use discovery as a tool to ensure that the injunction is being given\r\n  effect.Â  As a court order, the injunction is binding on the Cramers, their\r\n  agents and attorneys, and anyone in active concert with the Cramers receiving actual\r\n  notice of the injunction.Â  Rule 65(d), SCRCP.Â  A party who refuses to abide by\r\n  an injunction entered by the court would of course be in contempt of court and\r\n  subject to sanctions, and our jurisprudence clearly establishes that the proper\r\n  procedure to determine whether a party should be held in contempt is to bring a\r\n  summons and a rule to show cause.Â  See Toyota of Florence, Inc. v. Lynch,\r\n  314 S.C. 257, 267, 442 S.E.2d 611, 617 (1994).Â  Treating the injunction as a\r\n  back door to allow the discovery of otherwise non-discoverable information\r\n  gives the privilege against self-incrimination an impermissibly shallow\r\n  dimension.\r\nNot\r\n  to be outdone, the Cramers also misunderstand an important aspect of this\r\n  Courtâ€™s injunction.Â  Specifically, the Cramers appear to overextend the\r\n  privilege against self-incrimination and treat it as a limitation on what\r\n  information a court may ascertain in its own right.Â  Stated differently, the\r\n  question of what information the Breedloves may not obtain in discovery is completely\r\n  separate from what information a court may require to be disclosed, in\r\n    camera if necessary, to ensure that court orders are observed.Â  While the\r\n  appearance that the Cramers are using money they obtained from the Breedloves\r\n  to pay their attorneysâ€™ fees ought to be of significant concern, and thus, the Breedlovesâ€™ desire for\r\n  this information is understandable, this issue should be resolved rather\r\n  quickly and easily without the involvement of the civil discovery process.\r\nFor these reasons, we reverse the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision finding the Cramersâ€™ attorneys in contempt.  \r\nIII. &amp; IV.Â Â  The\r\n  Protective Order &amp; The Order Denying Contempt\r\nThe Breedloves\r\n  argue that the trial court erred in issuing a protective order over discovery\r\n  in this case and in denying their second request for contempt and sanctions as\r\n  to Lisa Cramer.Â  Though these issues raise interesting questions, the fact\r\n  remains that discovery orders, in general, are interlocutory and are not\r\n  immediately appealable because they do not, within the meaning of the\r\n  appealability statute, involve the merits of the action or affect a substantial\r\n  right.Â  Hamm v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 312 S.C. 238, 241, 439\r\n  S.E.2d 852, 853 (1994); Wallace v. Interamerican Trust Co., 246 S.C.\r\n  563, 568-69, 144 S.E.2d 813, 816 (1965).[7] Â \r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, these appeals are vacated in part, reversed in part, and\r\n  dismissed in part.Â  Specifically, we vacate the trial courtâ€™s order finding Lisa\r\n  Cramer in contempt; we reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding of contempt as to the\r\n  Cramersâ€™ attorneys; and we dismiss the remaining appeals as interlocutory and\r\n  not immediately appealable.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] Counsel for Nathan Cramer did not appear at the hearing on the motion to\r\n  compel.Â  From this point on, the parties appear to have been content to\r\n  litigate these discovery disputes solely from Lisa Cramerâ€™s perspective. \r\n \r\n[2] As our recitation of the law illustrates, there is a great deal of\r\n  jurisprudence interpreting the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s privilege against\r\n  self-incrimination and setting forth clear guideposts for judging an invocation\r\n  of the privilege.Â  The parties have not offered any arguments as to how the\r\n  analysis might differ under Article 1, Section 12 of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution, so we assume in this case that the analysis under the two\r\n  provisions is identical.\r\n[3] The case Raffell v. United States, 271 U.S. 494 (1926), is not to the\r\n  contrary.Â  That case deals with the entirely different question of whether\r\n  inconsistent conduct with respect to the invocation of the Fifth Amendment may\r\n  be used as impeachment evidence if a party takes the witness stand.\r\n[4] Though the trial courtâ€™s protective order regarding discovery is the subject of\r\n  a separate issue on appeal, we note that the use of protective orders has been\r\n  widely rejected as a prophylactic measure which cures the compelled disclosure\r\n  of incriminating information.Â  As this Court and the federal courts have made\r\n  clear, if the privilege against self-incrimination applies, the government must\r\n  either be content with having no response to its inquiry, or must grant the\r\n  witness immunity.Â  See State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 301, 440 S.E.2d\r\n  341, 351 (1994) (interpreting S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12); Kastigar v. United\r\n    States, 406 U.S. 441 (1972) (addressing the Fifth Amendment).Â  Although\r\n  this principle is admittedly problematic in the civil context because neither a\r\n  civil plaintiff nor a judge in a civil action possesses the power to grant a\r\n  witness immunity, the principle simply establishes that in a civil action, a\r\n  court may not compel a witness to disclose information to an adverse party if the court finds that the privilege against self-incrimination is properly\r\n  asserted.\r\n[5] Furthermore, although the issue is not raised in this appeal, the parties expressed\r\n  confusion in the trial court on the issue of posting a bond for the\r\n  injunction.Â  In our review of the trial courtâ€™s denial of an injunction, the\r\n  only issue presented was whether the trial court erred in holding that the\r\n  Breedloves had an adequate remedy at law to secure the $2 million originally in\r\n  the Cramersâ€™ Merrill Lynch account.Â  We held that attachment was not an\r\n  adequate remedy at law, and we remanded the matter to the trial court to\r\n  proceed accordingly.Â  The rule governing the issuance of injunctions controls\r\n  whether the Breedloves are required to post a bond to secure the injunction in\r\n  this case, see Rule 65(c), SCRCP, and the proposition that this Court\r\n  somehow suspended the operation of this requirement is wholly inaccurate.\r\n[6] This issue is, of course, presently appealable because the trial court held the\r\n  Cramersâ€™ attorneys in contempt, and we review a trial courtâ€™s imposition of\r\n  discovery sanctions under an abuse of discretion standard.Â  See Ex parte\r\n    Whetstone, 289 S.C. 580, 581-81, 347 S.E.2d 881, 881-82 (1986); Laney v.\r\n      Hefley, 262 S.C. 54, 58, 202 S.E.2d 12, 14 (1974).\r\n[7] We take this opportunity to reiterate that while an appeal is pending, a lower\r\n  court cannot act on matters affecting the issue on appeal.Â  See Rules\r\n  205 &amp; 225, SCACR.Â  In the instant case, the trial courtâ€™s orders dealing\r\n  with contempt did not run afoul of this proscription, because while the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s first order deals with the subject of the Cramersâ€™ initial discovery\r\n  responses, the second order deals with the subject of Lisa Cramerâ€™s responses\r\n  to questions in her deposition.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26454","title":"In the Matter of Thurmond Brooker","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26454","description":"In this opinion, the Court publicly reprimands Thurmond Brooker.","date":"2008-03-10","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Thurmond Brooker, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.26454\r\nSubmitted February 4, 2008 - Filed March\r\n  10, 2008\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.

Â We accept the\r\n  Agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nMatter A\r\nRespondent filed a summons and complaint\r\n  on behalf of a plaintiff in a lawsuit, but performed no other work on the case\r\n  thereafter.Â  Respondent maintains he did not represent the plaintiff, but filed\r\n  the summons and complaint on the plaintiffâ€™s behalf because she was a friend.Â \r\n  However, the plaintiff believed respondent represented her and relied upon him\r\n  to follow through with the action.Â  When the plaintiff informed respondent she\r\n  was no longer interested in his services, respondent offered the plaintiff\r\n  $1,300.Â  Respondent maintains the money was offered to the plaintiff to assist\r\n  her in hiring a lawyer to represent her in the lawsuit and because he felt bad\r\n  that she was not satisfied with his assistance in the case.\r\nRespondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate with ODC when\r\n  ODC notified him of the disciplinary complaint filed by the plaintiff.Â \r\n  Respondent eventually responded to ODC, after being sent a letter pursuant to In\r\n    the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), and over three\r\n  months after the deadline set forth in ODCâ€™s original request for a response.\r\nMatter B\r\nRespondent\r\n  was retained to represent two minors in personal injury cases.Â  The mother\r\n  (Mother) of the minors signed retainer agreements on behalf of the minors,\r\n  which stated respondent would investigate the matters to determine whether the\r\n  clients could recover in the matters, but if he determined they could not, he\r\n  reserved the right to withdraw from representation upon written notification to\r\n  the clients.Â  Respondent maintains he reviewed the cases and determined they\r\n  were not legally sufficient for a lawsuit; therefore, he did not file a lawsuit\r\n  in either case and subsequently closed his file on the cases.Â   \r\nMother alleges respondent failed to keep her informed of the\r\n  status of the cases and failed to respond to her requests for information for\r\n  over one year.Â  Respondent states he does not recall whether he notified Mother\r\n  of his decision regarding the merits of the cases nor does he recall advising\r\n  her of his decision to close his file on both cases.Â  Respondent has provided\r\n  no evidence that he notified Mother in writing of his decision in either case.Â \r\n  Respondentâ€™s failure to notify the minors and Mother of his decision not to\r\n  file suit in their cases denied them the right to make an informed decision\r\n  regarding the pursuit of their cases because the statute of limitations had\r\n  expired in both cases by the time Mother learned of respondentâ€™s decision.\r\nMatter C\r\nODC\r\n  notified respondent, by letter dated February 12, 2007, of a complaint against\r\n  him, and asked respondent to respond within fifteen days.Â  On March 6, 2007,\r\n  not having received a response, ODC sent respondent a letter pursuant to In\r\n    the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), again requesting\r\n  a response.Â  Respondent failed to respond, and on May 2, 2007, ODC served\r\n  respondent with a notice of full investigation requesting a written response\r\n  within thirty days.Â  Respondentâ€™s letter of response, dated June 2, 2007, was\r\n  received by ODC on June 7, 2007, over three months after the deadline in ODCâ€™s\r\n  original request.Â  ODC ultimately determined the allegations in the complaint\r\n  were without merit.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s decisions\r\n  concerning the objectives of representation and shall consult with the client\r\n  as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (lawyer\r\n  shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client);\r\n  Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall reasonably consult with the client about\r\n  the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished, keep the\r\n  client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly comply\r\n  with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.8(e) (a lawyer shall not\r\n  provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or\r\n  contemplated litigation); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to\r\n  expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client); Rule 8.1(b)\r\n  (a lawyer, in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not knowingly fail\r\n  to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or\r\n  disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial\r\n  to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent\r\n  further admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (it\r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find\r\n  respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public\r\n  reprimand. Accordingly, we accept the Agreement and\r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC\r\n  REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ.,\r\n    concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26456","title":"In the Matter of Adrian Edward Cooper","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26456","description":"In this opinion, the Court disbars Adrian Edward Cooper.","date":"2008-03-10","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Adrian Edward Cooper, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26456\r\nSubmitted February 4, 2008 - Filed March\r\n  10, 2008\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.

(Wife) in a divorce matter filed\r\n  in 1999.Â  Respondent was directed by the trial judge to draft a proposed\r\n  qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) regarding the court-ordered share of\r\n  Wifeâ€™s draw from the retirement account of her husband (Husband).Â  The order\r\n  was signed by the judge and opposing counsel and filed in 2000.Â  Respondent\r\n  furnished a copy of the order to Husbandâ€™s retirement plan administrator.Â  The\r\n  administrator notified respondent by letter that the terms of the order allowed\r\n  payment to Wife only if Husband terminated his employment, but had no provision\r\n  for his retirement or death.Â  The administrator also asked respondent if the\r\n  terms of the order were intended to limit Wifeâ€™s payout.Â  Respondent did not\r\n  respond to the letter and took no action to correct the order.\r\nIn\r\n  2005, respondent received notice that Husband had retired.Â  At that time,\r\n  respondent amended the QDRO and submitted it to opposing counsel.Â  When\r\n  respondent did not receive the signed order back from opposing counsel, he\r\n  forged the signatures of opposing counsel and the judge and filed the order\r\n  with the clerk of court in April 2006.Â  The forged order was submitted to Husbandâ€™s\r\n  retirement plan administrator in May 2006.Â  Husband became aware of the order\r\n  and contacted counsel.Â  Husbandâ€™s counsel contacted respondent and submitted a\r\n  consent order vacating the amended QDRO.Â  The judge issued an order finding the\r\n  QDRO was a forgery and vacating it.Â  Ultimately, a duly executed amended QDRO\r\n  was filed and accepted and Wife is now receiving the benefits to which she is\r\n  entitled.\r\nReal Estate Matter\r\nIn\r\n  November 2006, respondent was paid $250 to conduct a title search and prepare a\r\n  deed for property a client intended to purchase from a seller residing\r\n  out-of-state.Â  The client delivered $16,500 to respondent to hold in escrow for\r\n  the seller until the deed was delivered.Â  The deed was not delivered until June\r\n  2007 because of delays not attributable to respondent.\r\nBetween\r\n  November 2006 and June 2007, respondent used portions of the funds to be held\r\n  in trust for office expenses.Â  By the time the seller delivered the deed in\r\n  June 2007, respondent had misappropriated the full amount of the funds.Â \r\n  Respondent sold property he owned to replenish the funds.Â  He delivered a trust\r\n  account check to the seller with a request that the seller not negotiate it\r\n  immediately based on respondentâ€™s expectation that the proceeds of his own sale\r\n  would be available in the trust account to cover the check.Â  The seller\r\n  negotiated the check upon receipt and it was returned for insufficient funds.Â \r\n  The seller contacted respondent, who requested that the seller present the\r\n  check to the bank a second time.Â  By that time, respondent had replenished the\r\n  funds in the trust account with his own money and the check to the seller was\r\n  paid.\r\nFailure to Cooperate\r\nIn response to the complaint in this matter, respondent initially\r\n  denied any wrongdoing.Â  In connection with the investigation into the\r\n  allegations against respondent, ODC issued a subpoena for respondentâ€™s bank and\r\n  other financial records maintained pursuant to Rule 417, SCACR, for a period of\r\n  one year preceding delivery of the check written on insufficient funds.Â \r\n  Respondent filed a motion to quash the subpoena on grounds it was overbroad and\r\n  invasive.Â  The Investigative Panel denied the motion and issued its order\r\n  requiring respondent to comply with the subpoena.Â  Respondent attempted to\r\n  appeal the order.Â  The Chair of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct issued a\r\n  letter to respondent explaining that, pursuant to Rule 15(e), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, the order was not appealable and that he\r\n  was required to comply with the subpoena immediately or face contempt charges and\r\n  possibly interim suspension.Â  Respondent did not comply with the subpoena.Â \r\n  This Court then issued its order placing respondent on interim suspension and\r\n  also issued a rule to show cause.Â  Respondent then produced his records, which\r\n  show misappropriation of the escrowed funds.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with\r\n  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s\r\n  possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own\r\n  property); Rule 3.3 (a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a\r\n  false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the\r\n  lawyer); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client\r\n  a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to\r\n  a third person); Rule 8.1(b) (a lawyer, in connection with a disciplinary\r\n  matter, shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information\r\n  from an admissions or disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(b) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects\r\n  adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in\r\n  other respects); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to\r\n  engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation);\r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in\r\n  conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent\r\n  further admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground\r\n  for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice, bring the courts or legal profession into disrepute,\r\n  or demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be a\r\n  ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the oath of office).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and disbar\r\n  respondent from the practice of law in this state retroactive to November 13,\r\n  2007.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall\r\n  file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with\r\n  Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of\r\n  Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was

Spears, of\r\n  Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MOORE:Â Â  In this case, Appellants appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order\r\n  granting partial summary judgment in favor of Respondents regarding the meaning\r\n  of a statute that requires hospitals to offer certain discounts to an insurer\r\n  who provides a specific type of health insurance contract.Â  The circuit court\r\n  held that Appellants violated the statute.Â  We disagree and reverse.  \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nRespondents[1] (hereinafter â€œPatientsâ€) filed an action against Appellants (hereinafter\r\n  â€œHospitalsâ€) for failing to comply with S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-71-120 (2002) (repealed by Act No. 332, Â§ 31, 2006 S.C. Acts\r\n  2624, 2661) (hereinafter â€œthe Discount Statuteâ€), which provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhenever\r\n  an insurer contracts with a hospital to provide full hospital service and\r\n  medical care service contracts for its policy owners in the same manner as\r\n  described in Chapters 13 and 14 of Title 37 of the 1962 Code and arranges with\r\n  the hospital for payment of claims under procedures described in Chapters 13\r\n  and 14 of Title 37 of the 1962 Code, the insurer is entitled to the same\r\n  discounts allowed to any insurer.Â  Any person making full payment for hospital\r\n  services within seven days from receipt of a bill for such services shall be\r\n  entitled to the same discount allowed to any insurer. \r\n\r\nHospitals\r\n  currently bill their patients the same amount for identical procedures based on\r\n  a Charge Master,[2] but Hospitals give different discounts on these procedures depending on\r\n  Hospitalsâ€™ contracts with a patientâ€™s insurance company.Â  Patients filed the\r\n  instant action against Hospitals, arguing that these current billing practices violated\r\n  the Discount Statute.Â  In response, Hospitals contended that the Discount\r\n  Statute was an outdated statute that had no application because insurance\r\n  companies do not currently offer â€œfull hospital service and medical care\r\n  service contractsâ€ to which the Discount Statute applies and that no insurer\r\n  contracts with Hospitals â€œin the same manner as described in Chapters 13 and 14\r\n  of Title 37 of the 1962 Code.â€Â  The parties filed cross motions for summary\r\n  judgment, and after a hearing, the circuit court granted partial summary\r\n  judgment in favor of Patients.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court first noted that the manner in which insurance companies provide\r\n  health insurance to their policyholders has changed since the Discount Statute\r\n  was first enacted.Â  However, the circuit court rejected Hospitalsâ€™ argument\r\n  that full service contracts no longer exist.Â  Rather, the circuit court held\r\n  that all of the contracts involved in this litigation were service contracts,\r\n  as opposed to indemnity contracts, and thus, under a progressive reading of the\r\n  statute, the Discount Statute applied to the current contracts utilized by\r\n  Hospitals.Â  Additionally, the circuit court held that the requirement that an\r\n  insurer must contract â€œin the same manner as described in Chapters 13 and 14 of\r\n  Title 37 of the South Carolina Codeâ€ simply meant that the insurer must\r\n  contract directly with Hospitals and determined that insurers currently\r\n  contract with Hospitals in this same manner.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court\r\n  ruled that the Discount Statute required the Hospitals to offer uniform\r\n  discounts to all insured Patients.Â  Additionally, the circuit court held that\r\n  the second sentence of the Discount Statute required Hospitals to provide\r\n  uninsured Patients with a bill reflecting the lowest discount offered to any\r\n  insurer.Â  Because Hospitals admitted that they failed to do so, the circuit\r\n  court ruled that Hospitals violated the Discount Statute.[3]Â   \r\nHospitals\r\n  appealed and we certified this case pursuant to 204(b), SCACR.Â  Hospitals\r\n  present the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tIs the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s interpretation of the Discount Statute erroneous as a matter of\r\n  law because it is against the legislative intent and ignores the plain meaning\r\n  of the terms?[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of\r\n  Review\r\nThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for\r\n  the court.Â  Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. State, 372\r\n  S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).Â \r\n  In a case raising a novel question of law regarding the interpretation of a\r\n  statute, the appellate court is free to decide the question with no particular\r\n  deference to the lower court.Â  New York Times\r\n    Co. v. Spartanburg County Sch. Dist. No. 7, 374\r\n  S.C. 307, 309, 649 S.E.2d 28, 29 (2007).\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. Insured Patients\r\nHospitals argue\r\n  that the circuit court erred in holding that the Discount Statute mandates that\r\n  Hospitals provide uniform discounts to all insured Patients.Â  Hospitals\r\n  maintain that the legislature intended for the Discount Statute to apply to\r\n  â€œfull hospital service and medical care service contracts,â€ which no longer\r\n  exist, and that no insurer contracts â€œin the same manner as described in\r\n  Chapters 13 and 14 of Title 37, Code of Laws of South Carolina 1962.â€Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and\r\n  effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v.\r\n    State Budget and Control Bd., 313\r\n  S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993).Â  All rules of statutory\r\n  construction are subservient to the one that the legislative intent must\r\n  prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that\r\n  language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute. Â Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Commâ€™n, 342\r\n  S.C. 373, 380, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  The history of the period in which the statute was passed may be\r\n  considered in interpreting the statute.Â  Catawba Indian\r\n    Tribe of South Carolina v. State, 372\r\n  S.C. 519 n.6, 642 S.E.2d 751 n.6 (2007).Â   \r\nIn\r\n  1946, Blue Cross and Blue Shield (â€œBCBSâ€) received a charter from the State\r\n  pursuant Act No. 417, 1946 S.C. Acts 1304, later codified as Chapters 13 and\r\n  14, Title 37, of the 1962 Code.Â  This charter enabled BCBS to be organized as a\r\n  nonprofit corporation and this statutory framework authorized BCBS to only sell\r\n  â€œservice contractsâ€[5] for hospital and medical care services.Â  Under these contracts, the hospital agreed to provide hospital services to\r\n  all BCBS subscribers. By statute, BCBS was required to pay the hospital\r\n  directly, and individual policyholders owed no financial responsibility to the\r\n  hospital.Â  Medical care service contracts were similar agreements with\r\n  physicians which enabled physicians to provide medical care services to all\r\n  BCBS subscribers.Â  In contrast, mutual insurance companies, which were\r\n  regulated by the Department of Insurance, could only sell â€œindemnity contractsâ€\r\n  and were prohibited from selling service benefit contracts.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  1967, the General Assembly appointed a committee (â€œS-3 Committeeâ€) to examine South Carolinaâ€™s health insurance laws.Â  The S-3 Committee determined that BCBS could not\r\n  profitably operate within the confines of Chapters 13 and 14 due to the\r\n  advancement in healthcare, and that BCBS had already been acting outside the\r\n  scope of its statutory charter by selling indemnity contracts.Â  The S-3\r\n  Committee also determined that BCBS was able to negotiate with the hospitals\r\n  and doctors for discounts while the mutual insurance companies could not so\r\n  negotiate.Â  Because BCBS received discounts which were unavailable to the\r\n  mutual insurance companies and because BCBS was a tax-exempt entity, the S-3\r\n  Committee found that BCBS attained an unfair advantage over mutual insurance\r\n  companies.Â  Accordingly, the S-3 Committee recommended, among other things,\r\n  that the legislature enact legislation eliminating the distinction between\r\n  Chapters 13 and 14 nonprofit insurance companies and mutual insurance companies\r\n  by allowing both to sell service contracts and indemnity contracts.Â \r\n  Additionally, the S-3 Committee recommended that hospitals be required to offer\r\n  all insurance companies uniform discounts.\r\nIn\r\n  response to the S-3 Committeeâ€™s study, the Chief Insurance Commissioner\r\n  submitted proposed legislation regarding uniform discounts.Â  The Commissionerâ€™s\r\n  proposed legislation would have simply made it unlawful for any health care\r\n  facility that contracted with any insurer â€œto discriminate by offering or\r\n  granting discounts to such service or insurance organizationâ€ and would have required\r\n  any discount to be uniform to all patients.\r\nIn\r\n  1968, as a result of the S-3 Committeeâ€™s recommendations, the legislature\r\n  passed the predecessor to the current Discount Statute which provided:\r\n\r\n\tWhenever\r\n  any insurance company, including corporations organized under Chapter 13 and 14\r\n  of Title 37, Code of Laws of South Carolina 1962, contracts with a hospital to\r\n  provide full hospital service and medical care service contracts for its policy\r\n  owners in the same or a comparable manner as such coverage is provided by\r\n  corporations organized under Chapters 13 and 14 of Title 37 and such insurers\r\n  arrange with the hospital for payment of claims under procedures used by\r\n  corporations under Chapters 13 and 14 of Title 37, such insurers shall be\r\n  entitled to the same discount allowed to any insurer and any person making full\r\n  payment for hospital services within seven days from receipt of a bill for such\r\n  services shall be entitled to the same discount allowed to any insurer.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nAct No. 1096, Â§ 1, 1968 S.C.\r\n  Acts 2582.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  and in accordance with the S-3 Committeeâ€™s recommendation, the legislature repealed\r\n  Chapters 13 and 14.Â  This repeal transformed BCBS from a nonprofit corporation into\r\n  a mutual insurance company.Â  The legislature also amended the code to allow\r\n  both nonprofit organizations and mutual insurance companies to issue service\r\n  contracts and indemnity contracts.Â  In 1987, the legislature amended the\r\n  Discount Statute to its current version.Â Â Â   \r\nHospitals\r\n  argue that, considering the statuteâ€™s text and the history in which it was\r\n  passed, the Discount Statute is an outdated statute that has no application to todayâ€™s\r\n  health insurance contracts.Â  Specifically, Hospitals contend that the legislature\r\n  intended for the Discount Statute to strictly apply to service contracts as\r\n  recognized in 1967, which are no longer used, and to insurers that contract â€œin\r\n  the same manner as described in Chapters 13 and 14 of Title 37 of the 1962 Code.â€Â \r\n  Patients, on the other hand, argue that the circuit court correctly interpreted\r\n  the Discount Statute to apply to current health insurance contracts and that\r\n  such interpretation is consistent with the legislative intent.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  hold that the circuit court erroneously construed the Discount Statute to apply\r\n  to the current health insurance contracts for several reasons.Â  Foremost, and contrary\r\n  to the circuit courtâ€™s broad interpretation, service contracts are a specific\r\n  and narrow group of prepaid health insurance contracts that stand in sharp\r\n  contrast to health insurance contracts currently employed or utilized by Patientsâ€™\r\n  insurers.Â  By statute, service contracts required an insurer to pay the\r\n  hospital directly and the insurer was further prohibited from charging the\r\n  subscriber a co-payment or deductible or holding a policyholder financially\r\n  responsible for any covered service.Â  See S.C. Code of Laws Â§ 37-1063\r\n  (1962) (providing that â€œ[a]ll contracts . . . shall be a direct obligation of\r\n  the corporation to pay the hospital in cash for authorized services rendered a\r\n  subscriber; but the subscriber shall be personally liable for any hospital\r\n  service not paid by the corporation to the hospitalâ€); and S.C. Code of Laws Â§\r\n  37-1054 (1962) (providing that the purpose of Chapter 13 nonprofit corporations\r\n  shall be to furnish hospital services â€œin consideration of the payment by such\r\n  subscribers of a definite sum for the hospital care so contracted\r\n  to be furnishedâ€) (emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s categorization of current health insurance contracts as\r\n  â€œservice contractsâ€ simply because a subscriber receives services from the hospital\r\n  constitutes manifest error when the statuteâ€™s terms are given their plain\r\n  meaning.[6]Â \r\n  This generalization ignores the plain meaning of the term â€œservice contractâ€\r\n  and impermissibly expands the scope of the Discount Statute.Â  Brown v. S.C. Dept. of Health and Envtl.\r\n    Control, 348\r\n  S.C. 507, 515, 560, S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002)\r\n  (holding that where the terms of the statute are clear, the court\r\n  must apply those terms according to their literal meaning, and an appellate\r\n  court may not resort to a forced interpretation in an attempt to expand or\r\n  limit the scope of a statute). Thus, because the Discount Statute applies to service contracts and no\r\n  insurer offers such contracts today, Patients failed to show that the Discount\r\n  Statute applies.\r\nAlong\r\n  the same lines, we also find that the circuit court erred in holding that the\r\n  language â€œin the same manner as described in Chapters 13 and 14 of Title 37 of\r\n  the South Carolina Codeâ€ simply meant that the insurer must contract directly\r\n  with Hospitals.Â  The language of the Discount Statute clearly requires that in\r\n  order to qualify for the discount, the insurer must adhere to particular\r\n  statutory requirements as set forth in Chapters 13 and 14, a statutory scheme\r\n  to which Patientsâ€™ insurers do not follow.Â  Accordingly, because no insurer\r\n  contracts with Hospitals in this same manner, the Discount Statute is not\r\n  applicable to Patients.Â  See The\r\n    Honorable Francis X. Archibald, 1984\r\n  WL 249791 (1984) (noting\r\n  that â€œin order to get the discount the insurer would\r\n  have to . . . make payments the same way that nonprofit hospital and medical\r\n  service corporations doâ€ and that â€œ[a]n insurer which does business any\r\n    other way is ineligibleâ€) (emphasis added).\r\nPatients argue that the Court should broadly interpret the\r\n  Discount Statute to apply to current health insurance contracts because current\r\n  contracts share similarities with service contracts.Â  While Patients may be\r\n  factually correct in that similarities exist, we believe that the text of the\r\n  Discount Statute and its legislative history require a strict interpretation.Â \r\n  First, the legislature rejected the Insurance Commissionerâ€™s proposed\r\n  legislation which would have mandated broad,\r\n  uniform discounts to all contracts for health insurance.Â  Second, the legislature\r\n  amended the Discount Statute in 1987 by deleting the â€œor comparableâ€ language,\r\n  and thus requiring insurers to contract and arrange for payment â€œin the same\r\n  mannerâ€ as described in Chapters 13 and 14.Â  We believe that this change\r\n  indicates that the legislature intended to focus on the precise requirements of\r\n  Chapters 13 and 14.Â  This further illustrates that an insurer is only entitled\r\n  to the same discount under the specific conditions set forth in Chapters 13 and\r\n  14, which are no longer used.Â Â  See Denene, Inc.\r\n    v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 212,\r\n  574 S.E.2d 196, 198 (2002) (holding that the\r\n  Court must presume the legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather\r\n  intended its statutes to accomplish something).Â  Finally, the fact that\r\n  the legislature repealed the Discount Statute immediately after the circuit\r\n  court issued its order, in our view, also indicates that the legislature did\r\n  not intend for the Discount Statute to apply to current health insurance\r\n  contracts.Â Â   \r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit court erred in broadly\r\n  interpreting the Discount Statute to apply to current health insurance\r\n  contracts.Â   \r\nII. Uninsured Patients\r\nThe\r\n  second sentence of the Discount Statute provides: â€œAny person making full\r\n  payment for hospital services within seven days from receipt of a bill for such\r\n  services shall be entitled to the same discount allowed to any insurer.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-71-120.Â  Hospitals argue that the Discount Statute does not\r\n  apply to uninsured Patientsâ€™ claims because the second sentence of the statute\r\n  must be read in conjunction with the first sentence, which is outdated and no\r\n  longer applicable.Â  We agree.Â   \r\n&nbsp;â€œThe well-settled rule in South Carolina is that, where\r\n  possible, all provisions of a statute must be given full force and effect.â€Â  Nucor Steel v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 310\r\n  S.C. 539, 545, 426 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1992).Â \r\n  However, the primary rule of statutory construction is to\r\n  ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature, and in ascertaining the intent of the legislature, a court should not focus on any\r\n  single section or provision but should consider the language of the statute as\r\n  a whole.Â  Mid-State Auto Auction\r\n    of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324\r\n  S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â   \r\nWe hold that the two sentences in the\r\n  Discount Statute may not be read independently, but must be read in conjunction\r\n  with one another in order to ascertain the legislative intent.Â  Doing so leads\r\n  to the interpretation that an uninsured Patient is entitled to the same\r\n  discount afforded an insurer who qualifies for the discount under the first\r\n  sentence of the Discount Statute.Â  In other words, an uninsured Patient is\r\n  entitled to the same discount that an insurer who contracts with a hospital to\r\n  provide â€œfull hospital service and medical care service . . . in the same\r\n  mannerâ€ as described in Chapters 13 and 14.Â  However, because service contracts\r\n  are no longer in existence and insurers do not contract in the same manner as\r\n  Chapters 13 and 14 corporations, we hold that there is no â€œsame discountâ€\r\n  available to uninsured Patients.Â  The second sentence of the statute is not\r\n  meaningless, but rather, the statute as a whole is simply not relevant because\r\n  the contracts described therein are not used in the current health care\r\n  industry.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the circuit court erred in holding that\r\n  the Discount Statute applied to uninsured Patients.Â   \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold the circuit court erred in interpreting the\r\n  Discount Statute, and therefore, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s grant of\r\n  partial summary judgment to Patients.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr. and Edward B.\r\n  Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The class of Respondents consists of insured and uninsured Patients, whose\r\n  claims we address separately.Â  Additionally, references to â€œpatientsâ€ or\r\n  â€œhospitalsâ€ do not refer to either the Respondents or Appellants in this\r\n  action.Â  Instead, such references apply just to hospitals or patients in\r\n  general.Â   \r\n[2] A Charge Master is a list of each medical procedure or service and its cost\r\n  that a hospital provides.Â   \r\n[3] Following the circuit courtâ€™s order, the legislature repealed the Discount\r\n  Statute.\r\n[4] Although Hospitals present several other issues for review, we find it\r\n  unnecessary to address those issues based on our holding on this central\r\n  issue.Â Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding that the Court need not rule on remaining issues when the\r\n  disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n[5] These types of contracts are referred to as â€œservice contracts,â€ â€œfull service\r\n  contracts,â€ and â€œservice benefit contracts.â€Â   \r\n[6] Additionally, we note that the circuit courtâ€™s narrow definition of an\r\n  indemnity contract as exclusively one in which the subscriber pays the\r\n  hospital and the insurer then provides a cash reimbursement to the subscriber\r\n  is not consistent with South Carolina law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-1-20(19) (2006) (defining insurance as â€œa contract\r\n  whereby one undertakes to indemnify another or pay a specified amount upon\r\n  determinable contingenciesâ€).

Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â \r\n  In this post-conviction relief (PCR) case, the Court granted the Stateâ€™s\r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s decision granting\r\n  relief with respect to Patrick Delvon Harrisâ€™s conviction for armed robbery and\r\n  sentence of imprisonment for life without parole (LWOP).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt\r\n  approximately 12:00 a.m. on March 26, 1998, Jessie Brown and Kevin Outen,\r\n  employees with Park Place Video in Columbia, observed an African-American male\r\n  walk through the video poker establishment and leave after staying only a few\r\n  minutes.Â  Both employees believed the man was â€œscoping outâ€ the place.  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Brown, the same man returned at 2:00 a.m.Â  At that time, Outen was on the\r\n  phone with the store manager.Â  Outen â€œbuzzed inâ€ the man unaware that he was\r\n  accompanied by two masked men.Â  As the men â€œrushedâ€ in, one of the masked men\r\n  pointed a gun at Outen and ordered him to hang up the phone and get on the\r\n  floor.Â  Outen complied but left the phone on the counter so that the manager\r\n  could hear what was transpiring in the store.Â  The other masked man ordered\r\n  Brown at gunpoint to show him where the store kept the money.Â  The man then\r\n  took the money and handed it to one of his accomplices.Â  Outen was then led by\r\n  one of the masked men to a back room where two customers had been playing video\r\n  poker.Â  After hearing the commotion, the customers hid in the room and locked\r\n  the door.Â  The masked man kicked open the door and ordered Outen and the two\r\n  customers at gunpoint to get on the ground and remain in the room.Â  While they\r\n  were in the room, the three captives heard several gunshots before the robbers\r\n  exited the store.Â  Shortly after the gunshots ended, one of the customers heard\r\n  a car drive off.\r\nAccording\r\n  to Brown, the men â€œtore the place upâ€ and then fired several gunshots before\r\n  leaving.Â  Brown identified the man that accosted him as the last man to leave\r\n  the premises.Â  He described this man as wearing a mask, a dark brown leather\r\n  coat, and black leather pants.Â  Â Â \r\nWhen\r\n  Brown emerged from one of the back rooms, deputies with the Richland County\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department were already on the scene having been summoned by a 911\r\n  call placed by the store manager who heard the commotion while speaking with\r\n  Outen on the telephone.Â   \r\nDeputies\r\n  Ray Livingston and Jason Christophel, who were separately patrolling the Parklane Road area, responded to the call within less than a minute.Â  When they arrived,\r\n  they observed a masked man wearing black pants and a dark leather jacket exit\r\n  the store and then flee the scene.Â  Deputy Christophel pursued the suspect on\r\n  foot while Deputy Livingston attempted to apprehend the suspect by driving\r\n  around the adjacent area.Â  Ultimately, Deputy Christophel apprehended and\r\n  arrested the suspect within a few minutes.Â  According to Deputies Christophel\r\n  and Livingston, the suspect, who was identified as Harris, said â€œYou got me. I\r\n  did it. You got meâ€ as they were arresting him. Â The deputies then transported\r\n  Harris back to the scene where they retrieved the mask that he had discarded as\r\n  he exited the store.Â  At the store, Harris told the officers that the other men\r\n  had absconded in a burgundy-colored Thunderbird and gave the license plate\r\n  number.\r\nThe\r\n  deputies then transported Harris to the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department\r\n  where he was interviewed by Investigators Eric Barnes and Stephen Curtis.Â \r\n  According to Barnes and Curtis, Harris gave an oral statement in which he\r\n  admitted his involvement in the armed robbery but declined to provide\r\n  additional details.Â  Eventually, Harris identified his accomplices as Stuart\r\n  Young and Walter Lewis.Â  The investigators also questioned Brown, Outen, the\r\n  store manager, and the two customers regarding their account of the robbery.\r\n \r\nWith this\r\n  information, the investigators compiled a photographic lineup and presented it to Outen.Â  Outen was able to identify Stuart Young as the robber who did not wear\r\n  a mask.Â  The next day, the investigators arrested Young after they apprehended\r\n  him while he was driving Harrisâ€™s Thunderbird.Â  Young gave a written statement\r\n  to the investigators in which he admitted his involvement in the robbery and\r\n  implicated Harris and Lewis.Â  Lewis, who left the state after the robbery, was\r\n  ultimately taken into custody after he was arrested in Virginia on unrelated\r\n  federal charges.\r\nOn March 15, 1999, Harris\r\n  was tried for armed robbery before Circuit Court Judge John Breeden.Â  Because the\r\n  jury could not reach a verdict, this trial ended in a mistrial. Â Harris was retried\r\n  on March 30, 1999.[1]Â \r\n  At the conclusion of the second trial before Circuit Court Judge James C.\r\n  Williams, Jr., Harris was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life\r\n  imprisonment without parole pursuant to section 17-25-45 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code due to his nine prior convictions for armed robbery.[2]Â \r\n  On direct appeal, this Court affirmed Harrisâ€™s conviction and sentence in State\r\n    v. Harris, Op. No. 2001-MO-021 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Mar. 28, 2001). \r\n \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Harris filed an application for post-conviction relief, alleging he was being\r\n  held unlawfully due to:Â  ineffective assistance of trial counsel; lack of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction; a sentence which violated ex post facto laws; and\r\n  a sentence which violated Article XII, Â§ 2 of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\n \r\nCircuit Court Judge\r\n  G. Thomas Cooper, Jr., held a hearing on Harrisâ€™s petition.Â  At the hearing,\r\n  Harrisâ€™s PCR counsel contended trial counsel was ineffective in that he failed\r\n  to:Â  (1) procure a copy of the trial transcript from Harrisâ€™s first trial or\r\n  move for a continuance until such transcript could be obtained; (2) have Harris\r\n  served with sufficient legal notice of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek LWOP; and\r\n  (3) adequately consult with Harris prior to the two trials.Â  Additionally, PCR\r\n  counsel alleged that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to brief\r\n  Harrisâ€™s motion to relieve trial counsel.Â  In support of these allegations, PCR\r\n  counsel called Harris and his trial counsel, James Mann, as witnesses.\r\nAfter the hearing,\r\n  Judge Cooper issued an order granting Harrisâ€™s application for post-conviction\r\n  relief.Â  In reaching this decision, Judge Cooper found trial counsel was\r\n  ineffective and Harris was prejudiced by counselâ€™s failure to procure a copy of\r\n  the first trial transcript.Â  Because there were â€œobvious inconsistencies in\r\n  crucial testimony,â€ Judge Cooper believed trial counsel should have obtained\r\n  the transcript to prove these â€œsubstantial differences.â€Â  Secondly, Judge\r\n  Cooper found that counselâ€™s pre-trial consultation with Harris was inadequate\r\n  given the State was seeking a sentence of LWOP.Â  Finally, Judge Cooper\r\n  concluded Harrisâ€™s LWOP sentence was void because there was no evidence that\r\n  Harris had been served with written notice of the Stateâ€™s intent to seek a\r\n  sentence of LWOP as mandated by the terms of section 17-25-45(H).\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered\r\n  adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making\r\n  all significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318,\r\n  331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the PCR\r\n  applicant must show that: (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2)\r\n  there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of\r\n  the trial would have been different.Â  Id. (citing Strickland v.\r\n    Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a\r\n  probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.â€Â  Ard,\r\n  372 S.C. at 331, 642 S.E.2d at 596. â€œFurthermore, when a defendantâ€™s conviction\r\n  is challenged, â€˜the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that,\r\n  absent the errors, the fact finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting\r\n  guilt.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 695 (1984)).\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n  365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  A PCR courtâ€™s findings will be upheld on\r\n  appeal if there is â€œany evidence of probative value sufficient to support\r\n  them.â€Â  Id.Â  This Court will reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision when it is\r\n  controlled by an error\r\n  of law.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 651, 594 S.E.2d 462, 465\r\n  (2004).\r\nI.\r\nThe\r\n  State contends the PCR judge erred in finding trial counsel was ineffective in\r\n  failing to consult with Harris prior to both trials.Â  We agree with the Stateâ€™s\r\n  contention.\r\nIn\r\n  granting Harris relief on this ground, the PCR judge found Harrisâ€™s allegations\r\n  that his meetings with counsel were â€œlimited in number and durationâ€ and that\r\n  he never received a copy of the discovery materials were â€œmainly unrefuted by\r\n  trial counsel.â€ Â Specifically, the judge noted that trial counsel did not know\r\n  exactly how many times he had met with Harris to prepare for trial or whether\r\n  he had provided Harris with the discovery materials.Â  The PCR judge also found\r\n  significant the fact that counsel did not produce any time records to document\r\n  his preparation with Harris.Â  The PCR judge stated that â€œ[b]ased upon the lack\r\n  of evidence to the contrary, the Court would have to conclude that trial\r\n  counselâ€™s preparation with his client in a case involving life without parole\r\n  was inadequate and constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.â€  \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Harris testified he met with trial counsel two or three times\r\n  prior to the first trial.Â  He also admitted that trial counsel reviewed the\r\n  discovery materials with him for approximately thirty minutes during his first\r\n  visit. Â Harris, however, stated counsel never gave him a copy of these\r\n  materials.Â  Harris also claimed he did not meet with counsel during the ten\r\n  days between the mistrial and the second trial and he had no opportunity to\r\n  discuss trial strategy with counsel prior to the second trial.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, trial counsel testified he was retained by Harrisâ€™s family and began\r\n  preparing for the case in late December 1998 after he mailed a Rule 5 motion to\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s office.Â  After he received the discovery materials, counsel\r\n  â€œessentially treated [Harrisâ€™s mandatory life case] like . . . the death\r\n  penalty appointments [he] had in the past, which is that [he] just put\r\n  everything else down.â€Â  Counsel could not recall how many times he met with Harris\r\n  prior to the first trial; however, he stated â€œthereâ€™s no question in my mind\r\n  that I had completely mastered the defenseâ€ and â€œwas prepared on what we had to\r\n  do on [Harrisâ€™s] part.â€Â  Counsel also stated that he went over all the\r\n  discovery materials with Harris prior to trial.Â  Although counsel could not\r\n  remember whether he left a copy of the discovery materials with Harris, he\r\n  testified his routine practice was to leave a copy with his client.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  terms of preparation for the second trial, counsel admitted that he did not\r\n  meet with Harris between the two trials.Â  However, he testified he met with the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s office at least three times in an attempt to negotiate a plea\r\n  agreement for Harris.Â  Counsel also stated that he did not try another case in\r\n  between the two trials and believed the facts of the case were fresh on his\r\n  mind during the second trial.Â  He also noted there were no additions to the\r\n  discovery materials between the first and second trials.  \r\nWe\r\n  find the PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion that trial counselâ€™s preparation was inadequate\r\n  is not supported by the evidence in the record.Â  Notably, counsel testified he\r\n  had been practicing law for approximately thirty years and that half of his\r\n  practice involved criminal cases.Â  Presumably, â€œcounsel rendered adequate\r\n  assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all\r\n  significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331,\r\n  642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we believe trial counselâ€™s testimony refutes Harrisâ€™s allegations and directly\r\n  contradicts the PCR judgeâ€™s finding.Â  See Scott v. State,\r\n  334 S.C. 248, 252, 513 S.E.2d 100, 102 (1999) (stating â€œan appellate court will not affirm the\r\n  decision when it is not supported by any probative evidenceâ€).Â  First, there is\r\n  no question that counsel met with Harris on several occasions prior to the\r\n  first trial.Â  Even if the meetings were brief, this fact alone is not\r\n  indicative of inadequate trial preparation.Â  See Easter v. Estelle,\r\n  609 F.2d 756, 759 (5th Cir. 1980) (recognizing that brevity of time spent in\r\n  consultation with defendant, without more, did not establish that trial counsel\r\n  was ineffective).Â   \r\nFurthermore, Harris did not offer any evidence or argument as to\r\n  how counselâ€™s alleged lack of preparation prejudiced him.Â  Therefore, it is\r\n  merely speculative that counselâ€™s alleged deficient performance was prejudicial\r\n  to Harris.Â  See Glover v. State, 318 S.C. 496, 498, 458 S.E.2d\r\n  538, 540 (1995) (noting mere speculation and conjecture on the part of\r\n  Respondent is insufficient to substantiate allegation that counselâ€™s deficient performance\r\n  was prejudicial to respondent).Â   \r\nFinally, the PCR judge failed to make a finding regarding how the\r\n  outcome of the trial would have been different had counsel spent more time with\r\n  Harris or given him a copy of the discovery materials.Â  See Jackson\r\n    v. State, 329 S.C. 345, 353-54, 495 S.E.2d 768, 772 (1998) (finding PCR\r\n  judge erred in finding counsel ineffective in preparing respondentâ€™s case where\r\n  respondent failed to show how his counselâ€™s lack of preparation prejudiced him\r\n  given respondent did not â€œpresent any evidence of what counsel could have\r\n  discovered or what other defenses respondent would have requested counsel\r\n  pursue had counsel more fully prepared for the trialâ€); Davis v. State,\r\n  326 S.C. 283, 288, 486 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1997) (holding record did not support\r\n  PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion that counselâ€™s deficient performance was prejudicial to respondent\r\n  given respondent did not show how additional preparation would have resulted in\r\n  a different outcome); Skeen v. State, 325 S.C. 210, 214, 481 S.E.2d 129,\r\n  132 (1997) (finding applicant was not entitled to post-conviction relief where\r\n  there was no evidence presented at the PCR hearing to show how additional preparation\r\n  would have had any possible effect on the result of the trial). Accordingly, we\r\n  hold the PCR judge erred in finding that counselâ€™s preparation was inadequate\r\n  and constituted a ground for granting Harris post-conviction relief.Â   \r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the PCR judge erred in finding trial counsel was ineffective in\r\n  failing to obtain a transcript from Harrisâ€™s first trial in order to impeach\r\n  witnesses during the second trial.Â  We agree.\r\nBecause\r\n  trial counsel did not obtain the transcript, the PCR judge found counsel could\r\n  not effectively present Harrisâ€™s defense at the second trial.Â  In the judgeâ€™s\r\n  view, having a copy of the first trial transcript was critical to Harrisâ€™s\r\n  defense given: Â the first case ended in a mistrial; there was not overwhelming evidence\r\n  of guilt; and there were discrepancies in several witnessesâ€™ testimonies\r\n  presented at the first and second trials.Â   \r\nFor\r\n  several reasons, we conclude the PCR judge erred in granting Harris relief on\r\n  this ground.Â  As an initial matter, Harris never presented a copy of the\r\n  transcript at the PCR hearing.Â  Although the audiotapes from the first trial\r\n  had been destroyed by the time of the hearing, Harris, on at least two\r\n  occasions, wrote to the Richland County Clerk of Court approximately one month\r\n  after his second trial requesting a transcript from each trial.Â  Additionally, we\r\n  believe Harrisâ€™s PCR counsel, who was appointed within three years of the\r\n  mistrial, could have requested the transcript before the audiotapes were\r\n  destroyed in accordance with the version of Rule 607(i), SCACR, which was in\r\n  effect at the time of the PCR hearing.Â  See Rule 607(i), SCACR (â€œ[A]\r\n  court reporter shall retain the primary and backup tapes of a proceeding for a\r\n  period of at least three years (3) after the date of the proceeding, and the\r\n  court reporter may reuse or destroy the tapes after the expiration of that\r\n  period.â€).[3]Â  Â Â \r\nBecause\r\n  it was incumbent upon Harris to provide the PCR judge with a copy of the\r\n  transcript in order to show that he was prejudiced by its absence at the second\r\n  trial, Harris did not meet his burden to prove that trial counsel was deficient\r\n  and that the result of his trial would have been different but for this alleged\r\n  deficiency.Â  It was merely speculative that the transcript would have aided in\r\n  his defense. Â See Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506, 513, 511 S.E.2d\r\n  62, 66 (1999) (finding that where contents of challenged documents were not\r\n  presented at the PCR hearing, defendant failed to present any evidence of\r\n  probative value demonstrating how counselâ€™s failure to obtain the unproduced\r\n  documents in a more timely fashion prejudiced his defense); cf. Porter\r\n    v. State, 368 S.C. 378, 386, 629 S.E.2d 353, 358 (2006) (â€œMere speculation\r\n  of what a witnessâ€™ testimony may be is insufficient to satisfy the burden of showing\r\n  prejudice in a petition for PCR.â€); Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 369,\r\n  610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005) (â€œA PCR applicant cannot show that he was prejudiced\r\n  by counselâ€™s failure to call a favorable witness to testify at trial if that\r\n  witness does not later testify at the PCR hearing or otherwise offer testimony\r\n  within the rules of evidence.â€).\r\nEven\r\n  if Harris met his burden to show that counsel was deficient in failing to\r\n  obtain the transcript, Harris did not prove this alleged deficiency prejudiced\r\n  his defense.Â  First, trial counsel testified at the PCR hearing that in\r\n  preparing for the second trial he concentrated on the notes he had from every\r\n  witness that testified at the first trial, the notes of his opening statement\r\n  and closing argument, as well as his notes from his cross-examinations. Â Because\r\n  he did not try another case in between Harrisâ€™s two trials, counsel believed\r\n  the events of the first trial were fresh in his mind during the second trial.Â  Additionally,\r\n  counsel explained he did not order the first trial transcript because he did\r\n  not believe having the transcript would be important in terms of\r\n  cross-examining the Stateâ€™s witnesses.  \r\nIn\r\n  terms of specific testimony, counsel believed the only critical difference in\r\n  testimony between the two trials was that of Investigator Barnes.Â  Counsel\r\n  explained that during the first trial, in an in camera hearing, Investigator\r\n  Barnes was uncertain whether Harris admitted his involvement at the time he\r\n  revealed the identities of Young and Lewis.Â  In the second trial, Investigator\r\n  Barnes admitted he made an error in his prior testimony in that he believed\r\n  Harris did in fact admit to his involvement in the robbery.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  conjunction with this testimony, trial counsel also acknowledged there were\r\n  differences in Deputy Livingstonâ€™s testimony during the first and second\r\n  trials.Â  Counsel, however, emphasized that his cross-examination of Deputy\r\n  Livingston pointed out the difference in testimony regarding the statement\r\n  Harris made when he was apprehended by Deputies Livingston and Christophel.Â  In\r\n  the first trial, Deputy Livingston testified that Harris only stated â€œYou got\r\n  me;â€ however, in the second trial, he claimed that Harris stated â€œYou got me.Â \r\n  I did it. You got me.â€Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find the fact that counsel did not obtain a transcript to impeach Livingston and Barnes was inconsequential. Deputy Christophel testified that Harris\r\n  admitted his involvement in the robbery at the time he was apprehended.Â \r\n  Specifically, Deputy Christophel testified that Harris stated, â€œYouâ€™ve got me.Â \r\n  I did it.Â  You got meâ€ at the time he was being handcuffed.Â  Because Deputy\r\n  Christophel was only called as a witness during the second trial, Harrisâ€™s\r\n  counsel could not have impeached him with a prior transcript.Â  Given this\r\n  testimony was essentially the same as that of Deputies Livingston and Barnes, we\r\n  find a copy of the transcript was not critical in presenting Harrisâ€™s defense.\r\nIII.\r\nThe\r\n  State asserts the PCR judge erred in granting relief where Harris was unable to\r\n  show prejudice from counselâ€™s failure to obtain the transcript due to the\r\n  overwhelming evidence supporting Harrisâ€™s guilt.Â  We agree with the Stateâ€™s\r\n  assertion.\r\nThe\r\n  evidence presented at trial established that Deputies Livingston and\r\n  Christophel arrived at the scene of the robbery within less than a minute of\r\n  receiving the 911 dispatch.Â  When they arrived, they observed Harris discard\r\n  his mask and then flee the scene.Â  The deputies were able to apprehend Harris\r\n  within minutes at a nearby location.Â  According to Christophel and Livingston,\r\n  Harris immediately admitted his involvement in the robbery.Â  After being\r\n  transported to the Richland County Sherriffâ€™s Department, Harris again admitted\r\n  his involvement and identified the names of his accomplices.Â  He also informed\r\n  the investigators that these individuals drove away from the scene in his car.Â \r\n  Harris then gave the investigators the license plate number of the vehicle.Â \r\n  Additionally, Stuart Young, one of Harrisâ€™s accomplices, was arrested while\r\n  driving Harrisâ€™s car.Â  Shortly thereafter, Outen selected Young out of a\r\n  photographic lineup as the man who was not wearing a mask during the robbery.Â  In\r\n  his written statement and trial testimony, Young implicated Harris in the armed\r\n  robbery.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find there was overwhelming evidence of Harrisâ€™s guilt.Â \r\n  Therefore, we hold the PCR judge erred in finding counsel was ineffective in\r\n  failing to obtain a transcript of the first trial in order to impeach the\r\n  witnesses.Â  See Franklin v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 563, 570 n.3, 552\r\n  S.E.2d 718, 722 n.3 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1114 (2002) (finding\r\n  overwhelming evidence of guilt negated any claim that counselâ€™s deficient\r\n  performance could have reasonably affected the result of defendantâ€™s trial); Geter\r\n    v. State, 305 S.C. 365, 367, 409 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1991) (concluding reasonable probability of a different\r\n  result does not exist when there is overwhelming evidence of guilt); cf. Ford\r\n    v. State, 314 S.C. 245, 248, 442 S.E.2d 604, 606 (1994)\r\n  (holding respondent failed to prove prejudice from trial counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  request an alibi charge where there was overwhelming evidence of guilt).\r\nIV.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the PCR judge erred in granting a new trial based on the Stateâ€™s\r\n  failure to provide Harris with written notice of its intention to seek a LWOP\r\n  sentence.Â  We agree with the State.\r\nIn\r\n  ruling that Harrisâ€™s sentence was void, the PCR judge relied on the Court of\r\n  Appealsâ€™ decision in State v. Johnson, 347 S.C. 67, 552 S.E.2d 339 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  In Johnson, the Court of Appeals interpreted the\r\n  requirements of imposing a sentence under section 17-25-45.Â  The court found\r\n  that a LWOP sentence could not be imposed unless written notice of intent to\r\n  seek this sentence was given to both the defendant and defense counsel.Â \r\n  Recently, this Court overruled Johnson in James v. State, 372\r\n  S.C. 287, 641 S.E.2d 899 (2007), and held that at least ten daysâ€™ actual notice\r\n  is all that is required to impose a LWOP sentence.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, Harris had at least ten daysâ€™ actual notice of the potential\r\n  LWOP sentence.Â  Prior to his second trial, the trial judge informed Harris that\r\n  he would receive a mandatory LWOP sentence if convicted.Â  Harris acknowledged\r\n  that a LWOP sentence would be imposed.Â  Shortly thereafter, Harris moved to\r\n  have his trial counsel relieved.Â  As the basis for this motion, Harris\r\n  expressed concern with counselâ€™s representation given he was â€œfacing a life\r\n  sentence.â€Â  Additionally, at sentencing the solicitor entered into evidence a\r\n  copy of the Stateâ€™s Notice of Intent to Seek Life without Parole, which had been\r\n  filed on February 26, 1999.Â  The filing of this notice was well in advance of\r\n  Harrisâ€™s two trials, which were conducted on March 15, 1999, and March 30,\r\n  1999.Â  Moreover, at the PCR hearing, trial counsel testified that he had received\r\n  a copy of the Stateâ€™s LWOP notice and that it was part of his file. Â Although\r\n  he did not know for certain whether Harris received a copy of the Stateâ€™s LWOP\r\n  notice, trial counsel testified there was â€œ[n]o question he was informed from\r\n  the get-go that he was facing life imprisonment, mandatory.â€Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find the PCR judge erred in holding Harrisâ€™s LWOP sentence was void. See Sheppard\r\n    v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 651,\r\n  594 S.E.2d 462, 465 (2004) (noting this Court will reverse the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  decision when it is controlled by an error of law); see alsoÂ  Scott v. State,\r\n  334 S.C. 248, 252, 513 S.E.2d 100, 102 (1999) (stating â€œan appellate court will not affirm the\r\n  decision when it is not supported by any probative evidenceâ€); Dempsey\r\n    v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005) (A\r\n  PCR courtâ€™s findings will be upheld on appeal if there is â€œany evidence of\r\n  probative value sufficient to support them.â€).  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn view of the foregoing, we hold the PCR\r\n  judge erred in granting Harrisâ€™s application for post-conviction relief.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the order of the PCR judge.\r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  At the beginning of this trial, Harris moved to have\r\n  his trial counsel relieved.Â  Harris claimed to have â€œconflictsâ€ with counsel\r\n  and was concerned about his representation given he was facing a life sentence. \r\n \r\n[2]Â Â  Section 17-25-45 permits the State to seek a\r\n  sentence of life without the possibility of parole if the person has one or\r\n  more prior convictions for a â€œmost serious offense,â€ which includes the offense\r\n  of armed robbery.Â Â  S.C.

Starr, of Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough, of Myrtle Beach, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This appeal arises out\r\n  of a dispute involving road access to oceanfront property in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina.Â  The crux of this matter is the scope of an easement over a private road implied\r\n  in a deed from Respondent Inlet Harbour, a South Carolina general partnership,\r\n  to the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism.Â  The trial\r\n  court held that the implied easement was limited in scope and the Department of\r\n  Parks, Recreation and Tourism appealed.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nThe\r\n  circumstances giving rise to this case are best explained by way of historical\r\n  narrative.Â  In the early 1970â€™s, a group of investors formed the Inlet Harbour\r\n  general partnership and acquired a large tract of land on the peninsula forming\r\n  the northern border of the entrance to the coastal waterway known as Murrells\r\n  Inlet.Â  The partnership made this acquisition for the purpose of developing\r\n  this area into a residential subdivision.\r\nAt\r\n  the time the partnership purchased this land, it was aware that the United\r\n  States Army Corps of Engineers was preparing a substantial engineering project\r\n  to solve navigability problems in the Murrells Inlet waterway.Â  This project,\r\n  referred to as the â€œMurrells Inlet Navigability Project,â€ called for the\r\n  construction of jetties at the north and south entrances to the inlet and for\r\n  routine dredging of the inlet.Â  The project was to be funded with both state\r\n  and federal resources, and the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation\r\n  and Tourism (â€œthe Departmentâ€) was charged with acquiring the land necessary\r\n  for the project.Â  The Department was to acquire the necessary property and\r\n  transfer that property to the Corps of Engineers.\r\nThe\r\n  land at issue in this case was acquired for the construction and maintenance of\r\n  the jetty at the inletâ€™s north entrance.Â  Inlet Harbour sold a first parcel of\r\n  land to the Department in March 1976.Â  This rather large tract (approximately\r\n  4.2 acres) was located very near the end of the peninsula.Â  The tract bordered\r\n  the ocean on the east and undeveloped property on the west and south.Â  Undeveloped\r\n  residential lots bordered the tract on the north, and Inlet Harbour Drive - the\r\n  yet-to-be-developed thoroughfare through the development - abutted portions of\r\n  the tractâ€™s north and west borders.Â  In addition to describing the property by\r\n  metes and bounds, the deed to the Department referenced a plat recorded roughly\r\n  two weeks earlier.Â  This plat showed the 4.2-acre tract, the adjacent undeveloped\r\n  lots, and the future site of Inlet Harbour Drive.Â  The deed to the Department\r\n  additionally contained an express easement to use Inlet Harbour Drive to access\r\n  the property â€œfor the sole purpose of constructing and maintaining the north\r\n  sand dike and jetty for the Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, Navigation\r\n  Project.â€\r\nSome\r\n  time after this transfer, the Corps of Engineers directed the Department to\r\n  acquire a second tract of land from Inlet Harbour.Â  The Corps required this\r\n  second purchase in the event that it proved necessary to construct a â€œdeflector\r\n  dikeâ€ to maintain the project.Â  The Department believed this second acquisition\r\n  to be unnecessary, but nevertheless acquired this smaller tract of\r\n  approximately 3.56 acres located immediately to the south of the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  larger tract.Â  The parties completed this transaction in July 1977.Â  Like the\r\n  initial land sale, this deed described the conveyed property by reference to a\r\n  plat.Â  Unlike the initial sale, however, this deed did not contain any easement\r\n  over or reference to Inlet Harbour Drive.Â  After this second transaction, the\r\n  Department owned contiguous tracts which comprised the south and southeast\r\n  corners of the north Murrells Inlet peninsula.\r\nThe\r\n  Department transferred the 4.2-acre tract of property to the Corps of Engineers\r\n  roughly one month after acquiring the 3.56-acre tract.Â  Because the Department\r\n  felt that the acquisition of the second tract was unnecessary, the Department\r\n  leased the 3.56-acre tract to the Corps instead of transferring title to the\r\n  Corps.Â  Although the transfer of the 4.2-acre tract had the effect of cutting\r\n  the 3.56-acre tract off from road access, it appears that the Corps and the\r\n  Department continued to access the 3.56-acre tract, albeit very infrequently,\r\n  by using Inlet Harbour Drive and then traversing the 4.2-acre tract.Â  The\r\n  Departmentâ€™s lease with the Corps expired in the mid-1990â€™s, and the Corps\r\n  determined that it would not need to construct a deflector dike in order to\r\n  maintain the Navigability Project.Â  The Department then began investigating the\r\n  subdivision and sale of the 3.56-acre tract, and this litigation followed.\r\nThe Inlet Harbour partnership initiated this declaratory judgment action against the Department\r\n  requesting that the court declare the scope of the Departmentâ€™s right to use Inlet Harbour Drive to access the 3.56-acre tract.Â  The Department asserted the creation of\r\n  an express easement and an easement implied by necessity as counterclaims, and\r\n  the Department sought to add Respondent Inlet Harbour Property Owners\r\n  Association as a third-party defendant.[1]Â \r\n  Although the property owners association answered that it had assigned all of\r\n  its rights in this litigation to the partnership, there appears to be no\r\n  continuing dispute involving the property owners associationâ€™s inclusion as a\r\n  party in this case.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court entered a grant of partial summary judgment to the Department.Â \r\n  Relying on the authority of Blue Ridge Realty Company v. Williamson, 247\r\n  S.C. 112, 145 S.E.2d 922 (1965), the trial court held that the Department had\r\n  an easement for ingress and egress over Inlet Harbour Drive which arose out of\r\n  the reference in the Departmentâ€™s deed to a plat depicting subdivided lots and\r\n  streets.Â  Although the trial court held that there was no doubt as to the\r\n  existence of this easement, the court held that there was a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact as to whether the scope of the Departmentâ€™s easement was\r\n  unrestricted or was restricted to purposes relating to the Murrells Inlet\r\n  Navigability Project.Â  The parties proceeded to trial, and at the conclusion of\r\n  the trial, the court held that the Departmentâ€™s easement over Inlet Harbour Drive was limited to environmental purposes associated with maintaining the\r\n  navigability of Murrells Inlet.Â  The Department appealed.\r\nThis\r\n  Court certified the appeal from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR.Â  The Department raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  trial court err in holding that the Departmentâ€™s easement to use Inlet Harbour Drive is limited to environmental purposes associated with maintaining the\r\n  navigability of Murrells Inlet?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThe\r\n  determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law\r\n  action, Jowers v. Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 551, 357 S.E.2d 710, 711\r\n  (1987), and this Court reviews factual issues relating to the existence of an\r\n  easement under a highly deferential standard.Â  See Townes Associates, Ltd.\r\n    v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85-86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976)\r\n  (providing that questions of fact in a law action are generally reviewed under\r\n  the â€œany evidenceâ€ standard).Â   \r\nApart\r\n  from the issue of an easementâ€™s creation, however, the determination of the\r\n  scope of an easement is an action in equity.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997).Â  In an action at equity,\r\n  tried by a judge alone, an appellate court may find facts in accordance with\r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes, 266 S.C. at\r\n  86, 221 S.E.2d at 775.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe\r\n  Department argues that the trial court erred in holding that the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  easement over Inlet Harbour Drive is limited to environmental purposes\r\n  associated with maintaining the navigability of Murrells Inlet.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn\r\n  easement is a right of use over anotherâ€™s property.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 457 (5th ed. 1979).Â  Easements can arise\r\n  by both express creation and by implication.Â  Implied easements are based upon\r\n  the theory that whenever one conveys property, he intends to convey whatever is\r\n  necessary for the propertyâ€™s use and enjoyment.Â  17A Am. Jur. Easements Â§ 37 (1957).Â  The purpose of an implied easement is to give effect to the\r\n  intentions of the parties to a transaction, and because the implication of an\r\n  easement in a conveyance goes against the general rule that a written\r\n  instrument speaks for itself, implied easements are not favored.Â  Id.; see also 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 61 (1996).\r\nThe\r\n  creation of an implied easement generally requires that the facts and\r\n  circumstances surrounding the conveyance, the property, the parties, or some\r\n  other characteristic demonstrate that the objective intention of the parties\r\n  was to create an easement.Â  25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 19\r\n  (2004); 28A C.J.S. Â§ 62.Â  Courts have, over time, developed various\r\n  presumptions regarding the creation of implied easements in certain circumstances.\r\n  Â One such presumption arises when an owner subdivides his land and has the land\r\n  platted into lots and streets.Â  This Court has recognized the general rule that\r\n  when an owner conveys subdivided lots and references the plat in the deed, the\r\n  owner grants the lot owners an easement over the streets appearing in the\r\n  plat.Â  See, e.g., Blue Ridge Realty Co., 247 S.C. at 118, 145 S.E.2d at\r\n  924-25.[2]\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the Department argues that the scope of their easement over Inlet Harbour Drive, implied by the Blue Ridge rule, should extend to using Inlet Harbour Drive for residential purposes.Â  The Department first argues that because the\r\n  rule enunciated in Blue Ridge commonly arises when a landowner has\r\n  platted land into a residential subdivision, the rule presumptively creates an\r\n  easement to use the platted roads for residential purposes.Â  The Department\r\n  further argues that the circumstances surrounding this transaction demonstrate\r\n  that the parties did not intend that the 3.56-acre tract be forever limited to environmental\r\n  purposes associated with maintaining the navigability of Murrells Inlet.Â  In\r\n  our view, both arguments miss the mark.\r\nAs a\r\n  starting point, we note that the intentions of the parties to the transaction\r\n  are the overriding focus when examining implied easements.Â  McAllister v.\r\n    Smiley, 301 S.C. 10, 16, 389 S.E.2d 857, 862 (1990) (Toal, J. dissenting); 28A\r\n  C.J.S. Â§Â§ 82, 149; 17A Am. Jur. Â§Â§ 40, 116; 25 Am. Jur. 2d Â§ 19.Â  Thus, the\r\n  Department over-reads Blue Ridge considerably in suggesting that\r\n  the case stands for the proposition that an easement created by reference to a\r\n  plat is presumptively an easement of a particular scope.Â  The rule applied in Blue Ridge is nothing more than a presumption that when a grantor conveys property\r\n  with reference to a plat showing streets or other ways of passage, the grantor\r\n  intends to allow the grantee the use of the delineated streets and ways of\r\n  passage.Â  McAllister, 301 S.C. at 11-12, 389 S.E.2d at 858. Â The case Cason\r\n    v. Gibson, 217 S.C. 500, 61 S.E.2d 58 (1950), explained the policy\r\n  underlying this presumption in terms of estoppel.Â  In that case, this Court\r\n  explained that when a grantor conveys land abutting a street, he is estopped\r\n  from denying the streetâ€™s existence and the right of the grantee to its use. Id. at 507, 61 S.E.2d at 61. Â This approach is reasonable, and it is\r\n  also reasonable that when an owner conveys property that has been subdivided\r\n  for residential purposes, the grantor presumably intends for grantees to have\r\n  access to the abutting subdivision streets for normal residential purposes.Â \r\n  But the property at issue here is not subdivided residential property and abuts\r\n  no road. Â This demonstrates the problems that might occur if we were to apply a\r\n  rigid presumption based solely upon particular geography or land division.Â  Our\r\n  guidepost must be what the parties intended, and the best evidence of the\r\n  partiesâ€™ intentions are the facts and circumstances surrounding the\r\n  conveyance.Â  See McAllister, 301 S.C. 12, 389 S.E.2d at 858-59; 28A\r\n  C.J.S. Â§Â§ 82, 149; 25 Am. Jur. 2d Â§Â§ 19, 21.Â  Thus, to the extent the\r\n  Department urges this Court to ignore everything except the deedâ€™s reference to\r\n  a residential subdivision plat, this argument fails to remain true to the\r\n  principles underlying implied easements.\r\nOur\r\n  analysis accordingly turns to an examination of the facts and circumstances\r\n  surrounding the sale of the 3.56-acre tract.Â  The Department argues that the\r\n  partnership foresaw the likelihood that the 3.56-acre tract could one day be\r\n  developed for residential purposes and that this is evidenced by the fact that both\r\n  the 4.2-acre and the 3.56-acre tracts were carved out of an end of the\r\n  peninsula labeled â€œreserved for future developmentâ€ on one of the partnershipâ€™s\r\n  maps.Â  The Department further argues that this evidence is supported by the\r\n  testimony of a principal of the partnership providing that the partnership\r\n  would have developed this land for residential purposes if it had not sold the\r\n  land to the Department.Â  According to the Department, this evidence supports\r\n  the proposition that the partnership intended for this tract to be used both\r\n  for purposes associated with maintaining the navigability of Murrells Inlet and\r\n  for residential purposes.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  believe the trial court wisely discounted these arguments.Â  Relying on testimony\r\n  and evidence in the record, the court below took the view that the Inlet Harbour partnership purchased the land it sought to develop with the express\r\n  understanding that portions of the land on the peninsula would need to be\r\n  conveyed to the government for the specific purpose of the Murrells Inlet\r\n  Navigability Project.Â  This view was supported by testimony from the\r\n  partnership that it engaged in several discussions with the state and federal\r\n  entities involved and that the partnership designed the residential subdivision\r\n  and Inlet Harbour Drive around the land that the project would demand.Â  A\r\n  principal of the partnership further testified that the designation of the\r\n  areas acquired by the Department as â€œreserved for future developmentâ€\r\n  specifically meant that the land was reserved for sale to the Corps of\r\n  Engineers for the project.Â   \r\nA\r\n  clarifying point is instructive.Â  A great deal of the evidence surrounding this\r\n  transaction does not focus directly on the issue of access to these tracts of\r\n  land, but pertains instead to how the parties intended for this land to be\r\n  used.Â  Addressing the question of how this land may be used, the Department\r\n  focuses on the lack of any restrictive covenants in the deed to the 3.56-acre\r\n  tract and argues that it should not be prohibited from developing the property\r\n  where the deed contains no restriction prohibiting such development.Â  But the\r\n  absence of restrictions in the Departmentâ€™s deed is not terribly relevant, and\r\n  it is at this point that we must recognize an important distinction regarding\r\n  what is and what is not at issue in this appeal.Â  The question presented in\r\n  this case is the scope of the Departmentâ€™s right to access the 3.56-acre tract\r\n  through a specific route, not a limitation of the Departmentâ€™s right to use\r\n  that tract.Â  The Department unquestionably has the same right to make use of\r\n  its land as does any landowner. Â The concepts of deed warranties and\r\n  restrictive covenants are thus largely irrelevant in this case.\r\nThis\r\n  does not mean, however, that we should disregard the evidence of how the\r\n  parties intended these tracts to be used as irrelevant to the issue of how the\r\n  parties intended to treat access to these tracts. Â We do not think that the subjects\r\n  can be completely separated.Â  If the partnership designed its subdivision\r\n  around the land that it knew the government would require and intended for this\r\n  land to only be used for purposes related to the Murrells Inlet Navigability\r\n  Project, that supports the proposition that the partnership intended for Inlet\r\n  Harbour Drive to provide only a limited right of access to these tracts.Â  Stated\r\n  differently, the fact that the partnership contemplated a specific and limited\r\n  use of this property is evidence that the partnership contemplated a specific\r\n  and limited use of Inlet Harbour Drive to access the property.Â  That this\r\n  limited right of access would be the only right of access over Inlet Harbour\r\n  Drive is further supported by the fact that the partnership initially attempted\r\n  to insert a clause in the deed to the 4.2-acre tract that would have caused\r\n  ownership of the tract to revert to the partnership if the property ceased to\r\n  be used for the jetty project.Â  The Department advised that a reverter would\r\n  not comply with its responsibility under the project to acquire full title, and\r\n  the parties thus crafted the express but limited easement found in the deed to\r\n  the 4.2-acre tract.Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  Department does not point us to any evidence demonstrating that the parties contemplated\r\n  a broader use of Inlet Harbour Drive or intended for this land to one day be\r\n  used for purposes unrelated to the Murrells Inlet Navigability Project.Â  Indeed,\r\n  the Department did not even offer testimony that it contemplated residential development\r\n  of the 3.56-acre tract at the time of purchase. Â While we can say that the\r\n  Department is correct in that its failure to secure utility easements or an\r\n  easement across the 4.2-acre tract does not conclusively prove that later\r\n  development was not contemplated at the time the partnership sold the 3.56-acre\r\n  tract to the Department, the acquisition of such easements would make the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s claim considerably stronger.[3]Â \r\n  The Department could have similarly bolstered its case through bargaining\r\n  expressly for an unrestricted easement over Inlet Harbour Drive at the time it\r\n  purchased the 3.56-acre tract from the partnership.Â  Having not done so, the\r\n  Court is left to discern how the parties intended to treat access to this\r\n  property.Â  Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court erred\r\n  in considering the failure to bargain for express utility and access easements\r\n  in an effort to ascertain the partiesâ€™ intentions.\r\nThe\r\n  Departmentâ€™s strongest argument for reversal is one based largely on equity.Â \r\n  The argument goes that because Inlet Harbour subdivision is a residential\r\n  subdivision, there is no additional servitude imposed on Inlet Harbour Drive by\r\n  allowing the Department to use the road for residential purposes.Â  The\r\n  Department bolsters this argument with the assertion that due to the propertyâ€™s\r\n  oceanfront location, the propertyâ€™s value will be quite large if road access is\r\n  granted and quite small if road access is denied.Â  The Department argues that\r\n  the fact that it leased the land to the Corps of Engineers instead of selling\r\n  the land evidences the Departmentâ€™s intention to sell the property if it was\r\n  not needed for the project.\r\nBut\r\n  the equities in this case do not cut solely in the Departmentâ€™s favor.Â  Absent\r\n  an easement or a license, a landowner generally enjoys no right to use the land\r\n  of another.Â  Implied easements ask the court to take a deed between grantor and\r\n  grantee which is silent regarding any grant or reservation of a right to cross\r\n  one partyâ€™s land to access the otherâ€™s and imply what the parties must have\r\n  meant to include in the deed but did not.Â  In this case, this Court is charged\r\n  with determining what the partnership and the Department meant to include in\r\n  the deed regarding the Departmentâ€™s ability to use Inlet Harbour Drive to\r\n  access the 3.56-acre tract. Â We find that there is simply very little support\r\n  for the proposition that the circumstances surrounding this transaction\r\n  evidence any intent by the parties that an easement over Inlet Harbour Drive\r\n  extend beyond uses relating to the Murrells Inlet Navigability Project.Â  The\r\n  trial court viewed the evidence and determined that the parties intended for\r\n  the limited access appearing in the deed to the 4.2-acre tract to serve both\r\n  parcels, and we agree with the trial courtâ€™s determination.\r\nTwo\r\n  final points are instructive.Â  First, although the Departmentâ€™s argument about\r\n  retaining the 3.56-acre tract instead of transferring the tract to the Corps of\r\n  Engineers is arguably evidence that the Department contemplated someday selling\r\n  the 3.56-acre property at the time it conveyed the 4.2-acre tract to the Corps,\r\n  there is no evidence that Inlet Harbour partnership participated in this\r\n  decision or was even aware of it.Â  Similarly, the Departmentâ€™s argument based\r\n  on having paid fair market value for the 3.56-acre tract is unpersuasive.Â  The\r\n  Department paid fair market value for the 4.2-acre tract despite the grant of a\r\n  limited easement to access that tract, and the record contains testimony that\r\n  the Department was statutorily required to purchase these tracts for fair\r\n  market value.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we hold that the trial court properly concluded that the parties to this\r\n  transaction did not intend for this land to be accessed by Inlet Harbour Drive\r\n  for purposes unrelated to the Murrells Inlet Navigability Project.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision that the Department of Parks,\r\n  Recreation and Tourismâ€™s easement over Inlet Harbour Drive is limited to\r\n  environmental purposes associated with maintaining the navigability of Murrells\r\n  Inlet.[4]\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\nMOORE, WALLER,\r\n  JJ., and Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent, and would hold the circuit\r\n  court erred in limiting the scope of the Department of Parks, Recreation and\r\n  Tourismâ€™s (PRTâ€™s) easement over Inlet Harbour Drive.\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  finding of an implied easement has not been appealed and is therefore the law\r\n  of the case.Â  E.g. Dreher v. Dreher, 370 S.C. 75, 634 S.E.2d 646\r\n  (2006).Â  The sole issue is whether the court erred in limiting the PRTâ€™s road\r\n  easement as it relates to the second tract it purchased from respondent to\r\n  â€œenvironmental purposes associated with maintaining the navigability of\r\n  Murrells Inlet.â€Â  The majority and I agree on the applicable legal principles,\r\n  but I draw a different conclusion about the partiesâ€™ intentions after examining\r\n  the facts and circumstances surrounding the conveyance of the 3.56 acre tract.\r\n \r\nIn\r\n  1976, PRT bought a 4.2 acre tract from respondent at the behest of the Army\r\n  Corps of Engineers.Â  This 1976 deed contained an express easement limiting\r\n  PRTâ€™s right to ingress and egress over Inlet Harbour Drive to â€œthe sole purpose\r\n  of constructing and maintaining the north sand dike and jetty for the Murrells\r\n  Inlet, South Carolina, Navigation Project.â€Â  More than a year later, PRT\r\n  purchased the 3.56 tract at the insistence of the Corps.Â  Among the facts and\r\n  circumstances surrounding this second transaction was PRTâ€™s belief, ultimately\r\n  vindicated, that this tract would not be necessary for the Corpsâ€™ Murrells\r\n  Inlet project.Â  Accordingly, there was a need to preserve this tractâ€™s\r\n  commercial viability.Â  Even more critically in my opinion, the 1977 deed to the\r\n  3.56 acres contains no express easement, much less one limiting PRTâ€™s access to\r\n  Inlet Harbour Drive, as had the March 1976 deed to the 4.2 acre tract.Â  As I\r\n  view the facts and circumstances surrounding the second conveyance, I can draw\r\n  only one conclusion:Â  that the parties did not intend any restriction upon the\r\n  scope of PRTâ€™s Inlet Harbour Drive easement as it relates to the 3.56 acre\r\n  tract.\r\nAccordingly, I\r\n  would reverse.\r\n\r\n[1] In the interim period between the Departmentâ€™s transfer of the 4.2-acre tract\r\n  to the Corps and the expiration of the lease, the Inlet Harbour partnership\r\n  transferred ownership of Inlet Harbour Drive to the Inlet Harbour Property\r\n  Owners Association.\r\n[2] Other examples of these presumptions are easements implied where the grantor used\r\n  one portion of property to serve another prior to severance (easements implied\r\n  by prior use), and easements implied where an easement is necessary to allow a\r\n  grantee to have meaningful access to his land (easements implied by\r\n  necessity).Â  See Boyd v. Bell South Tel. Tel. Co., Inc., 369 S.C. 410,\r\n  633 S.E.2d 136 (2006) (extensively discussing implied easements).\r\n[3] The Department eventually acquired an easement across the 4.2-acre tract, but\r\n  that acquisition did not occur until 1996.Â   \r\n[4] We note that access to the property over navigable water has not been addressed\r\n  at any point in this case.Â  We therefore assume that the property is accessible\r\n  over navigable water.Â  See 25 Am. Jur. 2d Â§ 38 (providing that an\r\n  easement by necessity will generally not be implied where property is\r\n  accessible by navigable water); 28A C.J.S. Â§ 98 (same).

No. 4 at 50) [hereinafter Layman II].Â \r\n  Beginning with a lodestar calculation based on the timesheets in the record\r\n  before this Court and on counselâ€™s hourly rates, this Court enhanced the lodestar\r\n  figure with a multiplier to reflect the exceptional circumstances of the case, and\r\n  modified the circuit judgeâ€™s calculation of attorneysâ€™ fees to award counsel\r\n  for the TERI plaintiffs $445,226.60.Â  Id. at 73. \r\nCounsel for the TERI plaintiffs filed a petition\r\n  for rehearing, and in their return, the State and the Retirement System moved\r\n  for leave to supplement the record.Â  We deny the motions of both parties and\r\n  issue this order modifying the award of attorneysâ€™ fees to reflect the\r\n  additional fees and costs incurred by counsel for the TERI plaintiffs in\r\n  litigating the issue of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  In doing so, we note that counsel for\r\n  the TERI plaintiffs did not set forth these additional fees and costs in the\r\n  record before this Court in Layman II even though counsel were\r\n  presumably aware that the Stateâ€™s and the Retirement Systemâ€™s theory of the\r\n  case was that under the relevant statute, attorneysâ€™ fees were to be awarded\r\n  based solely on counselâ€™s hourly rate and time expended.Â  While the matter\r\n  could be remanded at this juncture for a calculation of attorneysâ€™ fees in\r\n  accordance with the methodology outlined in Layman II, in the interest\r\n  of fairness and in ending this litigation without further accrual of fees by\r\n  either side, we modify our original award of attorneysâ€™ fees to include this\r\n  additional time expended by counsel.\r\nThe revised award of attorneysâ€™ fees is itemized as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Total Hours Expended\r\n    Net Hours Expended\r\n    Hourly Rate\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Totals\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Courtâ€™s original\r\n      lodestar calculation \r\n\t(hours expended before\r\n          June 1, 2006)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Lewis &amp; Babcock\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.

LeafGuard USA, Inc., 365 S.C. 565, 619 S.E.2d 12 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals affirmed the partial grant of summary judgment to\r\n  Respondent, Englert, Inc., finding Englert was entitled to possession of a\r\n  gutter-fabricating machine which was in the possession of Petitioner, LeafGuard\r\n  USA, Inc.Â  We reverse the grant of summary judgment.\r\nFACTS\r\nJerry\r\n  Dan Vickory is the owner of two companies which manufacture and install\r\n  gutters: LeafGuard USA and Seamless Gutters of Socastee.Â  In 1993, Vickory, on\r\n  behalf of Seamless Gutters, entered into a Sub-License Agreement with Englert,\r\n  Inc., a distributor of seamless gutter machines and raw materials used in\r\n  manufacturing seamless gutters.Â  Pursuant to the agreement, Seamless Gutters\r\n  was granted the right to manufacture, sell, and install Englertâ€™s product, the\r\n  LeafGuard Gutter System, in a set sales territory.Â  The agreement set forth\r\n  minimum sales quotas and required Seamless Gutters to pay Englert royalties.Â  The\r\n  agreement required Seamless Gutters to purchase a $26,000 gutter-fabricating\r\n  machine to produce the Englert Gutter System.Â Â  The contract includes the\r\n  following buy-back provision:\r\n\r\n\tUpon termination of this Agreement, Englert shall purchase, and\r\n  Sub-Licensee shall sell, the Englert LeafGuard Gutter Machine, subject to\r\n  normal wear and tear and pay Sub-Licensee at a price equal to the greater of:\r\n\t(i) the depreciated value of the Englert LeafGuard Gutter Machine,\r\n  based on a depreciated rate of 20% per year on the original price; or\r\n\t(ii) $1.00\r\n\r\nIn 1998, LeafGuard USA entered into a SubLicense Agreement with\r\n  Englert which was substantially similar to the 1993 agreement between Englert\r\n  and Seamless Gutters.Â  As with the prior agreement, LeafGuard USA had minimum sales quotas (15,000 feet of gutters per year), and was required to pay\r\n  royalties.Â  Although the 1998 contract required LeafGuard USA to purchase an Englert LeafGuard Gutter Machine for $28,000.00, it is undisputed that\r\n  LeafGuard USA simply took possession of and utilized the LeafGuard Gutter\r\n  Machine purchased by Seamless Gutters in 1993.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  1998 agreement contains the same buy-back provision, allowing Englert to repurchase\r\n  the LeafGuard Gutter Machine for $1.00 after full depreciation.Â  The 1998\r\n  agreement was for an initial two year term from Jan. 1, 1999- Dec. 31, 2000 and\r\n  provided that it would continue for additional one year periods thereafter, â€œif\r\n  Licensee has materially complied with all of the provisions of this License.â€Â \r\n  However, the agreement provided that if the licensee breached any provision or\r\n  remained in default for a period of thirty days after written notice from\r\n  Englert (or 10 days written notice in the event of failure to pay royalties),\r\n  Englert had the right to cancel the agreement and terminate the license\r\n  immediately.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  March 15, 2001, Englert sent LeafGuard USA a letter advising that after\r\n  numerous attempts at trying to contact LeafGuard USA, it was terminating the Sub-Licensing\r\n  Agreement for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\t-Â Â Failure to meet the established sales target amount\r\n  agreed as stated in the Sub-License Agreement under section 5C.\r\n\t-Â Â As stated in the Sub-License Agreement under Section 6E,\r\n  should Sub-Licensee be in default on its payment obligations to Englert for 60\r\n  days, Englert may, at its option, terminate this License Agreement and/or seek\r\n  any other options open to Englert, taking over the repossessing SubLicenseeâ€™s\r\n  Englert LeafGuard Gutter Machine and/or rescinding Sub-Licensee from further\r\n  manufacturing and distributing of Englert LeafGuard, and initiating the\r\n  collection of the amounts owed to Englert.\r\n\r\nThe letter went\r\n  on to advise that LeafGuard USA was 11,060 feet short of its 2000 sales quota,\r\n  and that it was over 60 days past due in payment of royalties.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  Englert advised LeafGuard USA that it was to terminate all use of Englertâ€™s\r\n  trademarks, and was to make arrangements for the immediate return of the gutter\r\n  machine, at its expense, for which it would be paid $1.00 for the machine, in\r\n  accordance with the licensing agreement.Â Â   \r\nLeafGuard\r\n  USA did not return the machine and on July 30, 2001, Englert filed a Claim\r\n  and Delivery action.Â  One year later, on June 17, 2002, Judge Breeden denied\r\n  Englertâ€™s motion for immediate possession of the gutter machine.Â  Englert filed\r\n  an amended complaint in March 2003 seeking an injunction and other relief.Â \r\n  LeafGuard USA answered and alleged the affirmative defenses of waiver,\r\n  estoppel, laches, unclean hands, fraud and bad faith (among other defenses).Â \r\n  LeafGuard USA also filed a counterclaim, alleging unfair and deceptive trade\r\n  practices, breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent\r\n  act, and fraud.Â   \r\nAfter a\r\n  hearing, Judge Harwell granted Englertâ€™s motion for partial summary judgment,\r\n  essentially holding that since the partiesâ€™ contract was terminated, Englert\r\n  had an absolute right to repossess the machine.Â  Judge Harwell also found that\r\n  LeafGuard USAâ€™s counterclaims did not preclude summary judgment.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed.Â  Englert, Inc. v. LeafGuard USA, Inc., 365 S.C. 565,\r\n  619 S.E.2d 12 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The Court of Appeals addressed only LeafGuard\r\n  USAâ€™s primary issue, in which it asserted summary judgment could not be granted\r\n  to Englert because the machine had actually been sold to Seamless Gutters, such\r\n  that the court could not order a transfer of ownership from a non-party.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals ruled that the two companies were in reality the same company,\r\n  such that the grant of summary judgment was proper.Â  The Court of Appeals did\r\n  not address whether LeafGuard USAâ€™s counterclaims and affirmative defenses were\r\n  sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the trial court err in granting summary judgment where\r\n  LeafGuard USAâ€™s defenses and counterclaims had not been ruled on?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Hansson\r\n    v. Scalise Builders of South Carolina, 374 S.C. 352, 650 S.E.2d 658 (2007); David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3\r\n  (2006).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions,\r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\n  affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\n  and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  When determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the non-moving party. David, 367 S.C. at 247, 626 S.E.2d at\r\n  3.Â  Moreover, since it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be\r\n  cautiously invoked so that a litigant will not be improperly deprived of a trial\r\n  on disputed factual issues.Â  Connor v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C.\r\n  454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002).Â  â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite\r\n  the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€ George\r\n    v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). Summary judgment\r\n  is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is\r\n  desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Baugus v. Wessinger, 303\r\n  S.C. 412, 401 S.E.2d 169 (1991).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nLeafGuard\r\n  USA contends there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the\r\n  contract was properly terminated by Englert, thereby precluding the entry of\r\n  summary judgment.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nLeafGuard\r\n  USA submitted the affidavit of its owner, Jerry Vickory, in opposition to\r\n  Englertâ€™s motion for summary judgment.[1]Â \r\n  In the affidavit, Vickory contends Englert was upset with LeafGuard USA for having developed its own website to market LeafGuard products, and that for complaining\r\n  about Englert infringing on its LeafGuard USA trademark.Â  Vickoryâ€™s affidavit\r\n  asserts that Englert representatives told him, and his wife, that they would\r\n  â€œget us and take away our franchise.â€Â  Vickory also contends that prior to\r\n  Englertâ€™s discovery of the website, he had heard nothing about failing to meet\r\n  sales quotas or unpaid royalties and had, in fact, been recently commended on\r\n  his sales.[2]Â \r\n  Vickory asserted that throughout his course of dealing with Englert, if there\r\n  was ever any issue as to minimum footage in a given year, LeafGuard USA was permitted to purchase extra rolls to make up the difference.Â \r\n \r\nWe find\r\n  the information contained in Vickoryâ€™s affidavit, along with its counterclaims,\r\n  and affirmative defenses, are sufficient to create genuine issues of material\r\n  fact as to whether or not Englert properly terminated the contract.Â \r\n  Accordingly, under the facts presented, we find the trial court erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment in favor of Englert.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion\r\n  affirming the grant of summary judgment is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Michelle Childs, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Englert asserts the affidavit was untimely, as\r\n  it was not filed until after the hearing on the motion for summary judgment.Â \r\n  However, it is undisputed that the affidavit was filed prior to the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling, and there being no indication in the record that the trial\r\n  court did not consider the affidavit, we must assume it was considered.Â  Cf. Smith v. Hastie, 367 S.C. 410, 626 S.E.2d 13 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (recognizing that it is within a trial judgeâ€™s discretion to accept late\r\n  affidavits in opposition to a motion for summary judgment).Â   \r\n[2]Â  In fact, a letter dated Dec. 15,\r\n  2000, from Englert to LeafGuard USA states â€œGood job.Â  Keep selling.â€Â   \r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26461","title":"Brenco v.

S.C. Dept. of Transp., 363 S.C. 136, 609 S.E.2d 531 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We\r\n  granted petitionerâ€™s request for certiorari review and now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  owns property located along Highway 501 in Horry County.Â  The property formerly\r\n  served as the location of a Brendleâ€™s store.Â  In 1998, respondent sold to\r\n  petitioner, in lieu of condemnation, a small portion of respondentâ€™s parking\r\n  lot in order to build a frontage road as part of an ongoing plan to renovate\r\n  and widen Highway 501.Â  The negotiations before execution of the deed and the deed\r\n  itself referenced aspects of petitionerâ€™s 1993 plans for the Highway 501\r\n  project. Â As a result of this conveyance, respondent lost direct access to\r\n  Highway 501 but retained ingress and egress to the frontage road.\r\nThe final project\r\n  was completed pursuant to updated plans drafted by petitioner in 2000- not the\r\n  1993 plans referenced in the deed.Â  As part of the change in plans, petitioner also\r\n  elevated Highway 501 twenty-five feet[1] and reconfigured exit ramps in close proximity to respondentâ€™s property in both\r\n  the eastbound and westbound directions on Highway 501.Â   \r\nAt trial, the main\r\n  thrust of respondentâ€™s case centered on its cause of action for rescission of\r\n  the deed.Â  Specifically, respondent alleged petitioner had not been forthcoming\r\n  during negotiations, and respondent claimed it did not know it would lose\r\n  direct access to Highway 501.Â  Respondent also argued that petitioner knew the\r\n  grade of Highway 501 would eventually be elevated but did not disclose that\r\n  information to respondent before delivery of the deed.Â  Respondentâ€™s witnesses who\r\n  testified as to damages focused on a comparison of the values of the entire\r\n  property before the 1998 conveyance and the property after Highway 501 was\r\n  completed pursuant to the 2000 plans.Â   \r\nAfter ruling on the\r\n  deed issues, the master advised the parties he was struggling with the issue of\r\n  damages relating to the inverse condemnation claim.Â  Respondent thereafter\r\n  moved to reopen the case for the taking of additional testimony as to potential\r\n  damages stemming from inverse condemnation.Â  The master denied respondentâ€™s\r\n  motion to reopen the case and found in favor of petitioner on the inverse\r\n  condemnation cause of action.Â   \r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in finding the master-in-equity abused his discretion\r\n  by refusing to reopen the case for additional evidence regarding respondentâ€™s\r\n  purported damages due to inverse condemnation?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  decision whether to reopen a record for additional evidence is within the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  that discretion.Â  Wright v. Strickland, 306 S.C. 187, 188, 410 S.E.2d\r\n  596, 597 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  The trial judge is endowed with considerable\r\n  latitude and discretion in allowing a party to reopen a case.Â  Spinx Oil\r\n    Co., Inc. v. Fed. Mut. Ins. Co., 310 S.C. 477, 482, 427 S.E.2d 649, 651\r\n  (1993), overruled on other grounds, Joe Harden Builders, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., 326 S.C. 231, 486 S.E.2d 89 (1997). \r\n \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals relied on Wright in reversing the master.Â  In Wright, the\r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to reopen the record where\r\n  the moving party did not proffer any testimony or show that the evidence could\r\n  make any difference to the outcome of the case.Â  Wright, 306 S.C. at 188,\r\n  410 S.E.2d at 597.Â  The Court of Appeals distinguished Wright from the\r\n  instant case by noting that respondent attempted to proffer testimony[2] and that the additional testimony would have helped the master.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Court of Appeals also considered\r\n  that respondent did not learn it needed to establish damages in a different\r\n  fashion, i.e. apart from damages calculated for the deed claims, until after\r\n  the masterâ€™s ruling on the deed issues.\r\nWe disagree with the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ reasoning.Â  First, respondent was well aware before trial\r\n  that petitioner took the position that respondent could not prove damages stemming\r\n  from the elevation of Highway 501 and the road reconfiguration.Â  Petitioner maintained\r\n  this view throughout trial and provided expert testimony on the precise issue.Â \r\n  Respondent had ample opportunity to present testimony and evidence regarding\r\n  inverse condemnation damages at trial, but it instead decided to present\r\n  evidence of damages as if the deed would be rescinded and the property would be\r\n  valued as it existed prior to any condemnation proceeding.Â  The master did not\r\n  abuse his discretion by refusing to allow respondent a second opportunity to\r\n  present its inverse condemnation case after it failed on its other claims.Â  See Owens v. S.C. State Hwy. Dept., 239 S.C. 44, 54, 121 S.E.2d 240, 245\r\n  (1961) (landowner has the burden of proving its damages for a taking of its\r\n  property, whether through condemnation proceedings or inverse condemnation).\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appealsâ€™ citation of Wright in its reversal of the master may be read to\r\n  imply that a trial judge may abuse his discretion by refusing to reopen the\r\n  record simply because additional testimony is proffered and would make any difference to the outcome of the case.Â  This is not the proper standard for\r\n  reviewing a potential abuse of discretion in regard to post-trial motions to\r\n  reopen a record.Â  See Spinx, supra (no abuse of discretion\r\n  in declining to reopen the record when party could have provided same evidence\r\n  at trial).Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in remanding the case to\r\n  the master for the taking of additional testimony.[3]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  that after Hardin no inverse condemnation taking has occurred, we hold\r\n  that the master did not abuse his discretion in refusing to reopen the case.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals opinion is  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Michelle Childs, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Previously, Highway 501 was twenty-two feet above sea\r\n  level.Â  The grade elevation brought the highway to a total height of\r\n  forty-seven feet above sea level.Â   \r\n[2] Respondent offered to proffer testimony at the\r\n  hearing that addressed respondentâ€™s motion for reconsideration of the order\r\n  disposing of the inverse condemnation claim.\r\n[3] Furthermore, in light of our decision in Hardin v.\r\n  S.C. Dept. of Transp., 371 S.C. 598, 641 S.E.2d 437 (2007), petitionerâ€™s\r\n  actions in this case were not a taking by inverse condemnation.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26462","title":"Sloan Construction Company, Inc. v.

(â€œSouthcoâ€) as the general contractor on\r\n  a state highway maintenance project and in accordance with the relevant statutory\r\n  bond requirements, Southco provided SCDOT with proof of a payment bond for the\r\n  benefit of its subcontractors and suppliers covering the entire value of the\r\n  approximately $440,000 contract.Â  Southco subsequently contracted with\r\n  Petitioner Sloan Construction Company (â€œSloanâ€) to perform asphalt paving in\r\n  connection with the project.\r\nIn\r\n  June 2001, prior to the completion of the paving work, Southcoâ€™s payment bond\r\n  was cancelled due to the insolvency of the bondâ€™s issuer, Amwest Surety\r\n  Insurance Company (â€œAmwestâ€).Â  Upon notice of Amwestâ€™s insolvency, SCDOT wrote\r\n  Southco requesting proof of a replacement bond within seven days.Â  Southco\r\n  never responded.Â  In the meantime, Sloan completed its portion of the paving\r\n  subcontract valued at nearly $52,000.Â   \r\nSloan\r\n  notified SCDOT in January 2002 that it still had not received payment from\r\n  Southco for the work completed and additionally informed SCDOT that Southco had\r\n  not secured another payment bond following the cancellation of the Amwest\r\n  bond.Â  In March 2003, without having made full payment to Sloan, Southco\r\n  notified SCDOT that it had made all payments on the project and SCDOT disbursed\r\n  final retainage to Southco.\r\nSloan\r\n  brought an action for negligence against SCDOT pursuant to the South Carolina\r\n  Tort Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10 et. seq. (2005 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2006), alleging that SCDOT was negligent in failing to ensure that Southco was\r\n  properly bonded in accordance with the bond requirements in S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  29-6-250 (Supp. 2006) and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-1660 (2006).Â  Sloan also\r\n  brought a breach of contract claim alleging that SCDOT was obligated to Sloan\r\n  as a third-party beneficiary to the contract between SCDOT and Southco to\r\n  ensure that Southco was properly bonded pursuant to these statutes.\r\nÂ In\r\n  its answer, SCDOT moved to dismiss Sloanâ€™s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6),\r\n  SCRCP, arguing that the bond statutes did not create a duty giving rise to\r\n  liability for negligence on the part of SCDOT, and that SCDOT owed no\r\n  contractual duty to Sloan due to lack of privity.Â  The trial court granted\r\n  SCDOTâ€™s motion to dismiss finding that the South Carolina Tort Claims Act\r\n  prohibited Sloan from bringing a negligence claim against a government entity\r\n  for failing to enforce a statute, and noting that under the analogous federal\r\n  government bonding scheme contained in the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3131-3134\r\n  (2005), similar claims were not permitted on the grounds that the Federal Tort\r\n  Claims ActÂ  - like the South Carolina Tort Claims Act - prohibited claims for\r\n  violation of a federal statute in the absence of a similar state law cause of\r\n  action recognizing private liability.Â  Additionally, the trial court found that\r\n  lack of privity prohibited Sloanâ€™s contract claim.Â   \r\nSloan\r\n  appealed and the court of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision, holding\r\n  that Sloanâ€™s claims were prohibited under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act\r\n  and that no other right of action otherwise existed under the bond statutes.Â \r\n  The court of appeals never specifically addressed Sloanâ€™s contract claim.Â  Sloan\r\n    Constr. Co., Inc. v. Southco Grassing, Inc., 368 S.C. 523, 629 S.E.2d 372\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Â Â \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Sloanâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari and Sloan raises the\r\n  following issue for review:  \r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  court of appeals err in holding that statutory bond requirements applicable to\r\n  public projects do not create an enforceable duty giving rise to a private\r\n  right of action by a subcontractor against a government entity? \r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the dismissal of a claim for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a\r\n  cause of action under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard of review as the trial court.Â  Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  245, 247 (2007).Â  The question for the court is whether in the light most\r\n  favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the allegations\r\n  set forth on the face of the complaint state any\r\n  valid claim for relief.Â  Plyler v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 645, 647 S.E.2d 188, 192 (2007).Â  If\r\n  the â€œfacts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle\r\n  the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case,â€ then dismissal under\r\n  Rule 12(b)(6) is improper.Â  Stiles v. Oronato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457\r\n  S.E.2d 601, 603 (1995).  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nSloan\r\n  argues that the court of appeals erred in failing to find that the statutory\r\n  bond requirements give rise to a cause of action by a subcontractor against the\r\n  government for failure to ensure that general contractors on government\r\n  construction projects are properly bonded.Â Â  We agree.Â   \r\nA.Â Right of action arising under the bond statute \r\n\r\nPrior to the year 2000,\r\n  South Carolina law afforded limited protection to subcontractors and\r\n  suppliers providing labor and materials on public projects.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 11-30-3030 (Supp. 2006) (outlining a bonding scheme applicable to\r\n  projects under the direction of governmental bodies generally) and S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-1660 (outlining a bonding scheme specific to highway projects\r\n  under the direction of SCDOT).Â  Known as â€œLittle Miller Acts,â€ these provisions\r\n  are the state counterpart to the federal Miller Act legislation enacted to\r\n  address the problem of subcontractors who may not use liens on public property\r\n  to secure payment for work performed on public projects and must otherwise rely\r\n  on the financial solvency of prime contractors.Â  See United States v. Munsey\r\n    Trust Co. of Washington, D.C., 332 U.S. 234, 241 (1947).Â  See also Atl.\r\n      Coast Lumber Corp. v. Morrison, 152 S.C. 305, 309, 149 S.E. 243, 245 (1929)\r\n  (acknowledging that a mechanicsâ€™ lien may not be enforced on public property).Â \r\n  Consistent with the federal Miller Act, the bonding schemes contained in the\r\n  Little Miller Acts require both a performance bond to ensure the timely\r\n  performance of the contract by the general contractor and a payment bond to\r\n  cover payment of subcontractors and suppliers in the event of the general\r\n  contractorâ€™s default.Â  See Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-3030 and S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-1660.Â Â Â  Â \r\nÂ In\r\n  2000, the South Carolina legislature enacted the Subcontractorsâ€™ and Suppliersâ€™\r\n  Payment Protection Act (SPPA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 29-6-210 et. seq. (Supp. 2006).Â  The SPPA is specifically applicable to subcontractors and\r\n  suppliers on government projects and outlines a detailed bonding scheme that\r\n  significantly expands the protections already afforded these parties under the\r\n  Little Miller Acts.Â  The SPPA reads in pertinent part as follows:Â   \r\n\r\n\t(1)Â Â When\r\n  a governmental body is a party to a contract to improve real property, and the\r\n  contract is for a sum in excess of fifty thousand dollars, the owner of the\r\n  property shall require the contractor to provide a labor and material payment\r\n  bond in the full amount of the contract . . . .\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\t(3)Â For\r\n  purposes of any contract covered by the provisions of this section, it is the duty\r\n  of the entity contracting for the improvement to take reasonable steps to\r\n  assure that the appropriate payment bond is issued and is in proper form.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-250.Â  The\r\n  SPPA does not expressly provide for a right of action between the subcontractor\r\n  and the contracting government body.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals relied heavily on federal court interpretations of the Miller\r\n  Act in holding that statutory bonding requirements under the SPPA do not\r\n  establish a duty for which the government may be liable to a subcontractor.Â  See\r\n    Arvanis v. Noslo Engâ€™g Consultants, Inc., 739 F.2d 1287, 1290 (7th Cir. 1984)\r\n  (holding that the failure of a government agency to comply with the Miller\r\n  Actâ€™s bonding requirements does not give rise to a private right of action\r\n  against the agency) and Syro Steel Co. v. Eagle Constr. Co., Inc., 319\r\n  S.C. 180, 182, 460 S.E.2d 371, 373 (1995) (holding that absent a contrary\r\n  expression of legislative intent, cases construing the federal Miller Act will\r\n  be given great weight in interpreting the South Carolina counterpart).Â  We find\r\n  that the court of appeals improperly analyzed the SPPA bond statute under\r\n  Miller Act rubric in arriving at its conclusion.Â  The SPPA has neither ever\r\n  been characterized as a Little Miller Act nor does it otherwise appear to be patterned\r\n  after the Miller Act, which seeks to protect both the owner/government entity\r\n  and the subcontractor through its bonding requirements.Â  Instead, we look to\r\n  our jurisprudence which holds that when a statute defining a government duty\r\n  does not specifically create a private cause of action for breach of that duty,\r\n  a cause of action may be implied if the legislation was enacted for the special\r\n  benefit of a private party rather than the public at large.Â  Adkins v. S.C.\r\n    Dept. of Corr., 360 S.C. 413, 418, 602 S.E.2d 51, 54 (2004).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find that the relevant determination is whether an implied right of action\r\n  exists under the SPPA.Â   \r\nBeginning\r\n  with an analysis of the statutory framework, we first find that the very title\r\n  of the SPPA clearly indicates the General Assembly intended to provide stronger\r\n  payment protection specifically for subcontractors and suppliers on government\r\n  projects.Â  See Broadhurst v. City of\r\n    Myrtle Beach Elec. Commâ€™n, 342 S.C.\r\n  373, 381, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (using title of statute to support a\r\n  judicial interpretation).Â  We also find the\r\n  placement of the SPPA within the South Carolina Code significant.Â  Instead of appearing in the Procurement\r\n  Code,[1] the SPPA is framed solely in the context of payment security by virtue of its\r\n  location in Chapter 6 of Title 26, entitled â€œPayments to Contractors, Subcontractors,\r\n  and Suppliers.â€Â  This Court has long held that such remedial statutes should be liberally construed in\r\n  order to effectuate their purpose.Â  S.C. Dept. of Mental Health v. Hanna,\r\n  270 S.C. 210, 213, 241 S.E.2d 563, 564 (1978).Â   \r\nThe statutory terms which\r\n  tend to distinguish the SPPA from the Little Miller Acts likewise demonstrate\r\n  the SPPAâ€™s enactment for the particular benefit of subcontractors and suppliers.Â \r\n  First, the SPPA addresses only the requirement of a payment bond to protect\r\n  subcontractors in the event of a contractorâ€™s nonpayment.Â  The statute does not\r\n  mention a corresponding performance bond - required in the Little Miller Acts -\r\n  to protect the owner/government entity in the event of a contractorâ€™s\r\n  nonperformance.Â  Furthermore, the SPPA takes the Little Miller Actsâ€™ bond\r\n  requirement one step further by establishing both a duty on the part of the\r\n  governmental body to require payment bonding, as well as a standard of care for\r\n  overseeing the issuance of a proper payment bond.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  29-6-250 (providing that â€œit is the duty of the entity contracting for the\r\n  improvement to take reasonable steps to assure that the appropriate payment\r\n  bond is issued and is in proper formâ€).Â  In placing an affirmative duty on the\r\n  government that is absent from the Little Miller Acts, we find that the\r\n  legislature must have intended for those to whom the government owed the duty to\r\n  be able to vindicate their rights under a statute enacted for their special\r\n  benefit.Â  See State ex. rel. McLeod. v. Montgomery, 244\r\n  S.C. 308, 314, 136 S.E.2d 778, 782 (1964) (finding that a court must presume\r\n  that the legislature â€œintended\r\n  by its action to accomplish something and not to do a futile thingâ€); see\r\n    also Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t. of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C.\r\n  373, 388, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999) (acknowledging that an affirmative legal\r\n  duty may be created by statute (quoting Jensen v. Anderson County Dept. of\r\n    Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 195, 199, 403 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1991))).Â  For these\r\n  reasons, we hold that an implied private right of action by a subcontractor\r\n  against the government exists under the SPPA.[2]Â   \r\nWe briefly address SCDOTâ€™s\r\n  suggestion that a suit on the bond in the event of nonpayment - a remedy expressly\r\n  permitted under the statute[3] - adequately serves any legislative purpose to protect subcontractors.Â  In our\r\n  view, this argument fails.Â  A right to sue on the bond provides absolutely no\r\n  protection for the subcontractor where, as alleged here, the government agency\r\n  has altogether failed to secure or maintain proper bonding; clearly, a\r\n  subcontractor cannot sue on a bond that does not exist in the first instance.Â  Moreover,\r\n  a suit on the bond, standing alone, gives the government entity no incentive to\r\n  comply with the statuteâ€™s bonding requirement when the entity 1) has no\r\n  financial stake in the event of a contractorâ€™s nonpayment, and 2) no legal\r\n  stake in its own noncompliance.Â  In our opinion, the legislative purpose of the\r\n  SPPA is only served by permitting subcontractors and suppliers on government\r\n  projects - the only parties with a financial interest in enforcing the bond\r\n  requirements of the SPPA - to bring a claim under the statute.\r\nFinally, although neither\r\n  party raised the issue, the dissent asserts that the SPPA does not apply in the\r\n  instant case, and that the bonding provisions relevant to SCDOT highway\r\n  construction projects are found exclusively in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-1660\r\n  (2006).Â  In doing so, the dissent draws a dubious distinction between\r\n  â€œhighwaysâ€ and â€œroadwaysâ€ that cannot be sustained in light of the principle that\r\n  statutory language must be given its plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or\r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Cohenâ€™s\r\n    Drywall Co. Inc. v. Sea Spray Homes, 374 S.C. 195, 200, 648 S.E.2d 598, 600\r\n  (2007).Â  Although, as the dissent points out, there are apparent discrepancies\r\n  between Â§ 57-5-1660 and the SPPA,[4] a basic\r\n  presumption exists that the legislature has knowledge of previous legislation\r\n  when later statutes are passed on a related subject. Berkebile v. Outen,\r\n  311 S.C. 50, 53, 426 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1993).Â  Accordingly, and without an\r\n  indication of legislative intent to the contrary, we find that any directive on\r\n  the application of one statute to the exclusion of the other is within the\r\n  province of the legislature.Â  State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 275, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991) (holding that the legislature, and not the court, is\r\n  responsible for amending laws to resolve inconsistencies).\r\nIn\r\n  our view, the enactment of the SPPA in 2000 illustrates the legislatureâ€™s\r\n  intent to, in essence, pick up where the Little Miller Acts left off by\r\n  outlining a more extensive payment protection scheme dedicated specifically to\r\n  subcontractors and suppliers.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the duty created under\r\n  the SPPA gives rise to a private right of action against a government entity\r\n  for failure to ensure that a contractor is properly bonded.[5]Â   \r\n\r\nB.Â Third-party\r\n  beneficiary breach of contract claim\r\nSloan\r\n  contends that failure to comply with statutory bonding requirements gives rise\r\n  to a third-party beneficiary breach of contract claim by the subcontractor\r\n  against the government.[6]Â \r\n  Sloan therefore argues that the trial court erred in dismissing its breach of\r\n  contract claim against SCDOT based on lack of privity.Â  We agree, finding Judge\r\n  Richard Posnerâ€™s reasoning in A.E.I. Music Network, Inc. v. Business\r\n    Computers, Inc., 290 F.3d 952 (7th Cir. 2002) instructive on this matter.Â  \r\n \r\nIn A.E.I.\r\n  Music, a federal district court was asked to determine the nature of an\r\n  unpaid subcontractorâ€™s breach of contract claim against the city school board\r\n  for failing to require a contractor on a school construction project to post a\r\n  payment bond as required by the Illinois Bond Act. The Bond Act provided in\r\n  relevant part that in contracts for public work, â€œ[the contracting state\r\n  agency] shall require every contractor for the work to furnish, supply and\r\n  deliverâ€ a payment bond to the State in favor of subcontractors.Â  30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 550/1.Â  The court determined that because no bond had been in place\r\n  to begin with, the subcontractorâ€™s suit against the school board was not a suit\r\n  on the bond under the Bond Act.Â  A.E.I. Music, 290 F.3d at 954.Â \r\n  Rather, the court characterized the action as a third-party beneficiary suit\r\n  for breach of contract because the Actâ€™s bond requirement was read into every\r\n  construction contract of a public entity, and therefore, became a term of the\r\n  contract between the school board and the general contractor.Â  Id. at 955.Â  Because the term was intended to benefit the general\r\n  contractorâ€™s subcontractors, the subcontractor was a direct third-party\r\n  beneficiary - as opposed to an incidental beneficiary - and therefore entitled\r\n  to enforce the bond requirement.Â  Id.\r\nThe A.E.I.\r\n  Music courtâ€™s discussion contained numerous policy-based theories for\r\n  characterizing a subcontractor as a direct third-party beneficiary with the\r\n  right to sue on the primary contract.Â  Judge Posner explained that the\r\n  statutory bond requirement was a contractual term incorporated by the\r\n  legislature, and therefore, the â€œrelevant intentionsâ€ in determining whether a\r\n  third party could enforce the contract pursuant to the third-party beneficiary\r\n  doctrine were â€œno longer those of the parties but those of the legislature.â€Â Â  Id. at 955-56.Â  In creating a bond requirement, Judge Posner determined that\r\n  the legislature intended public works construction contracts to protect\r\n  subcontractors.Â  Because subcontractors would be the only ones with an interest\r\n  in enforcing this contractual term, carrying out the legislatureâ€™s intent\r\n  required enabling this protected class to enforce the contract.Â  Id. at 956.Â  Accordingly, the court held the subcontractorâ€™s claim sounded in\r\n  common law as a claim for breach of contract.[7]Â  Id. at 957.  \r\nWe\r\n  find the A.E.I. Music courtâ€™s analysis is equally applicable in this\r\n  case.Â  Recognizing that â€œthe underlying goals of the Procurement Code serve\r\n  important public interests concerning this particular contractual\r\n  relationship,â€ this Court has held that contracts formed pursuant to the\r\n  Procurement Code are deemed to incorporate the applicable statutory provisions\r\n  and such provisions shall prevail over conflicting contractual provisions.Â  Unisys\r\n    Corp. v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 346 S.C. 158, 171, 551 S.E.2d 263,\r\n  271 (2001).Â  Although not located in the Procurement Code, the SPPA is\r\n  generally applicable to public procurement.Â  Therefore, we find that an\r\n  incorporation of the SPPAâ€™s bonding requirements into public works contracts is\r\n  consistent with this Courtâ€™s reasoning in Unisys Corp.Â   \r\nEven\r\n  without reference to the Procurement Code, the SPPA serves important public\r\n  interests in its own right.Â  Seeking to protect subcontractorsâ€™ payment rights\r\n  on government projects encourages competitive bidding, which results in the most\r\n  economically efficient use of tax dollars and other sources of public funding.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that the bonding requirements of the SPPA are incorporated\r\n  into construction contracts governed by the statute.  \r\nFinally,\r\n  we find that under established contract law in South Carolina, subcontractors have\r\n  enforceable rights as third-party beneficiaries to construction contracts\r\n  incorporating the SPPA.Â  See Bob Hammond Constr. Co., Inc. v. Banks\r\n    Constr. Co., 312 S.C. 422, 424, 440 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App. 1994) (noting\r\n  that where a contract between two parties is intended to create a direct\r\n  benefit to a third party, the third party may enforce the contract).Â  Because\r\n  the legislature intended to protect contractors by creating bonding\r\n  requirements, and because the subcontractors are the only ones with a financial\r\n  stake in enforcing the bond requirements, subcontractors are direct third-party\r\n  beneficiaries to the contract between a government entity and a general\r\n  contractor to which the SPPA is applicable. Â For this reason, the government\r\n  may be liable to a subcontractor for breach of contract for failing to comply\r\n  with the SPPA bonding requirements.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that a government agencyâ€™s failure to secure and maintain statutory\r\n  bonding as required by the SPPA gives rise to a third-party beneficiary breach\r\n  of contract action by a subcontractor.\r\nC.Â Extent of governmental liability\r\nWe\r\n  clarify our holding today by emphasizing that the governmentâ€™s liability for\r\n  failure to ensure compliance with statutory bond requirements is not\r\n  open-ended.Â  The purpose of the SPPA is similar to that underlying the\r\n  subcontractorâ€™s lien outlined in the mechanicsâ€™ lien statute, see S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-20 (1991), which is to protect a party who provides labor or\r\n  materials for the improvement of property but does not have a contractual\r\n  relationship with the property owner.Â  Stoudenmire Heating &amp; Air Conditioning\r\n    Co., Inc. v. Craig Bldg. Pâ€™ship, 308 S.C. 298, 302, 417 S.E.2d 634, 637\r\n  (Ct. App. 1992).Â  The subcontractorâ€™s lien, however, is not intended to create\r\n  a windfall to the subcontractor.Â  The mechanicsâ€™ lien statute provides that when\r\n  a subcontractor seeks to enforce a mechanicsâ€™ lien against the owner of the\r\n  improved property due to the general contractorâ€™s nonpayment, the ownerâ€™s liability\r\n  is limited to the remaining unpaid balance on the contract with the general\r\n  contractor at the time the owner receives notice from the subcontractor of the\r\n  general contractorâ€™s nonpayment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-40 (1991); Lowndes\r\n    Hill Realty Co. v. Greenville Concrete Co., 229 S.C. 619, 630, 93 S.E.2d\r\n  855, 860 (1956).Â  Given the similar purposes behind the SPPA bond requirements for\r\n  public projects and the subcontractorsâ€™ mechanicsâ€™ lien on private work, we\r\n  hold that in a tort or contract action arising under the SPPA, the government\r\n  entityâ€™s liability is limited to the remaining unpaid balance on the contract\r\n  with the general contractor when the subcontractor notifies the government of\r\n  the general contractorâ€™s nonpayment.Â  This limitation, however, does not\r\n  preclude the additional recovery of attorneysâ€™ fees under any applicable\r\n  statute.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision affirming the dismissal of Sloanâ€™s claims\r\n  against SCDOT.Â  Â Considering only the allegations set forth on the face of the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s complaint for purposes of our review today, we find that a\r\n  resolution of Sloanâ€™s claim by this Court on the merits is factually\r\n  premature.Â  Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court for a\r\n  determination of SCDOTâ€™s liability to Sloan consistent with this opinion.\r\nWALLER, J., and Acting\r\n  Justice Alexander S. Macaulay, concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion in which Acting Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  The trial court held, and\r\n  I agree, that the SPPA does not apply to this contract for highway\r\n  improvements, the relevant bonding provisions being those found in S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 57-5-1660 (2006). I would accordingly vacate that part of the Court of\r\n  Appeals opinion which addresses the merits of the SPPA claim, and affirm.\r\nSouth Carolina Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 57-5-1660 is found in a chapter of the Code entitled â€œState Highway\r\n  System:â€ more specifically, this statute is found in the article of that\r\n  chapter entitled â€œConstruction Contracts and Purchases.â€ Section 57-5-1660\r\n  governs â€œContractorsâ€™ bonds; amounts and actions thereonâ€ and provides in\r\n  relevant part:\r\n\r\n\t(a)Â \r\n  The Department of Transportation shall require that the contractor on every\r\n  public highway construction contract, exceeding ten thousand dollars, furnish\r\n  the Department of Transportation, county, or road district the following bonds,\r\n  which shall become binding upon the award of the contract to such contractor:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;A performance and indemnity bondâ€¦.\r\n\t\t(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;A payment bond with a surety or\r\n  sureties satisfactory to the awarding authority, and in the amount of not less\r\n  than fifty percent of the contract, for the protection of all persons supplying\r\n  labor and materials in the prosecution of work provided for in the contract for\r\n  the use of each such person.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe statute requires a bond\r\n  before the contract was let, a condition which was admittedly complied with,\r\n  and contains no requirement that DOT keep a viable bond in place throughout the\r\n  project.Â  Even if this statute created a privately enforceable duty, DOT has\r\n  not breached it.\r\nThe SPPA upon which\r\n  the majority rests its decision, is simply inapplicable to a State Highway\r\n  Department construction project.Â  The â€œlabor and material bondâ€ statute cited\r\n  by the majority applies when a governmental body, including DOT, enters â€œa\r\n  contract to improve real property.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-250 (1)(2007).Â  Such\r\n  a contract is let by the propertyâ€™s owner to:\r\n\r\n\t(2)Â \r\n  â€œImproveâ€ means to build, effect, alter, repair, or demolish any improvement\r\n  upon, connected with, or on or beneath the surface of any real property, or to\r\n  excavate, clear, grade, fill, or landscape any real property, or to construct\r\n  driveways and roadways, or to furnish materials, including trees and shrubbery,\r\n  for any of these purposes, or to perform any labor upon these improvements, and\r\n  also means and includes any design or other professional or skilled services\r\n  furnished by architects, engineers, land surveyors, and landscape architects.\r\n\tS. C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-10 (2)(2007).Â  \r\n\r\nIn other words, when DOT has\r\n  a parking lot repaved, or relandscapes an area adjoining its offices, or even\r\n  when it contracts to build a new access road for a heavy equipment depot, it is\r\n  subject to this act.Â  A State Highway construction project, however, is neither\r\n  a driveway nor a roadway within the ambit of the SPPA.Â  Moreover, even if the\r\n  SPPA were implicated by a such a project, Â§ 29-6-250(1) merely requires the\r\n  governmental entity entering the real estate improvement contractÂ  â€œtake\r\n  reasonable steps to assure that the appropriate bond is issued and is in proper\r\n  form.â€Â  Here, there is no contention that DOT breached its duty to see that the\r\n  AMWEST bond was issued, and that it was in proper form.Â  As in Â§ 57-5-1660,\r\n  there is no obligation placed on the governmental entity to monitor the bond\r\n  status after it has been issued.Â  Accordingly, even assuming the SPPA applies,\r\n  no breach of statutory duty has been alleged here.\r\nFinally, I simply\r\n  do not understand that part of the majority opinion which upholds Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  right to maintain a third party breach of contract claim.Â  Here, unlike the\r\n  situation in A.E.I., a proper bond was procured and accordingly there is\r\n  no need to resort to the third party theory.Â  In a breathtaking gesture, the\r\n  majority incorporates the bond requirements of the SPPA into every public works\r\n  contract â€œgoverned by the statute,â€ apparently losing sight of the fact the\r\n  statute only applies to contracts for the improvement of real estate, and then\r\n  requires a bond only if the amount of the contract exceeds $50,000.[8]Â \r\n  Using a Procurement Code analogy and legislative powers, the majority goes on\r\n  to â€œlimitâ€ governmental liability and suggests that attorneyâ€™s fees may somehow\r\n  be recoverable from an unnamed statutory source, inferentiallyÂ  the mechanicâ€™s\r\n  lien statute.Â  Showing greater restraint, the majority, while reversing the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s dismissal of the complaint, does refrain from ruling prematurely\r\n  in Petitionerâ€™s favor.\r\nI am awed by the\r\n  majorityâ€™s decision but I cannot join it.Â  Highway Construction bonding\r\n  contracts are governed solely by Â§ 57-5-1660.Â  The trial court was correct in\r\n  dismissing this complaint, and the Court of Appeals, although using reasoning\r\n  which I do not entirely concur in, properly affirmed.Â  I would uphold the\r\n  dismissal for the reasons given above.  \r\nActing\r\n  Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-10 et. seq. (1986 &amp; Supp. 2006).\r\n[2] As described in the factual background of this case, Sloan purported to bring\r\n  an action in negligence under both the SPPA and the Little Miller Act\r\n  applicable to state highway projects.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-1660.Â \r\n  We see no reason to reject the court of appealsâ€™ reliance on federal Miller Act\r\n  interpretations in finding that no implied right of action exists under the\r\n  Little Miller Act bond statute.Â  Moreover, any existence of such an action\r\n  under the Little Miller Act bond statute would be duplicative given our holding\r\n  today.\r\n[3] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-1-120 (Supp. 2006)\r\n  (incorporating into the SPPA by reference a provision which allows a suit on\r\n  the bond by the subcontractor against the contractor in the event of nonpayment).\r\n[4] The primary substantive differences in the statutory bonding requirements is\r\n  that under Â§ 57-5-1660, the contractorâ€™s performance and payment bonds are\r\n  required on contracts exceeding $10,000 and must be with a surety â€œsatisfactory\r\n  to the awarding authority,â€ which under SCDOT regulations, is a surety with a\r\n  minimum rating of â€œBâ€.Â  Additionally, Â§ 57-5-1660 requires the payment bond to\r\n  have a face value of at least 50% of the contract.Â  The SPPA, on the other\r\n  hand, requires a bond on contracts exceeding $50,000 and provides that the bond\r\n  must be issued by a surety with a minimum rating of â€œAâ€.Â  The payment bond\r\n  under the SPPA is only required to have a face value of 10% of the contract.Â \r\n \r\n[5] Sloan additionally argues that the court of appeals erred in finding that the\r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act bars a claim against a government agency for\r\n  failure to enforce statutory bonding requirements.Â  Although we find that the\r\n  court of appeals incorrectly based its conclusion with respect to the SPPA on\r\n  this issue on federal Miller Act jurisprudence, we nevertheless agree that a\r\n  claim for failure to enforce the bonding requirements of the SPPA is not\r\n  properly brought pursuant to the Tort Claims Act because the Act does not act\r\n  as a waiver of sovereign immunity when a governmental entity fails to enforce a\r\n  statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(4) (2005).Â  See also Hawkins\r\n    v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 292-93, 594 S.E.2d 557, 563-64 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004) (noting that the South Carolina Tort Claims Act is only a limited\r\n  waiver of sovereign immunity for tort claims against government entities and\r\n  does not create new substantive causes of action).Â  Therefore, the Tort Claims\r\n  Act is not relevant to the governmentâ€™s liability for failure to comply with a\r\n  duty under the SPPA.Â   \r\n[6] A sovereign is not immune from a suit based on its breach\r\n  of a contractual obligation.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 92, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 585 (2000).Â Â Â   \r\n[7] Although the primary issue in A.E.I. Music was\r\n  whether the subcontractorâ€™s claim was governed by the statute of limitations in\r\n  the Illinois Bond Act or the common law statute of limitations for contract\r\n  actions, we find Judge Posnerâ€™s reasoning as to the subcontractorâ€™s rights and\r\n  characterization as a third-party beneficiary is nonetheless instructive in\r\n  this case.Â   \r\n[8] The effect of the majorityâ€™s decision is to import the SPPA into highway\r\n  construction contracting.Â  It therefore appears that although Â§ 57-5-1660\r\n  requires a bond whenever the highway construction contract exceeds $10,000,\r\n  that monetary threshold is superseded by the SPPA, which requires a bond only\r\n  when the contact exceeds $50,000.Â  It is unclear to me how this ruling provides\r\n  â€œa more extensive payment protection scheme dedicated specifically to\r\n  subcontractors and suppliers.â€  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26463","title":"Haggins v.

[1]Â \r\n  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari made pursuant to Rule\r\n  226, SCACR, to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ denial and now dismiss the writ as\r\n  improvidently granted. We hold that, as a matter of policy, we will not\r\n  entertain Rule 226 petitions where the Court of Appeals has exercised its\r\n  discretion and denied a Rule 227 petition, and no formal opinion or order has\r\n  been filed.\r\nThis Court has held that it will grant certiorari to the\r\n  Court of Appeals â€œonly where special reasons justify the exercise of that\r\n  power.â€Â  In re Exhaustion of State\r\n    Remedies in Criminal and Post-Conviction Relief Cases, 321 S.C. 563, 471 S.E.2d 454 (1990), cited with\r\n  approval in Douglas v.

Carter, of the South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n  and Assistant Attorney General Daniel E. Grigg, all of the Office of the\r\n  Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  Counsel for\r\n  petitioner has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, pursuant to Johnson\r\n    v. State, 294 S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988), from the denial, after a\r\n  hearing, of petitionerâ€™s application for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â \r\n  Petitioner has filed a pro se response.\r\nWe\r\n  grant the petition for a writ of certiorari on the issue of the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  refusal to relieve PCR counsel,[1] dispense with the requirements of a merits petition and brief, and affirm the\r\n  denial of petitionerâ€™s PCR application.Â  However, we take this opportunity to\r\n  address the recurring problem of PCR applicants seeking repeatedly, and without\r\n  sufficient cause, to have their appointed counsel relieved.[2]Â  In the case at hand, although the exact\r\n  number of these motions is unclear, at least nine motions to relieve PCR\r\n  counsel or to be relieved as PCR counsel were made, and many of those motions\r\n  were granted.Â  Such tactics constitute an abuse of the judicial process,\r\n  resulting in significant delays,[3] and should not be tolerated, much less acquiesced in, by judges presiding over\r\n  PCR matters.\r\nWhile\r\n  there is no constitutional obligation to appoint counsel in a PCR matter, in\r\n  South Carolina, if a PCR application\r\n  presents questions of law or fact requiring a hearing, and the applicant is\r\n  indigent, state law provides that counsel must be appointed or a knowing,\r\n  intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must be obtained. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-27-60 (2003); Rule 71.1(d), SCRCP; Whitehead v. State, 310 S.C. 532,\r\n  426 S.E.2d 315 (1992); see also Gary v. State, 347 S.C.\r\n  627, 557 S.E.2d 662 (2001)(Counsel should be appointed when the State moves for\r\n  dismissal on the ground the application was not timely filed where the\r\n  applicant raises an issue of material fact regarding the applicability of the\r\n  one-year statute of limitation.).Â  However, a PCR applicant is not entitled to\r\n  appointed counsel of choice.Â  While an applicant may have the right to reject or discharge court-appointed counsel and proceed pro se or retain his own counsel, he does not\r\n  have the right, without a showing of satisfactory cause to refuse or dismiss\r\n  the counsel appointed and have other counsel appointed.Â  State v. Jones,\r\n  270 S.C. 587, 243 S.E.2d 461 (1978).Â   \r\nA mere disagreement between an applicant and his counsel as to how\r\n  to proceed with the PCR application, including the allegations to be raised, is\r\n  not sufficient cause, in itself, to require the PCR judge to replace or to\r\n  offer to replace court appointed counsel with another attorney.Â  Id.Â  Many times, such as in the case at hand, an applicant does not understand the\r\n  PCR process, including the fact that the allegations that can be raised are\r\n  limited by law.Â  Counsel should not be relieved, and the process delayed,\r\n  because an applicant is dissatisfied with counselâ€™s legitimate refusal to\r\n  pursue allegations that are meritless and/or not proper in PCR.Â  Cf. State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 548 S.E.2d 210 (2001)(trial judge\r\n  did not err in denying defendantâ€™s motion to relieve counsel where defendant\r\n  alleged counsel was not representing his interests, was not fully prepared for\r\n  this case, and the defendant asserted he did not feel comfortable going to\r\n  court with counsel as his lawyer); State v. Hyman, 276 S.C. 559, 281\r\n  S.E.2d 209 (1981), overruled on other grounds, State v. Torrence,\r\n  305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991)(trial judge did not\r\n  abuse his discretion in denying defendantâ€™s motion to relieve counsel based on\r\n  defendantâ€™s allegation that counsel was not up to date on the law).\r\nAnother common tactic in PCR matters is for the applicant to file\r\n  a complaint against appointed counsel with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.Â \r\n  The complaint is then asserted as a basis for a motion to relieve counsel or a\r\n  motion to be relieved as counsel.Â  We caution the bench that the filing of a\r\n  disciplinary complaint should not result in automatic removal of appointed\r\n  counsel.Â  If this were not the case, applicants\r\n  could obtain substitute counsel by the simple expedient of filing an ethical\r\n  complaint even if that complaint is without any factual or legal basis.Â  Instead, the basis for the complaint should be explored\r\n  and the PCR judge should exercise discretion in determining whether the basis\r\n  for the complaint constitutes sufficient cause to relieve counsel.[4]Â  Again, applicants must not be allowed to employ tactics\r\n  such as these to manipulate the PCR process.\r\nIn the case at hand, the PCR judge properly denied the motion to\r\n  be relieved as counsel, as the basis for the\r\n  motion, as well as the previous motions to relieve counsel or be relieved as counsel\r\n  filed in this case, was petitionerâ€™s dissatisfaction with PCR counsel because\r\n  counsel would not pursue allegations, by way of subpoenas and discovery, which\r\n  were clearly meritless and/or not proper for PCR.Â  State v. Jones, supra.Â \r\n  The PCR judgeâ€™s order is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  MOORE, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] We deny certiorari on the remaining issues raised in\r\n  the Johnson petition and pro se response.\r\n[2] In some cases, applicants file a motion to relieve\r\n  counsel, while in other cases, such as the one at hand, PCR counsel files a\r\n  motion to be relieved as counsel at the behest of the applicant.Â  On most\r\n  occasions, motions to be relieved as counsel, even if not made at the behest of\r\n  the applicant, are based on the applicantâ€™s insistence on raising allegations\r\n  that are without merit and/or improper for PCR, counselâ€™s refusal to pursue\r\n  such allegations, and the applicantâ€™s resulting dissatisfaction with counsel.\r\n[3] The PCR application in this matter was filed in 1998.\r\n[4] Pursuant to Rule 12(a) of the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, neither the attorney nor the\r\n  complainant are prohibited from disclosing the existence of an ethical\r\n  complaint.Â  However, if the attorney does not want the existence of the\r\n  complaint revealed, or client confidences may be revealed in determining\r\n  whether the underlying basis of the complaint establishes good cause to relieve\r\n  counsel, the procedure set forth in Rule 12(d), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, may be\r\n  followed.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26465","title":"Doe v.

Martin Bros.,\r\n    Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 630 S.E.2d 42 (2006).\r\nMental or nervous\r\n  disorders are compensable provided the emotional stimuli or stressors are\r\n  incident to or arise from unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  Powell\r\n    v. Vulcan Materials Co., 299 S.C. 325, 384 S.E.2d 725 (1989) (adopting analysis\r\n  of Stokes v. First Natâ€™l Bank, 298 S.C. 13, 377 S.E.2d 922 (Ct. App.1988)).Â \r\n  In Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000), we Â surveyed\r\n  different approaches to determining what constitutes an â€œunusual and\r\n  extraordinaryâ€ condition of employment.Â  We concluded the standard to be\r\n  applied is whether the work conditions at issue were unusual compared to the particular\r\n  employeeâ€™s normal strains.Â  341 S.C. at 457, 535 S.E.2d at 443 (citing 2\r\n  Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§\r\n  44.05(4)(d)(i) (1999)).Â   \r\nHere, the\r\n  commissioner found there were no extraordinary or unusual conditions in\r\n  Claimantâ€™s employment.Â  He concluded it was not unexpected that patients would\r\n  be moved from one facility to another, that workers would be subjected to\r\n  aggressive behavior from patients, or that the amount of care needed by\r\n  patients would change.Â  The circuit court found the commissionerâ€™s findings,\r\n  adopted by the full Commission, were unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  The court\r\n  focused on the fact that the mix of passive and aggressive patients was an\r\n  extraordinary and unusual condition in Claimantâ€™s employment and concluded this\r\n  caused Claimantâ€™s stress-related mental injury.Â  We agree with the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s analysis.\r\nThe record\r\n  indicates that in the spring of 1997, with the new mix of passive and\r\n  aggressive patients in Claimantâ€™s unit, behavior problems escalated because of\r\n  the â€œdomino effectâ€ created when an aggressive patient acted out.Â  Claimant had\r\n  never before worked with a mix of passive and aggressive patients.Â  No other\r\n  unit had a mix of passive and aggressive patients.Â  In fact, Department made\r\n  changes after a DHEC survey criticized Department for housing diverse patients\r\n  together.Â   \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed the circuit court, finding substantial evidence in the record\r\n  that supported the Commissionâ€™s conclusion there were no extraordinary and\r\n  unusual conditions in Claimantâ€™s employment.Â  The Court of Appeals relied on\r\n  the testimony of Claimantâ€™s two co-workers, Tenia Rae Allen and Kim Willis.Â  A\r\n  review of the record, however, indicates that the testimony relied upon is\r\n  taken completely out of context and does not support the Court of Appealsâ€™\r\n  conclusion.\r\nFirst, the Court of\r\n  Appeals noted the testimony of Tenia Rae Allen, a nurse supervisor, stating\r\n  that it was not unusual for nurses to deal with aggressive patients and nurses\r\n  were injured even before aggressive patients were transferred to Claimantâ€™s\r\n  unit.Â  Nurse Allen never stated that it was usual for a nurse to deal with a\r\n  mix of passive and aggressive patients.Â  In fact, she testified that Claimantâ€™s\r\n  unit became â€œpretty chaoticâ€ with the new mix of patients and there was a\r\n  significant increase in violent behavior even among the patients who formerly\r\n  were fairly well-controlled.Â  She observed that the change in Claimantâ€™s unit\r\n  was â€œpretty dramatic,â€ and â€œyes, I think it could really depress somebody to be\r\n  there.â€Â  Other units housed only volatile patients but were smaller units and\r\n  the staff was used to handling those patients.Â  As a whole, Nurse Allenâ€™s\r\n  testimony supports the conclusion that the mix of passive and aggressive\r\n  patients in Claimantâ€™s unit was an extraordinary and unusual condition compared\r\n  to the normal strains of Claimantâ€™s employment.Â   \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals also noted the testimony of Nurse Willis that, in her experience, there\r\n  are always patients who are harder to deal with, she expects changes in the\r\n  types of patients she deals with, and physical confrontation with patients is\r\n  not unusual.Â  Nurse Willis, however, never discussed caring for a mixed group\r\n  of passive and aggressive patients.Â  She did say that Claimantâ€™s unit had an\r\n  increase in patients with behavioral problems, including one patient who\r\n  screamed continuously, and that the difference in caring for â€œlow levelâ€ and\r\n  â€œhigh levelâ€ patients was a substantial change.Â   \r\nFinally, the Court\r\n  of Appeals observed that Claimant had non-work related stressors, including a\r\n  prior bout with depression in 1980 and her fatherâ€™s cancer and death in\r\n  December 1997, that â€œcould impact her mental injury.â€Â  There is no support in\r\n  the record for the conclusion that any of these outside factors caused or even\r\n  contributed to Claimantâ€™s disability.Â  The only evidence of causation is that\r\n  Claimantâ€™s mental injury was caused by her stress at work as stated by Dr.\r\n  Lowe.Â  Moreover, a history of pre-existing depression does not preclude workersâ€™\r\n  compensation benefits for a mental-mental injury.Â  See Ellison v.\r\n    Frigidaire Home Prods., 371 S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006) (an injured\r\n  claimant is entitled to benefits for disability arising from a permanent\r\n  impairment in combination with a pre-existing impairment if the combined effect\r\n  results in a substantially greater disability).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no\r\n  substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s denial of\r\n  benefits.Â  Accordingly, we remand for the Commission to award benefits based on\r\n  Claimantâ€™s disability arising from her mental-mental injury.Â   \r\nWALLER, J., and\r\n  Acting Justice Doyet A. Early, III, concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a\r\n  separate opinion.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal: I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse this\r\n  case, but I write separately because I would resolve the case on different\r\n  grounds.Â  In my view, two of the tribunals below committed similar errors of\r\n  law in failing to properly apply the standard for evaluating a workersâ€™\r\n  compensation claim for mental injuries brought about by emotional stress or\r\n  stimuli.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse this case without determining whether\r\n  the lower courtsâ€™ findings have evidentiary support.\r\nThe reasoning of the single commissioner shares a\r\n  fatal flaw with that employed by the court of appeals in reinstating the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s decision. Â In my view, that fatal flaw is the focus on the\r\n  ordinary aspects of Petitionerâ€™s employment to the exclusion of an examination\r\n  of the extraordinary, and the consequent use of those ordinary aspects to\r\n  support the conclusion that Petitionerâ€™s injury is not compensable.Â  In Stokes\r\n    v. First Natâ€™l Bank, the court of appeals adopted the view that mental\r\n  injuries are compensable if, as in heart attack cases, the mental injury is\r\n  induced either by physical injury or by unusual or extraordinary conditions of\r\n  employment.Â  298 S.C. 13, 21, 377 S.E.2d 922, 926 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  We affirmed\r\n  that decision, noting:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œinjury by accidentâ€ . . .\r\n  has been construed to mean not only an injury the means or cause of which is an\r\n  accident, but also an injury which is itself an accident; that is, an injury\r\n  occurring unexpectedly from the operation of internal or subjective conditions,\r\n  without the prior occurrence of any external event of an accidental character .\r\n  . . [i]n determining whether something constitutes an â€œinjury by accidentâ€ the\r\n  focus is not on some specific event, but rather on the injury itself.\r\n\r\nStokes\r\n  v. First Natâ€™l Bank, 306 S.C. 46,\r\n  49-50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1991).\r\nIn my view, both the single commissioner and the court\r\n  of appeals failed to consider whether the changed conditions of Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  employment were, for her, unusual or extraordinary, and similarly failed to\r\n  evaluate how the changed conditions affected Petitioner.Â  I believe this was\r\n  error under Stokes, and based on this error of law, I would reverse.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â Â Â Â Â Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I believe the Court of\r\n  Appeals correctly held that the Commissionâ€™s decision was supported by\r\n  substantial evidence, and I would affirm the denial of benefits to Claimant.\r\nBecause we granted\r\n  certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals, our standard of review\r\n  requires us to determine whether the Court of Appeals properly held that the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record.[4]\r\nWhile I am\r\n  sympathetic to Claimantâ€™s struggle with depression, I cannot find error with\r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion.Â  Claimant was an experienced LPN whose\r\n  patients suffered from severe mental retardation and cognitive disabilities.Â \r\n  The Department produced sufficient evidence to show that: (a) the change in the\r\n  type of patients under Claimantâ€™s care was neither unexpected nor unusual; (b)\r\n  Claimant was trained to handle aggressive patients; and (c) although\r\n  unfortunate, it was not unusual for Department nurses to be subjected to\r\n  aggressive and sometimes violent behavior.Â  Despite the fact that Claimant\r\n  presented ample evidence to support her position, the Commissionâ€™s findings\r\n  must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.Â  See Shealy v.\r\n    Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000) (substantial\r\n  evidence is not evidence viewed solely from one side; it is evidence, when the\r\n  whole record is considered, that would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion the Commission reached).\r\nThe\r\n  Commission found that Claimant was not exposed to unusual and extraordinary\r\n  conditions in her employment, and in light of the entire record, this\r\n  conclusion is tenable.Â  Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Appeals\r\n  because the Commissionâ€™s findings are supported by substantial evidence.\r\n\r\n[1]364 S.C. 411, 613 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\n \r\n[2]The number of incidents decreased in June 1997 to 87\r\n  and continued declining until the fall of 1997.\r\n[3]Claimant also alleged mental injury stemming from\r\n  physical injuries she sustained on the job.Â  This claim was denied and is not\r\n  an issue here.  \r\n[4] Under the Administrative Procedures Act, we may not\r\n  substitute our judgment for that of a state agency as to the weight of evidence\r\n  on questions of fact, but we may reverse or modify decisions which are clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.

The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Richland County Clerk of Court have filed separate returns. \r\n On June 15, 2004, petitioner filed a motion entitled Motion: Emergency Writ of Habeas Corpus (2004 habeas petition) in the circuit court.  Petitioner claims he filed a motion of dismissal in the circuit court in August 2007. \r\n Petitioner has filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this Court in which he alleges the Richland County Clerk of Court and the State failed to respond to his 2004 habeas petition and his motion of dismissal.  He further claims the State failed to set a court date for the hearing he requested.  Petitioner requests the State be ordered to set a hearing on his motions.\r\n The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office filed a return indicating they were unaware of petitioner&rsquo;s filings in the circuit court, and had they been aware of the 2004 habeas petition, they would have moved to summarily dismiss the petition as an untimely application for post-conviction relief (PCR).\r\n By way of return, the Richland County Clerk of Court acknowledges the filing of the 2004 habeas petition.  However, the Clerk of Court maintains there is no evidence the motion of dismissal was received.  In addition, she states the petition for a writ of mandamus was not received by her until it was sent to her by this Court along with a request for a return. \r\n The Clerk of Court contends the 2004 habeas petition was without merit on several procedural and substantive grounds.  Specifically, she argues the 2004 habeas petition was neither in the form prescribed for a PCR application nor did it contain information required for a PCR application pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-50 (2003).  Also, she maintains the 2004 habeas petition amounted to an untimely PCR application. \r\n In addition, she argues the 2004 habeas petition, construed as a PCR application, contained only conclusory allegations, and would likely have been dismissed as time barred or found to be without substantive merit.  Also, the Clerk claims the 2004 habeas petition did not raise a violation which constituted a &ldquo;denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice&rdquo; pursuant to Simpson v. State, 329 S.C. 43, 495 S.E.2d 429 (1998). \r\n The Clerk argues petitioner failed to allege grounds warranting the issuance of a writ of mandamus.  She claims, because the 2004 habeas petition did not conform to requirements for a PCR application, &ldquo;it did not trigger a duty . . . to take any particular action.&rdquo;  In addition, she maintains the decision when and where to set a hearing is discretionary rather than mandatory.  The Clerk further contends the 2004 habeas petition was mooted by petitioner&rsquo;s release from incarceration into the Community Supervision Program because the only purpose of a habeas corpus petition is to seek release from the current term of incarceration.\r\n Mandamus is the highest judicial writ and is issued to compel a public official to perform a ministerial duty, not a discretionary duty, and only when there is a specific right to be enforced, a positive duty to be performed, and no other available legal remedy.  Riverwoods, L.L.C. v. County of Charleston, 349 S.C. 378, 563 S.E.2d 651 (2002); City of Rock Hill v. Thompson, 349 S.C. 197, 563 S.E.2d 101 (2002); Ex parte Littlefield, 343 S.C. 212, 540 S.E.2d 81 (2000); Redmond v. Lexington County Sch. Dist. No. 4, 314 S.C. 431, 445 S.E.2d 445 (1994). \r\n Upon the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the Clerk of Court should verify the document contains a case caption, a proper county designation, and the signature of the filing party, and should forward a copy of the petition to the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.  S.C. Clerk of Court Manual &sect; 6.24.\r\n Because petitioner failed to name the Clerk of Court as a party or serve his petition for a writ of mandamus on her, he may not seek mandamus relief as to her.  Thompson, supra (holding a party seeking mandamus must serve the party against whom relief is sought).  Moreover, the 2004 habeas petition became moot upon petitioner&rsquo;s release from incarceration.  Gibson v. State, 329 S.C. 37, 495 S.E.2d 426 (1998) (&ldquo;The inquiry on habeas corpus is limited to the legality of the prisoner's present detention.&rdquo;) (emphasis added). Also, petitioner has not shown the Clerk failed to perform any duty as to the\r\n  motion of dismissal because the evidence indicates the motion of dismissal was never received by the Clerk.  Accordingly, the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied. \r\n However, we take this opportunity to emphasize the Clerk of Court&rsquo;s duties regarding the filing of a petition for habeas corpus.  The Clerk of Court has the ministerial duty to verify the petition contains a case caption, a proper county designation, and the signature of the filing party, and to forward a copy of the petition to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  S.C. Clerk of Court Manual &sect; 6.24.  The Clerk of Court&rsquo;s duty is not discretionary.  The Clerk of Court should not construe a petition for a writ of habeas corpus as a PCR application.  In addition, although a habeas corpus petition may be flawed on a number of procedural and substantive grounds, it is not within the Clerk of Court&rsquo;s authority to refuse to perform her duty based on her opinion that a filing lacks legal merit or is untimely.  21 C.J.S. Courts &sect; 338 (2006) (&ldquo;[A] clerk of court cannot ordinarily determine questions of law [or] render judgments.&rdquo;). \r\n IT IS SO ORDERED. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     s/Jean H.

Owners Group v. Public\r\n    Service Commâ€™n, 357 S.C. 232, 593 S.E.2d 148 (2004).Â  The Commissionâ€™s\r\n  findings are presumptively correct, requiring the party challenging an order to\r\n  show the decision is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on\r\n  the record.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â \r\nFailure of proof\r\nTime Warner contends the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s order denying its application based on a failure of proof is\r\n  arbitrary and capricious since the Commission granted it an expansion of\r\n  certification in another case based on the same record.Â  \r\nSome procedural background is relevant here.Â  Time\r\n  Warner was originally certified as a local exchange carrier (LEC) to provide\r\n  VoIP retail services in May 2004.Â  A certificate was granted subject to a\r\n  stipulation that Time Warner was seeking to serve customers only inÂ  areas\r\n  where the existing LEC did not have a federal rural exemption.[3]Â \r\n  Time Warner subsequently filed an application to expand its services into areas\r\n  served by an existing LEC, ALLTELL, based on the testimony of its\r\n  representative, Julie Patterson.Â  ALLTELL did not appear to contest the\r\n  application and the application was granted by order dated July 27, 2005.Â  \r\nTime Warner contends it was error to deny the\r\n  application in the proceeding here because the application in ALLTELL, which\r\n  was granted, incorporated the same testimony by Patterson given at the hearing\r\n  on the application here.Â  The record in this proceeding, however, is not\r\n  limited to Pattersonâ€™s testimony as it was in the uncontested ALLTELL\r\n  proceeding.Â  Here, the Rural LECs opposed the application based on testimony by\r\n  their expert witnesses.Â  These witnesses testified that allowing Time Warnerâ€™s\r\n  VoIP service would have an adverse impact on the affordability of rural\r\n  telephone service. Â Time Warnerâ€™s residential cable customers are located in\r\n  more densely populated areas and the company therefore would not be able to serve\r\n  the sparsely populated areas.Â  Rural LECs rely on revenue from the more densely\r\n  populated areas to maintain affordable rates for rural subscribers.Â  With the\r\n  loss of revenue from competition in densely populated areas, Rural LECs would\r\n  have to raise rates to rural subscribers who have no access to VoIP. \r\nIn light of this testimony, Time\r\n  Warnerâ€™s argument that the Commissionâ€™s order in ALLTELL compels the grant of\r\n  its application here is without merit.Â  The record in this case supports the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s decision since the record includes evidence that the proposed\r\n  expanded certification will adversely impact the availability of local exchange\r\n  service.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-9-280(B)(3) (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\n2.Â \r\nInterconnection agreements\r\nTime Warner contends the Commission\r\n  erred as a matter of law in holding that the company does not need\r\n  certification as an LEC to obtain interconnect agreements with existing LECs in\r\n  these areas.Â  The Commission held that Time Warner â€œmay enter into such\r\n  negotiations without further approval of this Commission.â€Â  \r\nState law provides for interconnect agreements\r\n  between certified LECs.Â  Section 58-9-280(C)(1) (Supp. 2006) provides:\r\n\r\n  The commission shall determine the\r\n    requirements applicable to all local telephone service providers necessary to\r\n    implement this subsection.Â  These requirements shall be consistent with\r\n    applicable federal law and shall:\r\n  (1) provide for the reasonable\r\n    interconnection of facilities between all certified local telephone\r\n    service providers upon a bona fide request for interconnection. . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nHere, the Commission ruled only\r\n  that certification is not required before negotiating for interconnect\r\n  agreements.Â  This ruling is not inconsistent with state law. Â Section\r\n  58-9-280(C)(1) provides that interconnect agreements may ultimately be approved only if between certified carriers.Â  No approval of interconnect agreements is\r\n  at issue here.Â  Under the Commissionâ€™s ruling, Time Warner therefore does not\r\n  need certification as an LEC at this time for its stated purpose of negotiating\r\n  interconnect agreements.Â Â  Since the Commissionâ€™s order gives Time Warner\r\n  permission to negotiate for interconnect agreements, there is no relief to be\r\n  granted on appeal.\r\n3.Â  Waiver of rural exemptions\r\nTime Warner complains the\r\n  Commission should not have based its ruling on the companyâ€™s failure to seek a\r\n  waiver of the Rural LECsâ€™ rural exemption under federal law.\r\nThe Commissionâ€™s order notes that\r\n  Time Warner was not seeking a waiver of the Rural LECsâ€™ rural exemption under\r\n  federal law.Â  This exemption provides that a rural company need not\r\n  interconnect until a bona fide request is received and the state commission\r\n  finds it is not economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and otherwise\r\n  complies with federal law.[4]Â \r\n  On rehearing, however, the Commission emphasized that the rural exemptions were\r\n  not dispositive of any of the issues in this proceeding.Â  Time Warnerâ€™s\r\n  argument is therefore without merit.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  order affirming the denial of Time Warnerâ€™s application is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]This company is a limited liability member of the Time\r\n  Warner, Inc., corporate family. \r\n[2]The Commission declined to rule on Time Warnerâ€™s\r\n  â€œmodified applicationâ€ and we do not address it here. \r\n[3]The rural exemption provides specific treatment for a\r\n  rural LEC and is found in 47 U.S.C. Â§ 251:\r\n\r\n  (f)(1)\r\n    Exemption for certain rural telephone companies\r\n  \r\n    (A) Exemption\r\n    Subsection (c) of this section [imposing certain duties including a\r\n      duty to interconnect] shall not apply to a rural telephone company until (i)\r\n      such company has received a bona fide request for interconnection, services, or\r\n      network elements, and (ii) the State commission determines . . . that such\r\n      request is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is\r\n      consistent with [other sections]. \r\n  \r\n\r\n[4]See footnote 3, supra. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26467","title":"Foothills Brewing Concern v.

Code Ann. Â§ 44-95-10 et seq. (2002).Â  The Clean Indoor Air Act provides that it is â€œunlawful for a person to smoke or possess lighted smoking\r\n  material in any formâ€ in various public indoor areas such as: Â (1) public\r\n  schools; (2) daycare centers; (3) health care facilities; (4) government\r\n  buildings; (5) elevators; (6) public transportation vehicles; and (7) public\r\n  performing art centers.Â  See Â§ 44-95-20.[1]Â \r\n  A violation of the Clean Indoor Air Act\r\n  constitutes a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, the violator â€œmust be fined not\r\nless than ten dollars nor more than twenty-five dollars.â€Â  Â§ 44-95-50.\r\nBecause of the reported dangers of\r\n  second-hand smoke, the City sought to more comprehensively regulate smoking in\r\n  public places. Therefore, on October 30, 2006, the City enacted Ordinance No.\r\n  2006-91 (the Ordinance).Â  In the â€œFindings and Determinationsâ€ section of the Ordinance,\r\nthe City stated as follows:\r\nNumerous studies have found that tobacco\r\n  smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing second\r\n  hand smoke â€¦ is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart\r\ndisease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancerâ€¦.\r\nThe City recognizes that smoke creates a\r\n  danger to the health and safety of the public at large and that, in order to\r\n  protect the health and welfare of the public, it is necessary to restrict\r\nsmoking in the manner provided for in this ordnance.\r\nThe Ordinance prohibits smoking in: Â (1) all\r\n  enclosed public places, including bars and restaurants; (2) places of\r\nemployment; and (3) certain outdoor areas, such as stadiums and zoos.Â   \r\nThe section of the Ordinance governing violations and\r\npenalties states as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tA person who smokes in an area \r\n\t\t\twhere smoking is prohibited by the provisions of this Ordinance \r\n\t\t\tshall be guilty\r\nof an infraction, punishable by a fine â€¦.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tB.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tA person who owns, manages, \r\n\t\t\toperates, or otherwise controls a public place or place of \r\n\t\t\temployment and who fails to comply with the provisions of this \r\n\t\t\tOrdinance shall be guilty of an\r\ninfraction, punishable by [a fine].\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tD. \r\n\t\t\tViolation of this Ordinance is \r\n\t\t\thereby declared to be a public nuisance.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nRespondents all own and operate restaurants and/or bars\r\n  in the City.Â  In December 2006, respondents filed a declaratory judgment action\r\n  contending the Ordinance was invalid and seeking injunctive relief.Â  The trial\r\n  court denied respondentsâ€™ requests for a temporary restraining order and a\r\n  preliminary injunction.Â  The Ordinance went into effect at noon on January 1,\r\n  2007.Â  On March 8, 2007, however, the trial court issued an order declaring the\r\n  Ordinance was both unconstitutional and preempted by State law.Â  Consequently,\r\nthe trial court permanently enjoined the City from enforcing the Ordinance.Â \r\n \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the trial court err in ruling that the\r\n  Ordinance is preempted by State law and violates the South Carolina\r\nConstitution?Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe City argues the Ordinance is not\r\n  preempted by State law and is consistent\r\nwith both the Constitution and the general law of the State.Â  We agree.\r\nA two-step process is used to determine whether a\r\n  local ordinance is valid. Â Denene, Inc. v. City of\r\n    Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 212, 574 S.E.2d 196, 198&nbsp;(2002); Bugsyâ€™s\r\n      v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 87, 93, 530 S.E.2d 890, 893\r\n  (2000).Â  First, the Court must consider whether the municipality had the power\r\n  to enact the ordinance.Â  If the State has preempted a particular area of\r\n  legislation, a municipality lacks power to regulate the field, and the ordinance\r\n  is invalid.Â  Id.Â  If, however, the municipality had the power to enact\r\n  the ordinance, the Court must then determine whether the ordinance is\r\n  consistent with the Constitution and the general law of the State.Â  Id.\r\nTo preempt an entire field, â€œan act must make manifest\r\n  a legislative intent that no other enactment may touch upon the subject in any\r\n  way.â€Â  Bugsyâ€™s, 340 S.C. at 94, 530 S.E.2d at 893&nbsp;(citing Town\r\n    of Hilton Head Island v. Fine Liquors, Ltd., 302 S.C. 550, 397 S.E.2d 662\r\n  (1990)).Â  Furthermore, â€œfor there to be a conflict between a state statute and\r\n  a municipal ordinance â€˜both must contain either express or implied conditions\r\n  which are inconsistent or irreconcilable with each otherâ€¦. Â If either is silent\r\n  where the other speaks, there can be no conflict between them.Â  Where no\r\n  conflict exists, both laws stand.â€™â€Â  Town of Hilton Head Island v. Fine\r\n    Liquors, Ltd., 302 S.C. at 553, 397 S.E.2d at 664&nbsp;(quoting McAbee\r\nv. Southern Rwy., Co., 166 S.C. 166, 169-70, 164 S.E. 444, 445 (1932)). Â \r\nIn the instant case, the trial court found\r\n  that a 1996 legislative act - Act 445 -\r\nexpressly preempts the Ordinance.Â  We find no preemption.\r\nAct 445 accomplished two separate objectives:Â  (1) it amended section 44-95-20 of the Clean Indoor Air Act;[2] and (2) it amended and added statutes\r\n  related to the distribution of tobacco products to minors.Â  See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§Â§ 16-17-500 thru -504 (2003).Â   \r\nSection 16-17-500 is a criminal statute\r\n  which makes it a misdemeanor for anyone to sell or give a tobacco product to a\r\n  minor. Â Section 3 of Act 445 amended this section by revising the penalties for\r\n  the offense. Â Section 2 of Act 445 added sections 16-17-501, 16-17-502, 16-17-503,\r\n  and 16-17-504 to the Code.Â  Section 16-17-501 provides definitions relating to the\r\n  distribution of tobacco products; section 16-17-502 makes it unlawful to\r\n  distribute a tobacco sample to a minor; and section 16-17-503 provides for\r\nenforcement and federal reporting.\r\nSection 16-17-504, entitled â€œImplementation; local\r\nlaws,â€ provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\t(A)\r\n  Sections 16-17-500, 16-17-502, and 16-17-503 must be implemented in an\r\n  equitable and uniform manner throughout the State and enforced to ensure the\r\n  eligibility for and receipt of federal funds or grants the State receives or\r\n  may receive relating to the sections.Â  Any laws, ordinances, or rules\r\n    enacted pertaining to tobacco products may not supersede state law or\r\n    regulation.Â  Nothing herein shall affect the right of any person having\r\n  ownership or otherwise controlling private property to allow or prohibit the use\r\nof tobacco products on such property.\r\n\t(B) Smoking\r\n  ordinances in effect before the effective date of this act are exempt from the\r\nrequirements of subsection (A).\r\n\r\nÂ§ 16-17-504 (emphasis added).\r\nThe trial court found that the second\r\n  sentence of section 16-17-504(A) (emphasized above) applies not only to the statutory\r\n  sections regarding the furnishing of tobacco to minors, but also applies to the\r\n  Clean Indoor Air Act.Â  The trial court therefore determined that this portion\r\n  of section 16-17-504(A) expressly preempts local ordinances such as the\r\n  Ordinance passed by the City in 2006.Â  The trial court concluded that by\r\n  â€œincluding the second sentence in section 16-17-504(A), the General Assembly\r\n  intended to prohibit local government from imposing any restriction on indoor\r\nsmoking beyond the restrictions contained in the Clean Indoor Air Act.â€Â   \r\nThe City contends that the sections of Act\r\n  445 dealing with the distribution of tobacco products to minors were intended\r\n  to address prerequisites set by the federal government in order to be eligible\r\n  for certain grant funds.Â  See, e.g., Â§ 16-17-503 (specifically\r\n  referencing compliance with the federal Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  300x-26).Â  Because of the limited focus and purpose of these statutes, the City\r\n  argues the trial court erred by essentially exporting a portion of section\r\n16-17-504 over to the Clean Indoor Air Act.Â  We agree with the City.\r\nThe primary rule of statutory construction is to\r\n  ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.Â  E.g., Hodges\r\n    v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581&nbsp;(2000).Â  When\r\n  construing statutory language, the statute must be read as a whole, and\r\n  sections which are part of the same general statutory law must be construed\r\n  together and each one given effect.Â  Denene, 352 S.C. at 212, 574 S.E.2d\r\n  at198; TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611,\r\n  503 S.E.2d 471 (1998).Â  Moreover, â€œ[a] statute should not be construed by\r\n  concentrating on an isolated phrase.â€Â  South Carolina State Ports Auth. v. Jasper County, 368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629&nbsp;(2006).Â  Finally, the Court\r\n  must presume the Legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather intended\r\nits statutes to accomplish something.Â  Denene, supra.\r\nWe find the trial court erred when it isolated a\r\n  phrase from section 16-17-504 and interpreted it in such a way as to accomplish\r\n  preemption under the Clean Indoor Air Act.Â  See South Carolina State Ports Auth., supra (statute should not be construed by concentrating on an isolated\r\n  phrase).Â  While sections which are part of the same general\r\n  statutory law must be construed together and each one given effect, see Denene, supra, this is easily accomplished by looking at the plain language in\r\n  section 16-17-504 and applying it only to sections 16-17-500, 16-17-502, and\r\n  16-17-503.Â  To apply section 16-17-504 more broadly than that would effectively\r\n  change the meaning of an unambiguous statute, which we refuse to do.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey,&nbsp;341 S.C. at 85, 533 S.E.2d at 581 (â€œUnder the plain meaning rule, it is not the courtâ€™s place\r\nto change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.â€).\r\nIn other words, it is patent that the language\r\n  regarding â€œordinancesâ€ found in section 16-17-504 is intended to relate\r\n  specifically to the distribution of â€œtobacco productsâ€ to minors, and not to the\r\n  regulation of indoor smoking.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, supra (the cardinal\r\n  rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\n  Legislature).Â  Merely because section 16-17-504 was added to the Code in the\r\n  same piece of legislation which amended the Clean Indoor Air Act does not\r\n  require that this sectionâ€™s language about local laws be interpreted as part of\r\nthe Clean Indoor Air Act.Â   \r\nAccordingly, the trial court erred in deciding that\r\nAct 445 expressly preempts the Ordinance.\r\nMoreover, we note the Clean Indoor Air Act did not\r\n  preempt the entire field of indoor smoking.Â  There simply is no expressly stated intent in the statute that the State chose to exclusively regulate the\r\n  subject of indoor smoking.Â  See Bugsyâ€™s, 340 S.C. at 94, 530\r\n  S.E.2d at 893&nbsp;(to accomplish field preemption, â€œan act must make manifest\r\n  a legislative intent that no other enactment may touch upon the subject in any\r\nwayâ€).[3]Â   \r\nBecause Act 445 and the Clean Indoor Air Act itself do\r\n  not preempt the City from legislating in this area, we find the City had the\r\n  power to enact the Ordinance.Â  Thus, the Ordinance survives step one of the\r\n  analysis.Â  See Denene, supra; Bugsyâ€™s, supra.Â \r\n  Next, under step two, we must determine whether the Ordinance is consistent\r\nwith the Constitution and the general law of the State.Â  Id.\r\nThe trial court found the Ordinance violated Article\r\n  VIII, section 14 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Specifically, the trial court stated that because a violation of the\r\n  Clean Indoor Air Act constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, and the\r\n  Ordinance provides for a fine for smoking in areas not prohibited by the State\r\n  law, the City unconstitutionally â€œcriminalized conduct that is not illegal\r\n  under State criminal laws governing the same subject.â€Â  Because we find the\r\n  Ordinance does not criminalize conduct, we hold it does not run afoul of\r\nArticle VIII, section 14 of the Constitution.\r\nAlthough Article VIII deals generally with the creation of local government, Article VIII, section\r\n  14 limits certain powers of local governments. Â See City of North Charleston v. Harper,&nbsp;306 S.C. 153, 155-56, 410 S.E.2d 569, 570&nbsp;(1991).\r\n  Â Section 14 provides, in pertinent part:Â  â€œIn\r\n  enacting provisions required or authorized by this article, general law\r\n  provisions applicable to the following matters shall not be set aside: Â â€¦(5)\r\n  criminal laws and the penalties and sanctions for the transgression thereof.â€Â  S.C.\r\nConst., art. VIII, Â§ 14. Â \r\nWe have observed that this subsection of the\r\n  Constitution requires â€œstatewide uniformityâ€ regarding the criminal law of this\r\n  State, and therefore, â€œlocal governments may not criminalize conduct\r\n  that is legal under a statewide criminal law.â€Â  Martin v. Condon, 324\r\n  S.C. 183, 478 S.E.2d 272, 274&nbsp;(1996) (emphasis added); accord Connor\r\n    v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 314 S.C. 251, 442 S.E.2d 608 (1994) (where\r\n  the Court held that a municipality cannot criminalize nude dancing when State\r\nlaw does not).  \r\nWhile the Ordinance in this case does make smoking in\r\n  certain areas â€œunlawfulâ€ where the Clean Indoor Air Act does not, it is our opinion\r\n  the Ordinance does not criminalize such behavior.Â  Instead, the Ordinance\r\n  states that a violation constitutes â€œan infraction.â€Â  â€œInfractionâ€ is defined\r\nas:  \r\n\r\n\tA breach, violation, or infringement; as of a law, a\r\n  contract, a right or a duty.Â  A violation of a statute for which the only\r\n  sentence authorized is a fine and which violation is expressly designated as an\r\ninfraction.\r\n\r\nBlackâ€™s\r\nLaw Dictionary 537 (6th ed. 1992). Â \r\nPut simply, the plain language of the Ordinance is\r\n  non-criminal in nature.Â  This contrasts\r\n  with the Clean Indoor Air Actâ€™s â€œmisdemeanorâ€ language which clearly indicates that\r\na violation of the State law is considered a criminal offense.\r\nCiting Connor v. Town of Hilton Head Island, supra, respondents argue this Court has held that a local ordinance\r\n  cannot make an activity illegal when it is otherwise legal under State law.Â \r\n  They contend that based on this holding, the Ordinance must be struck down.Â  In Connor, we stated that Article VIII, section 14 â€œprohibit[s] a\r\n  municipality from proscribing conduct that is not unlawful under State criminal\r\n  laws governing the same subject.â€Â  314 S.C. at 254, 442 S.E.2d at 609.Â  It was\r\n  clear, however, that the local ordinance at issue in Connor, which\r\n  prohibited nude or semi-nude dancing, criminalized such conduct.Â  In support of\r\n  our holding, we stated as follows:Â  â€œSince Town has criminalized conduct\r\n  that is not unlawful under relevant State law, we conclude Town exceeded its\r\n  power in enacting the ordinance in question.â€Â  Id. at 254, 442 S.E.2d at\r\n610.Â   \r\nIn the instant case, however, where the violation of\r\n  the Ordinance constitutes an infraction or a public nuisance, the conclusion is\r\n  inescapable that the City does not seek to criminalize any conduct.Â  As such,\r\n  the Ordinance does not â€œset asideâ€ the criminal laws of this State.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find trial court erred in finding that the Ordinance violates Article VIII,\r\nsection 14 of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\nFinally, we hold the Ordinance is consistent with the\r\nConstitution and the general law of the State.\r\nSouth Carolina law\r\nprovides that each municipality of this State may enact:\r\n\r\n\tregulations, resolutions, and ordinances, not\r\n  inconsistent with the Constitution and general law of this State, including the\r\n  exercise of powers in relation to roads, streets, markets, law enforcement,\r\n  health, and order in the municipality or respecting any subject which appears\r\n  to it necessary and proper for the security, general welfare, and convenience\r\n  of the municipality or for preserving health, peace, order, and good government\r\nin it.â€\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (2004).Â  Under the State Constitution, â€œall laws concerning\r\n  local government shall be liberally construed in their favor.â€Â  S.C. Const. art.\r\n  VIII, Â§ 17.Â  â€œA municipal ordinance is a legislative enactment and is presumed\r\n  to be constitutional.â€Â  Sunset Cay, LLC v. City of Folly Beach,&nbsp;357 S.C. 414, 425, 593 S.E.2d 462, 467&nbsp;(2004).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]s a\r\n  general rule, â€˜additional regulation to that of State law does not constitute a\r\n  conflict therewith.â€™â€Â  Denene, 352 S.C. at 214, 574 S.E.2d at 199\r\n(citation omitted).\r\nThe City claims that the Ordinance is a proper\r\n  exercise of municipal power because it seeks to protect citizens from\r\n  second-hand smoke.Â  See Â§ 5-7-30 (municipality may enact ordinance which\r\npromotes general welfare and preserves health).Â  We agree.\r\nIn Denene, this Court found that a local\r\n  ordinance which prohibited commercial establishments\r\n  that allow alcohol consumption from operating between the hours of 2 a.m. and 6\r\n  a.m. on Mondays through Saturdays did not conflict with State law which\r\n  prohibited the sale of alcohol between twelve\r\n  oâ€™clock Saturday night and sunrise Monday morning.Â  The Denene Court held that because the local ordinance was â€œneither inconsistent nor\r\n  irreconcilableâ€ with the State statute, it was a proper and valid exercise of\r\nthe cityâ€™s police power.Â  Denene, 352 S.C. at 215, 574 S.E.2d at 199.\r\nThe situation in the instant case is akin to that in Denene.Â \r\n  While the State has legislated restrictions on smoking in certain areas, a\r\n  civil ordinance which adds areas does not in any way conflict with the State\r\n  law.Â  â€œMere differences in detail do not render [statutes] conflicting.Â  If\r\n  either is silent where the other speaks, there can be no conflict between\r\n  them.Â  Where no conflict exists, both laws stand.â€Â  Town of Hilton Head\r\n    Island v. Fine Liquors, Ltd., 302 S.C. at 553, 397 S.E.2d at 664 (internal\r\nquotes and citation omitted).\r\nThus, it is our opinion that the Ordinance is\r\nconsistent with the Constitution and the general law of the State.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, we hold the Ordinance\r\n  passed by the City is valid and enforceable.Â  Therefore, we reverse the trial\r\ncourtâ€™s order.  \r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Some exceptions are allowed under the Clean Indoor Air Act such as designated smoking\r\n  areas in employee break areas and private offices. See Â§ 44-95-20.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the statute expressly permits certain expansions in the delineated\r\n  categories; for example, the statute does not prohibit:Â  (1) school districts\r\n  from providing for a smoke-free campus; or (2) health care facilities from\r\nbeing smoke-free. Â Id.Â   \r\n[2] According to the title of\r\n  Act 445, the amendment to the Clean Indoor Air Act was â€œto revise the areas in\r\n  which a person may smoke in public schools and provide that local school boards\r\nmay make school district facilities smoke free.â€\r\n[3] We are aware that several opinions of the Attorney\r\n  General have come to a different conclusion, and respondents urge us to adopt the\r\n  Attorney Generalâ€™s view of this issue.Â  See Op. S.C. Attâ€™y Gen., 2007 WL\r\n  1651346 (May 1, 2007); Op. S.C. Attâ€™y Gen., 2006 WL 269614 (Jan. 26, 2006);\r\n  1990 Op. S.C. Attâ€™y Gen. 196 (1990).Â  The 1990 opinion reviewed whether the\r\n  Clean Indoor Air Act preempted localities from further regulating smoking and\r\n  found that â€œlocal political subdivisions would be prohibited, at least\r\n    implicitly, from further regulation of smoking in public indoor places.â€Â  (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Under this Courtâ€™s law, however, preemption must be explicit, not\r\n  implicit.
