Zelenka, and Solicitor Warren\r\nB. Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  Michael Saltz (appellant) appeals his conviction for murder.  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nAppellant was convicted of the murder of twelve-year-old Joseph Barefoot.  Joseph disappeared on Sunday, May 25, 1997.  As part of an extensive search for the\r\nmissing boy, fliers were distributed throughout the community.  The fliers described Joseph and indicated he was last seen in a white Chevy truck with a white male, aged\r\nfifteen to nineteen, named Mikey.  It was inaccurate to state Joseph was \"last seen\" in the described truck.  Two different witnesses described speaking to Joseph on\r\nSunday afternoon, when he was out riding his bicycle.  However, investigators later confirmed that seventeen-year-old Michael Saltz had given Joseph and his friend\r\nCharlie Mengedoht a ride in his white Chevy truck on Saturday, the day prior to Joseph's disappearance.  \r\n\r\nBecause of his description on the missing person flier, appellant was the brunt of considerable teasing during the summer of 1997, while Joseph remained missing. \r\nAppellant reportedly \"bragged\" about killing Joseph to a number of his teenage friends, in what he describes in his brief to this Court as an \"irrational[] and self-destructiv[e]\" reaction \"to being cast as prime suspect in a highly publicized case.\"  There was testimony appellant said he \"did it\" \"to get everybody off his back.\"  \r\n\r\nOn September 16, 1997, Joseph's skeletal remains were discovered in a heavily wooded area behind the golf course near Starling Goodson Road.  Within days of the\r\ndiscovery of Joseph's remains, three of appellant's friends - Sydney Johnston, Selina Welch, and Todd Ledford - all provided sworn statements to police implicating\r\nappellant.  Appellant was brought in for questioning and eventually confessed to the murder.  Appellant's seven consecutive statements are highly contradictory, (1) and the\r\nfinal statement, in which he incriminates only himself, is factually improbable.  However, some details included in appellant's statements are consistent with evidence\r\ndiscovered at the crime scene.  Most significantly, appellant stated he tied Joseph to a tree with a black nylon cord.  A black nylon cord was found tied around a tree\r\nwhere Joseph's bones were found.  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Did the trial court erroneously rule on the admission of prior consistent statements?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA.  Statement of Sydney Johnston \r\n\r\nB.  Statement of Tina Ashford\r\n\r\n  \r\nII.  Did the trial court erroneously admit irrelevant evidence?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA.  Appellant's school attendance record\r\n\r\nB.  Witness's feelings\r\n\r\n  \r\nIII.  Did the trial court err in limiting appellant's cross-examination of a witness for credibility and bias?\r\n\r\nIV.  Did the trial court err in admitting appellant's statements as voluntary? \r\n\r\nV.  Did the trial court err in denying appellant's motion for a directed verdict?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI.  Prior consistent statements \r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court twice erred in ruling on the admissibility of prior consistent statements of witnesses.  In the first instance, appellant asserts the trial court\r\nerroneously permitted hearsay to bolster a prosecution witness's testimony.  In the second instance, appellant asserts the trial court erroneously refused to admit testimony\r\nconcerning a prior consistent statement of a defense witness.  We agree the court erred in both instances. \r\n\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.  State\r\nv. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995). \r\n\r\nPrior consistent statements of a witness are not inadmissible hearsay if\r\n\r\nThe declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is  . . . consistent with the declarant's\r\ntestimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive;  provided, however, the\r\nstatement must have been made before the alleged fabrication, or before the alleged improper influence or motive arose.\r\n\r\nRule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE.  Thus, in order for a prior consistent statement to be admissible pursuant to this rule, the following elements must be present:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the declarant must testify and be subject to cross-examination,\r\n\r\n(2) the opposing party must have explicitly or implicitly accused the declarant of recently fabricating the statement or of acting under an improper influence or motive,\r\n\r\n(3) the statement must be consistent with the declarant's testimony, and\r\n\r\n(4) the statement must have been made prior to the alleged fabrication, or prior to the existence of the alleged improper influence or motive.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Sydney Johnston/Jan Kopel\r\n\r\nAppellant first argues the trial court erred in permitting Jan Kopel to testify concerning a prior consistent statement made by Sydney Johnston.  \r\n\r\nSydney testified that appellant stated, \"I killed Joseph Barefoot.\" On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Sydney as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Do you recall telling me that the first thing he said was, \"I really didn't do it\"?  Do you recall?\r\n\r\nWitness: No, I didn't say that.\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: You don't recall saying that?\r\n\r\nWitness: No, I don't.\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Do you recall telling me that when he finally said, \"I did it,\" you used the word \"sarcastically\"?  Do you recall that?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.  And my version of \"sarcastically\" is kind of bragging, kind of, I don't want to say vain because that's - but it's bragging.\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Okay, but you don't recall saying that the first thing he said was, \"I really didn't do\"? [sic].\r\n\r\nWitness: Right.\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: You don't recall that part?\r\n\r\nWitness: No.\r\n\r\n. . . . \r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Well, do you recall saying to me at that time with everyone else present, not using the words that he said, \"I killed him,\" but he said, \"Yeah, I did it,\" as\r\nopposed to, \"I killed him\"?  Do you recall making that statement?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes, I do, to you.  And the more that I've been able to go back and look over everything, it was a \"Yeah, I killed him\" thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver appellant's objection, the trial court permitted Kopel to testify concerning the following conversation, which took place between Kopel and Sydney the day after\r\nJoseph's remains were found: \r\n\r\nShe [Sydney] said that - they call him \"JoJo\" Barefoot or this child, \"JoJo,\" had been found and that someone named Mikey had told her a while back - she didn't say\r\nexactly when - but he had killed this child that was missing.  And she didn't know about anybody being missing or no bones had been found or body had been found or\r\nanything.  And so she just kind of didn't know whether to believe him or not and was feeling guilty because she felt like maybe if she had come forward sooner that they\r\nmay have found him.\r\n\r\nAppellant argued to the trial court, and now argues on appeal, that Kopel's testimony was improperly permitted to bolster Sydney's testimony.  Appellant argues that\r\nRule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE, is inapplicable in this instance because he very deliberately did not suggest that Sydney had recently fabricated her testimony or was acting\r\nunder an improper influence or motive.  On the contrary, appellant asserts, his cross-examination was very carefully restricted to whether or not Sydney's trial testimony\r\nwas consistent with a statement she had made to defense counsel and his investigator shortly before trial.  The trial court ruled that defense counsel's cross-examination\r\nplaced Sydney's credibility before the jury, and thus Rule 801 permitted the State to offer a prior consistent statement.  Thus, the precise issue here is whether questioning\r\nthe witness concerning a prior inconsistent statement invokes Rule 801(d)(1)(B).  We conclude it does not. \r\n\r\nUnder the common law in South Carolina, proof of a prior consistent statement was admissible to rehabilitate a witness who had been impeached with a prior inconsistent\r\nstatement.  See, e.g., Burns v. Clayton, 237 S.C. 316, 336-37, 117 S.E.2d 300, 310 (1960) (\"Where the credit of a witness has been impeached by proof or imputation\r\nthat he has made declarations inconsistent with what he has sworn to, an exception to the hearsay rule permits proof of his declarations, consistent with what he has sworn\r\nto, made on other occasions prior to the existence of his relation to the cause.\").   The State relies on these pre-SCRE cases.  Rule 801(d)(1)(B) changed this rule.  The\r\nplain language of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) only permits evidence of a prior consistent statement when the witness has been charged with recent fabrication or improper motive\r\nor influence.  Although questioning a witness about a prior inconsistent statement does call the witness's credibility into question, that is not the same as charging the\r\nwitness with \"recent fabrication\" or \"improper influence or motive.\"  Cf. Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 157 (1995) (\"Prior consistent statements may not be\r\nadmitted to counter all forms of impeachment or to bolster the witness merely because she has been discredited. . . .  The rule speaks of a party rebutting an alleged\r\nmotive, not bolstering the veracity of the story told.\").  Appellant questioned the accuracy of the witness's memory; he did not charge her with recent fabrication or\r\nimproper influence or motive.  The State should not have been permitted to introduce hearsay testimony of Sydney's prior consistent statement because appellant's cross-examination of Sydney did not imply recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.  The trial court's admission of the testimony pursuant to former evidentiary rules\r\nconstituted an error of law amounting to an abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the error was not harmless.  Erroneously admitted corroboration testimony is not harmless merely because it is cumulative.  On the contrary, \"it is precisely this\r\ncumulative effect which enhances the devastating impact of improper corroboration.\"  Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17, 21, 443 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1994).  Here, Sydney's\r\ntestimony was weak and not particularly credible, (2) and the improper corroboration could not have been harmless. \r\n\r\nB.  Tina Ashford/Buddy Hancock \r\n\r\nAppellant next argues the trial court erred in refusing to allow Buddy Hancock to testify concerning a prior consistent statement made by Tina Ashford, a defense witness. \r\nThis issue involves a different aspect of Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE.\r\n\r\nCharlie Mengedoht testified for the prosecution.  On cross-examination, appellant was permitted to attempt to impeach Charlie by asking him about a statement he had\r\nallegedly made to Tina Ashford implicating himself in Joseph's death: \r\n\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Did you make a statement at that time that you and others put a bag over Joseph's head, beat him and kicked him.  He cried and whimpered and tried\r\nto crawl away but could not, and that you left the body in the woods behind the golf course behind Starling Goodson Road and that you went back several times to view\r\nthe body?\r\n\r\nWitness: No, I don't recall saying that.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statement did not qualify as admissible evidence of third party guilt; thus, the questions were permitted for impeachment purposes only, and the jury was so instructed. \r\nOn re-direct, Charlie testified that Tina was appellant's girlfriend, but had once been his (Charlie's) friend.  \r\n\r\nDuring the defense case, Tina testified that in the summer of 1997, Charlie told her he and unidentified accomplices killed Joseph as described above.  This testimony was\r\nconsistent with an affidavit Tina had signed on February 23, 1999.  On cross-examination, Tina admitted appellant was her boyfriend of four months.  However, she\r\ntestified she did not know appellant in the summer of 1997.  The solicitor asked Tina:\r\n\r\nSo thirteen days before the jury is going to be deciding Michael Saltz's, whether he's guilty or innocent of this crime, thirteen days prior to that jury being selected you go\r\ninto your boyfriend that you love's lawyer's office and sign an affidavit indicating somebody else might have been involved in this incident that happened two years ago?\r\n\r\nWhen asked why she did not contact the police right away, Tina testified that she told her father about Charlie's statement, and her father contacted the police. \r\n\r\nThe defense then called Buddy Hancock, Tina's father.  After a discussion of Rule 801(d), the State additionally objected to Hancock testifying because he had been\r\npresent in the courtroom during his daughter's testimony.  The trial court permitted the defense to proffer Hancock's testimony prior to the court ruling on its admissibility. \r\nHancock testified in camera that Tina came to him in the summer of 1997 and told him what Charlie allegedly told her concerning Joseph's death.  However, when asked\r\nwhether he contacted the police concerning the statement, Hancock testified:\r\n\r\n\r\nWitness:  I told [the police] the little boy, what I heard all around lower Richland there, the little boy was run away from home and he was out in the woods and he was\r\ngoing down to Food Lion, was out in the woods behind Food Lion, going in the Food Lion getting food, sneaking food out of there, going back in the woods.\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Did you tell them anything about Charlie Mengedoht?\r\n\r\nWitness: I told them Charles was - Charles was - at the time, what I hear around there, Charles was taking him food because he was hiding him out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court refused to permit Hancock to testify before the jury, but did not state a reason. \r\n\r\nThis line of questioning is precisely what Rule 801(d)(1)(B) was designed to address.  The Solicitor's questions charged the witness with both recent fabrication (coming\r\nforward thirteen days before trial) and improper motive (her romantic relationship with defendant).  Thus, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) permits appellant to offer evidence of a prior\r\nconsistent statement made before the alleged fabrication or improper motive arose.  The issue here is thus whether the trial court could, in its discretion, nevertheless\r\nexclude corroborating testimony for other reasons.  Although the judge did not give a reason for his ruling, the State offers two reasons why it was within the court's\r\ndiscretion to disallow the testimony.  We may affirm for any reason appearing in the record.  Rule 220(c),\r\nSCACR.  \r\n\r\nFirst, the State asserts Hancock's testimony was tainted by his \"apparent violation\" of the sequestration order (emphasis added).  The decision whether to waive a\r\nsequestration order for witnesses present during the trial rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge.  State v. Cabbagestalk, 281 S.C. 35, 314 S.E.2d 10 (1984). \r\nAlthough it may have been within the trial court's discretion to disallow Hancock's testimony if Hancock had violated the sequestration order, the record is insufficient to\r\nsupport such a finding.  Second, the State asserts Hancock's testimony could \"possibly lead to unfair prejudice, confusing of the issues [sic]\" under Rule 403, SCRE.  We\r\ndo not see any basis for excluding Hancock's testimony under Rule 403.  Appellant should have been allowed to answer the State's charge of recent fabrication and\r\nimproper motive.  Since we have already ruled appellant is entitled to a new trial, we need not conduct a harmless error analysis.  \r\n\r\nII.  Irrelevant evidence\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in admitting irrelevant evidence on two occasions, each of which will be discussed in turn. \r\n\r\nOnly relevant evidence is admissible.  Rule 402, SCRE.  \"'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Rule 401, SCRE.  Even if evidence is relevant, it\r\n\"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of\r\nundue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"  Rule 403, SCRE.  Unfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an\r\nimproper basis, such as an emotional one.  State v. Kelly, Op. No. 25226 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 8, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1 at p.13, 17).  The trial court is\r\ngiven broad discretion in ruling on questions concerning the relevancy of evidence, and its decision will be reversed only if there is a clear abuse of discretion.  Id.\r\n\r\n      A.  Appellant's attendance record\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court abused its discretion in admitting his school attendance record.  We agree.  \r\n\r\nOver appellant's objection, the court allowed the records custodian of Richland County School District One to testify that appellant was absent from school without an\r\nexcuse on Thursday, May 29, 1997.  The fact appellant was absent from school on Thursday, May 29, 1997 did not tend to make \"the existence of any fact that is of\r\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  See Rule 401, SCRE.  Joseph was last seen on\r\nSunday, May 25, 1997.  His body was found on September 16, 1997.  The State asserts the evidence was relevant, although admittedly of \"little probative value,\"\r\nbecause it \"reveal[ed] that [appellant's] whereabouts on that date were [as] unknown as [Joseph's].\"  However, the State presented no evidence Thursday, May 29,\r\n1997 had any consequence to this case.  On the contrary, introduction of this irrelevant evidence encouraged the jury to speculate that Thursday, May 29, 1997 must be\r\nsignificant to the case in some way unknown to them.  Moreover, admission of this irrelevant evidence served to portray appellant as a delinquent.  Even if the evidence\r\nwere marginally relevant, it unfairly prejudiced appellant, confused the issues, and misled the jury, and therefore should have been excluded. \r\n\r\nB.  Testimony of Shasta Mengedoht\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court abused its discretion in admitting irrelevant testimony of Shasta Mengedoht concerning her feelings.  We agree.\r\n\r\nMengedoht was close friends with Jackie Barefoot, Joseph's mother, and she was also the mother of Charlie Mengedoht, Joseph's friend.  She testified for the\r\nprosecution.  Defense witnesses had testified that Joseph was seen playing in the Mengedohts' yard after the time of his disappearance.  In reply, the State called\r\nMengedoht.  The following colloquy took place:\r\n\r\n\r\nSolicitor: Are you aware that there has been inferences made that Joseph Barefoot was at your house in June and July of 1997?\r\n\r\nWitness: I was only made aware of that last night.\r\n\r\nSolicitor: How does that make you feel?\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Objection, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Overruled.\r\n\r\nWitness: Well, it's really sad.  You know, Jackie and I, we've watched a lot of sunsets together.  And every time - \r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Your Honor, I think this is not relevant.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Wait a minute.  Sir?\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: This is not relevant, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nSolicitor: He's making the inference, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Yes, sir.  I'm going to allow her to testify.\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: I mean, I understand that - the bottom line is that how that makes her feel is not relevant to any issue in this case.  It doesn't affect credibility.  It doesn't\r\naffect any issue in this case.\r\n\r\nThe Court: Your objection is overruled.  You may answer the question.\r\n\r\nWitness: As I was saying, we had watched a lot of sunsets together, and each time I would say, \"God, I hope Joe can see this too,\" and find some kind of comfort and\r\nknow that we would not give up and that we loved him.  It's just sad that we have to sit here now.  And I was - \r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Objection, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nThe Court: All right, thank you ma'am.  That's enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court abused its discretion in allowing this testimony over appellant's repeated objections.  The witness's thoughts and feelings did not make the existence of any\r\nfact of consequence to the case more or less probable.  On the contrary, the testimony only served \"to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury.\"  Cf. State v.\r\nLangley, 334 S.C. 633, 647, 515 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1999) (a photograph should be excluded if it is calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury or is\r\nirrelevant or unnecessary to substantiate facts).  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we address the State's contention that this error is unpreserved because appellant did not move to strike the testimony.  The requirement that a party move\r\nto strike objectionable testimony applies when an objection has been sustained.  See State v. Wingo, 304 S.C. 173, 177-78, 403 S.E.2d 322, 325 (Ct. App. 1991) (a\r\nmotion to strike is necessary where a question is answered before an objection thereto has been interposed, even though the objection is sustained) (citing 88 C.J.S. Trial\r\nÂ§ 133, at 268 (1955)).  Here, the trial court never sustained any of appellant's objections.  Therefore, no additional action was required of appellant to preserve this issue\r\nfor appellate review.  \r\n\r\nIII.  Cross-examination\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in limiting his cross-examination of Shasta Mengedoht for credibility and bias and that such limitation violated his constitutional right\r\nto confront the witnesses against him.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nAs discussed above, Mengedoht was Charlie's mother and Jackie Barefoot's friend.  Appellant sought to cross-examine Mengedoht concerning her respective loyalties to\r\nher son and her friend, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: I understand Jackie Barefoot is your friend.  Correct?\r\n\r\nA.  Yes, she is.\r\n\r\nQ.  And I understand you're extremely loyal to her?\r\n\r\nA.  Yes, I am.\r\n\r\nQ.  And Charlie is your son?\r\n\r\nA.  Yes.\r\n\r\nQ.  And, ma'am, if you had to make a choice and there was no middle ground - \r\n\r\nSolicitor: Objection to this.  I know where he's going.  I object.  We need to approach the bench.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury was excused and the following bench conference took place:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court: All right, sir.  What is the question you want to ask?\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: Very simple, Your Honor.  I want to be allowed to ask the witness that if she had to make a choice between being loyal to her friend and protecting her\r\nson, what would it be?  That's all.  It's a credibility question.  It doesn't go to third party guilt.  I [sic] not arguing third party guilt, Judge.\r\n\r\nThe Court: No, sir.  She hasn't testified about her son at all.  She was called back in reply testimony to rebut your testimony that the victim was playing football in her yard\r\nthree weeks after he was missing.  And I'm not going to let you go back now and start bringing in something else about her son being accused of this crime.  That's totally\r\nirrelevant.\r\n\r\nDefense Counsel: He's not being accused, Your Honor.  What was irrelevant was her testimony about how it made her feel to listen to the other testimony.  I was not\r\nasking her about her son being accused.  I've never accused him, Your Honor.  The witnesses place him - \r\n\r\nThe Court: Your objection is overruled [sic].  Sit down.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right to a meaningful cross-examination of an adverse witness is included in the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers.  State v. Aleksey, 343\r\nS.C. 20, 33, 538 S.E.2d 248, 255 (2000).  This does not mean, however, that trial courts conducting criminal trials lose their usual discretion to limit the scope of\r\ncross-examination.  Id.; see also State v. Lynn, 277 S.C. 222, 284 S.E.2d 786 (1981) (a trial court's ruling concerning the scope of cross-examination of a witness to\r\ntest his credibility should not be disturbed on appeal absent a manifest abuse of discretion).  On the contrary, \"trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation\r\nClause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues,\r\nwitness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\"  Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986).\r\n\r\nIn Van Arsdall, the United States Supreme Court held \"a criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from\r\nengaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby 'to expose the jury to the facts\r\nfrom which jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to reliability of the witness.'\"  Id. at 680 (emphasis added) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308,\r\n318 (1974)).  However, this Court has cautioned the bench that \"before a criminal defendant can be prohibited from engaging in [such cross-examination] . . ., the record\r\nmust clearly show that the cross-examination is somehow inappropriate.\"  State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385-86, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994).\r\n\r\nThe first question, therefore, is whether the proposed cross-examination was inappropriate.  A witness may be impeached with evidence of \"[b]ias, prejudice or any\r\nmotive to misrepresent.\"  Rule 608(c), SCRE.  We recently held this rule \"preserves South Carolina precedent holding that generally, 'anything having a legitimate\r\ntendency to throw light on the accuracy, truthfulness, and sincerity of a witness may be shown and considered in determining the credit to be accorded his testimony.'\" \r\nState v. Jones, Op. No. 25242 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 24, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No.4, at p.48) (quoting State v. Brewington, 267 S.C. 97, 101, 226 S.E.2d\r\n249, 250 (1976)).  \"On cross-examination, any fact may be elicited which tends to show interest, bias, or partiality of the witness.\"  State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 325,\r\n531 S.E.2d 907, 914-15 (2000) (emphasis added) (also quoting Brewington, 267 S.C. at 101, 226 S.E.2d at 250 ).  Although evidence of Mengedoht's relationship to\r\nCharlie would unquestionably be admissible to show Mengedoht's possible bias, the jury was already fully aware Mengedoht was Charlie's mother.  Appellant sought to\r\nask Mengedoht what she would do \"if she had to make a choice between being loyal to her friend and protecting her son.\"  This question did not seek to elicit a fact\r\ntending to show bias.  Starnes, 340 S.C. at 325, 531 S.E.2d at 914-15; cf. State v. Fossick, 333 S.C. 66, 508 S.E.2d 32 (1998) (evidence which is inadmissible to\r\nprove third-party guilt may still be admissible for impeachment purposes) (emphasis added).  We believe the question was inappropriate and the trial court properly\r\nexercised its discretion in disallowing it.\r\n\r\nIV.  Voluntariness of statements\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court abused its discretion by admitting statements he gave to the police.  We disagree. \r\n\r\nSeveral officers were involved in bringing appellant to the station and questioning appellant while there.  The three officers primarily involved were Investigator Jones,\r\nSergeant Williamson, and Major Wilson.  Jones had spoken with appellant on three occasions while investigating Joseph's disappearance.  After Joseph's remains were\r\nfound on September 16, 1997, police began investigating the crime as a homicide.  Investigators became aware of some statements appellant had allegedly made to others\r\nconcerning his role in Joseph's death.  On September 18, officers made a \"traffic stop\" of appellant to see if he would voluntarily come to the police station for\r\nquestioning.  Jones testified that probably two police cars were involved in the stop.  Appellant's two passengers testified the truck was surrounded by up to five police\r\ncars.  Jones asked appellant if he would come to the station.  Appellant answered, \"No problem,\" and rode to police headquarters in an unmarked patrol car.  \r\n\r\nAt the station, appellant was advised of his rights and signed a waiver.  Appellant eventually admitted to police he had bragged to his friends about killing Joseph, but\r\ndenied any actual involvement in or knowledge of Joseph's death.  The officers were convinced appellant was being untruthful.  At this point, Williamson thought perhaps\r\nothers were involved and appellant was holding back out of fear.  Williamson testified he pled with appellant to tell the truth.  He told appellant the only way they could\r\nhelp him was for him to tell the truth.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, appellant made a series of incriminating statements.  In the first statement, appellant told the officers he had bragged about killing Joseph but he did not really\r\ndo it.  Next he told them he had overheard some boys at school, whom he could not identify, talking about killing Joseph.  Third, appellant told police he had overheard\r\nsome people at school say they had killed Joseph.  They told appellant where Joseph's body was located.  Appellant stated he went to see the body and it was\r\ndecomposing and the bones were sticking out.  Again, appellant was unable or unwilling to identify the speakers.  \r\n\r\nBetween appellant's third and fourth statements, appellant asked Wilson about the different degrees of murder and the penalties for each.  Wilson explained that South\r\nCarolina does not have degrees of murder, and then explained to appellant the differences among murder, manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter.  \r\n\r\nAppellant then changed his story dramatically.  In his fourth version, appellant told officers Todd Ledford and Joseph had argued.  Joseph rode off on his bicycle and\r\nTodd and two other boys chased him, caught him, hog-tied him, and carried him into the woods.  After a few minutes, Todd and the other two boys returned to the truck\r\nwithout Joseph and they drove off.  Next, appellant told the officers everything in the previous story was true except for the fact that he went into the woods with Todd\r\nand the other boys along with Joseph.  He stated that Joseph was hog-tied with his feet and hands tied behind him.  When they got into the woods, the other boys started\r\nhitting and kicking Joseph.  Appellant denied hitting Joseph.  He said Joseph was crying and whimpering and he felt bad because he could have stopped them, and could\r\nhave taken Joseph home, but instead he left him there.  Appellant also described Joseph's bicycle.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, appellant took a bathroom break.  In the bathroom, he asked Williamson, \"What if someone else is involved?\"  Williamson reported appellant's question to\r\nWilson.  Wilson told appellant sometimes when people confess to a crime, they implicate others in order to get back at someone they think told on them.  Wilson told\r\nappellant he should tell the truth about whether Todd was there, because it would make appellant look worse if he lied about Todd's involvement.  Appellant then stated\r\nthat Todd was not there; he was just mad at Todd for telling on him.  Appellant again asked, \"What if someone else is involved?\" but did not name any other participants.  \r\n\r\nIn his sixth story, appellant said events happened as he had described in versions four and five, except Todd was not there, just appellant and two other boys whom\r\nappellant refused to name.  Wilson then asked what had happened to Joseph's pants. (3)  Appellant reacted physically to the question, became defensive, and then\r\nrecanted his previous stories and denied all knowledge of Joseph's death. \r\n\r\nConcerned that he had put appellant on the defensive by asking about Joseph's pants, Wilson asked Williamson to take over questioning appellant.  Williamson took\r\nappellant to the canteen for a snack and then asked for a written statement.  Appellant then gave his final statement to police, which Williamson recorded and appellant\r\nsigned and swore to.  In this statement, appellant incriminated himself only.  He stated he saw Joseph two or three weeks after Joseph was reported missing.  Joseph was\r\nbad-mouthing appellant so appellant knocked him out.  Appellant then carried Joseph to a tree, tied Joseph to it with black nylon cord, and left him there. \r\n\r\nThe first six statements were recorded in the officers' notes, but not tape recorded or signed by appellant.  Wilson corroborated Williamson's testimony regarding the\r\nsubstance of the statements.  The officers testified at no time did appellant express a desire to cut off questioning or seek the advice of counsel.  \r\n\r\nAfter he had given his written statement, appellant was permitted to meet with his parents and call his girlfriend that evening.  The next morning, after spending the night in\r\njail, Williamson advised appellant of his rights again and began to speak with him further to determine whether others were involved in the crime.  Appellant stated\r\neverything in his written statement, in which he incriminated only himself, was true.  Appellant then asked if his lawyer had arrived.  This was the first time appellant\r\nmentioned a lawyer.  Williamson immediately terminated the interview. \r\n\r\nIn response to cross-examination, Jones denied that appellant asked him for permission to call his father.  Williamson stated appellant asked for his parents during the time\r\nthey were together, but he did not permit appellant to call them.  However, Williamson did try to contact appellant's father around 5:30 that afternoon to let him know\r\nwhere appellant was.  Williamson denied telling appellant his mother was under investigation, denied threatening appellant with a \"first-degree murder\" charge if he did not\r\ngive a statement, denied promising appellant probation or boys camp in exchange for a statement, and denied promising appellant he could go home if he gave a\r\nstatement.  Wilson, who was present from about 6:00 p.m. on, similarly denied telling appellant his mother was under investigation.  \r\n\r\nThe entire interrogation, including breaks, lasted between six and seven hours. (4)  Appellant was given Miranda warnings three times during the interrogation:  upon arrival\r\nat the police station, before a polygraph was administered, and again prior to signing his written statement.  He was advised of his rights a fourth time the following morning\r\nand given an opportunity to change his statement again.  Appellant asserts his statements should have been excluded from evidence as the involuntary result of his will\r\nbeing overborne by his interrogators.  \r\n\r\nA statement obtained as a result of custodial interrogation is inadmissible unless the suspect was advised of and voluntarily waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona,\r\n384 U.S. 436 (1966).  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000).  If a defendant was advised of his Miranda rights, but nevertheless chose to make a statement,\r\nthe \"burden is on the State to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his rights were voluntarily waived.\"  State v. Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 370 S.E.2d 611\r\n(1988) (emphasis in original).  The trial judge's determination of the voluntariness of a statement must be made on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, including\r\nthe background, experience, and conduct of the accused.  Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973);  State v. Linnen, 278 S.C. 175, 293 S.E.2d 851 (1982).  If\r\na suspect's will is overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, use of the resulting confession offends due process.  Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 225. \r\nA statement induced by a promise of leniency is involuntary only if so connected with the inducement as to be a consequence of the promise.  State v. Peake, 291 S.C.\r\n138, 139, 352 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1987).  The trial court's factual conclusions as to the voluntariness of a statement will not be disturbed on appeal unless so manifestly\r\nerroneous as to show an abuse of discretion.  State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 429, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998).  When reviewing a trial court's ruling concerning\r\nvoluntariness, this Court does not reevaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial court's ruling is\r\nsupported by any evidence.  See State v. Wilson, Op. No. 25284 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 23, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No.15 at p.19, 22).  \r\n\r\nThe trial court here found appellant's statements were freely and voluntarily given, that appellant was accorded all the procedural safeguards required by Miranda, and\r\nthat appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his rights.  We conclude the trial court correctly ruled the statements admissible.  There is no evidence in the record\r\nwhatsoever of any improper conduct on the part of the investigating officers nor of any deficiency on appellant's part which would call his waiver of rights into question. \r\nAlthough some of appellant's attorney's questions of the officers on cross-examination suggested improper coercion (e.g., did they tell appellant his mother was under\r\ninvestigation, did they promise probation or boys camp in exchange for a statement), the officers denied making any such statements.  Appellant did not testify at the\r\nJackson v. Denno (5) hearing and his attorney's questions do not constitute evidence.  There is therefore no evidence in the record to contradict the officers' version of\r\nevents, nor can we infer any such evidence.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any evidence of police misconduct or diminished capacity, appellant would have this Court hold prolonged questioning of a seventeen-year-old makes\r\nany statements obtained involuntary.  Although appellant's youth and the length of questioning are certainly important factors for the trial court to consider in determining\r\nwhether appellant's statement was voluntary (see Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 225), the trial court correctly ruled the statements voluntary under the totality of the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nV.  Directed Verdict\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because there is no evidence Joseph was murdered.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nBefore a defendant in a criminal case can be required to present a defense, the State must present some proof of the corpus delicti of the crime.  State v. Brown, 103\r\nS.C. 437, 88 S.E. 21 (1916).  In a murder case, the corpus delicti consists of two elements:  the death of a human being, and the criminal act of another in causing that\r\ndeath.  State v. Martin, 47 S. C. 67, 25 S. E. 113 (1896).  An extrajudicial confession standing alone cannot constitute proof that a murder has taken place.  The State\r\nmust produce proof of the corpus delicti from a source other than the out-of-court confession of a defendant.  State v. Owens, 293 S.C. 161, 359 S.E.2d 275 (1987). \r\nThe corpus delicti of murder may be established by circumstantial evidence when it is the best evidence obtainable.  Id.  Furthermore, circumstantial evidence may be\r\nsufficient to establish the corpus delicti of murder even though the cause of death can not be determined.  Brown v. State, 307 S.C. 465, 467-68, 415 S.E.2d 811, 812\r\n(1992).  In Owens, the body of the victim was never found.  Nevertheless, we held circumstantial evidence of the victim's personal habits and relationships raised an\r\ninference that the victim's sudden disappearance was the result of death by a criminal act and was thus sufficient to establish the corpus delicti.  \r\n\r\nThe trial court ruled there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish the corpus delicti, including Joseph's good health, the rule in his house that he must be home\r\nby dark or call immediately, testimony the wooded area where Joseph's body was found was too thick to ride a bicycle, testimony from Joseph's best friend that they\r\nnever played in that area, and testimony from an officer that it is very unusual for a twelve-year-old boy to be missing for any length of time.  Appellant argues these facts\r\nare equally consistent with death by accident or sudden illness.  However, when ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or\r\nnon-existence of evidence, not its weight.  State v. Robinson, 310 S.C. 535, 538, 426 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1992).  Furthermore, in reviewing the denial of a directed verdict\r\nmotion, an appellate court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.  State v. Rowell, 326 S.C. 313, 487 S.E.2d 185 (1997).  Considering the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude the trial court properly denied appellant's motion for a directed verdict.  There is more than adequate\r\ncircumstantial evidence to prove Joseph did not die a natural death.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The contents of the statements and the circumstances surrounding their making are discussed infra in part IV.\r\n2. On direct examination, when asked what appellant said, Sydney first answered, \"I don't remember,\" and then later said, \"I do remember what he said.  It was - he said,\r\n'I killed Joseph Barefoot.'\"\r\n3. Joseph's shoes, socks, and shirt were found at the scene, but no pants or underwear were found. \r\n4. Appellant signed the first Miranda form just after 3:00 p.m. and gave his final statement around 9:30 p.m.\r\n5. 378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25338","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Allen Bullard, and Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral William Bryan Dukes; all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this petition for a writ of certiorari to determine if the post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by finding counsel did not have a\r\nconflict of interest while representing petitioner.  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nPetitioner pled guilty to trafficking in more than 200 grams of cocaine, and was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment and a $50,000 fine.  No direct appeal was\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the crime are as follows.  Police officers at the Florence airport became suspicious after observing petitioner and her husband carrying only one piece of\r\nluggage, acting nervous, and making a cellular telephone call.  The officers approached the couple, who subsequently consented to a search of their bag.  The search\r\nproduced a 223.7 gram package of cocaine.  Petitioner and Husband were both indicted for trafficking in more than two hundred grams of cocaine.  They retained the\r\nsame attorney to represent them in connection with the charges.\r\n\r\nAt the plea proceeding, the solicitor informed the plea judge that he offered petitioner and Husband a plea bargain, which consisted of the following:  petitioner and\r\nHusband could each plead to trafficking in cocaine in an amount of more than one hundred grams and each receive an eight-year sentence or either petitioner or Husband\r\ncould plead to the entire amount and receive the mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-five years, while the other person would be allowed to go free.  The solicitor\r\nadvised the plea judge that petitioner had agreed to claim responsibility for the entire amount of cocaine.  The plea judge accepted her plea.\r\n\r\nPetitioner later filed a PCR application alleging her counsel had a conflict of interest while representing her.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, counsel testified petitioner and Husband requested that he represent them both.  He stated he informed them they needed separate attorneys because\r\nif they began to implicate each other, there would be a conflict of interest.  Counsel testified both confessed to the crime and waived the potential conflict of interest\r\nbecause they did not want separate attorneys.\r\n\r\nCounsel testified that, about a day before the trial was to begin, the solicitor offered the plea bargain.  He stated the decision regarding the plea bargain was difficult\r\nbecause neither petitioner nor Husband wanted to plead guilty.  Counsel testified he explained to them that if they went to trial they would both be convicted and each\r\nwould receive twenty-five years without the possibility of parole.  He further testified he told them the better course of action would be if they both pled guilty and received\r\nless time.  However, since he felt the decision was between the two of them, he allowed them to discuss the plea bargain out of his presence.  After petitioner and\r\nHusband discussed it, petitioner decided she would plead to the entire amount. (1)\r\n\r\nCounsel testified he was \"shocked\" petitioner agreed to be the one to plead guilty because he thought she was less culpable than Husband.  He stated he did not recall\r\ndiscussing whether petitioner should retain her own counsel after the solicitor made the offer.\r\n\r\nPetitioner testified she did not have her own money to hire a lawyer and she did not understand she could have possibly obtained an appointed lawyer.  She stated if she\r\nhad understood, she would not have used the same lawyer as her husband.   Petitioner also indicated she would have gone to trial, rather than plead guilty, if she had\r\nunderstood she was pleading to a 25-year non-parolable sentence.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found counsel did not have a conflict of interest, and petitioner had failed to meet her burden of proving such a conflict.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the PCR court erred by finding counsel did not have a conflict of interest while representing petitioner?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nTo establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel due to a conflict of interest arising from multiple representation, a defendant who did not object\r\nat trial must show an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his attorney's performance.  Jackson v. State, 329 S.C. 345, 354, 495 S.E.2d 768, 773 (1998) (citing\r\nCuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335 (1980); Duncan v. State, 281 S.C. 435, 315 S.E.2d 809 (1984)).  An actual conflict of interest occurs where an attorney owes a duty\r\nto a party whose interests are adverse to the defendant's.  Jackson v. State, supra (citing Duncan v. State, supra).\r\nIn this case, an actual conflict of interest arose when the solicitor offered a plea bargain that would allow the charge against one spouse to be dismissed if the other spouse\r\nwould plead guilty to the entire amount of the cocaine.  See Duncan v. State, supra (interests of other client and defendant are sufficiently adverse if it is shown the\r\nattorney owes duty to the defendant to take some action that could be detrimental to his other client).  The conflict arose because it was in each spouse's best interest for\r\nthe other spouse to take the entire responsibility for the cocaine.  See, e.g., Edgemon v. State, 318 S.C. 3, 455 S.E.2d 500 (1995) (actual conflict of interest where\r\ncounsel convinced solicitor petitioner's co-defendants were less culpable).  At the moment the solicitor made the plea offer, petitioner's and Husband's interests became\r\nadverse to one another and counsel should have advised them accordingly.\r\n\r\nFurther, counsel acted upon this conflicting loyalty by failing to advise petitioner she had nothing to lose by proceeding to trial.  See Langford v. State, 310 S.C. 357, 359,\r\n426 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1993) (until defendant shows counsel actively represented conflicting interests, he has not established constitutional predicate for claim of ineffective\r\nassistance arising from multiple representation).  By taking the plea, petitioner received the maximum sentence.\r\n\r\nAlthough petitioner initially waived a conflict of interest, once it became clear an actual conflict existed due to the plea bargain, counsel should have either withdrawn from\r\nrepresenting one or both of them or acquired another waiver covering this specific conflict.  To be valid, a waiver of a conflict of interest must not only be voluntary, it\r\nmust be done knowingly and intelligently.  United\r\n States v. Swartz, 975 F.2d 1042, 1048-49 (4th Cir. 1992); Hoffman v. Leeke, 903 F.2d 280, 289 (4th Cir. 1990)\r\n(citation omitted).  When deciding to waive a potential conflict, petitioner was told only that she needed a separate attorney in case she and Husband began to implicate\r\neach other, something that never happened.  Petitioner should have been given another opportunity to waive the conflict, if she so chose, when the solicitor offered to\r\ndismiss the charge against one spouse in exchange for the other spouse pleading guilty to the entire amount of cocaine.  See Swartz, 975 F.2d at 1049-50 (waiver not\r\nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary unless defendant knows of precise form of conflict of interest that eventually results); Hoffman, 903 F.2d at 289 (Hoffman's waiver not\r\nintelligent \"because Hoffman could not waive what he did not know\").\r\n\r\nPetitioner has shown an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected her attorney's performance.  Further, her initial waiver of a potential conflict did not act as a\r\nwaiver of this actual conflict.  As a result, counsel was ineffective and the PCR court erred by denying her PCR application. (2)\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1. Counsel testified\r\npetitioner was going to plead guilty, but Husband was going to \"stay on the street\" and attempt to work with law enforcement.  Counsel stated he\r\ndiscussed with petitioner that if Husband was instrumental in assisting law enforcement, he would try to get her case reopened.

Smoak, Post-Conviction Judge\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25340\r\nHeard June 19, 2001 - Filed August 13, 2001\r\n\r\n\r\n  REVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\nChief Attorney Daniel T. Stacey and Assistant Appellate Defender Katherine Carruth Link, both of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for\r\npetitioner.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Allen Bullard, and Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral David Spencer; all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this petition for a writ of certiorari to determine if the post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by not finding petitioner's counsel had\r\nrendered ineffective assistance.  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nPetitioner was indicted for four counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct.  He was acquitted of two counts and convicted of two counts.  He was sentenced to thirty\r\nyears in prison on each count, to be served consecutively.  His convictions and sentences were affirmed.  State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 377 S.E.2d 298 (1989).\r\n\r\nPetitioner was accused by Pamela Chambless of having sex with her beginning when she was thirteen years old.  At trial, he admitted having a relationship with Chambless\r\nand testified they had been engaged with the intention of becoming married after she completed high school.  However, he denied he ever physically or sexually abused\r\nher.  Petitioner maintained the allegations were part of a vendetta Chambless and her family had against him for breaking up with Chambless, refusing to date her sister,\r\nand marrying her sixteen-year-old cousin. \r\n\r\nAt trial, petitioner presented evidence from numerous witnesses, including some of Chambless's extended family members, that during the period of time in which\r\nChambless was allegedly being abused, she was happy, a good student, and acted as if she enjoyed petitioner's company.  He also presented evidence that Chambless\r\nhad psychiatric problems which included attention-seeking behavior and self-mutilating behaviors.  Further, petitioner presented testimony explaining the items, such as\r\nropes and razors, found by law enforcement in and around his house, which Chambless had maintained were used by him during the sexual abuse.  Finally, he presented\r\nthe testimony of his parents, his brother, his sister, and his brother's girlfriend that they were at home almost every evening.  This testimony was presented to show\r\npetitioner could not have brought Chambless to the house essentially every other night of the week and sexually abused her as she claimed.\r\n\r\nChambless testified in detail about the sexual and physical abuse allegedly perpetrated by petitioner.  In addition, Chambless's church counselor, her psychiatrist, a mental\r\nhealth counselor, and the investigator testified about conversations they had with Chambless regarding the alleged abuse. (1)  Those witnesses named petitioner as the\r\nperpetrator.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, petitioner claimed his counsel was ineffective for failing to object, pursuant to State v. Munn, 292 S.C. 497, 357 S.E.2d 461 (1987), (2) to the\r\nwitnesses's statements that Chambless told them petitioner was the perpetrator.  Counsel testified at the PCR hearing his defense theory was that petitioner did not\r\ncommit the sexual acts and that Chambless had made up the allegations because she had a personal grudge against petitioner.  Counsel testified he did not object to the\r\nwitnesses's testimony because it was not a case of mistaken identity.  He stated he and petitioner had known for a long time what Chambless was going to say and after\r\nthe jury learned that Chambless was accusing petitioner of being the perpetrator, he was not going to make \"technical objections\" which he did not believe the judge\r\nwould sustain. (3)  Counsel stated to make those objections could have possibly upset or confused the jury and might have caused the jury not to trust his credibility as an\r\nattorney.  He testified that \"to simply call [petitioner] the perpetrator [was] like calling rain wet\" because everyone in the courtroom knew petitioner was accused of being\r\nthe perpetrator.  Counsel admitted, however, that the witnesses's testimony that Chambless had told them petitioner was the perpetrator bolstered Chambless's\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found petitioner was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to object to the testimony, and concluded counsel gave valid, strategic reasons for not objecting to\r\nthe testimony at issue.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether counsel was ineffective for failing to object to hearsay testimony that designated petitioner as the perpetrator of the sexual offenses?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nPetitioner cited several instances in the testimony of four witnesses where counsel should have objected to inadmissible hearsay testimony that named petitioner as the\r\nperson whom Chambless stated had abused her.  Petitioner also claimed counsel should have objected to Sheriff Investigator Jeff Fuller's testimony describing the details\r\nof the alleged abuse which Chambless had related to him.\r\n\r\nFor petitioner to be granted PCR as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must show both:  (1) that his counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance\r\nunder prevailing professional norms, and (2) that he was prejudiced by his counsel's ineffective assistance.\r\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80\r\nL.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Brown v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533 S.E.2d 308 (2000).  To show prejudice, the applicant must show, but for counsel's errors, there is a\r\nreasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different. Brown v. State,\r\nsupra (citing Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997)).  A\r\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.\r\nId.\r\n\r\nThe rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of an out-of-court statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception to the rule applies.\r\nJolly v.\r\nState, 314 S.C. 17, 443 S.E.2d 566 (1994).  A well-settled exception in criminal sexual conduct cases allows limited corroborative testimony.\r\nId.  When the victim\r\ntestifies, evidence from other witnesses that the victim complained of the sexual assault is admissible in corroboration; however, such evidence is limited to the time and\r\nplace of the assault and cannot include details or particulars. Id.;\r\nState v. Munn, supra. (4)  Testimony from other witnesses regarding the victim's identification of the\r\nperpetrator does not fall within this hearsay exception. Id. (5)  \r\n\r\nSince the testimony was inadmissible hearsay, counsel's failure to object to the introduction of that evidence fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  See\r\nStrickland v. Washington, supra; Brown v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n  As to the prejudice prong of Strickland, petitioner was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance because improper corroboration testimony that is merely\r\ncumulative to the victim's testimony cannot be harmless.  As we stated in Jolly, \"it is precisely this cumulative effect which enhances the devastating impact of improper\r\ncorroboration.\"  See Jolly, 314 S.C. at 21, 443 S.E.2d at 569.  Consequently, petitioner should be granted relief for the ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\n\r\nFurther, the PCR court erred by finding counsel had valid strategy reasons (6) for not objecting to the testimony at issue.  The testimony of the four witnesses relating what\r\nChambless told them regarding her alleged sexual abuse served only to bolster her credibility.  This case hinged on whether Chambless was credible.  The improper\r\ncorroboration of Chambless's allegation of sexual abuse by several witnesses thus had a \"devastating impact\" on petitioner's trial.  Counsel's failure to object because he\r\ndid not want to confuse or upset the jury does not constitute valid strategy. (7)\r\nSee  Gallman v. State, 307 S.C. 273, 414 S.E.2d 780 (1992) (counsel's failure to object to\r\ntrial judge's improper comments inviting the jury to prematurely deliberate did not constitute valid strategy). (8)  To eliminate the possibility of confusing or upsetting the jury,\r\ncounsel could have sought a determination as to the inadmissibility of the hearsay testimony out of the hearing of the jury as he had previously done.\r\n\r\nIn sum, counsel did not articulate a valid strategy for failing to object to the testimony.  Accordingly, we find petitioner is entitled to a new trial because he was prejudiced\r\nby counsel's deficient performance.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The church counselor and the investigator testified before Chambless took the stand to testify.\r\n2. State v. Munn \r\n stated the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . there is no rule allowing any and all statements made by the alleged victim to be admissible through hearsay testimony as long as the victim testifies during the case.  It\r\nis true that when the victim takes the stand and testifies, evidence that she complained of an assault may be introduced to corroborate her testimony.  This right is limited in\r\nnature, however.  \"The particulars or details are not admissible but so much of the complaint as identifies 'the time and place with that of the one charged' may be shown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n292 S.C. at 499-500, 357 S.E.2d at 463 (citing State v. Cox, 274 S.C. 624, 266 S.E.2d 784 (1980) and quoting State v. Sharpe, 239 S.C. 258, 272, 122 S.E.2d 622,\r\n629 (1961), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991)).\r\n3. However, the trial judge had previously sustained objections of a similar nature.\r\n4. See \r\nalso  State v. Cox, 274 S.C. 624, 266 S.E.2d 784 (1980) (particulars or details of victim's complaint are not admissible but so much of the complaint as identifies\r\nthe time and place with that of the one charged may be shown); State v. Sharpe, 239 S.C. 258, 122 S.E.2d 622 (1961),\r\noverruled  on \r\nother  grounds \r\nby  State v.\r\nTorrence, supra (same);\r\nState v. Harrison, 236 S.C. 246, 113 S.E.2d 783 (1960) (same).\r\n5. See also State v. Barrett, 299 S.C. 485, 386 S.E.2d 242 (1989) (social worker's testimony as to details of sexual abuse reported by victim constituted impermissible\r\nbolstering of victim's testimony because the testimony was not limited to the time and place of assault).\r\n6. Where counsel articulates valid reasons for employing a certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel.  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C.\r\n103, 525 S.E.2d 514 (2000).\r\n7. This strategy was inappropriate especially given the fact there was not overwhelming evidence that petitioner sexually abused Chambless.  For instance, while\r\nChambless's hymen was found to be ruptured upon medical examination, this examination did not occur until approximately three years after the alleged abuse had\r\noccurred.\r\n8.

Lehman, Jason B. Sprenkle, and Patrick K. McCarthy, of Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough, L.L.P., of Columbia, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: We certified this appeal for review to determine the collateral estoppel effects of a criminal conviction and a family court judgment on a subsequent\r\ncivil action.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nAppellant was tried and convicted of five counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor (CSC) and one count of committing or attempting to commit a lewd\r\nact upon a minor.  He was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for each of the CSC charges and 15 years imprisonment for the lewd act charge, with 90 of those years to\r\nbe served consecutively.  The charges arose out of appellant's sexual abuse of his children, respondents Daughter and Jim Doe.  In an unpublished opinion, the Court of\r\nAppeals affirmed his convictions.\r\n\r\nPrior to his criminal trial, the family court terminated appellant's parental rights because there was clear and convincing evidence that respondents, Daughter Doe and Jim\r\nDoe, were neglected and sexually abused while in the primary care of appellant.\r\n\r\nRespondents brought a civil action seeking damages for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and negligence per se, based upon\r\nappellant's sexual and physical abuse of them.   Respondents moved for summary judgment as to liability on the assault and battery claims on the grounds appellant was\r\ncollaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of whether he sexually abused them due to his criminal convictions and due to the family court's order terminating his\r\nparental rights.  The trial court granted the motion because the precise question at issue in the assault and battery actions had previously been adjudicated against appellant\r\nin the family court proceeding and the criminal trial.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Did the trial court err by granting partial summary judgment on the issue of appellant's liability based upon the collateral estoppel effect of appellant's prior criminal\r\nconvictions?\r\n\r\n(2)  Did the trial court err by finding appellant is collaterally estopped from litigating the issue of the abuse of Richard Doe?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nCollateral estoppel effect of criminal conviction\r\n\r\nAppellant contends he should not be estopped from relitigating the issue of his liability for assault and battery.  Although the collateral estoppel effect of a criminal\r\nconviction has never been directly addressed by this Court, we have alluded to the general rule that a criminal conviction is not binding in a subsequent civil action. (1)\r\n\r\nWe now adopt the rule that once a person has been criminally convicted he is bound by that adjudication in a subsequent civil proceeding based on the same facts\r\nunderlying the criminal conviction. (2)  See 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments Â§ 733 (1995) (\"Under the modern approach, a judgment of conviction precludes the defendant from\r\ndenying the allegations in a subsequent civil complaint as to issues that were actually litigated and adjudicated in the prior proceeding.\").\r\n\r\nWe note the reasons for the former rule were nonmutuality (3) and a difference in the degree of proof required.  See Breeland, supra.  However, when a conviction is\r\noffered in a civil proceeding against the party convicted, the party cannot complain of a difference in the degree of proof when the burden of proof in the criminal\r\nproceeding was much higher than the burden of proof in the present civil proceeding.  As a result, one of the reasons for the former rule is eliminated.  \r\n\r\nThe other reason, lack of mutuality, is also eliminated because mutuality is no longer a requirement of collateral estoppel.\r\nGraham v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Ins. Co.,\r\n277 S.C. 389, 287 S.E.2d 495 (1982) (the modern trend is to disregard the privity requirement in applying estoppel by judgment; in determining the defense of collateral\r\nestoppel notwithstanding a lack of privity, the factors the courts have taken into consideration include:  whether the doctrine is used offensively or defensively, and whether\r\nthe party adversely affected had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the relevant issue effectively in the prior action); Irby v. Richardson,\r\n278 S.C. 484, 298 S.E.2d 452\r\n(1982) (same).  Accordingly, we find the natural progression of the law of this State is to allow a criminal conviction to collaterally estop relitigation of the same issue in a\r\nsubsequent civil action.\r\n\r\nAs a practical matter, to allow a party to offensively invoke the collateral estoppel doctrine in this situation, (4) it must be shown the identical issue must have necessarily\r\nbeen decided in the prior criminal action and be decisive in the present civil action.  It must also be shown the party precluded from relitigating the issue, appellant here,\r\nmust have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination.  See, e.g., Breeland, 208 S.C. at 476, 38 S.E.2d at 648 (\"The question of his guilt here is\r\nprecisely the same as was determined adversely to him under circumstances most favorable to himself - that is, in a prosecution in which he could not have been convicted\r\nunless his guilt had been shown beyond a reasonable doubt.\"); Irby v. Richardson, 278 S.C. at 487, 298 S.E.2d at 454 (\"Where the plaintiff has had a full and fair\r\nopportunity to litigate the question of an attorney's negligence or effectiveness in a particular case, he should be collaterally estopped to adjudicate the same issue in a\r\nsubsequent legal malpractice action.\").\r\n\r\nWe find appellant, due to his conviction, is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of whether he abused his children in the civil proceeding against him. The\r\nidentical issue was decided in the prior criminal action and is decisive in the assault and battery actions. (5)  Further, appellant has had a full and fair opportunity to contest\r\nthe prior determination.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the trial court did not err by granting partial summary judgment on respondents' assault and battery claims based on appellant's prior criminal conviction for\r\ntheir abuse. (6)  Because of this conclusion, we need not address appellant's contention the trial court erred by granting partial summary judgment on the issue of appellant's\r\nliability based upon the collateral estoppel effect of the family court's judgment terminating his parental rights.\r\n\r\nCollateral estoppel effect as to Richard Doe\r\nBecause the issue of whether appellant abused Richard Doe has not been litigated either in the family court or in a criminal trial, appellant is not collaterally estopped from\r\nlitigating the issue of the abuse of Richard Doe. Accordingly, the grant of partial summary judgment as to Richard's civil action against appellant is reversed. (7)\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. See, e.g.,\r\nGlobe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. v. Foil, 189 S.C. 91, 96, 200 S.E. 97, 100 (1938) (\"While it is well settled that a conviction in a criminal prosecution is not an\r\nadjudication binding the defendant in a subsequent civil action based on the same facts . . ., a plea of guilty is an admission of the matters alleged in the indictment and the\r\njudgment entered thereon is admissible [but not conclusive] in a civil action involving the same issues as proof of that admission.\");\r\nSamuel v. Mouzon, 282 S.C. 616, 320\r\nS.E.2d 482 (Ct. App. 1984) (same); Poston v. Home Ins. Co. of New York, 191 S.C. 314, 4 S.E.2d 261 (1939) (the conviction of a person upon the charges for which\r\nhe was under indictment would be conclusive against him in his action against the insurance company, because the Court would not look with favor upon the right of any\r\nparty to profit by his own criminal act).  See also South Carolina State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs v. Breeland, 208 S.C. 469, 38 S.E.2d 644 (1946) (Court established an\r\nexception to the rule that a criminal conviction was not binding on the defendant in a subsequent civil action by stating the rule was inapplicable to the Dental Board's\r\naction to revoke Breeland's license to practice dentistry).\r\n2. We note there are exceptions to this rule.  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-6160 (1991) (\"No evidence of conviction of any person for any violation of [the chapter\r\nentitled Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways] shall be admissible in any court in any civil action.\").\r\n3. Nonmutuality arises out of the fact that the parties in the present suit are not the same as the parties in the previous suit.  Breeland, 208 S.C. at 474, 38 S.E.2d at 646\r\n(citing Fonville v. Atlanta &amp; C. Air Line Ry. Co., 93 S.C. 287, 75 S.E. 172 (1912)).\r\n4. The offensive use of collateral estoppel is permissible.\r\nSouth Carolina Property and Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 304 S.C. 210, 403 S.E.2d 625\r\n(1991).\r\n5. The criminal conviction of CSC necessarily found that appellant had committed a battery on respondents.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(1) (1985) (A person is\r\nguilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with the victim who is less than eleven years of age).  Further, the allegations giving\r\nrise to appellant's convictions preclude appellant from denying respondents' assault claim in the civil action.  See Herring v. Lawrence Warehouse Co., 222 S.C. 226, 72\r\nS.E.2d 453 (1952) (assault occurs when a reasonable apprehension or fear of bodily harm has been caused by the defendant's conduct).\r\n6. We note an acquittal will not end the litigation, because while the State may fail to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict, the defense in the\r\ncivil suit could prevail if proven by the greater weight of the evidence. Poston, 191 S.C. at 317, 4 S.E.2d at 262.\r\n7.\r\n Respondents agree the grant of summary judgment as to Richard should be reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25342","title":"Unisys v.

Johnston, Michael J. Giese, and James T. Hewitt, of Leatherwood Walker \r\n          Todd &amp; Mann, P.C., of Greenville, for appellant/respondent.\r\n\r\n        Marcus A. Manos, Wilburn Brewer, Jr., and Susan Batten Lipscomb, of Nexsen \r\n          Pruet Jacobs &amp; Pollard, L.L.P., of Columbia, for respondents/appellants.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MOORE: This dispute involves the State's \r\n  multi-million dollar contract with appellant Unisys Corporation for the implementation \r\n  of a state-wide automated child support enforcement system as required under \r\n  the federal Family Support Act of 1988. Unisys appeals the dismissal of its \r\n  complaint. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 1993, respondent Information Technology Management Office (ITM \r\n  Office) issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) soliciting bids for a child support \r\n  enforcement system. The system was to be in effect by October 1, 1995. After \r\n  a bidder's contest to the February RFP, an amended RFP was issued on October \r\n  8, 1993. This RFP was further amended six times in October and early November \r\n  1993. On November 9, Unisys submitted a successful bid. As a result, on December \r\n  30, 1993, Unisys signed an agreement to provide the system. This agreement was \r\n  signed by respondent Budget and Control Board on January 27, 1994.\r\n\r\nMore than four years later, in September 1998, respondents (collectively \"the \r\n  State\") submitted a request for resolution of a contract controversy pursuant \r\n  to the South Carolina Consolidated Procurement Code, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-4230 \r\n  (Supp. 2000). The request was submitted to Ronald Moore, the Chief Procurement \r\n  Officer (CPO) for the ITM Office. The State alleged various breaches of contract \r\n  by Unisys, including the failure to meet federally mandated deadlines for the \r\n  system to be operational. Further, it alleged fraud in the inducement of the \r\n  contract, and unfair and deceptive acts in violation of the South Carolina Unfair \r\n  Trade Practices Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20 (1985) (SCUTPA). Unisys responded \r\n  to the State's request for resolution by moving for dismissal on several grounds \r\n  asserting essentially that the CPO lacked jurisdiction. \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\nUnisys then filed this action in circuit court seeking damages for breach of contract, a declaratory judgment regarding the\r\ninapplicability of the Procurement Code on jurisdictional and constitutional grounds, and an injunction against the State's\r\nproceeding under the Procurement Code.  The State answered and filed a counterclaim alleging breach of contract, breach of\r\nwarranty, fraud in the inducement, and a violation of SCUTPA. (2)  The State then moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), (6),\r\nand (8), SCRCP, on the grounds the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the dispute between the parties which\r\nwas governed by the Procurement Code, Unisys had failed to state facts sufficient to constitute the causes of action asserted,\r\nand there was another action pending between the same parties for the same claim.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge found the Procurement Code was the exclusive means of resolving the dispute between the parties and disposed\r\nof Unisys's constitutional challenges to the Procurement Code proceeding.  He dismissed Unisys's complaint and the State's\r\ncounterclaims but enjoined the pursuit of the Procurement Code proceeding pending this appeal.  Unisys appealed the dismissal\r\nof its complaint and the State cross-appealed the injunction pending appeal.\r\n\r\nUNISYS'S APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Novel issue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisys contends the trial judge erred in disposing of its constitutional challenges to the Procurement Code proceeding on a\r\nRule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss because these are novel and complex issues.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, important questions of novel impression should not be decided \r\n  on a motion to dismiss. Where, however, the dispute is not as to the underlying \r\n  facts but as to the interpretation of the law, and development of the record \r\n  will not aid in the resolution of the issues, it is proper to decide even novel \r\n  issues on a motion to dismiss. Evans v. State, 344 S.C. 60, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  547 (2001). Here, the questions involved are questions of law and Unisys points \r\n  to no factual issues that require further development. This issue is without \r\n  merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. Exclusive jurisdiction of circuit court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge found the procedure set forth in the Procurement Code, as provided in Â§ 11-35-4230, is the exclusive means of\r\nresolving this dispute.  Unisys contends this was error because the circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction under S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 15-77-50 (1976). (3)\r\n\r\nSection 15-77-50 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit courts of this State are hereby vested with jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions, actions and\r\ncontroversies, other than those involving rates of public service companies for which specific procedures for review are\r\nprovided in Title 58, affecting boards, commissions and agencies of this State, and officials of the State in their official\r\ncapacities in the circuit where such question, action or controversy shall arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Unisys contends Â§ 15-77-50 vests exclusive jurisdiction in the circuit court \r\n  under Kinsey Constr. Co. v. S.C. Dep't of Mental Health, 272 S.C. 168, \r\n  249 S.E.2d 900 (1978). Kinsey involved two breach of contract actions \r\n  against the Department of Mental Health. The Department argued it enjoyed sovereign \r\n  immunity from actions on a contract and that the exclusive remedy available \r\n  to the plaintiffs was limited to that allowed under former Â§ 2-9-10 \r\n  (4) which provided:\r\n\r\n\r\nAll claims for the payment for services rendered or supplies furnished to the State shall be presented to the State Budget and\r\nControl Board by petition, fully setting forth the facts upon which such claim is based, together with such evidence thereof as\r\nthe Board may require.  The petition shall be filed with the chairman of the Board at least twenty days prior to the convening of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court held that by entering a contract, the State waives its sovereign immunity and consents to be sued for breach thereof. \r\nFurther, Â§ 2-9-10 was not the exclusive remedy available to plaintiffs in light of Â§ 15-77-50 which vests jurisdiction of civil\r\nactions against the State in the circuit court.\r\n\r\nWe decline to follow Kinsey (5) in this \r\n  case. First, Kinsey is distinguishable from the case at hand. In Kinsey, \r\n  Â§ 15-77-50 was enacted after the limited remedy provided in Â§ 2-9-10. \r\n  (6) In contrast, here Â§ 11-35-4230 is the later statute and therefore \r\n  takes precedence over Â§ 15-77-50. See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 \r\n  S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000) (more recent and specific legislation controls \r\n  if there is a conflict between two statutes).\r\n\r\nMoreover, five years before Kinsey, in Harrison v. South Carolina \r\n  Tax Comm'n, 261 S.C. 302, 199 S.E.2d 763 (1973), we specifically held that \r\n  Â§ 15-77-50 is not a blanket waiver of sovereignty but is essentially a venue \r\n  statute governing instances where the State is subject to suit. \r\n  (7) Kinsey does not attempt to distinguish or overrule Harrison \r\n  but discords with Harrison's essential conclusion that Â§ 15-77-50 is \r\n  not a general waiver of sovereign immunity. If the Kinsey court were \r\n  actually following Harrison, as it purports to do, \r\n  (8) it would have found the State had waived its immunity only to \r\n  the extent permitted under Â§ 2-9-10. We find the decision in Kinsey conflicts \r\n  with the basic principle that a statute waiving the State's immunity from suit, \r\n  being in derogation of sovereignty, must be strictly construed. Truesdale \r\n  v. South Carolina Highway Dep't, 264 S.C. 221, 213 S.E.2d 740 (1975), overruled \r\n  in part on other grounds, McCall v. Batson, supra; Jeff \r\n  Hunt Mach. Co. v. South Carolina State Highway Dep't., 217 S.C. 423, 60 \r\n  S.E.2d 859 (1950). Accordingly, we now overrule Kinsey and reaffirm Harrison's \r\n  interpretation of Â§ 15-77-50 as a venue statute.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Â§ 15-77-50 does not trump Â§ 11-35-4230 to vest exclusive original jurisdiction in the circuit court.\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. Application of Â§ 11-35-4230.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge found Â§ 11-35-4230 vested the CPO and Procurement Review Panel (Review Panel) with exclusive original\r\njurisdiction over the dispute between Unisys and the State.  This section provides in large part:\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 11-35-4230. Authority to resolve contract and breach of contract controversies.\r\n\r\n(1) Applicability.  This section applies to controversies between the State and a contractor or subcontractor when the\r\nsubcontractor is the real party in interest, which arise under or by virtue of a contract between them including, but not limited\r\nto, controversies based upon breach of contract, mistake, misrepresentation, or other cause for contract modification or\r\nrecision.  The procedure set forth in this section shall constitute the exclusive means of resolving a controversy between the\r\nState and a contractor or subcontractor concerning a contract solicited and awarded under the provisions of the South Carolina\r\nConsolidated Procurement Code.\r\n\r\n(2) Request for Resolution;  Time for Filing.  Either the contracting state agency or the contractor or subcontractor when the\r\nsubcontractor is the real party in interest may initiate resolution proceedings before the appropriate chief procurement officer\r\nby submitting a request for resolution to the appropriate chief procurement officer in writing setting forth the general nature of\r\nthe controversy and the relief requested with enough particularity to give notice of the issues to be decided. . . .\r\n\r\n(3) Duty and Authority to Attempt to Settle Contract Controversies.  Prior to commencement of an administrative review as\r\nprovided in subsection (4), the appropriate chief procurement officer shall attempt to settle by mutual agreement a contract\r\ncontroversy brought under this section.  The appropriate chief procurement officer shall have the authority to approve any\r\nsettlement reached by mutual agreement.\r\n\r\n(4) Administrative Review and Decision.  If, in the opinion of the appropriate chief procurement officer, after reasonable\r\nattempt, a contract controversy cannot be settled by mutual agreement, the appropriate chief procurement officer shall promptly\r\nconduct an administrative review and shall issue a decision in writing within ten days of completion of the review.  The\r\ndecision shall state the reasons for the action taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) Finality of Decision.  A decision under subsection (4) of this section shall be final and conclusive, unless fraudulent, or\r\nunless any person adversely affected requests a further administrative review by the Procurement Review Panel under Section\r\n11-35-4410(1) within ten days of the posting of the decision in accordance with Section 11-35-4230(5). . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisys contends the trial judge's ruling was erroneous for the following reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n    a. Legislature's authority to enact Â§ 11-35-4230\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle X, Â§ 10, of our State Constitution provides: \"The General Assembly may \r\ndirect, by law, in what manner claims against the State may be established and \r\nadjusted.\" Unisys contends this section limits the General Assembly to providing \r\nfor jurisdiction in matters against the State and therefore does not authorize \r\nÂ§ 11-35-4230 because that statute applies as well to suits brought by the \r\nState. \r\nThe State Constitution is a limitation upon and not a grant of power to the \r\n  General Assembly. Army Navy Bingo, Garrison No. 2196 v. Plowden, 281 \r\n  S.C. 226, 314 S.E.2d 339 (1984). \"The legislative power of the General Assembly \r\n  is not dependent upon specific constitutional authorization. The State Constitution \r\n  only limits the legislature's plenary powers. Thus, the General Assembly may \r\n  enact any law not prohibited, expressly or by clear implication, by the State \r\n  or Federal Constitutions.\" Johnson v. Piedmont Mun. Power Agency, 277 \r\n  S.C. 345, 350, 287 S.E.2d 476, 479 (1982). There is no constitutional provision \r\n  limiting the legislature's power to establish jurisdiction for actions brought \r\n  by the State and the legislature may provide for such actions as it sees fit.\r\n\r\nWe conclude art. X, Â§ 10, simply limits claims against the State to those allowed by the legislature and does not invalidate Â§\r\n11-35-4230.\r\n\r\n\r\n    b. Construction of Â§ 11-35-4230\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisys contends the language of Â§ 11-35-4230 is insufficient to vest exclusive \r\n  jurisdiction in the CPO and Review Panel. Subsection (1) of this statute provides: \r\n  \"The procedure set forth in this section shall constitute  the exclusive \r\n  means  of resolving a controversy between the State and a contractor . . \r\n  . concerning a contract solicited and awarded under the provision of the South \r\n  Carolina Consolidated Procurement Code.\" (emphasis added). Unisys claims this \r\n  language means that when the parties voluntarily chose to proceed under \r\n  the Procurement Code, Â§ 11-35-4230 is the exclusive means of undertaking that \r\n  procedure. Unisys contends the term \"exclusive means,\" when strictly construed, \r\n  is not sufficient to wrench jurisdiction from the circuit court. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThis Court has used the terms \"exclusive means,\" \"exclusive remedy,\" and \"exclusive \r\n  jurisdiction\" synonymously when discussing the Workers' Compensation Act. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985) (providing the rights and remedies provided \r\n  under that Act \"shall exclude all other rights and remedies).\" See, e.g., \r\n  Loges v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 308 S.C. 134, 417 S.E.2d 538 (1992) (exclusive \r\n  means); Carter v. Florentine Corp., 310 S.C. 228, 423 S.E.2d 112 (1992) \r\n  (exclusive remedy); McSwain v. Shei, 304 S.C. 25, 402 S.E.2d 890 (1991) \r\n  (exclusive jurisdiction). Thus, the term \"exclusive means\" has been used to \r\n  indicate exclusivity of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nFurther, because a statute waiving the State's immunity must be strictly construed, \r\n  the State can be sued only in the manner and upon the terms and conditions prescribed \r\n  by the statute. Jeff Hunt Mach. Co. v. South Carolina State Highway Dep't, \r\n  supra. The term \"exclusive means\" must therefore be strictly construed \r\n  to limit suits on contracts with the State to the forum provided in Â§ 11-35-4230. \r\n  Application of the strict construction rule, contrary to Unisys's assertion, \r\n  results in upholding the exclusivity provision of Â§ 11-35-4230.\r\n\r\n\r\n    c. Effective date \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Â¶ 3.3, the contract between the State and Unisys provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny action at law, suit in equity or judicial proceeding for the enforcement of this contract or any provision thereof shall be\r\ninstituted only in the Circuit Court in the County of Richland, State of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisys contends this provision, rather than Â§ 11-35-4230, determines in what forum this controversy must be heard.\r\n\r\nUnisys argues the \"exclusive means\" provision of Â§ 11-35-4230 was added by \r\n  statutory amendment \"effective for bids or proposals solicited on or after July \r\n  1, 1993,\" (9) and it therefore does not apply \r\n  here because the original RFP was issued on February 25, 1993, before \r\n  this provision became effective. We disagree. The contract itself recites that \r\n  it is based on an RFP issued on October 8, 1993. Since this RFP was issued after \r\n  the pertinent 1993 amendment, the amendment applies.\r\n\r\nFurther, we find the \"exclusive means\" provision of Â§ 11-35-4230 overrides \r\n  the contract provision to the extent it requires that any suit on the contract \r\n  be brought in circuit court. (10) Contractual \r\n  relationships formed pursuant to the Procurement Code are highly regulated contracts. \r\n  We have recognized that the underlying goals of the Procurement Code serve important \r\n  public interests concerning this particular contractual relationship. Ray \r\n  Bell Constr. Co. v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 \r\n  S.E.2d 725 (1998); see generally S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-20 (Supp. 2000) \r\n  (purpose and policies of Procurement Code). We now hold contracts formed pursuant \r\n  to the Procurement Code are deemed to incorporate the applicable statutory provisions \r\n  and such provisions shall prevail. Accord S.J. Amoroso Constr. Co. \r\n  v. United States, 12 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (mandatory contract clause \r\n  that expresses a significant or deeply ingrained strand of public procurement \r\n  policy is considered to be included in a contract by operation of law); see \r\n  generally Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380 (1947) \r\n  (anyone entering contract with federal government takes the risk of accurately \r\n  ascertaining limit of government agent's authority as defined by legislation); \r\n  cf. Jordan v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 294, 214 S.E.2d \r\n  818 (1975) (statutory provisions relating to an insurance contract are deemed \r\n  part of the contract as a matter of law and prevail over conflicting contractual \r\n  provisions).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, to the extent Â¶ 3.3 of the contract conflicts with Â§ 11-35-4230, it is overridden.  We therefore construe this\r\ncontract provision to require simply that the circuit court of Richland County is the proper venue for any appeal of the Review\r\nPanel's decision.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-4410(6) (Supp. 2000) (appeal of Review Panel's decision is to circuit court).\r\n\r\n\r\n    4. Right to jury trial and due process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisys contends that requiring it to proceed under the Procurement Code violates its constitutional right to a jury trial and\r\ndeprives it of procedural due process.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n    a. Right to jury trial \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nArticle I, Â§ 14, of our State Constitution provides:  \"The right of trial by jury shall be preserved inviolate.\"  Unisys claims that\r\nunder this provision, it is entitled to a jury trial on its contract controversy with the State.\r\n\r\nIt is well-settled that art. I, Â§ 14, secures the right to a jury trial only \r\n  in cases in which that right existed at the time of the adoption of the constitution \r\n  in 1868. C.W. Matthews Contracting Co. v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, \r\n  267 S.C. 548, 230 S.E.2d 223 (1976); Richards v. City of Columbia, 227 \r\n  S.C. 538, 88 S.E.2d 683 (1955); State v. Gibbes, 109 S.C. 135, 95 S.E. \r\n  346 (1918). The right to a jury trial does not apply to actions against the \r\n  sovereign that were not recognized in 1868. C.W. Matthews Contracting, \r\n  supra; accord Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U.S. 438 \r\n  (1929) (Seventh Amendment does not preserve right to jury trial on claims against \r\n  the federal government because they were not recognized at common law).\r\n\r\nAt the time our constitution was adopted in 1868, the State was immune from \r\n  suit on a contract. Treasurers v. Cleary, 15 S.C. (3 Rich. Law) 370 (1832) \r\n  (action on debt against the State); see also Hodges v. Rainey, \r\n  supra (observing that in 1934 the State was protected by total sovereign \r\n  immunity and could be sued in tort or contract only when it consented). Accordingly, \r\n  art. I, Â§ 14, does not guarantee the right to a jury trial on a contract with \r\n  the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n    b. Due process\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisys contends the proceeding available under the Procurement Code violates art. I, Â§ 22, of our State Constitution on several\r\ngrounds.  This provision states:\r\n\r\n\r\nNo person shall be finally bound by a judicial or quasi-judicial decision of an administrative agency affecting private rights\r\nexcept on due notice and an opportunity to be heard; nor shall he be subject to the same person for both prosecution and\r\nadjudication; nor shall he be deprived of liberty or property unless by a mode of procedure prescribed by the General\r\nAssembly, and he shall have in all such instances the right to judicial review.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisys contends that CPO Ronald Moore, who is the \"appropriate CPO\" referred to in Â§ 11-35-4230 to hear this\r\ncontroversy, (11) is not impartial because he was involved in the contract negotiations and amendments and investigated disputes\r\nas they arose under the contract.  Mr. Moore has in fact recused himself and has designated Voight Shealy, the Assistant\r\nDirector of the Office of General Services, to serve as acting CPO in this matter.  Unisys complains this substitution is\r\nunauthorized.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 11-35-840 (Supp. 2000) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject to the regulations of the board, the chief procurement officers may delegate authority to designees or to any\r\ndepartment, agency, or official.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis section is part of Article 3 of the Procurement Code entitled, \"Procurement Organization.\"  It is therefore a provision with\r\ngeneral application to all functions of the CPO including those functions regarding dispute resolutions under Â§ 11-35-4230. \r\nAccordingly, Mr. Moore may delegate his authority to hear this matter.\r\n\r\nUnisys further complains that Mr. Shealy is not competent to hear this matter and, in fact, no one in the ITM Office has\r\nsufficient expertise and none is qualified to serve.  Conversely, it claims everyone in the ITM Office was \"intimately involved\"\r\nin this project and cannot be impartial.\r\n\r\nUnder Â§ 11-35-4230(6), Unisys may seek a review of the CPO's decision by the \r\n  Review Panel. This review is de novo. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-4410(1) \r\n  (Supp. 2000). An adequate de novo review renders harmless a procedural \r\n  due process violation based on the insufficiency of the lower administrative \r\n  body. Ross v. Med. Univ. of South Carolina, 328 S.C. 51, 492 S.E.2d 62 \r\n  (1997) (administrator's lack of impartiality cured by de novo review \r\n  before impartial panel). The members of the Review Panel are not ITM Office \r\n  employees, see Â§ 11-35-4410(d), and there is no basis for questioning \r\n  their impartiality. As far as expertise, we question whether a circuit court \r\n  judge would have any more expertise in the area of procurement contracts. Moreover, \r\n  technical expertise is not a requirement of due process.\r\n\r\nUnisys further claims a due process violation because the General Assembly \r\n  has established no specific procedures applicable to dispute resolutions before \r\n  the CPO. We rejected a similar argument in Tall Tower, Inc. v. South Carolina \r\n  Procurement Review Panel, 294 S.C. 225, 363 S.E.2d 683 (1987), and held \r\n  the Review Panel's failure to formally adopt rules and procedures is not fatal \r\n  to due process requirements where there is an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful \r\n  time and in a meaningful manner.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the procedure set forth by the Review Panel provides for representation \r\n  by counsel, opening statements, the presentation of evidence, direct, cross, \r\n  re-direct, and re-cross examination of witnesses, and closing statements. The \r\n  complaining party presents its case first and bears the burden of proof. The \r\n  Review Panel may receive additional evidence although issues are generally limited \r\n  to those presented to the CPO. Since this proceeding meets due process requirements \r\n  and is de novo, Unisys can show no substantial prejudice from the lack \r\n  of an established procedure before the CPO. Ross, supra; Tall \r\n  Tower, supra.\r\n\r\nFinally, Unisys contends an administrative body cannot rule on the constitutionality \r\n  of statutes and therefore it should not be required to proceed under the Procurement \r\n  Code. See Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 538 S.E.2d 245 (2000) \r\n  (administrative body cannot rule on constitutionality of statute). This argument \r\n  overlooks the fact that the circuit court has already ruled on Unisys's constitutional \r\n  challenges to the Procurement Code and these issues will not be before the CPO \r\n  or the Review Panel.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the trial judge properly found no due process violation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    5. Claims for fraud, SCUTPA violation, and punitive damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnisys contends the CPO and Review Panel have no authority to resolve the State's claims against Unisys alleging fraud in the\r\ninducement, unfair trade practices under SCUTPA, and punitive damages based on Unisys's allegedly willful\r\nmisrepresentations.  It contends this contract controversy should therefore proceed in circuit court as a matter of judicial\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nSection 11-35-4230(1) specifically provides it is the exclusive means of resolving \r\n  controversies between the State and a contractor that \"arise under or by virtue \r\n  of a contract between them including, but not limited to, controversies \r\n  based upon breach of contract, mistake, misrepresentation, or other cause for \r\n  contract modification or recission.\" (emphasis added). Further, S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 11-35-4320 (Supp. 2000) provides the CPO or the Review Panel \"may award such \r\n  relief as is necessary to resolve the controversy as allowed by the terms of \r\n  the contract or by applicable law.\" (emphasis added). Accordingly, the \r\n  legislature has clearly indicated its intent that the administrative proceeding \r\n  under the Procurement Code applies to the State's claims in this case for fraud \r\n  in the inducement, which involves misrepresentation, and punitive damages. See \r\n  Smyth v. Fleischmann, 214 S.C. 263, 52 S.E.2d 199 (1949) (punitive \r\n  damages recoverable for fraudulent act independent of breach). Further, any \r\n  punitive damages award is ultimately reviewable by the circuit court on appeal. \r\n  See generally Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d \r\n  350 (1991) (providing for review of punitive damages award by judge).\r\n\r\nThe State's cause of action under SCUTPA is a different matter.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-40(a) (1985) exempts from\r\nSCUTPA:\r\n\r\n\r\nActions or transactions permitted under laws administered by any regulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority of\r\nthe State or the United States or actions or transactions permitted by any other South Carolina State law.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ward v. Dick Dyer and Assocs., Inc., 304 S.C. 152, 403 S.E.2d 310 \r\n  (1991), we rejected a \"general activity\" analysis that would exempt all activities \r\n  regulated by an administrative body. We retained, however, the exemption recognized \r\n  in State ex rel. McLeod v. Rhoades, 275 S.C. 104, 267 S.E.2d 539 (1980), \r\n  for a security transaction because it is a \"unique transaction . . . . subject \r\n  to strict regulation and must comply with stringent requirements.\" 304 S.C. \r\n  at 155 n. 1, 403 S.E.2d at 312 n.1. Similarly, we hold transactions under the \r\n  Procurement Code are exempt from SCUTPA and the State's SCUTPA cause of action \r\n  is not a viable claim. (12)\r\n\r\nThe fact that the SCUTPA cause of action is not viable, however, does not effect the determination whether administrative\r\nremedies must be exhausted but simply means the SCUTPA action is subject to dismissal in either forum.  In conclusion,\r\njudicial economy does not mandate that this action be heard in circuit court.\r\n\r\n\r\n    6. Dismissal under Rule 12(b) \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSince Unisys is required to exhaust its administrative remedies as a matter \r\n  of law, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim was proper. \r\n  Further, because an action was pending pursuant to the Procurement Code as required \r\n  when this action was brought, dismissal was also proper under Rule 12(b)(8). \r\n  See Southern Ry. Co. v. Order of Ry. Conductors, 210 S.C. 121, \r\n  41 S.E.2d 774 (1947) (exhaustion of remedies will preclude original resort to \r\n  courts where statute by express terms gives exclusive jurisdiction to administrative \r\n  agency). (13)\r\n\r\nSTATE'S CROSS-APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\nOn cross-appeal, the State challenges the trial judge's temporary injunction \r\n  against the Procurement Code proceeding during the pendency of this appeal. \r\n  A stay pending appeal is moot upon disposition of the appeal on the merits. \r\n  South Carolina Tax Comm'n v. Gaston Copper Recycling, Corp., 316 S.C. \r\n  163, 170 n.1, 447 S.E.2d 843, 844 n. 1 (1994); see generally Seabrook \r\n  v. City of Folly Beach, 337 S.C. 304, 523 S.E.2d 462 (1999) (issue moot \r\n  where decision on appeal will have no practical effect). Accordingly, we need \r\n  not address this issue.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice C. Victor Pyle, Jr., concur.\r\n1. On the merits, Unisys alleged the State had breached \r\n  the contract by failing to meet its obligations including inadequate payment \r\n  to Unisys in an amount totaling approximately $8.5 million. \r\n2. The State claimed it was exposed to $117 million per \r\n  year in federal sanctions because of Unisys's failure to complete and implement \r\n  the system for which it had contracted. Further, it sought an injunction \"requiring \r\n  Unisys to give the fully documented, latest version of the [system] source code \r\n  to the State.\" \r\n3. Unisys also cites art. V, Â§ 11, of our State Constitution \r\n  which vests the circuit court with general jurisdiction in civil cases as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Circuit Court shall be a general trial court with original jurisdiction \r\n    in civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction \r\n    shall be given to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction \r\n    as provided by law. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo the extent Unisys's brief may be read to argue that this constitutional \r\n  provision in itself guarantees the circuit court's jurisdiction over its suit, \r\n  this argument is incorrect. Article X, Â§ 10, provides: \"The General Assembly \r\n  may direct, by law, in what manner claims against the State may be established \r\n  and adjusted.\" Accordingly, jurisdiction over actions against the State is established \r\n  by the General Assembly and is not endowed by the Constitution. \r\n4. Repealed by 1981 S.C. Act No. 148, Â§ 14. \r\n5. Kinsey was expressly overruled in McCall v. \r\n  Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 247, 329 S.E.2d 741, 743 (1985), \"to the extent [it \r\n  holds] that an action may not be maintained against the State without its consent.\" \r\n6. Section 15-77-50 was enacted in 1954, S.C. Act. No. 154; \r\n  Â§ 2-9-10 was enacted in 1878, S.C. Act. No. 459. \r\n7. See also  Whetstone v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Highways and Pub. Transp., 272 S.C. 324, 252 S.E.2d 35 (1979) (confirming \r\n  Â§ 15-77-50 is essentially a venue statute). \r\n8. The Kinsey opinion cites Harrison as \"recognizing \r\n  jurisdiction in the circuit court and providing for venue in cases in which \r\n  the sovereign immunity doctrine is inapplicable.\" Kinsey, 272 S.C. at \r\n  174, 249 at 903. \r\n9. 1993 S.C. Act No. 178, Â§ 38. \r\n10. The State contends the statute controls because subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction cannot be bestowed by consent of the parties. As discussed \r\n  in footnote 13, infra, however, the exhaustion of administrative remedies, \r\n  which this case involves, does not pertain to subject matter jurisdiction. Ward \r\n  v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 538 S.E.2d 245 (2000). \r\n11. Section 11-35-310(5) and (6) indicate the \"appropriate \r\n  chief procurement officer\" is the head of the Information Technology Office \r\n  of the State. This is Ronald Moore. \r\n12. Our holding does not infringe on the Attorney General's \r\n  right of action on behalf of the State pursuant to SCUTPA. See, e.g., \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-50 through -120 (1985). \r\n13. We note that, contrary to the trial judge's ruling, \r\n  the required exhaustion of administrative remedies goes to the prematurity of \r\n  a case and not subject matter jurisdiction. Ward v. State, supra; \r\n  see generally Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d \r\n  598 (1994) (subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases \r\n  of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong). Accordingly, \r\n  Unisys's complaint was not properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  under Rule 12(b)(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25343","title":"Rollison v.

The PCR judge concluded\r\ntrial counsel rendered respondent ineffective assistance when she failed to challenge a search and when she allowed him to plead guilty, pursuant to a\r\nnegotiated agreement, to both first and second offense drug charges in the same proceeding.  We reverse.\r\n\r\n    Facts/Procedural History\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was charged with possession of crack cocaine and unlawfully carrying a pistol based on an incident in January 1995.  In June 1995, he was arrested\r\nand charged with possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute (PWID).  In addition, respondent faced two drug charges from 1994 and one from 1996. \r\nPursuant to a negotiated agreement, the State dropped the 1994 and 1996 charges, and in August 1996 respondent pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine,\r\nsecond offense PWID, and carrying a pistol.  He received concurrent sentences of twenty years suspended on service of fifteen with three years' probation\r\n(PWID), five years (possession), and one year (weapons charge).\r\n\r\nRespondent did not file a direct appeal, but did file a PCR application.  Following an evidentiary hearing, he was granted a new trial on all charges.  We granted\r\nthe State's petition for a writ of certiorari to review this decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Law/Analysis \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain relief on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a \r\n  PCR applicant must establish both that his counsel's performance fell below \r\n  an objective standard of reasonableness and that he was prejudiced by counsel's \r\n  deficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); \r\n  Brown v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533 S.E.2d 308 (2000). Further, the PCR \r\n  judge's findings should be upheld if supported by any probative evidence in \r\n  the record. E.g., Anderson v. State, 342 S.C. 54, 535 S.E.2d 649 \r\n  (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    A. Search Issue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following can be gleaned from the record:  The solicitor told the trial judge at the plea that someone called the police from a Saturn car dealership to\r\ncomplain that a man was selling crack at the dealership.   The caller said the seller always came twice on Fridays.  When the man returned a second time on that\r\nFriday, someone from the dealership again called the police, who went to the location.  The solicitor stated that when the police approached respondent and\r\nbegan questioning him, he \"resisted them.\"  When they patted him down, they found the crack.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the arrest warrant affidavit, however, the officer went to the dealership and observed respondent standing beside a vehicle.  Respondent and the\r\ncar matched the caller's description.  The officer approached respondent and began a weapons pat-down.  Respondent became combative, and after using\r\n\"necessary force,\" marijuana was found in his pocket.  The search incident to the arrest revealed the crack cocaine.\r\n\r\nA reading of the affidavit in isolation raises a question regarding the legality \r\n  of the weapons frisk. See Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85 (1979) \r\n  (police must have a reasonable belief the defendant is armed and dangerous before \r\n  they may conduct a weapons frisk). Respondent cannot rely upon this document \r\n  alone, however, to establish his ineffective assistance claim, especially since \r\n  the solicitor's rendition of facts at the plea show no constitutional error. \r\n  Respondent must also show prejudice, that is, that had his trial attorney challenged \r\n  the frisk, there is a reasonable probability that she would have prevailed in \r\n  a suppression hearing. \r\n\r\n\"Failure to conduct an independent investigation does not constitute ineffective \r\n  assistance of counsel when the allegation is supported only by mere speculation \r\n  as to the result.\" Moorehead v. State, 329 S.C. 329, 496 S.E.2d 415 (1998). \r\n  Here, we are left to speculate whether, in fact, the search was unconstitutional. \r\n  The PCR judge's finding that \"without further investigation by Defense Counsel \r\n  it would be impossible to decide on the legality of the search\" is an insufficient \r\n  basis upon which to order PCR. Assuming that trial counsel's failure to investigate \r\n  the circumstances surrounding the search fell below an objective standard of \r\n  reasonableness, respondent did not meet his burden of showing resulting prejudice. \r\n  We therefore reverse the grant of PCR on this ground. Jackson v. State, \r\n  329 S.C. 345, 495 S.E.2d 768 (1998) (grant of PCR must be reversed where no \r\n  prejudice is shown).\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    B. Plea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge also found trial counsel ineffective in allowing respondent to plead to second offense PWID at the same time he was pleading guilty to his first\r\ndrug offense.  Respondent contended, and the PCR judge agreed, that respondent and the plea judge (1) were not \"clearly informed\" that the PWID charge was\r\nbeing \"enhanced\" to a second offense based upon the simultaneous plea to the possession charge.  We find respondent knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily\r\nagreed to plead guilty to both offenses as part of a plea bargain in which the State agreed to drop three other drug charges.  We therefore reverse the grant of\r\nPCR on this ground.\r\n\r\nA defendant may, as part of a plea bargain, agree to plead guilty to a crime \r\n  for which he has been indicted (or to which he has waived grand jury presentment), \r\n  but of which he is not guilty. In Anderson v. State, supra, for \r\n  example, we held that an individual could plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter \r\n  under an indictment charging him with murder, even though the facts would not \r\n  support such a lesser charge. Cf. Gaines v. State, 335 S.C. 376 \r\n  n.1, 517 S.E.2d 439 n.1 (1999)(explaining that in North Carolina v. Alford, \r\n  400 U.S. 25 (1970), United States Supreme Court held it was constitutional to \r\n  allow accused to consent to imposition of sentence, although unwilling to admit \r\n  culpability, where he intelligently concludes that a guilty plea is in his best \r\n  interest and the evidence strongly supports his guilt). \r\n\r\nWhile the PCR judge and respondent refer to the possession charge as \"enhancing\" \r\n  the PWID charge to a second offense, this characterization overlooks the fact \r\n  that this case involves a plea bargain. As such, the agreement is governed by \r\n  contract principles, (2) and petitioner was free \r\n  to negotiate this type of agreement. See Anderson v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n  All that is required before a plea can be accepted is that the defendant understand \r\n  the nature and crucial elements of the charges, the consequences of the plea, \r\n  and the constitutional rights he is waiving, and that the record reflect a factual \r\n  basis for the plea. Anderson v. State, supra. A review of both \r\n  the plea record and respondent's PCR testimony (3) \r\n  indicates he was well aware that he was pleading guilty both to first offense \r\n  possession and to second offense PWID, and of the potential sentences he faced \r\n  as a result. Further, there was a sufficient factual basis presented for both \r\n  the PWID charge and the separate possession charge in the recitation made by \r\n  the solicitor at the plea. This is all that is required, and the plea was proper. \r\n  (4) Respondent received the benefit of the agreement for which he \r\n  bargained and cannot now complain. Cf. State v. Thrift, supra \r\n  (\"Whether a plea agreement is wise, or even in the best interests of the [party], \r\n  is not the question before us\").\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence in the record to support the PCR judge's finding that \r\n  trial counsel was ineffective in allowing respondent to accept this plea bargain. \r\n  A finding that is without evidentiary support must be reversed. Anderson \r\n  v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, the order granting respondent post-conviction relief is \r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur.  TOAL, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I concur in part, and respectfully dissent in part.  While I agree with the majority's analysis of the search issue, I disagree with the\r\nanalysis of the voluntary nature of Rollison's plea. Accordingly, I would affirm the PCR court's ruling.\r\n\r\nRollison argues he was not informed by his counsel or the guilty plea judge that he was pleading guilty to a second offense which carried an enhanced sentence. \r\nTherefore, he claims his plea was not knowing and voluntary.  I agree.\r\n\r\nEntering a guilty plea results in a waiver of several constitutional rights, therefore, the Due Process Clause requires that guilty pleas are entered into voluntarily,\r\nknowingly, and intelligently by defendants.  Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. E. 2d 274 (1969).  In order for a guilty plea to be knowing\r\nand voluntary, a defendant must be aware of the nature and crucial elements of the offense, the maximum and any mandatory minimum penalty, and the nature\r\nof the constitutional rights being waived.  Dover v. State, 304 S.C. 433, 405 S.E.2d 391 (1991); State v. Hazel, 275 S.C. 392, 271 S.E.2d 602 (1980).  When\r\ndetermining issues relating to guilty pleas, the court can consider the entire record, including the transcript of the guilty plea, and the evidence presented at the\r\nPCR hearing.  Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 318 S.E.2d 360 (1984).  Any defects in the information conveyed by defense counsel can be cured by information\r\nprovided at the guilty plea proceeding.  Moorehead v. State, 329 S.C. 329, 496 S.E.2d 415 (1998).  The knowing and voluntary nature of the plea \"may be\r\naccomplished by colloquy between the Court and the defendant, between the Court and defendant's counsel, or both.\"  State v. Ray, 310 S.C. 431, 437, 427\r\nS.E.2d 171, 174 (1993). \r\n\r\n  Based on the entire record, I would hold Rollison did not enter a voluntary plea.  There is little evidence as to what defense counsel communicated with\r\nRollison.  Rollison's testimony at the PCR hearing indicates he was not informed by his counsel before his plea that he was charged with possession of crack\r\ncocaine with intent to distribute which would be enhanced to a second offense if he pled guilty to the simple possession charge.  Furthermore, any defect in the\r\ninformation given to Rollison by his counsel was not cured by the information he received at the plea hearing because the guilty plea judge was not fully\r\ninformed Rollison was pleading to a second offense. (5)\r\n\r\nThere are two clear indications, evidenced in the record, that the plea judge was not clearly informed Rollison's charge of possession of crack cocaine with\r\nintent to distribute was enhanced to a second offense based on a first offense of simple possession which Rollison was pleading to at the same time.  First, the\r\nfollowing colloquy occurred during the plea:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      The Court:\r\n          There are three indictments, sir.  96-4898 does allege, sir, that you did on or about June 23, 1995, possess a quantity of crack cocaine with intent to\r\ndistribute in violation of the laws  of South Carolina.  Do you understand that charge?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The Defendant:&nbsp;\r\n          Yes, sir.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The Court:&nbsp;\r\n          Do you plead guilty or not guilty to that charge?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The Defendant:&nbsp;\r\n            Guilty, sir.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTherefore, when asking for Rollison's plea of guilty or not guilty, the court made no mention that he was pleading to a second offense.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the sequence of the plea indicates the plea judge was not aware Rollison was pleading to a second offense which was based upon a first offense\r\nwhich was pled to at the same time.  Rollison pled guilty to the second offense before he pled guilty to the first offense.  Furthermore, the plea judge sentenced\r\nhim for the second offense before the first offense.  Therefore, there was no conviction for a first offense upon which to base an enhanced sentence for the\r\nsecond offense.\r\n\r\nThe definition of a second offense is contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-470 (Supp. 2000).  It provides, \"[a]n offense is considered a second or subsequent\r\noffense, if, prior to his conviction of the offense, the offender has at any time been convicted under this article.\"  Id.  (emphasis added).  The plain meaning of\r\nthe statute requires a prior conviction before an enhanced sentence can be imposed.\r\n\r\nAs this Court stated in De Witt v. S.C. Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 274 S.C. 184, 262 S.E.2d 28 (1980),\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the State is prosecuting a person for an offense that carries an enhanced penalty on a conviction of a second or subsequent offense, the State is not\r\nrequired to prove the legality of the prior conviction, nor does it have to show the facts surrounding that conviction.  It is only necessary for the State to prove\r\nthat a previous conviction exists, that the conviction was for an offense which occurred prior to the commission of the offense for which the defendant is being\r\ntried, and the defendant was the subject of that prior conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 187, 262 S.E.2d at 29-30 (emphasis added).   The first offense (for which a defendant was convicted) must have occurred prior to the commission of the\r\nsecond offense.  In Rollison's case, this is true.  However, the transcript of the guilty plea shows Rollison first pled guilty to and was convicted and sentenced\r\nunder the June 1995 offense, not the January 1995 offense.  Therefore, Rollison pled guilty and was convicted of a second offense before he pled guilty and was\r\nconvicted of a first offense.\r\n\r\nA defendant can enter a valid plea to a first and second offense at the same plea hearing.  However, the court and/or counsel must clearly explain to a defendant\r\nthe consequences of such a plea.  Here, Rollison was not informed his plea to a second offense would result in an increase in his jail sentence by ten years. \r\nFurthermore, he was not told he could go to trial on the simple possession charge first before he pled guilty to the possession with intent to distribute second,\r\nand that this strategy could have helped him avoid the enhancement of his possession with intent to distribute charge. \r\n\r\nThere is ample probative evidence in the record to support the PCR court's findings. See Anderson v. State, 342 S.C. 54, 535 S.E.2d 649 (2000) (PCR court's\r\nfindings should be upheld if supported by any probative evidence in the record).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, I would AFFIRM the lower court's order granting PCR.\r\n1. While it is unfortunate that the plea judge may not have understood that respondent had no previous drug convictions, this fact standing alone does not entitle\r\nrespondent to relief.  It is respondent's understanding, not the judge's, which is at issue here.\r\n2. See State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 440 \r\n  S.E.2d 341 (1994). \r\n3. Both records are considered on appellate review of a \r\n  PCR matter. Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 318 S.E.2d 360 (1984). \r\n4. We attach no significance to the order in which respondent pled to these offenses.  As noted above, a defendant may constitutionally plead guilty to a charge\r\nhe did not commit, so long as the plea is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.  In any event, respondent's second offense plea was based on his arrest in June\r\n1995 while his plea to the first offense was predicated on his January 1995 arrest.  The actual sequencing of the pleas is immaterial, as is the issue of\r\nrespondent's guilt-in-fact, since respondent received the benefit of his constitutional plea bargain. \r\n5. I disagree with the majority's contention in footnote 1 that the plea judge's misunderstanding concerning the fact that Rollison had no previous drug\r\nconvictions does not, standing alone, entitle Rollison to relief.  The plea judge's knowledge is very much at issue.  If the judge is misinformed, it is up to the\r\ndefendant's counsel to correct his information.  If counsel fails to correct the judge's perception, his representation has fallen below the objective standard of\r\nreasonableness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25344","title":"Gill v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General G. Robert DeLoach, III and\r\nAssistant Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Eric Gill (\"Gill\") appeals the circuit court judge's order denying post-conviction relief (\"PCR\").  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background \r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 6, 1977, Isabelle Mills (\"Mills\") was cooking hamburgers at Bert's Grill along with several co-workers.  At approximately 11:00 a.m., she heard a\r\n\"bang\" and saw Gill coming towards her with a gun.  Gill fired the gun, killing Mills' co-worker, Bert Long (\"Long\"), with a gunshot wound to the head.  Mills\r\nran to the ladies room.  Gill followed her and fired the gun inside the bathroom.  He then entered the bathroom and fired the gun at Mills.  As the two struggled\r\nover the gun, the gun fired.  Mills was struck by bullets a total of three times.  Kathie Faile (\"Faile\"), another employee of Bert's Grill who was present during\r\nthe shooting, testified Gill also shot at her and one bullet hit her in the right shoulder and another hit her in the back.  Despite being shot, Faile managed to get\r\nto a phone in an attempt to call for help.  While Faile was making the call, Gill yanked the receiver from her hand and fled.  Mills and Faile saw Gill and\r\nanother man drive away from the scene. \r\n\r\nIn October 1979, Gill was found guilty of murder, grand larceny of a vehicle, armed robbery, and two counts of assault and battery with intent to kill (\"ABIK\"). \r\nDuring the penalty phase, the jury deadlocked on the question of aggravating circumstances and the judge declared a mistrial.  Thereafter, the trial judge\r\nsentenced Gill to life imprisonment on the murder conviction, eight years on the grand larceny conviction, twenty years on the armed robbery conviction,\r\ntwenty years for ABIK, and eighteen years for the second conviction of ABIK. (1)  Gill appealed his convictions and sentences, but later withdrew his appeal. \r\nThis Court ordered the appeal dismissed on February 15, 1980.   \r\n\r\n  On June 2, 1993, and July 17, 1995, Gill filed an application for PCR and an amended application for PCR, respectively.  At the PCR hearing on June 3, 1997,\r\nGill argued his appeal was involuntarily withdrawn because he was advised by counsel he could face the death penalty if he prevailed on direct appeal.  On July\r\n16, 1997, the PCR judge issued an order of dismissal denying Gill's application for PCR on the ground Gill did not sustain his burden of proving trial counsel\r\nrendered ineffective legal representation.  Gill appealed the PCR judge's order and filed a petition for writ of certiorari.  On March 9, 2000, this Court granted\r\ncertiorari.  The following issues are before this Court on certiorari:   \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  I.&nbsp; Did Gill knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his right to direct appeal when counsel advised him that if he appealed and his convictions and\r\nsentences were overturned, he could receive the death penalty upon retrial?\r\n  II.&nbsp; Did the trial court err in denying Gill's request for a jury charge on diminished capacity?\r\n  III.&nbsp; Did the trial court err in denying Gill's motion for mistrial after the solicitor commented during closing argument on Gill's failure to present a defense?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Waiver of Right to Direct Appeal\r\n\r\nGill argues the PCR judge erred by denying his PCR application because his \r\n  attorney mistakenly advised him he could face the death penalty if he prevailed \r\n  on appeal and was retried. According to Gill, this advice caused him to involuntarily \r\n  withdraw his appeal. We disagree. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  A.&nbsp; The PCR Proceeding\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove the allegations in his application.  Brown v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533 S.E.2d 308 (2000);\r\nRule 71.1 (e), SCRCP.  For an applicant to be granted PCR as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must demonstrate: (1) his counsel failed to render\r\nreasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms; and (2) he was prejudiced by his counsel's ineffectiveness.  Id. (citing Strickland v.\r\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)).  In order to prove prejudice, an applicant must demonstrate that but for counsel's errors,\r\nthere is a reasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different.  Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).  A reasonable\r\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.  Id.   \r\n\r\nThis Court must affirm the PCR court's decision when its findings are supported by any evidence of probative value.  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d\r\n624 (1989).  Likewise, a PCR judge's findings should not be upheld if there is no probative evidence to support them.  Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470\r\nS.E.2d 378 (1996). \r\n\r\nAt the June 3, 1997, PCR hearing, Gill argued he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney advised him to withdraw his appeal. \r\nSpecifically, Gill claims his attorney advised him the State could seek the death penalty if he was retried.  The PCR judge found Gill's allegation \"meritless.\" \r\nAccording to the PCR judge, Gill's testimony was not credible, and Gill did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel or prejudice.  \r\n\r\nDefense counsel testified at the PCR hearing he could not recall discussing the appeals process with Gill and could not recall whether an appeal was filed, but\r\nhe had a vague recollection co-counsel filed a notice of appeal \"just to do it.\"  While he did not recall specifically, defense counsel testified it was \"highly\r\nlikely\" he informed Gill that if his conviction was overturned on appeal, he may face the death penalty again. This advice was a correct statement of the law as\r\ndiscussed infra.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  B.&nbsp; The Clean Slate Rule\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court has never addressed whether a mistrial during the sentencing phase of a capital trial precludes the State from seeking the death penalty in the event\r\nof a new trial.  As a general rule, a court cannot retry a defendant for an offense greater than and including the offense for which he was previously convicted. \r\nConviction for a lesser included offense is an implied acquittal of any greater charges.  Therefore, a prosecution on retrial for a greater offense than that for\r\nwhich the defendant was first convicted would constitute a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 90 S. Ct. 1757, 26 L. Ed.\r\n2d 300 (1970); see also Bozeman v. State, 307 S.C. 172, 414 S.E.2d 144 (1992) (finding trial counsel ineffective for falsely informing defendant he could be\r\nconvicted of murder on retrial if he appealed and succeeded in vacating his manslaughter conviction).  However, in certain circumstances, the sentence imposed\r\nat the first trial does not prevent the State from seeking a greater sentence upon retrial.\r\n\r\nFor example, the general rule in capital punishment cases is that when a defendant's conviction is reversed on appeal, the original conviction is nullified and the\r\nslate is wiped clean. (2)  If the defendant is convicted again on retrial, the death penalty may be validly imposed.  This doctrine is known as the clean slate rule\r\nand was enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 16 S. Ct. 1192, 41 L. Ed. 300 (1896) and North Carolina v.\r\nPearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969).  \r\n\r\nIn Ball, the United States Supreme Court held the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy imposes no limitations upon the power to retry a defendant\r\nwho has succeeded in getting his first conviction set aside.  In Pearce, the question arose as to whether that same constitutional guarantee precluded the\r\nimposition of a harsher sentence after conviction upon retrial.  The United States Supreme Court held, because the original conviction was nullified at the\r\ndefendant's request, the slate was wiped clean and the sentencing court could impose any legally authorized sentence, whether or not it was greater than the\r\nsentence imposed following the first trial.   \r\n\r\nIn Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430, 101 S. Ct. 1852, 68 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1981), the United States Supreme Court recognized a limited exception to the clean\r\nslate rule - when a jury or appellate court finds the prosecution has failed to \"prove its case\" for the death penalty, and a life sentence is imposed, the clean slate\r\nrule does not apply, and the State cannot seek a harsher sentence upon retrial.  In Bullington, the jury found the petitioner guilty of murder.  The trial court then\r\nconducted a sentencing hearing before the same jury, and the parties presented additional evidence in aggravation or mitigation of the punishment.  The jury\r\nreturned a unanimous verdict of life imprisonment.  When the petitioner was granted a new trial on appeal, the State notified him of its intention to seek the\r\ndeath penalty.  The petitioner appealed to the United States Supreme Court, and they granted certiorari to review the Double Jeopardy issue. \r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court held that, where the first jury returns a unanimous verdict of life imprisonment, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth\r\nAmendment bars the imposition of the death penalty on retrial.  The first jury, by choosing life, impliedly decides the prosecution has not proved its case for\r\ndeath, and impliedly acquits the defendant of the death penalty.    According to the United States Supreme Court, the clean slate rule is inapplicable whenever a\r\njury agrees or an appellate court decides the prosecution has not proved its case.  Id. at 443-445, 101 S. Ct. at 1860-61; see also Arizona v. Ramsey, 467 U.S.\r\n203, 104 S. Ct. 2305, 81 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1984) (holding that once the trial judge rejected the death penalty and sentenced defendant to life, there could be no\r\nfurther attempt to have the death penalty imposed);  Pennsylvania v. Martorano, 634 A.2d 1063 (Pa. 1993).  But see Poland v. Arizona, 476 U.S. 147, 106 S.\r\nCt. 1749, 90 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1986) (holding the Double Jeopardy Clause does not forbid a second capital sentencing hearing where either the sentencer or the\r\nreviewing court finds evidence sufficient to justify imposition of the death penalty and, therefore, does not impliedly acquit the defendant on the merits).\r\n\r\nIn Riddle v. State, 314 S.C. 1, 443 S.E.2d 557 (1994), this Court found the\r\nDouble Jeopardy Clause did not preclude the imposition of the death sentence on remand in a capital case.  Relying on Poland, supra, the Court held that a \r\ndefendant may not be retried if he obtains reversal of his first conviction on the ground the evidence was insufficient to convict.  In Riddle, the petitioner\r\nappealed a third jury's recommendation that a sentence of death be imposed for his previous convictions of murder, armed robbery, and burglary.  The\r\npetitioner asserted on appeal that this Court's prior decision precluded consideration of the death penalty because the concurring opinion stated that no evidence\r\nwas submitted to the jury to support the aggravating circumstance.  Id. at 4, 443 S.E.2d at 559.  However, we found the relevant question in Riddle was whether\r\nthe prior decision was based on the sufficiency of the evidence or a trial error in the admission of evidence.  If the evidence was simply erroneously admitted,\r\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a retrial for sentencing.  Id. at 5, 443 S.E.2d at 560.  Because the error in Riddle was the admission of indictments and\r\nverdict forms from the first trial as proof of aggravating circumstances, the error was one of admission of evidence, rather than insufficiency of evidence. \r\nTherefore, we held the trial judge properly denied the defendant's motion to quash the notice of death penalty on Double Jeopardy grounds.  Id.            \r\n\r\nThe instant case does not involve a decision by the trial judge or jury that the prosecution had not proved its case because the jury was deadlocked during the\r\npenalty phase.  Other jurisdictions have found the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the prosecution from seeking the death penalty on retrial for murder\r\nwhere a life sentence was imposed during the penalty phase following the first trial by operation of law due to jury deadlock.  In Martorano, supra, the\r\nPennsylvania Supreme Court found where a jury is deadlocked during the sentencing phase of a capital trial, there is no implied acquittal because the jury did\r\nnot make a decision.  Furthermore, the imposition of a life sentence by a trial judge does not operate as an implied acquittal because, under Pennsylvania's\r\nsentencing scheme, the judge has no discretion to fashion a sentence once he finds the jury is deadlocked.  Martorano, 634 A.2d at 1070; see also Pennsylvania\r\nv. Sattazahn, 763 A.2d 359 (Pa. 2000) (upholding the Martorano decision concerning jury deadlock and finding this decision did not have a chilling effect so as\r\nto constitute a de facto denial of defendant's right to appeal); Kentucky v. Eldred, 973 S.W.2d 43 (Ky. 1998) (finding Double Jeopardy did not bar capital\r\nprosecution on retrial where a jury in the first trial found the presence of aggravating circumstances, but recommended life).\r\n\r\nGill argues the Bullington exception applies in this case and, therefore, his trial counsel was ineffective because he advised Gill he could be sentenced to death\r\nupon retrial.  First, Bullington was decided in 1981 and the order dismissing Gill's appeal is dated February 15, 1980.  Therefore, Gill's trial counsel did not\r\nprovide incorrect legal advice because the Bullington exception was not available at that time. (3)  Second, the Bullington exception is not applicable  because the\r\njury was deadlocked in this case and was unable to decide whether the death penalty was appropriate.  The life sentence in this case did not amount to an\r\nimplied acquittal of the death penalty as was the case in Bullington.  Here, the jury deadlocked on the existence of aggravating circumstances.  The trial judge\r\nimposed a life sentence pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (C) (Supp. 2000), which states, \"If members of the jury after a reasonable deliberation cannot\r\nagree on a recommendation as to whether or not the death sentence should be imposed on a defendant found guilty of murder, the trial judge shall dismiss such\r\njury and shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in subsection (A).\"  In the event of a jury deadlock, the trial judge exercises no discretion\r\nand merely imposes the sentence mandated by section 16-3-20 (C).\r\n\r\nTherefore, the PCR judge's decision is affirmed because defense counsel adequately advised Gill of the consequences of appealing his life sentence, and Gill\r\nhas not demonstrated either ineffective assistance of counsel or prejudice.            \r\n\r\nII.  Diminished Capacity\r\n\r\nGill argues on direct appeal the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the \"diminished capacity doctrine.\"  Even though Gill concedes South\r\nCarolina does not accept the diminished capacity doctrine, he argues it is applicable, and his conviction should be reversed because the State failed to prove\r\nmalice.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Dr. Harold Morgan, a forensic psychiatrist, testified Gill had a borderline intellectual capacity (I.Q. of 73), and he possessed an antisocial personality. \r\nAs a result of these conditions, Dr. Morgan testified Gill could not formulate malice aforethought, an essential element of murder.  According to Dr. Morgan,\r\nGill had a personality disorder as a result of an absent mother and father, which resulted in Gill's inability to handle problems or think of the consequences of\r\nhis behavior.  \r\n\r\nAt the close of the trial, Gill's attorney asked the trial judge to charge diminished capacity, an accepted defense in several jurisdictions. The diminished\r\ncapacity doctrine allows a defendant to offer evidence of his mental condition with respect to his capacity to achieve the mens rea required for the commission\r\nof the offense charged.  21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law Â§ 38 (1998).  In particular, the defense may be invoked to negate specific intent, where such intent is an\r\nelement of the offense charged.  Id.  Diminished capacity differs from the insanity defense in that it may be raised by a defendant who has conceded to be\r\nlegally sane.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge did not err by refusing to charge diminished capacity because it is not recognized in South Carolina.  Furthermore, according to this Court in\r\nState v. Fuller, 229 S.C. 439, 93 S.E.2d 439 (1956), a defendant is not entitled to an instruction concerning his capacity to form the requisite intent for malice\r\naforethought when the instructions, taken as a whole, properly present elements of malice.  Gill received proper jury charges on murder, voluntary\r\nmanslaughter, ABIK, insanity, and self defense.  These jury charges, taken as a whole, were sufficient because they adequately presented the elements of malice\r\nas recognized by South Carolina law.          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Solicitor's Comments During Closing Arguments\r\n\r\nGill argues the trial court erred by failing to grant a mistrial based on the solicitor's statement during closing arguments that Gill failed to present a defense. \r\nWe disagree.\r\nDuring closing argument, the solicitor made the following remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\nNow as I sit in the courtroom and listened to testimony trying to anticipate  somebody's defense, something he can hang his hat on.  What is that defense in this\r\ncase?  I'll tell you my opinion.  Of course, His Honor is in charge of the law, but in my opinion there is no defense in this case.  They have failed.  Mr. Fewster\r\nis a good attorney.  Mr. Honeycutt is a good attorney, but they are shackled by the facts of the case.  They are limited as to what they can do in the case.  What\r\ncan they do to put up a defense in the case?  There is no defense in this case.  October 6th, 1977, Bert Long for no justifiable reason, for no justifiable cause, for\r\nnothing that he did, was murdered.  Now you can call it killed, you can call it snuffed out, I'll tell you there is no way to get around it, it was cold blooded\r\nmurder.  There is no other way to describe it.  These two attorneys can play legal gymnastics with words and try and turn this phrase around and this phrase\r\naround, but it's murder.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  \r\n\r\nGill argues the trial judge should have granted a mistrial because the solicitor referred to Gill's failure to present a defense, which violated his right to remain\r\nsilent under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  It is impermissible for the prosecution to comment directly or indirectly upon the defendant's failure to\r\ntestify at trial.  Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).  However, even improper comments on a defendant's failure to testify do not\r\nautomatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant.  Id.  The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that improper comments on his\r\nrefusal to testify deprived him of a fair trial.  Id.   Furthermore, even if the solicitor makes an improper comment on the defendant's failure to testify, a curative\r\ninstruction emphasizing the jury cannot consider defendant's failure to testify against him will cure any potential error.  Id.              \r\n\r\nGill's argument concerning the solicitor's remarks is without merit.  First, the solicitor's remarks implied Gill did not have a defense, which most likely meant\r\nhe did not have a defense of insanity or self defense.  Second, any prejudice caused by the remarks was eliminated by the trial judge's curative instruction to the\r\njury, which emphasized the defendant did not have to demonstrate his innocence, and his failure to testify could not be considered during their deliberations. \r\nFinally, any error caused by the solicitor's remarks was harmless considering the overwhelming evidence of Gill's guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    Conclusion \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we AFFIRM  the PCR court's decision, \r\n  Gill's sentences, and Gill's convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n     \r\n1. This was Gill's second trial.  At the first trial, Gill was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.  However, his conviction and sentence were reversed\r\nby this Court in State v. Gill, 273 S.C. 190, 255 S.E.2d 455 (1979), because the trial judge instructed the jurors they could begin consideration of the case prior\r\nto completion so long as they confined their consideration to the jury room.  The trial judge also erred by failing to find as a matter of law, for sentencing\r\npurposes, Gill's prior conviction for statutory rape was not a conviction for a crime involving the use of violence against another person.\r\n2. See Anne Essaye, Cruel and Unusual Punishment, 75 Geo. L.J. 1168 (Feb. 1987).\r\n3. In 1980, the United State Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prevent a more severe sentence at retrial.  United\r\nStates v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 101 S. Ct. 426, 66 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1980).  Ball, supra, and Pearce, supra, were also applicable at the time of Gill's appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25345","title":"Tatum v.

Medical University of South Carolina, 335 S.C. 499, 511, 517 S.E.2d \r\n706, 713 (Ct. App. 1999), in which the Court of Appeals adopted the \"dual persona \r\ndoctrine\" and held \"where [an] employer-hospital and its physicians negligently \r\ntreat an employee for a work-related accident and, in doing so, exacerbate the \r\ninjury,\" a tort action may be maintained by the employee against the employer-hospital. \r\nWe reverse. \r\n\r\n    FACTS \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent Tatum (Mrs. Tatum) injured her back in the course of her employment \r\n  with Petitioner Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). She was treated \r\n  at MUSC's Employee Health Care Service and diagnosed with a midline broadly-based \r\n  disc herniation. \r\n\r\nMrs. Tatum was later referred to Dr. Sunil J. Patel, a physician employed by \r\n  MUSC as an assistant professor and neurosurgeon. Ultimately, Dr. Patel performed \r\n  three surgeries on Mrs. Tatum's back. \r\n\r\nMrs. Tatum filed a medical malpractice action against MUSC alleging she suffered \r\n  permanent damage to her spinal cord as a result of Dr. Patel's negligence. Her \r\n  husband, Respondent Scarbrough, asserted a claim for loss of consortium. MUSC \r\n  denied the allegations in Mrs. Tatum's complaint and claimed Mrs. Tatum's exclusive \r\n  remedy was under the Workers' Compensation Act. \r\n\r\nFinding workers' compensation was Mrs. Tatum's exclusive remedy, the trial \r\n  court granted MUSC's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. Mrs. Tatum \r\n  appealed.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed. It reasoned 1) an employee injured within the \r\n  scope of employment may maintain a malpractice action against a negligent treating \r\n  physician; 2) the South Carolina Tort Claims Act prohibits Mrs. Tatum from maintaining \r\n  a malpractice action against Dr. Patel because he is MUSC's employee 3) the \r\n  provisions of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act preclude her from \r\n  maintaining a tort action against her employer MUSC; 4) nonetheless, pursuant \r\n  to the \"dual persona\" doctrine, Mrs. Tatum may maintain a malpractice action \r\n  against MUSC, not as her employer, but as a provider of hospital services. Tatum, \r\n  335 S.C. 499, 517 S.E.2d 706.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ISSUE \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by holding an employee of a governmental entity/hospital \r\n  who sustains a compensable work-related injury may maintain a tort action against \r\n  the governmental entity/hospital for the negligence of the treating physician? \r\n  (1) \r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis case asks us to resolve the conflict, if any, between the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act (the Tort Claims Act) (2) and \r\n  the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act (the Worker's Compensation Act). \r\n  (3) \r\n\r\nUnder the Tort Claims Act, \"[t]he State, an agency, a political subdivision, \r\n  and a governmental entity are liable for their torts in the same manner and \r\n  to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject \r\n  to the limitations upon liability and damages, and exemptions from liability \r\n  and damages, contained [in the Act].\" Â§ 15-78-40. The Tort Claims Act does not \r\n  create causes of action. Rather, it removes the common law bar of sovereign \r\n  immunity in certain circumstances, but only to the extent permitted by the Act \r\n  itself. Summers v. Harrison Constr., 298 S.C. 451, 381 S.E.2d 493 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989). The Tort Claims Act specifically provides: \"[t]he governmental entity \r\n  is not liable for a loss resulting from any claim covered by the South Carolina \r\n  Workers' Compensation Act, except claims by or on behalf of an injured employee \r\n  to recover damages from any person other than the employer. . .\". Â§ 15-78-60 \r\n  (14).\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Tort Claims Act, an employee of a governmental entity who commits \r\n  a tort while acting within the scope of his official duty is generally immune \r\n  from suit. Â§ 15-78-70 (a) and (b). Instead, a person seeking to file a tort \r\n  claim against a governmental entity must \"name as a party defendant only the \r\n  agency or political subdivision for which the employee was acting.\" Â§ 15-78-70(c).\r\n\r\nMUSC is a governmental agency subject to the provisions of the Tort Claims \r\n  Act. Proveaux v. Medical University of South Carolina, 326 S.C. 28, 482 \r\n  S.E.2d 774 (1997). Accordingly, a physician-employee of MUSC is immune from \r\n  suit for alleged negligence committed in the course of employment. Id.&nbsp; \r\n  A tort action against a physician-employee of MUSC must be maintained against \r\n  MUSC.\r\n\r\nThe Workers' Compensation Act provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The rights and remedies granted by this Title to an employee when \r\n    he and his employer have accepted the provisions of this Title, respectively, \r\n    to pay and accept compensation on account of personal injury or \r\n    death by accident, shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such \r\n    employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next \r\n    of kin as against his employer, at common law or otherwise, \r\n    on account of such injury, loss of service or death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (emphasis added). \r\n\r\n\r\n  The Workers' Compensation Act further provides:\r\n\r\n   . . . [T]he employer shall not be liable in damages for malpractice by a physician \r\n    or surgeon furnished by him pursuant to the provisions of this section, but \r\n    the consequences of any such malpractice shall be deemed part of the injury \r\n    resulting from the accident and shall be compensated for as such. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 42-15-70. \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals asserted the purpose of Â§ 42-15-70 \"was simply to insulate \r\n  the employer from liability for a treating physician's negligence merely because \r\n  the employer exercised control in choosing the physician.\" \r\n  (4) Tatum, 335 S.C. 499, 505, 517 S.E.2d 706, 709. It maintained \r\n  while Â§ 42-15-70 protects an employer from suit resulting from the negligence \r\n  of a treating physician, it does not preclude an injured employee from maintaining \r\n  a malpractice action against the negligent treating physician. Id. \r\n\r\nIt is undisputed Mrs. Tatum may not maintain a tort action against Dr. Patel \r\n  but must, instead, prosecute the action against MUSC in order to comply with \r\n  the provisions of the Tort Claims Act. However, because the exclusivity provisions \r\n  of the Worker's Compensation Act preclude a tort action against the employer, \r\n  the Court of Appeals concluded Tatum is \"a victim of the circuitous statutory \r\n  logic which, at least in theory, was enacted to benefit her.\" Tatum, \r\n  S.C. at 506, S.E.2d at 709. To overcome this \"circuitous statutory logic,\" the \r\n  Court of Appeals adopted the \"dual persona\" doctrine. Under the \"dual persona\" \r\n  doctrine adopted by the Court of Appeals, \"once MUSC referred Tatum to Dr. Patel \r\n  for treatment, its role as her employer ended, and it took on the legally distinct \r\n  persona of her treating hospital.\" Tatum, S.C. at 511, S.E.2d at 713. \r\n  In effect, the Court of Appeals determined, in passing the Tort Claims Act and \r\n  Workers' Compensation Act, the General Assembly intended to allow government \r\n  employees who sustain work-related injuries subject to the Workers' Compensation \r\n  Act the right to maintain tort actions against their government employers for \r\n  the negligence of treating physicians.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note this is a case of statutory interpretation. The cardinal \r\n  rule of statutory construction is for the Court to ascertain and effectuate \r\n  the intent of the legislature. Lester v. South Carolina Workers' Compensation \r\n  Comm'n, 334 S.C. 557, 514 S.E.2d 751 (1999). We conclude provisions in both \r\n  the Tort Claims Act and Workers' Compensation Act clearly establish the General \r\n  Assembly did not intend to allow a government employee to maintain a tort action \r\n  against her employer when workers' compensation is applicable.\r\n\r\nFirst, in passing the Tort Claims Act, the legislature contemplated the effect \r\n  of tort liability on government employers where government employees sustain \r\n  a work-related injury. The Tort Claims Act specifically bars an action by an \r\n  employee against her government employer when the claim is covered by workers' \r\n  compensation. Â§ 15-78-60 (14) (\"[t]he governmental entity is not liable for \r\n  a loss resulting from any claim covered by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation \r\n  Act . . .\".); see Lester S. Jayson and Robert C. Longworth Handling \r\n  Federal Tort Claims Â§ 5.05[2][f] (2000) (\"[w]hen an employee has sustained \r\n  injuries which are compensable under the [Federal Employees] Compensation Act, \r\n  and those injuries are aggravated, or others are sustained, in the course of \r\n  treatment for the initial injuries, as for example, when there has been negligence \r\n  or malpractice in the government hospital where the employee was sent, the employee \r\n  may not prosecute a separate claim under the [Federal] Tort Claims Act for such \r\n  aggravation or subsequent injuries. Here, too, the Compensation Act provides \r\n  the exclusive remedy.\"). In keeping with the provisions of the Workers' Compensation \r\n  Act, government employers, like private employers, are not liable in tort for \r\n  work-related injuries sustained by their employees. Â§ 15-78-40 (\". . . governmental \r\n  entities are liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent \r\n  as a private individual in like circumstances . . . \".).\r\n\r\nSecond, the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act precludes \r\n  an employee from maintaining a tort action against her employer where the employee \r\n  sustains a work-related injury. Â§ 42-1-540 (the remedies granted an employee \r\n  to accept compensation excludes all other remedies against his employer). The \r\n  State and its employees are subject to the exclusivity provision of the Workers' \r\n  Compensation Act. Â§ 42-1-320 (Supp. 1999).\r\n\r\nSection 42-15-70 is particularly applicable. As noted above, Â§ 42-15-70 provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . . [T]he employer shall not be liable in damages for malpractice by a physician \r\n    or surgeon furnished by him pursuant to the provisions of this section, but \r\n    the consequences of any such malpractice shall be deemed part of the injury \r\n    resulting from the accident and shall be compensated for as such. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 42-15-70 has been interpreted as providing \"the aggravation of an injury \r\n  by medical or surgical treatment necessitated by an original compensable injury \r\n  is compensable and new injuries resulting indirectly from the original injury \r\n  or from medical or surgical treatment are likewise compensable.\" Whitfield \r\n  v. Daniel Constr. Co., 226 S.C. 37, 41, 83 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1954); see \r\n  82 Am. Jur. 2d Workers' Compensation Â§ 371 (1992) (\". . . rule that a \r\n  new injury or aggravation of an injury under treatment, as result of that treatment, \r\n  arises out of and in the course of employment has been followed even where the \r\n  aggravation of the work-related injury is caused by medical malpractice.\"). \r\n  The original work-related injury is regarded as the proximate cause of the damage \r\n  flowing from the subsequent negligent treatment. Whitfield, supra \r\n  (\"[e]very natural consequence which flowed from this injury, unless the result \r\n  of an independent intervening cause, sufficient to break the chain of causation, \r\n  is likewise compensable.&quot;).\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that, in general, treating physicians, as \r\n  third parties to the employer-employee relationship, do not fall within the \r\n  immunity provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act and are subject to suit. \r\n  Â§ 42-1-540 (employee may maintain action at law against \"any person other than \r\n  the employer\"); see 6 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's \r\n  Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 112.02[1][a] (1999) (\"[w]hen a physician has \r\n  no special status under the act conferring immunity, every jurisdiction dealing \r\n  with the question has recognized in some form that a suit will lie against a \r\n  physician who has aggravated a compensable injury by malpractice.\"). \r\n  (5) Unlike a treating physician, however, the employer is not a third \r\n  party amenable to suit. Section 42-1-540 authorizes suit against \"any person \r\n  other than the employer.\" Section 42-15-70 expressly states the employer shall \r\n  not be liable in tort for the physician's malpractice. Instead, the consequences \r\n  of the malpractice are compensated as part of the work-related injury without \r\n  the necessity of the employee establishing traditional tort liability. \r\n  (6) The plain language of the Workers' Compensation Act precludes \r\n  suit by an employee against her employer. Lester, 334 S.C. 557, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  751 (if a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and \r\n  definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation \r\n  and the Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning).\r\n\r\nThird, even if we were persuaded the Tort Claims Act and Workers' Compensation \r\n  Act did not specifically preclude suit by a government employee against her \r\n  government employer for the negligence of the treating physician, the \"dual \r\n  persona\" doctrine would nevertheless be inapplicable under the circumstances \r\n  of this case. Under the \"dual persona\" doctrine, \"[a]n employer may become a \r\n  third person, vulnerable to suit by an employee, if - and only if - it possesses \r\n  a second persona so completely independent from and unrelated to its status \r\n  as employer that by the established standards the law recognizes that persona \r\n  as a separate legal person.\" Larson's Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 113.01 \r\n  [1] (1999). Larson suggests use of the term \"persona\" is dictated by the typical \r\n  third-party workers' compensation statute which usually defines a third party \r\n  as \"a person other than the employer.\" (7) \r\n  The \"dual persona\" concept is applied in situations where the law clearly recognizes \r\n  \"the duality of legal persons, so that it may be realistically assumed that \r\n  a legislature would have intended that duality to be respected.\" Id. \r\n  Â§ 113.01 [2]; see 82 Am. Jur. 2d Workers' Compensation Â§ 82 (1992) \r\n  (for \"dual persona\" doctrine to apply, employer must have a completely unrelated \r\n  and legally recognized identity other than as employer to be liable in a tort \r\n  action).\r\n\r\nLarson carefully distinguishes the \"dual persona\" doctrine from the \"dual capacity\" \r\n  doctrine. Under the \"dual capacity\" doctrine, an employer becomes vulnerable \r\n  to suit as a third party \"if he occupies, in addition to his capacity as employer, \r\n  a second capacity that confers on him obligations independent to those imposed \r\n  on him as employer.\" 2A Larson Workmen's Compensation Law Â§ 72:80 (1976). \r\n  While the \"dual persona\" doctrine recognizes different identities, the \"dual \r\n  capacity\" doctrine recognizes different activities or relationships. Larson's \r\n  Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 113.01 [2] (1999). Larson disfavors the \"dual \r\n  capacity\" doctrine, noting courts have tended to use the judicially-created \r\n  doctrine to destroy employer immunity simply when there are separate legal theories \r\n  which can be brought against the employer and suggests the \"dual persona\" doctrine \r\n  is more tolerable. Our Court has rejected the \"dual capacity\" doctrine. Johnson \r\n  v. Rental Uniform Service of Greenville, 316 S.C. 70, 447 S.E.2d 184 (1994).\r\n\r\nWhile this Court has not considered the \"dual persona\" theory, several states \r\n  have adopted the \"dual persona\" doctrine in the context of product liability \r\n  suits by employees. See Thomeier v. Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., 928 F. \r\n  Supp. 548 (W.D. Pa. 1996) (under \"dual persona\" doctrine, injured employee may \r\n  maintain tort action against employer when the employer is the corporate successor \r\n  of the manufacturer of the defective product that caused the injury and the \r\n  product was manufactured before the corporate merger); Thomas v. Valmac Indus., \r\n  812 S.W.2d 673 (Ark. 1991) (same); Percy v. Falcon Fabricators, Inc., \r\n  584 So.2d 17 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991) (same); Robinson v. KFC Nat. Management \r\n  Co., 525 N.E.2d 1028 (Ill. 1988) (same); Gurry v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., \r\n  550 N.E.2d 127 (Mass. 1990) (same); Kimzey v. Interpace Corp., Inc., \r\n  694 P.2d 907 (Kan. Ct. App. 1985) (same); Schweiner v. Hartford Acc. &amp; \r\n  Indem. Co., 354 N.W.2d 767 (Wis. Ct. App. 1984) (same); Billy v. Consolidated \r\n  Mach. Tool Corp., 412 N.E.2d 934 (N.Y. 1980) (same). Similarly, courts have \r\n  applied the \"dual persona\" doctrine where the employer has other legally-recognized \r\n  identities. See Evans v. Thompson, 879 P.2d 938 (Wash. 1994) (employees/plaintiffs \r\n  could maintain suit against defendants who owned the land upon which plaintiffs \r\n  were injured and were also corporate shareholders, officers, directors, and \r\n  co-employees of employer corporation); Rauch v. Officine Curioni, S.P.A., \r\n  508 N.W.2d 12 (Wis. Ct. App. 1993) (employee could maintain tort action against \r\n  employer, since in creating legal entity separate from employer-corporation \r\n  to own and lease machine which injured employee, employer created second persona \r\n  independent and unrelated to status as employer); LaBelle v. Crepeau, \r\n  593 A.2d 653 (Me. 1991) (employee could maintain suit against corporate employer's \r\n  majority stockholder who was landlord and owner of the work site);&nbsp;Doggett \r\n  v. Patrick, 398 S.E.2d 770 (Ga. Ct. App. 1990) (grocery store employee may \r\n  maintain action against landlord who leased premise to corporate employer-store \r\n  even though landlord was president of corporation); but see  Estate \r\n  of Blakely v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd, 766 F.Supp. 721 (E.D. Ark. 1991) (workers' \r\n  compensation exclusivity did not apply to employee's products liability action \r\n  against employer based on exposure to asbestos which was manufactured by employer \r\n  and applied in employer's plant by outside contractor). \r\n  (8) Conceptually, under the \"dual persona\" doctrine the employee is \r\n  not suing his employer, but rather the legal entity which is alleged to have \r\n  caused his injury.\r\n\r\nCourts have declined to apply the \"dual persona\" doctrine in situations where \r\n  the employer does not have separate legal identities at the time of the work-related \r\n  injury. Durham v. County Village Assoc., 1999 WL 169402 (Del. Super. \r\n  1999) (relying on \"dual persona\" doctrine, maintenance employee-tenant at apartment \r\n  complex could not maintain action against employer-landlord after sustaining \r\n  work-related injury); Estate of Donley v. Pace Indus., 984 S.W.2d 421 \r\n  (Ark. 1999) (estate of employee killed in work accident involving machine precluded \r\n  from maintaining products liability action against company that used to own \r\n  machine and company's parent, both of which had merged three years earlier with \r\n  employee's employer); Singhas v. New Mexico State Highway Dep't, 946 \r\n  P.2d 645 (N.M. 1997) (\"dual persona\" doctrine did not provide exception to workers' \r\n  compensation exclusivity provision so as to allow one state agency's employee \r\n  to bring tort suit against another state agency for injuries sustained in work-related \r\n  automobile accident); Samson v. DiConzo, 669 A.2d 760 (Me. 1996) (cocktail \r\n  waitress injured by patron failed to establish employers who performed different \r\n  functions and duties within restaurant in individual capacities were separate \r\n  legal entity); Li v. C.N. Brown Co., 645 A.2d 606 (Me. 1994) (without \r\n  alleging employer maintained separate legal identity as owner of premises where \r\n  employee convenience store worker was shot and killed, exclusive remedy against \r\n  employer was workers' compensation); Quinn v. DiPietro, 642 A.2d 1335 \r\n  (Me. 1994) (employee could not maintain suit against employer who both operated \r\n  business and co-owned building).\r\n\r\nThe \"dual persona\" theory is inapplicable to the facts of this case. Contrary \r\n  to the Court of Appeals' assertion, MUSC did not take on the \"legally distinct \r\n  persona of [Mrs. Tatum's] treating hospital\" by referring her to Dr. Patel for \r\n  treatment. MUSC is only one legal entity even though it may act in many different \r\n  capacities, including those of employer and medical provider. McAlister v. \r\n  Methodist Hospital of Memphis, 550 S.W.2d 240, 246 (Tenn. 1977) (court refused \r\n  to apply \"dual persona\" theory to permit suit against hospital-employer, recognizing \r\n  \"[t]he employer is the employer; not some person other than the employer.\"). \r\n  Even if we were to adopt the \"dual persona\" doctrine, it is inapplicable in \r\n  this situation.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Court of Appeals' analysis assumes all employees may maintain \r\n  a tort action against physicians for negligently treating a work-related injury. \r\n  This assumption ignores the workers' compensation principle providing statutory \r\n  immunity for co-employees. Â§ 42-5-10 (when an employer accepts the workers' \r\n  compensation provisions, \"he or those conducting his business shall only be \r\n  liable to any employee . . . to extent provided in Act.\"); Nolan v. Daley, \r\n  222 S.C. 407, 73 S.E.2d 449 (1952) (\"those conducting his business\" includes \r\n  any person who is performing any work incident to the employer's business); \r\n  Neese v. Michelin Tire Corp., 324 S.C. 465, 478 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1996), \r\n  overruled on other grds.  Abbott v. The Limited, Inc., 338 S.C. \r\n  161, 526 S.E.2d 513 (2000) (employee injured by actions of co-employee conducting \r\n  employer's business is barred by Workers' Compensation Act from proceeding in \r\n  tort against co-employee). While we need not decide whether physicians may be \r\n  liable in tort to their co-employees, it is at least questionable whether Mrs. \r\n  Tatum could have maintained a tort action against her co-employee Dr. Patel \r\n  in spite of the Tort Claims Act provision requiring suit against the employer \r\n  or the Workers' Compensation Act exclusivity provisions. See Daniels \r\n  v. Seattle Seahawks, 968 P.2d 883 (Wash. Ct. App. 1998) (co-employee doctor \r\n  was immune from action by employee for negligence in diagnosis and treatment \r\n  of work-related injury); Deller v. Naymick, 342 S.E.2d 73 (W. Va. 1985) \r\n  (employee may not sue co-employee doctor for alleged negligence in treatment \r\n  of work-related injury); Franke v. Durkee, 413 N.W.2d 667 (Wis. Ct. App. \r\n  1987) (co-employee doctor is immune from suit under workers' compensation law); \r\n  see also  6 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's Workers' Compensation \r\n  Law Â§ 112.02 [1][b] (1999) (where statute excludes co-employees from range \r\n  of suable third parties, physician employed by same employer as injured employee \r\n  is usually held sheltered by the exclusive-remedy provision).\r\n\r\nWe conclude there is no conflict between the Tort Claims Act and the Workers' \r\n  Compensation Act. Both Acts expressly prohibit a government employee who sustains \r\n  a work-related injury from maintaining a tort action against her government \r\n  employer. While we sympathize with Mrs. Tatum, we are bound by the General Assembly's \r\n  declaration of state policy. \r\n\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The trial judge's order granting \r\n  MUSC's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, is reinstated. McEachern \r\n  v. Black, 329 S.C. 642, 496 S.E.2d 659 (Ct. App. 1998) (trial court's grant \r\n  of motion to dismiss will be sustained if facts alleged in the complaint do \r\n  not support relief under any theory of law).\r\n\r\nREVERSED.  \r\n\r\nMOORE, J., concurs. WALLER, J., concurring in a separate opinion. TOAL, \r\n  C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J. (Concurring in result with the majority): Although \r\n  I am sympathetic to Tatum, I am constrained to concur with the majority opinion. \r\n  Pursuant to S.C. Code Section 42-15-70, it is patent that MUSC is not liable \r\n  for the negligence of its treating physician, and Tatum's exclusive remedy is \r\n  worker's compensation. Accordingly, as the legislature has not indicated an \r\n  intent to allow Tatum to recover in this situation, I must concur with the majority. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, although I am not averse to adoption of the dual persona doctrine, \r\n  I concur with the majority that it would have no application to the present \r\n  case. There is a distinction between the doctrines of dual capacity \r\n  and dual persona. As noted by Professor Larson,\r\n\r\n\r\n  [A dual persona] is quite different than a person acting in \r\n    a capacity other than that of employer. The question is not \r\n    one of activity or relationship- it is one of identity. The Tennessee Supreme \r\n    Court, brushing aside all the fictitious sophistry of 'dual capacity,' nailed \r\n    down this point with breathtaking simplicity:\r\n\r\n  The employer is the employer; not some person other than the employer. It is \r\n    as simple as that. (9) \r\n\r\nThe only way a court can break through this monolithic truism is to resort to a legal fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's Workers' Compensation Law \r\n  Â§ 113.01[2](2000). \r\n\r\nTo hold Tatum may recover in tort from MUSC is, in reality, simply an application \r\n  of the legal fiction known as the dual capacity doctrine, a doctrine sharply \r\n  criticized by Professor Larson, and previously rejected by this Court. Id.; \r\n  Johnson v. Rental Uniform Service of Greenville, 316 S.C. 70, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  184 (1994).\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully dissent. In my opinion, \r\n  the Court of Appeals correctly held that Mrs. Tatum and Mr. Scarborough should \r\n  not be precluded from pursuing these negligence and loss of consortium claims \r\n  in light of the \"dual persona\" doctrine. Once MUSC undertook to act as Mrs. \r\n  Tatum's medical provider, it took on a persona legally distinct from its status \r\n  as her employer. I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, concurs. \r\n1. Tatum holds all hospitals may be held \r\n  liable in tort for the negligence of physicians who treat work-related injuries \r\n  sustained by hospital employees. We have limited our discussion to the law relevant \r\n  to the facts presented by this case. \r\n2. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to -200 (Supp. 2000). \r\n3. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-1-10 to 42-17-90 (1985). \r\n4. Section 42-15-60 permits the employer to furnish the \r\n  treating physician and requires the employee to accept the treating physician, \r\n  unless otherwise ordered by the Workers' Compensation Commission, or compensation \r\n  is barred for the period of refusal. In addition, the employee is barred from \r\n  compensation if he refuses to accept any medical, hospital, surgical or other \r\n  treatment provided by the employer. \r\n5. Presumably, the employer would have a lien on any proceeds \r\n  attributable to the negligence of the third-party physician. Â§ 42-1-560(b) (1985); \r\n  see Hardee v. Bruce Johnson Trucking Co., 293 S.C. 349, 360 S.E.2d \r\n  522 (Ct. App. 1987) (where workers' compensation claimant instituted third-party \r\n  action against physician who allegedly exacerbated work-related injury by negligent \r\n  surgery). \r\n6. See Balancio v. United States, 267 F.2d \r\n  135, 137-138 (2d Cir. 1959), cert. denied  361 U.S. 875 (\" . . . the \r\n  initial wrong is the cause of all that follows, even when there has intervened \r\n  a succeeding negligent act that produced the aggravation.

Rule 407, SCACR, Rule 5.1 (1) \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Overview of Rule 5.1\r\n\r\nRule 5.1 (2) governs the responsibilities of \r\n  partners and lawyers who, directly or indirectly, supervise other lawyers. Attorneys \r\n  in South Carolina do not have \"vicarious liability\" (3) \r\n  for the ethical violations of other attorneys. However, vicarious liability \r\n  is not the issue when a supervised attorney violates the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct. The issue is whether the supervising attorney violated Rule 5.1 by \r\n  failing to satisfy the ethical responsibilities of a partner or supervisory \r\n  lawyer in relation to the other supervised attorney's misconduct. If an attorney \r\n  fails to satisfy the supervisory requirements of Rule 5.1 by actions or omissions, \r\n  that attorney violates the Rules of Professional Conduct and can be sanctioned \r\n  completely separate from any sanction issued for the underlying actions or omissions \r\n  of the supervised attorney. \r\nRule 5.1 addresses three different levels of supervision.  First, under Rule 5.1(c), attorneys will be responsible for another\r\nlawyer's violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if they ratify or fail to mitigate known misconduct committed by an\r\nattorney they supervise.  Second, under Rule 5.1(b), attorneys with \"direct supervisory authority\" over another attorney who\r\nviolates the Rules of Professional Conduct will be disciplined if they failed to \"make reasonable efforts\" in their supervision. \r\nAttorneys can be sanctioned under Rule 5.1(b) even if they had no knowledge of the supervised attorney's inappropriate\r\nbehavior.  Lastly, under Rule 5.1(a), partners in a law firm have a generalized duty to put into place systematic measures to\r\nhelp prevent attorney misconduct.\r\n\r\nB.   Rule 5.1(c)\r\n\r\nRule 5.1(c)(1) and (2) create a heightened form of liability for attorneys.  These sections provide:\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) A lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer's violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if:\r\n\r\n  \r\n(1) The lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or\r\n\r\n(2) The lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices, or has direct supervisory authority over the other\r\nlawyer, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable\r\nremedial action.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  In addition to liability for ordered or ratified misconduct, Rule 5.1(c) requires a law firm partner to take\r\naction or face personal liability when the partner discovers another attorney in the firm has engaged in ethical misconduct. \r\nOnce the partner is on notice of another attorney's misconduct, this subsection imposes a clear duty to take remedial measures\r\nto avoid or mitigate the consequences of that behavior.  Rule 5.1(c)'s liability is not vicarious liability because the obligation\r\ndoes not arise merely from the relationship between the attorneys.  The supervising attorney's ethical violation will be based on\r\nhis participation in the underlying misconduct or his failure to mitigate it.\r\n\r\nC.   Rule 5.1(b)\r\n\r\nUnder Rule 5.1(b), lawyers having \"direct supervisory authority over another lawyer\" are ethically bound to take \"reasonable\r\nefforts\" to ensure that junior lawyers have conformed to the Rules of Professional Conduct.  This subsection provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) A lawyer having direct supervisory authority over another lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other\r\nlawyer conforms to the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the comment explains, \"Professional misconduct by a lawyer under supervision could reveal a violation of paragraph (b) on\r\nthe part of the supervisory lawyer even though it does not entail a violation of paragraph (c) because there was no direction,\r\nratification or knowledge of the violation.\"  Rule 5.1 cmt.  Therefore, in these situations, this Court will sanction an attorney\r\nnot for ordering or ratifying the underlying violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, but because as a lawyer with \"direct\r\nsupervisory authority over another lawyer\" the attorney failed to \"make reasonable efforts\" to ensure the supervised attorney\r\nconformed to the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\nIn order to sanction an attorney under this subsection, this Court must make three separate findings:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) The attorney in question was a lawyer with \"direct supervisory authority\" over the offending attorney;\r\n\r\n(2) The supervised attorney failed to conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct; (4) and\r\n\r\n(3) The supervising attorney failed to \"make reasonable efforts\" in an attempt to ensure the supervised attorney followed the\r\nRules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Direct Supervisory Authority\r\n\r\nA close examination of each case will determine whether an attorney had direct supervisory authority over another.  \"Whether\r\na lawyer has such supervisory authority in particular circumstances is a question of fact.\"  Rule 5.1 cmt.  In the past, this Court\r\nhas found a violation of Rule 5.1 where a senior attorney handed over the entire discovery process to an associate who then\r\nviolated the Rules of Professional Conduct.  See In the Matter of Moore, 329 S.C. 294, 494 S.E.2d 804 (1997).  As this case\r\nillustrates, Rule 5.1 does not require that an attorney be the day-to-day supervisor of\r\nthe attorney committing the misconduct to\r\ncreate liability.  The key to liability is whether there was authority over the violating attorney.\r\n\r\n2.   Reasonable Efforts\r\n\r\nAs noted by the comment to Rule 5.1:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe measures required to fulfill the responsibility prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) can depend on the firm's structure and\r\nthe nature of its practice. In a small firm, informal supervision and occasional admonition ordinarily might be sufficient. In a\r\nlarge firm, or in practice situations in which intensely difficult ethical problems frequently arise, more elaborate procedures\r\nmay be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 5.1 cmt.  This comment makes clear that a senior attorney in a large firm has an even greater responsibility than an\r\nattorney in a smaller practice to enact formal office procedures to ensure compliance with the Rules of Professional conduct. \r\nFurthermore, attorneys who attempt to shield themselves from any direct liability under Rule 5.1(c) by distancing themselves\r\nfrom attorneys under their direct supervisory authority may find themselves guilty of a failure to properly supervise under Rule\r\n5.1(b).\r\n\r\nAs stated in the comment to Rule 5.1, \"Partners of a private firm have at least indirect responsibility for all work being done by\r\nthe firm . . .\"  Rule 5.1 cmt. (emphasis added).  Again, this section does not establish a vicarious liability standard where\r\nsupervisory attorneys will be sanctioned every time another attorney violates the Rules of Professional Conduct.  Under Rule\r\n5.1(b), supervisory attorneys can employ many different procedures depending on the size of the firm to review the work of\r\ntheir subordinates and effectively meet their responsibilities recognized by Rule 5.1.  \r\n\r\nD.   Rule 5.1(a)\r\n\r\nRule 5.1(a) establishes that all partners in a law firm have a generalized responsibility for the actions of other members in their\r\nfirm.  The rule states:\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) A partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable\r\nassurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, all partners in a law firm, no matter the size, have at least indirect responsibility for the work done by the\r\nfirm.  See Rule 5.1 cmt.  The liability here is not vicarious liability for the unethical conduct of another attorney, instead this\r\nsubsection places on all partners a responsibility for enacting measures that give \"reasonable assurance\" that the firm's\r\nattorneys will abide by their ethical responsibilities.\r\n\r\nRule 5.1(a) promotes several goals of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  First, by recognizing that senior attorneys have some\r\nresponsibility for all the work done by their partners and subordinates, senior attorneys in charge are encouraged to construct\r\nmechanisms to prevent younger partners and associates from facing an ethical \"sink or swim\" office mentality.  In these\r\nunhealthy situations, less experienced lawyers are left alone with little or no guidance from senior attorneys.  Senior partners\r\ncan either establish office procedures to assist new associates when they face ethical questions or they may face sanctions under\r\nthis subsection.  As a New Jersey Supreme Court Justice has noted: \"It is not enough that the principals be available if needed. \r\nThis sorry episode points up the need for a systematic, organized routine for periodic review of a newly admitted attorney's\r\nfiles.\"  In re Barry, 447 A.2d 923, 926 (N.J. 1982)(Clifford, J., dissenting).   \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the rule recognizes that \"the ethical atmosphere of a firm can influence the conduct of all its members . . . .\"  Rule\r\n5.1 cmt.  By placing some responsibility on the senior management of a firm, the rule prevents those attorneys who have the\r\nmost influence over the atmosphere of the firm from turning a blind eye to the behavior of the firm's attorneys.  While partners\r\nare not required to guarantee that other attorneys in their firm will not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, ignoring their\r\nsupervisory responsibilities can lead to sanctions for those running the firm.\r\n\r\nUndoubtably, the supervision of attorneys by other attorneys in their firm is one of the most effective methods of preventing\r\nattorney misconduct.  However, that supervision must be reasonably competent or it is meaningless and that failure in itself can\r\nencourage unethical behavior. (5)  In situations where supervising attorneys fail to make reasonable efforts to ensure their\r\nsubordinates follow the Rules of Professional Conduct, if the disciplinary proceedings only punished the individual attorney\r\nwho committed the violation, the environment that fostered the attorney's unethical conduct would be allowed to continue.\r\n\r\nWhen an attorney has allegedly violated Rule 5.1, it is not a complete defense to prove that the attorney did not know about the\r\nunderlying misconduct.   This Court looks to see if the attorney took reasonable measures in supervising the subordinate\r\nattorney.  In fact, a complete lack of knowledge can lead to a finding of poor supervision if the subordinate's violation is such\r\nthat reasonable supervision would have discovered it.  However, Rule 5.1 does not mean that in every situation where an\r\nattorney in a firm violates the duties of professional responsibility other attorneys in the firm will find themselves sanctioned. \r\nIn fact, partners in a law firm can implement many varied procedures and policies based on the size of the firm to effectively\r\nmeet their responsibilities recognized by Rule 5.1 and therefore protect themselves from exposure under this provision.\r\n\r\nII.     Deposition Conduct\r\n\r\n\r\nWe take this opportunity to alert the bar to the enactment of Rule 30(j), SCRCP and to address attorney conduct in depositions\r\nin general so that attorneys in South Carolina will be aware of what actions can result in sanctions both by the trial court under\r\nthe South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and by this Court under the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\nA.  New Rule 30(j), SCRCP\r\n\r\n\"A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for the\r\nquality of justice.\" Rule 407, SCACR pmbl.  In depositions attorneys may face the greatest conflict between their obligations to\r\nthe court and opposing counsel under Rule 3.4, (6) and their obligations to their own client under Rule 1.3. (7)  Since depositions\r\nalmost always occur without direct judicial supervision, lawyers must regulate themselves during this highly critical stage of\r\nlitigation.  In the past, this Court has sanctioned attorneys who have failed to properly conduct themselves during depositions. \r\nSee Matter of Golden, 329 S.C. 335, 496 S.E.2d 619 (1998).  In addition to subjecting themselves to possible ethical sanctions,\r\nattorneys who engage in misconduct during depositions may find themselves sanctioned by the trial court as well.  See Rule 37,\r\nSCRCP. \r\n\r\nRule 30(j), SCRCP, is nearly identical to the guidelines used in federal district court in South Carolina.  The rule states:\r\n\r\nConduct During Depositions\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) At the beginning of each deposition, deposing counsel shall instruct the witness to ask deposing counsel, rather than the\r\nwitness' own counsel, for clarifications, definitions, or explanations of any words, questions or documents presented during the\r\ncourse of the deposition. The witness shall abide by these instructions.\r\n\r\n(2) All objections, except those which would be waived if not made at the deposition under Rule 32(d)(3), SCRCP, and those\r\nnecessary to assert a privilege, to enforce a limitation on evidence directed by the Court, or to present a motion pursuant to\r\nRule 30(d), SCRCP, shall be preserved.\r\n\r\n(3) Counsel shall not direct or request that a witness not answer a question, unless that counsel has objected to the question on\r\nthe ground that the answer is protected by a privilege (8) or a limitation on evidence directed by the court or unless that counsel\r\nintends to present a motion under Rule 30(d), SCRCP. In addition, counsel shall have an affirmative duty to inform a witness\r\nthat, unless such an objection is made, the question must be answered. Counsel directing that a witness not answer a question\r\non those grounds or allowing a witness to refuse to answer a question on those grounds shall move the court for a protective\r\norder under Rule 26(c), SCRCP, or 30(d), SCRCP, within five business days of the suspension or termination of the deposition.\r\nFailure to timely file such a motion will constitute waiver of the objection, and the deposition may be reconvened.\r\n\r\n(4) Counsel shall not make objections or statements which might suggest an answer to a witness. Counsel's objections shall be\r\nstated concisely and in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive manner, stating the basis of the objection and nothing more.\r\n\r\n(5) Counsel and a witness shall not engage in private, off-the-record conferences during depositions or during breaks or\r\nrecesses regarding the substance of the testimony at the deposition, except for the purpose of deciding whether to assert a\r\nprivilege or to make an objection or to move for a protective order.\r\n\r\n(6) Any conferences which occur pursuant to, or in violation of, section (5) of this rule are proper subjects for inquiry by\r\ndeposing counsel to ascertain whether there has been any witness coaching and, if so, to what extent and nature.\r\n\r\n(7) Any conferences which occur pursuant to, or in violation of, section (5) of this rule shall be noted on the record by the\r\ncounsel who participated in the conference. The purpose and outcome of the conference shall be noted on the record.\r\n\r\n(8) Deposing counsel shall provide to opposing counsel a copy of all documents shown to the witness during the deposition,\r\neither before the deposition begins or contemporaneously with the showing of each document to the witness. If the documents\r\nare provided (or otherwise identified) at least two business days before the deposition, then the witness and the witness' counsel\r\ndo not have the right to discuss the documents privately before the witness answers questions about them. If the documents\r\nhave not been so provided or identified, then counsel and the witness may have a reasonable amount of time to discuss the\r\ndocuments before the witness answers questions concerning the document.\r\n\r\n(9) Violation of this rule may subject the violator to sanctions under Rule 37, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Rule 30(j), SCRCP, is derived from Judge Robert S. Gawthrop's seminal opinion in Hall v. Clifton Precision, 150 F.R.D.\r\n525 (E.D. Pa. 1993).  Having adopted the Hall approach, our Court requires attorneys in South Carolina to operate under one of\r\nthe most sweeping and comprehensive rules on deposition conduct in the nation.  \r\n\r\nB.   Off-the-Record Conferences \r\n\r\nRule 30(j), SCRCP, makes clear that a deposition's beginning signals the end of a witness's preparation.  Once a deposition\r\nbegins, an attorney and a client may have an off-the-record conference only when deciding whether to assert a privilege or to\r\ndiscuss a previously undisclosed document.  See Rule 30(j)(5), SCRCP; Rule 30(j)(8), SCRCP.  Before beginning such a\r\nconference, the deponent's attorney should note for the record that a break is needed to discuss the possible assertion of a\r\nprivilege or a newly produced document.  After any such conference, the conferencing attorney should state on the record why\r\nthe conference occurred and the decision reached.  If the party decides to assert a privilege, the basis for the privilege should be\r\nclearly stated.  Whether or not a privilege is asserted, deposing counsel may inquire on the record into the subject of the\r\nconference to determine if there has been any witness coaching.  See Rule 30(j)(6), SCRCP.  Conferences called to assist a\r\nclient in framing an answer, to calm down a nervous client, or to interrupt the flow of a deposition are improper and warrant\r\nsanctions.  \r\n\r\nOff-the-record conferences not specifically permitted by the rule are not allowed whether they are called by the deponent's\r\nattorney or the deponent.  \"There is simply no qualitative distinction between private conferences initiated by a lawyer and\r\nthose initiated by a witness.  Neither should occur.\"  Hall, 150 F.R.D. at 528.  According to our rule, even during breaks in the\r\ndeposition such as a lunch or overnight break, witnesses and their counsel cannot talk substantively about prior or future\r\ntestimony in the deposition.  See Rule 30(j)(5), SCRCP.\r\n\r\nC.   Suggestive Objections and Interjections\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent witness coaching during depositions, the rule prohibits lengthy \"speaking\" objections and brief suggestive\r\ninterjections.  As noted by Judge Gawthrop in Hall, the rules of evidence \"contain no provision allowing lawyers to interrupt\r\nthe trial testimony of a witness to make a statement. Such behavior should likewise be prohibited at depositions, since it tends\r\nto obstruct the taking of the witness's testimony.\"  Hall, 150 F.R.D. at 530; see also Rule 30(c), SCRCP (\"Examination and\r\ncross-examination of witnesses may proceed as permitted at the trial under the provisions of the South Carolina Rules of\r\nEvidence . . .\").  Therefore, interjections during a deposition by the witness's attorney such as \"if you remember\" and \"don't\r\nspeculate\" are improper because they suggest to the witness how to answer the question.  Attorneys can easily make these\r\nadmonitions to their client before the deposition begins.  As summarized by Judge Gawthrop:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe underlying purpose of a deposition is to find out what a witness saw, heard, or did--what the witness thinks. A deposition\r\nis meant to be a question-and-answer conversation between the deposing lawyer and the witness. There is no proper need for\r\nthe witness's own lawyer to act as an intermediary, interpreting questions, deciding which questions the witness should answer,\r\nand helping the witness to formulate answers. The witness comes to the deposition to testify, not to indulge in a parody of\r\nCharlie McCarthy, with lawyers coaching or bending the witness's words to mold a legally convenient record. It is the\r\nwitness--not the lawyer--who is the witness.\r\n\r\n\r\nHall, 150 F.R.D. at 528.  \r\n\r\nRule 30(j)(1), SCRCP also directs the deponent to look to the attorney asking the question, not the witness's own counsel, for\r\nany clarifications or explanations.  A witness's attorney cannot object to a question just because the attorney does not\r\nunderstand the question.  See Hall, 150 F.R.D. at 530 n. 10.  Furthermore, it is improper for counsel to state for the record their\r\ninterpretations of questions, since such interpretations are completely irrelevant and improperly suggestive to the deponent.  Id. \r\nA witness's attorney must also refrain from rephrasing questions for the witness.\r\n\r\nD.  Instructions Not to Answer\r\n\r\nNew Rule 30(j), SCRCP, also limits when an attorney may advise a witness not to answer a question during a deposition.  The\r\nonly circumstances under which an attorney may instruct the witness not to answer a question in a deposition are: (1) when\r\ncounsel has objected to the question on the ground that the answer is protected by a privilege; (2) when the information sought\r\nis protected by a limitation on evidence directed by the court; and (3) when the witness's counsel intends to present a motion\r\nunder Rule 30(d), SCRCP (witness harassment).  See Rule 30(j)(3), SCACR.  The rule even requires attorneys to affirmatively\r\ndirect their witnesses to answer a question unless they make one of these objections.  Id.    \r\n\r\nOn this point, instructing a witness not to respond to a question because it has been \"asked and answered\" will generally be\r\nimproper.  No rule prevents a deposing attorney from asking the same question more that one time or different variances of the\r\nsame question.  The witness's attorney can question the witness after the opponent's examination is done to clarify any\r\nconfusion brought about by the witness's answers.  An attorney may use the \"asked and answered\" objection without an\r\ninstruction not to answer the question to establish a record of abuse where the attorney believes the questioning is approaching\r\nthe level of harassment.  If repetitive questioning reaches the point of harassment, the witness's attorney should make a motion\r\nunder Rule 30(d), SCRCP.\r\n\r\nE.   Handling Discovery Abuse in Depositions\r\n\r\n\"The primary objective of discovery is to ensure that lawsuits are decided by what the facts reveal, not by what facts are\r\nconcealed.\" In re Alford Chevrolet-Geo, 997 S.W.2d 173, 180 (Tex. 1999).  The entire thrust of our discovery rules involves\r\nfull and fair disclosure, to prevent a trial from becoming a guessing game or one of surprise for either party.  Samples v.\r\nMitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 495 S.E.2d 213 (Ct. App. 1997).  In this respect, the discovery process is designed to \"make a trial less\r\na game of blind man's bluff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable extent.\" \r\nSee United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S. Ct. 983, 986-87 (1958).\r\n\r\nDepositions are widely recognized as one of the \"most powerful and productive\" devices used in discovery.  See A. Darby\r\nDickerson, The Law and Ethics of Civil Depositions, 57 Md. L. Rev. 273, 277 (1998).  Since depositions are so important in\r\nlitigation, attorneys face great temptation to cross the limits of acceptable behavior in order to win the case at the expense of\r\ntheir ethical responsibilities to the court and their fellow attorneys.  Claiming that any such improper behavior was merely\r\n\"zealous advocacy\" will not justify discovery abuse.  When attorneys cross the line during a deposition, their actions do not\r\npromote the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\"  See Rule 1, SCRCP.\r\n\r\nActions taken in a deposition designed to prevent justice, delay the process, or drive up costs are improper and warrant\r\nsanctions.  In South Carolina, our judges have broad discretion in addressing misbehavior during depositions.  See Rule 37,\r\nSCRCP.  In addition to their traditional contempt powers, judges may issue orders as a sanction for improper deposition\r\nconduct: (1) specifying that designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action; (2) precluding the introduction\r\nof certain evidence at trial; (3) striking out pleadings or parts thereof; (4) staying further proceedings pending the compliance\r\nwith an order that has not been followed; (5) dismissing the action in full or in part; (6) entering default judgment on some or\r\nall the claims; or (7) an award of reasonable expenses, including attorney fees.  Id.  Among the costs a judge may deem\r\nappropriate could be those incurred for future judicial monitoring of depositions or payment for the retaking of depositions. \r\nOur judges must use their authority to make sure that abusive deposition tactics and other forms of discovery abuse do not\r\nsucceed in their ultimate goal: achieving success through abuse of the discovery rules rather than by the rule of law.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice C. Victor \r\n  Pyle, Jr., concur. \r\n1. Rule 407, SCACR contains the South Carolina Rules of \r\n  Professional Conduct. Rule 407, SCACR is where Rule 5.1 and the other Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct referenced in this opinion may be found. \r\n2. The full text of Rule 5.1 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE 5.1. RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PARTNER OR SUPERVISORY LAWYER\r\n\r\n  (a) A partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the \r\n    firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in \r\n    the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\n  (b) A lawyer having direct supervisory authority over another lawyer shall \r\n    make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyer conforms to the Rules \r\n    of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\n  (c) A lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer's violation of the Rules \r\n    of Professional Conduct if:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1) The lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies \r\n      the conduct involved; or\r\n\r\n    (2) The lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices, \r\n      or has direct supervisory authority over the other lawyer, and knows of \r\n      the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated \r\n      but fails to take reasonable remedial action.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Vicarious Liability.  Liability that \r\n  a supervisory party (such as an employer) bears for the actionable conduct of \r\n  a subordinate or associate (such as an employee) because of the relationship \r\n  between the two parties. Black's Law Dictionary 927 (7th \r\n  ed. 1999). \r\n4. In some situations, the actions of several supervised \r\n  attorneys when taken together may result in a violation of the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct even where their individual actions do not rise to the level of a violation. \r\n5. Individual attorneys in a firm do not operate in an ethical \r\n  vacuum. Studies have revealed that \"an attorney's willingness to violate legal \r\n  or professional rules depends heavily on the exposures to temptation, client \r\n  pressures, and collegial attitudes in his practice setting.\" Deborah \r\n  Rhode, Moral Character as a Professional Credential, 94 Yale L.J. 491, \r\n  559 (1985)(emphasis added). \r\n6. \"A lawyer shall not:\r\n\r\n(a) Unlawfully obstruct another party's access to evidence . . .;\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n\r\n(d) In pretrial procedure, make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make \r\n  a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request \r\n  by an opposing party.\" Rule 3.4, Rule 407, SCACR. \r\n7. \"A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness \r\n  in representing a client.\" Rule 1.3., Rule 407, SCACR. The comment to this rule \r\n  states \"A lawyer should act with commitment and dedication to the interests \r\n  of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client's behalf.\" \r\n8.

Haile, \r\n          of S.C. Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n\r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy \r\n          Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General \r\n          Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters; and \r\n          Solicitor Warren B. Giese, all of Columbia for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: \r\n  Appellant was charged with the 1996 armed robbery and execution-style shooting \r\n  of three victims at Kelly's Barbershop in Columbia. One victim survived the \r\n  shooting and identified appellant as the perpetrator. The State sought the death \r\n  penalty. The jury found appellant guilty of three counts of armed robbery, three \r\n  counts of kidnaping, two counts of murder, and one count of assault and battery \r\n  with intent to kill but did not recommend death. The trial judge sentenced appellant \r\n  to consecutive terms of thirty years for each armed robbery, thirty years for \r\n  the kidnaping of the surviving victim, life without parole for each murder, \r\n  and twenty years for assault and battery with intent to kill. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKendrick Davis worked as a barber at Kelly's. On \r\n  the morning of March 14, 1996, he arrived at work around 6:10 a.m. Mr. Kelly \r\n  was already cutting a customer's hair and another customer, Leon Poole, was \r\n  waiting. After confirming that Mr. Poole did not need his services, Davis sat \r\n  down with a cup of coffee to read the newspaper. As Mr. Kelly's first customer \r\n  was walking out the door, Davis overheard someone ask for the time. A few minutes \r\n  later, Davis lowered his newspaper and saw a black man wearing a toboggan cap \r\n  standing in front of him with a gun. The man told him it was a holdup and instructed \r\n  him to get up and go to the back room. At trial, Davis identified the man as \r\n  appellant.\r\n\r\nDavis tapped Mr. Kelly on the shoulder and told \r\n  him they were being robbed. Mr. Kelly and Mr. Poole, who were both in their \r\n  70's, were slow-moving. Davis led them to the back room which was very small \r\n  and narrow. When they reached the back room, appellant ordered them back to \r\n  the front where he told them to get on their knees and throw their wallets out \r\n  on the floor. At this point, appellant pulled his cap down over his face. Mr. \r\n  Kelly fumbled getting his wallet out and appellant ordered them to hurry up. \r\n  Finally, appellant told them to get up and go back to the room at the back of \r\n  the shop. Davis again led the way.\r\n\r\nAppellant ordered the three men onto their knees \r\n  with their hands behind their heads. Davis heard one shot, then another. The \r\n  third shot struck him in the left thumb and the back of the neck. Davis lay \r\n  on the floor and waited there several minutes. Mr. Poole, who weighed about \r\n  200 pounds, had fallen on top of him and they were all three lying in a pool \r\n  of blood. Davis had some difficulty getting up but he was finally able to reach \r\n  the telephone and dial 911. \r\n\r\nPolice arrived shortly thereafter and transported \r\n  Davis to the hospital where he was interviewed almost immediately. Davis gave \r\n  a description of the assailant as a black male in his mid-twenties, medium build, \r\n  about 5'10\". He gave a similar description later that day except he added that \r\n  the perpetrator had a thin mustache. On March 15, Davis met with a forensic \r\n  artist who developed a composite drawing based on Davis's description of the \r\n  assailant. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, SLED analyzed three bullets from the \r\n  barbershop crime scene and concluded they had been shot from the same gun that \r\n  was used to kill a cab driver at a shopping mall in Richland County on February \r\n  19. \r\n\r\nDuring this time, appellant was living with his \r\n  sister, Glenda Love, in Eau Claire. He moved in with her after his release from \r\n  prison on February 2, 1996. Appellant, who was an aspiring rap artist, had legally \r\n  changed his name to \"King Justice.\" He worked part-time for a janitorial service.\r\n\r\nAppellant was not at home in the early morning \r\n  hours of March 14. Love did not speak with him until early that evening when \r\n  he asked if she had heard about the barbershop shooting. During the next few \r\n  days, Love noticed a newspaper article about the killings in which someone had \r\n  highlighted the words \"execution style.\" She noticed that other articles had \r\n  been clipped from her newspapers. \r\n\r\nLove saw the composite drawing of the suspect in \r\n  the paper and thought it looked like appellant. She also thought the description \r\n  of the hat and coat worn by the suspect matched appellant's. At some point, \r\n  she found shoes wrapped up in a brown leather jacket. Finally, on March 27, \r\n  she found a gun in a shopping bag in her house. \r\n\r\nLove became alarmed and alerted police. The next \r\n  day, March 28, police executed a search warrant at the Love residence but found \r\n  nothing relevant except the newspaper clippings and a ski cap with two holes \r\n  in it. Love testified she never saw the gun again. \r\n\r\nNothing further happened in the investigation of \r\n  this case until October 1996. On October 3, officers executed a search warrant \r\n  in an unrelated case at the residence of Lamont Hilliard on House Street in \r\n  Columbia. They were looking for stolen goods reportedly at that location. During \r\n  the search, police confiscated a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson handgun. SLED \r\n  subsequently matched this gun to the bullets from the barbershop and cab driver \r\n  murders. \r\n\r\nAs a result, Lamont Hilliard was interviewed by \r\n  police. Hilliard told police he got the gun from Bernard Johnson in May 1996. \r\n  Police then interviewed Bernard Johnson who stated he bought the gun on the \r\n  street in November 1995 and gave it to appellant shortly after appellant got \r\n  out of prison around the end of January 1996. Appellant returned the gun to \r\n  Johnson in May or June 1996, and Johnson left it with Hilliard. Johnson told \r\n  police appellant said he had used the gun to commit the barbershop murders. \r\n   (1)\r\n\r\nThe same day Johnson was interviewed, police had \r\n  appellant transported from Greenville where he was incarcerated on another charge. \r\n  Appellant admitted receiving Johnson's .38 in February of 1996 but claimed not \r\n  to remember how long he had possessed it. \r\n\r\nPolice then executed a search warrant at Glenda \r\n  Love's residence where appellant had been living. They found the name \"Virgil \r\n  Howard\" on some letters addressed to appellant and ascertained that Virgil Howard \r\n  was an inmate. Prison officials then confiscated letters written by appellant \r\n  from Howard's cell. Appellant stipulated he wrote these letters. The first letter \r\n  reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yo, Peace G, I got everything, even two letters \r\n    from you. Things have been slow, but send them flicks because next time you \r\n    write, my check will be cashed by then. I'm working with a janitorial service, \r\n    so I can pay the payroll officers. Bust it. You know this shit ain't me. I \r\n    got to have a backup when my licks don't go over. Read my last letter, you'll \r\n    see where I told you about the Cee-Allah-Born. That didn't come out right \r\n    because he tried to stag, so I sent him to the essence. You've heard about \r\n    it. It was the one down by the mall last month. . . . Now that I got my God-U-Now \r\n    back, I'm about to get busy tonight, March 1st. . . I $300 (sic) \r\n    for the demo tape, so someone's got to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement officials familiar with a code \r\n  used by inmates testified that \"Cee-Allah-Born\" means \"cab,\" \"God-U-Now\" means \r\n  \"gun,\" \"licks\" means robbery, and \"to stag\" means \"to resist.\" There was only \r\n  one cab driver murder in the first three months of 1996 and it was the one matched \r\n  to the .38. \r\n\r\n\r\n  The second letter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  Yo, Peace G, Yo, Black, I'm telling you, shit ain't \r\n    so swift as I thought. The licks that I thought were going to put me on turn \r\n    out to be locked down with Self-Allah-Father-Equality. So I just got small \r\n    change. But I'm about to make a mad move Tuesday night 20th, that's \r\n    going to put me on or put me away. Things are looking up for my music goals. \r\n    I'm meeting with this kid that works in the music department for Black Newspaper. \r\n    He gone to the Soul Train Music Awards, but he'll be back Monday. . . . I've \r\n    got this bull-shitting job so I can buy some things for my capers on them \r\n    devils Tuesday. The lyrics aren't all that sharp, but the beat is going to \r\n    be the shit. I had to leave your stuff in my folder in the jail with this \r\n    God Body because I was licking that night, but I'm sending for it now. Write \r\n    Shabazz and tell him what's up but keep the caper between us, all right? Yo, \r\n    Black, hang in there with me. I'm striving hard to get on and stay out at \r\n    the same time. So I haven't forgot you, I've just been making a lot of moves. \r\n    Write when you get this. Peace, King Justice.\r\n\r\n  I got the stamps and envelopes from a lick I made. \r\n    If I send one too many, just keep it for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement translated \"Self-Allah-Father-Equality\" \r\n  as meaning \"safe.\" There was an unopened safe at the barbershop. \r\n\r\nFinally, inmate Dan Temple testified that appellant \r\n  told him while they were incarcerated together that he (appellant) was charged \r\n  with the barbershop murders, that one of the victims had lived, and that he \r\n  wished he had shot him again. \r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Destruction of gun \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the murder weapon and any testimony \r\n  regarding it should have been suppressed, or the indictments against him dismissed, \r\n  because the gun was destroyed before the defense team could examine it. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe State presented the following evidence at a \r\n  pre-trial hearing. Officer Conyers of the Columbia Police Department, who confiscated \r\n  the gun from Hilliard's residence on October 3, 1996, checked over a four-day \r\n  period for a report that it was stolen. When her check turned up no owner, she \r\n  tagged the gun \"destroy or sell\" and placed it in the evidence room. All this \r\n  was done pursuant to normal department procedures. \r\n\r\nOn October 16, the gun was transported to SLED \r\n  for testing in an unrelated shooting case. The next day, Agent Paavel test-fired \r\n  the gun and discovered that the markings on the test-fired bullets matched the \r\n  markings on the bullets from the barbershop and cab driver killings. He took \r\n  photographs of the gun, including the serial number, and reported his test results \r\n  to the Columbia Police Department and the Richland County Sheriff's Office. \r\n  Agent Paavel kept the bullets retrieved from the two murder scenes and the test-fired \r\n  bullets but eventually returned the gun to the Columbia Police Department. He \r\n  put the gun in an envelope, marked the envelope \"do not destroy,\" and indicated \r\n  it contained the barbershop murder weapon. \r\n\r\nOfficer Lewis of the Columbia Police Department \r\n  testified she received the gun back from SLED on March 4, 1997. It still had \r\n  the original Columbia Police Department tag indicating no owner. There was nothing \r\n  indicating it was related to the barbershop murders. Following normal procedures, \r\n  Officer Lewis advertised the gun in the newspaper as unclaimed property. Finally, \r\n  on May 20, it was destroyed with a group of 140 weapons. \r\n\r\nThe trial judge denied appellant's motions for \r\n  suppression or dismissal of the indictments ruling there was no bad faith in \r\n  the destruction of the gun, the bullets were still available to the defense, \r\n  and there was no prejudice to the defense because the gun was incriminating \r\n  rather than exculpatory. The evidence regarding the care of the gun by police \r\n  was introduced at trial and the jury was charged at the close of the case that \r\n  the evidence was introduced \"as to the issue of the degree of care exercised \r\n  by the agents of Columbia Police Department charged with the custody and preservation \r\n  of evidence.\" \r\n\r\nWe find no error in the trial judge's ruling. The \r\n  State does not have an absolute duty to preserve potentially useful evidence \r\n  that might exonerate a defendant. Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988); \r\n  State v. Mabe, 306 S.C. 355, 412 S.E.2d 386 (1991); State v. Jackson, 302 S.C. \r\n  313, 396 S.E.2d 101 (1990). To establish a due process violation, a defendant \r\n  must demonstrate (1) that the State destroyed the evidence in bad faith, or \r\n  (2) that the evidence possessed an exculpatory value apparent before the evidence \r\n  was destroyed and the defendant cannot obtain other evidence of comparable value \r\n  by other means. State v. Mabe, supra; State v. Jackson, supra.\r\n\r\nAppellant has failed to demonstrate any evidence \r\n  of bad faith. The Columbia police officers testified they followed normal procedures \r\n  in destroying the gun and there was no indication on the gun connecting it to \r\n  the barbershop murders at the time of its destruction. While there is evidence \r\n  of a lack of care, there is no evidence of an intentional destruction of relevant \r\n  evidence in this case.\r\n\r\nFurther, appellant has not demonstrated in the \r\n  alternative that the gun had exculpatory value that was apparent before it was \r\n  destroyed. Appellant's expert testified the actual gun rather than the photographs \r\n  of it should have been presented to the witnesses for identification. None of \r\n  the witnesses, however, including appellant at the time he gave his statement, \r\n  expressed any doubt that the gun in the photographs was the gun given to appellant. \r\n  Further, Agent Paavel definitively identified the murder weapon as the gun in \r\n  the photographs. There is no evidence of any apparent exculpatory value especially \r\n  given the fact that the gun was recovered months after the crime and fingerprints \r\n  were not an issue.\r\n\r\nFinally, all of Agent Paavel's reports and the \r\n  documentation of his microscopic comparison of the bullets from the murder scene \r\n  with the test bullets fired from the gun, in addition to the bullets themselves, \r\n  were available to the defense. Accordingly, comparable evidence was available \r\n  from a source other than the gun.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge properly denied appellant's motions \r\n  on this ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. Kendrick Davis's identification of appellant \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant moved to suppress Kendrick Davis's identification \r\n  on the grounds it was tainted by an unreliable hypnosis session and appellant \r\n  was deprived of his right of confrontation. The trial judge denied the motion \r\n  following a pre-trial hearing.\r\n\r\nKendrick Davis, the surviving victim of the barbershop \r\n  shootings, gave a description of the perpetrator to police the day of the murders. \r\n  The next day, March 15, 1996, Davis worked with a forensic artist who developed \r\n  a composite drawing based on Davis's description. On April 5, Davis was shown \r\n  a photographic line-up with six subjects approximating the description he had \r\n  given. He failed to identify any of them as the perpetrator. \r\n\r\nOn May 14, Davis met with a hypnotist, Robert Sauer, \r\n  who explained the procedure that would be used and introduced Davis to relaxation \r\n  techniques. At a second session on May 21, Davis was accompanied by a police \r\n  officer and a second forensic artist. Davis gave a description of the assailant \r\n  and a second composite drawing was made. No pictures, other than the composite \r\n  itself, or photographs were shown to Davis during the session. \r\n\r\nFive months later, on October 22, Davis was shown \r\n  a second photographic line-up in which he identified appellant as the perpetrator. \r\n  Detective Mead, who was present, testified Davis became very emotional when \r\n  he saw appellant's photo and exclaimed he would never forget appellant's face. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAppellant first contends Davis's identification \r\n  was rendered unduly suggestive by the hypnosis session on May 21. An in-court \r\n  identification of an accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court identification \r\n  procedure created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. \r\n  Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977); State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 272 \r\n  S.E.2d 628 (1980). To determine the admissibility of an identification, the \r\n  court must determine (1) whether the identification process was unduly suggestive \r\n  and (2) if so, whether the out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable \r\n  that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed. Neil v. Biggers, \r\n  409 U.S. 188 (1972); State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 540 S.E.2d 445 (2000).\r\n\r\nIn this case, under the first prong, there is no \r\n  evidence the hypnosis session rendered the identification process unduly suggestive. \r\n  The transcript of the session reveals nothing coercive in the dialogue between \r\n  Davis and the hypnotist. Appellant complains there is a ten-minute gap in the \r\n  tape of the session during which \"suggestability violations,\" such as showing \r\n  appellant's photograph, could have taken place. The hypnotist explained the \r\n  ten-minute gap was caused by his inadvertent failure to turn on the volume at \r\n  the beginning of the third tape while he was recording the session. Officer \r\n  Mead, who accompanied Davis, testified that Davis was not shown any photographs \r\n  and that the second composite was based entirely on Davis's description of the \r\n  suspect. Finally, we have examined the composite drawing based on Davis's pre-hypnosis \r\n  description and the one drawn during the hypnosis session and find them remarkably \r\n  similar. \r\n\r\nMoreover, even if the procedure used was unduly \r\n  suggestive, there is no substantial likelihood of misidentification under the \r\n  second prong of the Neil v. Biggers analysis. The following factors are to be \r\n  considered in evaluating the totality of the circumstances to determine the \r\n  likelihood of a misidentification: (1) the witness's opportunity to view the \r\n  perpetrator at the time of the crime (2) the witness's degree of attention (3) \r\n  the accuracy of the witness's prior description of the criminal (4) the level \r\n  of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation and (5) the length \r\n  of time between the crime and the confrontation. State v. Moore, supra.\r\n\r\nHere, Davis saw the perpetrator face-to-face in \r\n  a well-lit place for several minutes, Davis had a gun pointed at him at the \r\n  time and was paying very close attention, his description consistently matched \r\n  appellant, he expressed absolutely no doubt about his identification of appellant \r\n  at the photographic line-up, and the time between the crime and the line-up \r\n  was about seven months. Under these circumstances, the trial judge did not abuse \r\n  his discretion in refusing to suppress Davis's identification of appellant. \r\n  Id. (decision to admit eyewitness identification is within trial judge's \r\n  discretion); accord Harker v. Maryland, 800 F.2d 437 (4th Cir. 1986) \r\n  (consistency of eyewitness's description before, during, and after hypnosis \r\n  provided ample basis for witness to testify before jury).\r\n\r\nNext, appellant contends the use of post-hypnotic \r\n  evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation under State v. \r\n  Evans, 316 S.C. 303, 450 S.E.2d 47 (1994). To determine whether the admission \r\n  of post-hypnotic testimony violates the Confrontation Clause, we must consider \r\n  whether the hypnosis affected the witness's ability to testify and respond freely \r\n  to cross-examination. Id. (citing McQueen v. Garrison, 814 \r\n  F.2d 951, 958 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 944 (1987)). In determining \r\n  whether post-hypnotic testimony is independent of the dangers associated with \r\n  hypnosis, we will consider whether (1) the witness's trial testimony was generally \r\n  consistent with pre-hypnotic statements (2) considerable circumstantial evidence \r\n  corroborated the witness's post-hypnotic testimony and (3) the witness's responses \r\n  to examination by counsel generally were not the automatic responses of a pre-conditioned \r\n  mental process.\r\n\r\nDavis's identification of appellant at trial was \r\n  consistent with his pre-hypnotic description of the assailant. The identification \r\n  was corroborated by evidence appellant was in possession of the murder weapon \r\n  at the time of the barbershop murders and that he confessed to both Bernard \r\n  Johnson and Dan Temple. Davis was cross-examined extensively about his identification \r\n  and admitted there were some details he could not recall, such as whether the \r\n  assailant was wearing gloves or what kind of shoes he had on. His responses \r\n  to questioning give no indication of being pre-conditioned. Further, appellant \r\n  presented expert testimony and fully argued the unreliability of Davis's post-hypnotic \r\n  testimony to the jury. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, under State v. Evans, there is no \r\n  Confrontation Clause violation and the trial judge did not abuse his discretion \r\n  in allowing Davis's identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. Kendrick Davis's impeachment with prior convictions \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn direct examination, Kendrick Davis admitted \r\n  he was convicted of murder in May 1977 and was on parole for life. He was further \r\n  impeached on cross-examination with a 1968 conviction for safecracking and possession \r\n  of safecracking tools, an administrative adjudication of embezzlement while \r\n  he was in prison in 1981, and an admission that he did not pay income tax while \r\n  he worked as a barber at Kelly's.\r\n\r\nAppellant claims the trial judge erred in refusing \r\n  to allow him to further impeach Davis with 1968 convictions for grand larceny \r\n  and housebreaking, and a 1966 unlawful drug conviction. He argues this evidence \r\n  is admissible under Rule 609, SCRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 609(b) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  (b) Time Limit. Evidence of a conviction under \r\n    this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed \r\n    since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the \r\n    confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless \r\n    the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value \r\n    of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially \r\n    outweighs its prejudicial effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nWe find the evidence of these convictions was properly \r\n  excluded under Rule 609(b). First, narcotics offenses are generally not considered \r\n  probative of truthfulness, State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000), \r\n  and appellant has failed to show why the ten-year limit should be overridden \r\n  as to Davis's 1966 drug conviction. Second, the defense emphasized in closing \r\n  that it was not challenging Davis's honesty but only the accuracy of his memory. \r\n  Davis's criminal record therefore has little or no probative value and the 1968 \r\n  convictions for housebreaking and grand larceny were properly excluded under \r\n  the ten-year rule.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in \r\n  refusing to allow Davis's impeachment with these convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    4. Kendrick Davis's impeachment with racial slur \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs impeachment evidence, appellant proffered the \r\n  testimony of Kendrick Davis's co-worker, Stanley Davis, who would have testified \r\n  that Kendrick Davis stated after identifying appellant in the photo line-up: \r\n  \"Yes, I picked out the individual, but you know how it is, all these niggers \r\n  look alike.\" The trial judge ruled he would not allow the witness to use the \r\n  word \"niggers\" but permitted him to answer affirmatively defense counsel's question \r\n  whether Kendrick Davis had said \"all blacks look alike.\" Kendrick Davis was \r\n  asked during cross-examination whether he had made this statement and he denied \r\n  it. \r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge's refusal to \r\n  allow him to cross-examine Kendrick Davis with the statement using the word \r\n  \"niggers\" violated appellant's confrontation rights. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe right to meaningful cross-examination of an \r\n  adverse witness is included in the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront \r\n  his accuser. State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994); State v. Graham, \r\n  314 S.C. 383, 444 S.E.2d 525 (1994). The trial judge retains wide latitude, \r\n  however, to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination that is only marginally \r\n  relevant. State v. Aleksey, supra; State v. Smith, 315 S.C. at 552, \r\n  446 S.E.2d at 411 (quoting Delaware v. VanArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 \r\n  (1986)).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the defense emphasized in closing \r\n  argument that it was not challenging Kendrick Davis's honesty but only the accuracy \r\n  of his memory. Appellant was permitted to challenge the accuracy of Davis's \r\n  memory by impeaching him with the statement \"all blacks look alike.\" Nothing \r\n  would have been added by allowing the use of the inflammatory word \"niggers.\" \r\n  Since this evidence was irrelevant to impeach Davis's memory, there was no Confrontation \r\n  Clause violation in its exclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    5. Impeachment of defense witness Stanley Davis \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe solicitor was permitted to impeach defense \r\n  witness Stanley Davis, who testified regarding Kendrick Davis's identification, \r\n  with a prior conviction for impersonating an officer and his statement to investigators \r\n  that he knew nothing about appellant's case. Appellant claims this impeachment \r\n  evidence was improperly allowed.\r\n\r\nFirst, appellant contends that impersonating \r\n  an officer is not a crime of dishonesty and, since it is not punishable by a \r\n  term in excess of one year, it was not admissible under Rule 609, SCRE. \r\n    (2)  \r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence of a conviction of a crime involving dishonesty \r\n  is admissible for impeachment regardless of the punishment. Rule 609(a)(2), \r\n  SCRE. Federal courts applying this rule under the Federal Rules of Evidence \r\n  have held criminal impersonation is a crime involving dishonesty and therefore \r\n  admissible. United States v. Moore, 459 F.2d 1360 (D.C. Cir. 1972); Brundridge \r\n  v. City of Buffalo, 79 F.Supp.2d 219 (W.D.N.Y. 1999). We agree with the approach \r\n  taken by the federal courts and hold, since impersonating an officer involves \r\n  a misrepresentation, it is a crime involving dishonesty and therefore admissible \r\n  under Rule 609(a)(2) regardless of the punishment it carries.\r\n\r\nSecond, the solicitor sought to impeach Stanley \r\n  Davis with evidence that Davis told the solicitor's investigator he knew nothing \r\n  about the case. When asked on cross-examination, Davis simply replied that he \r\n  did not recall making such a statement. On appeal, appellant mischaracterizes \r\n  this cross-examination by stating the solicitor was allowed to impeach Davis \r\n  with his \"failure to recall an event.\" Davis's failure to recall was never made \r\n  an issue.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in \r\n  allowing this cross-examination of Stanley Davis. See State v. Aleksey, \r\n  supra (scope of cross-examination within trial judge's discretion).\r\n\r\n\r\n    6. Admission of cab driver murder \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Williams of the Richland County Sheriff's \r\n  Office testified that between 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. on February 19, 1996, he \r\n  arrived at the scene of a shooting and found the victim, Elvis McDonald, standing \r\n  next to his cab. McDonald said he had been shot by a light-skinned, black male \r\n  about 5'8\" and 130 pounds. Shortly thereafter, McDonald died of his wounds. \r\n  SLED subsequently matched the bullets from this crime to those recovered from \r\n  the barbershop crime scene. Evidence of McDonald's murder was admitted as evidence \r\n  of motive, common scheme or plan, and identity. (3) \r\n  Appellant contends this was error on several grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n    a. Clear and convincing proof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends there is not clear and convincing \r\n  evidence he committed the cab driver murder. See State v. Beck, 342 \r\n  S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000) (bad act must be proved by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence to be admissible). As we recently stated, the trial judge's ruling \r\n  admitting bad act evidence will be upheld on appeal if it is supported by any \r\n  evidence. State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001). This Court does \r\n  not conduct a de novo review to determine if the evidence is clear \r\n  and convincing. Id.\r\n\r\nHere, there is evidence appellant was in possession \r\n  of the murder weapon at the time of the cab driver shooting and the cab driver \r\n  gave a description generally matching appellant. Further, in his letter, appellant \r\n  told inmate Virgil Howard about his \"licks\" involving a cab \"down by the mall \r\n  last month\" (i.e. February) and sending someone \"to the essence.\" McDonald \r\n  was the only cab driver murdered between January and March of 1996. This evidence \r\n  is sufficient to uphold the trial judge's ruling.\r\n\r\nb. Insufficient similarity between \r\n  barbershop and cab driver killings\r\n\r\nAppellant claims there is insufficient similarity \r\n  between the barbershop shootings and the McDonald shooting because they happened \r\n  in different settings and the number of victims was different. We disagree.\r\n\r\nA close degree of similarity or connection between \r\n  the prior bad act and the crime for which the defendant is on trial is required \r\n  to support admissibility under the common scheme or plan exception. State v. \r\n  Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 504 S.E.2d 324 (1998); State v. Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 433 \r\n  S.E.2d 831 (1993). In this case, there is forensic evidence that the same gun \r\n  was used in both the barbershop and cab driver shootings. This fact establishes \r\n  a substantial connection between the two crimes that supports the admission \r\n  of evidence regarding the cab driver murder.\r\n\r\nFurther, where the defendant's own actions link \r\n  two crimes together, evidence of one crime is admissible as proof of the other \r\n  under the common scheme or plan exception. State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d \r\n  364 (1990). Here, appellant himself linked the barbershop and cab driver murders \r\n  in his letters to Virgil Howard.\r\n\r\n\r\n    c. Evidence of motive or identity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends evidence of the cab driver murder \r\n  was improperly admitted to show identity and motive. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the same weapon was used in both \r\n  the barbershop and cab driver murders goes to show appellant's identity as the \r\n  barbershop killer. Further, both crimes involved robbery, a motive matching \r\n  appellant's expressed need for money. See State v. Bell, supra \r\n  (evidence of motive is admissible as relevant and need not be necessary to the \r\n  State's case). Accordingly, evidence of the cab driver murder establishes identity \r\n  and motive.\r\n\r\n\r\n    d. Unfair prejudice \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant complains the probative value of the \r\n  evidence of the cab driver murder is outweighed by its unfair prejudice because \r\n  a layperson would not recognize the \"legal\" differences between the two crimes \r\n  and circumstantial evidence would lead the jury to conclude appellant committed \r\n  both. See State v. Beck, supra (trial judge must exclude evidence \r\n  if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice); \r\n  Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n\r\nWe find the probative value of the evidence regarding \r\n  the cab driver murder was great. In light of the evidence both crimes were committed \r\n  with the same gun, the evidence appellant committed the cab driver murder makes \r\n  it more likely he committed the barbershop murders. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial \r\n  if it has an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, such \r\n  as an emotional one. State v. Wilson, supra; State v. Alexander, 303 \r\n  S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991). There is no such improper basis suggested by \r\n  this evidence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the trial judge did not err in admitting \r\n  evidence of the cab driver murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n    7. Admissibility of letters to Virgil Howard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver appellant's objection, the trial judge admitted \r\n  appellant's letters to Virgil Howard ruling they were probative on the issues \r\n  of identity and motive and their probative value outweighed any unfair prejudicial \r\n  effect. Appellant contends this was error.\r\n\r\nUnder Rule 401, SCRE, evidence is relevant if it \r\n  has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable \r\n  the matter in controversy. The first letter makes more probable appellant's \r\n  identity as the barbershop murderer since the cab driver murder to which the \r\n  letter refers was committed with the same gun. This letter also goes to show \r\n  motive in its reference to appellant's need for money. The second letter refers \r\n  to appellant's robbery of a place with a safe, a detail that fits the barbershop \r\n  crime and makes more probable appellant's identity as the perpetrator. This \r\n  letter also goes to the issue of motive. \r\n\r\nAppellant complains the reference to the safe is \r\n  unfairly prejudicial because there is no evidence establishing that the safe \r\n  referred to is the one located in the barbershop. This second letter, although \r\n  undated, refers to the Soul Train Music Awards which the prosecution established \r\n  occurred on March 29, 1996. Accordingly, the safe incident referred to in appellant's \r\n  letter must have occurred sometime between February 2, when he was released \r\n  from jail, and the end of March 1996, putting it within the time frame of the \r\n  barbershop killings. \r\n\r\n We find these letters relevant to establish appellant's \r\n  motive and identity as the barbershop killer. Further, despite their violent \r\n  and boastful tone, the probative value of these letters outweighs any unfair \r\n  prejudice in light of the details matching both crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    8. Excluded evidence explaining reference to a \r\n    safe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant proffered testimony by an investigator \r\n  with the Richland County Public Defender's office who, after speaking with appellant \r\n  several days before trial, investigated a reported break-in at Andrews Travel \r\n  Agency that occurred in February 1996. Appellant also proffered the testimony \r\n  of the travel agent who stated that his office was broken into on the night \r\n  of February 5th and his safe was moved but not broken into. Some \r\n  stamps and petty cash were stolen. Appellant never proffered any declaration \r\n  that he actually committed the travel agency break-in.\r\n\r\nAppellant argued the evidence regarding the travel \r\n  agency was relevant to explain the reference to the safe in his letter to Virgil \r\n  Howard, thereby contradicting his connection to the barbershop murders. The \r\n  State objected on hearsay grounds and the trial judge refused to allow the admission \r\n  of this evidence. \r\n  \r\n  Without appellant's admission that he committed the travel agency break-in, \r\n  (4) evidence regarding this unrelated crime, which may or may not \r\n  have been committed by appellant, is irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. \r\n  We find no error in its exclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    9. Admission of \"Ruckus\" lyrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile appellant was incarcerated awaiting trial, \r\n  prison officials seized from his cell a rap song entitled \"The Ruckus.\" Appellant \r\n  stipulated he is the author. The lyrics read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Ruckus, Part I \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ruckus, I believe you're a perpetrator, gold and \r\n    platinum hater, cause me and J.D. is a force like Dark Vador. Who do you despise \r\n    a strong enterprise? Do the greed in your eyes lead you to tell lies? Victimize \r\n    me and Jermain Dupri, don't let me see or else there'll be death in this industry. \r\n    Want let go, set it fo' sho', I get hype like Mike put yo' blood on the dance \r\n    flo'. Blow fo' blow, toe to toe, with that no mo'. Like the 4th \r\n    of July, I spray fire in the sky. If I hear your voice, better run like horses \r\n    or like metamorphis, turn all y'all to corpses. No fingerprints or evidence \r\n    at your residence. Fools leave clues, all I leave is a blood pool. Ten murder \r\n    cases, why the sad faces? Cause when I skipped town, I left a trail [of] bodies \r\n    on the ground. Your whole click ain't nothing but tricks, bitch pulling sticks, \r\n    grown men sucking dicks. No one bring ruckus like King Justice, but toughest \r\n    the So So Def most corruptest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defense objected to the admission of this document \r\n  as improper character evidence. After the trial judge ruled it admissible, appellant \r\n  put up evidence that violent lyrics are common to rap music and suggested an \r\n  innocuous explanation of the words having to do with appellant's role in the \r\n  music industry. Further, appellant introduced the lyrics to two other songs \r\n  he had written entitled \"I Love My Babies\" and \"Mama, Mama\" about family-related \r\n  matters. \r\n\r\nAppellant contends he was unfairly prejudiced by \r\n  the admission of the Ruckus document. While we agree this evidence should not \r\n  have been admitted, we find no reversible error.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge admitted these lyrics as an admission \r\n  against interest under Rule 801(d)(2), SCRE, based on the song's reference to \r\n  leaving no prints and bodies left in a pool of blood. We find these references \r\n  too vague in context to support the admission of this evidence. The minimal \r\n  probative value of this document is far outweighed by its unfair prejudicial \r\n  impact as evidence of appellant's bad character, i.e. his propensity \r\n  for violence in general. Unlike the letters to Virgil Howard which contain identifying \r\n  details of the crimes committed, these lyrics contain only general references \r\n  glorifying violence. Accordingly, the Ruckus song should have been excluded. \r\n  See Rule 403, SCRE (although relevant, evidence may be excluded if \r\n  its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice).\r\n\r\nWhere there is other properly admitted evidence \r\n  of conduct demonstrating the particular character trait in question, however, \r\n  there is no reversible error. State v. Brown, 344 S.C. 70, 543 S.E.2d 552 (2001). \r\n  The two letters to Virgil Howard, which have the same tone, were properly admitted \r\n  and demonstrate appellant's violent disposition. We find any error in the admission \r\n  of the Ruckus document harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\n    10. Exclusion of letter denying cab driver murder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Ruckus song was seized from \r\n  appellant's cell, a letter he wrote was also seized. The letter as proffered \r\n  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yes, they do have a letter that I write in mathematics \r\n    to a fraud not God admitting to doing the cab driver. But word is bond to \r\n    the Father Allah, I didn't do the crime nor was I at any of the crime scenes. \r\n    You see, when I was pulling a lid in '94, I was on lockup for my last two \r\n    years before making my sentence of six years. This brother used to look out \r\n    for me with food, radio and writing material. We got tight like cousins within \r\n    them two years. So when I got out, I wanted to look out for him. But things \r\n    were rough out there on my own. I didn't want to lose his trust in me. So \r\n    when that cab shit came up and I read they didn't know who did it, I lied \r\n    to him so he would think I was trying to come up. See, we used to talk about \r\n    how we were going to do capers and shit, but I saw things different when I \r\n    was in the county jail. I saw brothers getting out and coming right back, \r\n    so I decided I was going to get two jobs and work on my music career. I used \r\n    to tell the officers to tell him I would look out when I got straight, but \r\n    I felt I was - he was giving up on me, so I used the cab thing to keep his \r\n    trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge excluded this letter as self-serving \r\n  hearsay. Appellant argues it was admissible under Rule 106, SCRE, to explain \r\n  the Ruckus song. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 106 provides:\r\n\r\n  When a writing, or recorded statement, or part \r\n    thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction \r\n    at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement \r\n    which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence that is otherwise inadmissible is not \r\n  admissible under Rule 106. State v. Gay, 343 S.C. 543, 541 S.E.2d 541 (2001). \r\n  Appellant's exculpatory letter contains inadmissible hearsay since it is offered \r\n  for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e. that appellant did not commit \r\n  the cab driver murder which linked him to the barbershop murders. See \r\n  Rules 801(c) and 802, SCRE. Further, it falls under no exception to the hearsay \r\n  rule. Moreover, given that it was written while appellant was awaiting trial \r\n  on this matter, its trustworthiness is highly suspect.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in \r\n  excluding this letter. See State v. Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  813 (2001) (trial judge's decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed \r\n  on appeal under abuse of discretion standard).\r\n\r\n\r\n    11. Cross-examination of Sgt. Wilkerson regarding \r\n    other suspects \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends his Sixth Amendment rights were \r\n  violated by the trial judge's refusal to allow him to cross-examine Sgt. Wilkerson \r\n  of the Columbia Police Department regarding other suspects who falsely confessed \r\n  to these murders. At trial, appellant argued this evidence was \"probative to \r\n  show the jury that some people boast or puff about crimes they did not do.\" \r\n  He claimed this evidence would explain his admission to the crimes in his letters \r\n  to Virgil Howard.\r\n\r\n The right to meaningful cross-examination of an \r\n  adverse witness is included in the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront \r\n  his accuser. State v. Smith, supra; State v. Graham, supra. \r\n  Trial judges retain wide latitude, however, to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination \r\n  including questions regarding matters that are only marginally relevant. State \r\n  v. Aleksey, supra; State v. Smith, 315 S.C. at 552, 446 S.E.2d at 411 \r\n  (quoting Delaware v. VanArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986)). The fact \r\n  that other people may confess to crimes they did not commit has little or no \r\n  relevance to appellant's guilt in this case.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in \r\n  refusing to allow this line of questioning. \r\n  \r\n\r\n    12. Failure to disclose information regarding \r\n    Bernard Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBernard Johnson gave Columbia police a statement \r\n  indicating that he was the owner of the .38, that he gave the gun to appellant, \r\n  and that appellant said he used the gun in the barbershop shootings. At the \r\n  time he was interviewed by police, Johnson was in jail on unrelated drug charges. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAt trial, the defense requested that the State \r\n  be required to disclose the identity of the confidential informant who led police \r\n  to arrest Johnson on these drug charges and the audio tapes of Johnson's drug \r\n  transactions claiming, \"[W]e need to know all the relevant evidence about any \r\n  testifying snitch in this case.\" Appellant contends the trial judge's refusal \r\n  to require disclosure of this information violated his due process rights, especially \r\n  in light of the fact that Johnson eventually pled guilty to the pending drug \r\n  charges and received an eight-year sentence.\r\n\r\nDue process requires the prosecution to disclose \r\n  evidence that is favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment. \r\n  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985); Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 \r\n  (1963). Evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, \r\n  had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been \r\n  different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine \r\n  confidence in the outcome. State v. Cain, 297 S.C. 497, 503, 377 S.E.2d 556, \r\n  559 (1988) (quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682). In determining \r\n  the materiality of nondisclosed evidence, the reviewing court's function is \r\n  to determine whether the appellant's right to a fair trial has been impaired. \r\n  Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995); State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  870 (1998).\r\n\r\nWe find the nondisclosure of the requested information \r\n  did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. Narcotics offenses are generally \r\n  not considered probative of truthfulness. State v. Aleksey, supra. \r\n  Accordingly, the requested drug-related information regarding Johnson would \r\n  have little, if any, impeachment value. Further, appellant does not argue he \r\n  was deprived of information regarding any deal Johnson may have had with prosecutors. \r\n  (5)\r\n\r\nIn any event, Johnson was thoroughly impeached \r\n  with nine drug charges pending from August 1996 for which he was released on \r\n  bond in exchange for his testimony in this case, five additional drug charges \r\n  pending from October 1996, and prior convictions for possession of an unlawful \r\n  weapon, assault and battery with intent to kill, and possession and distribution \r\n  of crack cocaine. Where there is an abundance of evidence detailing the witness's \r\n  unabashed disrespect for the law, the nondisclosure of other impeaching evidence \r\n  does not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, \r\n  137, 437 S.E.2d 75, 82 (1993). This issue is without merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant's remaining issues are without merit \r\n  and we dispose of them pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR. See Issue 6: \r\n  Johnson v.

Johnson's statement also \r\n  indicates appellant told him he killed the cab driver but Johnson denied this \r\n  at trial. \r\n2. Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-720 \r\n  (1985), impersonating a law enforcement officer is punishable by a term of not \r\n  more than one year. \r\n3. Evidence of other crimes \r\n  or bad acts, although generally inadmissible to prove the defendant's bad character, \r\n  is admissible when it tends to establish motive, identity, a common scheme or \r\n  plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent. Rule 404(b), SCRE; see \r\n  also State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923). \r\n4. Initially, it appears such \r\n  an admission (through the investigator) would be permitted as an exception to \r\n  the hearsay rule under Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, which allows for the admission \r\n  of a statement against the declarant's penal interest. This exception applies, \r\n  however, only if the declarant is unavailable. Rule 804(b), SCRE.

Clare, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W.

Leadbitter, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: We granted a writ of certiorari to review the denial of Post-Conviction Relief (PCR) to Petitioner,\r\nJames P. Hughes (Hughes).  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nHughes was indicted for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), possession of a weapon during a violent crime, and\r\npointing a firearm in connection with events which occurred in Kingstree on September 1, 1994. (1)  Both the ABIK victim,\r\nMarone Nesmith (Nesmith), and Hughes' co-defendant, Larone Shaw (Shaw)(the pointing a firearm victim), testified\r\nHughes walked up to Shaw, held a gun to his throat, and threatened to kill Shaw if he didn't pay Hughes money he owed. \r\nNesmith, witnessing the events, crossed the street to avoid the confrontation.  As Hughes began walking away from Shaw,\r\nShaw pulled a gun and shot at Hughes; the bullet missed Hughes and hit Nesmith, permanently paralyzing him.\r\n\r\nShaw and Hughes were jointly tried on April 4-5, 1995. (2)  At the close of the state's case, the state nol prossed the charges\r\nof ABIK and possession of a weapon during a violent crime against Hughes, leaving Hughes to be tried solely on the\r\ncharge of pointing a firearm, with Shaw remaining as his co-defendant.  The trial judge indicated that  since the cases had\r\nalready been tried together to that point, he saw no reason to sever.   The jury convicted Hughes of pointing a firearm, and\r\nhe was sentenced to five years. (3)    \r\n\r\nHughes sought PCR, alleging counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate the evidence against him (on the charges of\r\nABIK and possession of a weapon during a violent crime), and failing to move to sever his trial from Shaw's.  The PCR\r\ncourt denied relief.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in ruling counsel was not ineffective in failing to move for a severance?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To establish a claim of ineffective assistance \r\n  of trial counsel, a PCR applicant has the burden of proving counsel's representation \r\n  fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and, but for counsel's errors, \r\n  there is a reasonable probability that the result at trial would have been different. \r\n  . . . A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence \r\n  in the outcome of the trial.\" Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  733, 735 (1997) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, \r\n  80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). Thus, a PCR applicant must show both error and prejudice \r\n  to win relief. Scott v. State, 334 S.C. 248, 513 S.E.2d 100 (1999). The burden \r\n  is on the PCR applicant to prove the allegations in his application. Butler \r\n  v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985). An appellate court must affirm \r\n  the PCR court's decision when its findings are supported by any evidence of \r\n  probative value. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). \r\n\r\n\r\nCriminal defendants who are jointly tried are not \r\n  entitled to separate trials as a matter of right. State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. \r\n  275, 281, 523 S.E.2d 173, 176 (1999). A defendant who alleges he was improperly \r\n  tried jointly must show prejudice before this Court will reverse his conviction. \r\n  Id. The general rule allowing joint trials applies with equal force when a defendant's \r\n  severance motion is based upon the likelihood he and a co-defendant will present \r\n  mutually antagonistic defenses, i.e., accuse one another of committing the crime. \r\n  Id. \r\n\r\nA severance should be granted only when there is \r\n  a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial \r\n  right of a co-defendant or prevent the jury from making a reliable \r\n  judgment about a co-defendant's guilt. Id. (Emphasis supplied). A proper cautionary \r\n  instruction may help protect the individual rights of each defendant and ensure \r\n  that no prejudice results from a joint trial. State v. Holland, 261 S.C. 488, \r\n  494, 201 S.E.2d 118, 121(1973). An appellate court should not reverse a conviction \r\n  achieved at a joint trial in the absence of a reasonable probability that the \r\n  defendant would have obtained a more favorable result at a separate trial. People \r\n  v. Greenberger, 68 Cal.Rptr.2d 61, 86 (Cal. App. 1997).\r\n\r\nHere, the thrust of Hughes' argument is that he should not have been tried with his co-defendant Shaw because evidence\r\nconcerning the ABIK and possession of a weapon during a violent crime was irrelevant to the sole crime with which he was\r\ncharged, i.e. pointing a firearm.  Hughes asserts he would have been found not guilty of pointing a firearm if the trials had\r\nbeen severed.  We disagree.  There is simply not a reasonable probability that, had the charges been severed, the jury would\r\nhave found Hughes not guilty of pointing a firearm. (4)\r\n\r\nAs noted previously, the charges of ABIK and possession of a weapon during a violent crime were nol prossed by the\r\nsolicitor at the close of the state's case.  At this point, the court instructed the jury that those counts no longer existed with\r\nregard to Hughes. (5)  Both the victim and Shaw testified Hughes walked up to Shaw, held a gun to his throat and threatened\r\nto kill Shaw if he didn't give him money.  Further, both Shaw and Nesmith testified Shaw was the only shooter.  Hughes\r\ndid not testify and the sole witness he presented was a cab driver who testified he'd given Hughes a ride to Thorne Avenue,\r\nwhere the incident occurred, and picked him up again about 10 minutes later, but that he did not see Hughes carrying a\r\npistol either time.  The cabdriver testified that when he picked him up the second time, Hughes was acting strange.  He took\r\nHughes to the back of the courthouse where Hughes' car was parked.   In closing argument, Hughes' sole defense was that\r\nShaw had simply invented a \"self-defense\" story in an attempt to exculpate himself of liability for shooting\r\nNesmith.\r\n\r\nWe ascertain no evidence presented at the joint \r\n  trial which would not have been presented at an independent trial of Hughes. \r\n  Given that the only two eyewitnesses testified Hughes walked up, pointed a gun \r\n  at Shaw's throat, and threatened to kill him, it is patent this evidence would \r\n  have come out at an independent trial. Therefore, the only evidence of which \r\n  Hughes really complains is evidence that Shaw shot at Hughes, missing him and \r\n  accidentally hitting Nesmith (i.e., the ABIK). However, as both Shaw and Nesmith \r\n  testified Hughes was in no way involved in the ABIK, we fail to see how this \r\n  evidence was in any way prejudicial to Hughes. Moreover, since Hughes' sole \r\n  defense to the charge of pointing a firearm was that it was a fabrication by \r\n  Shaw to exculpate himself of liability for the ABIK, it is likewise patent evidence \r\n  of the ABIK would have been presented at a separate trial. \r\n  (6) Accordingly, Hughes has not demonstrated in what way he was prejudiced \r\n  by the joint trial, nor has he shown a reasonable probability that the outcome \r\n  would have been different had he been separately tried. Finally, Hughes has \r\n  failed to demonstrate any specific trial right which was compromised, or that \r\n  the joint trial somehow prevented the jury from making a reliable determination \r\n  of his guilt. Dennis, supra.\r\n\r\nWe have consistently held that an applicant seeking \r\n  relief on PCR must demonstrate not only error, but also prejudice. See Humbert \r\n  v. State, Op. No. 25314 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 25, 2001)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. \r\n  No. 23 at 64) (Court will not presume prejudice where defendant was tried wearing \r\n  prison garb and shackles); Brown v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533 S.E.2d 308 (2000) \r\n  (defendant who was not advised of right not to testify must demonstrate prejudice \r\n  on PCR); Davis v. State, 326 S.C. 283, 486 S.E.2d 747 (1997) (declining to presume \r\n  prejudice where trial counsel did not conduct an investigation of the charges \r\n  against his client and admitted he was unprepared for trial). We adhere to this \r\n  precedent and decline to presume prejudice under the limited facts of this case.\r\n\r\nWe do not, by our opinion, imply that a defendant jointly tried with a co-defendant/victim would never be entitled to PCR. \r\nOn the contrary, if a defendant is able to demonstrate prejudice from such a joint trial, (7) PCR would be warranted. \r\nHowever, this is simply not the situation in the present case and Hughes has demonstrated no prejudice resultant from the\r\njoint trial with Shaw.\r\n\r\nThe ruling of the PCR judge is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.  MOORE, J., dissenting in a separate\r\nopinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES (concurring separately):  I agree with the result reached by the majority.  I write separately to\r\nexpress my concern about the potential for abuse in the joint prosecution of defendants similarly situated to these.\r\n\r\nThe absence of evidence that Hughes committed Assault and Battery with Intent to Kill (ABIK) (8) supports an inference that\r\nthe prosecution's decision to try Hughes and Shaw jointly was a stratagem used only to prejudice Hughes by presenting\r\nevidence of Nesmith's injuries before the jury.  Such evidence was irrelevant to the issue of Hughes's guilt on the pointing\r\nand presenting a firearm charge, and would not have been admitted had Hughes been tried separately on that charge.  I\r\nwould strongly discourage the employment of such ploys by the prosecution.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above, Hughes has failed to meet his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the outcome of\r\nthe proceeding would have been different had separate trials been conducted, and therefore, is not entitled to post-conviction relief. (9)\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE (dissenting):  I respectfully dissent from the majority's opinion.\r\nUnder the particular facts of this\r\ncase, the act of trying Hughes with Shaw, who was the victim of Hughes's crime of pointing a firearm, as his co-defendant\r\nwas inherently prejudicial.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true criminal defendants who are jointly \r\n  tried are not entitled to separate trials as a matter of right, \r\n  (10) a criminal defendant is entitled to a trial free from bias and \r\n  confusion. As the majority states, a severance should be granted only when there \r\n  is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right \r\n  of a co-defendant or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about \r\n  a co-defendant's guilt. State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999) \r\n  (emphasis added). Allowing Hughes to be tried with his victim as his co-defendant \r\n  seriously hampered the jury's ability to make a reliable judgment about Hughes's \r\n  guilt for the charge of pointing a firearm. Accordingly, I would hold the PCR \r\n  court erred by finding counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate \r\n  the charges against Hughes and for failing to make a motion to sever Hughes's \r\n  trial from his victim/co-defendant's trial.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n1.   Although Hughes was initially indicted only for pointing a firearm, the indictment was amended before the grand jury\r\nwhen \"evidence came forward, both [he and his co-defendant] were shooting.\"\r\n2.   Shaw was indicted for ABIK and possession of a weapon during a violent crime.  \r\n3.   Shaw was convicted of ABIK and possession of a weapon during commission of a violent crime and sentenced to 15\r\nyears, and five years, respectively.\r\n4.   We assume, arguendo, counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in failing to move for\r\na severance since, had he learned that neither Shaw nor Nesmith would inculpate Hughes of the ABIK charges, a severance\r\ncould likely have been obtained prior to trial.  The issue remains, however, whether Hughes was in any way prejudiced by\r\nthe lack of a severance.\r\n5.   In its final charge, the court reiterated that Shaw was charged with ABIK and possession of a weapon during a violent\r\ncrime, and Hughes was charged with pointing a firearm.  The court also advised that each of the cases was to be considered\r\nseparately and distinctly, and thoroughly went over the verdict forms applicable to each defendant. \r\n6.   Hughes makes no claim that an alternate defense would have been presented at an independent trial.\r\n7.   If, for example, Shaw had given a statement inculpating Hughes and then refused to testify, there could have been\r\nConfrontation Clause problems with a joint trial.  Since, however, Shaw testified and was subject to cross-examination, no\r\nsuch right was compromised in this case.  \r\n8. Whether this was apparent to the prosecution prior to trial or whether it only became apparent at the close of the state's\r\ncase is unclear.  Given the total lack of evidence of ABIK against Hughes, the circumstances are strongly suspect. \r\n9. I am less convinced that trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to request that the charges against Hughes be severed\r\nand separate trials had on the ABIK and pointing and presenting a firearm charges.  Since that issue is not before the Court,\r\nit need not be addressed. \r\n10. State v.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct\r\nand consents to an indefinite suspension or disbarment from the practice of law in this state.  We accept the agreement and\r\ndisbar respondent, retroactive to the date respondent was placed on interim suspension. (1)  The facts as admitted in the\r\nagreement are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nI.  Family Court Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent was involved in marital litigation with his wife.  He was held in contempt by the family court, which could be\r\npurged by bringing current the mortgage on the marital home.  Respondent issued checks to the mortgage company from a\r\nclosed account.  The family court found that respondent knew the account was closed when he wrote the checks, and again\r\nheld him in contempt.\r\n\r\nII.  Client A Matter\r\n\r\nClient A hired respondent to represent her after she was involved in an automobile accident.  Respondent settled the claim\r\nand issued a check to Client A from a bank account that was not a trust account.  Respondent has not operated a trust\r\naccount since early 1999.  The check was returned to Client A for insufficient funds.  Respondent paid Client A's claim\r\nusing cash and a cashier's check.  Respondent's checks to Client A's medical providers were also returned for insufficient\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nIII.  Client B Matter\r\n\r\nClient B retained respondent to represent her in a foreclosure action.  Respondent received checks totaling $61,460 from\r\nthe insurance company.  He instructed Client B to endorse the checks and return them to respondent.  Respondent told\r\nClient B that the money was going to be held in an escrow account.  Respondent did not have a trust or escrow account at\r\nthat time.  He gave Client B a check for $3,000 from his personal account.  Respondent misappropriated the remainder of\r\nClient B's funds.\r\n\r\nIV.  Settlement of Client C's Estate\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained to settle Client C's estate.  Respondent made disbursements to three beneficiaries of the estate. \r\nNone of the checks were issued from a trust account.  Two of the checks were returned for insufficient funds.  On learning\r\nof this, the third beneficiary did not attempt to negotiate her check.  \r\n\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel issued a subpoena for respondent's bank records and files from Client C's estate.  The\r\nclient file was not delivered at the date and time promised, and respondent did not turn over all of the requested bank\r\nrecords.  A review of respondent's bank records indicate at least 69 negative balances, 40 overdraft fees, and 42 NSF fees\r\nover a course of ten months.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Proposal for Distribution\" filed with the probate court, respondent stated that various distributions had been made\r\nfrom Client C's estate.  In particular, respondent represented to the probate court that he had made payments to the State of\r\nMichigan and to Bankers Life and Casualty of Chicago.  Neither of these parties received disbursements from Client C's\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nAfter respondent issued checks to the beneficiaries of Client C's estate that were returned for insufficient funds, the Aiken\r\nCounty Department of Public Safety began an investigation.  Respondent was subsequently arrested for breach of trust with\r\nfraudulent intent.\r\n\r\nV.   Contempt of South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n\r\nPursuant to an investigation under Rule 413, SCACR, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel issued a subpoena for\r\nrespondent's client files and bank records.  Respondent failed to comply with the subpoena, and was found to be in civil\r\ncontempt by this Court on March 26, 2001.  \r\n\r\nVI.  Failure to Cooperate with Attorney to Protect\r\n\r\nAfter respondent was placed on interim suspension, Todd J.  Johnson was appointed as the attorney to protect clients'\r\ninterests pursuant to Rule 413, SCACR.  Respondent failed to turn over client files to Johnson.  After repeated requests\r\nfrom both Johnson and respondent's clients, many of these files still have not been turned over to Johnson.  The failure to\r\ncooperate with Johnson was cited as one of the reasons that respondent was held in contempt by this Court.\r\n\r\nVII.  Failure to Cooperate with Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel sent a Notice to Appear to respondent.  He was directed to appear and bring all records\r\nregarding his family court matter, Client A, Client B, and the settlement of Client C's estate.  Respondent neither attended\r\nthe Notice to Appear nor did he provide the subpoenaed documents for that appearance. \r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: \r\nRule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence\r\nand promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a\r\nmatter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent\r\nreasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer\r\nshall hold and safeguard property of clients or third persons separate from the lawyer's own business or personal property);\r\nRule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law\r\nto a third person or fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a\r\ncriminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure is prohibited); Rule 8.1 (failure to respond to a lawful demand for\r\ninformation from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b)\r\n(committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer); Rule\r\n8.4(c) (engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\r\nmisrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice). \r\n\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (willful failure to respond to a lawful\r\ndemand from a disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or\r\nto bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); Rule\r\n7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state. \r\nReinstatement shall be conditioned upon full restitution to all injured parties.  Within fifteen days of the date of this\r\nopinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413,\r\nSCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

In the agreement,\r\nrespondent admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand.  We accept the agreement.  The facts as set forth in the\r\nagreement are as follows.\r\n \r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nRespondent represented a client in a property dispute involving a home that was owned jointly by the client and the client's\r\nex-girlfriend.  The ex-girlfriend entered into a relationship with a St. George police officer who was involved in a pending\r\ndivorce and child custody matter.  After learning that the officer and the ex-girlfriend had rendezvoused on the property at\r\nthe center of the dispute between the client and the ex-girlfriend, respondent sent a letter warning the officer not to enter\r\nthat property.  The letter stated that the officer's \"failure to abide by this no trespass notice will result in the immediate\r\nprocurement of a warrant for your arrest for trespass after notice.\"  The letter also suggested that the officer threatened\r\nphysical harm to the client.  Respondent sent copies of this letter to the St. George, Seneca, and Clemson University Police\r\nDepartments, as well as the attorneys and the guardian ad litem in the divorce matter. \r\n\r\nLaw\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that his conduct violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 3.1\r\n(asserting a frivolous claim or contention); Rule 4.1 (making a false statement of material fact or law to a third person);\r\nRule 4.4 (using means that have no purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden); Rule 4.5 (threatening to present\r\ncriminal charges solely to obtain an advantage in a civil matter); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct);\r\nand Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits that he violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:\r\nRule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the\r\nadministration of justice or tending to bring the legal profession into disrepute); and Rule 7(a)(6 ) (violating the oath of\r\noffice taken upon admission to practice law in South Carolina).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe find that respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand.  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\nby Consent and hereby reprimand respondent.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25352","title":"In the Matter of George Turner Perrow","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25352","description":"Opinion suspending attorney indefinitely","date":"2001-08-27","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n\r\nIn the Matter of George Turner Perrow,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25352\r\nSubmitted July 10, 2001 - Filed August 27, 2001\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\nG. Wells Dickson, Jr. and Lionel S. Lofton, of Lionel S. Lofton Law Offices, both of Charleston, for respondent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement\r\npursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite\r\nsuspension of no more than two years or an indefinite suspension.  We accept the agreement and find an indefinite\r\nsuspension, retroactive to the date respondent was placed on interim suspension, is appropriate under the circumstances. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Facts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts as stated in the agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\nI.  Estate Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent was named personal representative of an estate.  As personal representative, he had signatory authority on the\r\nestate's checking account.  Respondent computed his statutory commission for serving as personal representative to be\r\n$5,000 and issued a check payable to himself in that amount dated January 31, 2000.  However, when he entered the check\r\nin the estate's check register, he indicated it was written to a beneficiary of the estate in the amount of $500.\r\n\r\nAs personal representative, respondent also undertook to be the unofficial guardian of the aforementioned beneficiary. \r\nRather than make a lump sum disbursement to the beneficiary for a bequest made to him by the deceased, respondent\r\nregularly wrote checks to the beneficiary on the estate's account.  On or about June 16, 2000, respondent withdrew\r\n$4,113.79 from the estate's bank account, the remaining balance in the account, and retained the funds for his personal use. \r\nRespondent maintained the funds were to pay the statutory commission he was due as personal representative of the estate\r\nand that he had forgotten he had previously paid himself that commission.  Following inquiries from the Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel, respondent reimbursed the estate the sum of $4,113.79 and corrected the entries on the estate's check\r\nregister.\r\n\r\nRespondent also issued a check on the estate's account to himself in the amount of $1,303 for legal services he provided to\r\nthe estate.  Respondent acknowledges that, in retrospect, it was improper for him, in his capacity as personal representative,\r\nto engage himself to do legal work for the estate for fees over and above the statutory commission he was due for serving as\r\npersonal representative.  Finally, Disciplinary Counsel contends, and respondent agrees, that when respondent undertook to\r\nprovide legal services to the estate, it became incumbent upon him to maintain the funds of the estate in accordance with\r\nthe requirements of Rule 417, SCACR, which respondent acknowledges he failed to do.\r\n\r\nII. Personal Injury/Child \r\n  Support Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent represented a client in a personal injury matter and a child support matter.  The written fee agreement in the\r\npersonal injury matter provided for a one-third contingency fee.  When the personal injury matter was settled for $5,500,\r\nrespondent deposited the settlement check into his general operating account, out of which respondent issued a check to the\r\nclient for $2,000 and a check to himself for $3,500.  Respondent maintains the excess of $1,666.67 over and above the one-third fee set forth in the fee agreement was additional fees due him for representation of the client in the child support\r\nmatter.  Respondent has no correspondence, bills, records, time sheets, or other documentation to support the additional\r\nfee; however his files indicate he represented the client in the child support matter.  Respondent cannot provide any written\r\ndocumentation indicating the client was aware of or approved the additional payment, and respondent failed to prepare a\r\ndisbursement sheet in connection with the disbursement of the proceeds from the settlement of the personal injury matter.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the personal injury matter, three medical providers were paid a total of $2,712.75 out of respondent's escrow\r\naccount notwithstanding the fact that no deposit had ever been made on behalf of the client into the escrow account. \r\nMoreover, when the payments were made to the medical providers, there were no funds in the escrow account due\r\nrespondent for fees and costs in those amounts.  Accordingly, funds from other clients were used to make the payments.  \r\n\r\nIII. Home Repair Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent used client funds in his escrow account to pay for repairs to his personal residence.  Respondent has since\r\nrepaid the monies.\r\n\r\nIV. Workers' Compensation \r\n  Matters\r\n\r\nRespondent represented a client in a workers' compensation matter.  Although there was no written fee agreement,\r\nrespondent was to be paid a contingency fee.  The matter was settled and the Workers' Compensation Commission\r\n(Commission) approved certain disbursements of the proceeds.  Instead of disbursing to himself the amount approved by\r\nthe Commission, respondent disbursed to himself $3,848.26 more than the amount approved by the Commission. \r\nRespondent maintains the additional amount was for legal fees respondent felt he was due in connection with other matters\r\nhe was handling for the client.  However, in addition to having no written fee agreement, respondent has no time sheets, no\r\nstatements or bills nor any correspondence to or from the client to support this representation or to indicate the client knew\r\nof or approved of the additional payment.  Respondent does have files indicating he performed substantial work for the\r\nclient on the other matters.\r\n\r\nAfter inquiries by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, respondent reimbursed the client $3,848.26.  Moreover, when the\r\nOffice of Disciplinary Counsel spoke to the client, the client indicated he had verbally approved respondent retaining the\r\nadditional fee, but he was under the impression the additional fee was to constitute full payment for the conclusion of long-term disability and social security matters respondent was handling for him.  The client indicated the matters were not fully\r\nresolved to his satisfaction by respondent and, with the assistance of his daughter, he finally resolved them himself.\r\n\r\nOn two other occasions, respondent represented the client in workers' compensation matters.  On both occasions,\r\nrespondent was to be paid a contingency fee, but there was no written fee agreement.  Both matters were settled.  In one of\r\nthe matters, fees were disbursed as approved by the Commission.  However, in the other matter, after the settlement\r\nproceeds were deposited in respondent's escrow account, respondent disbursed a portion of the funds to another client.  In\r\naddition, he disbursed fees to himself in excess of that approved by the Commission.  As a result, a portion of the\r\ndisbursements made from the escrow account to the client were made using the funds of other clients inasmuch as the\r\nproceeds of the settlement had been exhausted.  Respondent maintains he felt he was entitled to the excess fee for work he\r\nperformed for the client on additional social security and long-term disability matters.  However, there are no written fee\r\nagreements, bills, statements, ledger cards, disbursement schedules, correspondence or other documentation in respondent's\r\nrecords authorizing the excess fee.\r\n\r\nIn addition, prior to inquiries by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, the client had not received his full disbursement from\r\nthe settlement proceeds although more than a year had passed since the matter was settled.  Respondent has since used\r\npersonal funds to pay the client the remaining balance of the disbursement approved by the Commission as well as the\r\nexcess fee.\r\n\r\nV. Probate Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent undertook, on a contingency fee basis, representation of four beneficiaries in a contested probate matter. \r\nSubsequently, one of the clients was appointed personal representative of the estate.  The client then engaged respondent to\r\nrepresent him in his official capacity as personal representative.  Respondent undertook the representation despite the fact\r\nthat he had previously represented the other beneficiaries and without following procedures set forth in Rule 407, SCACR,\r\nfor dealing with such conflicts of interest.\r\n\r\nIn addition, respondent was given custody of certain funds of the estate, but failed to maintain accurate records concerning\r\nthe funds and failed to comply with the recordkeeping and accounting requirements set forth in Rule 417, SCACR.  As a\r\nresult of errors in recordkeeping, a negative balance developed in the estate funds.  A subsequent disbursement made by\r\nrespondent was therefore taken from funds belonging to other clients.  Following inquiries from the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel, respondent used personal funds to reimburse the estate as well the personal representative for monies owed.\r\n\r\nVI. Secretarial Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent acknowledges that reports that his misconduct was related to errors or shortcomings on the part of his\r\nsecretarial staff were incorrect and he accepts full and sole responsibility for the circumstances leading to his suspension.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Law\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his actions he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\r\n407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (diligent representation); Rule 1.4(a) (communication with clients); Rule 1.5 (fees); Rule 1.7\r\n(conflict of interest); Rule 1.15 (safekeeping of client funds); Rule 3.3 (candor toward tribunal); Rule 8.4(a) (violation of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and\r\nRule 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).  Respondent also violated Rule 7 of the Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, by violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, engaging in conduct tending\r\nto pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute, violating the oath of\r\noffice, and willfully violating a valid court order.  Finally, respondent failed to comply with the recordkeeping requirements\r\nof Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough respondent has reconciled his escrow account and has reimbursed all clients or transferred sufficient funds to the\r\nattorney to protect clients' interests appointed in this matter so that he may reimburse clients, we find the facts set forth in\r\nthe agreement warrant an indefinite suspension from the practice of law, retroactive to August 2, 2000, the date of\r\nrespondent's interim suspension.  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the\r\nClerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n                   TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

Suggs, of Suggs &amp; Kelly, P.A., of\r\nColumbia, and David P. Voisin, of Center for Capital Litigation, of Columbia,\r\nfor respondent/petitioner.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:\r\nThe State appeals the post conviction relief (&quot;PCR&quot;) courtâ€™s order\r\ngranting Ellis Franklin (&quot;Franklin&quot;) a new trial on his capital murder\r\ncharge. Franklin cross appeals the PCR courtâ€™s ruling that he was not entitled\r\nto a new trial on his non-murder charges. We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn January of 1993, Franklin was\r\nfound guilty of murder, burglary in the first degree, grand larceny, and\r\ncriminal sexual conduct in the first degree. In the penalty phase, the jury\r\nfound four statutory aggravating circumstances and recommended a death sentence.\r\nThe trial judge sentenced Franklin to death for murder, to ten years for grand\r\nlarceny, to thirty years for criminal sexual conduct, and to life imprisonment\r\nfor burglary. This Court affirmed these convictions on direct appeal. State\r\nv. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357 (1995). Franklinâ€™s petition for\r\nwrit of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied. Franklin v.\r\nSouth Carolina, 516 U.S. 856, 116 S. Ct. 160, 133 L. E. 2d 103 (1995).\r\nFranklin then filed for PCR on\r\nMarch 14, 1996. An evidentiary hearing was held on January 27, 1998. The\r\nevidentiary hearing was limited to the following allegations in Franklinâ€™s\r\npetition for relief:\r\n\r\n      1. Applicant did not\r\n      knowingly or intelligently waive his right to address the jury at the\r\n      conclusion of the guilt phase of his capital trial as guaranteed by S.C.\r\n      Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-28 (Supp. 2000) and the Due Process Clause of the\r\n      Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\r\n      2. Applicant was denied his\r\n      right to the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth\r\n      and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and South\r\n      Carolina law by the following acts and omissions of trial counsel:\r\n      Counsel failed to explain\r\n      to applicant that he had the right to address the jury at the conclusion\r\n      of the guilt/innocence phase. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-28.\r\n\r\nOn October 2, 1998, the PCR judge\r\nentered an order granting Franklin post conviction relief and requiring a new\r\ntrial on all the charges. The State then moved to alter or amend the judgment\r\nasserting the non-murder charges of burglary, grand larceny, and criminal sexual\r\nconduct charges should not be affected by the alleged error and should be\r\nreinstated. On February 12, 1999, the PCR judge granted the Stateâ€™s request to\r\nlimit relief to Franklinâ€™s murder conviction. Both parties appealed. This\r\nCourt granted certiorari as to the Stateâ€™s Questions I and II and Franklinâ€™s\r\nQuestion II, and the following issues are before this Court:\r\n\r\n      I. Did the PCR court err by\r\n      finding Franklin did not waive his statutory right to make a personal\r\n      closing statement in the guilt phase of his trial?\r\n      II. Assuming there was no\r\n      waiver of Franklinâ€™s statutory right to make a closing statement in the\r\n      guilt phase, did the PCR court err by granting a new trial because\r\n      Franklin did not show he was prejudiced under Strickland v.\r\n      Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 88 L. E. 2d 908 (1984) or\r\n      Rule 61, SCRCP, by the lack of waiver?\r\n      III. Did the PCR court err\r\n      by denying relief on Franklinâ€™s non-capital convictions after finding he\r\n      had not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to address the jury\r\n      during the guilt phase of his trial and after finding that counsel was\r\n      ineffective for not advising him of that right?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nI. Waiver\r\n\r\nThe State argues the PCR court\r\nerred in holding Franklin did not knowingly and intelligently waive his\r\nstatutory right under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-28 to make a personal closing\r\nstatement during the guilt phase of his capital murder trial. We disagree.\r\nOn October 2, 1998, the PCR court\r\ngranted Franklin post conviction relief on the ground he did not knowingly and\r\nintelligently waive his statutory right to make an argument in the guilt phase\r\nof his trial.1 In reviewing a grant of post conviction relief, we are\r\n&quot;concerned only with whether there is any evidence of probative value to\r\nsupport the PCR judgeâ€™s decision.&quot; Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506,\r\n512, 511 S.E.2d 62, 65 (1999); Skeen v. State, 325 S.C. 210, 481 S.E.2d\r\n129 (1997). Therefore, the PCR courtâ€™s findings should be affirmed if there is\r\n&quot;any probative evidence&quot; to support the courtâ€™s findings. Palacio,\r\nsupra.\r\n\r\nSection 16-3-28 provides:\r\n&quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any criminal trial where\r\nthe maximum penalty is death or in a separate sentencing proceeding following\r\nsuch trial, the defendant and his counsel shall have the right to make the last\r\nargument.&quot; Before the abolition of in favorem vitae review, we held\r\nin State v. Orr, 304 S.C. 185, 403 S.E.2d 623 (1991), a capital defendant\r\nwas entitled to reversal of his conviction where the trial judge failed to\r\nobtain an on-the-record waiver of the defendantâ€™s statutory right under\r\nsection 16-3-28. See also State v. Cooper, 312 S.C. 90, 439 S.E.2d 276\r\n(1994); State v. Reed, 293 S.C. 515, 362 S.E.2d 13 (1987), overruled\r\nin part by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nAfter in favorem vitae\r\nreview was abolished, we stated the appropriate forum for addressing this issue\r\nwas a post conviction relief proceeding &quot;where the facts surrounding the\r\ntrial can be fully explored.&quot; State v. Rocheville, 310 S.C. 20, 25,\r\n425 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1993); Cartrette v. State, 323 S.C. 15, 448 S.E.2d 553\r\n(1994); State v. Torrence, supra. We found &quot;[t]he post\r\nconviction relief process is specifically designed to allow for an inquiry into\r\nthe relevant facts surrounding the adequacy of a defendantâ€™s information\r\nand/or waiver of rights . . .&quot; Cartrette, 323 S.C. at 18, 448 S.E.2d\r\nat 555. Therefore, under the current law, a petitioner for post conviction\r\nrelief may no longer rely solely on the trial record to demonstrate the lack of\r\nwaiver. The PCR court should analyze all the facts surrounding the trial to\r\ndetermine if a petitioner knowingly and intelligently waived his rights under\r\nsection 16-3-28.\r\nThe trial record, PCR transcript,\r\naffidavits, and depositions support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that Franklin did\r\nnot knowingly and intelligently waive his right. There was no on-the-record\r\nwaiver of Franklinâ€™s statutory right to personally address the jury at the end\r\nof the guilt phase. At the conclusion of the guilt phase, the trial court merely\r\nstated the order of closing arguments, but did not mention a defendantâ€™s right\r\nto address the jury. After reviewing the record, we cannot find any reference to\r\nFranklinâ€™s rights under section 16-3-28 until the penalty phase of the trial.2\r\nTestimony at the PCR hearing\r\nfurther supports Franklinâ€™s argument that no waiver occurred. Two defense\r\nattorneys represented Franklin in his initial trial. Although it was not their\r\nfirst murder trial, it was the first capital case tried by either attorney. One\r\nof Franklinâ€™s attorneys testified he did not know at the time of trial a\r\ndefendant had the right to make a closing argument in the guilt phase and did\r\nnot advise Franklin he had such a right. He stated if he had known of the right,\r\nhe &quot;would have advised [Franklin] that was his right and certainly would\r\nhave left it up to him to make a decision regarding what he wished to do.&quot;\r\nCo-counsel testified similarly. He stated at the time of the trial he was not\r\naware of the guilt phase statutory right. He further stated he personally did\r\nnot advise Franklin of this right, and, to his knowledge, his co-counsel had not\r\neither. Former solicitor Wade Kolb, the prosecutor in Franklinâ€™s case, also\r\ntestified at the PCR hearing. He stated he did not specifically hear the trial\r\ncourt discuss a defendantâ€™s rights under section 16-3-28 with either defense\r\ncounsel or Franklin. Finally, Franklin testified before the PCR judge. He stated\r\nneither of his counsel ever informed him of a statutory right to make a closing\r\nargument in the guilt phase.\r\nTherefore, there is ample\r\nprobative evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that Franklin did not\r\nwaive his right to make a personal argument during the guilt phase of the trial.\r\nThe PCR court was correct in finding Franklin did not knowingly and\r\nintelligently waive his right under section 16-3-28.\r\nII. Prejudice\r\n\r\nThe State argues the PCR court\r\nerred in granting Franklin a new trial because Franklin did not show he was\r\nprejudiced under Strickland by the lack of waiver. We agree and hold\r\nFranklin should have been required to show prejudice under Strickland.\r\nIn order to prevail in a PCR\r\naction, an applicant has to satisfy a two prong test.3 The dissent\r\nargues a violation of a statutory right, in this case of section 16-3-28, should\r\nbe analyzed under a different standard than other PCR claims. This Court has\r\nnever made such a distinction. In analyzing a PCR claim, this Court applies a Strickland\r\nprejudice standard. As discussed below, this Court in Torrence, supra,\r\nabolished in favorem vitae review in part because of its faith in the PCR\r\nsystem. The Court held that where counsel fails to object to an error committed\r\nduring trial, PCR would be the proper and effective forum for a defendant to\r\nbring his claims. In a PCR proceeding, the applicant has always had the burden\r\nof demonstrating prejudice. This Court has never made a distinction between\r\nfailure to object to a statutory violation and failure to object to any other\r\ntype of error. First, he must show his counselâ€™s performance fell below an\r\nobjective standard of reasonableness. Secondly, he is required to prove he\r\nsuffered prejudice as a result of counselâ€™s deficient performance. Strickland\r\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 88 L. E. 2d 908 (1984); Johnson\r\nv. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997). To prove prejudice, an\r\napplicant must show there is a reasonable probability that but for counselâ€™s\r\ndeficient performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id.\r\nFranklin has met his burden as to the first prong of the test by showing his\r\ncounsel did not apprise him of his rights under section 16-3-28 and did not\r\nobject to the trial courtâ€™s failure to obtain a waiver. The State contends\r\nFranklin must also prove prejudice in this case, while Franklin argues South\r\nCarolina case law provides he is not required to show prejudice in this\r\ninstance. We find Franklin is required to prove prejudice.\r\nFranklin is correct in observing\r\nthat prior South Carolina cases have not undertaken a prejudice analysis when\r\nholding the defendant was entitled to a new trial on the ground the court failed\r\nto obtain a waiver of allocution rights under section 16-3-28. However, this is\r\nthe first case which addresses this issue on post conviction relief.4\r\nIn State v. Reed, 293 S.C. 515, 362 S.E.2d 13 (1987), we reversed\r\ndefendantâ€™s murder conviction on the ground he did not knowingly and\r\nintelligently waive his right to make a personal closing statement. This Court\r\nstated, &quot;Speculation as to whether appellant was prejudiced by being denied\r\nhis right to final argument is inappropriate in this situation.&quot; Id.\r\nat 518. Additionally, in State v. Orr, 304 S.C. 185, 403 S.E.2d 623\r\n(1991), State v. Charping, 313 S.C. 147, 437 S.E.2d 88 (1993), and State\r\nv. Cooper, 312 S.C. 90, 439 S.E.2d 276 (1994), we held that failure to\r\nobtain a knowing and voluntary waiver of the statutory rights under section\r\n16-3-28 was alone ground for reversal. In none of these cases did the Court\r\nundertake a prejudice analysis.5\r\nHowever, all of these cases were\r\ndecided before our decision in Torrence, supra, where this Court\r\nabolished in favorem vitae review of death penalty cases. As discussed in\r\ndetail in Torrence, the reasons and basis for the Courtâ€™s adoption of in\r\nfavorem vitae review no longer exist. When in favorem vitae\r\nreview was established, the appellate review system did not include a post\r\nconviction relief system. Presently, with such a system in place, the Court\r\nreasoned, &quot;In situations where an objection is not made due to alleged\r\nineffective assistance of defense counsel, we hold the more preferable method of\r\nexploring this issue is via the avenue of an application for post conviction\r\nrelief.&quot; Torrence, 305 S.C. at 66, 406 S.E.2d at 326. In the instant\r\ncase, Franklinâ€™s counsel failed to make an objection, and the proper review of\r\nthis alleged error is in an application for post conviction relief. In a post\r\nconviction proceeding, the applicantâ€™s burden has always been to demonstrate\r\nprejudice. Strickland, supra.\r\nThe facts of the instant case are\r\na clear illustration why due process is not offended by, and public policy\r\nsupports, the application of a prejudice analysis to this type of statutory\r\nerror. First, we note the harmless error rule and a prejudice analysis are no\r\nstrangers to cases involving the death penalty. For example, the United States\r\nSupreme Court has approved the application of a harmless error analysis in death\r\npenalty cases even when a defendantâ€™s constitutional rights have been\r\nviolated. See Yates v. Evatt, 500 U.S. 391, 111 S. Ct. 1884, 114 L. E. 2d\r\n432 (1991) (jury charge on malice unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof\r\nfrom the State to the defendant, nonetheless the constitutional violation was\r\nsubject to harmless error analysis); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279,\r\n111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. E. 2d 302 (1991) (admission of an involuntary confession\r\nsubject to a harmless error analysis); Chapman v. California, 386 U.S.\r\n18, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. E. 2d 705 (1967) (harmless error analysis used where\r\nstate prosecutor's argument and trial judge's instruction continuously and\r\nrepeatedly impressed to the jury that since defendant refused to testify, all\r\nthe inferences from facts in evidence had to be drawn in state's favor). Our\r\nCourt has also acknowledged the appropriateness of a harmless error analysis\r\neven when a defendantâ€™s constitutional rights have been violated. See\r\nArnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992), cert. denied,\r\n507 U.S. 927, 113 S.Ct. 1302, 122 L.Ed. 2d 691 (1993) (in this death penalty\r\ncase, the malice instruction was found to be in violation of Sandstrom v.\r\nMontana, 422 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. E. 2d. (1979), thus\r\nunconstitutional, but subject to harmless error standard).\r\nSecond, we note this error\r\noccurred during the guilt phase, where the jury is confined to determining\r\nwhether Franklin committed the crime, not whether he deserved the death penalty.\r\nHad Franklin been apprised of his right to address the jury during closing, and\r\nhad he chosen to do so,6 he would have been arguing for his\r\ninnocence, not pleading for his life. However, the jury had already heard\r\nFranklin argue for his innocence when he testified in his own defense. Franklin\r\ntestified he had consensual sexual intercourse with the victim on the date of\r\nthe murder, but he denied killing the victim. Therefore, the jury had the\r\nopportunity to hear and consider Franklinâ€™s side of the story. The fact that\r\nFranklin did appear before the jury during the guilt phase, even if his\r\nappearance was not during the closing, demonstrates due process and fundamental\r\nfairness were not offended by the error.\r\nThird, it is important to note\r\nthe policy behind a harmless error and prejudice analysis. These rules are\r\nrooted in the fundamental goal of the criminal justice system - that no citizen\r\nforfeit his life or liberty unless found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As\r\ndiscussed below, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt the correct man was found\r\nguilty of this crime. Based on a review of the evidence presented, we can find\r\nno evidence whatsoever the jury would have rendered a different verdict had the\r\nerror not been made.\r\nFinally, the evidence of guilt in\r\nthis case is overwhelming. The facts in brief are as follows. Victim Jennifer\r\nMartin and family members attended a cousinâ€™s wedding earlier in the day.\r\nThereafter, Jennifer visited her grandmother, then drove to her motherâ€™s house\r\nabout 11:00 p.m. to use the telephone. Her mother left the house shortly before\r\nJennifer arrived. Jennifer had a ten minute conversation with her fiancÃ©,\r\nbeginning at 11:13 p.m. Shortly after midnight, less than 45 minutes after the\r\nvictim had spoken with her fiancÃ©, police found Jenniferâ€™s car abandoned\r\nacross town with the engine running and the lights on. Police determined\r\nownership, proceeded to the motherâ€™s house, and discovered Jenniferâ€™s badly\r\nbattered, partially nude body. She had been raped, violently beaten, and\r\nsexually assaulted with a broomstick. The post mortem examination demonstrated\r\nthat Jennifer suffered many pre-mortem injuries. The photographs introduced at\r\ntrial showed extensive pre-mortem injuries, and these injuries led the jury to\r\nfind the aggravating circumstance of physical torture. Franklinâ€™s own\r\ntestimony placed him at the scene of the crime. It is impossible to believe a\r\nreasonable juror could find the violent brutality of this murder to be the\r\nresult of consensual sex, as Franklin claimed. Furthermore, Franklinâ€™s bloody\r\npalm print was left on the fan that crushed the victimâ€™s head. DNA analysis\r\nconfirmed the semen found on the victimâ€™s body belonged to Franklin. Necklaces\r\nbelonging to the victim were found in Franklinâ€™s possession. Blood on Franklinâ€™s\r\npants matched the blood found on the fan and victim. Considering the evidence of\r\nguilt and malice outlined above,7 Franklinâ€™s testimony in front of\r\nthe jury, and his attorneyâ€™s closing argument, there is no reasonable\r\npossibility Franklinâ€™s failure to make a personal closing argument to the jury\r\nduring the guilt phase of his trial contributed in any way to his convictions.\r\nIn conclusion, we find a\r\nprejudice analysis is appropriate for the error committed in this case.8\r\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, both the Unites States Supreme Court and\r\nthis Court have held a harmless error analysis is appropriate where a capital\r\ndefendant has suffered a deprivation of a constitutional right. It is\r\nhard to reason why a statutory right, enacted by our state legislature, should\r\nbe given a higher importance than rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. To the extent State v. Orr, State v. Cooper, State\r\nv. Charping, and State v. Reed hold differently, they are overruled.\r\nSince there is no reasonable probability that but for counselâ€™s deficient\r\nperformance, the result of Franklinâ€™s trial would have been different, we find\r\nFranklin suffered no prejudice. We reverse the PCR courtâ€™s order granting\r\nFranklin a new trial.9\r\nIII. Non-Murder Convictions\r\n\r\nFranklin argues the PCR court\r\nerred in denying him relief on his non-murder convictions of burglary, grand\r\nlarceny, and criminal sexual conduct after finding he had not knowingly and\r\nintelligently waived his right to address the jury at the close of the guilt\r\nphase. In light of our holding above, reinstating Franklinâ€™s murder\r\nconviction, it is not necessary to reach the merits of Franklinâ€™s argument.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE\r\nin part the findings of the PCR court and reinstate Franklinâ€™s murder\r\nconviction.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ.,\r\nconcur. PLEICONES, J. dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: We\r\ngranted cross-petitions for certiorari to review a post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\norder granting respondent-petitioner (Franklin) a new trial on his capital\r\nmurder charge but denying him relief on the other three convictions10\r\narising out of his death penalty trial. The majority reverses the order granting\r\nFranklin relief and therefore does not reach the remedy issue he raises. I would\r\ngrant Franklin a new trial on the murder charge only, and therefore respectfully\r\ndissent.\r\nA. Stateâ€™s Petition\r\nThe PCR judge found, and the\r\nmajority agrees, that Franklin was never informed of his statutory right to\r\nargue to the jury during the guilt phase of his trial. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 16-3-28 (Supp. 2000). Based on this finding, the judge granted relief on two\r\ngrounds:\r\n\r\n        (1) Franklinâ€™s trial\r\n        counselâ€™s performance was ineffective in violation of the sixth\r\n        amendment;11 and\r\n        (2) Franklinâ€™s\r\n        conviction was obtained &quot;in violation of the . . . laws of this\r\n        State .. ..&quot;12\r\n        \r\n\r\nAs explained below, I agree that\r\nFranklin cannot prevail on his ineffective assistance claim. I would hold,\r\nhowever, that the violation of state law which occurred here compels us to grant\r\na new trial.\r\ni. Ineffective Assistance\r\nIn order to obtain relief on an\r\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, a PCR applicant must establish both\r\nthat his counselâ€™s performance fell below an objective standard of\r\nreasonableness and that he was prejudiced by counselâ€™s deficient performance. Strickland\r\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Brown v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533\r\nS.E.2d 308 (2000). In this case, there is no question but that Franklinâ€™s\r\ntrial attorneys performed below professional norms. Their admitted failure to\r\nreview the applicable statutes when they undertook to represent this individual\r\ncharged with capital murder should undermine our confidence in the integrity of\r\nour judicial system. No defendant, most especially one facing the death penalty,\r\nshould be afforded such perfunctory representation.\r\nFranklinâ€™s sixth amendment claim\r\nalso requires that he demonstrate prejudice, that is, &quot;a reasonable\r\nprobability that, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, the result of the\r\nproceeding would have been different.&quot; Strickland v. Washington, 466\r\nU.S. at 694. Even where, as here, counselsâ€™ performance has deprived the\r\ndefendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitled him, he\r\nmust establish Strickland prejudice in order to prevail. Williams v.\r\nTaylor, 592 U.S. 362 (2000); see Brown v. State, supra.\r\nWhether there is a reasonable probability that, but for the error the result\r\nwould have been different, is a fact-intensive inquiry. Strickland v.\r\nWashington, 466 U.S. at 695-96. I agree with the majority that, given the\r\noverwhelming evidence of Franklinâ€™s guilt, there is no reasonable probability\r\nthat a jury would have returned a not guilty verdict had Franklin been informed\r\nof, and chosen to exercise, his statutory right to argue to the jury.\r\nI therefore concur in the majorityâ€™s\r\nopinion insofar as it reverses the grant of PCR because of a sixth amendment\r\nviolation.\r\nB. Violation of State Law\r\nWe are free to decide the statutory\r\nviolation issue under the standard we deem appropriate. I would hold that when a\r\ncapital defendant is denied the opportunity to exercise a statutory right\r\nafforded him by our death penalty statutes,13 we must reverse.\r\nIn my opinion, we must honor the\r\nGeneral Assemblyâ€™s prerogative to establish the procedural safeguards which it\r\ndeems necessary to the fair administration of the death penalty. Where the\r\nlegislature has prescribed a departure from the procedures observed in\r\n&quot;ordinary&quot; criminal trials, those deviations should be scrupulously\r\nhonored. I would thus not engage in a prejudice analysis where the undisputed\r\nfacts do not demonstrate a conscious waiver or strategic decision to forego one\r\nof the special protections mandated by the capital statutes. When a capital\r\ndefendant is deprived of the opportunity to exercise one of these statutory\r\nrights, whether through ignorance or design, I would hold that justice requires\r\nwe grant a new trial.\r\nEven if we were to require a\r\nshowing of prejudice, Franklin has met that burden here. In four prior\r\ndecisions, we have granted relief to capital defendants who suffered this same\r\ndelict. See State v. Cooper, 312 S.C. 90, 439 S.E.2d 276 (1996); State\r\nv. Charping, 313 S.C. 147, 437 S.E.2d 88 (1993); State v. Orr, 304\r\nS.C. 185, 403 S.E.2d 623 (1991); State v. Reed, 293 S.C. 515, 362 S.E.2d\r\n13 (1987). In all four cases, the reversals resulted from this Courtâ€™s in\r\nfavorem vitae review. By definition, the error was found to be inherently\r\nprejudicial. See e.g., Drayton v. Evatt, 312 S.C. 4, 8, 430 S.E.2d\r\n517, 519 (1993)(&quot;In favorem vitae review requires us to\r\npainstakingly inspect capital cases to determine whether prejudicial error has\r\nbeen committed in a trial . . . .&quot;). We subsequently abandoned our rule of\r\nautomatic reversal where no waiver of this right to address the jury appeared on\r\nthe record, recognizing that a collateral inquiry may reveal a knowing,\r\nintelligent, and voluntary waiver. See e.g., State v. Rocheville,\r\n310 S.C. 20, 425 S.E.2d 32 (1993) (where trial record is silent on waiver of\r\nright to address jury in guilt phase, issue may be fully explored at PCR to\r\ndetermine whether defendant was adequately informed of right but chose to waive\r\nit for strategic reasons); see also Cartrette v. State, 323 S.C.\r\n15, 448 S.E.2d 553 (1994).\r\nIn State v. Torrence, 305\r\nS.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991), this Court agreed to abolish the doctrine of\r\nin favorem vitae because, among other things, the adoption of the Uniform\r\nPost Conviction Relief Act14 in 1969 and the revitalization of the\r\ngreat writ of habeas corpus in 199015 assured that &quot;[O]ther\r\nmechanisms of protection and of relief have now been created for the [capital]\r\ndefendant which safeguard [him] and render the protections afforded by in\r\nfavorem vitae surplusage.&quot; Id. at 61, 406 S.E.2d at 324.16\r\nIn my opinion, if we are to\r\nsafeguard the rights of the capital defendant and follow our precedents, then\r\nthe only issue before this Court is whether there is any evidence of probative\r\nvalue in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that Franklin did not\r\nwaive his statutory right to address the jury at the close of the guilt phase of\r\nhis trial. Humbert v. State , Op. No. 25314 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 25,\r\n2001)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 23 at p. 64); State v. Rocheville, supra.\r\nI disagree with the majorityâ€™s decision applying the Strickland\r\nprejudice standard to our analysis of this state law issue. The effect of\r\nimposing this requirement is to place a virtually insurmountable obstacle in the\r\nway of a convicted capital defendant who has been deprived of one of these\r\nstatutory rights.17\r\nB. Franklinâ€™s Petition\r\nFranklin contends the PCR court\r\nerroneously limited relief to the murder charge alone. I disagree. See State\r\nv. Cooper, supra; State v. Charping, supra (both\r\nreversing only the murder conviction for lack of a waiver of the right to\r\nclosing argument in the guilt phase).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, I would \r\n  affirm the issues raised in the Stateâ€™s petition and the issue raised in Franklinâ€™s \r\n  petition. Accordingly, I would affirm the PCR order granting a new trial on \r\n  the murder charge only.\r\n\r\n1.   The trial court did\r\nobtain an on-the-record waiver during the penalty phase of the trial.\r\n2.   During the penalty\r\nphase of the trial the following colloquy between the defense and the court\r\noccurred:\r\n\r\n      THE COURT: [W]hile weâ€™re doing it I want\r\n      him to understand that he also has the right - as he did at the last\r\n      phase - he has the right to make an argument along with you or Mr.\r\n      Carraway, whoever makes the argument. He has the right to speak to the\r\n      jury as well and I need to know whether or not he, you know desires to do\r\n      that.\r\n      I want to make him aware of it, know heâ€™s\r\n      aware of it - was aware before but I want to make sure he was\r\n      aware of it again at this stage . . . I want to know - be sure\r\n      that he understands that he has a right to do both [testify and argue]. .\r\n      . (emphasis added).\r\n      THE COURT: All right, sir, and the same is\r\n      true of your closing argument. Mr. Barr or Mr. Carraway will make the last\r\n      argument. The state has to argue first in this portion of the trial, and\r\n      your lawyers or lawyer has the right to argue last just like he did in the\r\n      last portion of the trial and you have the same right. Youâ€™ve got\r\n      the right - just like you did before - youâ€™ve got the right\r\n      to stand before the jury at this time - at the end of this phase of the\r\n      trial - and tell them anything you want to tell them about yourself or\r\n      about anything about the facts of the case or anything that you want to\r\n      say youâ€™ve got the right to do it.\r\n      And I just want to make you\r\n      aware of that fact and would like to know before - before- we make\r\n      final arguments I would like for you all to come and let me know what his\r\n      intention is just before you make the argument. I donâ€™t want to pin him\r\n      down now. Iâ€™ll let him think about it but Iâ€™m going to - I need to\r\n      know whether heâ€™s waiving his right or whether he wants to do it before\r\n      it happens. Thatâ€™s the thing Iâ€™ve got to get on the record. (emphasis\r\n      added).\r\n\r\nAfter these remarks by the court, neither defense\r\ncounsel made any comment or took any action which would indicate they were\r\nreceiving this knowledge for the first time. The State argues this inaction by\r\nFranklinâ€™s attorneys speaks volumes about their actual knowledge at that time.\r\nThe State further contends this penalty phase inquiry was sufficient to appraise\r\nand to verify the preexisting knowledge of Franklin and his counsel of the right\r\nas it existed in the guilt phase. We find this passing reference in the penalty\r\nphase does not imply Franklin waived his right during the guilt phase.\r\nThe judgeâ€™s comments were too little and too late.\r\n3.   Franklin asserts two\r\nseparate grounds for relief: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel; and (2)\r\ndenial of his right under section 16-3-28. We analyze under the Strickland\r\nprejudice standard, however, the same result would be reached under the harmless\r\nerror standard. An error is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected\r\nthe result of the trial. State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241\r\n(1990). Although the Strickland prejudice standard arguably places a\r\ngreater burden on the defendant than the showing required to obtain reversal on\r\ndirect appeal, the overwhelming evidence of guilt, as discussed below, negates\r\nany claim that the denial of Franklinâ€™s right under section 16-3-28 could have\r\n&quot;reasonably affected the result&quot; of his trial.\r\nThe dissent argues a violation of a statutory\r\nright, in this case of section 16-3-28, should be analyzed under a different\r\nstandard than other PCR claims. This Court has never made such a distinction. In\r\nanalyzing a PCR claim, thisCourt applies a Strickland prejudice standard.\r\nAs discussed below, this Court in Torrence, supra, abolished in\r\nfavorem vitae review in part because of its faith in the PCR system. The\r\nCourt held that where counsel fails to object to an error committed during\r\ntrial, PCR would be the proper and effective forum for a defendant to bring his\r\nclaims. In a PCR proceeding, the applicant has always had the burden of\r\ndemonstrating prejudice. This Court has never made a distinction between failure\r\nto object to a statutory violation and failure to object to any other type of\r\nerror.\r\n.4.   Although it could be\r\nargued that a harmless error analysis is also appropriate on direct appeal, note\r\nthat in Cartrette and Rocheville, this Court stated a PCR\r\nproceeding was the appropriate forum for addressing the issue of voluntary\r\nwaiver under section 16-3-28, therefore in the future, the issue is unlikely to\r\nbe addressed on a direct appeal.\r\n5.    The\r\nPCR courtâ€™s order relied on these cases when holding Franklin did not have to\r\nshow prejudice in order to be entitled to relief. \r\n6.    Even\r\nif Franklin was aware of his right to argue, it is unlikely he would have chosen\r\nto do so. Franklinâ€™s attorneys testified they did not think Franklin should\r\npersonally address the jury during the penalty phase since he did not make a\r\ngood impression on the jury during his guilt phase testimony.\r\n7.    For\r\na more detailed discussion of the evidence of guilt and malice displayed by\r\nFranklin at the crime scene see State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456\r\nS.E.2d 357 (1995).  \r\n8.The dissent argues imposing\r\na prejudice analysis places a &quot;virtually insurmountable obstacle&quot; in\r\nthe way of a convicted capital defendant. While there may be some instances\r\nwhere prejudice may be presumed because of the nature and circumstances\r\nsurrounding the error, this is not one of those rare instances. The error in\r\nthis case occurred during the guilt phase of Franklinâ€™s trial. Had he\r\nexercised his statutory right under section 16-3-28 during the guilt phase, he\r\nwould have argued for the jury to believe his side of the story. As discussed\r\npreviously, Franklin exercised his opportunity to testify and tell the jury his\r\nside of the story. The jury received all the overwhelming evidence, including\r\nFranklinâ€™s own testimony, and rendered a verdict of guilty. Nothing in the\r\nfacts or circumstances surrounding this guilt phase error makes a prejudice\r\nanalysis inappropriate or a &quot;virtually insurmountable obstacle.&quot;\r\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, both the\r\nUnites States Supreme Court and this Court have held a harmless error analysis\r\nis appropriate where a capital defendant has suffered a deprivation of a constitutional\r\nright. It is hard to reason why a statutory right, enacted by our state\r\nlegislature, should be given a higher importance than rights guaranteed by the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n9.  For\r\nfurther policy arguments concerning the appropriateness of a prejudice analysis\r\nin this case see Charping, supra (Goolsby, AAJ, joined by Justice Toal,\r\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). \r\n10. Franklin\r\nwas convicted of murder, first degree burglary, first degree criminal sexual\r\nconduct, and grand larceny. See State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47,\r\n456 S.E.2d 357 (1995). \r\n11. \r\nU.S. Const. amend. VI. \r\n12. \r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(1)(1985). \r\n13. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20 through -28 (Supp. 2000). \r\n14. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 through -160 (1988 and Supp. 2000). \r\n15. \r\nSee Butler v. State, 302 S.C. 466, 397 S.E.2d 87 (1990). \r\n16. \r\nAmong the other grounds advanced for the abolition of the doctrine was &quot;the\r\nadvances in the quality of legal representation.&quot; Id. at 60, 406\r\nS.E.2d at 324. As this case demonstrates, we must not assume that capital\r\ndefendants will necessarily be afforded competent representation. \r\n17.  Since the ultimate\r\nsanction is reserved for the &quot;worst of the worst,&quot; it will be a rare\r\ndeath row inmate who can demonstrate a &quot;reasonable probability&quot; of a\r\ndifferent outcome where, for example, the statutory waiting period required\r\nbetween the guilty verdict and the commencement of the penalty phase is not\r\nobserved, or even where separate sentencing and penalty hearings are not held. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
