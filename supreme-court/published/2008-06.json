Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-610 and Â§ 4-9-620 (1986).\r\nThe powers and\r\n  duties of the administrator include:Â  executing the policies, directives, and\r\n  legislative actions of the council; preparing budgets for submission to the\r\n  council and, in the exercise of that responsibility, having the authority to\r\n  require such reports, estimates, and statistics on an annual or periodic basis\r\n  as the administrator deems necessary from all county departments and agencies;\r\n  preparing annual, monthly, and other reports for council on finances and\r\n  administrative activities of the county; and performing such other duties as\r\n  may be required by the council.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-630 (1986).\r\nThe Administrator\r\n  was hired by the Council in 1996.Â  Wilson, who was sworn into office in 2001,\r\n  is one of seven members who comprise the Council.Â  Since being sworn into\r\n  office, Wilson has sought from the Administrator various financial records pertaining\r\n  to the operation of county government.Â  At the time of Wilsonâ€™s 2005 deposition,\r\n  she had received over 59,000 pages of documents from the Administrator.Â  Wilson stated that she shares the information she receives from the Administrator with the\r\n  media and the Anderson County Taxpayers Association.\r\n In response to Wilsonâ€™s requests, the Council adopted an ordinance in 2003 involving the prioritization\r\n  of the Administratorâ€™s duties.Â  Wilson was the lone dissenting vote.Â  The\r\n  ordinance states:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    performing the duties of his office, the Administrator shall be governed by the\r\n    following prioritization of functions:Â  those duties established by law or\r\n    contract, by the Anderson County Code, by the South Carolina Code of Laws, by\r\n    the Administratorâ€™s contract with the County; those duties required for the\r\n    efficient and effective day-to-day operations and functioning of County\r\n    government; other duties, as time permits after completion of the first two\r\n    sets of priorities.\r\n\r\nSpecifically in\r\n  regard to this appeal, Wilson sought vendor files where legal expenditures were\r\n  described, an annual financial report, weekly copies of the general ledger\r\n  report, and records containing information concerning details of transfers\r\n  between accounts in excess of $2,500.\r\nAfter determining\r\n  the Administrator was failing to give her the documents in a timely and\r\n  complete manner, Wilson sought a writ of mandamus that would allow her full\r\n  access to all financial records pertaining to the operation of the county\r\n  government.Â  The trial court granted the Administratorâ€™s motion for summary\r\n  judgment on the ground that the Administratorâ€™s duties in regard to the above\r\n  documents are discretionary.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err by ruling\r\n  mandamus cannot issue to compel the Administrator to disclose financial records\r\n  to a county council member?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err by ruling\r\n  mandamus cannot issue to compel the Administrator to disclose to Wilson the narratives in the County&rsquo;s legal bills?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA\r\n  lower court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe\r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Connor Holdings, LLC v. Cousins, 373\r\n  S.C. 81, 644 S.E.2d 58 (2007).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of\r\n  fact exist, the lower court must view the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n  the non-moving party.Â  Id.\r\nThe primary purpose\r\n  of a writ of mandamus is to\r\n  enforce an established right and to enforce a corresponding imperative duty\r\n  created or imposed by law.Â  Riverwoods, LLC v. County of Charleston,&nbsp;349 S.C. 378, 563 S.E.2d 651&nbsp;(2002). Â To\r\n  obtain a writ of mandamus requiring the performance of an\r\n  act, the petitioner must show:Â  (1) a duty of respondent to perform the act;\r\n  (2) the ministerial nature of the act; (3) the petitionerâ€™s specific legal\r\n  right for which discharge of the duty is necessary; and (4) a lack of any other\r\n  legal remedy.Â  Id.Â  Whether to issue a writ of mandamus lies within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court, and an appellate court will not overturn that decision unless the trial\r\n  court abuses its discretion.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Election Commâ€™n,&nbsp;336 S.C. 174, 519 S.E.2d\r\n  567&nbsp;(1999). Â Mandamus is based on the\r\n  theory that an officer charged with a purely ministerial duty can be compelled\r\n  to perform that duty in case of refusal.Â  Id.\r\nThe duties of\r\n  public officials are generally classified as ministerial and discretionary\r\n  (or quasi-judicial).Â  Redmond v. Lexington County Sch. Dist. No. Four, 314 S.C. 431, 445 S.E.2d 441 (1994).Â  The character of an officialâ€™s\r\n  public duties is determined by the nature of the act performed.Â  Long v.\r\n    Seabrook,&nbsp;260 S.C. 562, 197 S.E.2d 659 (1973).Â  The duty is\r\n  ministerial when it is absolute, certain, and imperative, involving merely the\r\n  execution of a specific duty arising from fixed and\r\n  designated facts.Â  Redmond, supra.Â  It is ministerial if it is\r\n  defined by law with such precision as to leave nothing to the exercise of\r\n  discretion.Â  Id.Â  In contrast, a quasi-judicial duty requires the\r\n  exercise of reason in the adaptation of means to an end, and discretion in\r\n  determining how or whether the act shall be done or the course pursued.Â  Id.\r\nI.&nbsp;Financial Records\r\nIn\r\n  her complaint, Wilson alleged she has sought and repeatedly been denied copies\r\n  of the annual financial report (GLR 153), and timely copies of the weekly\r\n  general ledger reports (GLR 110).\r\nWilsonâ€™s complaint\r\n  regarding the GLR 153 was that she wanted to receive an unaudited version immediately\r\n  at the end of the fiscal year.Â  The Administrator informed her that the annual\r\n  report was typically only run after the audit was completed and all required\r\n  adjustments had been made due to the volume and cost associated with running\r\n  the report.Â  She was told she would be promptly provided with the report after\r\n  all accounts were closed out and the external audit finalized.Â  A finance\r\n  department employee stated that an unaudited version of the report is not very\r\n  relevant because certain items are overstated or understated.Â  Wilson was given the 2004 GLR 153 in December 2004, after the audit was complete.\r\nRegarding the GLR\r\n  110s, Wilsonâ€™s complaint is that she receives them in bunches of four to six\r\n  and she believes she is entitled to receive them weekly, i.e. immediately\r\n  after the finance department completes them.\r\nIn his deposition,\r\n  the Administrator stated that he provides Wilson with the GLR 110s as soon as\r\n  he can.Â  However, he noted that he likes to review them first so that he may\r\n  anticipate Wilsonâ€™s future inquiries.Â  He stated that sometimes he did not have\r\n  time to review them and so there would be a delay in delivery.\r\nWilson previously moved\r\n  twice before Council that Council, as a body, instruct the Administrator to\r\n  provide the ledger reports in a timely manner for their review.Â  The motions\r\n  died for lack of a second.\r\nWilson argues the\r\n  trial court erred by ruling that a writ of mandamus cannot issue to compel the\r\n  Administrator to disclose financial records to a county council member in a\r\n  particular manner or time frame.Â  She contends that the Administratorâ€™s duty to\r\n  do so is ministerial and not discretionary.\r\nWe find that providing\r\n  a council member with the county financial information in a particular time\r\n  frame or manner are discretionary actions on the Administratorâ€™s part.Â  The law\r\n  does not require the Administrator to give the documents to a single council\r\n  member in any particular manner.Â  See Â§ 4-9-630 (outlining\r\n  administratorâ€™s powers and duties); Long v. Seabrook, supra (duty\r\n  is ministerial when it is absolute, certain, and imperative, involving merely\r\n  the execution of a specific duty arising from fixed and designated facts).Â  We\r\n  emphasize the Administrator cannot deny a council member access to county\r\n  financial documents.[1]Â \r\n  However, here, the Administrator has not denied Wilson access to the\r\n  documents.Â  The Administrator, in his discretion, has delayed the delivery of\r\n  some documents so that he may be able to respond to queries by Wilson.Â  Further, the Council, acting as a whole with only Wilson dissenting, has enacted\r\n  an ordinance prioritizing the Administratorâ€™s duties so as to ensure that the Administrator\r\n  takes care of the Countyâ€™s business before fulfilling Wilsonâ€™s requests.Â \r\n  Additionally, the Council has twice declined to accept Wilsonâ€™s motion to\r\n  require the Administrator to produce documents in a timelier manner.Â  Given all\r\n  these circumstances, the Administratorâ€™s duty to deliver documents to Wilson is a quasi-judicial duty which requires the exercise of his discretion in\r\n  determining how the act of delivering the documents shall be done.Â  See Redmond, supra (quasi-judicial duty requires the exercise of discretion in\r\n  determining how or whether the act shall be done or the course pursued).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  trial court did not err by ruling a writ of mandamus cannot issue to compel the\r\n  Administrator to deliver the Countyâ€™s financial documents to Wilson in a\r\n  particular manner or within a particular time frame.[2]\r\nII.&nbsp;Legal Bill Narratives\r\nIn 2001,\r\n  Wilson requested copies of the complete legal vendor files.Â  She was given\r\n  copies of the legal fees of the countyâ€™s law firm summarized by fund.Â  In 2003,\r\n  Wilson was given a listing of general legal expenditures for the year 2002\r\n  through March 2003.\r\nWilson requested again in November 2003 for the complete\r\n  vendor files.Â  In response to this request, the Administrator sent a memorandum\r\n  to all members of the Council.Â  In this memo, he stated that Wilsonâ€™s request\r\n  for copies of vendor files â€œwhere legal expenditure questions are concernedâ€ is\r\n  attorney-client privileged information with the County being the client.Â  The\r\n  Administrator informed the Council that only the Council, acting as a corporate\r\n  body, can authorize the release of those records to anyone, acting as an\r\n  individual.Â  He stated that if Council authorized and directed the release,\r\n  then Wilson could have the records; otherwise, the records would not be\r\n  released.\r\n The next month, Wilson requested the legal expense files from 1997 to 2003.Â  The Administrator responded\r\n  and attached a summary of all of the Countyâ€™s law firm fees and expenses\r\n  summarized by fiscal year.Â  The amounts were categorized and she was also given\r\n  a list of the check numbers and the dates.Â  The Administrator emphasized that\r\n  only the Council could authorize the release of narrative detail of those\r\n  records.\r\nIn 2004, Wilson made a Freedom of Information Act request for the legal expense vendor files,\r\n  including a narrative of billable hours supporting each payment.Â  The\r\n  Administrator gave Wilson the legal expense vendor files, with the narratives\r\n  redacted.Â  At the October 5, 2004, Council meeting, Wilson moved that Council,\r\n  as a body, instruct the Administrator to provide the legal expense vendor\r\n  files.Â  The motion died for lack of a second.\r\nAt a subsequent Council\r\n  meeting, the Countyâ€™s attorney made a presentation.Â  He stated he is the legal\r\n  adviser to the County and that the County is his client.Â  The attorney stated\r\n  the narrative descriptions at issue involved the Countyâ€™s legal strategy and\r\n  that it is attorney-client privileged information.Â  He stated only the Council\r\n  acting for the County can release that information and the Administrator cannot\r\n  waive that privilege.\r\nThe Administrator\r\n  stated that when a request for a document is made, he consults with the\r\n  Countyâ€™s legal counsel and asks whether it is attorney-client privileged\r\n  information.Â  His determination is based on legal advice he receives from the\r\n  Countyâ€™s attorney.\r\nIn her deposition, Wilson agreed that the description of the legal work in the bills may reveal litigation\r\n  strategy.Â  Wilson admitted that if she was given the legal narratives and she\r\n  saw something that was â€œsilly,â€ she would release the information to the public.\r\nInitially, Wilson argues the lower court erred by not reviewing the legal bill narratives in\r\n  camera when making its decision.Â  However, Wilson did not request that they\r\n  be reviewed in camera below and she did not raise this argument until on\r\n  appeal.Â  In any event, the trial court was not required to actually review the\r\n  legal bill narratives to determine if the privilege existed.Â  We have held that\r\n  the trial court must determine the question of privilege without first\r\n  requiring disclosure of the substance of the communication.Â  State v. Doster,\r\n  276 S.C. 647, 284 S.E.2d 218 (1981).[3]Â  See also Tucker v. Honda of South Carolina Mfg., Inc., 354 S.C.\r\n  574, 582 S.E.2d 405 (2003) (trial court should not require disclosure of\r\n  attorney client communications to other parties without first determining\r\n  whether the communications are privileged by inquiring into all the facts and\r\n  circumstances of the communication; if necessary to determine the\r\n  application of the privilege, the trial judge may consider, in camera,\r\n  the material); State v. Love, 275 S.C. 55, 271 S.E.2d 110 (1980)[4] (whether a communication is privileged is for the trial judge to decide in the\r\n  light of a preliminary inquiry into all of the facts and circumstances; and\r\n  this determination is conclusive in the absence of an abuse of discretion).Â  In\r\n  the instant case, in light of the fact that Wilson never requested such an in\r\n    camera review, the trial court did not abuse his discretion by determining\r\n  the existence of the privilege without reviewing the narratives in the legal\r\n  bills.\r\nThe attorney-client\r\n  privilege is based upon a public policy that the best interest of society is\r\n  served by promoting a relationship between the attorney and the client whereby\r\n  utmost confidence in the continuing secrecy of all confidential disclosures\r\n  made by the client within the relationship is maintained.Â  State v. Doster, supra.Â  The attorney-client privilege belongs to the client and not the\r\n  attorney, and may be waived only by the client.Â  Tucker v. Honda of South Carolina Mfg., Inc., supra.\r\n  Â In general, the burden of establishing the privilege rests upon the party\r\n  asserting it. Â State v. Love,&nbsp;supra.\r\nWilson argues the\r\n  Administrator should not be making judgments about what is subject to the\r\n  attorney-client privilege.Â  However, when a request for a document is made, the\r\n  Administrator consults with the Countyâ€™s attorney and asks whether it is\r\n  attorney-client privileged information.Â  The determination of what is\r\n  privileged information is based on legal advice the Administrator receives from\r\n  the Countyâ€™s attorney.Â  Therefore, we find the Administrator is not making the\r\n  determination but is relating the information he receives from the Countyâ€™s\r\n  attorney to the Council when a request is made for possibly privileged\r\n  documents.\r\nWilson, as a council member, cannot independently review\r\n  attorney-client privileged documents.Â  The privilege belongs to the client County; and the Council, as a whole, is authorized to release that information and has\r\n  to waive the privilege before an individual council member can review\r\n  privileged documents.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(7) (2007) (a\r\n  public body may but is not required to exempt from disclosure the following\r\n  information:Â  correspondence or work products of legal counsel for a public\r\n  body and any other material that would violate attorney-client relationships).Â \r\n  The trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding a writ of mandamus\r\n  cannot issue against the Administrator to compel him to release information\r\n  where the Council has not authorized such a release.Â  See Redmond, supra (quasi-judicial duty requires discretion in determining how\r\n  or whether the act shall be done or the course pursued); Charleston County Sch. Dist., supra (appellate court will not overturn decision\r\n  not to issue a writ of mandamus unless the trial court abuses its discretion).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial\r\n  court did not err by ruling a writ of mandamus cannot issue to compel the\r\n  Administrator to deliver the countyâ€™s financial documents to Wilson in a\r\n  particular manner or within a particular time frame.Â  We further find the trial\r\n  court did not err by ruling a writ of mandamus cannot issue to compel the\r\n  Administrator to release attorney-client privileged information without\r\n  authorization by the client County.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial\r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWALLER, J., concurs. TOAL,\r\n  C.J., concurring in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs. BEATTY,\r\n  J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â Â Â Â  Although I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to\r\n  deny Appellant Wilsonâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, I write separately\r\n  because I believe that this dispute is not a proper matter for this Courtâ€™s\r\n  consideration.Â  In seeking the disclosure of the financial records in such a\r\n  particular form and manner, Appellant essentially asks the Court to delve into\r\n  internal disputes among Anderson County Council members and to overturn the\r\n  Councilâ€™s decisions.[5]Â \r\n  In my view, issues related to the propriety of Respondentâ€™s actions in this\r\n  case present purely political questions, the resolution of which rests solely\r\n  within the Councilâ€™s domain.Â  In my opinion, any ruling from this Court would\r\n  impermissibly operate as judicial review of the Councilâ€™s policy decisions, and\r\n  I would decline Appellantâ€™s request to intrude in this area.Â  See S.C. Pub. Interest Found. v. Judicial Merit\r\n    Selection Commâ€™n, 369\r\n  S.C. 139, 142-43, 632 S.E.2d 277, 279 (2006) (observing that adjudication of nonjusticiable political questions would place a court in\r\n  conflict with a coequal branch of government, and thus, a court will not rule\r\n  upon questions which are political in nature rather than judicial).Â  For these\r\n  reasons, I would hold that this is a nonjusticiable political question and\r\n  would therefore deny Appellantâ€™s request for a writ of mandamus.Â  \r\nPLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I concur in the opinion of\r\n  the majority that mandamus cannot issue to compel the Administrator to disclose\r\n  attorney-client privileged information.Â  However, my concurrence is limited to\r\n  the facts of this case where Wilson admits that she would disclose the\r\n  privileged information to the public at large.Â  The privilege belongs to the\r\n  Council, not Wilson.\r\n In\r\n  my view, an elected official by virtue of the office held has the inherent\r\n  right of timely access to any and all information possessed by the governmental\r\n  entity that he or she is duly elected to. To hold otherwise would condone the\r\n  disenfranchisement of the people the elected official represents.Â  The denial\r\n  of information would clearly hinder, if not nullify, an elected official in the\r\n  performance of his duties. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent in the\r\n  majorityâ€™s decision that mandamus cannot issue to compel the Administrator to\r\n  disclose financial information to a member of county council.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the Freedom of Information Act requires a governmental entity or other public\r\n  body to disclose the type of financial information requested by Wilson.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30 (a) (2007) (providing that any person has the\r\n  right to copy or inspect a public record); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-50(A)(6)\r\n  (2007) (defining as â€œpublic informationâ€ any â€œinformation in or taken from any\r\n  account, voucher, or contract dealing with the receipt or expenditure of public\r\n  or other funds by public bodiesâ€).Â  This statutory requirement removes any\r\n  discretion on the part of the public body.Â  In this instance, the lack of discretion\r\n  whether to disclose the requested information makes the disclosure ministerial\r\n  in nature and subject to mandamus, but for the injunctive remedy provided by\r\n  section 30-4-100.Â  Further, the county ordinance prioritizing the duties of the\r\n  Administrator is unavailing in its attempt to delay responding to a request for\r\n  financial information of the sort at issue here.Â  Section 30-4-30 allows only\r\n  15 days for a response to a request for information.Â  If the request is granted\r\n  (in this case it must be) the information must be available for review.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]See S.C.

Jonas, of Cotty &amp; Jonas, of Columbia; Gary W. Poliakoff, of Poliakoff &amp; Assoc., PA, of Spartanburg; Gregory M.\r\n          Alford, of Alford &amp; Wilkins, PC, of Hilton Head Island; and C. Bruce\r\n          Littlejohn, of Spartanburg, for appellant.\r\n        Ronald W. Urban and\r\n          Milton G. Kimpson, of South Carolina Department of Revenue; and John J.\r\n          Pringle, Jr. and John Thomas Lay, both of Ellis Lawhorne &amp; Sims, PA, of\r\n          Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant commenced this action as the representative\r\n  of a putative class of persons denied a state sales tax exemption for diabetic\r\n  supplies under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-2120(28)(b) (Supp. 2007).Â  The trial\r\n  court granted summary judgment against appellant on his cause of action under\r\n  the South Carolina Taxpayersâ€™ Bill of Rights and dismissed the remaining causes\r\n  of action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as provided in the\r\nRevenue Procedures Act.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nSection 12-36-2120(28)(b) provides an exemption\r\n  from sales tax for:\r\n\r\n  hypodermic needles, insulin, alcohol\r\n    swabs, blood sugar testing strips, monolet lancets, dextrometer supplies, blood\r\n    glucose meters, and other similar diabetic supplies sold to diabetics under\r\n      the authorization and direction of a physician.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Appellant contends respondent South\r\n  Carolina Department of Revenue (Department) improperly promulgated regulations\r\n  that do not conform to Â§ 12-36-2120(28)(b) because the regulations allow the sales\r\n  tax exemption only for diabetic supplies sold pursuant to a prescription or written\r\n  authorization, which appellant claims is not required under the statute.Â  \r\nThe first regulation challenged is\r\n  the former version of 27 S.C. Reg. 117-174.257 which read:\r\n\r\n  Medicines,\r\n    prosthetic devices and hypodermic needles, insulin, alcohol swabs and blood\r\n    sugar testing strips sold to diabetics to be exempted from the tax must be\r\n      sold on prescription, in writing, by a medical doctor, a dentist, an\r\n    osteopath or a chiropodist.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Although the regulation required a\r\n  â€œprescription,â€ in practice Department required only some form of written\r\n  medical authorization to support the claimed sales tax exemption.Â  The\r\n  regulation was subsequently changed to conform to this practice and effective\r\n  June 2001 was amended to provide:\r\n\r\n  Hypodermic needles, insulin, alcohol\r\n    swabs, blood sugar testing strips, monolet lancets, dextrometer supplies, blood\r\n    glucose meters, and other similar diabetic supplies sold to diabetics are only\r\n    exempt if sold pursuant to the written authorization and direction of a\r\n      physician.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Finally, the\r\n  regulation was recodified as 27 S.C. Reg. 117-332 with no change in substance. \r\nAppellant sought damages from Departmentâ€™s\r\n  promulgation of these regulations and alleged several causes of action\r\n  including a violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-58-170 (2000), which was formerly\r\n  part of the South Carolina Taxpayersâ€™ Bill of Rights.[1]Â \r\n  This section provided:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;If any\r\n    employee of the department wilfully, recklessly, and intentionally\r\n      disregards department published procedures, a taxpayer aggrieved by that\r\n    action may bring an action for damages against the State of South Carolina in Circuit Court but not against any state employee.\r\n  (B) In\r\n    action (sic) brought under subsection (A), upon a finding of liability\r\n    on the part of the State of South Carolina, the State is liable to the\r\n    plaintiff in an amount equal to the sum of actual and direct monetary damages\r\n    sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the actions or omissions.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The trial court found this section did\r\n  not apply to Departmentâ€™s promulgation of regulations and granted Departmentâ€™s\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  Further, the trial court dismissed appellantâ€™s\r\n  causes of action seeking disgorgement of tax revenue on the ground appellant\r\n  had failed to exhaust administrative remedies as provided by the Revenue\r\n  Procedures Act. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1. Was\r\n    appellantâ€™s cause of action under Â§ 12-58-170 properly dismissed?\r\n  2. Was\r\n    injunctive or mandamus relief properly denied?\r\n  3. Must\r\n    appellant exhaust administrative remedies under the Revenue Procedures Act?\r\n  4. Should a\r\n    declaratory judgment action be allowed under Â§ 1-23-150?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Section\r\n  12-58-170\r\nAs noted above, Section 12-58-170\r\n  provided in pertinent part that a taxpayer could bring a cause of action for\r\n  damages when an employee of Department â€œwilfully, recklessly, and intentionally\r\n  disregards department published procedures.â€Â  Appellant contends Department\r\n  wilfully, recklessly, and intentionally disregarded the diabetic supplies sales\r\n  tax exemption statute, Â§ 12-36-2120(28)(b), when Department promulgated its\r\n  regulations.Â  \r\nThe trial court ruled that\r\n  appellantâ€™s complaint failed to state a cause of action under Â§ 12-58-170\r\n  because this section specifically refers to â€œdisregard[ing] department\r\n  published proceduresâ€ which does not include the alleged disregard of a\r\n  statute.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nUntil repealed, Â§ 12-58-170 was\r\n  part of Chapter 58, Title 12, entitled the South Carolina Taxpayersâ€™ Bill of\r\n  Rights.Â  This chapter deals with Departmentâ€™s treatment of taxpayers in the\r\n  context of taxpayer complaints (Â§12-58-30), tax information and education (Â§\r\n  12-58-50 &amp; -60), collection of taxes (Â§ 12-58-70, -90, -100, -110), and\r\n  liens (Â§ 12-58-120 through -160).Â  A plain reading of Â§ 12-58-170 supports the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  See Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 625\r\n  S.E.2d 636 (2006) (words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand\r\n  the statuteâ€™s operation).Â  Statutes, which are enacted by the General Assembly,\r\n  are not published by Department; nor do statewide statutes qualify as\r\n  â€œdepartment procedures.â€ Â Department procedures are essentially Departmentâ€™s\r\n  directives to its employees regarding internal procedures.Â  \r\nFurther, we find the trial court\r\n  properly ruled that the promulgation of a regulation cannot be accomplished by\r\n  the willful, reckless, or intentional act of a Department employee.Â  As\r\n  provided by statute, regulations are promulgated only upon notice and public\r\n  hearing, then submitted to the General Assembly for review and approval before\r\n  enactment by the legislature.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1- 23-110-120 (2005 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nFinally, appellant alleges Department\r\n  employees violated Department published procedures regarding the promulgation\r\n  of regulations.Â  The subject of the procedures referenced by appellant includes\r\n  the dissemination of policy documents to the public and the use of various\r\n  documents such as revenue rulings, revenue procedures, private letter rulings,\r\n  technical advice memoranda, and information letters.Â  The trial court correctly\r\n  concluded appellant has shown no violation of a Department procedure to support\r\n  a cause of action under Â§ 12-58-170.\r\n2. Injunction or\r\n  mandamus relief\r\nThe trial court denied appellantâ€™s\r\n  request for injunctive or mandamus relief to enjoin the collection of sales tax\r\n  on diabetic supplies.Â  The court relied on the Revenue Procedures Act, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-60 (Supp. 2007), which provides:\r\n\r\n  An action of a court or administrative\r\n    law judge cannot stay or prevent the department or an officer of the State\r\n    charged with a duty in the collection of taxes, from acting to collect a tax,\r\n    whether or not the tax is legally due.\r\n\r\nThis section plainly provides that a court may not enjoin\r\n  the collection of taxes.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly refused\r\n  injunctive or mandamus relief as provided in Â§ 12-60-60.\r\n3.Â  Failure to\r\n  exhaust administrative remedies\r\nAppellantâ€™s complaint includes\r\n  causes of action for unjust enrichment and breach of constructive trust.Â  He\r\n  contends these are equitable causes of action that should not have been\r\n  dismissed for failure to pursue administrative remedies under the Revenue\r\n  Procedures Act.Â  Because the relief sought in these causes of action is a\r\n  disgorgement of tax monies collected, they are governed by the Revenue\r\n  Procedures Act and are limited to the remedies provided therein as stated in\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-80 (2005):\r\n\r\n  (A)Â  Except as provided in subsection\r\n    (B),[2] there is no remedy other than those provided in this chapter in any case\r\n    involving the illegal or wrongful collection of taxes, or attempt to collect\r\n    taxes.\r\n\r\nThe trial court properly ruled that these causes of action\r\n  are governed by the Revenue Procedures Act.\r\n4.Â  Declaratory\r\n  judgment under Â§ 1-23-150\r\nAppellantâ€™s fifth cause of action\r\n  is a request for a declaratory judgment that S.C. Reg. 117-332 exceeds\r\n  Departmentâ€™s authority.Â  Appellant contends it was error to dismiss this cause\r\n  of action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Revenue\r\n  Procedures Act.Â  We agree.\r\nSection Â§ 1-23-150\r\n  (2005) provides:\r\n\r\n  Â§ 1-23-150. Appeals contesting\r\n    authority of agency to promulgate regulation.\r\n  Â (a) Any person may petition an agency\r\n    in writing for a declaratory ruling as to the applicability of any regulation\r\n    of the agency or the authority of the agency to promulgate a particular\r\n    regulation.Â  The agency shall, within thirty days after receipt of such\r\n    petition, issue a declaratory ruling thereon.[3]\r\n  (b) After compliance with the\r\n    provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, any person affected by the\r\n    provisions of any regulation of an agency may petition the Circuit Court for a\r\n    declaratory judgment and/or injunctive relief if it is alleged that the\r\n    regulation or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or\r\n    threatens to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the\r\n    plaintiff or that the regulation exceeds the regulatory authority of the\r\n    agency.Â  The agency shall be made a party to the action.\r\n\r\nThe trial court ruled the Revenue Procedures Act, rather\r\n  than this section, applies because the Revenue Procedures Act is a more\r\n  specific and more recently enacted law.Â  See Langley v. Pierce,\r\n  313 S.C. 401,Â  438 S.E.2d 242 (1993) (generally, specific laws prevail over\r\n  general laws, and later legislation takes precedence over earlier legislation).\r\nWhile it is correct that a more specific statute\r\n  usually prevails, in this instance we conclude the Revenue Procedures Act,\r\n  although more specific to cases regarding the collection of taxes, cannot apply\r\n  because of the limitation on the authority of the Administrative Law Court to\r\n  rule on the validity of a regulation.Â  As we have stated:\r\n\r\n  ALJs[4] are an agency of the executive branch of government and must follow the law as\r\n    written until its constitutionally is judicially determined;Â  ALJs have no\r\n    authority to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute or regulation.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 342 S.C. 34, 38, 535 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2000). Although\r\n  appellant is not challenging the constitutionality of the regulation, he is challenging its validity under state law.Â  Because the Administrative Law Court\r\n  is part of the executive branch, as stated in Video Gaming, it has no\r\n  authority to rule on the facial validity of Reg. 117-332.Â  Appellant therefore may\r\n  pursue this issue as an action for declaratory judgment in circuit court under\r\n  Â§ 1-23-150.[5]Â \r\n  Therefore, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of appellantâ€™s cause of\r\n  action under Â§ 1-23-150 and remand for a determination on the merits.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]This section was repealed effective June 9, 2005,\r\n  after this action was filed. \r\n[2] (B) Notwithstanding subsection (A), an action for a declaratory judgment where\r\n  the sole issue is whether a statute is constitutional may be brought in circuit\r\n  court. This exception does not include a claim that the statute is unconstitutional\r\n  as applied to a person or a limited class or classes of persons.\r\n[3]Appellant states he amended his complaint to allege\r\n  this cause of action under Â§ 1-23-150 after Department declined to â€œrepealâ€ the\r\n  regulation.Â  It is clear from Departmentâ€™s opposition to this lawsuit that\r\n  Department takes the position that the regulation is valid.\r\n[4]The judges of the Administrative Law Court were\r\n  formerly referred to as Administrative Law Judges or â€œALJâ€™s.â€\r\n[5] We note that Â§ 12-60-80(C), which prohibits a\r\n  class action, applies not only to administrative law cases but also to tax\r\n  cases brought in circuit court. Â This section provides:\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding\r\n    subsections (A) and (B), a claim or action for the refund of taxes may not be\r\n    brought as a class action in the Administrative Law Judge Division or any court\r\n    of law in this State, and the department, political subdivisions, or their\r\n    instrumentalities may not be named or made a defendant in any other class\r\n    action brought in this State. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this\r\n  action may not be certified as a class action.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26499","title":"In the Matter of Richard Allen McDowell, Sr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26499","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court suspended a lawyer from the practice of law for two years.","date":"2008-06-02","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Richard Allen\r\n          McDowell, Sr., &nbsp; Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26499\r\nSubmitted April 25, 2008 - Filed June 2, 2008Â Â  \r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.\r\n          Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Ericka M. Williams, Assistant Deputy Disciplinary\r\n          Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        Philip\r\n          Christopher Smith, Jr., of Law Offices of Desa Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a\r\n  public reprimand or the imposition of a definite suspension not to exceed two years.Â \r\n  We accept the Agreement and impose a two year suspension from the practice of\r\nlaw.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn June 2006, respondent was retained to\r\n  represent Complainant A in a domestic matter.Â  He received a partial retainer\r\n  of $1,000.Â  Subsequently, respondent learned that Complainant A had previously\r\n  filed an action for divorce in Oklahoma but that the action had been set\r\n  aside.Â  Respondent represents he informed Complainant A that her situation was\r\n  unique and the he would have to conduct extensive research in the matter. \r\nDuring his representation of\r\n  Complainant A, Complainant A was served with divorce papers from her husband in\r\n  Oklahoma.Â  Respondent represents he informed Complainant A that she needed to\r\n  retain an attorney in Oklahoma to represent her in the Oklahoma action as he was\r\n  not licensed to practice law in that state.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he failed to\r\n  keep Complainant A reasonably informed about the status of her case.Â  He\r\n  further admits he failed to act diligently as he did not do any meaningful work\r\n  on Complainant Aâ€™s case during the five months in which he represented her.Â  Respondent\r\n  refunded Complainant Aâ€™s entire retainer fee.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent\r\n  closed loans on four properties on behalf of Complainant B who was the\r\n  purchaser of the properties. Â Respondent failed to properly record the deed on\r\n  one of the properties which resulted in Complainant B not receiving a tax\r\n  notice and Complainant B paying $295.94 in late fees as a result of\r\n  respondentâ€™s error.Â  Respondent failed to comply with Complainant Bâ€™s\r\n  reasonable request for information as he did not supply a copy of the cancelled\r\n  check submitted to the clerkâ€™s office which would have prevented Complainant B\r\n  from incurring late penalty fees for delinquent taxes on the property.Â  Respondent\r\n  was not properly reconciling his trust accounts and, as a result, did not\r\n  discover the recording problem until contacted by the seller.Â Â  \r\nOn two\r\n  other property purchases, respondent used an incorrect address which resulted\r\n  in Complainant B not receiving the tax notices. Â Complainant B discovered the\r\n  problem when he went to the clerkâ€™s office to check the status of his tax\r\n  notices. \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent was\r\n  retained by Complainant C for purposes of a domestic action.Â  Complainant C was\r\n  an out-of-state resident who met with respondent for the first time the day\r\n  before her first court appearance.Â  Respondent failed to keep Complainant C\r\n  reasonably informed regarding the status of her case and her obligations to\r\n  make child support payments.Â  Respondent failed to return Complainant Câ€™s\r\n  telephone calls and to comply with reasonable requests for information.Â Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nIn\r\n  November or December 2006, respondent was retained by Complainant D to\r\n  represent Complainant Dâ€™s son in a domestic matter.Â  Respondent received $1,300\r\n  towards his fee of $1,500.Â  \r\n In May\r\n  or June 2007, respondent was also retained to secure an official birth\r\n  certificate for Complainant D.Â  He received $500 from Complainant D as the entire\r\n  fee in this matter.\r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to keep Complainant D and Complainant Dâ€™s son reasonably informed\r\n  regarding the status of their cases.Â  Prior to concluding Complainant D and his\r\n  sonâ€™s cases, respondent closed his law firm and withdrew from the practice of\r\n  law.Â  Respondent failed to surrender papers and property to which Complainant D\r\n  and his son were entitled and failed to refund Complainant D and his son any\r\n  advance of fees and expenses that had not been earned or incurred.Â  Â \r\n\r\nMatter V\r\nIn\r\n  August 2006, respondent was retained to represent Complainants E in a domestic\r\n  matter.Â  Respondent was paid a $3,000 retainer.Â  Respondent informed the\r\n  Complainants that he would send a schedule of fees, a copy of his contract, and\r\n  a status report within thirty (30) days.Â  He also informed the Complainants\r\n  that he would provide a final disposition notice and a detailed bill at the conclusion\r\n  of their case.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to keep Complainants E reasonably informed about the status of their\r\n  case.Â  He failed to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information by\r\n  the Complainants and failed to provide them with documents as promised.Â  \r\nPrior to\r\n  concluding Complainantsâ€™ case, respondent closed his law firm and withdrew from\r\n  the practice of law.Â  He failed to give Complainants E reasonable notice of his\r\n  intentions to withdraw from their case, failed to surrender papers and property\r\n  to which they were entitled, and failed to refund any advance payments of fees\r\n  or expenses that had not been earned or incurred by respondent.Â  Â \r\nMatter VI\r\nIn June\r\n  2006, Complainant F retained respondent following a judgment discontinuing her\r\n  child support for her 18-year-old daughter who was in college.Â  Respondent was\r\n  paid $1,000 to represent Complainant F in the action.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to keep Complainant F reasonably informed regarding the status of her\r\n  case and failed to return most of Complainant Fâ€™s telephone calls.Â  Complainant\r\n  F did contact respondent in October 2006.Â  At that time, respondent informed\r\n  her that he was unable to effect service on the opposing party.Â  Complainant F\r\n  had her co-worker pick up the summons from respondent and the co-worker was\r\n  able to effect service on the opposing party.\r\nComplainant\r\n  F received a summons to appear in court in Richland County.Â  Complainant F\r\n  called respondent to inform him that both she and the opposing party resided in\r\n  Lexington County.Â  Complainant F took vacation time from work in order to\r\n  attend the hearing.Â  On the morning of the hearing, respondentâ€™s office\r\n  contacted Complainant F and informed her that the hearing was cancelled and\r\n  would be rescheduled in Lexington County.Â  Â Â \r\nComplainant\r\n  F terminated respondentâ€™s services and demanded a refund of her money.Â  She\r\n  arranged a date and time to meet with respondent to obtain her files and a\r\n  refund but when Complainant F arrived at respondentâ€™s office it was closed,\r\n  locked, and dark.Â  Respondent failed to surrender papers and property to which\r\n  Complainant F was entitled and failed to refund Complainant F any advance\r\n  payment of fees or expenses that had not been earned or incurred by\r\n  respondent.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent was retained to represent\r\n  Complainant G in a domestic matter.Â  He received a total of $6,000 as his fee.Â \r\n  Respondent informed Complainant G that he would bill at the rate of\r\n  $125.00/hour.Â  \r\nRespondent failed to keep Complainant G\r\n  reasonably informed regarding the status of the case.Â  He failed to comply with\r\n  Complainant Gâ€™s request for information and failed to render a full accounting\r\n  regarding Complainant Gâ€™s funds in spite of Complainant Gâ€™s requests for the\r\n  information.Â  Respondent failed to surrender papers and property to which\r\n  Complainant G was entitled and failed to refund to Complainant G any advance\r\n  payments of fees or expenses that had not been earned or incurred by\r\n  respondent.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondent was retained through pre-paid\r\n  legal services to represent Complainant H in a property dispute matter.Â \r\n  Respondent received a $1,000 retainer.Â  \r\nRespondent failed to keep Complainant H\r\n  reasonably informed regarding the status of her case.Â  Prior to concluding the\r\n  case, respondent closed his office and withdrew from the practice of law.Â  He\r\n  failed to give Complainant H reasonable notice of his intentions to withdraw\r\n  from Complainant Hâ€™s case, failed to surrender papers and property to which\r\n  Complainant H was entitled, and failed to refund Complainant H any advance\r\n  payments of fees or expenses that had not been earned or incurred by respondent. \r\nMatter IX\r\nComplainant I retained respondent to\r\n  seek legal guardianship for Complainant Iâ€™s father.Â  Prior to concluding\r\n  Complainant Iâ€™s case, respondent closed his law firm and withdrew from the\r\n  practice of law.Â  Respondent failed to give Complainant I reasonable notice of\r\n  his intention to

that had not been earned\r\n  or incurred by respondent.Â  \r\nMatter X\r\nRespondent was retained to assist\r\n  Complainant J in an adoption matter.Â  Prior to concluding the matter,\r\n  respondent closed his law firm and withdrew from the practice of law.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to give Complainant J reasonable notice of his intention to\r\n  withdraw from Complainant Jâ€™s case, failed to surrender papers and property to\r\n  which Complainant J was entitled, and failed to refund Complaint J any advance\r\n  payments of fees or expenses that had not been earned or incurred by\r\n  respondent.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that\r\n  his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers).Â  In addition, respondent admits he has violated the following\r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with\r\n  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer\r\n  shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter and promptly\r\n  comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.16(d) (upon\r\n  termination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to extent reasonably\r\n  practicable to protect client interests, such as giving reasonable notice to\r\n  client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property\r\n  to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance of payment of fees\r\n  or expenses that has not been earned or incurred); and Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate the Rules of\r\n    Professional Conduct).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and impose a two year definite suspension from\r\n  the practice of law.Â Â Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\n  complied with Rule 30,

Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence\r\n  and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client\r\n  reasonably informed about status of matter and explain matter to client to\r\n  extent reasonably necessary to permit client to make informed decision); Rule\r\n  1.7 (lawyer shall not represent client if representation may be materially\r\n  limited by lawyerâ€™s responsibility to another client unless lawyer reasonably\r\n  believes representation will not be adversely affected); Rule 8.4(a) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage\r\n  in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice).[3]Â  Respondent acknowledges that his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct),\r\n  Rule 7(1)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct\r\n  tending to pollute administration of justice or bring courts or legal\r\n  profession into disrepute); and 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this\r\n  state).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent did not obtain a written conflict\r\n  waiver when undertaking representation in the civil matter.Â  At the time, the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct did not require a written waiver.Â  \r\n[2] Respondent admits he failed to communicate with\r\n  the Complainant concerning this representation but asserts he believed the\r\n  boyfriend had notified her about the agreement.Â  \r\n[3] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the\r\n  effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those\r\n  which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Anderson, of Anderson &amp; Anderson, LLP, of Aiken,Â  for respondent.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this judicial disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to the imposition of a public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE,\r\n  Rule 502, SCACR.[1]Â \r\nThe facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn early January 2007, respondent was\r\n  arrested and charged with two crimes: Â 1) â€œMisconduct in Office.Â  Violation\r\n  Section 8-1-0080/Common Lawâ€ and 2) receiving information in his official\r\n  capacity concerning the unlawful sexual misconduct of a county employee and\r\n  failing to report the information to law enforcement as required by S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-23-1150(E) (Supp. 2007).[2]Â Â \r\n  On or about March 15, 2007, respondent was indicted on both charges in the Aiken County General Sessions Court.Â  In particular, the first indictment for misconduct in office\r\n  alleged respondent had committed acts of fraud and corruption while acting in\r\n  his official capacity as a judge and that he had disregarded his duties to\r\n  enforce the law of the State in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-1-80 (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  The second indictment alleged respondent had received information in\r\n  his professional capacity regarding the sexual misconduct of a county employee\r\n  with a South Carolina Department of Corrections inmate and then failed to\r\n  report the information to the appropriate law enforcement authority in\r\n  violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-23-1150(E) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nOn or about January 30, 2008, respondent\r\n  entered an Alford plea to misconduct in office and the solicitor entered\r\n  a nolle prosequi on the remaining charge.Â  Respondent was sentenced on the same\r\n  day.Â  Â Â Â \r\nRespondent admits the crime to which he\r\n  pled guilty constitutes a â€œserious crimeâ€ as defined by Rule 2(aa), RJDE, Rule\r\n  502, SCACR, in that it adversely reflected upon his honesty, trustworthiness,\r\n  and fitness to hold judicial office, and interfered with the administration of\r\n  justice.Â  Respondent further admits he engaged in inappropriate conduct with a\r\n  county employee.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he\r\n  has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501,\r\n  SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A\r\n  (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high\r\n  standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the\r\n  integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the\r\n    appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and\r\n    comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public\r\n    confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 4A(1)\r\n    (judge shall conduct all extra-judicial activities so that they do not cast\r\n    reasonable doubt on the judgeâ€™s capacity to act impartially as a judge); Canon\r\n    4A(2) (judge shall conduct all extra-judicial activities so they do not demean\r\n    the judicial office); and Canon 4A(3) (judge shall conduct all extra-judicial\r\n    activities so that they do not interfere with proper performance of judicial\r\n    duties).Â  Respondent also admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for\r\n    discipline pursuant to Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for\r\n    judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be\r\n    ground for discipline for judge to be convicted of serious crime), and Rule\r\n    7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Oath of\r\n    Office contained in Rule 502.1, SCACR) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary\r\n    Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall not seek or accept any\r\n  judicial position whatsoever in this State without the express Â written permission\r\n  of this Court after due service on ODC of any\r\n  petition seeking the Courtâ€™s authorization.[3]Â \r\n  Respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On or about June 12, 2007, respondent resigned from\r\n  judicial office.Â  Since he no longer holds judicial office, a public reprimand\r\n  is the most severe sanction the Court can impose.Â  See In re Oâ€™Kelley,\r\n  361 S.C. 30, 603 S.E.2d 410 (2004); In re Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467\r\n  S.E.2d 924 (1996). \r\n[2] On January 10, 2007, the Court placed respondent\r\n  on interim suspension.Â  \r\n[3] As stated in the agreement, if he elects in the\r\n  future to request the Court for permission to seek or accept a judicial\r\n  position, respondent irrevocably consents to allow ODC to disclose to the Court any and all information\r\n  contained in the on-the-record appearances made in this matter without any requirement\r\n  for authenticating the Â testimony from the appearances.Â  Further, respondent\r\n  irrevocably waives any claim of\r\n  confidentiality for purposes of disclosure of the on-the-record appearances. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26502","title":"Sonoco Products Company v.

Â At this\r\n  location, Sonoco owns four buildings which serve as its international\r\n  headquarters and order fulfillment center.Â  The three corporate headquarters\r\n  buildings are located across a public road, Novelty Avenue/Woodmill Street, and\r\n  a railroad track from the majority of the manufacturing plant.Â  Sonoco owns a\r\n  fee simple interest in the road, which is subject to a public right-of-way for\r\n  use as a public road in favor of the South Carolina Highway Department.Â  Sonoco\r\n  also owns the land traversed by the railroad tracks; however, Seaboard Coast\r\n  Line Railroad has been granted a right-of-way and easement to a portion of the\r\n  track.Â  The buildings are located between the manufacturing plant and the order\r\n  fulfillment center.Â  The order fulfillment center, or customer service center,\r\n  is located across Novelty Avenue, the railroad tracks, and Calhoun Street from\r\n  the manufacturing plant.Â  There are no intervening landowners between the manufacturing\r\n  plant and the buildings at issue.\r\nOf\r\n  the three buildings comprising the corporate headquarters, two of the buildings\r\n  were built in 1969 and 1978, respectively.Â  The third building was constructed\r\n  in 1989.Â  The 1969 and 1978 buildings were used in support of the manufacturing\r\n  facility and, at the time of their construction, were assessed at a 10.5\r\n  percent ratio as manufacturing-related property.Â  The 1989 building, the\r\n  corporate headquarters, was attached to the two other administrative buildings\r\n  and was also assessed at a 10.5 percent ratio as manufacturing-related\r\n  property.Â  The order fulfillment center was built in 1997 and was also assessed\r\n  at a 10.5 percent ratio.[1]Â  \r\nOn July 2, 1997,\r\n  Sonoco filed a written protest with the Department in which it submitted that\r\n  the Office Buildings were not contiguous to its plant site because they were\r\n  separated from the plant site by a public street and, thus, should be assessed\r\n  at a 6 percent ratio rather than 10.5 percent.Â  In its protest, Sonoco\r\n  requested a tax refund for the property tax years of 1997 and 1998. \r\nOn\r\n  September 23, 2003, the Department issued its final agency determination.Â  In\r\n  its report, the Department stated â€œ[t]he sole issue for the [the Departmentâ€™s]\r\n  determination is whether railroads and public streets destroy contiguity for\r\n  purposes of S.C. Code Ann. Section 12-43-220 (2000).â€[2]Â \r\n  The Department rejected Sonocoâ€™s argument and denied its request for a refund.Â \r\n  In reaching this decision, the Department found our applicable state statutes\r\n  and regulations â€œindicate that intervening roads, rights-of-way, and railroad\r\n  tracks do not destroy contiguity.â€ Â In reviewing these statutes and regulations,\r\n  the Department believed the Legislature has â€œrepeatedly expressed its\r\n  reluctance to destroy contiguity when two tracts are separated by a street,\r\n  railroad track, or other public way.â€Â  In addition to this statutory support,\r\n  the Department also relied upon several appellate court decisions to find that\r\n  Sonocoâ€™s â€œheadquarters facility is contiguous to the plant site and should\r\n  remain assessed for property tax purposes at 10Â½ %.â€\r\nIn\r\n  response to the Departmentâ€™s decision, Sonoco contested the final agency\r\n  determination before the ALC. Â Prior to the hearing, the parties entered into a\r\n  stipulation of facts.Â  Based on these stipulations and the evidence presented\r\n  at the hearing, the ALC affirmed the Departmentâ€™s determination and held that\r\n  â€œSonocoâ€™s headquarters office buildings and order fulfillment center are\r\n  contiguous to the plant site and all property taxes computed thereon should be\r\n  calculated using a 10Â½ % assessment ratio.â€ \r\nSonoco\r\n  appealed the ALCâ€™s decision to the circuit court.Â  After hearing oral\r\n  arguments, the circuit court issued its written order reversing the ALC and\r\n  holding that Sonocoâ€™s office buildings are entitled to a 6 percent assessment\r\n  ratio.Â  In reaching this decision, the circuit court specifically found that\r\n  â€œ[w]hen the taxpayerâ€™s office building and plant site are separated by a public\r\n  road, there is a clearly defined, intervening land area with legal boundaries\r\n  demarcating the two land areas, and the plant site and the office building may\r\n  be readily distinguished.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  Department appealed the circuit courtâ€™s order to the Court of Appeals. Â This\r\n  Court certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals. Â The parties stipulate\r\n  the amount at issue before this Court is a refund of $866,580.44 with interest,\r\n  plus an additional refund reflecting a 6 percent assessment ratio on the land\r\n  surrounding the buildings.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  Department raises three issues with multiple subparts; however, we believe the\r\n  sole issue is whether the circuit court erred in finding Sonocoâ€™s office\r\n  buildings, which are separated from its manufacturing plant by a public road\r\n  and railroad, are not contiguous to the plant site. \r\nIn reaching its\r\n  decision that the presence of a public road between Sonocoâ€™s plant site and\r\n  office buildings destroyed contiguity, the circuit court found the ALC erred in\r\n  the following respects:Â  (1) in construing section 12-43-220(a) to mean that a\r\n  manufacturerâ€™s office buildings and its plant site on opposite sides of a\r\n  public right-of-way are â€œcontiguousâ€ when the manufacturer owns the fee simple\r\n  interest underlying the public right-of-way; and (2) in interpreting section\r\n  12-43-220(a) by ruling that contiguity â€œjumpsâ€ over a public right-of-way.Â  \r\nFor several reasons, we find the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s analysis was erroneous and the ALC correctly decided the issue.Â  The\r\n  ultimate decision in this case is dependent upon the Courtâ€™s determination of\r\n  the term â€œcontiguousâ€ within the meaning of section 12-43-220(a).\r\nThe\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\n  of the Legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578,\r\n  581 (2000).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one\r\n  that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in\r\n  the language used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended\r\n  purpose of the statute.â€ Â Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Commâ€™n,\r\n  342 S.C. 373, 380, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  The court should give words\r\n  their plain and ordinary meaning, without resort to subtle or forced\r\n  construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation. Sloan v. S.C. Bd.\r\n    of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452, 469, 636 S.E.2d 598, 607 (2006). Â â€œWe will reject a statutory interpretation when to\r\n  accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been\r\n  intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.â€Â  Unisun\r\n    Ins.

Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 368, 529 S.E.2d 280, 283 (2000).\r\nAs the\r\n  parties and the presiding courts recognized, the specific statute at issue,\r\n  section 12-43-220(a), does not define the term contiguous.Â  Therefore, we have\r\n  tried to glean an appropriate definition by reviewing secondary sources, our\r\n  state statutes, and our state appellate decisions which deal with the concept\r\n  of contiguity.\r\nIn\r\n  terms of secondary sources, â€œcontiguousâ€ commonly means, â€œbeing in actual\r\n  contact: touching along a boundary or at a point; adjacent; next or near in\r\n  time or sequence.â€Â  Websterâ€™s New Collegiate Dictionary 243 (1981).Â  In\r\n  the legal field, it has been defined as: â€œ[i]n close proximity; neighboring;\r\n  adjoining; near in succession; in actual close contact; touching at a point or\r\n  along a boundary; bounded by or traversed by.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 290 (5th ed. 1979).\r\nAlthough\r\n  not directly on point, other South Carolina statutes are instructive in\r\n  determining how the Legislature views this term.Â  Clearly, when the Legislature\r\n  promulgated section 12-43-220(a) it was aware of the use of the term\r\n  â€œcontiguousâ€ in other statutory schemes. Thus, we believe a review of these\r\n  statutes provides guidance in the instant case.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-43-232(2) (2000) (â€œFor tracts not used to grow timber as provided in item\r\n  (1) of this section, the tract must be ten acres or more. Â Nontimberland tracts\r\n  of less than ten acres which are contiguous to other such tracts which, when\r\n  added together, meet the minimum acreage requirement, are treated as a\r\n  qualifying tract. Â For purposes of this item (2) only, contiguous tracts\r\n    include tracts with identical owners of record separated by a dedicated\r\n    highway, street, or road or separated by any other public way.â€) (emphasis\r\n  added); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-305 (2004) (â€œFor\r\n  purposes of this chapter, â€˜contiguousâ€™ means property which is adjacent to a municipality\r\n  and shares a continuous border. Â Contiguity is not established by a road,\r\n  waterway, right-of-way, easement, railroad track, marshland, or utility line\r\n  which connects one property to another; however, if the connecting road,\r\n    waterway, easement, railroad track, marshland, or utility line intervenes\r\n    between two properties, which but for the intervening connector would be\r\n    adjacent and share a continuous border, the intervening connector does not destroy contiguity.â€) (emphasis added); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  34-28-160(3) (1987) (outlining financial institutions and stating:Â  â€œWith\r\n  prior written notification to the Board, and in order to relieve some of the\r\n  burdens on the public caused by congestion of public streets, roadways, and parking facilities, promote safety of pedestrians on\r\n  public ways, or otherwise serve the needs or convenience of the public, an\r\n  association may operate facilities providing services to customers. Â It is not\r\n  necessary that any facility be a part of, or physically connected to, the main\r\n  structure of the home office or branch if the facility is located on the\r\n  property on which the main structure of the home office or branch is situated\r\n  or on property contiguous thereto. Â Property which is separated from the\r\n    property on which the main structure of the home office or branch is situated\r\n    only by a street and one or more walkways and alleyways is, for the purpose of\r\n    this subsection, considered contiguous.â€) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWe believe the text of these statutes reflects an intention by the\r\n  Legislature to broadly construe and apply the term â€œcontiguous.â€Â  In each of\r\n  the cited statutes, contiguity was not destroyed or defeated by an intervening dedicated\r\n  road or public right-of-way.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the preference for a broad construction is\r\n  illustrated by the text of the Departmentâ€™s regulation which defines â€œplant\r\n  site,â€ and states in pertinent part, â€œ[w]hen possible, a\r\n  plant site will be one contiguous parcel using legal and or natural boundaries.â€ 27\r\n  S.C. Regs. 117-124.4 (1976) (emphasis added).Â  We believe the above-quoted text\r\n  indicates a predilection for sections of a plant site to be contiguous unless\r\n  there is a clear obstruction or barrier which operates to disconnect parcels of\r\n  land.\r\nOur state\r\n  appellate decisions also appear to broadly interpret the term contiguous.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Kizer v. Clark, 360 S.C. 86, 90-91, 600 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2004)\r\n  (citing section 5-1-30 of the South Carolina Code and recognizing that\r\n  marshlands and creeks do not defeat townâ€™s contiguity for annexation purposes); Mosteller v.

Dransfield, Annotation, Different Parts or Parcels of Land in Same\r\n    Ownership As Single Unit or Separate Units for Tax Assessment Purposes, 133\r\n  A.L.R. 524 (1941 &amp; Supp. 2008) (establishing general proposition\r\n  that where lots or lands are contiguous and in one ownership they may be\r\n  assessed as a unit). \r\nFurthermore, we disagree with Sonocoâ€™s assertion that the\r\n  annexation cases are inapposite because â€œin all of those cases, the waterway\r\n  was also part of the annexing municipality.â€Â  Sonocoâ€™s contention actually\r\n  weakens its overall argument.Â  By the same token that a waterway is part of the\r\n  annexing municipality, Sonoco is the fee simple owner of the road at issue and\r\n  the adjoining property.Â  As previously stated, the right-of-way does not\r\n  diminish Sonocoâ€™s ownership of this road.Â  Thus, as in the annexation case,\r\n  there is no intervening landowner in this case that would destroy contiguity.\r\nApplying the\r\n  foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we hold the ALC was correct in finding\r\n  that the Office Buildings are contiguous to Sonocoâ€™s plant site.Â  First, there\r\n  is no barrier or well-defined land area that separates the Office Buildings\r\n  from the manufacturing plant.Â  See Tovey, 237 S.C. at 485, 117\r\n  S.E.2d at 877 (stating in municipal annexation case that â€œ[t]he river does not\r\n  constitute a barrier to complete amalgamation of the communities upon its\r\n  opposite banksâ€).Â  Secondly, there are no intervening landowners. Â As the\r\n  parties stipulated, Sonoco owns a fee simple interest in the roads and railroad\r\n  that separates the Office Buildings from the manufacturing plant.Â  Finally, the\r\n  presence of the public right-of-way and easement for Novelty Avenue and the\r\n  railroad should not operate to defeat viewing the plant site as a unified area.Â \r\n  Significantly, the circuit court recognized this fact when it stated,\r\n  â€œ[c]ertain portions of the Plant Site are located across additional public\r\n  streets (for example, the Spiral Division and the Bleachery are located across\r\n  the Patrick Highway [also known as Miller Avenue] and the Machine Manufacturing\r\n  building is located across Third Avenue).â€Â  We would also note that plant\r\n  employee and tractor trailer parking are located on the same side of Novelty Avenue as the Office Buildings. Â Thus, Sonocoâ€™s plant site is not limited to the\r\n  immediate area surrounding the manufacturing plant, but instead, expands\r\n  significantly beyond the confines of the plant over the adjoining roads.\r\nAs\r\n  previously stated the Legislature, our state appellate courts, and the\r\n  Department each have broadly construed the term â€œcontiguous.â€Â  However, even\r\n  under Sonocoâ€™s narrow interpretation, which requires an actual â€œtouchingâ€ of\r\n  the parcels to establish contiguity, that definition would be satisfied in the\r\n  instant case.Â  Because Sonoco owns the fee simple interest in the property and\r\n  there are no intervening landowners, the parcels on which the Office Buildings\r\n  are located are â€œtouchingâ€ the plant site and, thus, are contiguous.Â \r\n  Furthermore, although the roads at issue allow for public use, which Sonoco\r\n  contends defeats contiguity, the primary purpose of these roads is to provide\r\n  ingress and egress to the manufacturing plant.Â  Obviously, as Sonoco points\r\n  out, there is no actual manufacturing on the road at issue.Â  However, the\r\n  transportation of raw materials and the finished product sufficiently relates\r\n  to manufacturing.Â  Thus, the roads are â€œdirectly related to manufacturing,â€ as\r\n  required by Regulation 117-124.4 to be considered part of the â€œplant site.â€Â  Additionally,\r\n  the Office Buildings themselves are not separate entities from the\r\n  manufacturing plant.Â  Arguably, the Office Buildings and the manufacturing\r\n  plant are inextricably linked by the fact that the items produced in the\r\n  manufacturing plant would not be distributed but for the operations in these\r\n  administrative and customer service buildings.Â  To find that a road owned by a\r\n  manufacturer on its plant site, but used by the public, defeated contiguity\r\n  under section 12-43-220, we believe would be in contravention of what the\r\n  Legislature intended.\r\nThe\r\n  Legislature amended section 12-43-220 to provide for a reduced 6 percent tax\r\n  assessment ratio in order give a tax break to manufacturers for office\r\n  buildings that are used or leased for purposes clearly unrelated to\r\n  manufacturing.Â  Illustrative of this point is the testimony of one of the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s employees, Charles McLean.Â  McLean testified before the ALC that\r\n  Sonoco has several offices in Hartsville that are assessed at the lower 6\r\n  percent ratio.Â  These buildings include an office leased by a law firm, a YMCA,\r\n  and an industrial property.Â  McLean testified these buildings were at least\r\n  one-half mile away from Sonocoâ€™s manufacturing plant and there were several\r\n  intervening landowners between the plant and these office buildings.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  order to effectuate the intent of the Legislature, we find the word\r\n  â€œcontiguousâ€ within the context of section 12-43-220 should be broadly\r\n  construed.Â  To read it narrowly would provide manufacturers a tax reduction\r\n  which is neither warranted nor intended by the Legislature.Â  We do not believe\r\n  the Legislature contemplated that a manufacturer could defeat contiguity in\r\n  order to receive the reduced tax assessment ratio merely by granting a\r\n  right-of-way for a road located on its plant site.Â  Because Sonoco owns the property\r\n  which separates the office buildings from the plant site, we do not believe the\r\n  presence of the public right-of-way over Novelty Avenue/Woodmill Street or the easement for the railroad operates to destroy contiguity.Â  Thus, we\r\n  believe the circuit court erred in reversing the order of the ALC.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Both parties stipulated that the buildings\r\n  constitute â€œoffice buildingsâ€ as defined in section 12-43-220(a) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code.Â  S.C.

Â This Court\r\n  granted certiorari to review the decision of the court of appeals.Â  We reverse\r\n  the decision of the court of appeals and reinstate the general jury verdict for\r\n  Petitioner.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nBefore\r\n  delivering her son in February 1997, Respondent Marty Cole (â€œColeâ€) discussed\r\n  the various delivery options with her obstetrician, Petitioner Dr. Pratibha\r\n  Raut (â€œDr. Rautâ€).Â  Cole had previously delivered a baby by caesarian section\r\n  (or C-section), but Dr. Raut recommended that Cole undergo a â€œvaginal birth\r\n  after caesarian section,â€ known as a VBAC.Â  At the time, VBAC was the\r\n  recommended method of delivery despite the risk that the uterine scar from Coleâ€™s\r\n  previous C-section could rupture and cause the baby to suffer harm from oxygen\r\n  deprivation.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Raut discussed the risks of a VBAC delivery with Cole and her husband during a\r\n  prenatal visit two days before giving birth, and the next day, Cole informed\r\n  Dr. Raut that she wanted to attempt a VBAC.Â Â  Because she was two weeks past\r\n  her due date, Dr. Raut scheduled Cole to have labor induced the following day\r\n  at Chester Memorial Hospital.Â  When Cole reported to the hospital the following\r\n  day, the nurse obtained Coleâ€™s written informed consent before beginning the\r\n  labor and delivery process.Â  The consent form documented Coleâ€™s consent to a VBAC\r\n  delivery, induction of labor through medication, and augmentation of labor with\r\n  medication, and also indicated Coleâ€™s authorization to delivery by C-section if\r\n  necessary.Â  Specifically, the form provided: \r\n\r\n  I\r\n    recognize that during the course of the operation, unforeseen conditions may\r\n    necessitate additional or different procedures or services that [sic] those set\r\n    forth above and I further authorize and request that the above named surgeon .\r\n    . . perform such procedures as are, in his professional judgment, necessary and\r\n    desirable.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Raut induced\r\n  labor at 8:00 a.m. intending to deliver Coleâ€™s baby by VBAC, yet retaining a\r\n  surgical crew on-call in case an emergency C-section became necessary.[1]Â \r\n  Labor progressed slowly and at 1:30 the following morning, the fetal heart\r\n  monitor began indicating changes in the babyâ€™s heart rate.Â  These changes did\r\n  not appear abnormal to the nursing staff.Â  However, by 2:00 a.m., further\r\n  changes in the babyâ€™s heart rate prompted nurses to administer oxygen to Cole\r\n  and to summon Dr. Raut, who was already present at the hospital, to the\r\n  delivery room.Â  When she viewed the babyâ€™s heart rate monitor, Dr. Raut became\r\n  concerned and attempted to notify the on-call surgical crew, which had already\r\n  been summoned to the hospital to attend to another emergency, that it needed to\r\n  remain there.Â  Because the on-call crew was still operating on the emergency\r\n  patient,Â  Dr. Rautâ€™s initial call to the operating room went unanswered, and it\r\n  was not until 2:10 a.m. that the operating room received formal standby notice.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  2:15 a.m., Cole began to complain of abdominal pains, indicating that her\r\n  uterine wall had ruptured, and at 2:20 a.m., Dr. Raut formally ordered an\r\n  emergency C-section for Cole.Â  The C-section began at 2:42 a.m. and son Kyle\r\n  was born at 2:45 a.m.Â  Kyle suffered from brain damage and related problems,\r\n  including cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and a seizure disorder.Â  As a\r\n  result of these conditions, Kyle died in August 2003.\r\nThe Coles brought a\r\n  medical negligence action in their individual capacities and on behalf of Kyle\r\n  against Dr. Raut and her medical practice.Â  The Coles alleged that Dr. Rautâ€™s\r\n  delay in ordering the emergency C-section and failure to deliver Kyle in a timely\r\n  manner by C-section resulted in fetal oxygen deprivation causing Kyleâ€™s various\r\n  medical conditions and his ultimate death.Â  At trial, expert witnesses for the\r\n  Coles testified that Dr. Raut was negligent in failing to order a C-section at\r\n  2:00 a.m. when the heart rate monitor first indicated troublesome variables in\r\n  Kyleâ€™s heart rate.Â  The Colesâ€™ expert obstetrician further testified that in\r\n  accordance with American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology standards, the\r\n  surgical team should have been able to deliver Kyle in this manner by 2:30 a.m.\r\n  at the latest, and that in his opinion, delivery by no later than 2:33 a.m. would\r\n  have resulted in a neurologically healthy baby.Â  This testimony differed\r\n  slightly from that of the Colesâ€™ expert witness on neonatalogy who opined that\r\n  permanent brain damage had almost certainly occurred by 2:30 a.m.Â  Conversely,\r\n  expert witnesses for the defense testified that Dr. Raut did not deviate from\r\n  the standard of care with respect to ordering Kyleâ€™s delivery by C-section because\r\n  there was nothing to indicate an emergency until 2:20 a.m., at which time Dr.\r\n  Raut promptly ordered the C-section.Â  The defense also emphasized that the\r\n  hospital had only one operating crew available at this hour, and that this crew\r\n  was performing an emergency procedure on another patient when Dr. Raut first expressed\r\n  concern.\r\nAt\r\n  the close of evidence, the trial court granted Dr. Rautâ€™s earlier motion to\r\n  amend her pleadings to include assumption of the risk as an affirmative\r\n  defense, but denied the doctorâ€™s request for a special verdict form.Â  Â The\r\n  trial court instructed the jury on the law of negligence followed by a charge\r\n  on the doctrine of assumption of the risk, and the jury returned a general\r\n  verdict in favor of Dr. Raut.Â  The Coles moved for a new trial on the grounds\r\n  that the court erroneously charged the jury on the doctrine of assumption of\r\n  the risk because Cole had not assumed the risk of a delayed C-section.Â  The\r\n  trial court denied the Colesâ€™ motion and the Coles appealed.Â Â Â  \r\nThe court of\r\n  appeals initially affirmed the trial courtâ€™s judgment in favor of Dr. Raut\r\n  based on the application of the two-issue rule.Â  After the Colesâ€™ petitioned\r\n  for rehearing, the court of appeals reversed the case and remanded, finding\r\n  that that the trial courtâ€™s erroneous charge on assumption of the risk\r\n  prejudiced the Coles and that the two-issue rule did not apply to uphold the\r\n  jury verdict.Â  Cole v. Raut, 365 S.C. 434, 617 S.E.2d 740 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  This Court granted certiorari, and Dr. Raut raises the following issue for\r\n  review: \r\nDid the\r\n  court of appeals err in finding that the trial courtâ€™s jury instructions on the\r\n  defense of assumption of the risk constituted reversible error?Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions unless the trial\r\n  court committed an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339\r\n  S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or is\r\n  not supported by the evidence.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDr.\r\n  Raut argues that the court of appeals erred in finding that the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  jury instructions on the defense of assumption of the risk constituted\r\n  reversible error, and we agree. \r\nAs a\r\n  primary matter, we find that the court of appeals correctly held that the trial\r\n  court erred in charging the jury on assumption of the risk.Â  A jury charge consisting\r\n  of irrelevant and inapplicable principles may confuse the jury and constitutes\r\n  reversible error where the\r\n  juryâ€™s confusion affects the outcome of the trial.Â  State v. Washington,\r\n  338 S.C. 392, 400, 526 S.E.2d 709, 713 (2000).Â  In order for the\r\n  doctrine of assumption of the risk to apply in a particular case, the injured\r\n  party must have freely and voluntarily exposed himself to a known danger which\r\n  he understood and appreciated.[2]Â  Faile v. Bycura,Â  289 S.C. 398, 399, 346 S.E.2d 528, 529 (1986). \r\nIn this\r\n  case the assumption of the risk charge was improper because even if Cole\r\n  assumed the risk with respect to the VBAC procedure by signing the consent\r\n  form, Cole did not simultaneously assume the risk of any danger specifically\r\n  associated with a delayed C-section delivery, which is the basis for the Colesâ€™\r\n  medical negligence claim.Â  The court of appeals found, and we agree, that the\r\n  record does not indicate that Cole recognized any danger posed by a delay\r\n  between the doctorâ€™s observation of the warning signs indicating the need for a\r\n  C-section delivery and actual commencement of a C-section delivery.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Cole was not aware of the possible circumstances under which such a delay might\r\n  occur.Â  Accordingly, Cole could not understand and appreciate the nature and\r\n  extent of the danger of a delay.Â  Therefore, the court of appeals correctly\r\n  found that the trial court erred in charging assumption of the risk. Â Â \r\nAn\r\n  erroneous jury instruction, however, is not grounds for reversal unless the\r\n  appellant can show prejudice from the erroneous instruction.Â  Ellison v.\r\n    Simmons, 238 S.C. 364, 372, 120 S.E.2d 209, 213 (1961).Â  From this premise,\r\n  the majority writing for the court of appeals found that the jury charge on\r\n  assumption of the risk constituted reversible error because the charge â€œhad the\r\n  potential to confuse the jury concerning the underlying factual basis of the\r\n  Colesâ€™ claims and availed Raut with a defense that was not supported by the\r\n  evidence.â€Â  Cole, 365 S.C. at 443, 617 S.E.2d at 744.Â  We disagree with this\r\n  conclusion.\r\nAn\r\n  examination of the jury charges is instructive in this matter.Â  After giving\r\n  the charge on negligence and the doctrine of assumption of the risk, the trial\r\n  court concluded with the following explanation:Â  \r\n\r\n  I charge\r\n    you, if you find that the plaintiff freely and voluntarily exposed herself to a\r\n    known danger and understood and appreciated the danger, then in such\r\n    circumstance your verdict would be for the defendant.Â  However, I charge you,\r\n    on the other hand, if you find that the plaintiffâ€™s injuries and negligence\r\n    were the result of the defendantâ€™s negligence, then in such circumstance, your\r\n    verdict would be for the plaintiff.Â  \r\n\r\nConsidering\r\n  the entire jury charge in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial, we\r\n  conclude that the erroneous charge on assumption of the risk was not\r\n  prejudicial to the Coles.Â  In this matter, the parties set forth two very clear\r\n  and very distinct theories of the case:Â  the Coles argued that Dr. Raut was\r\n  negligent in failing to order the C-section by 2:00 a.m., while Dr. Raut maintained\r\n  that her actions were not negligent and that under the particular hospital\r\n  conditions, she did everything in her power to timely deliver a healthy baby.Â  Therefore,\r\n  although erroneous, we believe that the assumption of the risk charge had\r\n  little effect on the juryâ€™s consideration of the evidence presented under\r\n  either partyâ€™s theory of the case.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the trial court clarified any potential confusion resulting from the erroneous\r\n  charge by definitively establishing that the jury should find for the Coles if\r\n  Kyleâ€™s injuries resulted from Dr. Rautâ€™s negligence.Â  See Proctor v. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Health and Envtâ€™l Control, 368 S.C. 279, 319, 628 S.E.2d 496, 518 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (â€œIf the [jury] charge is reasonably free from error,\r\n  isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible\r\n  error.â€).Â  It would be far too speculative on the part of this Court to find prejudicial\r\n  error given the evidence presented at trial on the apparent insufficiency of available\r\n  staff and facilities in this small hospital at this early hour, as well as\r\n  testimony from medical experts explaining that Dr. Raut was not negligent in ordering\r\n  Coleâ€™s C-section when she did.Â  Accordingly, without a more specific argument\r\n  showing how the Coles were prejudiced, we hold that the erroneous charge on\r\n  assumption of the risk does not amount to reversible error.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  turn next to the court of appealsâ€™ analysis of the two-issue rule.Â  Under the\r\n  two-issue rule, when a jury returns a general verdict in a case involving two\r\n  or more issues or defenses, and the verdict is supported as to at least one issue\r\n  or defense that has been presented to the jury free from error, the verdict\r\n  will not be reversed.Â  Gold Kist, Inc. v. C &amp; S Natâ€™l Bank, 286 S.C.\r\n  272, 282, 333 S.E.2d 67, 73 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The application of the two-issue\r\n  rule is separate and distinct from a prejudicial error inquiry, and operates to\r\n  uphold a jury verdict that is sustained by the facts of the case.Â  The rule is\r\n  consistent with the established notion that the appellate courts in this State\r\n  â€œexercise every reasonable presumption in favor of the validity of a general\r\n  verdict.â€Â  Id. at 282, 333 S.E.2d at 73.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, applying the two-issue rule in a secondary analysis creates\r\n  additional sustaining grounds for our holding that the trial courtâ€™s charge on\r\n  assumption of the risk is not reversible error.Â  Here, the jury rendered a\r\n  general defense verdict after hearing a properly submitted negligence claim and\r\n  an erroneous charge on assumption of the risk.[3]Â \r\n  As described in the prejudice analysis above, we find there was ample evidence at\r\n  trial from which a jury could have concluded that Dr. Raut was not negligent in\r\n  rendering medical assistance during Coleâ€™s labor and delivery.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  general verdict for Dr. Raut may be sustained because it is independently\r\n  supported by the negligence claim which was properly submitted to the jury.Â \r\n    See also Dropkin v. Beachwalk Villas Condominium Assn., 373 S.C. 360, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 808 (Ct. App. 2007) (affirming a general defense verdict under the\r\n  two-issue rule where plaintiff alleged error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of a\r\n  directed verdict on the issue of negligence, but where the record contained\r\n  evidence supporting a defense verdict on the issue of proximate cause); Bryant\r\n    v. Waste Management, Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 536 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 2000) (applying\r\n  the two-issue rule to determine that an erroneous instruction on negligence per\r\n  se was not prejudicial to the defendant where there existed other theories of\r\n  liability supported by ample evidence in the record upon which the jury could\r\n  have based its verdict for the plaintiff); Sierra v. Skelton, 307 S.C.\r\n  217, 414 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 1992) (applying the two-issue rule to affirm a\r\n  general jury verdict for the plaintiff where the trial court erred in\r\n  submitting the issue of abuse of process to the jury but the defendant alleged\r\n  no error in submitting the plaintiffâ€™s remaining claim to the jury).\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we find that the court of appeals misinterpreted this Courtâ€™s opinion in Anderson  v. S.C. Dept. of Highways &amp; Public Transportation, 322 S.C.\r\n  417, 472 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1996), in rejecting the applicability of the\r\n  two-issue rule in the instant case.Â  In Anderson, the plaintiff sued the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) alleging negligent\r\n  maintenance of a sidewalk on which she fell and injured herself.Â  Id. at 419, 472 S.E.2d at 254.Â  The plaintiff moved for a directed verdict as to\r\n  liability, but the trial court deferred ruling on the motion and submitted the\r\n  case to the jury on the issues of general negligence and contributory negligence.Â  Id.Â  After the jury returned a general verdict for SCDOT, the\r\n  trial court granted the plaintiffâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the issue\r\n  of negligent maintenance of the sidewalk, and subsequently granted a new trial\r\n  on the basis that it was impossible to determine whether the jury reached its\r\n  verdict based on the plaintiffâ€™s failure to prove improper maintenance, the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s failure to prove proximate cause, or SCDOTâ€™s success in proving\r\n  contributory negligence.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the court of appeals reversed the trial courtâ€™s grant of a new trial on\r\n  the grounds that the trial court should have sustained the juryâ€™s verdict\r\n  pursuant to the two-issue rule.Â  This Court granted certiorari and affirmed in\r\n  result, but declined to adopt the court of appealsâ€™ â€œunusual\r\n  applicationâ€ of the two-issue rule.Â  Id. at 421, 472 S.E.2d at 255.Â  The\r\n  Court reasoned that first, the two-issue rule is utilized by appellate courts,\r\n  and not trial courts; second, the rule is a procedural tool for upholding, not\r\n  reversing decisions; and third, the practical effects of the court of appealsâ€™\r\n  analysis - which essentially required a trial court to invoke the two-issue\r\n  rule whenever necessary to uphold a juryâ€™s verdict - would discourage trial\r\n  courts from correcting errors at the trial level.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the Court rejected the court of appealsâ€™ application of the two-issue rule to\r\n  the facts of Anderson.\r\nThe\r\n  facts of the instant case do not implicate the limitations of the two-issue\r\n  rule articulated by the Court in Anderson.Â  First, in the instant case,\r\n  this Court is examining the application of the two-issue rule in the context of\r\n  appellate review.Â  Next, the Court is applying the rule in this case to uphold\r\n  the judgment of the trial court.Â  Finally, application of the rule in the\r\n  context of this case does not discourage trial courts from correcting errors,\r\n  but rather, functions in the exact capacity for which the rule was intended.Â  For\r\n  these reasons, applying the two-issue rule to the erroneous jury charge in the\r\n  instant case would not be â€œunusual.â€Â  Conforming to the court of appealsâ€™\r\n  analysis of Anderson in the decision below, in our view, would\r\n  effectively abolish the two-issue rule in South Carolina.Â  Â \r\nFurthermore, nothing in this\r\n  Courtâ€™s jurisprudence suggests, as the dissent would, excluding cases presented\r\n  on a single theory of liability and a single affirmative defense from the ambit\r\n  of the two-issue rule.Â  To the contrary, in what appears to be the very first\r\n  case in this State to set forth the basic tenets of the two-issue rule, this\r\n  Court observed that â€œa general finding for the plaintiff is sufficient to\r\n  dispose of the issues both on the petition and on the [defendantâ€™s]\r\n  counterclaim.â€Â  Hussman Refrigerator &amp; Supply Co. v. Cash &amp; Carry\r\n    Grocer, Inc., 134 S.C. 191, 196, 132 S.E. 173, 174 (1926).Â  See also Anderson v. West, 270 S.C. 184, 188, 241 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1978) (â€œ[W]here\r\n  a jury returns a general verdict involving two or more issues and its verdict\r\n  is supported as to at least one issue, the verdict will not be reversed.â€).Â \r\n  Accordingly, and because we find that any error in charging assumption of the\r\n  risk was not prejudicial to the Coles in the first instance, we decline to place\r\n  further limitations on the scope of the two-issue rule in our decision today.Â  Â Â \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the general jury verdict for the defense may be affirmed because the jury\r\n  charge on assumption of the risk did not amount to prejudicial error, or in the\r\n  alternative, pursuant to the two-issue rule. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  reverse the court of appeals and reinstitute the trial courtâ€™s judgment in\r\n  favor of Dr. Raut.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice\r\n  Aphrodite K. Konduros, concur. PLEICONES, J dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent, and would hold that the\r\n  erroneous assumption of the risk charge prejudiced the Coles, and therefore\r\n  would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  Moreover, as explained\r\n  below, in my view the majorityâ€™s discussion of the â€œtwo issue ruleâ€ is\r\n  fundamentally flawed.\r\n I agree with the\r\n  majority of this Court that the trial judge erred in charging the jury on the\r\n  defense of assumption of the risk.Â  In my view, the Coles were prejudiced by\r\n  this charge which instructed the jury that it must return a defense verdict if\r\n  it found â€œthe plaintiff freely and voluntarily exposed herself to a known\r\n  danger and understood and appreciated the dangerâ€ in light of the two â€œinformed\r\n  consentâ€ forms which were introduced into evidence.Â  In my opinion, we need not\r\n  engage in speculation and evidence weighing to determine this charge\r\n  constituted reversible error.\r\nI am also concerned\r\n  because the opinion invokes the two issue rule to affirm this appeal despite\r\n  the ruleâ€™s inapplicability. The two issue rule holds that where a lower courtâ€™s\r\n  general verdict rests on two independent grounds, only one of which is\r\n  challenged on appeal, the appellate court will affirm. The rule is simply one\r\n  expression of the fundamental appellate philosophy of our courts:Â  to affirm\r\n  the decision of the lower court if possible.Â  It also serves a second appellate\r\n  goal, that is, to conserve scarce appellate resources by allowing courts to\r\n  forgo analyzing â€œpointless â€¦ exceptionsâ€ which cannot alter the outcome.Â  Buckner\r\n    v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 171 S.E.2d 544 (1970).Â  These\r\n  policies are reflected in situations other than challenges to a general\r\n  verdict.Â  See e.g. Brading v. County of Georgetown, 327\r\n  S.C. 107, 490 S.E.2d 4 (1997)(failure to argue all grounds for ruling below\r\n  requires affirmance); Buckner, supra (same); S.C. Prop. and\r\n    Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 548 S.E.2d 880 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001)(same).Â  \r\nI agree with the\r\n  majority that the two issue rule is properly applied where a general verdict\r\n  for the plaintiff rests on more than one theory of liability, not all of which\r\n  are challenged on appeal, or where a defense verdict rests on multiple\r\n  theories, at least one of which is not challenged.[4]Â \r\n  Here, we have a defense verdict, but only one liability theory and one defense.Â \r\n  As I understand the majority opinion, it is applying the two issue rule to\r\n  preclude appellate review of a defense verdict where the â€œtwo issuesâ€ are the\r\n  defendantâ€™s challenge to the plaintiffâ€™s proof, and an (admittedly\r\n  inapplicable) affirmative defense.Â  This new rule would mean, for example, that\r\n  in an automobile wreck case where the plaintiff testified the light was green\r\n  and the defendant testified the light was red, neither party could appeal the\r\n  charging of inapposite liability theories or defenses following a general jury\r\n  verdict because a â€œgeneral verdict for [either party] may be sustained because\r\n  it is independently supported by the negligence claim which was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury.â€ I cannot join in the creation of this new rule. \r\nThe\r\n  two issue rule has no application, in my view, where as here there is one\r\n  liability theory (negligence) and the defense theories are â€œnot provenâ€ and\r\n  â€œassumption of the risk.â€Â  That the jury may have returned a defense verdict\r\n  upon a finding that Dr. Raut was not negligent rather than on the erroneous\r\n  assumption of the risk defense should not affect the Colesâ€™ right to an appeal\r\n  and a reversal.Â  Since the appellate court has no basis upon which to determine\r\n  whether the defense verdict rests on the juryâ€™s decision that the Coles failed\r\n  in their proof or upon a finding that Mrs. Cole assumed the risk, in my view,\r\n  the Coles have demonstrated the requisite prejudice entitling them to a new\r\n  trial.Â  The majority, I fear, has unwittingly resurrected the same perversion\r\n  of the â€œtwo issue ruleâ€ that it soundly rejected in Anderson v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 322 S.C. 417, 421, 472 S.E.2d 253,\r\n  255 (1996)(rejecting Court of Appealsâ€™ misapplication of the two issue rule, in\r\n  part â€œbecause [if] the juryâ€™s general verdict could potentially be upheld\r\n  anytime it was susceptible of two or more constructions, there would be no\r\n  incentive for trial courts to correct such errors. . . . â€œ).Â Â  \r\nSince\r\n  I believe the Coles established the requisite prejudice from the improper\r\n  assumption of the risk and since the â€œtwo issue ruleâ€ does not apply, I would\r\n  affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals reversing and remanding the matter\r\n  for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the time of Kyleâ€™s birth, Chester Memorial Hospital contained two operating\r\n  rooms with in-house surgery crews available daily to perform scheduled\r\n  procedures during set hours of operation.Â  Outside of the regular hours of\r\n  operation, a single standby surgical crew remained available on an on-call\r\n  basis in the event that a surgical emergency arose during this time.\r\n[2] This Court effectively abolished the affirmative defense of assumption of the\r\n  risk in Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation, holding that the doctrine\r\n  had been largely subsumed by the law of comparative negligence.Â  333 S.C. 71,\r\n  88, 508 S.E.2d 565, 574 (1998).Â  However, the cause of action in the instant\r\n  case arose prior to Davenport and the validity of the defense in that\r\n  regard is not challenged on appeal. \r\n[3] Neither party disputes that the negligence claim was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury.Â  \r\n[4] Unlike the majority, I do not readÂ  Hussman Refrigerator &amp; Supply Co. v.\r\n  Cash &amp; Carry Grocer, Inc., 134 S.C. 191, 132 S.E.173 (1926) as\r\n  involving the application of the two issue rule, but rather as holding that\r\n  where a party interposes no timely objection, a general verdict for the other\r\n  party disposes of all claims and counterclaims.Â  Huffman is not a case\r\n  where a party failed to challenge on appeal all the grounds upon which the\r\n  juryâ€™s verdict might rest, but rather one where a partyâ€™s failure at trial to\r\n  timely object to the form of the verdict precluded further relief.Â  Anderson\r\n    v. West, 270 S.C. 184, 241 S.E.2d 551 (1978), also cited by the majority,\r\n  actually supports my view that the rule is properly invoked only where the\r\n  appellant fails to challenge all the theories upon which the jury verdict might\r\n  rest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of John A.

Orr, of Orr, Elmore &amp; Ervin, LLC, of Florence, for appellant.\r\n        Desa A.\r\n          Ballard and Stephanie Weissenstein, of Law Offices of Desa Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  MOORE:Â  Annie Melton filed an action\r\n  against respondent, her former attorney, alleging causes of action for negligence,\r\n  conversion, breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent\r\n  act, and constructive trust.Â  Meltonâ€™s attorneys were appellant and J. Leeds\r\n  Barroll.Â  Respondent answered and counterclaimed that the suit was frivolous\r\n  and in violation of Rule 11, SCRCP, and the South Carolina Frivolous\r\n  Proceedings Sanction Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10, et seq. (2005).[1]Â \r\n  Melton filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims.Â  Thereafter, respondent\r\n  filed a motion for summary judgment as to Meltonâ€™s causes of action.\r\nAfter depositions\r\n  were taken, Melton voluntarily filed a stipulation of dismissal of the\r\n  complaint with prejudice.Â  Respondent voluntarily dismissed his counterclaims\r\n  and then filed a motion seeking sanctions against Melton and appellant, but not\r\n  against Barroll. \r\nAfter a hearing,\r\n  the lower court issued an order awarding respondent $27,364.31 against\r\n  appellant for fees and expenses incurred in defending the Melton suit and in\r\n  pursuing sanctions.Â  Appellant appeals this award.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn May\r\n  1999, Jerry Bittle (Bittle) was seriously injured in an automobile accident in\r\n  which one person died and four additional people were injured.Â  Bittle\r\n  sustained a brain injury and is now unable to care for himself.Â  After the\r\n  accident, Bittleâ€™s elderly mother, Melton, retained respondent to represent\r\n  Bittleâ€™s interests in seeking recovery for his injuries.\r\nIn June 2001, an\r\n  agreement was reached on how the available insurance coverage would be\r\n  allocated among the claimants.Â  Bittle was to receive $14,868.97.Â  Within two\r\n  months, Melton and Bittle went to respondentâ€™s office to consummate the\r\n  settlement.Â  Respondent was not present.Â  Bittle endorsed the settlement check\r\n  and respondentâ€™s secretary explained that Bittle would not receive the endorsed\r\n  check but he would receive another check later.\r\nMelton called and\r\n  visited respondentâ€™s office several times to determine when the settlement\r\n  check would be transferred to them; however she was unable to reach him.Â  Melton\r\n  was aware there was not enough money available from the settlement to pay all\r\n  of the medical bills; however, she testified she thought respondent had either\r\n  kept or spent the settlement proceeds.\r\nMelton consulted\r\n  appellant in January 2004.Â  After the above facts were related to appellant, appellant\r\n  contacted the insurance agency for the at-fault party and talked with the\r\n  adjuster who had handled the claim.Â  After obtaining the settlement documents,\r\n  appellant determined the settlement check was presented for payment on August\r\n  24, 2001.Â  Appellant reviewed telephone records that revealed the number of\r\n  times Melton had called respondent.Â  Appellant also knew that Melton had sought\r\n  help from a North Carolina attorney; however, seeking that attorneyâ€™s help did\r\n  not produce any response from respondent.\r\nAppellant informed\r\n  Melton she should file a grievance with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  because he felt that if Melton filed a grievance then it might â€œshake [the\r\n  money] looseâ€ from respondent.Â  Appellant prepared the letter to disciplinary\r\n  counsel for Melton and also prepared a subsequent letter.Â  At this point,\r\n  appellant indicated he was waiting to see what would happen with the grievance\r\n  and that he was hoping respondent would deliver the money; however, he became\r\n  concerned that the statute of limitations on any claim concerning the\r\n  settlement proceeds would run by the end of August 2004.\r\nIn June 2004,\r\n  Melton wrote respondent a letter terminating his services for failure to\r\n  account for the settlement proceeds.Â  She then entered into a retainer\r\n  agreement with appellant so that he would pursue claims for wrongfully holding\r\n  the settlement funds.Â  Appellant was to take one-third of Meltonâ€™s recovery,\r\n  plus any expenses were to come from Meltonâ€™s portion of her recovery.Â \r\n  Appellant associated J. Leeds Barroll as co-counsel in late July 2004.\r\nAfter Barroll and\r\n  appellant discussed the facts of the case, Barroll researched causes of action\r\n  and drafted the complaint.Â  Barroll asked appellant if he thought he should\r\n  contact respondent but appellant did not think it would â€œdo any good.â€Â  Because\r\n  respondent had not responded to Meltonâ€™s requests for information regarding the\r\n  funds, Barroll included the conversion action in the complaint.Â  Barroll\r\n  testified that because the statute of limitations was going to run, he felt\r\n  they were in a â€œshoot first, ask questions laterâ€ mode.Â  Barroll stated\r\n  appellant did not initially tell him that he had been on the case since\r\n  January.\r\nAppellant testified\r\n  that the basis of the claim for conversion against respondent was that\r\n  respondent refused to account for the money.Â  Appellant stated he had no\r\n  knowledge that respondent had actually converted the money.\r\nLeighton Bell, a\r\n  staff writer with the Cheraw Chronicle, learned of Meltonâ€™s suit against\r\n  respondent when the process server personally gave the summons and complaint to\r\n  him.Â  As a result, he wrote two articles regarding the suit.Â  He stated he\r\n  spoke to appellant first and that appellant was not surprised by his call and\r\n  was very helpful with the article.Â  In one article, appellant was quoted as\r\n  saying:Â  â€œAs an attorney [respondent] should have known he couldnâ€™t co-mingle\r\n  funds,â€ and â€œIf for some reason he couldnâ€™t disperse the check he should have\r\n  put it in a separate fund.Â  Whatever [respondent] did, he shouldnâ€™t have kept\r\n  it in his pocket and collected all the interest on it.â€\r\nAfter the action\r\n  began, respondent immediately transferred the settlement proceeds from his\r\n  trust account to appellant. Â Barroll then deposed the Medicaid agent regarding\r\n  Medicaidâ€™s lien on the settlement proceeds.Â  After the deposition, Barroll\r\n  voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice a mere seven weeks after filing.Â \r\n  Barroll stated that if he had been involved in the case since January, as\r\n  appellant had been, he would have had time to interview the Medicaid agent\r\n  prior to filing a lawsuit.Â  Barroll also acknowledged that once he requested\r\n  respondentâ€™s file and reviewed it, he was able to determine that respondent had\r\n  been in touch with Medicaid about reducing its lien against the settlement\r\n  proceeds.Â  Although the contact was minimal, Barroll felt it was a waste of\r\n  time to proceed with the lawsuit.Â  He indicated there was no evidence that\r\n  appellant ever asked for respondentâ€™s file.\r\nAs soon as\r\n  respondent transferred the money to appellant, Barroll began negotiations with\r\n  Medicaid and the medical providers to compromise the liens and bills.Â  The\r\n  Medicaid lien was compromised for $3,469 and the balance of the settlement\r\n  funds, after subtracting $4,956.32 in attorney fees and $1,045.15 in expenses,\r\n  was paid to Melton.Â  Melton received $5,398.50.\r\nRespondent filed\r\n  his motion for sanctions and contended that appellant had no basis for filing a\r\n  claim, and in particular, the conversion claim.Â  Respondent stated in his\r\n  affidavit that he was representing Melton and Bittle for free.Â  He stated he\r\n  discussed with Melton and Bittle how to deal with all of the medical liens and that\r\n  they agreed that they did not want to jeopardize Bittleâ€™s Medicaid\r\n  eligibility.Â  He requested a waiver of the Medicaid lien but was only able to\r\n  obtain an agreement for reduction.Â  He stated, even with the reduction, there\r\n  would be no funds left over for Bittle.\r\nDue to Rule 1.15 of\r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct, respondent stated he was obligated to hold\r\n  the settlement funds until the disputes between the lienholders and his client\r\n  were resolved, a fact he explained to Bittle and Melton.[2]Â \r\n  He informed them he may be able to recover funds for Bittle if he held the\r\n  funds until the statute of limitations had expired on the medical provider\r\n  liens.Â  This method would leave only the Medicaid lien to resolve.Â  He then\r\n  held the funds per their agreement.Â  The C.P.A. who reviewed respondentâ€™s\r\n  account stated the funds never left respondentâ€™s trust account until the check\r\n  was written to appellant.\r\nAppellant testified\r\n  he did not contact respondent because he thought if respondent would not\r\n  respond to his clients or the North Carolina attorney, then he would not\r\n  respond to him.Â  He also felt it was unnecessary to contact respondent because\r\n  he expected Disciplinary Counsel to take care of it.Â  Appellant stated he did\r\n  not get respondentâ€™s file because he did not think he would learn anything from\r\n  it.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  granted respondentâ€™s motion for summary judgment and found there was no dispute\r\n  the funds remained in respondentâ€™s trust account from the time of the\r\n  settlement until the funds were disbursed to appellant.Â  The court concluded\r\n  the cause of action for conversion was frivolous.Â  The court did not issue a\r\n  judgment against Melton because she had relied on the advice of counsel.Â  The\r\n  court found appellant had not conducted a reasonable investigation before\r\n  filing the conversion suit.Â  The court awarded respondent $27,364.31 in\r\n  attorney fees and costs in defending the action and in pursuing the claim for\r\n  sanctions.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nPursuant\r\n  to the South Carolina Constitution, an appellate court reviews findings of fact\r\n  in an equity matter taking its own view of the evidence.Â  Father v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 353 S.C. 254, 578 S.E.2d 11 (2003).Â  However, the\r\n  abuse of discretion standard plays a role in the appellate review of a\r\n  sanctions award.Â  Id.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs where the decision\r\n  is controlled by an error of law or is based on unsupported factual\r\n  conclusions.Â  Id.Â  For example, where the appellate court agrees with\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact, it reviews the decision to award sanctions,\r\n  as well as the terms of those sanctions, under an abuse of discretion\r\n  standard.Â  Id.Â  See also Runyon v. Wright, 322 S.C. 15,\r\n  471 S.E.2d 160 (1996) (the imposition of sanctions will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion by the lower court).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n     Did the circuit court err by\r\n  finding the suit against respondent was frivolous because insufficient\r\ninvestigation had been conducted by appellant?\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the circuit court err by\r\n  awarding attorney fees and expenses which exceeded that provided for in the\r\nFrivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the court erred by finding the suit against respondent was frivolous\r\n  because he had sufficiently investigated the facts and circumstances related to\r\n  him and found that there was a basis for the suit.\r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 11(a), SCRCP, a party and/or the partyâ€™s attorney may be sanctioned for\r\n  filing a frivolous pleading, motion, or other paper, or for making frivolous\r\n  arguments.Â  Runyon v. Wright, 322 S.C. 15, 471 S.E.2d 160 (1996). Â The\r\n  party and/or attorney may also be sanctioned for filing a pleading, motion, or\r\n  other paper in bad faith whether or not there is good ground to support it.Â  Id. Â The sanction may include an order to pay the reasonable costs and\r\n  attorney fees incurred by the party or parties defending against the frivolous\r\n  action or action brought in bad faith, a reasonable fine to be paid to the\r\n  court, or a directive of a nonmonetary nature designed to deter the party or\r\n  the partyâ€™s attorney from bringing any future frivolous action or action in bad\r\n  faith.Â  Id.Â  Further, if appropriate under the facts of the case, the\r\n  court may order a party and/or the partyâ€™s attorney to pay a reasonable\r\n  monetary penalty to the party or parties defending against the frivolous action\r\n  or action brought in bad faith.Â  Id.Â  A court imposing sanctions under Rule 11 should, in its\r\n  order, describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of the Rule\r\n  and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanction Act provides for liability\r\n  for attorney fees and costs of frivolous suits.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-36-10 (2005) provides that any person who takes part in the procurement,\r\n  initiation, and continuation of any civil proceeding is subject to being\r\n  assessed for payment of all or a portion of the attorney fees and court costs of\r\n  the other party if (1) he does so primarily for a purpose other than that of\r\n  securing the proper adjudication of the claim upon which the proceedings are\r\n  based, and (2) the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking\r\n  an assessment of the fees and costs.\r\nSection\r\n  Â§ 15-36-20 provides:\r\n\r\n  Any\r\n    person who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation . . . of\r\n    civil proceedings must be considered to have acted to secure a proper purpose\r\n    as stated in item (1) of Section 15-36-10 if he reasonably believes in the\r\n    existence of the facts upon which his claim is based and \r\n  (1)&nbsp;reasonably believes that under\r\n    those facts his claim may be valid under the existing or developing law; or \r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n  (3) \r\n    believes, as an attorney of record, in good faith that his procurement,\r\n    initiation, continuation, or defense of a civil cause is not intended to merely\r\n    harass or injure the other party.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  court correctly found that, had appellant conducted a reasonable investigation,\r\n  he would have known there was no basis for the conversion action.Â  We find it\r\n  troubling that appellant was willing to speak with a news reporter and make\r\n  statements that he would have known to be false if he had conducted any type of\r\n  meaningful investigation.Â  Without a reasonable basis, appellant relied on his\r\n  clientâ€™s statements that she did not know where the settlement money was to\r\n  make inflammatory statements to the newspaper, i.e. accusing respondent\r\n  of commingling funds and of keeping the settlement money â€œin his pocketâ€ and\r\n  collecting all the interest on it.\r\nThere\r\n  was evidence appellant had time to investigate whether respondent had contacted\r\n  Medicaid and that he could have realized much sooner that respondent was not\r\n  engaging in any wrongful conduct by holding the settlement money.Â  In fact, the\r\n  associated attorney, Barroll, had suggested to appellant that he contact\r\n  respondent, but appellant refused.Â  Had appellant spoken with respondent and\r\n  relayed Meltonâ€™s worries over the money, then the suit would have never been\r\n  filed.Â  Under the particular facts of this case, a simple phone call may have\r\n  led to an explanation by respondent as to why the money was being held.Â  Such a\r\n  discussion between the attorneys could have prevented the grievance and suit\r\n  from being filed against respondent.\r\nWe\r\n  find that while an attorney or a pro se litigant does not have a duty to\r\n  consult with a potential defendant prior to filing suit, before alleging conversion\r\n  against an attorney for misappropriation of client funds or legal malpractice,\r\n  a reasonable investigation is necessary.[3]\r\nThe\r\n  above facts support the lower courtâ€™s conclusions that appellant failed to\r\n  properly investigate the matter prior to filing it, and that the action was\r\n  frivolous.Â  See Father v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., supra (a party who makes a frivolous claim has committed a more egregious act than\r\n  one who merely acts without substantial justification).Â  Accordingly, the court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion by awarding sanctions against appellant.Â  See id. (abuse of discretion occurs where decision is controlled by error of law or is\r\n  based on unsupported factual conclusions).\r\nII\r\nThe trial\r\n  court found appellant had made a frivolous claim and levied a sanction of $27,364.31\r\n  in attorney fees and costs in defending the action and in pursuing the claim\r\n  for sanctions.Â  Appellant argues the court erred by awarding attorney fees and\r\n  costs that were incurred in pursuing the claim for sanctions.Â  Appellant argues\r\n  that this portion of the award is not intended by the Frivolous Proceedings Act.\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-50 (2005) of the Frivolous Proceedings Act states\r\n  that, â€œ[u]pon a finding that a person has violated the provisions of this\r\n  chapter, the court shall determine the appropriate fees and costs and enter\r\n  judgment accordingly.â€Â  Therefore, Â§ 15-36-50 clearly allows respondent to\r\n  recover the fees and costs that were incurred in seeking sanctions pursuant to\r\n  the Act.Â  Further, we find the language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-30 (2005),\r\n  which entitles a person to recover attorney fees and court costs reasonably\r\n  incurred in litigating the proceedings, also entitles respondent to recover the\r\n  fees and costs he incurred in seeking sanctions.Â  The language, â€œreasonably\r\n  incurred in litigating the proceedings,â€ contemplates the fees and costs that\r\n  represent the underlying proceedings wherein respondent sought to recover the\r\n  fees and costs he had to pay to defend the suit against him and the proceedings\r\n  wherein respondent sought sanctions for the underlying frivolous suit.Â  In\r\n  conclusion, the trial court appropriately awarded attorney fees and costs to\r\n  respondent to represent the amount he incurred in seeking the sanctions.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the lower\r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the result\r\n  reached by the majority but am troubled by the imposition of a new duty forcing\r\n  an attorney to conduct a â€œreasonableâ€ investigation so as to comply with Â§\r\n  15-36-20.Â  In my opinion, this new responsibility places upon an attorney an\r\n  additional requirement not currently required by statute.Â  I would not create a\r\n  blanket rule that precludes an attorney from obtaining a reasonable belief in\r\n  the merits of a case based solely on information related to him by a client.\r\nI agree that, based\r\n  on the facts of this case, appellant filed the action primarily for a purpose\r\n  other than securing the proper adjudication of the claim upon which the\r\n  proceedings were based.Â  I would affirm the lower court but see no need to\r\n  impose additional duties on an attorney beyond that which is required by\r\n  statute.\r\n\r\n[1]Section\r\n  15-36-10 was rewritten and Â§ 15-36-20 to Â§ 15-36-50 were repealed in 2005.Â  The\r\n  new Â§ 15-36-10 was effective July 1, 2005, and is applicable to causes of\r\n  action arising on or after that date.Â  The instant cause of action arose before\r\nJuly 1, 2005; therefore, the previous statutes are applicable in this case.\r\n[2]Rule 1.15(d) provides:Â  â€œUpon receiving funds . . . in which a\r\n  client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the\r\n  client or third person.Â  Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted\r\n  by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the\r\n  client or third person any funds . . . that the client or third person is\r\n  entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third person, shall\r\npromptly render a full accounting regarding such property.â€Â  \r\nRule 1.15(e)\r\n  provides:Â  â€œWhen in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of\r\n  property in which two or more persons . . . claim\r\n  interests, the property shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute\r\n  is resolved. The lawyer shall promptly distribute all portions of the property\r\nas to which the interests are not in dispute.â€\r\n[3]The\r\n  concurrence indicates that we have imposed an additional duty upon an attorney\r\n  by creating a blanket rule that an attorney is precluded from obtaining a\r\n  reasonable belief in the merits of a case based solely on information related\r\n  to him by a client.Â  However, we have not created such a blanket rule.Â  Our\r\n  conclusion that an attorney must conduct a reasonable investigation beyond what\r\n  is related to the attorney by his client is limited to the situation where a\r\n  client is alleging conversion against his or her former attorney for\r\nmisappropriation of client funds or legal malpractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26505","title":"Seago v.

a map of a specific region or local has to be â€œcreatedâ€ by\r\n  running the requested flat file information through the database to produce the\r\n  requested map.Â  According to Timothy Oliver, Assistant Director of the GIS department,\r\n  this process is unique to Horry County and requires creativity and judgment on\r\n  the part of the GIS department to know how to combine the different flat files\r\n  to create an integrated, aerial-photographed map that precisely identifies the\r\n  location of parcels, bodies of water, streets, buildings, hydrology, and\r\n  topography.Â  \r\n Horry County developed its digital database system at a cost of $7.5 million dollars.Â \r\n  Because of the constantly changing information regarding property in the\r\n  County, it costs nearly $1 million each year to update the information in the\r\n  flat files.Â  To protect its investment and the integrity of the data from\r\n  manipulation or alteration by subsequent users, Horry County applied for\r\n  copyrights for its planimetric layers data and orthophoto Mr. Sid data.[3]Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 5, 2001, Seago made a FOIA request for a copy of the â€œOrthophoto\r\n  Coverage in Mr. Sid format (Countywide)â€ so he could place the digital\r\n  photographic map on his website for use by his customers.Â  In January 2002,\r\n  Lisa Bourcier, Director of Public Information for Horry County, informed Seago\r\n  that he could obtain a copy of the information for a fee of $100, but he would\r\n  have to sign a licensing agreement acknowledging Horry Countyâ€™s copyright on\r\n  the information and restricting any further commercial use without prior\r\n  written consent.Â  Seago did not object to the fee, but he refused to sign the\r\n  licensing agreement.Â  Seago did not obtain the requested information.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 29, 2002, Seago again made a FOIA request for full-county coverage GIS\r\n  data for planimetric layers, topographic layers, and parcel layers in ArcInfo\r\n  Shapefile or ArcInfo export formats.Â  Seago included a check for $125, which he\r\n  had previously been informed was the charge for the data, and his request\r\n  specifically noted that he would only sign a licensing agreement if Horry County could show authority to copyright public information.Â  On September 20, 2002,\r\n  Bourcier returned Seagoâ€™s check and informed him that Horry County could not process his request at that time because the requested information contained\r\n  â€œcopyrightable elements,â€ and Horry County had retained copyright attorneys to\r\n  research and copyright what was appropriate.Â  On October 1, 2002, the Horry\r\n  County Council held their first reading of a proposed ordinance to require a\r\n  special fee schedule and a licensing agreement for the distribution of GIS\r\n  information.Â  Seago continued to receive letters from Bourcier, alternately\r\n  informing him:Â  (1) that his request could not be processed at that time; (2)\r\n  that his request was for copyrightable information; (3) that the requested\r\n  information was not subject to FOIA because the county possessed no document\r\n  that â€œprovides the complex information you seekâ€ and it would have to be\r\n  created; and (4) that Horry County was attempting to pass the fee and licensing\r\n  ordinance.Â  After Seago initiated the underlying lawsuit for a FOIA violation,\r\n  Bourcier wrote him a letter pointing out Seagoâ€™s misunderstanding that he was\r\n  being denied access and stating Seagoâ€™s FOIA requests would have been granted\r\n  if only he had signed the licensing agreement.Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™\r\n  lawsuit sought a declaratory judgment that:Â  Horry Countyâ€™s charges for copies\r\n  exceeded the actual cost of making copies; the restrictions on the use of the\r\n  documents by the County was an ultra vires act; and there is no FOIA\r\n  exception for records containing copyrightable elements.Â  Horry County counterclaimed for copyright infringement and later removed the matter to federal\r\n  court.Â  After the parties argued the case in front of the federal magistrate,\r\n  the district court adopted the magistrateâ€™s recommendation that the case was\r\n  strictly an application of state FOIA law and dismissed the matter.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  state court, the parties agreed to refer the matter to the master-in-equity,\r\n  and Horry County later dismissed its counterclaims.Â  In an amended order, the\r\n  master determined:Â  (1) the requested information constituted a public record\r\n  subject to disclosure under FOIA because the definition of â€œpublic recordâ€ is\r\n  broad enough to include the documentary materials that the flat file records\r\n  could be exported into; (2) Horry County could copyright its materials, and the\r\n  copyright protections could be read harmoniously with FOIA, because the right\r\n  to access public documents is separate and distinct from any right to\r\n  subsequent distribution; (3) FOIA is satisfied once access is granted to the\r\n  information; and (4) Horry County could impose a licensing fee in excess of the\r\n  cost of reproducing the data â€œwhere, as under the circumstances of this case,\r\n  the data is being released for purposes that extend beyond initial access to a\r\n  public record as allowed by FOIA,â€ and in light of Seagoâ€™s testimony that he\r\n  had no objection to the fees being charged to him.Â Â Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA\r\n  declaratory judgment action under the FOIA to determine whether certain\r\n  information should be disclosed is an action at law.â€Â  Campbell v.\r\n    Marion County Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274, 280, 580 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App.\r\n  2003) (citing S.C. Tax Commâ€™n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 316 S.C.\r\n  163, 447 S.E.2d 843 (1994)).Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, this\r\n  Court reviews the lower court only to correct errors of law.Â  Crary v.\r\n    Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 388, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998).Â  The trial courtâ€™s\r\n  factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is no evidence in\r\n  the record that would reasonably support the findings.Â  Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 621, 533 S.E.2d 886, 893 (2000).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION[4]\r\nI.Â  Restrictions on subsequent use under FOIA\r\nAppellants argue the master erred in finding Horry County could restrict subsequent distribution of public records because:Â  (1) FOIA\r\n  does not include an exception for disclosure for records containing â€œcopyrightable\r\n  elements;â€ and (2) FOIA does not authorize restrictions on subsequent use.Â  \r\nThe purpose of FOIA is to protect citizens from secret\r\n  government activity.Â  Campbell, 354 S.C. at 280, 580 S.E.2d at 166.Â \r\n  FOIA allows the public to â€œlearn and report fully the activities of their\r\n  public officials at a minimum cost or delayâ€ by providing the public access to\r\n  public documents[5] or meetings.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-15 (2007).Â  Pursuant to FOIA, any person\r\n  has the right to copy public records, unless an exception applies, at a fee\r\n  â€œnot to exceed the actual cost of searching for or making copies of records.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30(a), (b) (2007).Â  Any government agency attempting to\r\n  avail itself of an exemption bears the burden of proving the exemption applies.Â  Evening Post Publâ€™g Co. v. City of North Charleston, 363 S.C. 452, 457,\r\n  611 S.E.2d 496, 499 (2005).Â  The exemptions to FOIA should be narrowly\r\n  construed to ensure public access to documents.Â  Id.Â  \r\nFOIA grants the public an immutable right to access public\r\n  records.Â  However, this right of access is viewed differently where commercial\r\n  use of public information is concerned.Â  FOIA specifically limits the\r\n  subsequent commercial use of information obtained pursuant to the Act in some\r\n  situations:Â  (1) public records containing the telephone number, address, and\r\n  name of handicapped persons may not be disclosed where the information is to be\r\n  used for person-to-person commercial solicitation of such handicapped person;\r\n  and (2) information contained in a police incident report, or in an employee\r\n  salary schedule, or the home addresses and phone numbers of employees and\r\n  officers of public bodies may not be used for commercial solicitation.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(2) (2007) (providing the government may exempt from\r\n  disclosure contact information for handicapped persons if it is to be used for\r\n  commercial solicitation); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-50(B) (2007) (prohibiting the\r\n  use of information in a police report, employee salary schedule, or the home\r\n  addresses of public body employees and officers for commercial solicitation).Â  \r\nWhile it is true that copyright-protected data is not listed as an\r\n  exemption to FOIA disclosure, Horry County does not deny this fact and there is\r\n  evidence in the record to support the masterâ€™s finding that Horry County was not attempting to restrict initial access to the material by Appellants.Â \r\n  Thus, the question before the Court is whether Horry County may restrict the subsequent\r\n    commercial distribution of public information pursuant to the copyright\r\n  law.Â  \r\nIn deciding this question, the master relied upon the federal case\r\n  of County of Suffolk, New York v. First American Real Estate\r\n    Solutions, 261 F.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2001).Â  In Suffolk, Suffolk County sued First American for copyright infringement for copying and selling Suffolk Countyâ€™s copyrighted tax maps.Â  The Suffolk court found that states and\r\n  political subdivisions may obtain copyrights, and maps could be\r\n  copyright-protected to the extent it could be shown that it contained original\r\n  material, research, and creative compilation.Â  Suffolk, 261 F.3d at\r\n  187-88.Â  The court next considered whether the New York Freedom of Information\r\n  Law (FOIL) abrogated Suffolk Countyâ€™s copyright.Â  Noting that when FOIL was\r\n  enacted it was recognized that states could possess copyrights, the court found\r\n  it significant that FOIL was silent as to the effect of requiring disclosure on\r\n  preexisting copyrights the agency possessed and what may occur after the agency\r\n  discloses the records.Â  Id. at 189.Â  The court found the extent of the\r\n  state agencyâ€™s FOIL obligation is to make its records available for public\r\n  inspection and copying, stating that it â€œis one thing to read this provision to\r\n  permit a member of the public to copy a public record, but it is quite another\r\n  to read into it the right of a private entity to distribute commercially what\r\n  it would otherwise, under copyright law, be unable to distribute.â€Â  Id.[6] Â \r\nBecause FOIA does not prohibit the copyrighting of some\r\n  specialized public information, we agree with the Suffolk courtâ€™s\r\n  reasoning that the county may obtain copyrights, and maps can be\r\n  copyright-protected to the extent it can be shown that it contains original\r\n  material, research, and creative compilation.Â  Suffolk, 261 F.3d at\r\n  187-88.Â  The originality and creativity necessary to create and maintain the\r\n  system is present in this case.Â  Further, the purpose of FOIA is satisfied once\r\n  the public information is provided.Â  It does not violate FOIA for a public\r\n  entity to copyright specially-created digital data and to restrict subsequent commercial use as long as the information is provided initially to the requesting person\r\n  or entity.Â  If an entity is allowed to copyright the specially-created data, it\r\n  is logical that the governmental entity should be allowed to enact ordinances\r\n  to restrict further commercial dissemination of the information in order to\r\n  protect the copyright.Â  See 17 U.S.C.A. Â§ 106 (2005) (providing that\r\n  copyright holders have the exclusive right to allow certain uses, and thus\r\n  impose subsequent use restrictions).Â Â  \r\nHowever, Appellants point to the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Campbell\r\n  v. Marion County Hospital District, 354 S.C. 274, 580 S.E.2d 163 (Ct. App. 2003), to support their argument that FOIA prohibits any subsequent use\r\n  restriction on public information.Â  In Campbell, the circuit court ruled\r\n  that Dr. Campbell could get access to the county hospitalâ€™s records of physician\r\n  recruitment, physiciansâ€™ salaries, and purchase prices of practices pursuant to\r\n  FOIA, but the circuit court ruled such information constituted â€œtrade secretsâ€\r\n  such that the court restricted Dr. Campbell from subsequently disclosing the\r\n  information to third parties.Â  Campbell, 354 S.C. at 278-79, 580 S.E.2d\r\n  165.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit courtâ€™s protective order,\r\n  finding the information did not constitute â€œtrade secretsâ€ and that information\r\n  obtained pursuant to FOIA could not be protected by a restraining order.Â  Id. at 287, 580 S.E.2d at 169.Â  While the Campbell opinion correctly noted\r\n  that FOIA does not provide for the prohibition on further dissemination of\r\n  information obtained, the case did not deal with the interplay of federal\r\n  copyright restrictions and licensing on subsequent commercial dissemination of\r\n  the information.Â  Thus, Campbell is not applicable to the underlying\r\n  case.Â  Â Â \r\nAccordingly, we agree with the master that FOIA and copyright law\r\n  can be â€œread harmoniouslyâ€ and that the Horry County ordinance allowing the\r\n  licensing restrictions on further commercial dissemination of the GIS data does\r\n  not violate FOIA.Â  The ability to copyright specially-created data, as long as\r\n  the public is given access to the public data, does not frustrate the purpose\r\n  of FOIA.\r\nII. Jurisdiction\r\n  to determine copyright claim\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the master was without jurisdiction to make any findings of fact\r\n  regarding copyrights because it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of federal\r\n  courts.Â  \r\nFederal\r\n  district courts have original jurisdiction to hear any civil actions â€œarising\r\n  underâ€ any Act of Congress relating to copyrights.Â  28 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1338(a)\r\n  (1999).Â  The mere fact that a case concerns a copyright does not necessarily\r\n  mean the case comes within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.Â  Enhanced\r\n    Computer Solutions, Inc. v. Rose, 927 F.Supp. 738, 739 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).Â  An\r\n  action arises under the federal copyright law where the complaint seeks a\r\n  remedy specifically granted by the Copyright Act or requires construction of\r\n  the Act.Â  Merchant v. Levy, 92 F.3d 51, 55 (2d Cir. 1996).Â  â€œMany\r\n  disputes over copyright ownership will arise under state law and involve no\r\n  federal questions.â€Â  Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. City of Richmond, 895\r\n  F.2d 967, 969 (4th Cir. 1990).\r\nIn the\r\n  underlying case, Horry County counterclaimed for copyright infringement, sought\r\n  damages, and removed the case to federal court.Â  At the argument before the\r\n  district court magistrate, Appellants asserted they were not challenging Horry Countyâ€™s ability to own a copyright, but they were instead challenging the ability to\r\n  assert copyright protection to circumvent FOIA.Â  Appellants argued that the\r\n  case was not a matter of whether a copyright existed, but it was rather a\r\n  matter of exclusive state law concerning whether Horry County could withhold\r\n  public information.Â  Appellants later argued that whether Horry County has the authority to obtain a copyright is a question of state law and the extent of\r\n  such copyright is a federal question.Â  The district court adopted the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s recommendation that the case be remanded to state court because\r\n  the case did not involve the â€œvalidity, scope, or infringement of a copyright\r\n  claimâ€ and the case related specifically to state law requests pursuant to\r\n  FOIA.Â Â Â Â  \r\nDespite\r\n  moving to remand the matter to state court, arguing before the magistrate that\r\n  they were not challenging the ability of Horry County to obtain a copyright,\r\n  and failing to appeal the district courtâ€™s finding that the case did not\r\n  involve the validity of a copyright, Appellants now argue the master was\r\n  without jurisdiction to find Horry County had a copyright and was entitled to\r\n  protect its interests.Â  In light of Appellantsâ€™ previous concession, the fact\r\n  that the case concerned matters of interpreting state FOIA law, and the fact\r\n  that the case did not concern a challenge under the Copyright Act, we find the\r\n  master had jurisdiction to make a finding that a copyright existed.Â  The\r\n  Appellantâ€™s argument is wholly without merit.\r\nIII. Licensing\r\n  fee\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the master erred in finding the licensing fees charged by Horry County\r\n  did not violate FOIA because:Â  (1) the fees exceed the actual costs for making\r\n  copies; and (2) the fees are not charged uniformly for the same records.Â  \r\nFOIA\r\n  provides that a â€œpublic body may establish and collect fees not to exceed the\r\n  actual cost of searching for or making copies of records,â€ and the fees must be\r\n  uniform for copies of the same record or document.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30(b)\r\n  (2007).Â  â€œThe records must be furnished at the lowest possible cost to the\r\n  person requesting the records.â€Â  Id.Â  However, the public body may\r\n  decide not to charge a fee where it determines the waiver of the fee is in the\r\n  public interest because â€œfurnishing the information can be considered as\r\n  primarily benefitting the general public.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Horry County ordinance provides different licensing fees for copying GIS data, depending on\r\n  the intended use.Â  Timothy Oliver, Assistant Director of Horry Countyâ€™s GIS department, testified before the master that Horry County provides GIS data to\r\n  certain public entities at no cost, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife\r\n  Service, the City of North Myrtle Beach, and Ocean and Coastal Resource\r\n  Management.Â  Oliver also testified that while the money charged for the record\r\n  may exceed the actual cost of copying it, the cost is associated with the copyright\r\n  license use and not the FOIA request.Â  Horry County places the license fees\r\n  collected in one account for use in maintaining the system and had collected\r\n  nearly $30,000 from 2003 until the September 2005 hearing.Â  Seago testified at\r\n  the hearing that he had no objection to the fees charged, tendering checks in\r\n  the amounts of $100 and $125, and his only complaint was the attempt to\r\n  restrict subsequent commercial use of the information.Â Â  \r\nNoting\r\n  that Seago did not object to the fees being charged to him, the master found\r\n  the County could impose a licensing fee in excess of actual cost of\r\n  reproduction â€œwhere, as under the circumstances of this case, the data is being\r\n  released for purposes that extend beyond initial access to a public record as\r\n  allowed by FOIA.â€Â Â Â  \r\nFirst, we\r\n  find no FOIA violation where Horry County waives fees to public entities.Â  The\r\n  FOIA statute specifically provides that copying fees can be waived where it is\r\n  in the interest of the public.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30(b) (2007).Â  Providing\r\n  these documents for free to public entities that intend to use them for public\r\n  benefit and not for commercial gain would certainly fit under this category.Â  \r\nThe question of whether Horry County can charge â€œlicensing feesâ€\r\n  that would exceed the actual copying costs pursuant to a FOIA request is a more\r\n  difficult question.Â  FOIA requires the actual copying fees be charged at the\r\n  lowest possible cost to the requesting party.Â  Horry County avers that the\r\n  county did not charge Appellants for documents requested pursuant to the FOIA,\r\n  the charge was for the license to commercially distribute the copyrighted data.\r\n  Appellants argue classifying the fee schedule as a â€œlicensing feeâ€ instead of a\r\n  copying fee is merely a matter of semantics where the fee is for the production\r\n  of a public document.Â  Appellants are technically correct that Horry County never provided the documents/data to Appellants in the first place, as is\r\n  required under FOIA.Â  However, after they tendered the requested fee, Horry County informed Appellants that signing the licensing agreement was a prerequisite to\r\n  the production of the data.Â  Thus, it is clear that the fee was not for the production\r\n  of the document; it was for the subsequent commercial distribution of the\r\n  document.Â  \r\nFOIA limitations on the fee structure for providing copies of\r\n  public records are applicable only to those copies that are provided in keeping\r\n  with the spirit of FOIA.Â  FOIA fee provisions do not contemplate subsequent\r\n  commercial distribution of copyright-protected documents for profit.\r\nFOIA is unambiguous in setting forth the method of determining\r\n  fees for providing copies contemplated by the Act.Â  This method does not change\r\n  depending on the status of the requester.Â  However, FOIA does not control fees\r\n  for subsequent commercial distribution for profit of copyrighted public\r\n  records.\r\nThe undisputed evidence in the record is that the licensing fees\r\n  charged for the GIS data exceeded actual copying costs.Â  However, no evidence\r\n  was introduced as to what those actual copying costs would be in non-licensing situations.Â \r\n  The fees in this case, while in excess of actual copying costs, do not appear\r\n  to be exorbitant.Â  Without knowing the actual costs of producing a copy of the\r\n  GIS data, we cannot determine whether the fees charged frustrate the intent of\r\n  FOIA in light of the intended commercial use and Horry Countyâ€™s desire to\r\n  protect its copyright.Â  Accordingly, we find it is more appropriate to remand\r\n  the fee question for the determination of what the actual copying costs would be\r\n  and whether the fees charged were so out of line with the actual copying costs such\r\n  that the fees would frustrate the intent of FOIA. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHorry County is not prohibited from obtaining copyrights on the Countyâ€™s GIS data which was\r\n  specially-created; Horry County could use its copyright to protect the GIS data\r\n  from subsequent commercial use without violating FOIA.Â  Although Horry County could use its copyright to protect the GIS data from subsequent commercial\r\n  distribution for profit, it may not refuse to honor the initial FOIA request.Â  Further,\r\n  the master had jurisdiction to determine the effect of Horry Countyâ€™s copyright on the FOIA action.Â  The question of whether the fees charged violate FOIA\r\n  cannot be determined by the record before us because there is no evidence\r\n  regarding what the actual copying costs would be.Â  Without this information, we\r\n  cannot determine whether the fees frustrate the purpose of FOIA.Â  We remand the\r\n  matter to the lower court for a determination of the amount of the fees,\r\n  whether the fees charged were so out of line with the actual cost as to\r\n  frustrate FOIA, and whether charging different fees based on the identity of\r\n  the requester amounted to a violation.Â  Â \r\nMOORE,\r\n  Acting Chief Justice, WALLER, J., and Acting Justices E. C. Burnett, III and\r\n  James R. Barber, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  â€œFlat fileâ€ data is a computer file spreadsheet that only contains numbers and\r\ninformation.Â  It is not in the format of a map.Â  \r\n[2]Â \r\n  â€œPlanimetricâ€ data includes things such as building footprints, rivers, bodies\r\nof water, hydrology, and streets.Â Â Â  \r\n[3]Â  The record indicates the copyrighted works were\r\n  â€œpublishedâ€ in January 1999 but not registered until February 2003.Â  It appears\r\n  from the record that the copyrights retroactively applied to the works\r\n  originally produced in January 1999.Â  In any event, Appellants do not challenge\r\n  Horry Countyâ€™s ability to obtain a copyright; they challenge the effect of\r\n  the copyright on their FOIA claim and the lower courtâ€™s ability to interpret\r\nthe copyright law.Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n[4]Â \r\n  Appellants raise five issues, including a catch-all issue complaining about all\r\n  the masterâ€™s factual findings.Â  For the sake of clarity, we have combined them\r\ninto three.Â  \r\n[5]Â  Horry County does not challenge the masterâ€™s finding that the GIS\r\n  data, no matter what format it was in, constituted a â€œpublic recordâ€ subject to\r\nFOIA.\r\n[6]Â \r\n  We note there is a similar case from Florida in which the Florida state court\r\n  distinguished Suffolk and held exactly the opposite.Â  Microdecisions,\r\n    Inc., v.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, C. Tex Davis, Jr., Senior\r\n          Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia; for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Irby E. Walker, Jr., of Conway; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  This is an attorney disciplinary matter\r\n  involving a Complaint against William Gary White, III (Respondent) for his\r\n  representation of a client in a personal injury case.Â  After a full\r\n  investigation by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), the Commission on\r\n  Lawyer Conduct filed formal charges against Respondent.Â  After a hearing before\r\n  the Commission on Lawyer Conduct Panel (Panel), the hearing panel recommended\r\n  Respondent be sanctioned to a ninety-day definite suspension from the practice\r\n  of law and be required to pay the costs of the proceedings.Â  Due to the gravity\r\n  of Respondentâ€™s misconduct, we believe a harsher sanction is warranted.Â  After\r\n  we issued our original opinion suspending Respondent for six months and ordering\r\n  him to pay the costs of the proceedings, Disciplinary Counsel petitioned for\r\n  rehearing.Â  We deny the petition for rehearing, withdraw our original opinion\r\n  in this matter, and substitute it with this opinion which corrects a single\r\n  factual statement that Respondent gave testimony to Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  pursuant to a Notice to Appear and Subpoena rather than appearing as the â€œsole\r\n  witness for a hearing conducted by disciplinary counsel before an investigative\r\n  panel.â€\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  October 5, 2004, Client was involved in an automobile accident in which she\r\n  sustained injuries.Â  Three days later, Client sought to retain Respondent to\r\n  represent her to recover for her injuries and property damage.Â  During the\r\n  initial meeting, Client signed a retainer agreement which stated in part, â€œI\r\n  authorize my attorney to receive settlement checks on my behalf, endorse my\r\n  name and deposit same for distribution.â€ \r\nIn the latter part\r\n  of July 2005, Respondent negotiated a settlement with GEICO in the amount of\r\n  $5,500.Â  In a letter dated August 3, 2005, GEICO submitted a Release to\r\n  Respondent and referenced a settlement check.Â  According to the letter, the\r\n  settlement check dated August 3, 2005, had been sent under a separate cover. Â The\r\n  letter instructed Respondent to hold all funds in escrow until Respondentsâ€™\r\n  clients had signed and returned the Release to GEICO.Â  The Release and\r\n  settlement check were to be signed by Client and her husband.Â  Clientâ€™s husband\r\n  was not represented by Respondent and had never accompanied his wife to any of\r\n  her meetings with Respondent.Â Â  Upon receipt of the check, Respondent endorsed\r\n  it by signing his name, Clientâ€™s name, and her husbandâ€™s name.Â  Respondent\r\n  deposited the check into his trust account and then disbursed his legal fees\r\n  from the settlement proceeds and transferred the amount into his operating\r\n  account.Â  \r\nOn August 22, 2005,\r\n  Client met with Respondent who informed her that the case was closed and there\r\n  was nothing else that could be done despite Clientâ€™s complaints that she was\r\n  still in pain and receiving medical treatment. Client expressed dissatisfaction\r\n  with the settlement and ceased any further contact with Respondent.Â  In\r\n  December 2005, Respondentâ€™s office contacted Client in a failed attempt to get\r\n  Client to pick up her settlement check. \r\n In May 2006, Client\r\n  retained another attorney (Attorney) to represent her in a legal malpractice\r\n  action against Respondent and to further pursue her personal injury claim.Â \r\n  During Attorneyâ€™s investigation of the personal injury case, she discovered\r\n  from GEICO that a Release had not been signed.Â Â Â  Because Respondent had\r\n  retained the settlement proceeds, Attorney corresponded in writing with him\r\n  requesting that he return the proceeds to GEICO in order that she could settle\r\n  Clientâ€™s case.Â  In his responses, Respondent claimed that Client had authorized\r\n  him to settle the case and he was not required to return the funds.Â  Respondent\r\n  also challenged Attorneyâ€™s allegation that Client had an additional claim and\r\n  implied that such a claim would be fraudulent. \r\nUltimately,\r\n  Respondent returned the settlement proceeds to GEICO less his fee of $1,879.75.Â \r\n  Following the return of the funds, Attorney negotiated a settlement of $15,000\r\n  from GEICO less the fees retained by Respondent.Â  Attorney also settled with\r\n  State Farm, Clientâ€™s insurance carrier, for $50,000, which represented her\r\n  underinsured coverage.Â  This settlement took into account the medical bills\r\n  that Client acquired after she terminated her representation with Respondent,\r\n  which included a rotator cuff surgery in September 2005 for an injury\r\n  attributed to the October 2004 automobile accident.Â  \r\nDue\r\n  to Respondentâ€™s conduct, Client filed a Complaint against Respondent with the\r\n  ODC.Â  On May 25, 2006, ODC notified Respondent regarding the investigation of Clientâ€™s\r\n  Complaint.Â  Respondent filed a response to the notice on June 22, 2006.Â  On\r\n  November 30, 2006, Respondent gave testimony to Disciplinary Counsel pursuant\r\n  to a Notice to Appear and Subpoena.\r\nBased\r\n  on its investigation, the investigative panel authorized formal charges against\r\n  Respondent.Â  The ODC filed formal charges against Respondent on March 22,\r\n  2007.Â  In his Response to the charges, Respondent admitted he:Â  (1) had\r\n  negotiated the settlement on behalf of Client; and (2) endorsed the settlement\r\n  check with his name and Clientâ€™s name.Â  Because he believed that Client had\r\n  authorized him to settle her case, he denied any misconduct.Â  Although he\r\n  neither admitted nor denied signing Clientâ€™s husbandâ€™s name, he admitted that\r\n  he deposited the settlement check in his trust account and transferred the\r\n  amount of his legal fees into his operating account.Â  He further admitted that\r\n  at the time of the disbursement of the legal fees Client had not signed any\r\n  type of settlement or disbursement sheet.\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing before the Panel, the following witnesses were presented:Â  Client, Clientâ€™s\r\n  husband, Attorney, and another witness (Witness A)[1] who recounted Respondentâ€™s actions.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  gave a different account of his representation of Client.Â  Respondent, a sole\r\n  practitioner, testified he had practiced law for thirty-one years during which\r\n  time he had handled personal injury cases. Â In terms of representing Client,\r\n  Respondent testified he felt Client was â€œanxious to settleâ€ given she\r\n  frequently called his office to inquire about a settlement.Â Â  Because he\r\n  believed that Client was released from medical treatment on July 8, 2005[2],\r\n  he pursued a settlement with GEICO in the latter part of July 2005.Â  According\r\n  to Respondent, Client authorized him to settle her case for $6,000.Â Â \r\n  Respondent claimed he entered into an agreement with GEICO to settle the case\r\n  after several failed attempts to consult with Client regarding a settlement.Â \r\n  He further stated that in all of his years of practice he had never settled a\r\n  claim without his clientâ€™s permission. \r\nRespondent\r\n  admitted that after receiving the settlement check from GEICO he signed Clientâ€™s\r\n  name to the check.Â  Although he could not specifically recall signing Clientâ€™s\r\n  husbandâ€™s name to the check, he testified that if he signed the check it was\r\n  done without a fraudulent intent. Respondent further admitted he deposited the\r\n  settlement check in his trust account and transferred the amount of his legal\r\n  fees into his operating account.Â  Respondent believed this conduct was\r\n  permissible and not in violation of GEICOâ€™s instructions because he received\r\n  the settlement check prior to receiving GEICOâ€™s letter.Â  Respondent further\r\n  testified he did not believe any of his conduct, while representing Client, was\r\n  unethical.\r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Respondent admitted he sent a medical release to Clientâ€™s\r\n  orthopedist on August 22, 2005, in which he requested Clientâ€™s medical records\r\n  from August 1, 2005.Â  Respondent was unable to explain why he made this request\r\n  after he entered into a settlement agreement with GEICO in July 2005.Â Â Â   In\r\n  terms of endorsing the settlement check, Respondent conceded that he was not\r\n  authorized to sign for Clientâ€™s husband; however, he claimed he did so because\r\n  he was concerned about losing the check before it was properly endorsed.Â  \r\nAfter the hearing,\r\n  the Panel found Respondent engaged in misconduct in violation of the following\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct,Â  Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule 1.1, RPC (Competence);\r\n  Rule 1.2, RPC (Scope of Representation; Allocation of Authority between Client\r\n  and Lawyer); Rule 1.4, RPC (Communication); Rule 1.5 (Fees); Rule 1.15, RPC\r\n  (Safekeeping Clientâ€™s Property); and Rules 8.4(d) and (e), RPC (Misconduct).Â \r\n  The Panel recommended that Respondent be suspended for a period of ninety days\r\n  and pay the costs of the proceedings. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAlthough\r\n  Respondent raises eleven exceptions to the Panelâ€™s report, we believe\r\n  Respondent is essentially challenging the Panelâ€™s:Â  (1) factual findings; (2)\r\n  decision regarding the exclusion of certain testimony; and (3) imposition of a\r\n  ninety-day suspension.\r\nâ€œThis Court has the\r\n  sole authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the appropriate sanction\r\n  after a thorough review of the record.â€Â  In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10,\r\n  539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  â€œAlthough this Court is not bound by the findings\r\n  of the Panel and Committee, these findings are entitled to great weight,\r\n  particularly when the inferences to be drawn from the testimony depend on the\r\n  credibility of witnesses.â€Â  In re Marshall, 331 S.C. 514, 519, 498\r\n  S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998).Â Â  â€œHowever, this Court may make its own findings of fact\r\n  and conclusions of law.â€Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, a disciplinary violation\r\n  must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  In re Greene, 371 S.C.\r\n  207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006).\r\nI.&nbsp;Factual Findings\r\nIn\r\n  terms of the Panelâ€™s factual findings, Respondent contends the Panel erred in:Â \r\n  (1) finding that his testimony was not credible; (2) placing emphasis on the\r\n  fact that he settled the case for less than Client had authorized; (3) finding\r\n  he violated GEICOâ€™s instructions to hold the settlement proceeds in escrow\r\n  until the Release was signed by Client and her husband; (4) finding he did not\r\n  have proper authorization from Client to settle her case; (5) finding he failed\r\n  to present Client with any settlement or disbursement statement; (6) placing\r\n  emphasis on the fact that he obtained medical releases from Client after the\r\n  case was settled; and (7) making a statement that Respondentâ€™s failure to\r\n  promptly return the settlement proceeds to GEICO after requested to do so by Attorney\r\n  caused the Panel â€œgrave concern.â€ \r\nThe Panel prefaced\r\n  its decision with a specific finding that Respondentâ€™s testimony was not\r\n  credible.Â  Because the inferences drawn from testimony in the record depended\r\n  largely on the credibility of the witnesses, we believe this finding by the\r\n  Panel is significant in terms of assessing Respondentâ€™s exceptions to the\r\n  Panelâ€™s ultimate decision. \r\nDeferring to the\r\n  Panel on its credibility determination, we find there is evidence to support\r\n  each of the factual findings challenged by Respondent.Â  First, Client denied\r\n  ever authorizing Respondent to settle her case for $6,000.Â  Thus, the Panelâ€™s\r\n  emphasis on the fact that Respondent settled Clientâ€™s claim for less than\r\n  $6,000 does not establish error on the part of the Panel as argued by\r\n  Respondent.Â  Instead, the Panelâ€™s finding was merely intended to support its\r\n  determination as to Respondentâ€™s credibility.Â  \r\nSecondly,\r\n  Respondent admitted that he endorsed the settlement check, deposited it into\r\n  his trust account, and transferred his legal fees to his operating account.Â \r\n  Clearly, Respondentâ€™s actions were in direct violation of the instructions by\r\n  GEICO that Respondent retain the settlement proceeds in his trust account until\r\n  the parties signed and returned the Release.Â  Even if, as Respondent contends,\r\n  the settlement check was received prior to the GEICO instruction letter, this\r\n  would not negate Respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  Once he received the letter,\r\n  Respondent should have withdrawn his legal fees from the operating account and\r\n  transferred them back to his trust account.Â  Furthermore, Respondent was aware\r\n  on August 22, 2005, that Client did not intend to sign the GEICO release.Â \r\n  Thus, per GEICOâ€™s instruction, Respondent should have returned his legal fees\r\n  to his trust account until the matter was resolved.Â  As of the date of the\r\n  Panel hearing on June 27, 2007, Respondent still retained the amount of his\r\n  legal fees in his operating account.Â  \r\nThirdly, again\r\n  deferring to the Panelâ€™s credibility determination, there is evidence to\r\n  support the Panelâ€™s finding that Respondent did not have proper authorization\r\n  to settle Clientâ€™s case.Â  Respondentâ€™s reliance on his retainer agreement to\r\n  support his decision to settle the case is misplaced.Â  The terms of the\r\n  retainer agreement only authorized Respondent to receive a settlement check and\r\n  endorse a clientâ€™s name if the client agreed to the proposed settlement.Â  Here,\r\n  Client adamantly denied authorizing Respondent to settle her case.Â  \r\nFourthly, there is\r\n  evidence to support the Panelâ€™s finding that Client had not signed any\r\n  settlement or disbursement statement.Â  Respondent admitted that Client never\r\n  signed a release for the settlement check.Â  Moreover, even at their last\r\n  meeting on August 22, 2005, Client expressed dissatisfaction with the settlement,\r\n  did not sign any documents, and ceased all further contact with Respondent.Â  \r\nFifthly, there is\r\n  evidence to support the Panelâ€™s finding that Respondent sought to obtain\r\n  medical releases for Clientâ€™s records after the case was settled.Â  Respondent\r\n  believes this finding was irrelevant to a determination of misconduct.Â  We\r\n  believe the Panelâ€™s finding was intended to establish that Respondent was not a\r\n  credible witness.Â  Respondent never adequately explained his decision to seek a\r\n  medical release to obtain Clientâ€™s medical records in August 2005 after he had\r\n  settled the case in July 2005.Â  According to Respondent, he claimed he had in\r\n  his possession all of Clientâ€™s medical records at the time he entered into the\r\n  settlement agreement.Â  Respondent also testified that he informed Client on\r\n  August 22, 2005, that the case had been settled and nothing could be done\r\n  regarding any additional medical treatment for her injuries.Â  Thus, the fact\r\n  that he requested additional medical records after the settlement and this\r\n  meeting created a discrepancy in Respondentâ€™s testimony and would again draw\r\n  into question his credibility.Â  \r\nFinally, the Panel\r\n  was justified in expressing concern over the fact that Respondent declined to\r\n  promptly return the settlement proceeds to GEICO when requested by Attorney.Â \r\n  Respondent admitted that Client never signed a settlement release.Â  He also\r\n  knew of the correspondence between Attorney and GEICO regarding a potential\r\n  settlement of Clientâ€™s claim.Â  Therefore, Respondent was aware that Clientâ€™s\r\n  personal injury claim with GEICO had not been finalized.Â Â  Despite this\r\n  knowledge, Respondent delayed returning the funds to GEICO.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Respondent never relinquished the amount of his attorney fees even though he\r\n  failed to procure a final settlement for Client.Â  Respondentâ€™s failure to\r\n  promptly return the entire amount of the settlement proceeds impeded Attorneyâ€™s\r\n  progress in pursuing Clientâ€™s claim with GEICO.\r\nII. Exclusion of Testimony\r\nRespondent contends the Panel erred in ruling that\r\n  neither he nor his proposed witness (Witness B) could testify regarding\r\n  problems Respondent encountered with Attorney prior to his representation of Client.\r\nAt the start of the\r\n  hearing, Respondentâ€™s counsel indicated that he intended to call Witness B, a\r\n  former client of Attorneyâ€™s and a member of Respondentâ€™s office staff who was\r\n  also his client.Â  According to Respondentâ€™s counsel, Witness B was to testify\r\n  regarding the â€œbad bloodâ€ that existed between Respondent and Attorney prior to\r\n  the Client matter.Â  Counsel also intended to elicit testimony from Witness B\r\n  regarding a grievance she had filed against Attorney.Â  Disciplinary counsel\r\n  objected to the admission of this testimony on the ground it was irrelevant to\r\n  a determination of Respondentâ€™s alleged misconduct.Â  After hearing arguments\r\n  from counsel, the Panel ruled that Respondentâ€™s counsel could not present any\r\n  testimony regarding a grievance against Attorney and needed to limit the\r\n  testimony to only the interactions between Attorney and Respondent regarding\r\n  the Client matter.\r\nUnless provided otherwise in a specific rule, the\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Evidence for non-jury civil matters and the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply to lawyer disciplinary proceedings.Â  Rule\r\n  413, SCACR; Rule 9, RLDE.Â  We hold the Panel properly limited the proposed\r\n  testimony on the ground that it was not relevant.Â  See Rule 401, SCRE (â€œâ€˜Relevantâ€™ evidence means evidence having any tendency\r\n  to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination\r\n  of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the\r\n  evidence.â€); Rule 402, SCRE (â€œAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as\r\n  otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution\r\n  of the State of South Carolina, statutes, these rules, or by other rules\r\n  promulgated by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. Â Evidence which is not\r\n  relevant is not admissible.â€).Â  Because the Panel was only considering the\r\n  formal charges against Respondent, the testimony presented was properly\r\n  confined to Respondentâ€™s representation of Client.Â  Furthermore, given that Attorney\r\n  was called as a witness, Respondentâ€™s counsel was able to attack her\r\n  credibility and establish any potential bias or prejudice she may have had\r\n  against Respondent. \r\nIII. Ninety-Day Suspension\r\nFinally, Respondent challenges the Panelâ€™s\r\n  recommendation of a ninety-day suspension.Â  He contends the recommendation was\r\n  not warranted because: (1) his endorsement of Clientâ€™s husbandâ€™s name on the\r\n  GEICO settlement check was â€œeither harmless error, or such an error as should\r\n  not cause a suspension of his license;â€ and (2) the evidence did not support\r\n  the Panelâ€™s findings that he committed several serious breaches of ethical\r\n  conduct in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. \r\nA.\r\nIn its report, the\r\n  Panel concluded that Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule 1.1, RPC (â€œA lawyer shall provide competent\r\n  representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal\r\n  knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the\r\n  representation.â€); Rule 1.2, RPC (â€œSubject to paragraphs (c) and (d), a lawyer\r\n  shall abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation\r\n  and, as required by Rule 1.4, shall consult with the client as to the means by\r\n  which they are to be pursued. Â A lawyer may take such action on behalf of the\r\n  client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation. Â A lawyer\r\n  shall abide by a clientâ€™s decision whether to make or accept an offer of\r\n  settlement of a matter.â€); Rule 1.4, RPC (providing that a lawyer shall keep\r\n  the client informed and consult with the client regarding means by which\r\n  clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished); Rule 1.5, RPC (stating that â€œ[u]pon\r\n  conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with\r\n  a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a\r\n  recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its\r\n  determinationâ€); Rule 1.15, RPC (providing that a lawyer shall: Â safeguard\r\n  clientâ€™s property; deposit unearned legal fees into client trust account; and\r\n  render full accounting regarding clientâ€™s property); Rule 8.4(d), RPC (stating\r\n  it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to â€œengage in conduct involving\r\n  dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentationâ€); and Rule 8.4(e), RPC (stating\r\n  it is professional misconduct for a lawyer â€œengage in conduct that is\r\n  prejudicial to the administration of justiceâ€).\r\nWe hold there was\r\n  clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated each of the above-listed\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  Deferring to the credibility determination of\r\n  the Panel, Client testified she never authorized Respondent to settle her\r\n  case.Â  Yet, Respondent settled Clientâ€™s claim without her consent and despite\r\n  the knowledge that she was still receiving medical treatment for her injuries.Â \r\n  We find this conduct was in violation of Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope\r\n  of Representation; Allocation of Authority between Client and Lawyer); and Rule\r\n  1.4 (Communication).Â  Furthermore, Respondent engaged in fraudulent conduct in\r\n  violation of Rule 8.4(d) when he signed Clientâ€™s husbandâ€™s name to the\r\n  settlement check without his consent and without an agreement to represent\r\n  him.Â  In terms of Respondentâ€™s handling of the settlement proceeds,\r\n  Respondentâ€™s decision to negotiate the settlement check in violation of GEICOâ€™s\r\n  instructions and to disburse his legal fees to his operating account\r\n  constitutes a violation of Rule 1.5 (procedure lawyer should follow after\r\n  conclusion of contingent fee matter) and Rule 1.15 (safekeeping clientâ€™s\r\n  property).Â  Finally, Respondentâ€™s failure to promptly return the entire amount\r\n  of the settlement proceeds to GEICO prevented Attorney from expeditiously\r\n  pursuing Clientâ€™s personal injury claim; therefore, we find this conduct was in\r\n  violation of Rule 8.4(e) (conduct which is prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice).Â  Although not listed by the Panel, we also find this conduct violated\r\n  Rule 1.16(d) (â€œUpon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to\r\n  the extent reasonably practicable to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as\r\n  giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other\r\n  counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and\r\n  refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or\r\n  incurred. Â The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent\r\n  permitted by other law. The lawyer may retain a reasonable nonrefundable\r\n  retainer.â€).\r\nB.\r\nWith respect to the\r\n  Panelâ€™s recommendation of a ninety-day suspension, there is precedent to\r\n  establish that this sanction is within the range this Court has imposed in the\r\n  past where attorneys have engaged in similar misconduct.Â  However, due to\r\n  Respondentâ€™s egregious conduct and the fact that he has been sanctioned by this\r\n  Court in the past,[3] we find the Panelâ€™s recommendation is inadequate and a harsher sanction is\r\n  warranted.Â  Therefore, we hereby sanction Respondent to a six-month definite\r\n  suspension and order him to pay the costs of the proceedings.Â  See, e.g., In re Nwangaza, 362 S.C. 208, 608 S.E.2d 132 (2005) (finding public\r\n  reprimand was warranted, upon submission of agreement, where attorney\r\n  negotiated personal injury settlement check without clientâ€™s\r\n  consent/endorsement;

DuRant, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense,\r\n          Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, and Ernest Charles Grose, Jr., of Greenwood, for Appellant.\r\n        John\r\n          Benjamin Aplin, of SC Department of Probation Parole and Pardon, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â Â Â  In this direct appeal,\r\n  Leroy McGrier challenges the circuit courtâ€™s order revoking six months for\r\n  violating the conditions of the Community Supervision Program (â€œCSPâ€).Â  McGrier\r\n  contends the CSP statute, specifically section 24-21-560(D) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, is unconstitutional given a revocation from the CSP resulted in\r\n  the imposition of a greater sentence than his original sentence without the\r\n  benefit of the requisite constitutional protections.Â  After we issued our\r\n  original opinion reversing the decision of the circuit court, the State\r\n  petitioned for rehearing.Â  We deny the petition for rehearing, withdraw our\r\n  original opinion, and substitute it with this opinion which corrects\r\n  non-substantive scrivenerâ€™s errors. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 16, 1999, McGrier pleaded guilty to two\r\n  counts of distribution of crack cocaine (third offense).Â  The circuit court\r\n  judge sentenced McGrier to three years imprisonment on each count.Â  The\r\n  sentences were to be served concurrently.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 4, 2002, after serving eighty-five percent of the original term of\r\n  imprisonment,[1] McGrier was released pursuant to section 24-21-560[2] of the South Carolina Code to the CSP of the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services (the Department).Â Â  The ending date of\r\n  McGrierâ€™s participation in the CSP was set for May 3, 2004. \r\nOn\r\n  February 23, 2004, McGrier appeared before Circuit Court Judge Wyatt T.\r\n  Saunders for a revocation hearing.Â  After finding McGrier willfully violated\r\n  the terms of the CSP, Judge Saunders revoked the CSP and ordered that McGrier\r\n  be remanded to the custody of the South Carolina Department of Corrections for\r\n  a period of four months.[3]Â \r\n  After serving this sentence, McGrier was again released to CSP on June 23, 2004,\r\n  and assigned a supervision ending date of June 22, 2006.\r\nOn\r\n  April 11, 2005, McGrier appeared before Judge Saunders for a CSP revocation hearing.Â \r\n  At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Saunders found McGrier had willfully\r\n  violated the conditions of the CSP.Â  As a result, Judge Saunders revoked CSP,\r\n  sentenced McGrier to six months imprisonment, and recommended that McGrier\r\n  participate in the Alcohol Treatment Unit (ATU) while incarcerated.Â  Upon\r\n  completion of this sentence, McGrier was again released to the CSP on September\r\n  30, 2005.Â  On April 3, 2006, McGrier appeared before Judge Saunders for a CSP\r\n  violation hearing.Â  Finding that McGrier willfully violated the terms of the\r\n  CSP, Judge Saunders permitted McGrierâ€™s continued participation in the CSP but\r\n  ordered that he be held in jail until he was accepted into an in-patient\r\n  substance abuse treatment program. \r\nOn\r\n  October 30, 2006, McGrier appeared before Circuit Court Judge J. Cordell\r\n  Maddox, Jr., for violating the terms of the CSP.Â  After finding that McGrier\r\n  willfully violated the terms and conditions of the CSP, Judge Maddox revoked\r\n  McGrierâ€™s CSP and sentenced him to ninety days imprisonment.Â  As part of the\r\n  order, Judge Maddox specified that McGrier would not be awarded time-served\r\n  credit, good-time credit, or work credit.Â  McGrier appealed this order to the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 27, 2007, McGrier was released from the Department of Corrections to\r\n  the CSP with a supervision ending date of January 26, 2009.Â  On February 6,\r\n  2007, McGrier was served with an arrest warrant in which it was alleged that he\r\n  violated the terms and conditions of the CSP by failing to:Â  report since his release\r\n  date of January 27, 2007; report to be placed on an electronic monitoring\r\n  device; and follow the advice and instructions of his probation agent.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on these alleged violations, McGrier appeared before Circuit Court Judge\r\n  Kenneth G. Goode on April 2, 2007, for a CSP revocation hearing. Â At the\r\n  hearing, McGrier, who was represented by counsel, contended he should be\r\n  released from the CSP because â€œhis [original] sentence has been satisfied by\r\n  the earlier revocation.â€Â  In support of this argument, McGrier primarily relied\r\n  on Justice Pleiconesâ€™ dissent in State v. Mills, 360 S.C. 621, 602\r\n  S.E.2d 750 (2004), to challenge the constitutionality of section 24-21-560(D).Â \r\n  Ultimately, Judge Goode rejected this argument and found that McGrier had\r\n  willfully violated the terms and conditions of the CSP.Â  As a result, Judge Goode\r\n  revoked McGrierâ€™s CSP and sentenced him to a six-month term of imprisonment.Â \r\n  McGrier appeals from this order.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  McGrier asserts the circuit court judge erred in\r\n  finding section 24-21-560(D) constitutional.Â  Because a revocation under the\r\n  CSP statute can result in a sentence that exceeds the original sentence,\r\n  McGrier contends he is entitled to the protections afforded all criminal\r\n  defendants.Â  Specifically, he claims his sentence was increased without the\r\n  benefit of the right to be informed of the charges against him, the right to\r\n  counsel, and the right to a jury trial.Â  Given that the revocation procedure\r\n  under the CSP statute does not provide for these rights, McGrier claims the\r\n  statute is unconstitutional.\r\nIn support of this\r\n  argument, McGrier primarily relies on Justice Pleiconesâ€™ dissent in State v.\r\n    Mills, 360 S.C. 621, 602 S.E.2d 750 (2004).Â  In Mills, the defendant\r\n  pleaded guilty to distribution of crack cocaine, second offense, and was\r\n  sentenced to six months imprisonment.Â  After serving five months and two days,\r\n  he entered a CSP which was to continue for two years.Â  After a circuit court\r\n  judge found the defendant violated the terms of his CSP, the judge revoked the defendantâ€™s\r\n  CSP and sentenced him to five months and seven days pursuant to section\r\n  24-21-560(D) of the South Carolina Code.Â  Id. at 622, 602 S.E.2d at\r\n  751.Â  \r\nMills\r\n  appealed the circuit courtâ€™s order, arguing that section 24-21-560(D) limited\r\n  his sentence for revocation to the remaining time left on his original sentence\r\n  for the substantive crime.Â  Mills claimed that because he had served five\r\n  months and two days, as well as three weeks on a prior revocation, his\r\n  revocation sentence should not have exceeded five days.Â  Essentially, Mills\r\n  averred the circuit court misinterpreted section 24-21-560(D) to permit a\r\n  revocation sentence that was â€œalmost doubleâ€ his original sentence.Â  Id. at 623, 602 S.E.2d at 751.Â  According to Mills, his sentence for revocation\r\n  could only equal the amount of unserved time remaining on his original\r\n  sentence.\r\nA\r\n  majority of this Court rejected Millsâ€™ assertion on the ground his claim was\r\n  not supported by the plain reading of section 24-21-560(D).Â  In reaching this\r\n  conclusion, the Court stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  Subsection\r\n    (C) of Â§ 24-21-560 provides that â€œthe court may revoke the prisonerâ€™s community\r\n    supervision and impose a sentence of up to one year for a violation of the\r\n    community supervision program.â€ Subsection (D) then provides that for a successive revocation, the prisoner may be sentenced â€œas provided in [subsection] (C)â€ i.e.,\r\n    for up to one year, with the limitation that the total time imposed â€œfor\r\n    successive revocationsâ€ i.e., all revocations, cannot exceed the\r\n    length of time of the prisonerâ€™s original sentence. Â Subsection (D) does not\r\n    provide, as appellant contends, that the sentence for any successive revocation\r\n    is limited to the amount of time remaining on the prisonerâ€™s original sentence,\r\n    nor does this statute inevitably result in the â€œdoublingâ€ of a prisonerâ€™s\r\n    sentence. \r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  624, 602 S.E.2d at 752.Â  Applying the above-outlined reasoning, the Court\r\n  affirmed the circuit court judgeâ€™s sentence of five months and seven days on\r\n  the ground that Mills had served three weeks on his prior revocation and his\r\n  time for all revocations could not exceed six months.Â  Id. at 625, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 752.\r\nJustice Pleicones disagreed with the majorityâ€™s reading\r\n  of section 24-21-560,Â  stating that â€œ[t]he majority holds that S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-21-560 (Supp. 2003) permits an inmate found to have violated the terms of\r\n  his community supervision (CSP) to serve an additional sentence, up to\r\n  an amount equal to the period of incarceration imposed as part [of] his\r\n  original sentence.â€Â  Id. at 625, 602 S.E.2d at 752.Â  Justice Pleicones\r\n  explained, â€œif the revocation judge is truly imposing a new sentence of up to\r\n  one year, then the protections afforded all criminal defendants, including but\r\n  not limited to the right to an indictment, counsel, and a jury, must be afforded\r\n  her.â€ Â Id. at 625 n.3, 602 S.E.2d at 752 n.3. Â Although Justice\r\n  Pleicones agreed with the majorityâ€™s literal interpretation of the statute, he\r\n  believed such a reading rendered the statute unconstitutional.Â  Id. at 626, 602 S.E.2d at 752.Â  In his opinion, Justice Pleicones read the statute\r\n  â€œas putting an outside limit on incarceration of twice the period imposed by\r\n  the trial judge.Â  The outside limit on the total amount of time an inmate could\r\n  be incarcerated and/or required to participate in the CSP program is the length\r\n  of the original sentence, that is, the term of incarceration plus any period of\r\n  suspension.â€Â  Id. at 626, 602 S.E.2d at 753.Â  Based on this analysis,\r\n  Justice Pleicones found the maximum time Mills â€œcould constitutionally be\r\n  subjected to incarceration and/or required to participate in the CSP program\r\n  pursuant to [his original sentence] was six months.â€Â  Because the six-month\r\n  period had expired, Justice Pleicones found the circuit court judge erred in\r\n  reincarcerating Mills.Â  Id.\r\nAt least facially, Mills would\r\n  require this Court to affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order in the instant case.Â  Because McGrier has served an aggregate of nineteen\r\n  months as the result of his CSP revocations, under Mills, the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order was appropriate given McGrierâ€™s additional periods of\r\n  incarceration have not exceeded his original, thirty-six month sentence. However, we believe this case presents an\r\n  opportunity for the Court to reconsider its decision in Mills in light\r\n  of several arguments that were not previously raised.Â  See Mills,\r\n  360 S.C. at 624, 602 S.E.2d at 752 (stating â€œwe emphasize that the only issue\r\n  before us is the construction of this particular statute and not the wisdom of\r\n  the CSP statutory scheme as a wholeâ€).Â  \r\nAlthough we believe this Court properly employed\r\n  the rules of statutory construction in deciding Mills, we did not at\r\n  that time envision the problems that would arise out of a practical application\r\n  of the decision.Â  Upon further reflection, we believe Mills does not\r\n  effectuate what the Legislature intended by enacting the CSP.Â  We reach this\r\n  result cognizant of our duty to ascertain the intent of the Legislature and to\r\n  give it effect so far as possible within constitutional limitations.Â  Brown\r\n    v. County of Horry, 308 S.C. 180, 183, 417 S.E.2d 565, 567 (1992) (â€œIt is a\r\n  settled rule of statutory construction that it is the\r\n  duty of the court to ascertain the intent of the Legislature and to give it\r\n  effect so far as possible within constitutional limitations.â€).\r\nAn elementary and cardinal rule of statutory construction is that courts must ascertain and\r\n  effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature. Horn v. Davis Elec.\r\n    Constructors, Inc., 307 S.C. 559, 563, 416 S.E.2d 634, 636 (1992); Browning\r\n      v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992); see State v. Ramsey, 311\r\n  S.C. 555, 561, 430 S.E.2d 511, 515 (1993) (â€œIn the interpretation of statutes,\r\n  our sole function is to determine and, within constitutional limits, give\r\n  effect to the intention of the legislature, with reference to the meaning of\r\n  the language used and the subject matter and purpose of the statute.â€). \r\nâ€œThis Court has long recognized that\r\n  legislative acts are to be construed in favor of constitutionality and will be\r\n  presumed constitutional absent a showing to the contrary.â€ Bailey v. State,\r\n  309 S.C. 455, 464, 424 S.E.2d 503, 508 (1992).Â  â€œâ€˜It is always to be presumed\r\n  that the Legislature acted in good faith and within constitutional limits; and\r\n  this declaration of the Legislature is a conclusive finding of fact and imports\r\n  a verity upon its face which cannot be impugned by litigants, counsel, or the\r\n  courts, but is absolutely binding upon all.â€™â€ Â Scroggie v. Scarborough,\r\n  162 S.C. 218, 231, 160 S.E. 596, 601 (1931) (quoting State ex rel. Weldon v.\r\n    Thomason, 221 S.W. 491, 495 (Tenn. 1919)). â€œConstitutional constructions of\r\n  statutes are not only judicially preferred, they are mandated; a possible\r\n  constitutional construction must prevail over\r\n  an unconstitutional interpretation.â€Â  Henderson v. Evans, 268\r\n  S.C. 127, 132, 232 S.E.2d 331, 333-34 (1977).\r\nAs we read section 24-21-560(B) in light\r\n  of Mills, the continuous two-year term in CSP begins anew each time a\r\n  participant is released into the program after a period of incarceration.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(B) (2007) (â€œA community supervision program operated by the Department of\r\n  Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services must last no more than two continuous\r\n  years.â€). Â If, as in\r\n  McGrierâ€™s case, there are successive revocations, the two-year period could\r\n  produce a never-ending cycle of participation in CSP and an incarceration period\r\n  which would clearly exceed or extend past the originally ordered term of\r\n  incarceration.Â  See State v. Bennett, 375 S.C. 165, 174\r\n  n.6, 650 S.E.2d 490, 495 n.6 (Ct. App. 2007) (discussing the fact that successive\r\n  CSP revocations resulted in defendant serving seven years, four months, and\r\n  three days for an original four-year sentence).Â  To read the statute in this\r\n  manner, as Justice Pleiconesâ€™ noted in his dissent, would render it\r\n  unconstitutional in several respects. \r\nInitially, we find a practical application\r\n  of Mills would violate a defendantâ€™s procedural due process rights.Â  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3 (No\r\n  person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of\r\n  law.). Â Here, the imposition\r\n  of a sentence which exceeds the defendantâ€™s original term of incarceration\r\n  involves a situation where the defendant has not received notice that the terms\r\n  of his original sentence would be modified and a greater punishment imposed.Â  See State v. Allen, 370 S.C. 88, 97, 634 S.E.2d 653, 657 (2006) (â€œâ€˜It is an\r\n  essential component of due process that individuals be given fair warning of\r\n  those acts which may lead to a loss of liberty. Â This is no less true whether\r\n  the loss of liberty arises from a criminal conviction or the revocation of\r\n  probation . . . [W]here the proscribed acts are not criminal, due process\r\n  mandates that [a probationer or parolee] cannot be subjected to forfeiture of\r\n  his liberty for those acts unless he is given prior fair warning.â€™â€ (quoting U.S.\r\n    v. Dane, 570 F.2d 840, 843-44 (9th Cir. 1977))); Hord v. Commonwealth,\r\n  450 S.W.2d 530, 531-32 (Ky. Ct. App. 1970) (â€œDue process of law . . . must be\r\n  followed to insure a valid conviction of [a defendantâ€™s] felonious charge.Â  Due\r\n  process does not contemplate that months or years later his â€˜trialâ€™ may be\r\n  opened and a greater punishment imposed.â€). \r\nÂ Although McGrier was on notice by the\r\n  terms of the statute that the completion of the CSP was a requirement of his\r\n  originally-imposed sentence,[4] he would not have been aware that his participation in this program could\r\n  potentially be in perpetuity. Â See State v. Dawkins, 352\r\n  S.C. 162, 167, 573 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2002) (finding defendantâ€™s five-year\r\n  probation sentence was discharged after he successfully completed a community\r\n  supervision program pursuant to section 24-21-560(E) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code); State v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 590, 571 S.E.2d 700, 703 (2002)\r\n  (holding, pursuant to section 24-21-560 of the South Carolina Code, defendant\r\n  was required to participate in CSP and not be placed on probation even though\r\n  he â€œmaxed outâ€ his active sentence through good-conduct credits given defendant\r\n  had not served his entire active term of incarceration until he completed a CSP).Â  Conceivably, had McGrier been aware of the potential sentencing\r\n  consequences, he may not have decided to plead guilty.Â  Â \r\nFurthermore, we believe a literal\r\n  interpretation of the CSP statute, as in Mills, would improperly permit\r\n  a CSP violation to become a separate and distinct criminal offense from that\r\n  which a defendant was convicted without the benefit of the requisite Sixth\r\n  Amendment constitutional protections.Â  \r\nâ€œThe Sixth Amendment rights to notice,\r\n  confrontation, and compulsory process guarantee that a criminal charge may be\r\n  answered through the calling and interrogation of favorable witnesses, the\r\n  cross-examination of adverse witnesses, and the orderly introduction of\r\n  evidence.â€Â  State v. Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, 303, 342 S.E.2d 401, 402\r\n  (1986). Â â€œThese basic rights are applicable to the states through the due\r\n  process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.â€ Id. â€œThe Amendment\r\n  essentially â€˜constitutionalizesâ€™ the right to present a defense in an adversary\r\n  criminal trial.â€ Id.Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that neither McGrier nor\r\n  other CSP violators have been afforded these protections.Â  To contend, as does\r\n  the Department, that the Sixth Amendment protections are inapplicable to the\r\n  revocation of CSP because it does not involve a criminal prosecution would be a\r\n  matter of semantics that minimizes or essentially ignores the consequences of a\r\n  revocation.Â  Our United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that, â€œunder\r\n  the Sixth Amendment, any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater potential\r\n  sentence must be found by a jury, not a judge,\r\n  and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.â€ Cunningham v. California, 127 S.Ct. 856, 863-64 (2007)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Although McGrier, and other similarly situated defendants,\r\n  are not in actuality being convicted for a second time, they are being given an\r\n  additional sentence for violating the terms of CSP.Â  Because CSP is a\r\n  collateral consequence of a conviction for a â€œno-parole offense,â€ revocations\r\n  for successive CSP violations should not extend or exceed the term of\r\n  incarceration that was originally ordered for the underlying offense.Â  Jackson\r\n    v. State, 349 S.C. 62, 64, 562 S.E.2d 475, 475 (2002) (holding\r\n  participation in CSP is a collateral consequence of sentencing).\r\nAs illustrated by the foregoing, we\r\n  believe a practical application of our decision in Mills renders the CSP\r\n  statute unconstitutional.Â  Moreover, in our view, the purpose of the CSP\r\n  statute is to continue supervision during the remaining term of the original\r\n  sentence.Â  Because the CSP program is a more stringent program than traditional\r\n  probation, we believe the Legislature did not intend for this form of\r\n  supervision to have the effect of increasing an inmateâ€™s original sentence for\r\n  a â€œno parole offense.â€Â  See Dawkins, 352 S.C. at 167, 573 S.E.2d at\r\n  785 (â€œThe CSP is a more stringent,\r\n  closely monitored form of supervision than normal probation. Even considering\r\n  Part E in the context of the statute as a whole, we believe the legislature\r\n  intended mandatory participation in the CSP to serve as a\r\n  more rigorous term of probation for those convicted of no-parole offenses, in\r\n  lieu of normal probation.â€). \r\nTherefore, to effectuate the intent of the\r\n  Legislature and remain within the confines of constitutional limitations, we\r\n  have decided to change our position regarding an interpretation of the\r\n  following statutory language:\r\n\r\n  The maximum aggregate amount of time the prisoner may be required\r\n    to serve when sentenced for successive revocations may not exceed an amount of\r\n    time equal to the length of incarceration imposed for the original â€œno parole\r\n    offense.â€ The original term of incarceration does not include any portion of a\r\n    suspended sentence.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(D) (2007).Â  We now\r\n  read this language as limiting the total amount of time an inmate could be\r\n  incarcerated after a CSP revocation to be the length of the remaining balance\r\n  of the sentence for the â€œno parole offense.â€Â  Based on this interpretation, a\r\n  circuit court may not impose a sentence for a CSP revocation that would result\r\n  in an inmate being incarcerated for an aggregate period of time that extended\r\n  beyond the unsuspended portion of the original sentence. Â Thus, assuming an\r\n  inmate has served at least eighty-five percent of the unsuspended portion of\r\n  his original sentence, an inmate whose CSP is revoked is limited to serving an\r\n  amount of time equal to the remaining fifteen percent balance of this sentence.Â \r\n  We believe this construction preserves the presumed validity and constitutionality\r\n  of the CSP statute as mandated by our rules of statutory construction.Â  Cf. Thomas v. State, 838 So. 2d 701, 702 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\r\n  2003) (holding sentence of incarceration that exceeded suspended portion of\r\n  previously imposed sentence of incarceration, which resulted from violation of\r\n  community control, was illegal).\r\nApplying our holding to the facts of the instant case,\r\n  we find the circuit court erred in reincarcerating McGrier given he has served\r\n  eighty-five percent of the original, three-year term of imprisonment and has served\r\n  an aggregate of nineteen months as a result of the CSP revocations.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Section 24-13-150(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except in a case in\r\n    which the death penalty or a term of life imprisonment is imposed, a prisoner\r\n    convicted of a â€œno parole offenseâ€ as defined in Section 24-13-100 and\r\n    sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections, including a prisoner\r\n    serving time in a local facility pursuant to a designated facility agreement\r\n    authorized by Section 24-3-20, is not eligible for early release, discharge, or\r\n    community supervision as provided in Section 24-21-560, until the prisoner\r\n      has served at least eighty-five percent of the actual term of imprisonment\r\n      imposed.Â  This percentage must be calculated without the application of\r\n    earned work credits, education credits, or good conduct credits, and is to be\r\n    applied to the actual term of imprisonment imposed, not including any portion\r\n    of the sentence which has been suspended. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-13-150(A) (2007) (emphasis added).Â  Distribution of crack cocaine, third\r\n  offense, has been designated as a â€œno parole offense.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.

No prisoner who is serving a sentence for a â€œno parole offenseâ€ is\r\n    eligible to participate in a community supervision program until he has served\r\n    the minimum period of incarceration as set forth in Section 24-13-150.Â \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(A)\r\n  (2007). \r\n[3]Â Â  Sections 24-21-560(C) and (D) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code provide in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  (C) If the\r\n    department determines that a prisoner has violated a term of the community\r\n    supervision program and the community supervision should be revoked, a\r\n    probation agent must initiate a proceeding in General Sessions Court. The\r\n    proceeding must be initiated pursuant to a warrant or a citation issued by a probation agent setting forth the violations of the community\r\n    supervision program. The court shall determine whether:\r\n  (1) the terms of the community supervision\r\n    program are fair and reasonable;\r\n    (2) the prisoner has complied with the\r\n    terms of the community supervision program;\r\n    (3) the prisoner should continue in the\r\n    community supervision program under the current terms;\r\n    (4) the prisoner should continue in the\r\n    community supervision program under other terms and conditions as the court\r\n    considers appropriate;\r\n    (5) the prisoner has wilfully violated a\r\n    term of the community supervision program.\r\n  If the court determines that a prisoner\r\n    has wilfully violated a term or condition of the community supervision program,\r\n    the court may impose any other terms or conditions considered appropriate and\r\n    may continue the prisoner on community supervision, or the court may revoke the\r\n    prisonerâ€™s community supervision and impose a sentence of up to one year for\r\n    violation of the community supervision program. A prisoner who is incarcerated\r\n    for revocation of the community supervision program is not eligible to earn any\r\n    type of credits which would reduce the sentence for\r\n    violation of the community supervision program.\r\n  (D) If a prisonerâ€™s community supervision is revoked by the court\r\n    and the court imposes a period of incarceration for the revocation, the\r\n    prisoner also must complete a community supervision program of up to two years\r\n    as determined by the department pursuant to subsection (B) when he is released\r\n    from incarceration.\r\n  A prisoner who is sentenced for successive\r\n    revocations of the community supervision program may be required to serve terms\r\n    of incarceration for successive revocations, as provided in Section\r\n    24-21-560(C), and may be required to serve additional periods of community\r\n    supervision for successive revocations, as provided in Section 24-21-560(D). Â The\r\n    maximum aggregate amount of time the prisoner may be required to serve when\r\n    sentenced for successive revocations may not exceed an amount of time equal to\r\n    the length of incarceration imposed for the original â€œno parole offenseâ€. The\r\n    original term of incarceration does not include any portion of a suspended\r\n    sentence.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code\r\n  Ann.

Const., Art.\r\n  III, Â§ 17 provides that â€œ[e]very Act or resolution having the force of law\r\n  shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.â€ Â Â  The\r\n  purpose of Article III, Â§ 17 is (1) to apprise the members of the General\r\n  Assembly of the contents of an act by reading the title, (2) prevent\r\n  legislative log-rolling and (3) inform the people of the state of the matters\r\n  with which the General Assembly concerns itself.Â  Sloan v. Wilkins, 362\r\n  S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d 579 (2005).Â  See also Keyserling v.\r\n    Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 470 S.E.2d 100 (1996).Â  Article III, Â§ 17 is to be\r\n  liberally construed so as to uphold an Act if practicable.Â  Id.; McCollum\r\n    v.

S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 274 S.C. 137, 141, 262\r\n  S.E.2d 45, 47 (1980).Â  \r\na.Â  Act 49\r\nThe\r\n  first Act challenged by Petitioners is 2007 Act No. 49, which establishes the\r\n  South Carolina Critical Needs Nursing Initiative Act.Â  The title to Act 49, as\r\n  initially written, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    BILL TO AMEND THE CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, 1976, BY ADDING CHAPTER 110\r\n    TO TITLE 59 SO AS TO ENACT THE â€œSOUTH CAROLINA CRITICAL NEEDS NURSING\r\n    INITIATIVE ACTâ€ INCLUDING PROVISIONS ESTABLISHING THE CRITICAL NEEDS NURSING\r\n    INITIATIVE FUND, TO IMPROVE THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED NURSES IN THIS STATE BY\r\n    PROVIDING NURSING FACULTY SALARY ENHANCEMENTS, CREATING NEW FACULTY POSITIONS,\r\n    PROVIDING FOR ADDITIONAL NURSING STUDENT SCHOLARSHIPS, LOANS, AND GRANTS,\r\n    ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE RESEARCH TO ANALYZE HEALTH\r\n    CARE WORKFORCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND, AND PROVIDING FOR THE USE OF SIMULATION\r\n    TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT IN THE EDUCATION OF NURSES.\r\n\r\nThe bill went through three\r\n  readings with minor changes until May 22, 2007, when its title was amended to add\r\n  the following provisions:\r\n\r\n  TO\r\n    AMEND SECTION 40-43-83, AS AMENDED, RELATING TO IN STATE FACILITIES DISPENSING\r\n    DRUGS BEING REQUIRED TO BE PERMITTED BY THE BOARD OF PHARMACY AND BEING\r\n    REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH OTHER PROVISIONS, SO AS TO EXEMPT THE DEPARTMENT OF\r\n    HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FROM CERTAIN OF THESE REQUIREMENTS; TO AMEND\r\n    SECTION 40-43-86, AS AMENDED, RELATING TO FACILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR PHARMACIES,\r\n    INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT FOR A PHARMACIST IN CHARGE, SO AS TO EXEMPT THE\r\n    DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FROM CERTAIN OF THESE\r\n    REQUIREMENTS; AND BY ADDING SECTION 44-1-215 SO AS TO PERMIT THE DEPARTMENT OF\r\n    HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL TO RETAIN CERTAIN FUNDS DERIVED FROM RADIATION\r\n    SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. \r\n\r\nAs a result of these amendments,\r\n  sections 3 and 4 were added, exempting DHEC from certain pharmacy requirements\r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-43-83, and amending Â§ 44-2-115, to allow DHEC to retain\r\n  certain funds.Â  Respondents and the Attorney General all concede the added\r\n  provisions violate Article III, Â§ 17.Â  We agree.Â  The add-on provisions do not\r\n  deal with the South Carolina Critical Needs Nursing Initiative Act such that\r\n  they are violative of the one-subject provision.Â  \r\nThe question\r\n  remains, however, whether these provisions are severable from the remainder of\r\n  Act 49, inasmuch as it contains no severability clause.Â  Notwithstanding the\r\n  lack of a severability clause, we find the surviving sections of the Critical\r\n  Needs Act may stand alone.Â  \r\nWe have previously held: \r\n\r\n  The test\r\n    for severability is whether the constitutional portion of the statute remains\r\n    complete in itself, wholly independent of that which is rejected, and is of\r\n    such a character that it may fairly be presumed that the legislature would have\r\n    passed it independent of that which conflicts with the constitution. Â When the\r\n    residue of an Act, sans that portion found to be unconstitutional, is capable\r\n    of being executed in accordance with the Legislative intent, independent of the\r\n    rejected portion, the Act as a whole should not be stricken as being in\r\n    violation of a Constitutional Provision.\r\n\r\nSloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. at 439, 608 S.E.2d at 584, citing Joytime\r\n  Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 649, 528 S.E.2d 647,\r\n  654 (1999).Â  Notwithstanding the absence of a severability clause from Act 49,\r\n  the legislative intent is clear, and the purposes of the Act may be complied\r\n  with by upholding the Critical Needs Nursing Initiative Act.Â  Accord Keyserling (one-subject clause is complied with if the title of an act expresses a general\r\n  subject and the body provides the means to facilitate accomplishment of the\r\n  general purpose).Â  Accordingly, the offending portions of Act 49 are hereby\r\n  severed.\r\nb.Â  Act No. 83 \r\n2007 Act No. 83 establishes the South Carolina\r\n  Hydrogen Infrastructure Fund (Â§Â§ 1-4), and the Energy Freedom and Rural\r\n  Development Act (Â§ 10).Â  As initially proposed, Act 83 contained only the\r\n  Hydrogen Infrastructure Act.Â Â  It was amended on May 2, 2007, adding Â§Â§ 5\r\n  through 8 concerning economic impact zone tax credits for qualifying\r\n  investments, amusement park sales-tax exemptions, creating the Board of\r\n  Trustees for the SC Research Authority, and creating the South Carolina Venture\r\n  Capital Authority.[2]Â \r\n  Act 83 was again amended on May 30, 2007, adding Â§Â§ 9 through 18, which created\r\n  the Energy Freedom and Rural Development Act (Â§ 10), and added tax credits for\r\n  alternative fuel usage.Â  We find that Â§Â§ 5, 6 and 8 of Act 83 do not relate to\r\n  the main purpose of the act.Â  Accordingly, those provisions are hereby severed.[3] Â \r\nWe find the\r\n  remaining sections of Act 83 sufficiently related to the goals of promoting\r\n  hydrogen and alternative energy as to fall within the ambit of the Act.Â  Accord Keyserling v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 470 S.E.2d 100 (1996) (Article III,\r\n  Â§ 17 does not preclude legislature from dealing with several branches of one\r\n  general subject in a single act).Â  \r\nc.Â  Act 110\r\nAct 110 is the Research and Development Tax Credit\r\n  Reform Act.Â Â  With the exception of Sections 5 and 57, all of the remaining\r\n  sections of Act 110 have been superseded by Act No. 116.Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  concede that Section 5 of the Act was enacted in violation of the one-subject\r\n  rule; accordingly, it is stricken.Â  The only remaining section of Act 110 which\r\n  was not superseded by Act 116 is section 57, which provides for methane gas tax\r\n  credit.Â  Â We find this section relevant to the stated title of Act 110, the\r\n  Research and Development Tax Credit Reform Act such that it is not in violation\r\n  of the one-subject rule.Â  Â Â \r\nd.Â  Act 116\r\nAct 116 was initially introduced as H3479 to amend Â§\r\n  12-10-80 relating to Job Development Credits.Â  It was amended throughout the\r\n  legislative process and now contains some 70 sections.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  do not point to any specific sections of Act 116 which are violative of the\r\n  â€œone-subject ruleâ€ but contend, instead, that Act 116 relates to a total of 69\r\n  subjects.Â  We find the majority of Act 116 is sufficiently related to the\r\n  subject of raising revenue to withstand a â€œone-subjectâ€ challenge.Â  \r\nAct\r\n  116 contains the following sections:\r\nÂ§ 1-\r\n  the Jobs Tax Credit, multi-business park\r\n  Â§ 2-\r\n  the SC Venture Capital Authority \r\n  Â§\r\n  3-Tourism Infrastructure \r\n  Â§4\r\n  -Exception \r\n  Â§ 5-\r\n  Income Tax Credit \r\n  Â§ 6-\r\n  Corporate license taxÂ \r\n  Â§ 7-\r\n  Fee in Lieu of Taxes \r\n  Â§ 8-\r\n  Jobs tax credit \r\n  Â§ 9-\r\n  Property Tax Exemption \r\n  Â§\r\n  10- Reassessment Postponement \r\n  Â§\r\n  11- Wine Tastings\r\n  Â§\r\n  12- Contested Hearings Open To Public \r\n  Â§\r\n  13- Retail facilities tax credits\r\n  Â§\r\n  14- Definition of â€œindividualâ€\r\n  Â§\r\n  15- Applicability of federal provisions\r\n  Â§ 16- Pass through trade and business income\r\n  Â§\r\n  17- Deductions from taxable income\r\n  Â§\r\n  18- Jobs Tax Credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  19- Jobs Tax Credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  20- Jobs Tax Credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  21- Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  22- Industry Partnership Fund tax credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  23- Solar Installation tax credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  24- Extension for filing return\r\n  Â§\r\n  25- Nonresident seller withholding\r\n  Â§\r\n  26- Nonresident distributee withholding\r\n  Â§\r\n  27- Overpayment of Tax withheld\r\n  Â§\r\n  28- Holding company license fee\r\n  Â§\r\n  29- Exemptions from business license tax\r\n  Â§\r\n  30- Exemptions from sales tax\r\n  Â§\r\n  31- Tax free certificate\r\n  Â§\r\n  32- Credit for tax relief\r\n  Â§\r\n  33- Extension for filing or paying tax\r\n  Â§\r\n  34- Time limits on assessments\r\n  Â§\r\n  35- Penalties for understatement of taxes\r\n  Â§\r\n  36- Disclosure by the department\r\n  Â§\r\n  37- Disclosure by the department\r\n  Â§\r\n  38- Legislative intent\r\n  Â§\r\n  39- Administrative tax process\r\n  Â§\r\n  40- Tax millage increase limits\r\n  Â§\r\n  41- Department determination\r\n  Â§\r\n  42- Powers and duties of department\r\n  Â§\r\n  43- Applicability of federal law\r\n  Â§\r\n  44- Federal laws not adopted\r\n  Â§\r\n  45- Jobs tax credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  46- Small business tax credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  47- Sales tax exemption; construction materials\r\n  Â§\r\n  48- Surety for payment of taxes\r\n  Â§\r\n  49- Disclosure by the department \r\n  Â§\r\n  50- Payment in readily available funds\r\n  Â§\r\n  51- Estimation of tax liability\r\n  Â§ 52- School district reimbursement\r\n  Â§\r\n  53- Tax credit certificates\r\n  Â§\r\n  54- Penalty prohibited\r\n  Â§\r\n  55- Allocation and apportionment of business income\r\n  Â§\r\n  56- Allocation and apportionment of business income\r\n  Â§\r\n  57- Conduct of business in this State\r\n  Â§\r\n  58- Definition of â€œsales factorâ€\r\n  Â§\r\n  59- Income from other sources\r\n  Â§\r\n  60- Computation; apportionment; repeal\r\n  Â§\r\n  61- Authority to invest\r\n  Â§\r\n  62- Sales tax exemption; amusement park\r\n  Â§\r\n  63- Economic impact zone credit\r\n  Â§\r\n  64- Property tax exemption; watercraft\r\n  Â§\r\n  65- Subchapter â€œSâ€ bank shareholders\r\n  Â§\r\n  66- Boats with situs in this State\r\n  Â§\r\n  67- Special source revenue bonds\r\n  Â§\r\n  68- Fund established\r\n  Â§\r\n  69- Severability clause\r\n  Â§\r\n  70- One subject clause\r\n  Â§\r\n  71- Time effective\r\nAs is evident, the majority\r\n  of these sections involve some type of revenue collection and or taxation.Â Â \r\n  Many of the sections amend Title 12 of the S.C. Code, pertaining to taxation.Â Â \r\n  Accordingly, to the extent the various sections of Act 116 are kindred in\r\n  nature, we find the Act does not violate S.C. Const. Art. III, Â§ 17.Â  Sloan\r\n    v. Wilkins, (topics in body of an act must be kindred in nature and have a\r\n  legitimate and natural association).\r\nHowever, there are\r\n  two sections of Act 116 which we find unrelated to the subject of revenue\r\n  raising.Â Â  In particular, Â§ 11 relating to Wine Tastings, and Â§ 68 which\r\n  creates the â€œSouth Carolina Renewable Energy Infrastructure Development Fundâ€\r\n  to provide loans and grants to entities engaged in renewable energy\r\n  production.Â  We conclude these sections are violative of Article III, Â§ 17 and\r\n  hereby strike them.Â  The remainder of Act 116 is upheld.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThose provisions of\r\n  the aforementioned acts which violate the one-subject provision of Article III,\r\n  Â§ 17, are stricken.Â  We uphold the remaining portions of the challenged acts.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BEATTY, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in\r\n  a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s analysis of the\r\n  log-rolling problems raised by these legislative acts, but I adhere to my\r\n  dissenting opinion in Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d 579\r\n  (2005), and would hold that the provisions of these acts that violate Art. III,\r\n  Â§ 17 are not severable.Â  As I stated in Sloan v. Wilkins, severing\r\n  certain provisions of an act neither prevents nor corrects log-rolling, but\r\n  rather creates uncertainty and promotes arbitrary enforcement of the\r\n  one-subject rule.\r\nAccordingly, I\r\n  would hold that the unconstitutional provisions of the legislative acts are not\r\n  severable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decline to address Petitionersâ€™ contention\r\n  that 2007 Act Nos. 130, 136, 142, 143 and 151 constitute special laws in\r\n  violation of South Carolina Constitution, Article VIII, Â§ 7, and Article III, Â§\r\n  34.Â  Petitioners lack standing to challenge those acts.Â  Sloan v. Sanford,\r\n  357 S.C. 431, 593 S.E.2d 470 (2004) (as a general rule, a litigant must have a\r\n  personal stake in the subject matter of the litigation to have standing); Blandon\r\n    v. Coleman, 285 S.C. 472, 330 S.E.2d 298 (1985) (private person may not\r\n  invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative\r\n  action unless he has sustained, or is in immediate danger, of sustaining\r\n  prejudice therefrom).Â  \r\n[2] Â Sections 5, 6 and 8 of Act 83 are repeated\r\n  verbatim as sections 2, 3 and 4, of Act 110, which is discussed below.\r\n[3] Â We note that sections 5 (economic impact zone credit),\r\n  6 (amusement park tax exemption), and 8 (Venture Capital Authority) of Act 83\r\n  were reenacted in Act 116.Â  Inasmuch as Act 83 has been superseded by Act 116,\r\n  the issue is moot.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26507","title":"Michael Scott B. v.

Brown, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26507\r\nHeard May 6, 2008 - Filed June 23, 2008Â Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Richard H. Rhodes, of Burts, Turner, Rhodes and Thompson, of Spartanburg and Joseph K. Maddox, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Petitioner.\r\n        James Fletcher Thompson, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n        Susan A. Fretwell, of Fretwell Law Firm, of Spartanburg, for\r\n          Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael\r\n  Scott B. and Andrea M. (respondents) filed an action in 2004 seeking to\r\n  terminate Melissa M.â€™s (petitionerâ€™s) parental rights (TPR) and seeking to\r\n  adopt petitionerâ€™s two children.Â  After a final hearing in 2006, the family\r\n  court terminated petitionerâ€™s parental rights and granted respondentsâ€™ request\r\n  to adopt the children.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered respondents, the\r\n  ultimate prevailing party, to pay petitionerâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of\r\n  $16,000.Â  The parties cross-appealed to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed the family courtâ€™s TPR order but vacated the award of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Scott B. v. Melissa M., Op. No. 2007-UP-109 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 6, 2007).Â  We granted certiorari solely on the issue of attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner\r\n  is the mother of two minor children, and Respondents are the sister and\r\n  brother-in-law of petitioner.Â  Petitionerâ€™s struggles with depression and drug\r\n  abuse, leading to several suicide attempts and subsequent hospitalizations, were\r\n  the basis for TPR.\r\nShortly after\r\n  respondents filed the TPR action, the family court appointed an attorney to\r\n  represent petitioner.Â  In petitionerâ€™s Answer and Counterclaim, she requested\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees for the defense of the action.Â  \r\nDuring the TPR\r\n  hearing, respondentsâ€™ counsel stated that he did not object to the payment of\r\n  petitionerâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees by a third-party other than respondents.Â Â Â  At the\r\n  conclusion of the TPR hearing, the family court judge granted petitionerâ€™s\r\n  counselâ€™s request to submit an attorneyâ€™s fee affidavit.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court issued its final order in which the family court terminated\r\n  petitionerâ€™s parental rights based on two statutory grounds: S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1572 (4), (6) (Supp. 2005).Â  The family court further determined that TPR\r\n  was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  The order required respondents to pay\r\n  $16,000 for petitionerâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals vacated the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to petitioner that were to be paid\r\n  by respondents, finding that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 (Supp. 2005) provided\r\n  the family court with a basis for awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to a spouse in\r\n  marital litigation, but it did not apply to private actions for TPR.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    Court of Appeals err by vacating the award of attorneyâ€™s fees?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues the Court of Appeals erred in vacating the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nAttorneyâ€™s fees are\r\n  not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.Â  S.C. Dept. of\r\n    Soc. Serv. v. Tharp, 312 S.C. 243, 245, 439 S.E.2d 854, 856 (1994).Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals erred by holding that Â§ 20-7-420 does not provide a statutory basis to\r\n  award attorneyâ€™s fees in a private action for TPR.[1]Â \r\n  Section 20-7-420(4) provides the family court with jurisdiction to hear and\r\n  determine private actions for TPR.Â  Additionally, Â§ 20-7-420(38) provides that\r\n  â€œ[s]uit money, including attorneyâ€™s fees, may be assessed for or against a\r\n  party to an action brought in or subject to the jurisdiction of the family\r\n  court.â€Â  Section 20-7-420(38) grants the family court general jurisdiction to\r\n  award attorneyâ€™s fees, and because there is no specific statute precluding attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees in a TPR action instituted by a private party, the family court did not err\r\n  in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See Spartanburg County Dept. of Soc.\r\n    Serv. v. Little, 309 S.C. 122, 420 S.E.2d 499 (1992) (Section 20-7-420(38)\r\n  grants family court general authority to award attorneyâ€™s fees against parties\r\n  subject to the courtâ€™s jurisdiction, but a more specific statute precluding\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees may determine the authority to award fees). \r\nRespondents argue\r\n  that even if there was statutory authority to award petitionerâ€™s attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees, the family court abused its discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to\r\n  award attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  judge, and the award will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C. 229, 656 S.E.2d 737 (2008).Â \r\n  The factors used to determine a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee are: (1) the nature,\r\n  extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the\r\n  case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation;\r\n  (5) beneficial results obtained; (6) customary legal fees for similar\r\n  services.Â  Id.Â  (citing Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 313 (1991)).\r\nAll six Glasscock factors support an award of attorneyâ€™s fees to petitioner.Â  This was a\r\n  difficult case in which petitioner strongly fought the termination of her\r\n  parental rights, and her appointed attorney devoted nearly two years to the\r\n  case.Â  The trial judge, in his order, commended petitionerâ€™s attorney for serving\r\n  his clientâ€™s interests well.Â  Furthermore, respondents do not challenge the\r\n  reasonableness of the amount of fees requested by petitionerâ€™s counsel.\r\nRespondentsâ€™\r\n  main objections to the award of attorneyâ€™s fees are the lack of a beneficial\r\n  result for the petitioner and their assertion that petitioner has the ability\r\n  to pay the fees.Â  As to the beneficial result, although petitioner did not\r\n  ultimately prevail on the TPR action, she was able to procure visitation rights\r\n  with her children while the TPR/adoption proceedings were pending.[2]Â \r\n  Even though petitioner had her parental rights terminated, her failure to\r\n  ultimately prevail, standing alone, does not preclude an award of attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees.Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 624 S.E.2d 643 (2006). Â \r\nAs\r\n  to petitionerâ€™s ability to pay the fees, she was unemployed, being treated for\r\n  depression, and had just been discharged from the hospital when the action was\r\n  filed.Â  She had not worked since April 2004, and after being discharged from a\r\n  mental health facility and subsequently enrolling in a technical college,\r\n  petitioner did not resume full-time employment until December 2005.Â  The record\r\n  supports the finding that in light of petitionerâ€™s financial difficulties,\r\n  respondents should be responsible for petitionerâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  a review of the Glasscock factors weighs in favor of awarding petitioner\r\n  her attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals erred in finding no statutory authority existed under Â§\r\n  20-7-420 to support an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Furthermore, the attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees award was proper.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondents concede that statutory authority exists\r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n[2] The children had been removed from the home following\r\n  an emergency hearing held after the filing of the TPR/adoption action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26508","title":"Matthew A.

Tort Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 15-78-10 et seq.Â Â  The plaintiffs and SCDOT appeal.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThese\r\n  cases arise out of an automobile accident which occurred on January 4, 2000, on\r\n  Interstate 77 (I-77) in Columbia, between the Boyden Arbor overpass and Percival Road.Â  At 3:10 p.m., a Ford Expedition driven by Barry Harp, while heading north on\r\n  I-77, hydroplaned and crossed the center median into the southboundÂ  lanes,\r\n  striking cars driven by Deborah Giannini, and Tracey Golden.Â  Roderic Bradley\r\n  was a passenger in the vehicle driven by Golden.Â  Giannini was killed; Golden\r\n  and Bradley suffered serious bodily injuries.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  plaintiffs filed tort claim actions alleging SCDOT was negligent in failing to\r\n  install median barriers which could have prevented Harpâ€™s vehicle from crossing\r\n  over into the southbound lane of traffic.Â Â  SCDOT answered and claimed it was\r\n  immune from liability under the S.C. Tort Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60\r\n  (15).Â  The trial court denied SCDOTâ€™s motions for directed verdict, and the\r\n  case proceeded to trial.Â  The jury returned verdicts of $1.5 million dollars to\r\n  the estate of Giannini, $745,000 to Golden, and $645,000 to Bradley.Â  SCDOT\r\n  filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and to reduce the\r\n  verdicts in accordance with the statutory limitations of liability set forth by\r\n  the Tort Claims Act.Â  The trial court denied JNOV but reduced the verdicts to\r\n  $200,000 for each plaintiff.Â  SCDOT and the plaintiffs appeal.Â Â \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\nSCDOT Appeal:\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Did the trial court err in denying SCDOTâ€™s motions for\r\n    directed verdict and JNOV?\r\n    2.Â  Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury\r\n    regarding the non-taxability of their verdict?\r\n\r\nPlaintiffsâ€™\r\n  Appeal:\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Does the Tort Claims Actâ€™s limitation of recovery to $600,000\r\n    total per occurrence violate equal protection?\r\n    2.Â  Did the General Assembly violate the â€œone subjectâ€ rule of\r\n    S.C. Const., Art. III, Â§ 17 by â€œlogrollingâ€ or â€œbobtailingâ€ the reenactment of\r\n    statutory caps in the 1994 and 1997 Appropriations Acts?Â  \r\n\r\nPlaintiff Gianniniâ€™s Appeal:\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Did the trial court err in apportioning the $600,000 verdict\r\n    equally among the three plaintiffs, as opposed to apportioning it in proportion\r\n    to the verdicts?\r\n\r\n1.Â Â  SCDOT APPEAL - JNOV\r\nSCDOT\r\n  contends the trial court erred in denying its motions for a directed verdict\r\n  and JNOV on numerous grounds.Â  It contends a) it did not owe a duty to install\r\n  a median barrier where the accident occurred, b) it was entitled to\r\n  design/discretionary immunity, and c) there is no evidence that the absence of\r\n  a median barrier was the proximate cause of the accident.Â Â  We disagree.Â  We\r\n  find these matters were properly submitted to a jury.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  SCDOT asserts that S.C. Code Â§ 15-78-60(15) shields it from liability.Â  Section\r\n  15-78-60(15) sets forth exceptions to the stateâ€™s waiver of sovereign immunity,\r\n  stating, in pertinent part, that a governmental entity is not liable for loss\r\n  resulting from: \r\n\r\n  (15) absence, condition or malfunction. . . of any. . . median\r\n    barrier unless the absence, condition, or malfunction is not corrected by the\r\n    governmental entity responsible for its maintenance within a reasonable time\r\n    after actual or constructive notice. . . . Nothing in this item gives rise to\r\n    liability arising from a failure of any governmental entity to initially place\r\n    any of the above signs, signals, warning devices, guardrails, or median\r\n    barriers when the failure is the result of a discretionary act of the\r\n    governmental entity. . . .Â  Governmental entities are not liable for the design\r\n    of highways and other public ways. . . .Â  \r\n\r\nSCDOTÂ \r\n  contends it owed no duty because its actions were the result of the design of\r\n  the highway, such that it is immune from liability.Â Â  It cites Summer v.\r\n    Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997), in support of its\r\n  contention.Â Â  Summer is inapposite.Â  In Summer, we held SCDOTâ€™s\r\n  insertion of wedging to correct bumps in an intersection which was under\r\n  construction was essentially a claim of defective construction, such that the\r\n  plaintiff had no claim because SCDOT was entitled to design immunity.Â  The\r\n  rationale for our holding in Summer was that the intersection was still\r\n  in the process of being constructed. \r\nUnlike Summer, the plaintiffs here claim that SCDOT failed\r\n  to take proper measures after notice of an existing hazard.Â  Here, the portion\r\n  of I-77 where the accident occurred was built in 1995, and there had been\r\n  several crossover accidents within two miles of this accident in which two\r\n  people had been killed; the accidents had been publicized by local media.Â  This\r\n  is not a claim of defective construction but, rather, one of failure to take\r\n  corrective action subsequent to notice of a defect.Â  This case is more\r\n  analogous to Wooten v. SCDOT, 333 S.C. 464, 511 S.E.2d 355 (1999).Â  \r\nIn Wooten, we affirmed the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling that\r\n  although SCDOT has design immunity, such immunity does not extend to\r\n  maintenance issues after the DOT has notice of a hazardous condition.Â  333 S.C.\r\n  at 467-468, 511 S.E.2d at 357.Â  In Wooten, the plaintiffs claimed SCDOT\r\n  was negligent in failing to provide traffic lights at an intersection which would\r\n  allow a pedestrian ample time to cross the street.Â  The Court of Appeals held\r\n  that although DOT initially had design immunity, such immunity was not\r\n  â€œperpetual.â€Â  The Court of Appeals held that once DOT had notice the\r\n  intersection was hazardous, it was no longer immune from liability.Â  328 S.C.\r\n  36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  On appeal, this Court affirmed as modified,\r\n  adopting the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the immunity provision regarding signs\r\n  and signals was the more specific one applicable to the case, such that a jury\r\n  issue was presented as to whether SCDOT was liable.Â  Wooten v. SCDOT,\r\n  333 S.C. at 468-469, 511 S.E.2d at 357-358 (1999).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find the trial[1] court properly denied SCDOTâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV on the\r\n  issue of whether it breached a duty to the Plaintiffs in failing to install\r\n  median barriers after notice of cross over accidents along that stretch of\r\n  I-77.Â  \r\nSCDOT also\r\n  asserts it was entitled to a directed verdict as there was no evidence the\r\n  absence of a median barrier proximately caused the accident.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nPlaintiffs\r\n  presented the deposition testimony of Darcy Sullivan, a highway transportation\r\n  engineer.Â  Sullivan testified that it was feasible to install three-cable\r\n  median barriers prior to January 2000, and that such a barrier would have\r\n  entrapped or redirected the tires of a car hitting it.Â  When asked if he had an\r\n  opinion to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty whether the collision\r\n  in this case most probably could have been prevented, he testified, â€œI think it\r\n  is highly likely that the crossover would have been prevented.Â  Certainly, the\r\n  vehicle would have been redirected to some extent.Â  And although there may have\r\n  been some subsequent crash, it would not have been the crash that occurred.Â \r\n  The trajectory of the Harp vehicle would have been modified enough that it\r\n  simply would not have happened as it did.â€Â  \r\nThis\r\n  evidence was sufficient to submit the issue to the jury, and any defects in\r\n  Sullivanâ€™s testimony were matters of weight for the jury.Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l\r\n    Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005)\r\n  (qualification of an expert witness and the admissibility of the expertâ€™s\r\n  testimony are matters within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion); State v. White,\r\n  372 S.C. 364, 642 S.E.2d 607 (Ct. App. 2007)(defects in the amount and quality\r\n  of the expertâ€™s education or experience go to the weight to be accorded the\r\n  expertâ€™s testimony and not to its admissibility).Â Â  JNOV was properly denied on\r\n  the issue of proximate cause.\r\n\r\n2.Â  JURY INSTRUCTION ON TAXABILITY\r\nSCDOT next\r\n  asserts the trial court committed error in refusing to instruct the jury that\r\n  any award it gave would not be subject to income taxes, and that it was not to\r\n  consider taxes in fixing the amount of an award.Â  It cites for this proposition\r\n  a 1952 Missouri case, Dempsey v. Thompson, 363 Mo. 339, 251 S.W.2d 42\r\n  (1952).Â  Dempsey is not controlling here.\r\nWe find\r\n  no South Carolina cases suggesting that a jury instruction on income tax\r\n  consequences is appropriate.Â Â  On the contrary, such a charge is prohibited by\r\n  the collateral source rule.Â  See e.g., New Found Baptist Church v.\r\n    Davis, 257 S.C. 443, 186 S.E.2d 247 (1972); Young v. Warr, 252 S.C.\r\n  179, 165 S.E.2d 797 (1969) (tortfeasor has no right to any mitigation of\r\n  damages because of payments or compensation received by the injured person from\r\n  a source wholly independent of the wrongdoer); 11 S.C. Juris. Damages Â§\r\n  11 (1992); see 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages Â§Â§ 570-90, at 641-56 (1988)\r\n  (tortfeasor cannot take advantage of payments or services rendered by a\r\n  collateral source for the plaintiff's benefit, irrespective of whether the\r\n  source is an insurance company, an employer, a family member, or other source).Â \r\n  We find no basis upon which to hold such a charge warranted under S.C. law.[2] \r\nThe\r\n  trial court committed no error in refusing the requested charge.Â  Moreover, we\r\n  find no conceivable prejudice here, in light of the size of the verdicts and\r\n  the fact that the verdicts were reduced in accordance with the Tort Claims Act\r\n  caps.\r\n\r\nPLAINTIFFSâ€™ APPEAL: \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  EQUAL PROTECTION\r\nPlaintiffs\r\n  Giannini, Golden and Bradley contend the Tort Claims Actâ€™s limitation to a\r\n  $600,000 aggregate verdict violates equal protection.Â  We disagree. \r\n The\r\n  jury awarded verdicts of $1.5 million (Giannini estate), $745,000 (Golden), and\r\n  $645,000 (Bradley).Â Â  The trial court reduced the verdicts to a total of\r\n  $600,000 pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120(2), which provides â€œ[e]xcept as\r\n  provided in Section 15-8-120(a)(4), the total sum recovered hereunder arising\r\n  out of a single occurrence shall not exceed six hundred thousand dollars\r\n  regardless of the number of agencies or political subdivisions or claims or\r\n  actions involved.â€Â  \r\n This\r\n  Court has previously addressed the individual statutory caps as set forth in\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120(a), which provides a limitation on damages to\r\n  $300,000 because of â€œloss arising from a single occurrence regardless of the\r\n  number of agencies or political subdivisions involved.â€Â  In Wright v.\r\n    Colleton County, 301 S.C. 282, 291-292, 391 S.E.2d 564, 570 (1990), we\r\n  upheld the $300,000 cap against an equal protection challenge, stating:\r\n\r\n  the limitation bears a reasonable relationship to the legislative\r\n    objectives as expressed in Section 15-78-20(a) of relieving the government from\r\n    hardships of unlimited and unqualified liability and preserving the finite\r\n    assets of governmental entities which are needed for an effective and efficient\r\n    government. The limitations set forth in the statute rest on a reasonable basis\r\n    and are not arbitrary in that the legislature has balanced the needs for\r\n    services and demand for reasonable taxes against the fair reimbursement of\r\n    injured tort victims.Â  Finally, we find that the damage limitation provisions\r\n    apply to similar plaintiffs in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nWe concluded in Wright that there was no equal protection violation because the same monetary cap\r\n  applies equally to the entire class of plaintiffs.Â  Id.\r\nPlaintiffs\r\n  assert the class here, tort victims injured by the state, are not treated the\r\n  same under the statute, because the dollar amount may vary and be limited by\r\n  the amount of persons injured in an occurrence.Â  We disagree.Â Â  We find the\r\n  limitation accords with the stated legislative purpose of preserving finite\r\n  governmental assets, and treats similar plaintiffs in a similar manner.Â  \r\nAs we noted in Foster v. SC Depâ€™t of Transp., 306 S.C. 519,\r\n  413 S.E.2d 31 (1992), the fact that a classification results in some inequity\r\n  does not render it in violation of the Constitution.Â  In Foster, we\r\n  upheld higher liability limits for physicians and dentists against an equal\r\n  protection challenge.Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  the Legislatureâ€™s aggregate limitation on liability is supported by a rational\r\n  basis such that there is no equal protection violation.Â  Accord Wilson\r\n    v. Gipson, 753 P.2d 1349 (OK 1998) (several children injured and five\r\n  killed in explosion of water heater at a public school; court upheld aggregate\r\n  limitation of $300,000 liability against equal protection challenge, awarding\r\n  $18,221 to parents of children killed, and remainder to injured children);Â  Lee\r\n    v. Colorado Department of Health, 718 P.2d 221 (Colo.1986) (legislative\r\n  decision to limit the public entityâ€™s liability to $150,000 for any injury to\r\n  one person and $400,000 for any injury to two or more persons in a single\r\n  occurrence withstood equal protection).\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  ONE SUBJECT/BOBTAILING\r\nGiannini,\r\n  Bradley and Golden next assert the Legislatureâ€™s re-enactment of the statutory\r\n  tort claims caps in 1994 and 1997 violate S.C. Const., Art. III Â§ 17 by\r\n  â€œlogrollingâ€ or â€œbobtailingâ€ provisions into an appropriations act.Â  We disagree.\r\n S.C.\r\n  CONST. Art. III, Â§ 17 requires that â€œEvery Act or resolution having the force\r\n  of law shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the\r\n  title.â€Â  \r\nAs\r\n  recently noted by this Court:\r\n\r\n  The purpose of Article III, Â§ 17 is (1) to apprise the members of\r\n    the General Assembly of the contents of an act by reading the title, (2)\r\n    prevent legislative log-rolling and (3) inform the people of the state of the\r\n    matters with which the General Assembly concerns itself. . . . Article III, Â§\r\n    17 is to be liberally construed so as to uphold an Act if practicable.Â \r\n    Doubtful or close cases are to be resolved in favor of upholding an Actâ€™s\r\n    validity.Â  Article III, Â§ 17 does not preclude the legislature from dealing\r\n    with several branches of one general subject in a single act. Â It is complied\r\n    with if the title of an act expresses a general subject and the body provides\r\n    the means to facilitate accomplishment of the general purpose. Â However,\r\n    Article III, section 17 requires â€˜the topics in the body of the act [be]\r\n    kindred in nature and hav[e] a legitimate and natural association with the\r\n    subject of the title,â€™ and that the title conveys â€˜reasonable notice of the\r\n    subject matter to the legislature and the public.â€™\r\n\r\nSloan v.\r\n  Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430,\r\n  608 S.E.2d 579 (2005) (emphasis supplied, internal citations omitted).Â \r\n  Plaintiffs assert the reenactments violate the one-subject rule as they do not\r\n  inherently relate to the raising and spending of tax monies.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  recognized in Town of Hilton Head v. Morris, 324 S.C. 30, 484 S.E.2d\r\n  104, 107 (1997) that â€œa measure enacted as part of a general appropriations act\r\n  does not violate Article III, Â§ 17, if it reasonably and inherently relates to\r\n  the raising and spending of tax monies.â€Â  See also Keyserling v.\r\n    Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 470 S.E.2d 100 (1996) (provisions of appropriations\r\n  act which created negotiating committee to establish new regional radioactive\r\n  waste disposal compact and which repealed statute adopting prior compact were\r\n  related to raising and spending of revenues and, thus, complied with\r\n  one-subject rule); Hercules v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 274 S.C. 137,\r\n  262 S.E.2d 45 (1980) (statute providing for suspension of the statute of limitations\r\n  on tax assessment if a corporate taxpayer fails to give the Tax Commission\r\n  notice of an IRS examination was germane to the General Appropriations Act in\r\n  which it was contained and thus did not violate the constitutional requirement\r\n  that every act relate to but one subject). \r\nHere,\r\n  1994 Act No. 497, lists in its title that the act is â€œTO PROVIDE THAT CERTAIN\r\n  PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 15-78-100 AND 15-78-120 OF THE 1976 CODE ARE REENACTED\r\n  AND MADE RETROACTIVE TO APRIL 5, 1988.â€Â  Further, Part 2, Â§ 107 of the\r\n  Appropriations Act amends the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act\r\n  to make it inapplicable to government agencies, and reinstates the Tort Claims\r\n  Caps set forth in Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1).Â  The 1997 Appropriations Act, 1997 Act No.\r\n  155, Part II, Â§ 55, similarly reenacts the $500,000 cap set forth in Â§\r\n  15-78-120(a)(2).Â Â  The statutory reenactments reasonably and inherently relate\r\n  to the raising and spending of tax monies.Â  Town of Hilton Head v. Morris.Â \r\n  Accordingly, reenactment of the caps does not violate Article III, Â§ 17.Â  \r\nGIANNINIâ€™S\r\n  APPEAL: \r\n1.Â  APPORTIONMENT OF VERDICT\r\nFinally,\r\n  Giannini asserts the trial court erred in apportioning the verdict equally\r\n  among the Plaintiffs, rather than apportioning it in accordance with the\r\n  verdicts awarded to each plaintiff.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1) limits an individualâ€™s recovery against\r\n  a government agency to $300,000 for a loss arising from a single occurrence.Â \r\n  Section 15-78-120(a)(2) further limits the total sum recoverable from a single\r\n  occurrence to $600,000 regardless of the number of agencies or political\r\n  subdivisions or claims or actions involved.Â  The trial court determined that,\r\n  since each of the verdicts exceeded $300,000, each plaintiffâ€™s verdict would\r\n  each be reduced to $200,000.Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  no error in the trial courtâ€™s apportionment.Â  If the Legislature had intended\r\n  for the $600,000 aggregate cap to be divided in proportion to the verdicts\r\n  awarded to each plaintiff, it could have said so.Â  State v. Curtis, 356\r\n  S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004) (if Legislature had intended certain result in\r\n  a statute it would have said so).Â Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s ruling is\r\n  affirmed.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nMOORE, J.,\r\n  concurs.Â  BEATTY, J., concurring in a separate opinion. Â PLEICONES, J.\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  I concur in the majority\r\n  opinion; however, I write separately to address the discretionary immunity\r\n  issue.[3]Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  my view, discretionary immunity viability is equal to that of design immunity,\r\n  neither is perpetual. See Wooten ex rel. Wooten v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 467-68, 511 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1999) (affirming as\r\n  modified the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that â€œdesign immunity is not perpetual.Â \r\n  Once the Department of Transportation had notice of a hazardous condition, it\r\n  was no longer immune from liabilityâ€).\r\nSection\r\n  15-78-60(15) affords SCDOT discretionary immunity in the failure to initially place median barriers.Â  This section provides, in pertinent part, that the\r\n  governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:\r\n\r\n  (15) absence,\r\n    condition, or malfunction of any sign, signal, warning device,\r\n    illumination device, guardrail, or median barrier unless the absence,\r\n    condition, or malfunction is not corrected by the governmental entity\r\n      responsible for its maintenance within a reasonable time after actual or\r\n      constructive notice. Governmental entities are not liable for the removal\r\n    or destruction of signs, signals, warning devices, guardrails, or median barriers\r\n    by third parties except on failure of the political subdivision to correct them\r\n    within a reasonable time after actual or constructive notice. Nothing in\r\n      this item gives rise to liability arising from a failure of any\r\n    governmental entity to initially place any of the above signs, signals,\r\n    warning devices, guardrails, or median barriers when the failure is\r\n      the result of a discretionary act of the governmental entity.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(15)\r\n  (2005)(emphasis added).Â  \r\nâ€œDiscretionary immunity is contingent on proof the government\r\n  entity, faced with alternatives, actually weighed competing considerations and\r\n  made a conscious choice using accepted professional standards.â€ Â Wooten ex\r\n    rel. Wooten v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 468, 511 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1999).\r\nThe\r\n  finite viability of discretionary immunity is evident in the statute itself.Â \r\n  The statute uses the temporal word initially indicating that the\r\n  immunity for the failure to initially place median barriers terminates after\r\n  notice of a hazardous condition.Â  In other words, SCDOT gets a free pass on the\r\n  initial claim for damages occurring before SCDOT receives notice of a hazardous\r\n  condition if it actually exercised discretion in failing to initially place\r\n  median barriers.Â  After notice, SCDOT is required to remedy the hazardous\r\n  condition within a reasonable time.\r\nI\r\n  agree with the dissent that the exercise of discretion includes the right to be\r\n  wrong but the right to be wrong is not perpetual.Â  The SCDOT exercised\r\n  discretion not to place median barriers when I-77 was constructed and opened to\r\n  traffic.[4]Â \r\n  SCDOT is entitled to immunity for that decision because it related to the initial placement of median barriers.Â  Subsequent to the initial decision, SCDOT\r\n  received notice of cross-over accidents and the existence of hazardous\r\n  conditions.Â  Once SCDOT was put on notice, the first sentence in section\r\n  15-78-60(15) required SCDOT to correct the condition within a reasonable time. See Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor,\r\n    Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 396, 520 S.E.2d 142, 154 (1999)\r\n  (â€œWhile provisions establishing limitations upon and exemptions from liability\r\n  of a governmental entity must be liberally construed to limit liability, we\r\n  also must presume in construing a statute that the Legislature did not intend\r\n  to perform a futile thing.â€).Â  \r\nSection\r\n  15-78-60(15) does not grant discretionary immunity every time SCDOT attempts to\r\n  correct a hazardous condition.\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, it was up to the jury to determine if SCDOT corrected the\r\n  hazardous condition within a reasonable time as required by section\r\n  15-78-60(15).\r\nI\r\n  would affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â Â Â Â Â Â  I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  In my opinion, the trial court should have granted SCDOTâ€™s motion for\r\n  directed verdict, and I would not address the other issues raised by the\r\n  parties.[5]\r\nI\r\n  am troubled by the majorityâ€™s analysis of the Tort Claims Actâ€™s immunity\r\n  provisions applicable to SCDOT.Â  First, the majority fails to adequately\r\n  address SCDOTâ€™s claim that it did not owe plaintiffs a duty to install median\r\n  barriers.Â  The majority instead jumps ahead to the immunity issue under the\r\n  Tort Claims Act.Â  While it is clear that SCDOT has a duty to plan, construct,\r\n  maintain, and operate the stateâ€™s highways,[6]Â \r\n  I believe the majority opinion improperly implies that a duty may arise simply\r\n  because an exception to the Stateâ€™s waiver of sovereign immunity does not exist\r\n  in the Tort Claims Act.Â  Cf. Arthurs ex rel. Est. of Munn v. Aiken\r\n    County, 346 S.C. 97, 105, 551 S.E.2d 579, 583 (2001) (existence of a duty,\r\n  as well as other elements of negligence, must be shown before reaching\r\n  immunities issue under the Tort Claims Act).\r\nPerhaps more\r\n  disconcerting is the majority opinionâ€™s lack of any discussion of discretionary\r\n  immunity.Â  Discretionary immunity is different from design immunity, and SCDOT\r\n  argues it is entitled to both.Â  Design immunity gives SCDOT absolute immunity\r\n  for liability arising from the design of highways and public ways.Â  Wooten\r\n    ex rel. Wooten v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 511 S.E.2d 355\r\n  (1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(15).Â  However, design immunity is not\r\n  perpetual, and once the governmental entity receives notice of a hazardous\r\n  condition, it may no longer invoke design immunity as an absolute shield for\r\n  liability.Â  Id.[7]Â \r\n  Although an entity may lose design immunity, it may still be immune from\r\n  liability if it exercises discretion when faced with actual or constructive\r\n  knowledge of a hazardous condition. \r\nIn Wooten,\r\n  this Court explicitly stated that the design immunity provision of Â§\r\n  15-78-60(15) did not control that case; the more specific clause providing\r\n  discretionary immunity for the initial placement of traffic signals was the\r\n  applicable immunity provision.Â  Likewise, in this case, the pertinent portion\r\n  of Â§ 15-78-60(15) is the part that specifically provides discretionary immunity\r\n  for the initial placement of cable median barriers.Â  The majority appears to\r\n  acknowledge this correlation, but unlike in Wooten, it does not analyze\r\n  whether SCDOTâ€™s actions after it received notice of the dangerous condition\r\n  entitle SCDOT to discretionary immunity.Â  I would hold that SCDOT is entitled\r\n  to discretionary immunity.Â  \r\nDiscretionary\r\n  immunity is contingent on proof the government entity, faced with alternatives,\r\n  actually weighed competing considerations and made a conscious choice. Â Further,\r\n  the entity must establish, in weighing the competing considerations and\r\n  alternatives, it utilized accepted professional standards appropriate to\r\n  resolve the issue. Â Strange v. S.C. Dept. of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp.,\r\n  314 S.C. 427, 429, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994). Â The governmental entity bears\r\n  the burden of establishing discretionary immunity as an affirmative defense.Â  Niver\r\n    v. S.C. Dept. of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 302 S.C. 461, 463, 395 S.E.2d\r\n  728, 730 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  The provisions of the Tort Claims Act that establish\r\n  limitations on and exemptions to the liability of the State must be liberally\r\n  construed in favor of limiting the liability of the State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-20(f) (Supp. 2005).\r\nThere\r\n  is no question that SCDOT weighed competing economic and environmental\r\n  considerations, in addition to following accepted professional standards\r\n  promulgated by the federal government and the American Assocation of State\r\n  Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), when it decided not to place\r\n  median barriers on I-77 when it opened in 1995.Â  After SCDOT received notice in\r\n  1997 of several median crossover accidents in the vicinity of the accident in\r\n  this case, SCDOT added diagonal yellow lines with raised reflectors to the\r\n  highway shoulders that bordered the median.Â  This was done to reduce crossover\r\n  accidents by decreasing the possibility that motorists would drift into the\r\n  median.\r\nEven\r\n  though the placement of these raised markers significantly decreased the number\r\n  of accidents within a one-mile radius[8] of this accident site, SCDOT began gathering information in 1999 concerning\r\n  median widths, accident history, average daily traffic, etc., in order to\r\n  prioritize and secure funding for installation of median barriers.Â  This\r\n  project was underway when this accident occurred in January 2000, and the first\r\n  median cable barriers were installed by December 2000.Â  The record clearly\r\n  shows that SCDOT constantly weighed its options in an attempt to minimize the\r\n  possibility of crossover accidents on this stretch of I-77.Â  Simply because\r\n  there was disagreement between each sideâ€™s experts as to whether discretion was properly exercised does not preclude discretionary immunity for SCDOT.Â \r\n  In other words, the exercise of discretion includes the right to be wrong.Â  McCall\r\n    v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985), superseded by statute as\r\n      recognized in Murphy v. Richland Mem. Hosp., 317 S.C. 560, 455\r\n  S.E.2d 688 (1995).\r\nIn\r\n  my opinion, SCDOT was entitled to discretionary immunity because it is\r\n  undisputed that it exercised discretion in maintaining the area of I-77 where\r\n  this accident occurred.Â  SCDOT contemplated its alternatives pursuant to the\r\n  relevant AASHTO regulations and federal standards, and it made a conscious effort\r\n  to keep this interstate as safe as possible in light of its options.Â \r\n  Accordingly, I would reverse.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The dissent is â€œdisconcertedâ€ by our lack of\r\n  discussion of discretionary immunity.Â  It contends SCDOT is entitled to discretionary\r\n  immunity as a matter of law, because there is evidence in the record that SCDOT\r\n  took some action after notice of the accidents.Â  Contrary to the dissentâ€™s\r\n  contention, Â§ 15-78-60(15) provides discretionary immunity only for the\r\n  â€œfailure of any governmental entity to initially place . . . signs, signals,\r\n  warning devices, guardrails, or median barriers when the failure is the result\r\n  of a discretionary act of the governmental entity.â€Â  (Emphasis supplied).Â Â  The\r\n  dissent correctly points out that, in exercising this initial discretion as to\r\n  whether to place median barriers or guard rails, the exercise of such\r\n  discretion includes the right to be wrong.Â Â  McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C.\r\n  243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985).Â  \r\nHowever, the\r\n  exercise of this discretion in the design of highways is not absolute.Â  It is\r\n  subject to the requirement that the â€œabsence, condition, or malfunction [be]\r\n  corrected by the governmental entity responsible for its maintenance within\r\n    a reasonable time after actual or constructive notice.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-60(15).Â  (Emphasis supplied). Â Wooten, supra.Â Â  It is undisputed that SCDOT was on notice of fatal\r\n  highway cross over accidents by 1997.Â  It nonetheless failed to install median\r\n  barriers until December 2000, some eleven months after the accident in this\r\n  case.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  dissent points to the fact that diagonal yellow lines were placed in the\r\n  shoulders of the highway in 1998, thereby evincing an exercise of discretion\r\n  which entitles SCDOT to immunity as a matter of law.Â  On the contrary, when\r\n  cross-examined, SCDOTâ€™s own expert testified that the reason for installation\r\n  of these lines was that the shoulder lane was extremely wide, and the lines\r\n  were placed there to delineate that this was not supposed to be a travel lane\r\n  for drivers.Â  The lines were â€œnot meant to deal with the situation of a car in\r\n  the normal travel lane losing control, leaving the roadway, and crossing in and\r\n  over the median.â€Â  We find a jury question was presented as to whether SCDOT\r\n  properly took corrective action after notice of the crossover accidents was\r\n  properly submitted to the jury.Â  Accord Wooten (whether SCDOT\r\n  complied with appropriate professional standard was at least a jury issue); Pike\r\n    v. SC Depâ€™t of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 540 S.E.2d 87 (2000) (holding burden\r\n  of persuasion to establish discretionary immunity is on governmental agency,\r\n  and the standard is inherently factual; SCDOT may not shield itself from\r\n  liability as a matter of law by merely creating an issue of fact).Â  \r\n[2]Â  SCDOT cites a United State Supreme Court\r\n  decision upholding such a charge.Â  Norfolk &amp; W. Ry v. Liepelt,\r\n  444 U.S. 490 (1980).Â  However, Liepelt involved a wrongful death action\r\n  brought under Federal Employers' Liability Act in which it was held that\r\n  evidence to show effect of income taxes on decedentâ€™s estimated future earnings\r\n  was admissible at trial.Â  Here, there was no evidence of potential tax\r\n  liability adduced at trial, and the trial court advised SCDOT that if the jury\r\n  asked about it, he would address the taxation issue.Â  \r\n[3] Â SCDOT moved for a directed verdict and JNOV on the ground that it was entitled\r\n  to design immunity and for discretionary immunity under section 15-78-60(15).\r\n[4] Â SCDOT was entitled to both design and discretionary immunity at that time.\r\n[5] While there would be no need to address the remaining issues should we find\r\n  SCDOT should have been granted a directed verdict, I note that I agree with the\r\n  majorityâ€™s conclusions on the remaining questions except for the verdict\r\n  apportionment.Â  I would hold that the trial court erred by not apportioning the\r\n  $600,000 statutory cap in proportion to the actual verdicts returned by the\r\n  jury.Â  Additionally, I believe the enrolled bill rule clearly disposes\r\n  plaintiffsâ€™ bobtailing claim.Â  Med. Socy. of S.C. v. Med. U. of S.C.,\r\n  334 S.C. 270, 278, 513 S.E.2d 352, 356 (1999) (enrolled bill rule provides that\r\n  an act ratified by the General Assembly, approved by the Governor, and enrolled\r\n  in the office of the Secretary of State is conclusively presumed to have been\r\n  properly passed and is not subject to impeachment by evidence outside the act\r\n  to show it was not passed in compliance with law).\r\n[6] S.C.

Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716\r\n  (2000).\r\n[7] But cf. Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 43, 492 S.E.2d 55, 59\r\n  (1997) (holding â€œ[e]ven if the Highway Department was on notice the design of\r\n  the intersection was dangerous, the Highway Department was immune from suit for\r\n  negligent design.â€).Â  Summer can be distinguished by the fact that the\r\n  injury in Summer occurred while the intersection was still under\r\n  construction, thus preserving design immunity.\r\n[8] Given the specific locations involved in tracking highway accidents, it is\r\n  important to note that SCDOT had tracked the accident reports for I-77, and\r\n  between 1995 and 1999, no median cross-over accidents occurred within 1,500\r\n  feet of the site where this accident occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26509","title":"American Credit v.

Player, Jr., of Player &amp; McMillan, of Sumter, for appellant.\r\n        William\r\n          Bailey Woods, of Woods Law Firm, of Lexington, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  MOORE:Â  Appellant (American Credit)\r\n  filed an action claiming respondent (Nationwide) acted in bad faith by failing\r\n  to pay the money due under an insurance policy.Â  Nationwide answered that any\r\n  claim brought by American Credit would be subject to the Loss Payable Clause of\r\n  the policy and that this Clause denies coverage to American Credit.Â  The\r\n  magistrate court granted Nationwideâ€™s motion for a directed verdict and the\r\n  circuit court affirmed.Â  We now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe insured was the\r\n  owner of a 1998 Nissan Altima automobile which was financed by American\r\n  Credit.Â  The automobile was insured with Nationwide for comprehensive and\r\n  collision coverages, with the insured being shown as the policyholder and with\r\n  American Credit as the lienholder.Â  The automobile was involved in a collision\r\n  in Connecticut, which was caused by the driver of another automobile.Â  Damages\r\n  resulted in the amount of $1,801.67.Â  Allstate, the liability insurance carrier\r\n  of the at-fault motorist, paid to the insured a sum of money sufficient to pay\r\n  the costs of repairs to the automobile.Â  The insured failed to have the repairs\r\n  made to the automobile and later defaulted on the loan by American Credit,\r\n  causing the automobile to be repossessed in a damaged condition in the amount of\r\n  $1,801.67.\r\nAmerican\r\n  Credit filed a claim with Nationwide in the amount of $1,307.67[1] and contended it was entitled to payment via the Loss Payable Clause in the\r\n  insurance policy.\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    pertinent portion of the Loss Payable Clause states that:\r\n  Protection\r\n    of the lienholderâ€™s financial interest will not be affected by any change in\r\n    ownership of the vehicle insured, nor by any act or omission by any person\r\n    entitled to coverage under this policy.Â  However, protection under this clause\r\n    does not apply in any case of conversion, embezzlement, secretion, or willful\r\n    damaging or destruction, of the vehicle committed by or at the direction of an\r\n    insured.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of\r\n  the evidence in the trial, the magistrate granted Nationwideâ€™s motion for a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  The magistrate found the insured received payment from\r\n  another insurance company for the damage to the automobile and, rather than\r\n  utilizing these funds to repair the automobile, as required under her financing\r\n  contract with American Credit, she converted these funds to her own use.Â  The\r\n  magistrate found that this amounted to a conversion of that portion of the\r\n  automobile which was damaged.Â  As a result of the conversion, the magistrate\r\n  found the protection of the lienholderâ€™s financial interest did not apply under\r\n  the clear language of the Loss Payable Clause.\r\nAmerican Credit\r\n  appealed to the circuit court.Â  The court ruled the magistrate properly granted\r\n  Nationwideâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  The court found the insured\r\n  essentially converted that portion of the automobile that was damaged and paid\r\n  for by Allstate.Â  As a result, any claim American Credit had under the Loss\r\n  Payable Clause was barred by the provision stating that protection under that\r\n  Clause does not apply in a case of conversion committed by or at the discretion\r\n  of the insured.Â  The court stated that when the insured retained the funds she\r\n  received from Allstate, she was essentially altering the condition of the\r\n  automobile and accepting payments to the exclusion of the owner or lienholder.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Is the failure of the insured to\r\n    utilize the liability insurance proceeds to repair the damaged automobile a\r\n    conversion of the automobile within the meaning of the Loss Payable Clause of\r\n    the policy?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA\r\n  loss payable clause is a type of clause used in insurance contracts by which a\r\n  lienholder or mortgagee protects its interests in the insured property.Â  There\r\n  are two types of loss payable clauses:Â  (1) a loss payable or open mortgage\r\n  clause, and (2) a standard clause.Â  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hunt,\r\n  327 S.C. 89, 488 S.E.2d 339 (1997).Â  A lienholderâ€™s ability to recover on an\r\n  insurance policy largely depends on the type of clause used in the insurance\r\n  contract.Â  Id.Â  In general, a loss payable or open mortgage clause\r\n  merely identifies the person or entity that may collect the insurance proceeds\r\n  and an insuredâ€™s misconduct bars recovery by the lienholder.Â  Id.Â  On\r\n  the other hand, under a standard clause, the interests of the lienholder in the\r\n  proceeds of the policy will not be invalidated by the misconduct of the\r\n  insured.Â  Id.\r\nBy asserting the\r\n  insuredâ€™s misconduct bars American Credit from recovering under the policy, the\r\n  dissent would find that the Clause at issue is the narrower loss payable or\r\n  open mortgage clause.Â  However, the type of clause involved here is a standard\r\n  clause that contains exceptions, such as the conversion exception, which can\r\n  preclude recovery by the lienholder.Â  Nationwideâ€™s Loss Payable Clause\r\n  specifically states that â€œprotection of the lienholderâ€™s financial interest\r\n  will not be affected by . . . any act or omission by any person entitled to\r\n  coverage under this policyâ€ except â€œin any case of conversionâ€ of the vehicle.Â \r\n  In other words, Nationwide will not be obligated to make payment to American\r\n  Credit as a result of the insured misappropriating the funds only if such act\r\n  constitutes a conversion of the vehicle by or at the direction of the insured.Â \r\n  Therefore, contrary to the dissentâ€™s view, a plain reading of the Clause\r\n  extends protection to American Creditâ€™s interest in the automobile\r\n  notwithstanding the insuredâ€™s misconduct, save for the specified exclusion.[2]\r\nThe insurance\r\n  policy does not define conversion so we must determine whether the failure of\r\n  the insured to utilize insurance proceeds received from a separate insurer to\r\n  repair the damaged automobile is a conversion of the automobile within the\r\n  meaning of Nationwideâ€™s Loss Payable Clause.\r\nInsurance policies\r\n  are subject to the general rules of contract construction.Â  Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc.,&nbsp;348 S.C. 559, 561 S.E.2d 355&nbsp;(2002).Â  We must\r\n  give policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.Â  Id.Â  An insurance policy is to be liberally construed in favor of the insured and\r\n  strictly construed against the insurer.      Kraft v. Hartford Ins. Companies, 279 S.C. 257, 305 S.E.2d 243 (1983).Â \r\n  Further, exclusions in an insurance\r\n  policy are always construed most strongly against the insurer.Â  Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders,\r\nInc., supra.\r\nWe have stated that\r\n  conversion is a wrongful act and have defined conversion as the unauthorized\r\n  assumption in the exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal\r\n  chattels belonging to another to the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.Â  SSI\r\n    Medical Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789&nbsp;(1990).Â \r\n  Conversion may arise by some illegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of\r\n  anotherâ€™s chattel.Â  Id.\r\nThe insuredâ€™s\r\n  failure to utilize the insurance proceeds received from the other driverâ€™s\r\n  insurer to repair the damaged automobile is not a conversion.Â  The insured\r\n  owned the automobile at the time she retained the funds that should have been\r\n  used to repair the damaged automobile.Â  The insured had not defaulted on the\r\n  installment contract and the car had not been repossessed; therefore, she was\r\n  still the owner.Â  What is envisioned by the exception to Nationwideâ€™s Loss\r\n  Payable Clause is the conversion of the insured property, that is, the\r\n  automobile.[3]Â \r\n  No such conversion has occurred here.Â  At all relevant times, the insured has\r\n  not directed or allowed the ownership of the automobile to be assumed by\r\n  another to the exclusion of the insuredâ€™s rights.Â  See SSI Med.\r\n    Servs., Inc. v. Cox, supra (conversion is unauthorized assumption in\r\n  exercise of right of ownership over goods belonging to another to the exclusion\r\n  of the ownerâ€™s rights).Â  See also Foremost Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins.\r\n    Co., 486 N.W.2d 600 (Mich. 1992) (person cannot convert his own property;\r\n  intentional burning of mobile home did not amount to conversion within meaning of\r\n  loss payable clause); Gibraltar Fin. Corp. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.,\r\n  513 N.E.2d 681 (Mass. 1987) (burning of an insured automobile by mortgagor did\r\n  not constitute conversion because, at the time of the arson, no one other than\r\n  the owner/mortgagor had an immediate right to possess the automobile;\r\n  therefore, the mortgageeâ€™s recovery under the policy was not precluded); Nationwide\r\n    Mut. Ins. Co. v. Dempsey, 495 S.E.2d 914 (N.C. App.), review denied,\r\n  502 S.E.2d 847 (N.C. 1998) (automobile policyâ€™s loss payable clause which\r\n  invalidated lienholderâ€™s interest only upon insuredâ€™s conversion of vehicle did\r\n  not apply when vehicle was destroyed by fire allegedly set by insured since\r\n  vehicle was not changed from one purpose to another).\r\nBecause the\r\n  exclusion in the insurance policy is to be construed strongly against the\r\n  insurer and Nationwide failed to define conversion to include the\r\n  aforementioned facts, the lower courts erred by finding a conversion had\r\n  occurred when the insured retained the insurance proceeds and failed to repair\r\n  the automobile.Â  See Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders,\r\n    Inc., supra (exclusions in an insurance policy are always construed\r\n  most strongly against the insurer).Â  See also Chrysler Credit Corp.\r\n    v. Dairyland Ins. Co., 491 So.2d 402 (La. Ct. App.), writ denied,\r\n  484 So.2d 1178 (La. 1986) (while not determining whether the actions\r\n  constituted conversion, court held where a policy fails to define the term\r\n  â€œlossâ€ it is unclear whether the application by the insured to his personal use\r\n  of the funds received in settlement from the tortfeasorâ€™s insurer is a â€œloss\r\n  caused by conversion,â€ thus relieving the insurer of its obligation to pay the\r\n  claim of the loss payee; the court found, because of the ambiguity, the policy\r\n  must be construed against the insurer).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â Â Â Â Â Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm.Â  In my\r\n  opinion, under the facts of this case, the loss-payable clause does not provide\r\n  American Credit with a right to recover from Nationwide the amount retained by\r\n  the defaulting insured after she received payment from a third-partyâ€™s\r\n  liability carrier.[4]\r\nIt has been held\r\n  that an insuredâ€™s misconduct bars recovery by the lienholder under a\r\n  loss-payable clause.Â  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hunt, 327 S.C. 89, 93,\r\n  488 S.C. 339, 341 (1997).Â  Furthermore, the loss-payable clause merely\r\n  identifies the person who may collect the proceeds, and the lienholder stands\r\n  in the insuredâ€™s shoes and is usually subject to the same defenses.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  Nationwideâ€™s policy with its insured in this case, the loss-payable clause\r\n  specifically states, â€œThis clause applies to the Comprehensive and Collision\r\n  coverages provided by this policy.â€Â  Because, under the facts of this case,\r\n  Nationwideâ€™s coverage was never triggered, the loss-payable clause is simply\r\n  not involved.Â  Again, the lienholder merely stands in the shoes of the\r\n  insured.Â  Hunt, supra.Â  If Nationwide is not obligated to tender\r\n  payment to its insured, the loss-payable clause does not inure to the benefit\r\n  of American Credit.Â Â Â  This loss-payable clause applies only in the event of a\r\n  valid first-party claim under the policy between the insured and Nationwide.Â \r\n  American Credit could only receive the benefit of the loss-payable clause\r\n  should Nationwide have tendered payment to its insured without protecting\r\n  American Creditâ€™s rights as a lienholder, or had otherwise participated in some\r\n  way to the derogation of American Creditâ€™s rights.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, because there was never a first-party claim, I am at a loss to\r\n  discern why Nationwide is now liable for its insuredâ€™s misapplication of\r\n  proceeds received from the at-fault partyâ€™s carrier.Â  Nationwideâ€™s obligation\r\n  does not extend to insuring American Credit against losses over which\r\n  Nationwide had no control.[5]Â \r\n  American Credit must look solely to the insured who failed to submit to\r\n  American Credit insurance proceeds from Allstate when she defaulted on the\r\n  loan.[6]\r\nIn\r\n  my opinion, the loss-payable clause found in the insurance contract between\r\n  Nationwide and its insured did not protect American Creditâ€™s interest where\r\n  that interest was damaged by the acts of a third-party or by the insured.Â  I\r\n  would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]$1,307.67\r\n  represents the cost of repair of the automobile less the $500 deductible as\r\nprovided in the insurance policy. \r\n[2]Although\r\n  the dissent would find the Loss Payable Clause at issue is the narrower loss\r\n  payable, or open mortgage, clause, the issue the parties asked this Court to\r\n  resolve was not whether American Credit could recover pursuant to the Loss\r\n  Payable Clause, but rather whether the exclusions contained in the Loss Payable\r\n  Clause barred American Creditâ€™s claim.Â  Nationwide has never argued that the\r\n  Clause was the narrower loss payable or open mortgage clause, nor did\r\n  Nationwide assert that any misconduct on behalf of the insured barred\r\n  American Creditâ€™s claim.Â  In fact, in its brief to this Court, Nationwide\r\n  admits that â€œthe policy does provide additional protection to the . . .\r\n  lienholder by indicating that the lienholderâ€™s right will not be affected by\r\n  the acts of the insured.â€Â  This statement clearly indicates that Nationwide\r\n  acknowledged that the Clause provided broader protection to a lienholder.Â  In\r\n  any event, because Nationwide did not argue that this Clause was the narrower\r\n  loss payable or open mortgage clause, this issue is not preserved.Â  See Holy\r\n    Loch Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 531 S.E.2d 282 (2000) (to\r\n  preserve issue for appellate review, issue must have been raised to and ruled\r\nupon by the trial court).\r\n[3]The\r\n  exception states:Â  â€œprotection under this clause does not apply in any case of\r\n  conversion . . . of the vehicle committed by or at the direction of the\r\ninsured.â€Â  (Emphasis added). \r\n[4] While I do not believe the interpretation of the\r\n  loss-payable clause controls this case, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s\r\n  statement that the clause be strictly construed against Nationwide in favor of\r\n  American Credit.Â  Nationwideâ€™s failure to define the term â€œconversionâ€ in the\r\n  insuredâ€™s policy does not necessarily require us to apply that term narrowly to\r\n  these facts.Â  The loss-payable clause in this case is not an exclusion of\r\n  coverage for the insured but exists for the benefit of a lienholder who is not\r\n  a party to the insurance contract.\r\n[5] Indeed, there is no indication that Nationwide was ever made aware of the event\r\nwhich occasioned damage to the vehicle.\r\n[6] Insured was under no obligation to American Credit to repair her vehicle with\r\n  the money paid by Allstate so long as she made payments on the loan from\r\nAmerican Credit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26510","title":"State v.

Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 528 S.E.2d 661 (2000).Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1)\r\n     Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n    finding the primary purpose of the checkpoint was for general crime control and\r\n    therefore it was violative of the Fourth Amendment under City of\r\n    Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32 (2000)?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2)\r\n    Whether the circuit court erred in\r\n    holding that even if the primary purpose was a license checkpoint and there was\r\n    no Edmond flaw, the roadblock none-the-less violated the Fourth\r\n    Amendment under Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979)?\r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  controlling decision in this matter is City of Indianapolis v. Edmond,\r\n  531 U.S. 32 (2000).Â  In Edmond, the Court held that a police checkpoint\r\n  whose primary purpose is general crime control- in Edmond narcotics\r\n  interdiction- is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\r\nHere, the circuit\r\n  court judge acknowledged there was conflicting evidence on the true purpose of\r\n  the checkpoint, but was persuaded the primary purpose was general crime\r\n  suppression rather then merely a driversâ€™ license checkpoint.Â  He pointed to\r\n  the following facts to support his conclusion:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1)&nbsp;\r\n     the checkpoint was conducted by\r\n  the Directed Patrol Unit, which is assigned specifically to deal with crime\r\n  suppression issues;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2)&nbsp;\r\n    a K-9 patrol unit with a\r\n  nationally certified drug dog team was participating; and,\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3)\r\n    the State presented no evidence as\r\n  to the plan, procedures, or duration of the roadblock, nor was any evidence of\r\n  a protocol introduced and as the Supreme Court noted in Edmond, without\r\n  such information &ldquo;law enforcement authorities would be able to establish\r\n  checkpoints for virtually any purpose so long as they include a license or\r\n  sobriety check.&rdquo;&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court went on to find that even if the primary purpose were a license\r\n  checkpoint and thus the roadblock passed constitutional muster under Edmond,\r\n  the roadblock would still violate the Fourth Amendment under Brown v. Texas,\r\n  443 U.S. 47 (1979).Â  Brown established a three part balancing test for\r\ndetermining the constitutionality of a traffic checkpoint:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1)\r\n    the gravity of the public interest\r\n  served by the seizure;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2)&nbsp;\r\n    the degree to which the seizure\r\n  serves the public interest; and,\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3)&nbsp;\r\n    the severity of the interference\r\n  with individual liberty.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge held the\r\n  first and third factors easily weighed in the Stateâ€™s favor, but found that the\r\nState presented no evidence on the second factor.\r\nThe\r\n  State first argues the trial judge erred in finding the primary purpose here\r\n  was suppression of drug activity.Â  It does not argue that there is no evidence\r\n  to support the ruling, but instead contends the judge placed â€œundue emphasisâ€\r\n  on certain facts.Â  Under this Courtâ€™s limited scope of review, the finding that\r\n  the primary purpose of the roadblock was general crime suppression is supported\r\n  by the evidence, and the conclusion that it violated the Fourth Amendment under Edmond must be affirmed.Â  State v. Brockman, supra.\r\nThe State next\r\n  argues the trial judge abused his discretion finding the State failed to meet\r\n  the second Brown factor, the â€œeffectivenessâ€ requirement.Â  The State\r\n  argues that it need not introduce evidence about the specific effectiveness of\r\n  this roadblock because, by its very nature, every license check roadblock\r\n  determines whether the driver is legally licensed. Â The Stateâ€™s position that\r\n  license check roadblocks are ipso facto constitutional, thereby\r\n  eliminating the requirement of effectiveness from the Brown formula relies\r\n  upon Michigan Depâ€™t of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990).Â  While Sitz does criticize â€œsearching examination of effectivenessâ€ by trial\r\n  courts, it retains the requirement that the State produce empirical data to\r\n  support the effectiveness of its roadblock. Sitz at 454 (â€œunlike [Delaware\r\n    v. Proust, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), this case [does not involve] a complete\r\n  absence of empirical data . . . .â€). Â The record supports the trial courtâ€™s finding\r\n  that the State failed to produce any evidence satisfying the second prong of\r\n  the Brown test.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere is evidence\r\n  in the record supporting the trial judgeâ€™s finding that the primary purpose of\r\n  this roadblock was general crime suppression and therefore his conclusion that\r\n  the roadblock violated Edmond must be affirmed.Â  State v. Brockman, supra.Â  Even if we were to disagree with this finding, the record\r\n  supports the trial judgeâ€™s secondary holding that the Stateâ€™s failure to\r\n  produce any evidence on the second prong of the Brown v. Texas test\r\n  renders the checkpoint unconstitutional.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the order\r\n  suppressing the evidence is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER\r\nand BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would reverse the trial courtâ€™s order\r\n  suppressing the evidence and hold that this checkpoint did not violate the\r\n  Fourth Amendment.\r\nIn City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32 (2000), the United States\r\n  Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits law enforcement from\r\n  setting up a traffic checkpoint where the â€œprogrammaticâ€ primary purpose is\r\n  general crime control.Â  The relevant jurisprudence instructs that the test to\r\n  determine the primary purpose of a checkpoint is an objective test, and that\r\n  the examining court should â€œconsider all the\r\n  available evidence in order to determine the relevant primary purpose.â€Â  Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532\r\n  U.S. 67, 81 (2001) (citing Edmond, 531 U.S. at 45-47).Â  \r\nIn my view, there is no evidence in the record to\r\n  support the trial courtâ€™s finding that the primary purpose of this checkpoint\r\n  was general crime control.Â  The record shows that in accordance with the\r\n  sheriffâ€™s departmentâ€™s guidelines, law enforcement officers placed signs on\r\n  each road approaching the checkpoint alerting drivers to the checkpoint.Â  Law\r\n  enforcement officers stopped every vehicle, detained the drivers for no more\r\n  than two minutes, and only after ascertaining probable cause would they ask the\r\n  driver to pull off the road into a parking lot for further questioning.Â \r\n  Additionally, an officer testified that the purpose of the checkpoint was to\r\n  verify that every driver had a valid license and registration.Â  Considering all\r\n  the evidence in the record, I do not believe that the primary purpose of this\r\n  checkpoint was general crime prevention, nor do I believe that this checkpoint\r\n  allowed officers to exercise standardless and unconstrained discretion.Â  See Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 663 (1979) (invalidating discretionary\r\n  â€œspot checkingâ€ in which the officer stopped random motorists on public\r\n  highways solely for the purpose of checking the driversâ€™ license and\r\n  registration).Â  \r\nFurther, in my opinion, the\r\n  majority errs in suggesting that Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979)\r\n  requires the State to provide empirical data regarding the effectiveness of\r\n  checkpoints or that Mich. Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496\r\n  U.S. 444 (1990) retained this requirement.Â  In\r\n  ruling on the constitutionality of a suspicionless checkpoint in which police\r\n  stopped every vehicle, the Sitz court noted that the case did not\r\n  involve â€œa complete absence of empirical data.â€Â  Id. at 454Â  However,\r\n  the Supreme Court went on to hold that the second prong of the Brown test\r\n  â€œwas not meant to transfer from politically accountable officials\r\n  to the courts the decision as to which among reasonable alternative law\r\n  enforcement techniques should be employed to deal with a serious public dangerâ€\r\n  and that â€œfor purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis . . . [this decision] remains with the\r\n  governmental officials.â€Â  Sitz, 496 U.S. at 454. \r\nIn my view, the balance of the public\r\n  interest and the severity of the interference with individual liberty clearly\r\n  weighs in favor of this checkpoint.Â  As noted by the trial court, the intrusion\r\n  on individual liberty was minimal and the State has a high interest in\r\n  preventing unlicensed or uninsured drivers from operating vehicles.Â  In my\r\n  opinion, this checkpoint provides an effective method of curtailing this\r\n  problem in that every vehicle was stopped and every driver was required to\r\n  produce their license, registration, and proof of insurance.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  fact remains that decisions regarding the techniques and methods of combating\r\n  roadway dangers remains with law enforcement.Â  See Id. Â Perhaps most significant, however, is that this\r\n  checkpoint modeled the types of checkpoints that have been upheld as\r\n  constitutional under the Fourth Amendment.Â  See Sitz, 496 U.S. at 455 (holding that a\r\n  suspicionless seizure where law enforcement briefly stopped all motorists crossing\r\n  the checkpoint did not violate the Fourth Amendment); Prouse, 440\r\n  U.S. at 663 (distinguishing between the unconstitutional seizure of drivers\r\n  without reasonable suspicion and the â€œ[q]uestioning of all\r\n  oncoming traffic at roadblock-type stopsâ€); United States\r\n    v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 566 (1976) (holding\r\n  that â€œstops for brief questioning routinely conducted at\r\n  permanent checkpoints are consistent with the Fourth Amendmentâ€).Â  Indeed,\r\n  while Edmond held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits a suspicionless\r\n  stop whose â€œprogrammaticâ€ primary purpose is general crime control, the\r\n  â€œholding [] [did] nothing to\r\n  alter the constitutional status of the sobriety and border checkpoints that\r\n[the United States Supreme Court] approved in Sitz and Martinez-Fuerte, or of the type of traffic checkpoint that we suggested would be lawful in Prouse.â€Â  Edmond at 47.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I would hold that the\r\n  primary purpose of this checkpoint was not general crime prevention and that\r\n  the checkpoint did not violate Appellantâ€™s Fourth Amendment rights.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26512","title":"Auto Owners Insurance Company v.

Wright d/b/a Wrightâ€™s Auto Sales.Â  Rollison, Reedâ€™s fifteen-year-old\r\n  friend and passenger in the vehicle, was injured in the accident.Â  The vehicle\r\n  involved in the accident was insured by Auto Owners under a Commercial General\r\n  Liability Policy that included a Garage Liability Coverage Form and a Dealersâ€™\r\n  Blanket Coverage Form. \r\nRollison brought\r\n  suit against Reed, Wright, and Wrightâ€™s Auto Sales to recover for injuries\r\n  sustained in the accident.Â  Auto Owners filed a declaratory judgment action seeking\r\n  a determination that neither policy provided coverage.Â  In its Complaint, Auto\r\n  Owners alleged that Wrightâ€™s policies did not provide coverage because, at the\r\n  time of the accident, Reed:Â  (1) was not a permissive user of the vehicle or a\r\n  resident of Wrightâ€™s home; and (2) was not using the vehicle for purposes\r\n  associated with Wrightâ€™s Auto Sales.Â  Additionally, Auto Owners contended the\r\n  policies did not provide underinsured or uninsured motorist coverage to Rollison\r\n  because he was not a permissive user or guest in the vehicle at the time of the\r\n  accident.Â  In response, Rollison filed a counterclaim seeking liability\r\n  coverage, or in the alternative, uninsured motorist coverage under the Garage\r\n  Liability policy.Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  judge conducted a nonjury trial.Â  The trial and deposition testimony\r\n  established that at the time of the accident Reed did not have permission to\r\n  drive Wrightâ€™s vehicle nor was he a resident relative of Wright.Â  Wright\r\n  testified that at the time of the accident Reed lived alone in a camper located\r\n  on the premises of the auto sales business.Â  Although Reed had unlimited access\r\n  to the business office where the vehicle keys were stored, Wright claimed he\r\n  did not give Reed permission to drive any of the vehicles off the sales lot.Â \r\n  In terms of the vehicle involved in the accident, Wright testified he intended\r\n  to give Reed the vehicle for his birthday when he received an unrestricted\r\n  driverâ€™s license. Â Wright, however, never gave Reed permission to drive the\r\n  vehicle on a public road.Â  In fact, Wright stated he told the police officers\r\n  at the scene of the accident that the vehicle had been taken without his\r\n  permission. Â Wright further testified he was unaware that Reed had previously\r\n  driven vehicles off the lot before the time of the accident.Â  Had he known,\r\n  Wright stated he would have â€œtried [his] best to stopâ€ it.\r\nReed confirmed his\r\n  grandfatherâ€™s testimony.Â  Reed testified his grandfather did not know before\r\n  the date of the accident that he had driven vehicles off the sales lot.Â \r\n  According to Reed, he had driven two of the vehicles off the sales lot on at\r\n  least ten occasions.Â  However, he always drove the vehicles at night so that\r\n  his grandfather did not witness what he was doing.Â  Reed acknowledged that his\r\n  grandfather never gave him permission to drive the vehicle that was involved in\r\n  the accident. \r\nIn contrast,\r\n  Rollison testified he witnessed Reed drive five to ten different vehicles on at\r\n  least thirty occasions.Â  He further testified that Reedâ€™s grandfather was often\r\n  present when Reed drove off and returned to the sales lot. Â Rollison assumed\r\n  Reed had permission to drive the vehicle that was involved in the accident\r\n  because Reed told him that his grandfather had given him the vehicle.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Rollison testified that Reed had the keys to the vehicle and had never been\r\n  reprimanded by his grandfather for driving off the sales lot.\r\nTwo teenage friends\r\n  of Rollison corroborated his testimony.Â  Michael J. Kinney testified that on at\r\n  least five occasions he had been a passenger in a vehicle that Reed drove off\r\n  the sales lot in the presence of his grandfather.Â  Kinney believed Reed had\r\n  permission to drive the vehicles because he had the keys and had never been\r\n  reprimanded by his grandfather for driving.Â  However, he admitted there were\r\n  times when Reed avoided returning the vehicle at night when his grandfather was\r\n  still present at the sales lot.Â  Kinney testified that Reed would â€œcircle\r\n  aroundâ€ until his grandfather left the dealership for the evening.Â  Because of\r\n  this behavior, Kinney conceded he was under the impression that Reed did not\r\n  have permission to drive the vehicle at night. \r\nH. Patrick Hodge,\r\n  III, gave a similar account to that of Kinney.Â  Â Hodge testified that Reed\r\n  â€œalways had keys to the [Plymouth] Laserâ€ and that the vehicle was a gift from\r\n  Reedâ€™s grandfather.Â  Hodge claimed he had seen Reed drive â€œnumerousâ€ vehicles.Â \r\n  On several occasions, Hodge witnessed Reed drive these vehicles off the sales\r\n  lot in the presence of his grandfather.Â  Like Kinney, Hodge also observed that\r\n  when returning a vehicle at night Reed often would circle the auto sales lot\r\n  and enter it only after his grandfather was no longer at the business.Â  Kinney\r\n  interpreted Reedâ€™s behavior to mean that he had permission to drive but just\r\n  not at night.\r\nBased on this\r\n  evidence and the terms of the insurance policies, the circuit court ruled the\r\n  Commercial General Liability Policy did not provide coverage for the accident\r\n  as a matter of law because the policy contained an exclusion for bodily injury\r\n  arising out of the use of the automobile.Â  Additionally, the court found the\r\n  Garage Liability policy did not provide coverage because Reed did not have\r\n  Wrightâ€™s express or implied permission to drive the vehicle on the night of the\r\n  accident.Â  Therefore, the court held Reed did not qualify as an â€œinsuredâ€\r\n  pursuant to section 38-77-30(7)[1] of the South Carolina Code or the terms of the policy.Â Â Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  Reed was not a permissive user of Wrightâ€™s vehicle at the time of the accident,\r\n  the court found the vehicle would be deemed uninsured pursuant to this Courtâ€™s\r\n  holding in Unisun Insurance Company v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  280 (2000).Â  The court, however, concluded that Rollison was not entitled to\r\n  uninsured motorist benefits under the Garage Liability policy because he was\r\n  not a permissive guest in the vehicle at the time of the accident.Â  In reaching\r\n  this decision, the court reasoned that Rollison could not be a â€œguestâ€ within\r\n  the meaning of section 38-77-30(7) of the South Carolina Code without the named\r\n  insuredâ€™s permission.\r\nRollison\r\n  only appeals the portion of the circuit courtâ€™s order regarding his status as a\r\n  â€œguestâ€ for purposes of uninsured motorist coverage.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRollison argues the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  that he was precluded from receiving uninsured motorist coverage from the\r\n  Garage Liability policy issued by Auto Owners to Wrightâ€™s Auto Sales.Â  He\r\n  contends he was a â€œguestâ€ in the vehicle to which the policy applied.Â \r\n  Specifically, he asserts that a passenger is not required to use the vehicle or\r\n  have the named insuredâ€™s permission in order to qualify as a â€œguestâ€ under the\r\n  terms of section 38-77-30(7).Â  For reasons that will be more fully discussed,\r\n  we agree that Rollison was a guest at the time of the accident.\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable,\r\n  but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  An insurance policy is\r\n  a contract contract law. Â Estate of Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C.\r\n  470, 477, 484 S.E.2d 112, 116 (Ct.

Somers, 319 S.C. 65,\r\n  67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).Â  Thus, because this action involves the\r\n  interpretation of a contract and statutes, it is an action at law.Â  Barnacle\r\n    Broad., Inc. v.

City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nAs recognized by the circuit court judge in his order, this Courtâ€™s\r\n  case of Unisun provides guidance for a determination of whether a\r\n  passenger in a vehicle may recover uninsured motorist benefits under the\r\n  vehicle ownerâ€™s policy. Â Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 280 (2000).Â  In Unisun, January Oâ€™Neale was given a BMW by her\r\n  father with instructions not to let anyone else drive the vehicle.Â  One night,\r\n  Oâ€™Neale and her friend Jennifer Hurst drove to a party at Christopher Schmidtâ€™s\r\n  house.Â  During the course of the party, Schmidt drove off in the BMW with Hurst as a passenger.Â  Schmidt was involved in a single-vehicle accident which resulted in\r\n  Hurst being injured.Â  As stipulated by the parties, Schmidtâ€™s use of the\r\n  vehicle was not consensual, but Hurstâ€™s use was at all times consensual.Â  Id. at 364-65, 529 S.E.2d at 281.Â  State Farm, the insurance carrier for the BMW,\r\n  successfully denied liability coverage as a result of Schmidtâ€™s non-permissive\r\n  use of the vehicle.Â  Hurst sought uninsured motorist coverage, claiming the\r\n  denial of liability coverage by State Farm rendered the BMW an uninsured motor\r\n  vehicle.Â  Because she was a permissive occupant, guest, or user of the BMW at\r\n  the time of the accident, Hurst asserted she was covered under State Farmâ€™s\r\n  uninsured motorist policy and the uninsured motor vehicle insurance statutes.Â  Id. at 365, 529 S.E.2d at 281.Â  The circuit court agreed with Hurst, holding that\r\n  she could make an uninsured motorist claim against the State Farm policy which\r\n  insured the BMW.Â  Id.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that â€œHurst was not an insured, because â€˜[w]hen Schmidt drove off in the BMW without permission,\r\n  the BMW was no longer a motor vehicle to which the policy applied.â€™â€Â  Id. at 365, 529 S.E.2d at 281 (quoting Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 331 S.C.\r\n  437, 442, 503 S.E.2d 211, 214 (Ct. App. 1998)).Â  \r\nHurst petitioned for and was granted certiorari by this Court.Â  We reversed the Court\r\n  of Appealsâ€™ decision.Â  In doing so, we analyzed the following questions:Â  (1)\r\n  was Hurst an â€œinsuredâ€ within the meaning of section 38-77-30(7) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code; and (2) was the BMW an uninsured motor vehicle?Â  \r\nThis Court answered the first question in the affirmative based on\r\n  several grounds.Â  As our primary basis, we noted that â€œRespondentâ€™s concession\r\n  that Hurst was a â€˜guest and/or permissive occupant and/or permissive userâ€™ of\r\n  the vehicle places Hurst squarely within the statutory definition of\r\n  â€˜insured.â€™â€Â  Unisun, 339 S.C. at 366, 529 S.E.2d at 282.Â  However, even\r\n  without the Respondentâ€™s concession, this Court found that Hurst fell within\r\n  the definition of â€œinsuredâ€ under the uninsured motorist statute and the insurance\r\n  policy given the BMW was a vehicle â€œto which the policy applied,â€ and Hurstâ€™s\r\n  â€œuseâ€ of the vehicle was at all times consensual.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn terms of the second question, we found the BMW was â€œan\r\n  uninsured motor vehicle based on the plain language of the statute and public\r\n  policy.â€Â  Id. at 367, 529 S.E.2d at 282.Â  Because State Farm\r\n  successfully denied liability coverage, the Court concluded that the BMW fell\r\n  within section 38-77-30(14) of the South Carolina Code, the uninsured motorist\r\n  law.[2]Â  Additionally, we found this decision\r\n  was consistent with the purpose of the uninsured motorist law, which is â€œâ€˜to\r\n  provide benefits and protection against the peril of injury or death by an\r\n  uninsured motorist to an insured motorist, his family, and the permissive users\r\n  of his vehicle.â€™â€ Â Id. at 368, 529 S.E.2d at 283 (quoting Ferguson v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 96, 100, 198, S.E.2d 522,\r\n  524 (1973)).\r\nWe believe our analysis in Unisun is instructive in the\r\n  instant case in that it establishes: Â (1) what constitutes an uninsured motor\r\n  vehicle when an insurer successfully denies liability coverage; and (2) that a\r\n  passenger who rides with the consent of the named insured is a â€œguest.â€Â \r\n  However, Unisun is not dispositive given the significant factual\r\n  difference between the two cases.Â  In Unisun, the insurance carrier\r\n  conceded that Hurst was a guest or permissive user of the vehicle.Â  Here, Auto\r\n  Owners specifically asserts that Rollison was neither a permissive user nor\r\n  guest in the vehicle at the time of the accident. \r\nThe\r\n  factual scenario presented in this appeal requires this Court to extend the\r\n  holding in Unisun and answer the question of whether Rollison qualified\r\n  as a â€œguestâ€ under section 38-77-30(7).Â  In analyzing this issue, we are guided\r\n  by the general rules of statutory construction.\r\nThe\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the Legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient\r\n  to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably\r\n  discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in light\r\n  of the intended purpose of the statute.â€ Â Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Commâ€™n, 342 S.C. 373, 380, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  The court\r\n  should give words their plain and ordinary meaning, without resort to subtle or\r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation. Sloan v.\r\n    S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452, 469, 636 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  607 (2006). Â â€œWe will reject a statutory\r\n  interpretation when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that\r\n  it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain\r\n  legislative intention.â€Â  Unisun, 339 S.C. at 368, 529 S.E.2d at 283.\r\nThe specific statute at issue, the uninsured motorist statute, is\r\n  remedial in nature.Â  Unisun, 339 S.C. at 366, 529 S.E.2d at 282.Â  â€œA\r\n  statute remedial in nature should be liberally construed in order to accomplish\r\n  the object sought.â€Â  Inabinet v. Royal Exchange Assur. of London, 165\r\n  S.C. 33, 36, 162 S.E. 599, 600 (1932).Â  \r\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the language of section\r\n  38-77-30(7).Â  Under this section, an â€œinsuredâ€ is defined as:Â  (1) the named\r\n  insured while in the motor vehicle or otherwise; (2) the named insuredâ€™s\r\n  resident relatives, specifically his or her spouse, while in the motor vehicle or\r\n  otherwise; (3) any person who uses with the consent, expressed or implied, of\r\n  the named insured the motor vehicle to which the policy applies; and (4) a\r\n    guest in the motor vehicle to which the policy applies or the personal\r\n  representative of any of the above-listed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7) (2002); see Davidson v. E. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 245 S.C. 472, 477,\r\n  141 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1965) (interpreting section 46-750.11(2) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, the precursor to section 38-77-30(7), and defining the following\r\n  two classes of insureds:Â  (1) the named insured, his spouse and his or her\r\n  relatives resident in the same household, while in the vehicle or otherwise;\r\n  and (2) any person using, with the consent of the named insured, the motor\r\n  vehicle to which the policy applies and a guest in such motor vehicle to\r\n  which the policy applies). \r\nA review of the plain language of the statute reveals that â€œguestâ€\r\n  is listed independently as a person who constitutes an â€œinsured.â€Â  As we\r\n  interpret the statute, a person in the fourth category of â€œinsuredâ€ need only\r\n  have the status of a â€œguestâ€ to qualify as an â€œinsured.â€ Â In comparison, for a\r\n  person to constitute an â€œinsuredâ€ under the third category, he or she must use\r\n  the vehicle and have the express or implied consent of the named insured.Â  See Davidson, 245 S.C. at 477-78, 141 S.E.2d at 138 (stating â€œ[t]he members\r\n  of the second [class] . . . the permissive user and the guest, are\r\n  covered while using, or a guest in, the motor vehicle to which the policy\r\n  applies, i.e., the motor vehicle designated in the policyâ€) (emphasis added).Â  Because\r\n  the Legislature did not include the consent language when it listed â€œguestâ€ in\r\n  the statute, we do not believe it intended to require a â€œguestâ€ to obtain the consent\r\n  of the named insured in order to be eligible for uninsured motorist coverage.Â  \r\nNotably, courts from other jurisdictions interpreting similar\r\n  statutory language have reached the same conclusion. Â See, e.g., Beard\r\n    v. Nunes, 603 S.E.2d 735, 737 (Ga. Ct. App. 2004) (applying Ga. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  33-7-11(b)(1)(B) and stating â€œ[t]he second category [of â€˜insuredsâ€™] consists of\r\n  â€˜any person who uses, with the expressed or implied consent of the named\r\n  insured, the motor vehicle to which the policy applies; a guest in such motor\r\n  vehicle to which the policy appliesâ€™â€); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Silverman, 423 S.E.2d 68, 71 (N.C. 1992) (applying N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§\r\n  20-279.21(b)(3) and stating â€œ[t]he second class of insured persons is referred\r\n  to as â€˜Class IIâ€™ insureds and includes any person who uses with the consent,\r\n  express or implied, of the named insured, the insured vehicle, and a guest in\r\n  such vehicle;â€ finding injured party was a â€œClass IIâ€ insured given she was\r\n  â€œmerely a guest in one of the covered vehiclesâ€).\r\nAdditionally, we believe our interpretation not only effectuates\r\n  the intention of the Legislature but is also consistent with the general\r\n  definition of a guest:\r\n\r\n  Generally speaking, a guest is one who\r\n    takes a ride in a car driven by another person, merely for his or her own\r\n    pleasure or on his or her own business, and without making any return or\r\n    conferring any benefit on the operator thereof. Â A guest is a person who is\r\n    carried in an automobile gratuitously, that is, one who gives no compensation\r\n    for the carriage.\r\n\r\n60A C.J.S. Motor\r\n  Vehicles Â§ 805 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2008); see Owens v. Gresham,\r\n  258 S.C. 46, 50, 186 S.E.2d 816, 818 (1972) (â€œâ€˜A person riding in a motor\r\n  vehicle is a guest if his transportation confers a benefit only upon himself\r\n  and no benefit upon the owner or operator except such as is incident to\r\n  hospitality, social relations, companionship, or the like as a mere gratuity.â€™â€\r\n  (quoting 8 Am. Jur. 2d Automobiles and Highway Traffic, Â§ 475)).Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, one who is a â€œguestâ€ at the invitation of\r\n  the driver has, by implication, the consent of the named insured.Â \r\n  Presumptively then, a guest has the consent of the named insured unless he or\r\n  she has knowledge to the contrary.Â  Logically, because the named insured would\r\n  rarely be present in a situation as in the facts of this case, a passenger can\r\n  only rely on the driverâ€™s representations regarding his status as a permissive\r\n  user.Â  Thus, a determination of whether a passenger qualifies as a â€œguestâ€\r\n  under the statute must be viewed from the passengerâ€™s perspective.[3]Â Â  \r\nWe believe that to define â€œguestâ€ otherwise would lead to an\r\n  absurd result which would require a passenger to specifically inquire whether\r\n  the driver either owned the vehicle or had permission from the named insured to\r\n  drive the vehicle.Â  Clearly, such an interpretation would be contrary to the\r\n  intention of the Legislature as well as the remedial purpose and inclusive\r\n  nature of the uninsured motorist statute.Â  See Ferguson v.\r\n    State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 96, 100, 198 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1973)\r\n  (â€œThe public policy declared by our uninsured motorist statute imposes an\r\n  obligation on insurers to provide protection to their insureds against loss\r\n  caused by wrongful conduct of an uninsured motorist.â€).Â  However, we emphasize that whether one is a mere passenger\r\n  or a â€œguestâ€ for purposes of determining an â€œinsuredâ€ is largely dependent upon\r\n  the facts and circumstances of each case, particularly the relationships among\r\n  the involved parties.Â  See Owens, 258 S.C. at 51, 186 S.E.2d at\r\n  818 (â€œWhether one is a passenger or a guest depends largely upon the facts and\r\ncircumstances of each particular case.â€).Â Â  \r\nTurning to the facts of the instant case, we hold the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding that Rollison was not entitled to uninsured motorist\r\n  coverage.Â  Applying Unisun, it is clear the vehicle involved in the\r\n  accident was an uninsured vehicle given Auto Owners successfully denied\r\n  liability coverage.Â  The question then becomes whether Rollison was an\r\n  â€œinsuredâ€ at the time of the accident pursuant to section 38-77-30(7).Â  As\r\n  previously discussed, the only possible category that Rollison could come\r\n  within is category four, a â€œguest.â€Â  Based on the specific facts of this case,\r\n  we conclude that Rollison was a â€œguest.â€[4]Â  \r\nOn the day of the accident, Reed drove to Rollisonâ€™s home during\r\n  daylight hours and invited him to drive to another friendâ€™s home. Â Based on Reedâ€™s\r\n  invitation, Rollison by implication had the consent of Wright, the named\r\n  insured.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence that Rollison had reason to know\r\n  that Reed was not a permissive user of Wrightâ€™s vehicle.Â  On multiple occasions\r\n  Rollison witnessed Reed drive off Wrightâ€™s sales lot.Â  Rollison also believed\r\n  that Reed had permission to drive the vehicle because he had possession of the\r\n  keys to the vehicle, a supposed gift from Wright, and had never been\r\n  reprimanded by Wright for driving off the sales lot.Â  Because Rollison was a\r\n  â€œguestâ€ and, thus, an â€œinsuredâ€ for the purposes of uninsured motorist\r\n  coverage, we reverse the decision of the circuit court.[5] \r\nREVERSED.[6] \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE AND WALLER, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order finding Rollison was not a guest within the coverage of the Auto\r\n  Ownersâ€™ policy.\r\n I agree with the\r\n  majority that our decision in this case rests on our interpretation of\r\n  â€œinsuredâ€ found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30 (7)(2002)[7]:\r\n\r\n  â€œInsuredâ€\r\n    means the named insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse\r\n    of any named insured and relatives of either, while in a motor vehicle or\r\n    otherwise, and any person who uses with the consent, expressed or implied, of\r\n    the named insured the motor vehicle to which the policy applies and a guest in\r\n    the motor vehicle to which the policy applies or the personal representative of\r\n    any of the above.\r\n\r\nAs I read the statute,\r\n  â€œinsuredâ€ means the named insured and resident relatives, persons using the car\r\n  with the consent of the named insured, and their guests.Â  While I agree that a\r\n  guest need not obtain the consent of the named insured to be covered by the\r\n  policy, in my view, whether a passenger is a â€œguest insuredâ€ is dependent on\r\n  the status of the person â€œinvitingâ€ him.Â  The statute unequivocally provides\r\n  that all passengers of the named insured and her resident relatives are â€œguest\r\n  insureds,â€ as are passengers invited by permissive users.Â  On the other hand,\r\n  passengers who were not â€œinvitedâ€ by one of these persons-the named insured,\r\n  her resident relatives, permissive users- are not guests and are therefore not\r\n  insureds.Â  This analysis is consistent with our decision in Unisun Ins. Co.\r\n    v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 529 S.E.2d 280 (2000).Â  In Unisun, it was\r\n  the status of the injured passenger as an â€œinviteeâ€ of both the named insured\r\n  and the permissive user which made her a â€œguestâ€ and thus an insured.Â  Since\r\n  Rollison was invited by a driver who did not have permission, I agree with the\r\n  trial court that he is not a â€˜guest insuredâ€ under the statute and therefore\r\n  not entitled to recover under the policy.\r\nI do not agree that\r\n  the status of a passenger should be determined from his perspective, and\r\n  furthermore do not agree with the majorityâ€™s holding that there is a\r\n  presumption that a passenger invited by the driver has been invited with the\r\n  named insuredâ€™s consent.[8]Â \r\n  If the Court determines to create this test and this presumption, then in my\r\n  opinion the case must be remanded for a hearing on this specific factual\r\n  inquiry.\r\nI would affirm the\r\n  circuit court order.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Section 38-77-30(7) provides:\r\n\r\n  â€œInsuredâ€\r\n    means the named insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse\r\n    of any named insured and relatives of either, while in a motor vehicle or\r\n    otherwise, and any person who uses with the consent, expressed or implied, of\r\n    the named insured the motor vehicle to which the policy applies and a guest in\r\n    the motor vehicle to which the policy applies or the personal representative of\r\n    any of the above.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7) (2002).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  Section 38-77-30(14) defines â€œuninsured motor\r\nvehicleâ€ to mean a vehicle as to which:\r\n\r\n  (a) there is not bodily injury liability\r\n    insurance and property damage liability insurance both at least in the amounts\r\n    specified in Section 38-77-140, or\r\n  (b) there is nominally that insurance, but\r\n    the insurer writing the same successfully denies coverage thereunder\r\n    . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(14)\r\n  (2002).\r\n[3]Â Â  Illustrative of this point is our comment in Unisun that Hurst, even without the concession of the parties that she was a â€œguest,â€\r\n  would have fallen â€œwithin the definition of â€˜insuredâ€™ under both the statute\r\n  and the policy.â€Â  Unisun, 339 S.C. at 366, 529 S.E.2d at 282.Â  Thus, an\r\n  invited passenger of a non-permissive driver may, but not necessarily, qualify\r\nas a â€œguestâ€ for the purposes of uninsured motorist coverage.\r\n[4] Recently,\r\n  our United States District Court reached a different conclusion when it considered Unisun and analyzed a question similar to the instant case.Â  Progressive\r\n    Specialty Ins. Co. v. Murray, 472 F.Supp.2d 732 (D.S.C. 2007). Â The holding\r\n  in that case is neither controlling nor dispositive.Â  The District Court\r\n  specifically noted that the question of whether someone qualifies as a â€œâ€˜guestâ€™\r\n  under the statute is a difficult question because the South Carolina courts\r\nhave never expressly defined that term.â€Â  Id. at 738.Â  \r\n[5] Â Auto Owners asserts that to allow Rollison to\r\n  recover uninsured motorist benefits is contrary to the language of the policy\r\n  at issue. We find this issue to be without merit given the statute is\r\n  controlling if the terms of the policy excluding coverage are in conflict with\r\n  the requirements of the statute.Â  See Hogan v. Home Ins. Co., 260\r\n  S.C. 157, 160, 194 S.E.2d 890, 891 (1973) (â€œIf the provision excluding coverage is in conflict with the\r\n  requirements of the statute, of course, the statute controls the rights of the\r\nparties.â€).\r\n[6]Â  With all due respect, in our view to concur in the\r\n  conclusion reached by the dissent would require an assumption of a holding in Unisun that is not evident in the opinion itself.Â  Moreover, it would require the\r\n  abandonment of a long-held position in our jurisprudence that the uninsured\r\n  motorist statute is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed.Â  See Unisun, 339 S.C. at 366, 529 S.E.2d at 282\r\n  (recognizing the uninsured motorist statute is remedial in nature); Inabinet,\r\n  165 S.C. at 36, 162 S.E. at 600 (â€œA statute remedial in nature should be\r\n  liberally construed in order to accomplish the object sought.â€).\r\nAlthough\r\n  the dissentâ€™s analysis may be â€œconsistentâ€ with our decision in Unisun,\r\n  it is clearly not the same.Â  The dissent posits â€œpassengers who were not\r\n  â€˜invitedâ€™ by one of these persons-the named insured, her resident relatives,\r\n  permissive users-are not guests and are therefore not insureds.â€Â  That is not\r\n  the holding in Unisun.Â  In Unisun, unlike here, the guest status\r\n  of the plaintiff was uncontested and the Court was not required to define\r\n  â€œguest.â€Â  Instead, the Court focused its analysis on permissive/consensual use\r\n  of the vehicle by the injured party versus non-permissive use of the driver.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  our view, the Unisun Court could have ended its analysis when it was\r\n  determined that Hurst, the injured party, was a guest.Â  As previously\r\n  discussed, section 38-77-30(7) does not in any way condition the status of\r\n  guest.Â  The statute clearly includes â€œa guest in the motor vehicle to which the\r\n  policy appliesâ€ as an insured.Â  \r\nThe Unisun Court clearly wanted to specifically deal with the Court of Appealsâ€™\r\n  pronouncement that a non-permissive driver negates uninsured coverage for\r\n  otherwise permissive/consensual passengers.\r\n[7]Unlike the majority, I am not persuaded that the\r\n  interpretation of this term in Â§ 38-77-30 (7) is impacted by the remedial\r\nnature of the uninsured motorist statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150.\r\n[8] One need only think of the implications where the\r\n  driver of a stolen vehicle invites passengers to ride along, and they are\r\nsubsequently involved in a serious accident. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26513","title":"In the Matter of Michael David Wood","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26513","description":"The Court in this opinion publicly reprimands Michael David Wood for misconduct.","date":"2008-06-30","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter\r\n          of Michael David Wood, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26513Â  \r\n  Submitted June 3, 2008 - Filed June 30,\r\n2008\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.

Respondent failed to notify the client that the case\r\n  had been dismissed and failed to restore the case within the time period set\r\n  forth in Rule 40, SCRCP.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    Respondent falsely\r\n  represented to the client he had filed suit on her behalf in another matter.&nbsp;\r\n  When he eventually filed the suit, he failed to effect service on the\r\n  defendants despite representing to the client that he had done so.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3. \r\n    In a matter before the\r\n  State Board of Education, respondent failed to notify the client of the Board&rsquo;s\r\n  decision to suspend her teaching certificate.&nbsp; The client did not learn of the\r\n  suspension until after the period for appeal had expired.&nbsp; In this same matter,\r\n  respondent recommended the client file suit against the Board and thereafter\r\n  assured her he had filed such a suit on her behalf when in fact he never filed\r\n  the suit.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.&nbsp;\r\n    Respondent assisted\r\n  the client in receiving a loan and signed as guarantor of the loan.&nbsp; When the\r\n  client refused to make further payments on the loan, respondent satisfied the\r\n  loan.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Respondent failed to\r\n      keep the client reasonably informed of the status of her cases and failed to\r\n      promptly comply with the client&rsquo;s reasonable requests for information.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall\r\n  provide competent representation, including the legal knowledge, skill,\r\n  thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation, to a\r\n  client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the\r\n  objectives of representation and consult with the client as to the means by\r\n  which they are to be pursued); Rule\r\n  1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall consult with a client about the\r\n  clientâ€™s case, keep the client reasonably informed about the case and promptly\r\n  respond to reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.8(e)(a lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a\r\n  client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that a\r\n  lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of\r\n  which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter and a lawyer representing\r\n  an indigent client may pay court costs and expenses of litigation on behalf of\r\n  the client); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent also admits that he has violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules\r\n  for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, by violating the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find a nine month suspension is the appropriate sanction for\r\n  respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for nine months.Â \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

State, 294 S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988), from an order denying and dismissing petitioner&rsquo;s application for post-conviction relief (PCR).  By order dated October 30, 2007, the Court of Appeals denied the petition. \r\n Thereafter, counsel for petitioner received two extensions of time to serve and file a petition for a writ of certiorari and appendix pursuant to Rule 226, SCACR, in this Court.  Meanwhile, this Court held in Haggins v. State, 377 S.C. 135, 659 S.E.2d 170 (2008), that it will not entertain a petition for a writ of certiorari pursuant to Rule 226 in a PCR matter where there has been a &ldquo;letter denial&rdquo; by the Court of Appeals.\r\n By order dated April 9, 2008, this matter was dismissed, pursuant to Haggins, on the ground that the Court of Appeals denied the petition for a writ of certiorari by letter without issuing a formal order or opinion.  The Court of Appeals sent the remittitur to the lower court on April 10, 2008.\t\t\t\r\nPetitioner now asks the Court to reconsider its decision, recall the remittitur and reinstate the matter.  Specifically, petitioner argues Haggins is inapplicable to his case because his petition was denied by way of an order.  Petitioner argues further that the Court should recall the remittitur and grant reinstatement because the Court had already granted him two extensions of time, he had completed work on the petition at the time the order of dismissal was issued, his case involves substantial meritorious issues for appellate review, and the rule set forth in Haggins should not be applied to PCR appeals already before the Court.  Finally, petitioner argues application of Haggins to his case would violate his rights to due process and equal protection.\r\n Initially, we agree that this matter should not have been dismissed pursuant to Haggins since the Court of Appeals disposed of the petition for a writ of certiorari by way of an order instead of a letter denial.  However, we hereby extend Haggins to petitions for a writ of certiorari filed in this Court pursuant to Rule 226 following the Court of Appeals&rsquo; issuance of an order denying a petition for a writ of certiorari filed pursuant to Johnson v. State, supra in a PCR matter.  We find neither Haggins, nor our extension of Haggins herein, constitutes a violation of constitutional rights.  Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974); Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examiners, 370 S.C. 452, 636 S.E.2d 598 (2006); Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 359 S.C. 85, 596 S.E.2d 917 (2004); Rule 226(b), SCACR; 16C C.J.S. Constitutional Law &sect; 1691 (2005).  Finally, petitioner&rsquo;s argument that Haggins should not apply to his case because it was already pending before the Court at the time the decision in Haggins was issued, and because petitioner had already invested time and resources in preparing the petition, ignores the fact that this Court applied the new rule set forth in Haggins to Haggins himself, indicating our intent for the rule to be applied to all Rule 226 petitions in PCR appeals regardless of how far along in the process they may be.  For that reason, we find it appropriate to apply our extension of the rule announced herein to petitioner&rsquo;s case and deny petitioner&rsquo;s motion to recall the remittitur and reinstate the petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    s/Jean H.
