Entertainments, \r\n  LLC., d/b/a Club Tango, and Letâ€™s Eat, Inc., d/b/a Port Side Cafe Uptown (Businesses) \r\n  brought this action challenging Appellant The City of Charlestonâ€™s (the Cityâ€™s) \r\n  Municipal Code Section 3-2 (the Ordinance).  Among other claims, Businesses \r\n  asserted state law, particularly South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 61-2-80 (Supp. 2001), \r\n  preempted the Ordinance.  The trial judge granted Businesses summary judgment \r\n  on their preemption claim and enjoined the City from enforcing the Ordinance.  \r\n  We reverse.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the General Assembly intend to preempt the regulation of hours of operation \r\n  of retailers of beer, ale, porter and/or wine by enacting South Carolina Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 61-2-80 (Supp. 2001)?  \r\n  II.&nbsp; \r\n  Is the Ordinance inconsistent with South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-120 (Supp. \r\n  2001)? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDetermining whether a local ordinance is valid is a \r\n  two-step process.  Bugsyâ€™s v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 87, 530 \r\n  S.E.2d 890 (2000).  The Court first considers whether the municipality had the \r\n  power to enact the ordinance.  If the State has preempted a particular area \r\n  of legislation, a municipality is without power to regulate the field.  Id.  \r\n  If the municipality had the power to enact the ordinance, the Court then determines \r\n  whether the ordinance is consistent with the Constitution and general law of \r\n  the State.  Id.  \r\nI.\r\nThe City \r\n  argues the trial judge erred by holding the Ordinance is preempted by state \r\n  law.  We agree.\r\nThe Ordinance provides:\r\n\r\nCommercial establishments which \r\n  allow for the on-premises consumption of beer, ale, porter and/or wine shall \r\n  be prohibited from operating between the hours of 2 A.M. and 6 A.M. on Mondays \r\n  through Saturdays. [1]    \r\n\r\nSection 61-2-80 provides:\r\n\r\nThe department [Department of \r\n  Revenue (DOR)] is the sole and exclusive authority empowered to regulate the \r\n  operation of all retail locations authorized to sell beer, wine, or alcoholic \r\n  liquors and is authorized to establish conditions or restrictions which the \r\n  department considers necessary before issuing or renewing a license or permit. \r\n  . . .  \r\n\r\nIn construing \r\n  statutory language, the statute must be read as a whole and sections which are \r\n  part of the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one \r\n  given effect.  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 \r\n  S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998).  The Court must presume the legislature did \r\n  not intend a futile act, but rather intended its statutes to accomplish something.  \r\n  Id.  \r\nâ€œ[I]n order to pre-empt an entire field, an act must \r\n  make manifest a legislative intent that no other enactment may touch upon the \r\n  subject in any way.â€  Town of Hilton Head Island v. Fine Liquors, Ltd., \r\n  302 S.C. 550, 552, 397 S.E.2d 662, 663 (1990). [2]   In Fine Liquors, the \r\n  Court concluded the predecessor to Â§ 61-2-80 did not indicate â€œthe legislature \r\n  intended to pre-empt the field, thereby precluding municipalities from passing \r\n  any ordinance which affected the operation of liquor stores.â€ \r\n  [3]   Id.  Accordingly, the Court has already ruled on the issue \r\n  presented by this appeal.  Id.\r\nFurthermore, Â§ 61-2-80 was re-enacted after the issuance \r\n  of Fine Liquors.  Act No. 415 Â§ 1, 1996 S.C. Acts 2459.  Had the General \r\n  Assembly disagreed with our decision in Fine Liquors, it would have clearly \r\n  stated its position that the DOR occupies the entire field of beer and wine \r\n  regulation as it did in enacting Â§ 61-6-4490 (Supp. 2001) (â€œOrdinances of political \r\n  subdivisions of this State prohibiting the acts prohibited by the provisions \r\n  of this article. . . are hereby suspended, it being declared that the State \r\n  has occupied the field of the subject covered thereby.â€) (Underline added).\r\n Finally, \r\n  Â§ 61-4-120 generally prohibits Sunday sales of beer and wine and provides â€œ[m]unicipal \r\n  ordinances in conflict with this section are unenforceable.â€ [4]   By passing Â§ 61-4-120 with Â§ \r\n  61-2-80, the General Assembly recognized that municipalities have authority \r\n  to regulate the hours of operation of retailers of beer and wine.  It would \r\n  have been unnecessary for the legislature to refer to municipalitiesâ€™ authority \r\n  to regulate the hours of operation of retail sales of beer and wine if the General \r\n  Assembly intended to occupy the entire field.  See AmVets Post 100 \r\n  v. Richland County Council, 280 S.C. 317, 313 S.E.2d 293 (1984) (state statute \r\n  contemplated further regulation of bingo by counties as it referred to licensing \r\n  by counties).   \r\nII.\r\nThe City \r\n  argues the Ordinance is consistent with the Constitution and general law of \r\n  the State.  We agree.\r\n In relevant part, Â§ 61-4-120 provides:\r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for a person to \r\n  sell or offer for sale wine or beer in this State between the hours of twelve \r\n  oâ€™clock Saturday night and sunrise Monday morning. . . . Municipal ordinances \r\n  in conflict with this section are unenforceable.  \r\n\r\nAs a general \r\n  rule, â€œadditional regulation to that of State law does not constitute a conflict \r\n  therewith.â€  Town of Hilton Head Island v. Fine Liquors, Ltd., supra \r\n  302 S.C. at 553, 397 S.E.2d at 664 quoting Arnold v. City of Spartanburg, \r\n  201 S.C. 523, 536, 23 S.E.2d 735, 740 (1943). \r\nFurther, \r\n\r\n[I]n order for there to be a \r\n  conflict between a state statute and a municipal ordinance â€˜both must contain \r\n  either express or implied conditions which are inconsistent or irreconcilable \r\n  with each other.  Mere differences in detail do not render them conflicting.  \r\n  If either is silent where the other speaks, there can be no conflict between \r\n  them.  Where no conflict exists, both laws stand.â€™\r\n\r\nFine Liquors, supra, \r\n  quoting McAbee v. Southern Ry. Co., 166 S.C. 166, 169-70. 164 \r\n  S.E. 444, 445 (1932).  \r\nIn City \r\n  of Charleston v. Jenkins, 243 S.C. 205, 133 S.E.2d 242 (1963), the Court \r\n  determined a city ordinance which prohibited businesses from on premises service \r\n  or consumption of any wines or malt liquors between 1:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. \r\n  did not conflict with a state statute making it unlawful to sell wine or beer \r\n  between midnight Saturday and sunrise Monday.  Noting the ordinance merely imposed \r\n  additional requirements on commercial establishments in the city, the Court \r\n  concluded the ordinance was neither inconsistent nor irreconcilable with the \r\n  State statute and its passage was a proper and valid exercise of the cityâ€™s \r\n  police power.    \r\n Jenkins \r\n  controls our decision on this issue.  While the Ordinance differs in scope from \r\n  Â§ 61-4-120 (the ordinance prohibits operation from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. on \r\n  Mondays through Saturdays while the statute prohibits sales from midnight on \r\n  Saturday through sunrise on Monday), the two are neither inconsistent nor irreconcilable.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, \r\n  Â§ 61-4-120 does not impliedly provide Businesses with a â€œrightâ€ to sell beer \r\n  and wine at all times other than at those hours prohibited by the statute.  \r\n  As noted in Jenkins, the commercial establishments did not have the right \r\n  to sell beer and wine at all hours other than those specifically prohibited \r\n  by the state statute.  \r\nFinally, \r\n  we note that if an ordinance unreasonably prohibits the sale of beer and wine, \r\n  in effect banning a business which the State has deemed legal, the ordinance \r\n  would exceed the police power of the municipality and be unenforceable. [5]   Id.  The Ordinance presently \r\n  before the Court does not exceed the Cityâ€™s authority.  \r\nThe decision \r\n  of the trial judge is REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    The Ordinance was ratified on July 18, 2000, and took effect 180 days later.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Since Fine Liquors, the Court has held the legislature intended to \r\n    preempt the entire field of bail bondsman regulation through a statute providing \r\n    &quot;[no] license may be issued to a professional bondsman or runner except \r\n    as provided in this chapter.&quot;  Wrenn Bail Bond Service, Inc., v. City \r\n    of Hanahan, 335 S.C. 26, 515 S.E.2d 521 (1999).  We have also determined \r\n    a statute manifested a clear legislative intent for the State to preempt the \r\n    regulation of watercraft on navigable waters where the statute specified any \r\n    local laws must be identical to the state provisions.  Barnhill v. City \r\n    of North Myrtle Beach, 333 S.C. 482, 511 S.E.2d 361 (1999).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    Section Â§ 61-2-80 and its predecessor, Â§ 61-5-190 (1990), are essentially \r\n    the same except that the earlier statute empowered the South Carolina Alcoholic \r\n    Beverage Control Commission, rather than the DOR, with authority to regulate \r\n    the operation of retail liquor stores.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    As addressed below, this Section does not impliedly permit beer and wine retailers \r\n    to operate at all times other than those prohibited by statute, but rather \r\n    precludes municipalities from permitting beer and wine retailers to operate \r\n    on Sunday.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (Supp. 2001).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25564","title":"State v.

The trial judge sentenced \r\n  Petitioner to three life sentences for the kidnapping and armed robbery convictions, \r\n  ten years for grand larceny, and three years for failing to stop for a blue \r\n  light, with all sentences to run concurrently.  \r\nOn appeal, Petitioner contested certain evidentiary rulings as well as a jury \r\n  charge.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial because \r\n  of evidentiary errors, but held the jury charge that â€œorders of anotherâ€ is \r\n  no defense to a crime was proper in this case.  State v. Blurton, 342 \r\n  S.C. 500, 537 S.E.2d 291 (Ct. App. 2000).  We denied the stateâ€™s petition for \r\n  certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ reversal of evidentiary rulings.  \r\n  We granted Petitionerâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari to review the propriety \r\n  of the jury charge.  We reverse because we find the charge was not warranted \r\n  by the facts adduced at trial.   \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner worked at a Wal-Mart in Orangeburg as a \r\n  construction worker during the expansion of the building.  Petitionerâ€™s wife \r\n  managed the toy section of the same Wal-Mart, and her daytime manager was James \r\n  Mayfield. \r\nThere was evidence that James Mayfield convinced Petitioner that Mayfield was \r\n  a former Navy SEAL, and was currently working for the Central Intelligence Agency \r\n  (â€œCIAâ€). Mayfield told Petitioner that the CIA was interested in recruiting \r\n  Petitioner as an agent.  Petitioner maintained at trial that he believed he \r\n  was involved in a complicated CIA operation called â€œDouble Whiteâ€ which required \r\n  Petitioner to stage a robbery in order to establish his outlaw status so that \r\n  he could more easily infiltrate a drug cartel.  Petitioner testified that Mayfield \r\n  told Petitioner that the sheriffâ€™s department in Orangeburg was involved with \r\n  the drug cartel, and the staged robbery must look real so that the sheriffâ€™s \r\n  department would report the robbery back to the cartel. \r\nPetitioner testified that the plan was to seek out Roger, another employee \r\n  of the Wal-Mart, who knew of the plan, and that Roger would lead Petitioner \r\n  to the â€œcash room.â€  Petitioner maintained at trial that Mayfield told Petitioner \r\n  not to wear a mask or gloves, and to make sure the cameras in the store caught \r\n  the robbery on tape so the drug cartel would know that Petitioner robbed the \r\n  store.  Petitioner testified that he believed the money taken from Wal-Mart \r\n  would be recovered and returned immediately to the store.  He testified, â€œit \r\n  wasnâ€™t a robbery.  I never believed it was a robbery.  If I would have believed \r\n  it was a robbery I wouldnâ€™t have went in thereâ€¦it was just to appear to be a \r\n  robbery, but they werenâ€™t going to let me keep the money.â€  Petitioner testified \r\n  that Mayfield told Petitioner to go to a motel in town after the staged robbery, \r\n  and Mayfield would meet Petitioner there, recover the money, and the CIA would \r\n  return the money to Wal-Mart. \r\nPetitioner admits that he went into the Orangeburg Wal-Mart, where both he \r\n  and his wife worked, armed with a handgun.  Roger, his contact, was not working \r\n  that day, so Petitioner met Brandon, another manager, whom Mayfield said also \r\n  knew about the plan.  Petitioner testified he pointed the gun at Brandon and \r\n  ordered him into the cash room, making sure the cameras could see the gun. Once \r\n  Petitioner entered the cash room, he was supposed to take all of the money in \r\n  the room, which was over one hundred thousand dollars. However, Petitioner testified \r\n  that once he entered the room, he realized his wifeâ€™s best friend, Brenda, was \r\n  counting the money.  At this point, Petitioner â€œdeviatedâ€ from the plan. Petitioner \r\n  testified that instead of taking all of the money, which he easily could have, \r\n  he took only the one dollar bills which were stacked on a table in the cash \r\n  room, totaling eight thousand five hundred dollars and five cents. This is the \r\n  basis of the first armed robbery count.\r\nPetitioner further admits that he forced Brandon to walk outside the store \r\n  and into the parking lot after the money was taken.  However, Petitioner testified \r\n  that â€œBrandon was supposed to come with me, to walk outside the store.  This \r\n  was part of the planâ€¦because they have a girl that stands there. When you walk \r\n  out of Wal-Mart she checks your bags. I had a big bag of money.  If Iâ€™m not \r\n  walking with the manager out the door, sheâ€™s going to check the bag, and itâ€™s \r\n  going to create confusionâ€¦â€ This act is the basis of the kidnapping charge.  \r\n\r\nOnce out of the store, Petitioner testified he believed someone from the CIA \r\n  was going to pick him up, because he did not have a car.  A white Mercedes pulled \r\n  up and parked right next to Petitioner, and Petitioner testified â€œ[he] thought \r\n  [his] ride was here.â€ A woman got out of the car, began screaming, and threw \r\n  her purse and keys at Petitioner.  This is the basis of the second armed robbery \r\n  charge.  Petitioner testified, â€œI figured it was for showâ€¦.â€ \r\nPetitioner took the car, and proceeded to evade the police.  Petitioner testified \r\n  that Mayfield told him a CIA agent would intercept the local police so that \r\n  Petitioner would not get caught.  This is the basis for the grand larceny of \r\n  a motor vehicle charge, and the failure to stop for a blue light charge.  \r\nPetitioner admitted to all of these facts, but maintained that he thought he \r\n  was working for the CIA, and therefore did not have the requisite mens rea \r\n  to commit any crime.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in \r\n  holding the trial court properly instructed the jury that it is no defense to \r\n  a crime if it was done under the instructions of another?  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe trial judge instructed the jury on the requisite mens rea, and then \r\n  added, â€œif one committed a criminal act it is no defense to show that it was \r\n  done under the instructions or orders from another.  Likewise, it is no defense \r\n  to a criminal act if it be shown that it was done in partnership or cooperation \r\n  with another person.â€  \r\nPetitioner argued at trial that he lacked the mens rea necessary \r\n  to complete the crime.  â€œCriminal liability is normally based upon the concurrence \r\n  of two factors, â€˜an evil meaning mind [and] an evil doing hand.â€™â€ State v. \r\n  Jeffries, 316 S.C. 13, 18, 446 S.E.2d 427, 430 (1994) (internal citations \r\n  omitted). Petitioner did not argue that Mayfield instructed him to commit a \r\n  crime, but rather that because Petitioner thought the entire event was a staged \r\n  CIA operation, it was not a criminal act as he lacked the â€˜evil meaning mindâ€™.  \r\n  Because the jury instruction given was not implicated by the facts in this case, \r\n  we hold it was error to charge the jury the â€œorders of anotherâ€ instruction. \r\n\r\nThe evidence presented at trial determines the charged jury instruction.  State \r\n  v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 380 S.E.2d 834 (1989).  The purpose of a jury instruction \r\n  is â€œto enlighten the jury and to aid it in arriving at a correct verdict.  It \r\n  is error to give instructions which are calculated to confuse or mislead the \r\n  jury.â€  State v. Leonard, 292 S.C. 133, 137, 355 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1987). \r\n  If a jury instruction is provided to the jury that does not fit the facts of \r\n  the case, it may confuse the jury.  State v. Lee, Id.; State \r\n  v. Hewitt, 205 S.C. 207, 31 S.E.2d 257 (1944).  Only law applicable to the \r\n  case should be charged to the jury.  Instructions that do not fit the facts \r\n  of the case may serve only to confuse the jury.  State v. Lee, Id.; \r\n  State v. Fair, 209 S.C. 439, 40 S.E.2d 634 (1946); State v. Rivers, \r\n  186 S.C. 221, 196 S.E. 6 (1938).  We hold based upon the evidence introduced \r\n  in this case, that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the â€œorders of anotherâ€ \r\n  instruction. [1]   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals holding that the â€œorders of anotherâ€ charge was proper \r\n  under the evidence adduced.  On retrial we are confident that the trial court \r\n  will appropriately instruct the jury based upon the evidence presented.  \r\nREVERSED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER\r\nand PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The â€œorders of anotherâ€ jury charge, is a correct \r\n    proposition of law.

Major, all of South Carolina \r\n  Department of Revenue, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: \r\n  Fraternal Order of Police et. al. (â€œTaxpayersâ€) challenge the constitutionality \r\n  of  the Bingo Act of 1989 (â€œ1989 Actâ€), \r\n  [1]  and two additional bingo statutes enacted after the 1989 Act, S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-21-3441 and 12-21-3610 (Supp. 1995). \r\n  [2]   Taxpayers brought their challenge in an effort to recover taxes paid \r\n  to the South Carolina Department of Revenue (â€œthe Departmentâ€) pursuant to these \r\n  statutes between July 1, 1992, and October 1, 1997.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nThe parties have stipulated to the relevant \r\n  facts.  The Taxpayers first filed an action in 1993 challenging the 1989 Act \r\n  on both constitutional and non-constitutional grounds.  The Taxpayers did not \r\n  exhaust their administrative remedies by filing a claim for a refund for taxes \r\n  paid, and the case was dismissed in 1994 with leave to restore.  Taxpayers filed \r\n  a refund claim in 1995, and raised all of the non-constitutional claims from \r\n  the 1993 action.  The Department denied the refund claim, and the Taxpayers \r\n  appealed all the way to this Court.  This Court affirmed on two of the three \r\n  non-constitutional issues, and reversed on a third.  Fraternal Order of Police \r\n  v. South Carolina Dept. of Rev., 332 S.C. 496, 506 S.E.2d 495 (1998) (â€œFOP \r\n  Iâ€). [3]   \r\nIn 1997, the Taxpayers filed a motion \r\n  to have their 1993 claim reinstated in order to move forward on the constitutional \r\n  causes of action not addressed in FOP I.  The motion was granted, and \r\n  this Court denied the Departmentâ€™s appeal as interlocutory.  The Taxpayersâ€™ \r\n  original 1993 complaint was reinstated, but the parties stipulated that they \r\n  were only raising the constitutional challenges to equal protection and due \r\n  process within the original complaint. [4]   \r\nIn addition to the 1989 Act, the Taxpayers \r\n  are challenging the constitutionality of South Carolina Code sections 12-21-3441 \r\n  and 12-21-3610, enacted after the 1989 Act, in 1991 and 1992 respectively.  \r\n  With the exception of section 12-21-3440, the 1989 Act is regulatory in nature.  \r\n  It establishes various rules relating to record keeping, regulation of promoters, \r\n  location of games, and size of payouts.  Section 12-21-3440 both regulates and \r\n  taxes bingo.  Section 12-21-3440(A) creates various classes of bingo license \r\n  holders and specifies certain rules as to each class, including assessing differing \r\n  license taxes for the individual classes.  Section 12-21-3440(B), strictly a \r\n  revenue statute, assesses a bingo tax on the various classes of bingo license \r\n  holders.\r\nThe Taxpayers were all licensed bingo \r\n  operators under the 1989 Act, holding either Class AA or Class B licenses.  \r\n  Under the 1989 Act, Class AA operators were allowed to conduct one bingo session \r\n  per month with a minimum prize payment of $50,000 and a maximum of $250,000.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-3440(A)(1) (Supp. 1994).  The Taxpayers holding a Class \r\n  B license were allowed to conduct three bingo games per week, but were limited \r\n  to a maximum payout of $8,000 per session.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-3440(A)(2) \r\n  (Supp. 1994).\r\n The additional statutes challenged, sections 12-21-3441 \r\n  and 12-21-3610, are both revenue provisions.  Section 12-21-3441 assesses an \r\n  additional bingo tax on holders of Class AA and Class B licenses.  Section 12-21-3610 \r\n  assesses a sales tax on the gross proceeds derived from bingo. \r\nThe Taxpayers and the Department presented \r\n  arguments before the circuit court on the constitutional claims on February \r\n  7, 2000.  The parties did not call any witnesses.  On April 6, 2000, the circuit \r\n  court ruled in favor of the Department on all issues and dismissed the Taxpayersâ€™ \r\n  claims with prejudice.  The following issues are raised on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;\r\n        \r\n       Did the Circuit Court err in failing to find that Article\r\n        XVII, \r\n  Â§ 7 of the South Carolina Constitution made bingo a non-lottery game, and, consequently, \r\n  conferred a constitutional right upon Taxpayers to conduct bingo?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the Circuit Court err in failing to \r\n  find the 1989 Act and S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-21-3441 and 12-21-3610 (Supp. 1994) \r\n  violated Taxpayersâ€™ rights to Equal Protection, Due Process, and Free Speech?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       III.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the Circuit Court err in failing to find that Article\r\n        XVII, \r\n  Â§ 7 of the South Carolina Constitution impliedly exempts Taxpayers from taxation \r\n  under the 1989 Act and S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-21-3441 and 12-21-3610?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       IV.\r\n       Are the Taxpayers claims barred by res judicata?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw Analysis\r\nI. Right to Conduct Bingo\r\nThe Taxpayers argue that the 1974 amendment \r\n  to Article XVII, Â§ 7 of the South Carolina Constitution made bingo a non-lottery \r\n  game, and consequently conferred upon them a right to conduct bingo.  We disagree.\r\nArticle XVII, Â§ 7 of the South Carolina \r\n  Constitution provides,\r\n\r\nNo lottery shall ever be allowed or be advertised by newspapers, or \r\n  otherwise, or its tickets be sold in this State.  The game of bingo, \r\n  when conducted by charitable, religious or fraternal organizations exempt from \r\n  federal income taxation or when conducted at recognized annual State or county \r\n  fairs, shall not be deemed a lottery prohibited by this section.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. XVII, Â§ 7 (1976) (emphasis added). [5]   When construing the constitution, \r\n  the Court applies rules similar to those relating to the construction of statutes.  \r\n  Davis v. County of Greenville, 313 S.C. 459, 443 S.E.2d 383 (1994).  \r\n  In interpreting statutes, the Court must give statutory language its plain and \r\n  ordinary meaning.  FOP I, 332 S.C. at 499, 506 S.E.2d at 496 (citations \r\n  omitted). \r\n This Court addressed bingoâ€™s status as \r\n  a lottery in Army Navy Bingo, Garrison No. 2196 v. Plowden, 281 S.C. \r\n  226, 314 S.E.2d 339 (1984).  In Army Navy Bingo, bingo operators challenged \r\n  the constitutionality of the prize limitations and the residence requirement \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2590, arguing that the provisions violated the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment due process clause.  In denying any due process violation, the Court \r\n  held, â€œ[s]ection 7 is not a self-executing constitutional grant of power to \r\n  conduct bingo.  On the contrary, [it] indicates that bingo is no longer constitutionally \r\n  prohibited.â€  Army Navy Bingo, 281 S.C. at 228, 314 S.E.2d at \r\n  340.  The Court then concluded,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\nBingo is a lottery, and it is gambling.  There \r\n  is no right to conduct bingo under the State Constitution.\r\nNor is there a fundamental right to gamble protected by the Federal \r\n  Constitution.  In fact, the Stateâ€™s power to suppress gambling is practically \r\n  unrestrained.\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).\r\nThe Taxpayers concede that finding that \r\n  bingo is not a lottery, and, therefore, is not gambling, is central to their \r\n  argument that the 1989 Act violates their constitutional rights to due process \r\n  and equal protection. The Taxpayers attempt to circumvent the seemingly clear \r\n  language to the contrary in Army Navy Bingo by arguing that this Court \r\n  was not talking about traditional bingo when it said â€œ[b]ingo is a lottery, \r\n  and it is gambling.â€  281 S.C. at 228, 314 S.E.2d at 340.  The Taxpayers base \r\n  this contention solely on Army Navy Bingoâ€™s citation to Bingo Bank, \r\n  Inc. v. J. P. Strom, 268 S.C. 498, 234 S.E.2d 881 (1977).    \r\nIn Bingo Bank, the Court addressed \r\n  whether the game being played qualified as the bingo permitted under the Constitution.  \r\n  The Court found that the game being played in Bingo Bank was not, in \r\n  fact, the traditional game of bingo contemplated by the Constitution.  268 S.C. \r\n  at 503, 234 S.E.2d at 883.  Taxpayers argue, then, that the Courtâ€™s citation \r\n  to Bingo Bank in Army Navy Bingo for the proposition that bingo \r\n  is a lottery and is gambling is misplaced in the context of the traditional \r\n  bingo contemplated in and permitted by the Constitution.  \r\n In our opinion, Taxpayersâ€™ argument is \r\n  unconvincing.  The Courtâ€™s statement in Army Navy Bingo is not a quote \r\n  from Bingo Bank.  Although Bingo Bank involved a game that is \r\n  not encompassed in the Constitutionâ€™s definition of bingo, the game in Army \r\n  Navy Bingo was traditional bingo.  Further, the Court repeated this interpretation \r\n  in Johnson v. Collins Entertainment, Co., 332 S.C. 96, 508 S.E.2d 575 \r\n  (1998).  In Johnson, decided long after the 1974 amendment and \r\n  Army Navy Bingo, the Court noted that bingo is commonly defined and understood \r\n  to be a lottery.  Johnson, 332 S.C. 96, 508 S.E.2d 575 (citing Encarta \r\n  97 Encyclopedia (Microsoft deluxe ed. 1996); 2 The New Encyclopedia Brittanica \r\n  218 (15th ed. 1997)).  In his dissent, Justice Burnett expounded, â€œ[i]n fact, \r\n  with the passage of the constitutional amendment in 1974, the citizens of this \r\n  State specifically recognized that the game of bingo is a lottery prohibited \r\n  by Article XVII, Â§ 7.  By adopting the amendment, the citizens of South Carolina \r\n  legalized the playing of bingo in certain limited circumstances.â€  Id. at \r\n  107, 508 S.E.2d at 581 (Burnett, J., dissenting).\r\n We believe this Court carefully considered \r\n  its statement in Army Navy Bingo, a case involving traditional bingo, \r\n  when it declared, in no uncertain terms, that â€œ[b]ingo is a lottery, and it \r\n  is gambling.â€  The 1974 amendment to Article XVII simply makes a limited exception \r\n  for bingo, as a lottery, from this Stateâ€™s constitutional prohibition \r\n  against lotteries.  The plain meaning of the portion of Article XVII, Â§ 7 that \r\n  reads, â€œbingo . . . shall not be deemed a lottery prohibited by this sectionâ€ \r\n  is that bingo remains a lottery, but is a lottery that is not prohibited by \r\n  the Constitution.  \r\n The Taxpayersâ€™ argument that they have \r\n  a constitutional right to conduct bingo flows from the principle that conducting \r\n  bingo is a privilege granted by the Constitution.  This premise is flawed.  \r\n  As discussed, in Army Navy Bingo, this Court held that bingo is a lottery \r\n  and is gambling; that there is no right to gamble under the State Constitution; \r\n  that there is no â€œfundamental right to gambleâ€ under the Federal Constitution; \r\n  and that â€œthe Stateâ€™s power to suppress gambling is practically unrestrained.â€  \r\n  Army Navy Bingo, 281 S.C. at 228, 314 S.E.2d at 340 (citing Lewis v. \r\n  United States, 348 U.S. 419, 75 S.Ct. 415, 99 L.Ed.2d 475 (1955); Sin \r\n  v. Wittman, 198 U.S. 500, 25 S.Ct. 756, 49 L.Ed. 1142 (1905)).  The Taxpayers \r\n  do not address this direct precedent, and concede that finding bingo is not \r\n  a lottery, and, therefore, is not gambling is central to their case.  \r\n\r\n In our opinion, there is no support for \r\n  the Taxpayers argument against the precedent set in Army Navy Bingo and \r\n  in Johnson v. Collins.     \r\nII. Violation of Constitutional Rights\r\n The Taxpayers argue the 1989 Act and \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-21-3441 and 12-21-3610 violate their constitutional rights \r\n  to equal protection, due process, and free speech.  \r\nA. Equal Protection\r\n The Taxpayers contend that the circuit \r\n  court erred in failing to find the statutes at issue violated equal protection. \r\n  [6]   We disagree.\r\n This Court recognizes that â€œthe determination \r\n  of whether a classification is reasonable is initially one for the legislature \r\n  and will not be set aside by the courts unless it is plainly arbitrary.â€  Gary \r\n  Concrete Products, Inc. v. Riley, 285 S.C. 498, 504, 331 S.E.2d 335, 338 \r\n  (1985).  The requirements of equal protection are satisfied as long as (1) the \r\n  classification bears a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose sought \r\n  to be effected; (2) the members of the class are treated alike under similar \r\n  circumstances and conditions; and (3) the classification rests on some reasonable \r\n  basis.  Id.  According to the United States Supreme Court,  \r\n\r\n[u]nless a classification trammels fundamental personal rights or is \r\n  drawn upon inherently suspect distinctions such as race, religion, or alienage, \r\n  our decisions presume the constitutionality of the statutory discriminations \r\n  and require only that the classification challenged be rationally related to \r\n  a legitimate state interest.\r\n\r\nCity of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, \r\n  303-04, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2516-17, 49 L.Ed.2d 511, 517 (1976).\r\nThe Taxpayers allege classifying them \r\n  as bingo charities, and placing additional regulations and taxes on them as \r\n  bingo charities violates equal protection.  Applying the rational basis standard, \r\n  the circuit court found Taxpayers were not treated differently as they received \r\n  the same property tax exemptions as other charities and received identical tax \r\n  treatment when engaged in the same activities as other charities.  The circuit \r\n  court found the fundraising activity of playing bingo was what was treated differently, \r\n  and that all charities that conducted bingo were treated alike.  The circuit \r\n  court held that the legislatureâ€™s stated purpose in enacting the statutes at \r\n  issue, regulation and taxation of bingo, was a legitimate legislative purpose, \r\n  and that the statutes were rationally related to achieving the stated purpose. \r\n   [7] \r\n Taxpayers argue that regulation of bingo \r\n  is not a legitimate purpose because the statutes designed to regulate bingo \r\n  interfere with the Taxpayers right to play bingo.  Assuming arguendo \r\n  the 1989 Act did have a proper purpose, Taxpayers contend it is not rationally \r\n  related to achieving that objective.  We disagree.  Applying the rational basis \r\n  test to both the regulatory and revenue provisions of the 1989 Act and sections \r\n  12-21-3441 and 12-21-3610, the requirements of equal protection are satisfied.  \r\n  In our opinion, the regulation of bingo is a legitimate state purpose, the regulations \r\n  within the 1989 Acts are rationally related to that purpose, and all charities \r\n  that conduct bingo are treated alike under the statute. \r\n First, the Tax Commissionâ€™s 1992 Bingo \r\n  Task Force Report, â€œBingo in South Carolina: Who Really Benefits?â€ \r\n  [8]  (admitted without objection), makes clear that bingo can invite criminal \r\n  activity and fraud, including organized crime, as it involves large sums of \r\n  cash, and, therefore, that it justifies state regulation.  The Task Force found \r\n  that bingo required â€œaggressive enforcementâ€ to avoid criminal activity and \r\n  even recommended additional regulation of the industry for the same reason. [9]   Second, the regulations are rationally related \r\n  to regulating bingo to prevent the proliferation of crime.  Requiring charities \r\n  that wish to conduct bingo to file an application for a license, for example, \r\n  helps the state monitor what groups are playing bingo and at what level.  Third, \r\n  all charities that conduct bingo are subjected to the same regulations, and \r\n  so are treated similarly for purposes of equal protection.  Although Class AA \r\n  and Class B license holders pay higher taxes, and pay a sales tax on their gross \r\n  proceeds that Class E holders are not required to pay, these distinctions are \r\n  justified because Class AA and Class B holders receive advantages that the other \r\n  classes do not.  Class AA and Class B holders can give much larger prize payouts, \r\n  attract more players, and, in turn, raise more revenue. \r\n  [10]   \r\n The justification for the challenged \r\n  revenue statutes is much the same, but the burden of proving tax classifications \r\n  unconstitutional is even more difficult for the Taxpayer to meet.  For tax statutes, \r\n  â€œthe presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit \r\n  demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination \r\n  against particular persons and classes.â€  Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U.S. \r\n  83, 88, 60  S.Ct. 406, 408, 84 L. Ed. 590 (1940).  The purpose of the tax statutes \r\n  is to raise revenue.  If the Court finds regulating bingo is legitimate, it \r\n  follows that taxing bingo to raise revenue is legitimate as such revenue is \r\n  needed to cover the costs of the stateâ€™s regulation.  As the Supreme Court noted \r\n  in Madden, â€œ[t]raditionally classification has been a device for fitting \r\n  tax programs to local needs and usages in order to achieve an equitable distribution \r\n  of the tax burden.â€  Id.  Under this theory, the taxing statutes at issue \r\n  are rationally related to raising revenue, as are the classifications within \r\n  them that distinguish between the different classes of licensees, because they \r\n  raise revenue according to how much money each class of license holders is likely \r\n  to make.\r\n Additionally, Taxpayers contend that \r\n  the circuit court erred in applying the rational basis standard, and should \r\n  have applied some form of heightened scrutiny.  We disagree.\r\n As discussed, strict scrutiny is indicated \r\n  when â€œa classification trammels fundamental personal rights or is drawn upon \r\n  inherently suspect distinctions such as race, religion, or alienage.â€  City \r\n  of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. at 303, 96 S.Ct. at 2516, 49 L.Ed.2d at \r\n  517.  Taxpayers cite no authority for the proposition that conducting bingo \r\n  is a fundamental right, and it is difficult to conceive how conducting bingo \r\n  could be considered a personal right, on the same level as the right \r\n  to freedom of religion, for example.  Regardless, this is not a novel issue.  \r\n  As discussed, this Court has held that bingo is still gambling, that there is \r\n  no fundamental right to gamble under the South Carolina Constitution or the \r\n  Federal Constitution, and that â€œthe Stateâ€™s power to suppress gambling is practically \r\n  unrestrained.â€  Army Navy Bingo, 281 S.C. at 228, 314 S.E.2d at 340.  \r\n  Under this precedent, heightened scrutiny is not justified.\r\nB. Due Process\r\n Taxpayers argue that the 1989 Act and \r\n  sections 12-21-3441 and 12-21-3610 violate their rights to due process of law \r\n  by effectively depriving them of the right to conduct bingo. \r\n  [11]   We disagree.\r\n In R.L. Jordan, Inc. v. Boardman Petroleum, \r\n  Inc., this Court adopted the modern test for substantive due process challenges \r\n  to social and economic welfare legislation.  338 S.C. 475, 527 S.E.2d 763 (2000).  \r\n  Noting that modern rules give great deference to legislative judgment to promote \r\n  public welfare, this Court adopted the modern standard for reviewing all substantive \r\n  due process challenges to state statutes.   Id.  Under R.L. Jordan, \r\n  â€œlegislation is not overturned unless the law has no rational relationship to \r\n  any legitimate interest of government.â€  Id. at 477-78, 527 S.E.2d at \r\n  765.\r\n For the same reasons that regulating \r\n  and taxing bingo are legitimate objectives for purposes of equal protection, \r\n  we find they are legitimate for purposes of due process.  The Taxpayersâ€™ due \r\n  process challenge is based on the faulty premise that bingo is not a lottery, \r\n  and cannot be regulated as such, and that Article XVII, Â§ 7 of our Constitution \r\n  created a fundamental right to play bingo.  As discussed at length, this \r\n  Court has already decided that there is no right to play bingo.  Army Navy \r\n  Bingo.   This Court tried to put this question to rest in Army Navy Bingo, \r\n  by stating that bingo can only be conducted by license, and that the license \r\n  confers no property right.  218 S.C. at 229, 314 S.E.2d at 340.  The \r\n  Court also held that â€œ[b]ingo may only be conducted in accordance with the restrictions \r\n  imposed by the legislature.â€  Id.\r\nIn any case, the regulatory and revenue \r\n  provisions were enacted to further a legitimate governmental interest:  regulation \r\n  of bingo to prevent the proliferation of crime. \r\n  [12]   The Taxpayers bear a particularly onerous burden in attempting to \r\n  prove the tax statutes violate due process.  In Army Navy Bingo, this \r\n  Court recognized that the old bingo licensing scheme at issue was part of the \r\n  Stateâ€™s tax law.  Further, this Court found that â€œa tax does not violate the \r\n  Fourteenth Amendment due process clause when its enforcement may result in destroying \r\n  a particular business.â€  Army Navy Bingo, 281 S.C. at 229, 314 S.E.2d \r\n  at 340.  In light of this Courtâ€™s previous recognition of the legislatureâ€™s \r\n  power to regulate and tax bingo, and of the stateâ€™s legitimate interest in doing \r\n  so, it is clear that Taxpayers have not proven a violation of due process.   \r\n\r\nC. Free Speech\r\n The Taxpayers argue that the challenged \r\n  statutes violate their right to freedom of speech.  This argument is not preserved \r\n  for review by this Court.\r\n Taxpayers did not allege a violation \r\n  of free speech in their complaint.  After the 1996 action, the only causes of \r\n  action remaining were Taxpayersâ€™ equal protection and due process claims.  At \r\n  the hearing before the circuit court, Taxpayersâ€™ counsel stated, â€œso we are \r\n  here today basically on the re-filed complaint, when the action was restored \r\n  solely on the due process and equal protection claims.â€  Although counsel later \r\n  referred to some Supreme Court cases involving First Amendment challenges, it \r\n  never presented a direct argument that the statutes in question violated the \r\n  First Amendment.  The circuit court did not address a First Amendment challenge \r\n  in its order either.  \r\n Generally, claims or defenses not presented \r\n  in the pleadings will not be considered on appeal.  Toal, Vafai, and Muckenfuss, \r\n  Appellate Practice in South Carolina (2d Ed. 2002) (citing McNeely \r\n  v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 259 S.C. 39, 190 S.E.2d 499 \r\n  (1972)).  This rule is consistent with the concept that one cannot present one \r\n  theory at trial, lose, and then attack the decision below on another theory \r\n  not argued at trial.  Id.  Although some issues not raised in the pleadings \r\n  may become part of the case by implied consent of the parties, this is not such \r\n  a case.  Rule 15(b), SCRCP.  In order to be tried by implied consent, the issue \r\n  must have been discussed extensively at trial.  See Andrews v. Von Elten \r\n  &amp; Walker, Inc., 315 S.C. 199, 432 S.E.2d 500 (Ct. App. 1993).  As the \r\n  First Amendment challenge was not pleaded, discussed extensively at trial, or \r\n  ruled upon by the trial judge, it is not preserved for review. \r\nIII. Implied Exemption from Taxation\r\nTaxpayers argue Article XVII, Â§ 7 creates \r\n  an implied exemption from taxation for charities that conduct bingo.  We disagree.\r\n Once again, Taxpayersâ€™ argument is based \r\n  on the flawed reasoning that the constitutional amendment created a right to \r\n  play bingo comparable to the right of free speech or the freedom of religion.  \r\n  Taxpayers as charities are not inherently exempt from taxation; charities are \r\n  tax exempt only by operation of specific statutory or constitutional provisions.  \r\n  See 71 Am. Jur. 2d  362 (1972).  Although legislatures have historically \r\n  provided tax relief for charities, such tax relief has not become a constitutional \r\n  right.  Id.  \r\n Article XVII, Â§ 7 does not create an \r\n  express tax exemption for charities conducting bingo.  In order to prove such \r\n  charities are impliedly exempt, the implication must be â€œplain.â€ Ellerbe \r\n  v. David, 193 S.C. 332, 8 S.E.2d 518 (1940).  Statutory language alleged \r\n  to create â€œexemptions from taxation will not be strained or liberally \r\n  construed in favor of the taxpayer claiming the exemption.â€  York County \r\n  Fair Assoc. v. South Carolina Tax Comm., 249 S.C. 337, 341, 154 S.E.2d 361, \r\n  363 (1967) (emphasis added).  \r\n In our opinion, Taxpayersâ€™ argument that \r\n  an implied exemption arises out of the stateâ€™s historical tax treatment of charities \r\n  is insufficient to show an implied exemption.  Rather, their argument is a reflection \r\n  of the inflated stature Taxpayers have given to the constitutional amendmentâ€™s \r\n  exemption of bingo from the prohibition against lotteries.  As this Court commented, \r\n\r\n\r\n[t]he exemption for charitable bingo operators \r\n  in the general prohibition of gambling has been taken far beyond its intended \r\n  purpose of giving South Carolina charities a means of additional revenue.  Certainly, \r\n  the operation of bingo should not be the primary purpose for the existence of \r\n  the exempted groups in South Carolina.  \r\n\r\nArmy Navy Bingo, 281 S.C. at 230, 314 S.E.2d \r\n  at 341.\r\nIV.  Res Judicata\r\nThe Department argues that Taxpayersâ€™ \r\n  constitutional claims should have been brought simultaneously with their non-constitutional \r\n  claims in FOP I, and, as a result, are now barred by the doctrine of \r\n  res judicata.  We disagree.\r\n In Ward v. State, this Court held \r\n  that administrative law judges cannot rule on the constitutionality of a statute.  \r\n  343 S.C. 14, 538 S.E.2d 245 (2000).  According to Ward, in cases raising \r\n  solely constitutional issues, â€œa court may decide the case without waiting for \r\n  an administrative ruling.â€  Id. at 19, 538 S.E.2d at 247.  In Ward, \r\n  federal retirees brought a declaratory judgment to challenge the constitutionality \r\n  of a statute, and the Court held bringing a declaratory action in the circuit \r\n  court was the only appropriate remedy because the ALJ could not rule on the \r\n  constitutionality issue.\r\n Taxpayers raised all of the non-constitutional \r\n  issues from the 1993 original complaint in FOP I to the ALJD.  On appeal, \r\n  the circuit court judge claimed the constitutional issues could not be raised \r\n  because they were not ruled upon by the ALJ below.  Based on this Courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  in Ward, Taxpayers were not required to raise them to the ALJ in FOP \r\n  I, and were justified in raising their remaining constitutional issues in \r\n  a declaratory judgment action directly to the circuit court. \r\nConclusion\r\nThe success of Taxpayersâ€™ constitutional \r\n  challenges to the 1989 Act and to sections 12-21-3441 and 12-21-3610 depends \r\n  entirely on finding that the 1974 constitutional amendment to Article XVII, \r\n  Â§ 7 created a right to play bingo.  This Courtâ€™s opinion in Army Navy Bingo \r\n  answers this question in the negative.  We have found no reason why Army \r\n  Navy Bingo should be overruled.  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM \r\n  the circuit court on all issues and deny the Departmentâ€™s claim that Taxpayersâ€™ \r\n  case is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C. Code Â§ 12-21-3310 \r\n    et seq. (Supp. 1994).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The contested provisions \r\n    were repealed by the Bingo Tax Act of 1996, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-3910 (Supp. \r\n    1997).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  In FOP I, the Court addressed three issues:  (1) whether bingo \r\n    taxes collected pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-21-3440(B) and 12-21-3441 \r\n    (Supp. 1997) must be counted as gross proceeds, and consequently subject to \r\n    the sales and use taxes imposed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-3610 (Supp. 1997); \r\n    (2) whether gross proceeds includes monies bingo operators are statutorily \r\n    required to pay out as prize money under Â§ 12-21-3420(12) (Supp. 1997); and \r\n    (3) whether the operators are entitled to a refund on the sales taxes paid \r\n    on their retail purchases of bingo cards, which they then resold to the players.  \r\n    The Court reversed the trial court on the first issue, holding that the bingo \r\n    tax is not a component of gross proceeds, and accordingly is not subject to \r\n    the sales and use taxes.  The Court answered the remaining issues in the negative, \r\n    and affirmed the lower courtâ€™s denial of the Taxpayersâ€™ refund.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Rather than amending their \r\n    original complaint, which contained both causes of action that had already \r\n    been addressed in FOP I and listed plaintiffs that were no longer parties, \r\n    the Taxpayers and the Department stipulated that the first, second, and third \r\n    causes of action had been resolved. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]   Prior to 1975, the South Carolina Constitution contained a general \r\n    prohibition against lotteries, and did not exempt bingo from the prohibition \r\n    against lotteries.  S.C. Const. art. XIV, Â§ 2 (1868); S.C. Const. art. XVII, \r\n    Â§ 7 (1898).  Until the amendment to the Constitution in 1974 that exempted \r\n    bingo from the prohibition against lotteries, bingo was illegal in South Carolina.  \r\n    This section was amended again in 2001 to allow the State to conduct a lottery, \r\n    but the exemption allowing charitable organizations to conduct bingo was not \r\n    altered.  S.C. Const. art. XVII, Â§ 7 (Supp. 2001). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ \r\n    3; U.S. Const. amend.

Office of Appellate Defense, \r\n  of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Chief Capital and Collateral Litigation Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Deputy \r\n  Attorney General Allen Bullard, Jr., and Assistant Attorney General Douglas \r\n  E. Leadbitter, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n___________\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES: We ordered the parties to address \r\n  the issue whether the defense of laches is available to the State where, as \r\n  here, a post-conviction relief (PCR) applicant has made an Austin \r\n  [1]  claim.  We hold that while laches may be pled as an affirmative defense, \r\n  the State has waived it in this particular action.  This matter shall proceed \r\n  as directed below.\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 1992, petitionerâ€™s first PCR application was denied after \r\n  an evidentiary hearing.  Appellate review of that order was not sought.  Petitioner \r\n  subsequently filed a second PCR application alleging, among other things, an \r\n  Austin claim that his first PCR attorney had rendered ineffective assistance \r\n  of counsel in failing to seek review of the 1992 PCR order.  Following an evidentiary \r\n  hearing on this second PCR application, the circuit court judge found petitionerâ€™s \r\n  testimony credible that his first PCR attorney had failed to perfect certiorari \r\n  despite petitionerâ€™s timely request.  Accordingly, the second PCR judge concluded \r\n  that petitioner was entitled to belated appellate review of the 1992 PCR order.\r\nPetitioner timely sought certiorari to review this second \r\n  PCR order.  See King v. State, 308 S.C. 348, 417 S.E.2d 868 (1992) \r\n  (appellate procedure in Austin matter).  In the course of preparing the \r\n  appendix, petitionerâ€™s counsel learned that no transcript of the 1992 PCR hearing \r\n  was available, and petitioned the Court to remand the matter so that the record \r\n  from that hearing could be reconstructed.  See China v. Parrott, \r\n  251 S.C. 329, 162 S.E.2d 276 (1968) (trial judge reconstructed record where \r\n  court reporter records were unavailable).  The motion was denied, and the Court \r\n  instructed the parties to brief â€œwhether, in an instance such as this, a PCR \r\n  applicant may be barred from seeking Austin review by the doctrine of \r\n  laches.â€  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May laches bar an Austin review?\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May laches properly be raised by the State in this \r\n  matter?\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What procedure shall be followed where laches is \r\n  properly raised as a defense to an Austin claim?\r\n  4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How shall the parties in this case proceed?\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.     Laches\r\nWe have held that the PCR statute of limitations found in \r\n  S. C. Code Ann. Â§17-27-45(A) (Supp. 2001) does not apply to Austin claims.  \r\n  Odom v. State, 337 S.C. 256, 523 S.E.2d 753 (1999); see also Wilson \r\n  v. State, 348 S.C. 215, 559 S.E.2d 581 (2002) (reaffirming Odom).  \r\n  As both petitioner and the State recognize, the doctrine of laches may bar an \r\n  action such as this where there is no applicable statute of limitations.  E.g., \r\n  Godwin v. Carrigan, 227 S.C. 216, 87 S.E.2d 471 (1955).\r\nLaches is an equitable doctrine, which â€œarises upon the \r\n  failure to assert a known right.â€  Ex parte Stokes, 256 S.C. 260, 182 \r\n  S.E.2d 306 (1971).  Laches is defined as:\r\n\r\nNeglect for an unreasonable and \r\n  unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, \r\n  to do what in law should have been done.  Whether a claim is barred by laches \r\n  is to be determined in light of the facts of each case, taking into consideration \r\n  whether the delay has worked injury, prejudice, or disadvantage to the other \r\n  party; delay alone in assertion of a right does not constitute laches.\r\n  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 198-199, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527\r\n  (1988).\r\nWe hold that laches may be raised as a defense to \r\n  an Austin PCR.\r\n\r\nB.     Applicability in this case\r\nLaches is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded.  \r\n  Rule 8(c), SCRCP.  The failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a waiver \r\n  of the right to assert it.  E.g., Adams v. B&amp;D, Inc., 297 \r\n  S.C. 416, 377 S.E.2d 315 (1989).\r\nThe State neither raised laches in its return to petitionerâ€™s \r\n  second PCR application nor in its motion to dismiss that application.  The State \r\n  has waived its right to raise the affirmative defense of laches in this case.  \r\n  Adams v. B&amp;D, Inc., supra.\r\nC.      Procedure where laches is raised\r\nIn cases where laches is properly raised as a defense to \r\n  an Austin claim, the PCR court shall hear evidence on this defense at \r\n  the same time it hears the applicantâ€™s Austin claim on the merits.  In \r\n  all such cases, the PCR judge shall make a specific finding on the laches issue \r\n  as well as a specific finding on the Austin claim.  Depending on the \r\n  nature of these rulings, the following procedures shall be followed if appellate \r\n  review is sought:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; If the PCR judge finds for the applicant on both the Austin \r\n  claim and the laches defense:\r\n  \r\na) the applicant shall proceed according to the procedure outlined in King \r\n  v. State, supra;\r\nb) the State may cross-petition for review of the laches ruling;\r\n  \r\n  (2)&nbsp; If the PCR judge finds for the State on both the laches defense \r\n  and the Austin claim:\r\n  \r\n  a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner shall file a petition for certiorari addressing \r\n  both rulings on their merits, and shall include a list of the issues that would \r\n  be raised were an Austin review granted;\r\n  \r\n  (3)&nbsp; If the PCR judge finds for the State on the laches defense \r\n  and for petitioner on the Austin claim:\r\n  \r\n  a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner shall raise the laches issue on the merits \r\n  in his petition for writ of certiorari, in addition to following the procedure \r\n  outlined in King v. State, supra; and\r\n  \r\n  (4)&nbsp; If the PCR judge finds for petitioner on the laches defense \r\n  and for the State on the Austin claim;\r\n  \r\n  a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner shall follow the King v. State procedure;\r\nb) the State may cross-petition for review of the laches ruling.\r\n  \r\n\r\nD.     Procedure in this case\r\nPetitioner sought a remand to reconstruct the record of \r\n  his first PCR hearing.  See China v. Parrott, supra.  We \r\n  now grant his motion and remand the case to Jasper County for a hearing to reconstruct \r\n  the first PCR record.  This hearing should be held within 45 days of the date \r\n  this opinion is filed.  If the circuit court judge determines that reconstruction \r\n  is not possible, he shall notify this Court and the parties within 15 days of \r\n  the reconstruction hearing.  If the record is reconstructed, the parties shall \r\n  notify this Court and the matter will proceed according to King v. State, \r\n  supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis matter \r\n  is remanded to the circuit court with instructions to hold a reconstruction \r\n  hearing promptly.\r\n REMANDED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Austin v.

DSS alleged the minor was, among other claims, sexually abused \r\n  by her father Respondent Scott Wilson (Wilson) and sought 1) an intervention \r\n  hearing by the family court, 2) inclusion of Wilsonâ€™s name in the Central Registry \r\n  of Child Abuse and Neglect pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-650(K) \r\n  (Supp. 2001), 3) approval of a treatment plan, and 4) any other relief deemed \r\n  necessary and proper. \r\nAt the beginning of the intervention hearing, counsel for DSS moved to allow \r\n  the seventeen-year-old minor to testify outside the presence of her father.  \r\n  Counsel for DSS stated the minor did not want to testify in her fatherâ€™s presence \r\n  because the allegations involved sexual abuse.  Over Wilsonâ€™s objection, the \r\n  family court granted DSSâ€™ motion. \r\nWhile the minor testified in the courtroom, Wilson was sequestered \r\n  in a conference room.  Although he could hear his daughter, Wilson and the minor \r\n  could not see each other.  Wilsonâ€™s attorney remained in the courtroom.  Wilson \r\n  consulted with his attorney during a two minute break after the minorâ€™s direct \r\n  examination.  Cross-examination followed, again outside Wilsonâ€™s presence.\r\nUltimately, the family court issued an order finding â€œDSS has met their burden \r\n  of proof for threat of harm for sexual abuse perpetrated by [Wilson].â€  It concluded \r\n  Wilson â€œabused or neglectedâ€ the minor as defined in South Carolina Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-490 (Supp. 2001) [1]  and ordered his name \r\n  be entered in the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect.  Additionally, \r\n  the family court ordered the minorâ€™s custody remain with her mother, noted Wilson \r\n  had agreed to forego visitation, and ordered counseling for Wilson and his daughter. \r\n  [2]     \r\nWilson appealed.  The Court of Appeals held â€œthe family courtâ€™s decision to \r\n  allow [the minor] to testify outside [Wilsonâ€™s] presence violated due process \r\n  because it denied him the right of confrontation.â€  Id. S.C. at 244, \r\n  S.E.2d at 393.  The Court granted DSSâ€™ petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n ISSUES\r\n\r\nI.  Did the Court of Appeals err by determining Wilson has an \r\n  interest which is protected by due process?    \r\nII.  Did the Court of Appeals err by adopting the procedures \r\n  set forth in State v. Murrell, 302 S.C. 77, 393 S.E.2d 919 (1990), for \r\n  use in intervention proceedings?  \r\nIII.   Did the Court of Appeals fail to consider the effect \r\n  of its decision on Family Court Rule 22 and South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-180 \r\n  (Supp. 2001)?  \r\nIV.  Did the Court of Appeals err by holding the minorâ€™s testimony \r\n  outside Wilsonâ€™s presence was insufficient to comport with due process?   \r\n\r\n\r\n ANALYSIS\r\nINTERVENTION \r\n  PROCEEDINGS\r\nThe General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive scheme to administer child \r\n  welfare services.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-480 et seq. (Supp. 2001).  The \r\n  stated purpose of the intake provision is to, among other goals, â€œestablish \r\n  an effective system of services throughout the State to safeguard the well-being \r\n  and development of endangered children and to preserve and stabilize family \r\n  life, whenever appropriateâ€ and â€œestablish fair and equitable procedures, compatible \r\n  with due process of law to intervene in family life with due regard to the safety \r\n  and welfare of all family members.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-480(B)(2) and (4) \r\n  (Supp. 2001). \r\nDSS has the statutory duty to investigate all reports of suspected child abuse \r\n  and neglect.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-650.  After investigation, DSS â€œmay petition \r\n  the family court for authority to intervene and provide protective services \r\n  without removal of custody if the department determines by a preponderance of \r\n  the evidence that the child is an abused or neglected child and that the child \r\n  cannot be protected from harm without intervention.â€ \r\n  [3]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-738(A).   \r\nAfter the hearing, the family court may order intervention and\r\nprotective services if it finds the allegations of the petition are supported \r\n  by a preponderance of the evidence, including a finding that the child is an \r\n  abused or neglected child as defined in Section 20-7-490 and the child cannot \r\n  be protected from further harm without intervention.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-738(D).  \r\n  If the family court finds there is a preponderance of evidence the defendant \r\n  physically or sexually abused or willfully or recklessly neglected the child, \r\n  it must order the person be entered in the Central Registry of Child Abuse and \r\n  Neglect.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-650(K)(1). \r\n  [4]   The statutory proceeding is â€œa civil action aimed at protection \r\n  of a child, not a criminal action geared toward punishing a defendant.â€  Beaufort \r\n  County Depâ€™t of Social Serv. v. Strahan, 310 S.C. 553, 554, 426 S.E.2d 331, \r\n  332 (Ct. App. 1992).           \r\nDUE PROCESS\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, â€œnor shall \r\n  any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process \r\n  of law. . .â€.    â€œ[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections \r\n  as the particular situation demands.â€  Morrisey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, \r\n  481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, 494 (1972). The requirements in a \r\n  particular case are dependent upon the importance of the interest involved and \r\n  the circumstances under which the deprivation may occur.  South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Social Serv. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 481 S.E.2d 703 (1997); Mathews \r\n  v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33 (1976) \r\n  (in determining the process which is due, court will consider the private interest \r\n  affected by the proceeding, the risk of error created by the chosen procedure, \r\n  and the countervailing governmental interest supporting challenged procedure).  \r\n  The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at \r\n  a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social \r\n  Serv. v. Beeks, supra. \r\nâ€œWhere important decisions turn on questions of fact, due \r\n  process often requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse \r\n  witnesses.â€  Brown v. South Carolina State Bd. of Educ., 301 S.C. 326, \r\n  329, 391 S.E.2d 866, 867 (1990) citing Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 \r\n  U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.E.2d 287 (1970); see South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Social Serv. v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 459 S.E.2d 846 (1995) (right \r\n  to confrontation applies in civil context).  Confrontation includes the right \r\n  to be physically present during the presentation of testimony.  See State \r\n  v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001).  Due process is not violated \r\n  where a party is not given the opportunity to confront witnesses so long as \r\n  there has been a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Social Serv. v. Holden, supra.\r\nI.\r\nDSS claims the Court of Appeals erred by determining Wilson \r\n  had an interest which was protected by due process because the intervention \r\n  proceeding did not affect his life, liberty, or property.  We disagree.     \r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment guarantees Wilson a fundamental \r\n  right to freedom from State interference with his relationship with his daughter.  \r\n  See  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394, \r\n  71 L.Ed.2d 599, 606 (1982) (â€œ[F]reedom of personal choice in matters of family \r\n  life is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.â€); \r\n  Greenville County Depâ€™t of Social Serv. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 194, \r\n  437 S.E.2d 107, 111 (1993), quoting Santosky v. Kramer, supra \r\n  455 U.S. at 753, 102 S.Ct. at 1394-95, 71 L.Ed.2d at 606 (â€œThe fundamental liberty \r\n  interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child \r\n  does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents . . . .â€).  \r\n  Although DSSâ€™ action neither sought to terminate Wilsonâ€™s parental rights nor \r\n  remove the minor from Wilsonâ€™s home, both situations which clearly interfere \r\n  with a fundamental liberty interest and invoke due process protections, \r\n  [5]  by initiating this action DSS nonetheless â€œintervenedâ€ in Wilsonâ€™s \r\n  relationship with his daughter.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals did not err \r\n  in finding Wilson has a fundamental liberty interest in his familial relationship \r\n  which entitles him to some level of due process in an intervention action.  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nDSS asserts the Court of Appeals erred by adopting the procedures \r\n  set forth in State v. Murrell, supra, to determine whether the \r\n  child witness may testify outside the presence of her parent/defendant.  \r\nIn State v. \r\n  Murrell, supra, the Court established the circumstances under which \r\n  and procedures by which a child witness may testify outside the presence of \r\n  the defendant in a criminal trial via videotaped testimony:\r\n\r\nFirst, the trial judge must make a case-specific determination \r\n  of the need for videotaped testimony.  In making this determination, the trial \r\n  court should consider the testimony of an expert witness, parents or other relatives, \r\n  other concerned and relevant parties, and the child.  Second, the court should \r\n  place the child in as close to a courtroom setting as possible.  Third, the \r\n  defendant should be able to see and hear the child, should have counsel present \r\n  both in the courtroom and with him, and communication should be available between \r\n  counsel and appellant.\r\n\r\nId. 302 S.C. at 80-81, 393 S.E.2d at 921.\r\nMore recently, our Court \r\n  stated:\r\n\r\nThe trial court \r\n  must also find that the child witness would be traumatized, not by the courtroom \r\n  generally, but by the presence of the defendant . . . . Denial of face-to-face \r\n  confrontation is not needed to further state interest in protecting the child \r\n  witness from trauma unless it is the presence of the defendant that causes the \r\n  trauma.\r\n\r\nState v. Bray, \r\n  342 S.C. 23, 30, 535 S.E.2d 636, 640 (2000) quoting Maryland v. Craig, \r\n  497 U.S. 836, 856-7, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3169-70, 111 L.Ed.2d 666, 685 (1990).\r\nIn State v. Bray, id., the Court \r\n  indicated its unwillingness to adopt any categorical prerequisites in order \r\n  for a child witness to testify outside the defendantâ€™s presence.  The Court \r\n  nonetheless emphasized the trial judge must make case-specific reasons for use \r\n  of a procedure which excludes the defendant from being present during the child \r\n  victimâ€™s testimony. \r\nLike criminal matters, an important liberty \r\n  interest is also at issue in an intervention proceeding.  Accordingly, in an \r\n  intervention proceeding, the child witnessâ€™ testimony should be given in the \r\n  presence of the parent/defendant.  However, the Court recognizes that in some \r\n  circumstances it is necessary to protect sensitive witnesses, especially minors, \r\n  from the trauma of testifying.  See  State v. Cooper, 291 S.C. \r\n  351, 353 S.E.2d 451 (1987) (while it is preferable for child accuser to testify \r\n  in criminal trial, face-to-face requirement of confrontation may be served by \r\n  appearance before counsel for cross-examination outside defendantâ€™s presence). [6]   \r\n Consequently, we conclude that while the procedures established in State \r\n  v. Murrell, supra, are applicable in criminal matters, not intervention \r\n  hearings, they do provide useful guidance.  Accordingly, we adopt a procedure \r\n  by which the family court may permit a child witness to testify outside the \r\n  presence of the parent/defendant.  The family court must first determine the \r\n  child would be traumatized by testifying in the presence of her parent/defendant \r\n  and, therefore, it is necessary for the child to testify outside the presence \r\n  of the parent/defendant.  In determining whether need for this accommodation \r\n  exists, the family court may consider the childâ€™s age, mentality, and any other \r\n  pertinent information.  In making its decision, the family court should consider \r\n  the testimony of the child and/or other relevant witnesses.  We emphasize the \r\n  family court must make case-specific findings of need for the special accommodation \r\n  and it must place those particularized findings on the record.\r\n Second, if the family court determines the child witness may testify outside \r\n  the parent/defendantâ€™s presence, the testimony should be given in an environment \r\n  which indicates the seriousness of the matter.  Arrangements should be made \r\n  for the parent/defendant to hear the child while she testifies.  The parent/defendant \r\n  should have reasonable opportunities to confer with counsel during the childâ€™s \r\n  testimony and the parent/defendantâ€™s counsel should have the opportunity to \r\n  cross-examine the child witness.  \r\nWe conclude this \r\n  simple balancing procedure adequately protects the child witness from unnecessary \r\n  trauma while fairly protecting the parent/defendantâ€™s constitutional right to \r\n  due process, including the right to confrontation.\r\nIII.\r\nDSS asserts that requiring the family court to determine \r\n  whether a child witness may be permitted to testify outside the presence of \r\n  the parent/defendant will interfere with Family Court Rule 22 and South Carolina \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-180 (Supp. 2001).  We disagree.  \r\nRule 22, SCRFC, \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nIn all matters relating to children, \r\n  the family court judge shall have the right, within his discretion, to talk \r\n  with children, individually or together, in private conference.  Upon timely \r\n  request, the court, in its discretion, may permit a guardian ad litem for a \r\n  child who is being examined, and/or the attorneys representing the parents, \r\n  if any, to be present during the interview.  \r\n\r\nRule 22, SCRFC, provides the family court judge with discretion \r\n  to speak with the child in private conference.  The parent/defendantâ€™s due process \r\n  right to be present when a child testifies does not interfere with the \r\n  application of Rule 22, SCRFC.  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-180 (Supp. 2001) provides \r\n  for the admission of out-of-court statements made by a child who is less than \r\n  twelve years old or who functions cognitively, adaptively, or developmentally \r\n  under the age of twelve at the time of the family court abuse and/or neglect \r\n  proceeding. [7]   Pursuant \r\n  to the statute, \r\n\r\n(B) An out-of-court statement [attributed to the child] may \r\n  be admitted if . . .   \r\n  \r\n1) the child \r\n  testifies at the proceeding or testifies by means of video deposition or closed-circuit \r\n  television, and at the time of the testimony the child is subject to cross-examination \r\n  about the statement; or\r\n(2)&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n (a) the child \r\n  is found by the court to be unavailable to testify on any of these \r\n  grounds:\r\n      \r\n(i)&nbsp; the childâ€™s death;\r\n(ii) the childâ€™s physical or mental disability;\r\n(iii) the existence of a privilege involving \r\n  the child;\r\n(iv) the childâ€™s \r\n  incompetency, including the childâ€™s inability to communicate about the offense \r\n  because of fear;\r\n(v) substantial likelihood that the child would suffer severe \r\n  emotional trauma from testifying at the proceeding or by means of videotaped \r\n  deposition or closed-circuit television [8] ; and\r\n      \r\n (b)the childâ€™s out-of-court \r\n  statement is shown to possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSection 19-1-180 (B)(1) does not authorize the exclusion \r\n  of the parent/defendant at the video deposition, closed circuit television taping, \r\n  or the proceeding at which the child testifies.  In fact, because the statute \r\n  specifically provides for cross-examination at the time the child testifies, \r\n  it contemplates the presence of the parent/defendant.  See Depâ€™t of \r\n  Social Serv. v. Wheaton, 323 S.C. 299, 474 S.E.2d 156 (Ct. App. 1995) (Section \r\n  19-1-180 provides hearsay statement is admissible if child testifies and submits \r\n  to cross-examination).  Should DSS believe there is a compelling need for the \r\n  child to testify outside the presence of her parent/defendant, it should file \r\n  a motion requesting the family courtâ€™s permission to obtain the childâ€™s testimony \r\n  outside the parent/defendantâ€™s presence. \r\nFurthermore, Section 19-1-180 (B)(2) is not affected by our \r\n  holding in this matter.  Section 19-1-180 (B)(2) allows the family court to \r\n  admit a childâ€™s out-of-court statement after deeming the child â€œunavailableâ€ \r\n  to testify for one of five statutory grounds and determining the statement possesses \r\n  particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.  If the family court makes these \r\n  determinations, the child does not testify.  Our decision in this case applies \r\n  when a child testifies.   \r\nIV.\r\nDSS contends, even though the minor did not testify in the \r\n  presence of her father, Wilsonâ€™s due process rights were nonetheless protected \r\n  by his ability to hear the minorâ€™s testimony, his counselâ€™s presence during \r\n  her testimony, his right to cross-examination, and Wilsonâ€™s ability to confer \r\n  with counsel before cross-examination.  We disagree.    \r\nAs discussed above, if the child testifies \r\n  at an intervention proceeding, the due process right to confrontation requires \r\n  the child testify in the presence of her parent/defendant unless special circumstances \r\n  are established.  Wilsonâ€™s ability to hear the minorâ€™s testimony, discuss her \r\n  testimony with counsel, and cross-examine her were insufficient to satisfy due \r\n  process without the determination the minor would be traumatized by testifying \r\n  in her fatherâ€™s presence.  As conceded by DSS at oral argument, the minor was \r\n  the key witness against Wilson and she may have been less credible if she had \r\n  testified in his presence.  Because Wilson did not have the opportunity to be \r\n  heard in a meaningful manner, his due process right was violated.  Cf. \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Serv. v. Holden, supra (where father \r\n  obtained six month continuance to depose mother but failed to do so, his due \r\n  process right was not violated through admission of motherâ€™s affidavit rather \r\n  than live testimony in child enforcement proceeding).  \r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is AFFIRMED \r\n  AS MODIFIED. \r\nMOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nChief Justice Toal:  I respectfully dissent.  \r\n  In my opinion, Wilsonâ€™s objection to DSSâ€™ motion did not preserve the argument \r\n  he raises on appeal concerning application of the procedures established in \r\n  State v. Murrell, 302 S.C. 77, 393 S.E.2d 919 (1990), to intervention \r\n  proceedings in family court.  Regardless, I believe the examination of Wilsonâ€™s \r\n  daughter comported with due process, as she remained in the courtroom setting, \r\n  Wilson was able to hear the direct and cross-examination of his daughter by \r\n  live video monitor, and was able to confer with his counsel before cross-examination.  \r\n  See Murrell, 302 S.C. at 82, 393 S.E.2d at 922.\r\nAs discussed by the majority, in State \r\n  v. Murrell, this Court established procedures by which a child witness could \r\n  testify outside the presence of the defendant in a criminal trial. \r\n   Until the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in this case, these procedures \r\n  have been limited to criminal trials.  Although I have no problem with \r\n  extending the use of these procedures to family court proceedings prospectively, \r\n  I object to the mandatory, retroactive application of the procedure to this \r\n  case, in which the family courtâ€™s failure to make an individualized determination \r\n  of need was, at most, harmless error.   \r\nWilson has made no showing that he was prejudiced \r\n  by having his daughter testify outside of his presence, or that DSS could not \r\n  show the requisite need for his daughter to testify outside of his presence.  \r\n  The family court ensured Wilsonâ€™s due process rights were protected:  Wilsonâ€™s \r\n  daughter testified in the courtroom, Wilson was able to hear his daughter testify \r\n  on direct and cross, and was able to confer with his attorney prior to cross-examination \r\n  of his daughter.  Therefore, I believe his due process rights were not harmed \r\n  by the courtâ€™s failure to make an individualized determination of need in this \r\n  case, and would REVERSE the decision of the Court of Appeals on that \r\n  basis.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The statute \r\n    defines â€œabused or neglected childâ€ as a child who has been harmed or is threatened \r\n    with harm.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490(2).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] The minor was \r\n    five years old when her parents divorced.  She lived with Wilson since the \r\n    divorce until four months before the family court hearing.  By consent, permanent \r\n    custody was awarded to the minorâ€™s mother before the intervention hearing.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Other \r\n    options, including removal of the child from parental custody, are available.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n    20-7-736.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] A personâ€™s \r\n    name remains on the registry for seven years.  Information contained in the \r\n    Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect is confidential. However, a lengthy \r\n    list of exceptions authorizes certain persons access to the information.  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-690(A).  For example, law enforcement agencies and solicitors \r\n    investigating suspected child abuse may obtain information contained on the \r\n    registry.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-690(B)(4) and (19).  In addition, the â€œperpetratorâ€ \r\n    may be disclosed â€œwhen screening of an individualâ€™s background is required \r\n    by statute or regulation for employment, licensing, or any other purposes. \r\n    . .â€.

(BNP) sued petitioner 42 Magnolia Partnership \r\n  (the Partnership) and Robert Mundy [1]  for breach of contract, breach of contract \r\n  accompanied by fraudulent act, and fraud.  At the end of trial, the trial court \r\n  submitted to the jury the fraud claim against both the Partnership and Mundy \r\n  and the breach of contract claim against the Partnership.  The jury returned \r\n  a verdict in favor of the Partnership and Mundy on the fraud action, but found \r\n  in favor of BNP on the breach of contract claim.  The jury awarded BNP $100,000 \r\n  in damages.  The trial court denied the Partnershipâ€™s motion for a judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), and the Partnership appealed.  The Court \r\n  of Appeals affirmed, holding:  (1) there was overwhelming evidence of breach \r\n  of contract; and (2) damages for the breach could be recovered despite BNPâ€™s \r\n  cancellation of the contract.  Boddie-Noell, supra.\r\nFACTS \r\n  [2]\r\nThe Partnership developed \r\n  an apartment complex called 42 Magnolia in Columbia, South Carolina.  In February \r\n  1994, the Partnership borrowed $6.9 million from the Lincoln National Life Insurance \r\n  Company (Lincoln) to finance the complex.  In June 1994, Southport Financial \r\n  Asset Management, Inc. (Southport) and the Partnership entered into a purchase \r\n  and sale agreement where Southport agreed to buy the complex for $10.5 million.  \r\n  Mundy negotiated the purchase agreement for the Partnership, and John Parker \r\n  represented Southport.  As part of the purchase agreement, Southport was to \r\n  assume the $6.9 million mortgage held by Lincoln; the closing date could not \r\n  be later than September 30, 1994.\r\nIn September 1994, BNP \r\n  entered into a contract with Southport and the Partnership called the â€œFirst \r\n  Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement.â€  This contract recognized that Southport \r\n  assigned its rights under the purchase agreement to BNP and extended the closing \r\n  date to October 31, 1994. [3]   The contract provided that BNP would pay $100,000 \r\n  as an extension deposit within three days after the contract was executed.  \r\n  The contract further provided that BNP could, at any time prior to 5 p.m. on \r\n  September 30, â€œdemand and receive a complete refund of the Extension Deposit \r\n  uponâ€ BNPâ€™s failure to receive, inter alia, a loan assumption agreement \r\n  from Lincoln.  In the event that BNP exercised this provision, the contract \r\n  would become â€œnull and void;â€ the purchase agreement, however, between Southport \r\n  and the Partnership would remain â€œin full force and effect.â€\r\nScott Wilkerson, BNPâ€™s president, \r\n  explained that BNP would not have been interested in the property without the \r\n  Lincoln loan because it had such a low interest rate.  Therefore, the loan assumption \r\n  was a crucial part of the transaction.  Wilkerson testified that he was told \r\n  specifically not to contact Lincoln but to go through Mundy.  Parker likewise \r\n  testified that Mundy â€œhad become the mouthpiece of Lincoln.â€  As a result, BNP \r\n  and Southport were relying on Mundy to give Lincoln the information necessary \r\n  to get Lincolnâ€™s approval of the loan assumption.\r\nThus, all the information required by Lincoln regarding \r\n  the loan assumption flowed from the buyer (which initially was Southport and \r\n  then was BNP), to Mundy, then to Fleet Funding (Lincolnâ€™s local servicing agent), \r\n  and, finally, to Lincoln.  Parker testified that after Southport assigned its \r\n  rights to BNP, Mundy inquired about the â€œsecret profitâ€ Southport was going \r\n  to make.  When Parker refused to tell him, Mundyâ€™s behavior became â€œfishyâ€ according \r\n  to Parker.  Nonetheless, with the September 30 deadline approaching, the parties \r\n  continued to work on obtaining Lincolnâ€™s consent to BNPâ€™s assumption of the \r\n  loan.\r\nAlthough the loan was generally a non-recourse loan, \r\n  there were certain exceptions or â€œcarve-outsâ€ which were personally guaranteed.  \r\n  For example, Lincoln required individuals to guarantee the loan for environmental \r\n  liability.  Mundy told BNP that Lincoln would not agree to an assumption of \r\n  the loan without personal guarantors for the environmental carve-outs.  However, \r\n  because BNP is a publicly traded corporation, Wilkerson told Mundy a personal \r\n  guaranty was not possible.  BNP offered to have the company sign for the carve-outs \r\n  or to provide Lincoln with a copy of its bond in lieu of individual guarantors.  \r\n  Wilkerson related this information to Mundy and was told that Lincoln was being \r\n  contacted daily.  According to Mundy, however, Lincoln insisted on individual \r\n  signers for the carve-outs.\r\nThe deadline of September 30 came and, because Mundy \r\n  said Lincoln would not approve the loan assumption, BNP reluctantly exercised \r\n  its option under the contract to cancel.  Wilkerson explained he did not want \r\n  to put $200,000 of his companyâ€™s money at risk without Lincolnâ€™s assurance it \r\n  would consent to the loan assumption.\r\nNevertheless, negotiations \r\n  regarding the sale of the property continued.  Wilkerson could not understand \r\n  why Lincoln was reluctant to approve assumption of the loan since it had closed \r\n  many other insurance company loans with only the company as a guarantor.  After \r\n  hearing that the Partnership had a meeting on October 5 and had discussed finding \r\n  another buyer at a higher price, Wilkerson decided to contact Lincoln directly.  \r\n  On October 6, he spoke with Calvin King of Lincoln and told him that the company \r\n  would sign for the carve-outs.  According to Wilkerson, King acted like he had \r\n  never heard this information before.  The very next day, Lincoln approved BNPâ€™s \r\n  assumption of the loan without any individual guarantors.  \r\nOn October 24, the Partnershipâ€™s attorney wrote BNP \r\n  and Southport a letter stating that BNP had terminated the contract and because \r\n  Southport did not close by September 30, pursuant to the original purchase agreement, \r\n  the Partnership was entitled to keep Southportâ€™s $100,000 deposit.  Negotiations \r\n  apparently continued for a few more months, but neither BNP nor Southport ever \r\n  purchased 42 Magnolia. \r\nThe jury found in \r\n  favor of BNP on the breach of contract claim and awarded $100,000 in damages.  \r\n  In its JNOV motion, the Partnership argued that because the contract was rescinded, \r\n  damages could not be recovered for any breach.  The trial court denied the motion, \r\n  and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Boddie-Noell, supra.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Where BNP exercised its option \r\n    to cancel under the contract, can BNP recover breach of contract damages?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Partnership argues that \r\n  because BNP â€œrescindedâ€ the contract, the contract was rendered â€œnull and void;â€ \r\n  therefore, BNP is barred from recovering damages for breach.  BNP responds that \r\n  the contract was not â€œrescinded,â€ but instead was â€œcanceledâ€ pursuant to the \r\n  contract terms.\r\nAddressing \r\n  the Partnershipâ€™s argument that BNP had rescinded the contract, the Court of \r\n  Appeals analyzed the issue as one of rescission and stated, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Rescission is an abrogation or \r\n    undoing of [a contract] from the beginning, which seeks to create a situation \r\n    the same as if no contract ever had existed. â€¦\r\nWhen a party elects and is granted \r\n  rescission as a remedy, he is entitled to be returned to status quo ante.  Rescission \r\n  entitles the party to a return of the consideration paid as well as any additional \r\n  sums necessary to restore him to the position occupied prior to the making of \r\n  the contract. â€¦\r\n\r\nBoddie-Noell, \r\n  344 S.C. at 482-83, 544 S.E.2d at 283-84 (internal quotes and citations omitted).\r\nThe Court of Appeals recognized, however, that in the instant \r\n  case, â€œno issue is presented in regard to rescission being granted by the court \r\n  as a remedy.  Rather, this record encapsulates a factual scenario involving \r\n  rescission exercised by a party when faced with a mandatory deadline.  \r\n  The breach of contract and resulting damages occurred before the rescission \r\n  by BNP.â€  Id. at 483, 544 S.E.2d at 284 (emphasis added).  Therefore, \r\n  the Court of Appeals looked to 17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 603 (1991), \r\n  which states that:\r\n\r\n[W]hen a contract contains a provision or option giving \r\n  the right â€¦ of cancellation and the contract is canceled in pursuance of the \r\n  right â€¦ given, such cancellation does not extinguish liabilities that have already \r\n  accrued under the contract, and this is so regardless of whether the liability \r\n  is that of the party who exercised the option to cancel the agreement or is \r\n  the liability of the party against whom the cancellation is made.\r\n\r\n(Footnotes omitted).  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals \r\n  held â€œBNPâ€™s rescission did not bar BNP from seeking damages for breach \r\n  of contract.â€ Boddie-Noell, 344 S.C. at 483-84, 544 S.E.2d at 284 (emphasis \r\n  added).  Furthermore, in the opinionâ€™s conclusion section, the Court of Appeals \r\n  stated:  â€œWe find a voluntary cancellation of a contract under a rescission \r\n  provision on account of a breach by the other party does not automatically release \r\n  each party from all obligations under the contract.â€  Id. at 486, 544 \r\n  S.E.2d at 285.\r\nThe Partnership contends that because \r\n  there was a rescission of the contract - pursuant to the contractâ€™s own terms \r\n  - the contract has become null and void.  This, according to the Partnership, \r\n  precludes BNP from suing for damages.  We disagree.\r\nIn our opinion, what \r\n  happened in this case has been mistakenly characterized as a rescission of the \r\n  contract. [4]   As a result, confusion has ensued about whether \r\n  BNP was entitled to sue for breach of contract damages.  While the Court of \r\n  Appeals discussed general law on â€œrescission,â€ it nonetheless correctly recognized \r\n  that the contract was â€œcancelledâ€ by exercising a provision within the contract \r\n  itself.  Thus, the Court of Appealsâ€™ ultimate reliance on the general rule enunciated \r\n  in 17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 603 was, in our opinion, appropriate.  This \r\n  particular section applies â€œwhen a contract contains a provision or option giving \r\n  the right or privilege of cancellationâ€ which is precisely the situation in \r\n  this case. \r\nAccordingly, we affirm \r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that BNP could recover for breach of contract \r\n  despite the fact it exercised its option to cancel under the contract.  See \r\n  17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 603 (â€œsuch cancellation does not extinguish \r\n  liabilities that have already accrued under the contract, and this is so \r\n  regardless of whether the liability is that of the party who exercised the option \r\n  to cancel the agreement or is the liability of the party against whom the cancellation \r\n  is madeâ€) (emphasis added); see also 17B C.J.S. Contracts \r\n  Â§ 448 (1999) (â€œthe exercise of a reserved power of termination will usually \r\n  have prospective operation only, and it will discharge both parties from their \r\n  contractual duty to perform promises that are still wholly executory, but \r\n  will not discharge the duty to make reparation for breaches that have already \r\n  occurred.â€) (emphasis added); 13 Corbin on Contracts, Â§ 1266 (Interim ed. \r\n  2002) (same).  We note there is no unfairness in applying this general rule \r\n  because it allows recovery for breach of contract after an option to cancel \r\n  is exercised irrespective of who the breaching party is.  Id.\r\nFurthermore, to hold otherwise would actually reward \r\n  the Partnership for Mundyâ€™s bad behavior, i.e. the breach itself.  As found \r\n  by the Court of Appeals, BNP presented â€œoverwhelming evidenceâ€ that, by withholding \r\n  information from Lincoln, Mundy breached the express provisions of the purchase \r\n  agreement as well as the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  See \r\n  Boddie-Noell, 344 S.C. at 484-85, 544 S.E.2d at 284-85.  Indeed, we concur \r\n  with BNPâ€™s argument that this case presents a somewhat unusual situation because \r\n  BNP was essentially tricked into canceling the contract and that it exercised \r\n  its right to cancel before it had knowledge of any breach.  Under these \r\n  peculiar circumstances, to deny BNP a remedy for the Partnershipâ€™s breach clearly \r\n  would be inequitable.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause BNP cancelled the contract pursuant to an express \r\n  right of cancellation within the contract, the Court of Appealsâ€™ focus on the \r\n  law of rescission was misplaced.  We affirm, however, the holding that BNPâ€™s \r\n  cancellation did not bar it from recovering damages for the breach that had \r\n  already occurred.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice\r\nGeorge T.

Walker, Jr., of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  \r\nIn this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel (ODC) have entered into an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, Rules for \r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension for a period of up to \r\n  two years, retroactive to October 17, 2000. [1]   We accept the agreement \r\n  and suspend respondent for eight months, retroactive to October 17, 2000.  The \r\n  following facts are set forth in the agreement.\r\nFacts\r\nIn August 2000, respondent was retained to represent \r\n  the client, the seller, in a real estate closing.  The buyerâ€™s loan amount of \r\n  approximately $50,000 was entrusted to respondent, and respondent deposited \r\n  the check into his trust account.  After the closing, respondent issued a check \r\n  to the client from his trust account in the amount of $49,547.04.  The client \r\n  deposited the check into his personal account.  The trust account check was \r\n  presented and returned twice for insufficient funds.  Respondent failed to promptly \r\n  respond to the clientâ€™s inquiries into this matter.  Subsequently, respondent \r\n  negotiated a bank loan, from which a bank check for the sale proceeds was issued \r\n  to the client.  \r\nIn connection with ODCâ€™s full investigation of this \r\n  matter, respondent acknowledged that he had not maintained proper control over \r\n  his trust account and did not maintain the trust account in accordance with \r\n  the requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.  Respondent advised ODC that a member of \r\n  his law office staff had misappropriated approximately $37,000 from the trust \r\n  account and that this individual had been arrested.\r\nRespondent commissioned an audit of his trust account.  \r\n  The audit revealed that, in a separate real estate matter in December 1999 in \r\n  which respondent served as the closing attorney, an overpayment in the amount \r\n  of $63,794.26 was made to the seller.  Respondent advised ODC that he is attempting \r\n  to contact this individual to arrange reimbursement for the overpayment.\r\nThe audit also uncovered errors in transactions where \r\n  respondent made disbursements from the trust account taking into account earnest \r\n  money that he had not actually received, further depleting the trust account.\r\nRespondent has advised ODC that he has deposited personal \r\n  funds into the trust account to ensure that no client suffers as a result of \r\n  the theft or respondentâ€™s bookkeeping errors.\r\nLaw\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated \r\n  the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 1.3 (failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client); Rule 1.15(b) (failing to deliver funds to which the client is entitled \r\n  to receive); Rule 5.3(b) (failing to ensure that a nonlawyer assistantâ€™s conduct \r\n  is compatible with the professional responsibilities of the lawyer); and Rule \r\n  8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nRespondent has also violated the following \r\n  provision of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nAdditionally, respondent has violated Rule \r\n  417, SCACR (failing to maintain proper financial records).\r\nConclusion\r\nRespondent fully acknowledges that his actions in the \r\n  aforementioned matters were in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, and Rule 417, SCACR.  We hereby \r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law for eight months, retroactive to \r\n  October 17, 2000. \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   Respondent was placed on interim suspension \r\n    on October 17, 2000.

King, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25571\r\nHeard June 12, 2002 - Filed December \r\n  30, 2002\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHarry C. Wilson, Jr., of Lee, Erter, Wilson, James, Holler &amp; Smith, of \r\n  Sumter, for petitioner.\r\nRonnie A. Sabb, of Kingstree, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  The Court granted certiorari \r\n  to consider the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Collins v. Doe, 343 S.C. \r\n  119, 539 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2000).  The Court of Appeals held that for purposes \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170 (2) (Supp. 2001), a witnessâ€™s sworn trial testimony \r\n  is the functional equivalent of a sworn affidavit.  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent sued an unidentified driver, Petitioner John Doe (â€œDoeâ€), after \r\n  she was involved in an automobile collision with another vehicle.  Respondent \r\n  was traveling on Highway 301 in Clarendon County.  At the point where 301 intersects \r\n  with Highway 521, an automobile driven by Doe failed to yield the right of way \r\n  to Respondent.  To avoid a collision with Doe, Respondent took evasive action, \r\n  and in so doing, collided with the vehicle of Joanne Calvin.  Respondentâ€™s vehicle \r\n  never made contact with Doeâ€™s vehicle.  Respondent suffered injuries in the \r\n  accident, and sought to recover damages under the uninsured motorist coverage \r\n  provided by her automobile insurance policy.\r\nRespondent sued Doe and the case went to trial.  After Respondent \r\n  presented her case, Doe moved for directed verdict.  The basis for Doeâ€™s motion \r\n  was Respondentâ€™s failure to produce an affidavit of a witness, as prescribed \r\n  by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170 (2) (Supp. 2001).1  Although Respondent did not produce a witness-signed \r\n  affidavit, at trial she produced a witness who testified that a vehicle driven \r\n  by Doe caused the accident.  Respondent argued the witnessâ€™s testimony satisfied \r\n  the requirements of Â§ 38-77-170 (2).\r\nThe trial court found that Respondentâ€™s failure to produce an affidavit \r\n  was fatal to her cause of action, and granted Doeâ€™s directed verdict motion.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the witnessâ€™s trial testimony was the \r\n  functional equivalent of a sworn affidavit.  We granted Doeâ€™s petition for certiorari.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in determining that a witnessâ€™s testimony at trial \r\n  is the functional equivalent of the affidavit required by Â§ 38-77-170 (2)?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nDoe contends the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the circuit \r\n  court.  We agree.\r\nWhere a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys \r\n  a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory \r\n  interpretation and the Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.  \r\n  City of Columbia v. American Civil Liberties Union of S.C., Inc., 323 \r\n  S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996).  Where the terms of the statute are clear, \r\n  the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.  Id. \r\n \r\n\r\nThe legislature unambiguously required that a plaintiff seeking to \r\n  recover against her uninsured motorist coverage for the negligence of an unknown \r\n  John Doe driver strictly comply with the plain language of the statute.  The \r\n  current statute is titled â€œConditions to sue or recover under uninsured \r\n  motorist provision when owner or operator of motor vehicle causing injury or \r\n  damage is unknown.â€  (Emphasis supplied).\r\nOur General Assembly first enacted a John Doe statute in 1963.  The \r\n  statute as first enacted required â€œphysical contact with the unknown vehicleâ€ \r\n  before the plaintiff could recover.  See Act No. 312, 1963 S.C. Acts \r\n  535.  \r\nIn 1987, the General Assembly relaxed the physical contact requirement, \r\n  and amended the John Doe statute to provide that a plaintiff has no right of \r\n  action or recovery unless â€œthe injury or damage was caused by physical contact \r\n  with the unknown vehicle, or the accident must have been witnessed by someone \r\n  other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle.â€  Act No. 166, 1987 \r\n  S.C. Acts 1122.  Under the 1987 amendment, a witness-sworn affidavit was not \r\n  required.\r\nThe legislature again amended the statute in 1989, and added the \r\n  sworn affidavit requirement.  The statute at large effecting this most recent \r\n  amendment provides that the act is â€œto amend section 38-77-170 relating to the \r\n  requirements to recover under the uninsured motorist provisions when the \r\n  at-fault party is unknown, so as to require a witness to the accident \r\n  to sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts about the accident \r\n  and to provide a warning statement to be displayed on the affidavit.â€  Act No. \r\n  148, 1989 S.C. Acts 439 (emphasis supplied).\r\nAs written, section 38-77-170 contains requirements necessary to \r\n  support a plaintiffâ€™s â€œright of action.â€  Blackâ€™s defines â€œright of actionâ€ \r\n  as:\r\n\r\n1.  The right to bring a specific case to court.  2.  A right that can be enforced \r\n  by legal action; a chose in action.  Cf. cause of action.\r\n\r\nBlackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1324 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed, \r\n  West 1999). Without a sworn affidavit, a plaintiff has no right of action.  In other words, \r\n  without the affidavit, she has no right to bring her case to court.\r\n This Court has historically required strict compliance with the statute \r\n  allowing an insured to sue her own insurer where damages are caused by an unknown \r\n  driver.  In Criterion Ins. Co. v. Hoffmann, 258 S.C. 282, 188 S.E.2d \r\n  459 (1972), an insured sued his insurer seeking to recover against the uninsured \r\n  motorist coverage of his policy.  The statute2 required that service \r\n  of process be accomplished by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint \r\n  to the insurance commissioner.  The insured delivered to the insurance commissioner \r\n  a copy of the summons, but not a copy of the complaint.  The Court affirmed \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the insured could not recover because he failed \r\n  to comply with the statutory provisions regarding service of process.  The Court \r\n  remarked: \r\n\r\nThe right to sue and collect from oneâ€™s own liability insurance carrier in case \r\n  of a loss caused by a hit-and-run driver or other driver of an uninsured automobile \r\n  is a creature of the legislature.  Except for the statute, and endorsements \r\n  required, no right exists to recover from oneâ€™s own insurance carrier.  One \r\n  must look to the terms of the uninsured motorist statute and policy endorsements \r\n  and comply therewith to get the benefit of law. . . .\r\nIt is the province of the lawmakers to create a right of action, to provide \r\n  for process and to declare the procedure for collecting from oneâ€™s own insurance \r\n  carrier. . . .\r\nThe terms of the statute . . . are clear and not ambiguous.  This being true, \r\n  there is no room for construction and we are required to apply the statute according \r\n  to its literal meaning.  Most courts take a liberal view when dealing with the \r\n  question of coverage; however, the procedural obligations that the insured must \r\n  discharge in order to recover, since they are prescribed by statute, are viewed \r\n  by the courts as mandatory, and strict compliance with them is a prerequisite \r\n  to recover.\r\n\r\nId. at 290-92, 188 S.E.2d at 462-63.\r\nThis Court held that proof of physical contact, a requirement contained \r\n  in the predecessor statute to Section 38-77-170, was a condition precedent to \r\n  a plaintiffâ€™s right of action against an unknown John Doe defendant.  See \r\n  Wynn v. Doe, 255 S.C. 509, 180 S.E.2d 95 (1971).\r\nIn Wynn v. Doe, the plaintiff brought suit against unknown \r\n  motorist John Doe after the plaintiff drove her motorcycle through a slippery \r\n  substance on the highway and crashed.  The plaintiff sued the unknown driver \r\n  of the vehicle responsible for laying the substance on the highway.  The plaintiff \r\n  admitted that there had been no physical contact between her motorcycle and \r\n  the unknown driverâ€™s vehicle. \r\nThe John Doe statute under consideration in Wynn provided \r\n  that:\r\n\r\nIf the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or \r\n  property damage to the insured be unknown, there shall be no right of action \r\n  or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision, unless . . .\r\n(2) The injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 46-750.34 (Supp. 1970).3  The trial court granted judgment in favor of the \r\n  defendant, holding that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action \r\n  because there had been no physical contact between the unknown vehicle and the \r\n  plaintiffâ€™s motorcycle.  This Court agreed, and strictly construed the statute:\r\n\r\nThe right to recover for the negligence of an unknown motorist is determined, \r\n  under the plain terms of Section 46-750.34(2), by whether or not the injury \r\n  was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle. . . .  In the words \r\n  of the statute, there is â€˜no right of action or recovery under the uninsured \r\n  motorist provision, unless * * * the injury or damage was caused by physical \r\n  contact with the unknown vehicle.â€™  The statute makes proof of physical contact \r\n  a condition precedent in any case for the recovery of damages caused \r\n  by an unknown driver and vehicle.  There are no exceptions to this rule. \r\n  . . .  It being agreed that there was no physical contact between the unknown \r\n  vehicle and the motorcycle operated by the appellant, the absence of any such \r\n  physical contact is fatal to her cause of action.\r\nThe appellant contends that since there was actual and physical contact with \r\n  the chemical substance dumped or spilled onto the public highway by an unidentified \r\n  and unknown vehicle, such meets the â€˜physical contactâ€™ requirement of Section \r\n  46-750.34(2) of the Code.  This contention is of no consequence because here \r\n  the indispensable element of â€˜physical contact with the unknown vehicleâ€™ is \r\n  absent and, therefore, to adopt the view advanced by the appellant would defeat \r\n  the clear and unambiguous legislative intent expressed in the statute. . . .\r\n\r\nWynn v. Doe, at 511-12, 180 S.E.2d at 96 (emphasis supplied; citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nCourts have likewise required strict compliance with the current \r\n  version of the John Doe statute.  In Morehead v. Doe, 324 S.C. 559, 479 \r\n  S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 1996), the plaintiff did not report the accident to the \r\n  appropriate police authority until eight months after the accident.  The trial \r\n  court ruled that the plaintiffâ€™s belated report satisfied Â§ 38-77-170 (1).  \r\n  The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that:  \r\n\r\nThe report to a police authority must be made, as the statute requires, â€˜within \r\n  a reasonable time.â€™ . . .  Indeed, because a person is presumed to know the \r\n  law . . . , Morehead is presumed to have known on July 21, 1989, the date of \r\n  the accident, she had no right of action unless she reported the accident to \r\n  an appropriate police authority within a reasonable time.\r\nThe fact that [the insurer] possessed the same information \r\n  that Morehead reported to the police authority is also of no significance.  \r\n  By not reporting the accident far earlier, Morehead deprived [the insurer] of \r\n  meaningful police assistance in investigating the accident and identifying the \r\n  at-fault motorist. . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 562-63, 479 S.E.2d at 818-19 (citation omitted).\r\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals held that the purpose of the sworn \r\n  affidavit requirement is served where a witness testifies at trial.  We disagree.  \r\n  We discern three purposes for the sworn affidavit requirement.  The obvious \r\n  purpose, fraud prevention, is seemingly served by the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion.  \r\n  By offering sworn trial testimony, the witness subjects herself to the criminal \r\n  penalties for perjury.  However, the statute reflects that the legislatureâ€™s \r\n  chosen vehicle for fraud prevention under these circumstances is a sworn affidavit \r\n  prominently displaying the prescribed disclaimer.  The disclaimer alerts the \r\n  affiant that she may be subject to criminal penalties for providing untrue information. \r\n  The affidavit also allows the defendant, at trial, to cross examine the witness \r\n  regarding the statement.  The Court of Appealsâ€™ holding forecloses the defendantâ€™s \r\n  ability to conduct cross examination regarding the witnessâ€™s statement in the \r\n  affidavit. \r\nIn addition, the affidavit constitutes tangible evidence that the \r\n  insured has a good faith basis for making the claim.\r\n Finally, the sworn affidavit requirement fulfills a notice function:  \r\n  Providing, upon request, the defendant-insurer with information relating to \r\n  the validity of the plaintiffâ€™s case.4  Without the affidavit, and without \r\n  the opportunity to interview the witness, the insurer is deprived of valuable \r\n  factual information with which to assess and evaluate the claim.\r\nThe plain language of Â§ 38-77-170 requires that where the accident \r\n  involves no physical contact between the insuredâ€™s vehicle and the unidentified \r\n  vehicle, the accident â€œmust have been witnessed by someone other than \r\n  the owner or operator of the insured vehicleâ€ and the â€œwitness must sign \r\n  an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained therein.â€  \r\n  The statute further prescribes a disclaimer and provides that the disclaimer \r\n  â€œmust be prominently displayed on the face of the affidavit.â€  Under \r\n  the rules of statutory interpretation, use of words such as â€œshallâ€ or â€œmustâ€ \r\n  indicates the legislatureâ€™s intent to enact a mandatory requirement.  See \r\n  e.g., In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001); South \r\n  Carolina Police Officers Retirement Sys. v. Spartanburg, 301 S.C. 188, 391 \r\n  S.E.2d 239 (1990); Starnes v. South Carolina Dept. of Public Safety, \r\n  342 S.C. 216, 535 S.E.2d 665 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nA plaintiffâ€™s strict compliance with the affidavit requirement is \r\n  mandatory.  The Court of Appeals excused this mandatory requirement where the \r\n  plaintiff offers up a â€œfunctional equivalentâ€ of an affidavit.  The statute \r\n  makes no provision for the functional equivalent of an affidavit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ holding creates an exception where none previously \r\n  existed.  Both this Court and the Court of Appeals have held that strict compliance \r\n  with Â§ 38-77-170 is a prerequisite to maintaining a cause of action under that \r\n  statute.  The plain language of the statute supports this conclusion.  Because \r\n  Respondent failed to produce a sworn witness affidavit as mandated by Â§ 38-77-170 \r\n  (2), we REVERSE the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate \r\n  opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  I respectfully dissent.  \r\n  In my view, the majorityâ€™s opinion ignores the clear intent of the legislature \r\n  by holding that sworn testimony by an eye-witness is not the functional equivalent \r\n  of a sworn affidavit for purposes of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170(2) (Supp. 2001).  \r\n  Section 38-77-170 governs when a motorist can recover under an uninsured motorist \r\n  provision when the at-fault motorist is unknown.  \r\nOriginally, an action for recovery against \r\n  an unknown driver was permitted only when the damages were caused by physical \r\n  contact with the unknown driver.  See Act No. 312, 1963 S.C. Acts 535.  \r\n  As the majority points out, the General Assembly relaxed the physical contact \r\n  requirement in 1987 by allowing an action to proceed when the accident was â€œwitnessed \r\n  by someone other than the owner or operator of the vehicle.â€  Acts No. 166, \r\n  1987 S.C. Acts 1122.  In 1989, the General Assembly amended the statute again, \r\n  adding the sworn affidavit requirement.  Act No. 148, 1989 S.C. Acts 439.\r\nThe majority reasons that a sworn affidavit accomplishes \r\n  three objectives:  fraud prevention, meaningful cross-examination, and prior \r\n  notice to the insurer for purposes of claim evaluation.  I agree wholeheartedly \r\n  that the legislature intended for the sworn affidavit requirement to prevent \r\n  fraudulent claims.  However, I disagree that the legislature also intended for \r\n  the affidavit to allow for more effective cross-examination of the witness at \r\n  trial or for it to serve a notice function.  \r\nThe ability to cross-examine a witness effectively \r\n  at trial does not depend on having a prior statement of the witness.  If anything, \r\n  a witnessâ€™s testimony at trial should be deemed more, not less, reliable \r\n  than a statement in a sworn affidavit.  Further, as the majority points out \r\n  in footnote 4, the statute requires separately that the insured report the accident \r\n  to the police within a reasonable time period after the accident.  This provision \r\n  ensures that the defendant-insurer gets information collected by the police, \r\n  valuable to the assessment of the insuredâ€™s claim, in a timely manner.  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170(1); See Morehead v. Doe, 324 S.C. 559, 479 S.E.2d \r\n  817 (Ct. App. 1996).  I respectfully disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that the affidavit is intended to serve as an additional form of notice \r\n  to the insurer.\r\nIn conclusion, I believe the legislature intended \r\n  for the sworn affidavit to prevent motorists from filing fraudulent claims, \r\n  and sworn testimony, by an eye-witness at trial, ensures against fraud even \r\n  more effectively than the sworn affidavit.  Therefore, I would AFFIRM \r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding that sworn testimony is the functional equivalent \r\n  of a sworn affidavit for purposes of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170(2). \r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170 is entitled:\r\n  Conditions to sue or recover under uninsured motorist provision when owner \r\n    or operator of motor vehicle causing injury or damage is unknown.\r\n  The statute provides:\r\n  \r\n  If the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or \r\n    property damage to the insured is unknown, there is no right of action \r\n    or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision, unless:\r\n  (1) the insured or someone in his behalf has reported the accident to some appropriate \r\n    police authority within a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, after \r\n    its occurrence;\r\n  (2) the injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle, \r\n    or the accident must have been witnessed by someone other than the owner \r\n    or operator of the insured vehicle; provided however, the witness must sign \r\n    an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained \r\n    in the affidavit;\r\n  (3) the insured was not negligent in failing to determine the identity of the \r\n    other vehicle and the driver of the other vehicle at the time of the accident.\r\n  The following statement must be prominently displayed on the face of the affidavit \r\n    provided in subitem (2) above:  A FALSE STATEMENT CONCERNING THE FACTS CONTAINED \r\n    IN THIS AFFIDAVIT MAY SUBJECT THE PERSON MAKING THE FALSE STATEMENT TO CRIMINAL \r\n    PENALTIES AS PROVIDED BY LAW.\r\n  (Emphasis supplied).\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n  2 S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 46-750.35 (1962). \r\n\r\n \r\n  3 In 1987, the legislature renumbered \r\n    the John Doe statute and placed it in its current section, Â§ 38-77-170.  Act \r\n    No. 155, 1987 S.C. Acts 385.\r\n\r\n \r\n  4 The Court of Appeals recognized that requiring the \r\n    insured to notify the police within a reasonable time after the accident (codified \r\n    at Â§ 38-77-170 (1)) provided the defendant-insurer with information valuable \r\n    to its assessment of the claim.
