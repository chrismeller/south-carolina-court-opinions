Weissenstein, both of Ballard Watson Weissenstein, of\r\n          West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ PER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and\r\n  respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to\r\n  Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  agrees to the imposition of a public reprimand or definite suspension not to\r\n  exceed two (2) years.Â  In addition, respondent agrees to complete the Ethics\r\n  School and Trust Account School portions of the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\n  Program within six (6) months of the issuance of a public reprimand or before\r\n  seeking reinstatement from a suspension.Â  He further agrees to pay the costs\r\n  incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) within thirty (30) days of the\r\n  imposition of discipline.Â  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â \r\n  Further, we order respondent to complete the Ethics School and Trust Account\r\n  School portions of the Legal Ethics and Practice Program within six (6) months\r\n  of the date of this opinion and to the pay the costs incurred in this matter no\r\n  later than thirty (30) days from the date of this opinion.Â  The facts, as set\r\n  forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn November 2009, respondent agreed to assist Client in\r\n  recovering funds from her former employer.Â  Client believed she was due funds\r\n  from unused vacation time.Â  In a meeting with Client's former employer,\r\n  respondent learned that, pursuant to company policy, Client was not owed any\r\n  money for unused vacation time.Â  \r\nOver the next year, Client regularly called respondent's\r\n  office requesting updates regarding her claim.Â  Respondent assured Client that\r\n  the matter was progressing even though respondent knew the former employer\r\n  denied any liability and that Client did not have a viable claim.Â  \r\nOn December 17, 2010, respondent wrote Client explaining he\r\n  had an offer of $592.32 representing 49.36 hours at $12.00 per hour.Â \r\n  Additionally, the letter stated respondent had over two hours of work on the\r\n  case, but he was willing to reduce his fee to $150.00 so Client's total\r\n  recovery would be $442.32.Â  This letter contained false information because\r\n  respondent had not pursued the matter beyond his initial meeting with the former\r\n  employer and had not received a settlement offer.Â  The letter requested Client\r\n  advise respondent if she would accept the offer. \r\nWhen respondent had not heard from Client by December 22,\r\n  2010, he sent her another letter.Â  In this undated letter, respondent advised\r\n  Client of the same offer and his reduction in fee.Â  Respondent also noted that\r\n  he knew Client would like to have the money by Christmas.Â  \r\nUpon her receipt of the letter in mid-December 2010, Client\r\n  called respondent and accepted the purported offer.Â  Despite Client's prompt\r\n  response to respondent's letter, respondent did not communicate with Client\r\n  again for almost two months.Â  On February 18, 2011, respondent wrote to Client\r\n  apologizing for the delay and providing her with a check in the amount of\r\n  $442.32 written on his general account.Â  Respondent represents he paid personal\r\n  funds to Client because he knew she needed money.Â  \r\nLAW \r\nÂ Respondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has\r\n  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, particularly Rule\r\n  1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing\r\n  client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of\r\n  matter and promptly comply with requests for information); Rule 2.1 (in\r\n  representing client, lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment\r\n  and render candid advice); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer\r\n  to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit\r\n  or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for\r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the\r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for\r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice).Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public\r\n  reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and\r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  In addition, we order\r\n  respondent to complete the Ethics School and Trust Account School portions of\r\n  the Legal Ethics and Practice Program within six (6) months of the date of this\r\n  opinion and to pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of\r\n  this matter by ODC and the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of\r\n  this opinion.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27064","title":"Michau v.

Dr. Lawless's medical reports indicate\r\n  that Employee complained of arthritis-related symptoms involving pain and\r\n  swelling in his hands and redness in his joints.[2]Â \r\n  In August 2005, Dr. Lawless referred Employee for a total body bone scan, which\r\n  also found evidence of rheumatoid arthritis.Â  Consequently, he referred Employee\r\n  to a rheumatologist, Dr. Mitch Twinning, who examined Employee on May 24, 2006,\r\n  and diagnosed him with rheumatoid arthritis.Â  Employee continued treatment with\r\nDr. Lawless for this disease until June 2006.\r\n On\r\n  December 1, 2006, Dr. Michael Bohan, an orthopaedic specialist, began treating\r\n  Employee and reported that x-ray data of the left shoulder &quot;show[ed]\r\n  rather significant degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint as well as\r\n  the AC joint.&quot;Â  Employee eventually underwent surgery on his left shoulder,\r\n  and on November 21, 2008, Dr. Bohan issued a letter to Employee's attorney\r\nstating:\r\n\r\nI do believe within a reasonable degree of medical\r\n  certainty that these repetitive work activities over the years of his\r\nshoulders [sic] have resulted in his severe osteoarthritis of both shoulders.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n Seeking\r\n  independent verification of Employee's claim, Employer engaged Dr. Chris\r\n  Tountas, a specialist in the treatment of arthritis, to perform a medical\r\nevaluation of Employee.Â  Dr. Tountas opined:\r\n\r\nBased on the history, physical examination, objective\r\n  findings, and review of available records, it is my opinion that\r\n  [Employee] has had a long history of arthritis involving multiple joints with\r\n  diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis . . . . There is no indication from the job\r\n  description or his employment that would relate any of his shoulder problems to\r\n  his work driving a road grader.Â  In my opinion this is a natural\r\n  progression of a preexisting condition.Â  The preexisting condition in my opinion\r\nwould ultimately result in a need for treatment and the recent surgery.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n The\r\n  Commission denied Employee's claim on the grounds that &quot;the greater weight\r\n  of the medical evidence reflects [Employee's] upper extremity and shoulder\r\n  problems are related to pre-existing osteoarthritis and/or rheumatoid arthritis\r\n  and not caused or aggravated by his employment with Georgetown County.&quot;Â  In\r\n  reaching this conclusion, the Commission considered all of the medical evidence\r\n  including Dr. Tountas's report.Â  Employee disputes the admissibility of Dr.\r\n  Tountas's report under South Carolina Code section 42-1-172 because it was not\r\n  stated &quot;to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.&quot;Â  Employee\r\n  argues that without this evidence, the remaining competent evidence would support\r\nEmployee's claim of sustaining a compensable repetitive trauma injury.Â  \r\nIssues\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether section 42-1-172(C)\r\ngoverns the admissibility of evidence in a workers' compensation claim.\r\nII.&nbsp; Whether the Commission properly\r\nconstrued and applied section 42-1-172 in admitting Dr. Tountas's statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard\r\nof Review\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\r\n  governs appeals from the decisions of the Commission.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    1-23-380 (Supp. 2010); Lark v. Bi-Lo,\r\nInc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Under the APA, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\n  Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may\r\nreverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5).Â  \r\nAnalysis\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I.&nbsp;\r\nAdmissibility\r\nof Evidence under section 42-1-172\r\nEmployer contends that South Carolina Code section\r\n  42-1-172 does not govern the admissibility of evidence in a workers' compensation\r\n  claim involving a repetitive trauma injury. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n42-1-172 (Supp. 2010).Â  We disagree. \r\nSpecifically, Employer argues that admissibility of\r\n  evidence in this case is governed solely by section 1-23-330, which provides\r\n  that &quot;in contested cases . . . [i]rrelevant, immaterial or unduly\r\n  repetitious evidence shall be excluded.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    1-23-330 (2005).Â  However, Employer\r\ncites no supporting authorities for this interpretation.Â  \r\nIn our view, section 1-23-330 establishes a minimum\r\n  standard that applies generally, but not exclusively.Â  On the other hand, section\r\n    42-1-172(C) expressly creates an\r\n  additional heightened standard for repetitive trauma injury cases.Â \r\n  Specifically, it requires &quot;medical evidence,&quot; in the form of\r\n  &quot;expert opinion or testimony [to be] stated to a reasonable degree of\r\n  medical certainty.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-172(C).Â  Indeed, section\r\n    42-1-172(C) commands that the &quot;[c]ompensability of a repetitive trauma injury\r\n  must be determined only under the provisions of this statute.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added); see also Murphy v.\r\n    Corning, 393 S.C. 77, 84, 710 S.E.2d 454, 458 (Ct. App. 2011) (&quot;[T]he compensability of a repetitive trauma\r\n  injury must be determined by the Commission under the provisions of [section]\r\n  42-1-172 . . . . [and] the Commission erred by failing to address [section]\r\n42-1-172.&quot;).\r\nThus, in repetitive trauma injury cases such as this,\r\nsection 42-1-172 governs the admissibility of medical evidence.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; II.&nbsp; Commission's\r\nConstruction and Application of section 42-1-172\r\nEmployee argues that the Commission incorrectly\r\n  construed section 42-1-172 by admitting Dr. Tountas's medical evidence, as it\r\n  was not stated &quot;to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.&quot;[3]Â \r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-1-172 provides:\r\nAn injury is not considered a compensable repetitive trauma\r\n  injury unless a commissioner makes a specific finding of fact by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence of a causal connection that is established by\r\n  medical evidence . . . . As used in this section, &quot;medical evidence&quot;\r\n  means expert opinion or testimony stated to a reasonable degree of medical\r\n  certainty, documents, records, or other material that is offered by a licensed\r\nand qualified medical physician. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n42-1-172.\r\n\r\nIt is clear the plain reading of the statute requires that &quot;opinion\r\n  or testimony&quot; must be &quot;stated to a reasonable degree of medical\r\n  certainty.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In contrast, &quot;documents, records, or other\r\n  material&quot; is not similarly modified.Â  Id.Â  As this Court has recognized,\r\n  the &quot;use of the word 'or' in a statute 'is a disjunctive particle that\r\n  marks an alternative.'&quot;Â  K &amp; A\r\n    Acquisition Group, LLC v. Island Pointe, LLC, 383 S.C. 563, 580, 682 S.E.2d\r\n    252, 261 (2009).Â  Here, the legislature\r\n  intentionally used &quot;or&quot; after a series of commas to expand the\r\n  definition of &quot;medical evidence&quot; beyond &quot;opinion or testimony.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-172.Â  This\r\n  Court has said that words should be given &quot;their plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the\r\n  statute's operation.&quot;Â  State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339,\r\n    350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010) (citation omitted).Â  Because the statute does not require that &quot;documents, records, or\r\n  other material&quot; be &quot;stated to a reasonable degree of medical\r\n  certainty,&quot; we will not expand its plain meaning or interpolate this\r\nrequirement.[4]Â  Id.Â  \r\nConsequently, we must address whether Dr. Tountas's statement constitutes an &quot;opinion\r\n  or testimony&quot; that must be &quot;stated to a reasonable degree of medical\r\n  certainty.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    42-1-172.Â  Employer contends that Dr. Tountas's\r\n  letter represents &quot;documents, records, or other material&quot; that need\r\n  not be stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. The Commission agreed with Employer and pointed out that a contrary\r\n  interpretation and application of the statute would require this Court to\r\n  ignore eleven years of Employee's prior medical history and reports merely\r\n  because they do not contain the magic phrase &quot;within a reasonable degree\r\n  of medical certainty.&quot;Â  We note that Employee does not challenge the other\r\n  admitted medical evidence, and therefore the only issue we decide here is the\r\nadmissibility of Dr. Tountas's statement. Â Â Â Â \r\nWhile we recognize that medical &quot;records&quot; will often also contain\r\n  physicians' opinions, in this instance, Dr. Tountas was not Employee's treating\r\n  physician, and Employer specially sought out Dr. Tountas to evaluate Employee\r\n  and issue a medical &quot;opinion&quot; to decide the compensability of\r\n  Employee's claim.Â  Under these facts, Dr. Tountas's letter does not constitute &quot;documents,\r\n  records, or other material,&quot; but is an &quot;opinion or testimony&quot;\r\nthat must be &quot;stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 42-1-172.Â  Â \r\nIn the alternative, Employer also argues that if Dr. Tountas's statement\r\n  constitutes an &quot;opinion or testimony,&quot; the requirement of section\r\n  42-1-172 applies only to claimants and not defendants.Â  The statutory language\r\n  makes no such distinction, so we decline to adopt this forced construction.Â  See Sweat, 386 S.C. at\r\n    350, 688 S.E.2d at 575 (finding words should be given &quot;their plain and\r\n    ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or\r\nexpand the statute's operation.&quot;) (citation omitted). \r\nThus, we reverse the Commission's decision to admit Dr. Tountas's medical\r\nopinion.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand\r\n  the case to the Commission to decide whether the remaining competent evidence\r\n  supports Employee's claim of sustaining a compensable, repetitive trauma\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\nKITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Employee elaborated further, &quot;I mean, it was good.Â  I mean, I had a\r\n  steering wheel that, that I pulled to me, and I had my levers on each side.Â  It\r\n  was right there.Â  I mean, it was justâ€”it was just easy asâ€”almost as eating ice\r\ncream.&quot;Â  \r\n[2] In June 2001, Employee complained of arthritic symptoms in his arms, and Dr.\r\n  Lawless's medical report indicates he suspected Employee suffered from carpal\r\n  tunnel syndrome.Â  In July and November 2001, Employee followed up with Dr.\r\nLawless, again complaining of pain in his arms and hands.Â  \r\n[3] Specifically, the Commission concluded:\r\n\r\nSubsection (C) merely defines what medical evidence is\r\n  necessary to establish causation of a repetitive trauma claim.Â  This provision\r\n  of the Act could not have been intended to require every medical report\r\n  submitted by the parties be stated within a reasonable degree of medical\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n[4] Legislative history also supports this interpretation of\r\n  section 42-1-172.Â  Had the General Assembly intended to require\r\n  &quot;documents, records, or other material&quot; be &quot;stated to a\r\n  reasonable degree of medical certainty,&quot; it would have left the April 4,\r\n  2007 amended and adopted Senate version of this section intact.Â  This version\r\nunambiguously provides:\r\n\r\nAs used in this title, &quot;medical evidence&quot; means\r\n  expert opinion, expert testimony, documents, or other material that is offered\r\n  or stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty by a licensed health care\r\nprovider.\r\n\r\nS. 332,\r\n  reprinted in 4 Senate Journal, South Carolina Regular Session, 2007, at 1662.Â  However,\r\nthe legislature did not adopt this language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27066","title":"In the Matter of James H.

Â The allegations accused Respondent\r\n  of, among other things, making false representations to judges and opposing\r\n  counsel, failing to diligently pursue litigation matters, failing to comply\r\n  with a fee dispute award and several court orders, engaging in conflicts of\r\n  interest, and practicing law while on Interim Suspension.Â  The Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;) filed formal charges against Respondent.\r\n  Â \r\nA Hearing Panel of the Commission (&quot;Hearing\r\n  Panel&quot;) issued its Panel Report, finding Respondent had committed\r\n  misconduct and recommended that Respondent:Â  (1) be disbarred; (2) be ordered\r\n  to pay the costs of the proceedings, attend the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\n  Program and Trust Account school, and pay the fee dispute award prior to\r\n  petitioning for reinstatement; (3) pay a fine in an appropriate amount; and (4)\r\n  comply with such other directives as this Court deems appropriate.Â  Respondent\r\n  raises seven exceptions to the Panel Report. Â We find Respondent committed\r\n  misconduct and impose the following sanctions:Â  a definite suspension of two\r\n  years, which shall run retroactively to the date of Respondent's Interim\r\n  Suspension; payment of the costs of these proceedings; and payment of $1,750 to\r\n  a client as directed by the South Carolina Bar Fee Disputes Resolution Board.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nRespondent, whose office is\r\n  located in Atlanta, Georgia, is licensed to practice law in South Carolina. Â The\r\n  complaints that formed the basis of this disciplinary action involve\r\n  Respondent's conduct from 2001 through 2006.\r\nIn 2005, an attorney filed a\r\n  complaint against Respondent, alleging Respondent created a fictitious medical\r\n  record in conjunction with a 1998 automobile accident case. Â This complaint precipitated\r\n  Respondent's Interim Suspension on September 27, 2005.Â  The Formal Charges in\r\n  this case were not filed until March 10, 2009.[1]Â \r\n  The Hearing Panel heard testimony on the eight complaints over the course of\r\n  January 27, 28, 29, and March 22, 2010, and ultimately issued its report on\r\n  March 15, 2011, wherein it recommended that Respondent be disbarred.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations of Misconduct\r\nRespondent faced formal\r\n  disciplinary charges in connection with the following eight matters:\r\n1.&nbsp; Medical Record Matter\r\nRespondent was retained to\r\n  represent a client who was injured in an automobile accident that occurred on\r\n  May 3, 1995, in Hartsville, South Carolina.Â  Medical records indicate the\r\n  client received injuries to her head, neck, and right knee.Â  Six days after the\r\n  accident, the client sought follow-up care for headaches and knee pain.Â  The\r\n  medical record from this follow-up visit made no mention of any complaint\r\n  concerning the client's heart, and instead noted that the &quot;heart has\r\n  regular rate and rhythm w/o gallops or murmurs.&quot;Â  \r\nApproximately one year later,\r\n  the client began to experience chest discomfort while working out at the YMCA.Â \r\n  Then, while at work on July 31, 1996, the client experienced recurrent chest\r\n  discomfort and was taken to the Byerly Hospital where she was diagnosed as\r\n  having had a &quot;myocardial infarction.&quot;Â  Subsequently, she underwent\r\n  treatment at Providence Hospital for that condition.Â  In a medical record dated\r\n  July 31, 1996, the client's condition was described as &quot;a history of\r\n  recent exertional chest discomfort&quot; that had been ongoing for the\r\n  &quot;last two months.&quot;Â  The record also states that the client was\r\n  &quot;[n]egative for a prior history of heart problems,&quot; and concludes\r\n  that the client had suffered an &quot;[a]cute inferior posterior myocardial\r\n  infarction.&quot;\r\nIn 1998, Respondent filed a\r\n  lawsuit on behalf of the client against the at-fault driver in the 1995\r\n  automobile accident.Â  On April 27, 1998, Respondent sent a document, which appeared\r\n  to be a medical record,[2] as part of the settlement package to the insurance company (Unisun) for the at-fault\r\n  driver.Â  Subsequently, Unisun's claims representative provided Respondent's\r\n  case documents to Andrew McLeod, an attorney retained by Unisun.Â Â Â  McLeod testified\r\n  that he settled the case for the $15,000 policy limit, but clarified that he\r\n  did not participate in the negotiations and primarily drafted the Covenant Not\r\n  to Execute.Â  Â He did, however, believe the document was part of the client's\r\n  medical records.Â  \r\nIn March 2000, Respondent\r\n  filed an amended lawsuit for underinsured motorist coverage. Â Lawrence Orr, the\r\n  attorney who represented the insurance company (Horace Mann) in the\r\n  underinsured motorist coverage claim, received Respondent's case documents from\r\n  McLeod.Â  This package, as well as Respondent's discovery, included the document\r\n  that attributed client's heart problems to the 1995 automobile accident.Â  Orr\r\n  discovered that the document was not included in the medical records he\r\n  independently subpoenaed from the client's medical providers.Â  \r\nMonths after settling the\r\n  case, Orr reported the matter to the ODC by letter dated March 7, 2005.Â  On\r\n  March 24, 2005, Larry Huffstetler, Special Investigator for the South Carolina\r\n  State Attorney General's Office, received the purported medical document.Â  That\r\n  same day, Respondent came to the ODC's office to deliver documents pursuant to a\r\n  subpoena in another disciplinary matter.Â  Upon his arrival, Respondent was taken\r\n  to a conference room and questioned by Investigator Huffstetler and Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Robert Bogan about the document.Â  Respondent denied that\r\n  he had &quot;manufactured or created any medical record&quot; and &quot;offered\r\n  no explanation concerning the source of the suspected false medical\r\n  record.&quot;Â  Based on this matter, this Court placed Respondent on Interim\r\n  Suspension beginning September 27, 2005.Â  \r\nDuring the subsequent\r\n  investigation and at the panel hearing on the formal charges, Respondent\r\n  admitted he had directed an assistant to create the document.Â  Although\r\n  Respondent acknowledged the document had the appearance of a medical record, he\r\n  denied producing it to Unisun or Orr as evidence of a medical record.Â  Instead,\r\n  Respondent claimed that his purpose for creating and producing the document was\r\n  only to communicate his theory of the case during settlement negotiations,\r\n  which was that any settlement for the 1995 automobile accident should include\r\n  expenses for treatment of the client's heart condition.Â  Respondent further\r\n  explained that he had attached a &quot;sticky note&quot; to the document to\r\n  apprise Orr that this document was not a medical record, but rather, his\r\n  version of the damages.Â  Orr testified there was no such note attached to the\r\n  documents that he received.\r\n2.&nbsp; Unauthorized Practice of\r\n  Law\r\nOn June 30, 2005, Respondent\r\n  filed a lawsuit against a nursing home and other medical care providers, naming\r\n  himself as plaintiff &quot;individually and as personal representative of the estate\r\n  of Ruth S. Dickey, deceased&quot; and asserting claims for wrongful death,\r\n  gross negligence, and breach of contract. \r\nAfter Respondent was placed\r\n  on Interim Suspension for the Medical Record Matter, the circuit court granted\r\n  summary judgment to the nursing home on October 12, 2005.Â  Respondent filed a\r\n  motion to reconsider, signing it &quot;James H. Dickey, pro se.&quot;Â  In\r\n  denying the motion, the court referenced Dickey's Interim Suspension and stated\r\n  that &quot;[w]hile Mr. Dickey is authorized to file this pleading in his\r\n  individual capacity, he is not in a position to file this pleading on behalf of\r\n  the Estate.&quot;Â  As a result, the court concluded that &quot;Mr. Dickey's\r\n  efforts to file pleadings on behalf of the Estate by virtue of his being the\r\n  Personal Representative are not proper and not effective, is an unauthorized\r\n  practice of law and are not being considered by the Court . . . .&quot; [3]Â  \r\nOn May 26, 2006, Respondent\r\n  appeared in circuit court to oppose a motion for summary judgment that was filed\r\n  by another defendant in the above-referenced lawsuit.Â  The circuit court\r\n  continued the hearing and ordered Respondent to retain counsel and respond to\r\n  matters pending in the case no later than June 26, 2006.Â  The circuit court\r\n  granted summary judgment when it did not receive responsive pleadings and\r\n  neither Respondent nor counsel for the Estate appeared at the hearing on\r\n  October 3, 2006.Â  The court further ordered that &quot;all claims made on\r\n  behalf of the estate of Ruth S. Dickey against [defendant] are dismissed for\r\n  failure to prosecute, as well as failure to comply with this Court's prior\r\n  Order [to retain counsel and respond not later than June 26, 2006].&quot;[4]\r\n3.&nbsp; Fee Dispute Matter\r\nIn October 2000, Hieshia Wright consulted Respondent\r\n  about an employment discrimination claim.Â  A time sheet summary prepared by\r\n  Respondent reveals that Respondent began work on Wright's case after this\r\n  initial consultation.Â  On February 5, 2001, Respondent met with Wright and her\r\n  husband at a Columbia library and wrote the following on the back of a business\r\n  card:\r\n\r\n  $125 pd;\r\n    consultation.Â  Retainer Fee $1500 plus $250 (preparation and court cost) Will\r\n    Return $1500 if case not filed for suit.Â  2/5/01\r\n\r\nOn July 10, 2001, Respondent\r\n  mailed Wright a proposed Complaint for her approval.Â  In the transmittal\r\n  letter, Respondent indicated that there were &quot;strong&quot; claims to be\r\n  pursued and that the deadline for filing was August 25, 2001.Â  Respondent never\r\n  filed the lawsuit.\r\nOn August 29, 2001, Wright\r\n  wrote Respondent expressing her &quot;disappointment&quot; with his\r\n  representation and requesting a refund of $1,750, the amount paid on February\r\n  5, 2001.Â  Respondent disputed Wright's entitlement to a refund based on her\r\n  misunderstanding regarding the terms of Respondent's representation, her desire\r\n  not to proceed with the lawsuit, and the amount of time Respondent had expended\r\n  in investigating and preparing her claim.\r\nWright sought assistance with\r\n  the fee dispute from the South Carolina Bar by letter dated January 7, 2002,\r\n  which was initially submitted to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.Â  \r\nIn a letter dated April 5,\r\n  2002, an attorney appointed to investigate the fee dispute requested that\r\n  Respondent submit within thirty days certain documents, including fee\r\n  agreements, time and bill records, receipt/disbursement ledgers, and any other\r\n  items Respondent wanted the South Carolina Bar Fee Disputes Resolution Board (Board)\r\n  to consider.Â  Respondent wrote to the investigator advising that the matter was\r\n  the subject of a disciplinary complaint and suggested that it should be handled\r\n  by the ODC; however, he never provided the requested records.Â  In explaining\r\n  his conduct, Respondent pointed out that Wright had also submitted a complaint\r\n  to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel based on the same fee dispute.Â \r\n  Ultimately, the investigator recommended that Respondent refund $1,750 to\r\n  Wright.Â  In a letter dated September 9, 2002, the circuit chair informed\r\n  Respondent and Wright that the Board concurred in the investigator's report and\r\n  recommendation and that the decision was final.[5]Â  \r\nOn October 8, 2002,\r\n  Respondent appealed the Board's decision to the circuit court.Â  The circuit\r\n  court dismissed the appeal with prejudice after Respondent failed to file a\r\n  brief asserting his grounds for relief and failed to appear for the final hearing.Â \r\n  The court also denied Respondent's motion to alter or amend.Â  \r\nOn May 13, 2004, the Board\r\n  filed a Certificate of Non-Compliance as Respondent had not satisfied the fee\r\n  dispute award. Subsequently, Respondent appealed the circuit court's decision\r\n  to the Court of Appeals.Â  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, finding it\r\n  did not have jurisdiction as &quot;there is no appeal from a decision of the\r\n  Resolution of Fee Disputes Board of the South Carolina Bar beyond the circuit\r\n  court as set forth in Rule 416, SCACR, Rule 20.&quot;Â  Wright v. Dickey,\r\n  370 S.C. 517, 521, 636 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied (May 3,\r\n  2007).\r\nWhen the Hearing Panel\r\n  questioned Respondent as to why he had not yet refunded the fee award to\r\n  Wright, Respondent stated that he was &quot;still challenging the ruling in the\r\n  matter&quot; and intended to exhaust his legal remedies, which might include\r\n  federal court.Â  Respondent, however, could not identify any legal action that\r\n  he had taken since his appeal to the Court of Appeals and specifically stated\r\n  that he &quot;can't do anything now.&quot;\r\n4. Conflict of Interest Matter\r\nRespondent's parents divorced\r\n  in 1981.Â  Sometime after the divorce, a dispute arose as to whether\r\n  Respondent's father had complied with the division of certain real property.Â \r\n  Respondent initiated an action in which he represented his mother against his\r\n  father.Â  On January 6, 1997, the family court issued an order that required the\r\n  father to transfer certain property to Respondent's mother.Â  When the father\r\n  did not comply, Respondent filed a Petition for a Rule to Show Cause in April\r\n  2001 to determine whether his father should be held in contempt for failing to\r\n  deed the property as required by the order.\r\nDuring the time that\r\n  Respondent represented his mother adverse to his father, Respondent also\r\n  represented his father in a legal malpractice action.Â  Respondent's\r\n  representation of his father began in 1999 and continued through the conclusion\r\n  of the appeal in June of 2003.Â  Additionally, an opinion by the Court of\r\n  Appeals lists Respondent as the attorney for his mother and father in an appeal\r\n  during this same time period.[6]\r\nRespondent testified both\r\n  parents were aware of his dual representation and he had advised his father\r\n  that the mother's case had priority.Â  There is no evidence in the record to\r\n  refute Respondent's testimony.\r\n5.&nbsp;Failure to Prosecute\r\n  Matters \r\na.&nbsp; Samuel Matter\r\nRespondent represented\r\n  Christina Samuel in a medical malpractice action in Darlington County,\r\n  captioned 2000-CP-16-0076, for injuries allegedly caused to her daughter during\r\n  childbirth in 1997.\r\nÂ By order dated March 22,\r\n  2001, the circuit court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and\r\n  dismissed the case with prejudice for Respondent's failure to answer discovery\r\n  and failure to prosecute.Â  In so ruling, the court found that Respondent had\r\n  failed to provide any discovery as to potential experts and failed to provide\r\n  any expert affidavits to support an alleged deviation from the standard of\r\n  care.Â  With respect to Respondent's failure to prosecute, the judge noted that\r\n  Respondent had sought multiple continuances as to the defendants' motion to\r\n  dismiss.Â  Based on Respondent's failure to appear at a scheduled hearing, the\r\n  circuit court issued an order dated June 30, 2000, which stated &quot;Dickey is\r\n  on notice that a subsequent failure to appear without prior approval by the\r\n  court may result in any sanctions the presiding judge may deem appropriate; the\r\n  sending of a fax without the court's subsequent approval is insufficient to\r\n  excuse any failure to appear.&quot;Â  The defendants' motion to dismiss was\r\n  ultimately heard via conference call.\r\nÂ  Â Â Subsequently, a hearing\r\n  was set for the defendants' motions for summary judgment on the morning of\r\n  Monday, March 12, 2001.Â Â  On March 12, 2001, the court received a faxed letter\r\n  from Respondent in which he requested a continuance.Â  Respondent did not fax\r\n  the letter to defense counsel, but instead left a telephone message sometime\r\n  over the weekend informing counsel of the continuance request.Â  Without\r\n  receiving prior approval from the court, Respondent failed to appear at the\r\n  scheduled hearing. \r\nRespondent appealed the\r\n  circuit court's order dismissing Samuel's case to the Court of Appeals.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals summarily affirmed the circuit court's order.Â  Samuel v. Brown\r\n    et al., Op. No. 2003-UP-751 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 18, 2003).Â  This\r\n  Court denied Respondent's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nWhen questioned by the\r\n  Hearing Panel regarding his representation of Samuel, Respondent claimed that\r\n  he continued to represent her but was unsure whether he had advised her that\r\n  certiorari was denied by this Court.Â  Respondent admitted that it had been\r\n  years since he had spoken with Samuel and that he had never informed her of his\r\n  Interim Suspension.Â  In his defense, Respondent attempted to establish that he\r\n  was unable to get in contact with Samuel because her telephone was always\r\n  &quot;turned off&quot; and her address had changed from that listed on the fee\r\n  agreement.\r\nÂ Â  Â Samuel testified the last\r\n  time she spoke with Respondent was approximately four or five years ago when he\r\n  informed her that the case was being appealed to the Supreme Court.Â  Samuel\r\n  stated that Respondent never explained to her why the case had been dismissed.Â \r\n  She further testified that she first learned the status of her case two weeks\r\n  before the panel hearing when Bogan met with her regarding her testimony.\r\nb.&nbsp; Suber Matter\r\nOn September 29, 2000,\r\n  Respondent filed a lawsuit in Richland County on behalf of a client, Ida Mae\r\n  Suber, who was injured in an automobile accident.Â  By order dated July 31,\r\n  2001, the circuit court dismissed the case based on Respondent's failure to\r\n  prosecute.Â  After dismissing the insurance carrier with prejudice, the court\r\n  further stated that &quot;[i]n the event the Plaintiff shall attempt to\r\n  commence another action against the [remaining defendants], such shall not be\r\n  commenced before and until attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of Five\r\n  Hundred and no/100 ($500.00) Dollars have been paid to each of the attorneys\r\n  for the Defendants, Robert A. McKenzie and Robert W. Buffington.&quot;Â  \r\nThereafter, Respondent filed\r\n  a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure.Â  A year later, while this motion was pending, Respondent\r\n  filed an identical suit on behalf of Suber on August 1, 2002 without paying the\r\n  court-ordered fees. Â The circuit court dismissed this lawsuit due, in part, to Respondent's\r\n  failure to comply with the prior order.Â  Respondent acknowledged that he did\r\n  not pay the court-ordered fees before filing the second lawsuit, but explained\r\n  he took that course of action in order to compel a ruling on his motion for\r\n  reconsideration because his repeated requests for a ruling were not effective. Â At\r\n  the time of the hearing to dismiss the second lawsuit, the Rule 59(e) motion\r\n  had not been ruled upon. \r\nc. Darlington/Florence County\r\n  Matter\r\nRespondent represented his\r\n  father as the plaintiff in a matter captioned Dickey v. Holloway, 1999-CP-16-0346,\r\n  which was pending in Darlington County and appeared on the roster for the week\r\n  of March 5, 2001.Â  Respondent also represented the plaintiff in a matter\r\n  captioned Arthur v. Sexton Dental Clinic, et al., 1998-CP-21-684, which\r\n  was pending in Florence County and appeared on the roster for the week of March\r\n  5, 2001.\r\nOn Thursday, March 1, 2001,\r\n  opposing counsel in the Florence County case called Respondent to inform him\r\n  the case was on the roster but was not ready for trial.Â  On the morning of\r\n  Friday, March 2, 2001, Respondent called the office of the Honorable Paul M.\r\n  Burch, the presiding judge in Florence County, and spoke with the judge's law\r\n  clerk.Â  Respondent informed the law clerk that the Florence County case was not\r\n  ready for trial.Â  Written notice of the continuance in the Florence County case\r\n  was faxed to Respondent at 11:20 a.m. that same day with a message that stated:\r\n\r\n  Please\r\n    be advised that Judge Burch has GRANTED your request for a continuance beyond\r\n    March 2001 for the following matters:\r\n  98-CP-21-684,\r\n    Arthur v. Sexton Dental Clinic et al.\r\n  Kindly\r\n    advise the other counsel and the Clerk of Court for this continuance.\r\n\r\nBecause Respondent did not\r\n  recall receiving this fax, he testified he only had a &quot;good faith&quot;\r\n  belief that it would be continued. \r\nOn the same day, Respondent\r\n  sent a letter to the Honorable Sidney Floyd, the presiding judge in Darlington\r\n  County, concerning the roster meeting scheduled for March 5, 2001.Â  The letter,\r\n  which was clocked as filed by the Clerk of Court at 4:29 p.m. on March 2, 2001,\r\n  stated that Respondent had a conflict because the Florence County and\r\n  Darlington County cases were both scheduled for trial or motions during the\r\n  week of March 5, 2001.Â  The letter further stated that the Arthur v. Sexton\r\n    Dental Clinic et al., was a &quot;Trialâ€”3/5/01.&quot;\r\nÂ  On Monday, March 5, 2001,\r\n  Respondent appeared for the roster meeting in Darlington County even though\r\n  opposing counsel failed to appear.Â  The testimony is divergent as to what\r\n  transpired during the roster meeting.Â  Respondent testified that he told Judge\r\n  Floyd that he was ready to proceed to trial in Dickey v. Holloway.Â  A\r\n  former Darlington County Clerk of Court employee also testified that Respondent\r\n  appeared and said he was ready for trial.Â  Additionally, the Darlington County\r\n  roster sheets for the week of March 5, 2001 contained handwritten notations\r\n  that appeared to support the testimony of Respondent and the Darlington County\r\n  Clerk of Court employee.Â  \r\nIn contrast, the Darlington\r\n  County Clerk of Court testified that Respondent told Judge Floyd that he could\r\n  not try the Darlington County case as the Florence County case was scheduled\r\n  for trial and he was selecting a jury that day.[7]Â \r\n  The Clerk further testified that once it was determined that the Florence\r\n  County case was not scheduled for trial, Judge Floyd ordered Respondent to\r\n  appear on Wednesday, March 7, 2001, to proceed to trial on Dickey v.\r\n    Holloway.Â  Because Respondent did not appear on March 7, Judge Floyd\r\n  dismissed the case for failure to prosecute.Â  \r\nIn his defense, Respondent\r\n  explained that he fell ill on the night of March 6 and was unable to return to\r\n  work until March 15.Â  As corroborative evidence, Respondent offered a doctor's\r\n  excuse dated March 9, 2001.Â Â Â  Respondent also offered into evidence an\r\n  affidavit, which was filed with the Darlington County Clerk of Court's office\r\n  on April 6, 2001, wherein he stated that when he became ill he notified the\r\n  Darlington County Clerk of Court's office on March 7, 2001, and requested continuances\r\n  on all of his pending cases.Â  The affidavit stated that due to Respondent's\r\n  illness, he was unable to work until March 27, 2001.Â  The former Darlington\r\n  County Clerk of Court employee also testified that Respondent appeared ill when\r\n  he attended the March 5, 2001 roster meeting.Â  She further testified that on\r\n  March 6, 2001, she was instructed by the Darlington County Clerk of Court to\r\n  notify opposing counsel in Respondent's cases (scheduled for the week of March\r\n  5, 2001) that Respondent would be absent and that they should appear to have\r\n  their cases dismissed. \r\nB. Aggravating and Mitigating\r\n  Circumstances\r\nIn terms of aggravating circumstances the Hearing\r\n  Panel considered the following:Â  (1) Respondent's dishonest or selfish motive,\r\n  particularly with respect to the Medical Record Matter and the Suber Matter;\r\n  (2) Respondent's pattern of misconduct; (3) seven of the eight allegations of\r\n  misconduct were proven by clear and convincing evidence;[8] (4) Respondent falsely represented to the ODC's investigator that he had not\r\n  manufactured the document that appeared to be a medical record; (5)\r\n  Respondent's refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct and his\r\n  continued attack on the court system as being &quot;corrupt&quot;; (6) the vulnerability\r\n  of Wright, who received &quot;no meaningful services&quot; despite her payment\r\n  of a fee, and Samuel, who was made to believe that her case was still pending;\r\n  and (7) Respondent's indifference to making restitution as he has not satisfied\r\n  the Board's award of unearned fees to Wright.\r\nIn mitigation, the Hearing Panel considered that:Â  (1)\r\n  Respondent had no prior disciplinary record; and (2) the disciplinary\r\n  proceedings had been pending for some amount of time while Respondent has\r\n  remained on Interim Suspension.\r\nC.&nbsp; Hearing Panel's Conclusions\r\n  and Recommended Sanctions\r\nBased on Respondent's\r\n  misconduct, the Hearing Panel concluded that Respondent had violated the\r\n  following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (competent\r\n  representation to a client requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness\r\n  and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation); Rule 1.3 (a\r\n  lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a\r\n  client); Rule 1.4(a) (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about\r\n  the status of a matter); Rule 1.5 (a lawyer shall not charge or collect an\r\n  unreasonable fee); Rule 1.7 (conflict of interest); Rule 1.16(d) (upon\r\n  termination of representation, a lawyer shall refund any advance payment of fee\r\n  or expense that has not been earned or incurred); Rule 3.3 (candor toward the\r\n  tribunal); Rule 3.4 (fairness to opposing party and counsel); Rule 4.1 (lawyer\r\n  shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact to a third person);\r\n  Rule 5.5 (unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.1(a) (a lawyer shall not\r\n  knowingly make a false statement of material fact in connection with a\r\n  disciplinary matter); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer\r\n  to violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule\r\n  8.4(d) (engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or\r\n  misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (engage in conduct that is prejudicial to\r\n  the administration of justice).\r\nAdditionally, the Hearing\r\n  Panel found Respondent violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violate or attempt to violate the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (willfully fail to appear\r\n  personally as directed); Rule 7(a)(5) (engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); Rule 7(a)(7) (willfully\r\n  violate a valid court order issued by a court of this state or of another\r\n  jurisdiction); and Rule 7(a)(10) (willfully fail to comply with a final\r\n  decision of the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board).Â  \r\nDue to the quantity and nature of Respondent's\r\n  misconduct, the Hearing Panel recommended that Respondent:Â  (1) be disbarred;\r\n  (2) be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings, attend the Legal Ethics and\r\n  Practice Program and Trust Account school, and pay the fee dispute award prior\r\n  to petitioning for reinstatement; (3) pay a fine in an appropriate amount; and\r\n  (4) comply with such other directives as this Court deems appropriate.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.&nbsp; Standard of Review\r\nThis Court has the sole\r\n  authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the appropriate sanction after\r\n  a thorough review of the record.Â  In re Welch, 355 S.C. 93, 96, 584\r\n  S.E.2d 369, 370 (2003).Â  &quot;The Court is not bound by the panel's\r\n  recommendation and may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law.&quot;&nbsp; In re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102,\r\n  106&nbsp;(2008).Â  &quot;Although this Court is not bound by the findings of the\r\n  Panel and Committee, these findings are entitled to great weight, particularly\r\n  when the inferences to be drawn from the testimony depend on the credibility of\r\n  the witnesses.&quot;Â  In re Marshall, 331 S.C. 514, 519, 498 S.E.2d 869,\r\n  871 (1998).\r\n&quot;A disciplinary\r\n  violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;&nbsp; In re\r\n    Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see also Rule\r\n  8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall be\r\n  established by clear and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the\r\n  charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.&quot;).Â  &quot;Clear and\r\n  convincing evidence is that degree of proof which will produce in the mind of\r\n  the trier of facts a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be\r\n  established.&quot;Â  Peeler v. Spartan Radiocasting, Inc., 324 S.C. 261,\r\n  265 n.4, 478 S.E.2d 282, 284 n.4 (1996) (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Such measure\r\n  of proof is intermediate, more than a mere preponderance but less that is\r\n  required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt; it does not mean clear and\r\n  unequivocal.&quot; Â Id.\r\nB. Propriety of the State Court\r\n  System and Disciplinary Proceedings \r\nAlthough Respondent raises\r\n  seven separate exceptions, his primary contention is that the Panel Report is\r\n  invalid or void due to procedural and substantive deficiencies. Specifically,\r\n  Respondent challenges:Â  (1) the propriety of the state court system as well as\r\n  the disciplinary proceedings, and (2) the level of proof supporting the\r\n  findings of misconduct.Â  Thus, in the interest of clarity and logical\r\n  progression, we have addressed Respondent's exceptions under these two headings\r\n  and out of the order presented in his brief.\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nIn challenging the propriety\r\n  of the state court system, Respondent claims he offered evidence that the\r\n  allegations of misconduct were precipitated by irregularities and corruption within\r\n  the state court system.Â  As to the disciplinary proceedings, Respondent directs\r\n  this Court's attention to the following:Â  (1) the ODC's four-year delay in\r\n  filing formal charges after Respondent's Interim Suspension; (2) the Hearing\r\n  Panel's failure to grant Respondent's request for additional discovery time;\r\n  (3) the appointment and conduct of Robert Bogan as the Special Prosecutor;[9] (4) the conduct of the panel hearing, which included the Hearing Panel's\r\n  decision to quash Respondent's subpoenas of key witnesses and to question\r\n  witnesses; and (5) the Hearing Panel's delay in filing the Panel Report. \r\nBased on these claimed\r\n  procedural irregularities, Respondent asserts that the entire disciplinary\r\n  proceeding violated his procedural and substantive rights to due process in the\r\n  suspension of his license to practice law in this state.Â  \r\nAs a threshold matter, we\r\n  note that Respondent for the first time on appeal challenges the appointment of\r\n  Robert Bogan as a Special Prosecutor[10] and the Panel's method of questioning witnesses during the hearing.[11]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find these arguments are not properly before this Court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the\r\n  first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  judge to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;).Â  \r\nIn view of the foregoing, our\r\n  analysis turns to assessing the merits of Respondent's remaining claims that\r\n  involve the limitation of time allotted for discovery, the quashing of Respondent's\r\n  subpoenas for key witnesses, and the timeliness of the filing of the Panel\r\n  Report.\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nRespondent contends the\r\n  Hearing Panel improperly refused to extend the time period for discovery.Â \r\n  Specifically, Respondent submits that &quot;the time period for the completion\r\n  of discovery is so limited in terms of sixty days that the hearing and discovery\r\n  process in this action was completely prejudicial to the Respondent and\r\n  tantamount to an unconstitutional application of the law.&quot;Â  \r\nAs we interpret Respondent's\r\n  argument, he essentially challenges the Hearing Panel's denial of his motion\r\n  for additional time to complete discovery, which was incorporated into\r\n  Respondent's Answer to the Formal Charges and clarified in a subsequent motion\r\n  in which Respondent requested 480 days of discovery (sixty days for each of the\r\n  eight misconduct allegations).Â  \r\nInitially, we note the\r\n  chairman was authorized to deny Respondent's motion pursuant to Rule 14(b)(1)\r\n  of the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.[12] Â Furthermore, we find that Respondent was not prejudiced by this decision.Â \r\n  Respondent's request for a 480-day period of discovery was clearly excessive\r\n  and not contemplated by Rule 14 as the time for discovery is sixty days[13] with the possibility of a thirty-day extension.Â  Respondent was also afforded a\r\n  significant amount of time for discovery as he was served with the formal\r\n  charges on March 10, 2009, discovery was extended until July 29, 2009, and a\r\n  pre-hearing conference was held on January 4, 2010, at which time Respondent's\r\n  motion was denied.[14]\r\nAt the pre-hearing\r\n  conference, the panel chair granted Respondent additional time to issue\r\n  subpoenas for documents.Â  Significantly, Respondent waited until eight days\r\n  before the panel hearing to issue subpoenas. Â Taking into consideration this\r\n  procedural history, we find Respondent cannot establish that he was prejudiced\r\n  by the denial of his motion for additional time for discovery.\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nIn a related argument,\r\n  Respondent contends the Hearing Panel committed error in quashing the subpoenas\r\n  he issued for the Honorable Paul M. Burch and the Honorable Jean Hoefer Toal to\r\n  produce certain documents and to appear at the panel hearing.[15]\r\nIn quashing the subpoenas,\r\n  the Hearing Panel relied on Rule 45 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure, which sets forth the requirements for the form, issuance, and\r\n  service of subpoenas.Â  Based on the provisions of Rule 45, the Hearing Panel\r\n  found the subpoenas were not timely served and Respondent failed to comply with\r\n  requirements of witness fees and mileage expenses as to Judge Burch.Â \r\n  Additionally, the Hearing Panel found Respondent had failed to demonstrate that\r\n  the testimony was critical to his case or that it could not be obtained by\r\n  other means.\r\nRespondent asserts that the\r\n  provisions of Rule 45 were inapplicable to the disciplinary proceedings.Â \r\n  Instead, he contends that Rule 15 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement[16] is the governing rule as it specifically applies to subpoenas in disciplinary\r\n  proceedings.\r\nWe find the Hearing Panel\r\n  correctly quashed the subpoenas based on Respondent's failure to comply with\r\n  the provisions of Rule 45, SCRCP.Â  Rule 15 authorizes an accused lawyer to request\r\n  the subpoena of witnesses and documents during the discovery period.Â  Â Notably,\r\n  Rule 15 does not include any procedural requirements regarding these\r\n  subpoenas.Â  Rule 9 of the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, however, incorporates\r\n  the Rules of Civil Procedure in disciplinary proceedings, stating\r\n  &quot;[e]xcept as otherwise provided in these rules . . . the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure apply in lawyer discipline cases . . . when formal\r\n  charges have been filed.&quot;Â  Rule 9, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nRespondent clearly did not\r\n  comply with the provisions of Rule 45 as the service of the subpoenas on Judge\r\n  Burch and Chief Justice Toal was untimely.Â  Furthermore, Respondent has never\r\n  articulated how the testimony of Chief Justice Toal was necessary to his case.Â \r\n  Although it is a closer question whether Judge Burch could have been a material\r\n  witness as he was involved in certain allegations of misconduct, we conclude\r\n  that his failure to testify did not prejudice Respondent given all of the\r\n  documentary evidence related to these misconduct allegations was offered into\r\n  evidence.\r\nc.\r\nAs to the timeliness of the Panel\r\n  Report, we find the Hearing Panel filed its Panel Report in accordance with the\r\n  applicable rules of procedure.Â  As Respondent correctly notes, Rule 26(d) of\r\n  the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement requires the Hearing Panel to submit\r\n  the record and its report to the Supreme Court within sixty days after the\r\n  filing of the transcript of a hearing.Â  This time period, however, may be\r\n  extended by the chair of the Commission pursuant to Rule 14(b)(1) of the Rules for\r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. Â This rule further authorizes the chair to\r\n  grant extensions beyond thirty days if &quot;good cause&quot; is shown. \r\nDespite these provisions,\r\n  Respondent contends that an extension beyond six months required the permission\r\n  of this Court.Â  Pursuant to Rule 14, the chair was the proper authority to\r\n  grant the extension as Rule 14(b)(4) states, &quot;[e]xcept for those periods\r\n  of time that may be extended by the Commission under (1) above, the Supreme\r\n  Court . . . may grant an extension of time to perform any act required by these\r\n  Rules.&quot;Â  Rule 14(b)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR; see In re Crews,\r\n  389 S.C. 322, 336, 698 S.E.2d 785, 792 (2010) (recognizing that Rule 14(b)(1)\r\n  grants the chair of the Commission &quot;broad powers to extend or shorten time\r\n  periods in disciplinary hearings&quot;).Â  Furthermore, this Court implicitly\r\n  granted the Hearing Panel's request for an extension as we issued an order on July\r\n  30, 2010, denying Respondent's motion to dismiss with prejudice due to the\r\n  untimeliness of the filing of the Panel Report.Â  Finally, any delay in the\r\n  filing of the Panel Report has been taken into consideration by this Court as a\r\n  factor in mitigation; thus, we can discern no prejudice to Respondent.\r\nd.\r\nRespondent claims the\r\n  above-outlined procedural irregularities and Panel decisions culminated in a\r\n  denial of his &quot;right to due process in the suspension of his license to\r\n  practice law in this State for over 5 years.&quot;Â  \r\n&quot;When the State seeks to\r\n  revoke a professional license, procedural due process rights must be\r\n  met.&quot;Â  Zaman v. S.C. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 305 S.C. 281, 284,\r\n  408 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991).Â  However, &quot;[o]ne cannot complain of a due\r\n  process violation if he has recourse to a constitutionally sufficient\r\n  administrative procedure but merely declines or fails to take advantage of\r\n  it.&quot;Â  Id. at 285, 408 S.E.2d at 215.\r\nWe find that Respondent's\r\n  rights to due process were not violated by the disciplinary proceedings.Â  Initially,\r\n  we note that this Court was authorized to place Respondent on Interim\r\n  Suspension based on the ODC's petition involving the Medical Record Matter.[17] Â In turn, the ODC properly served Respondent with the formal charges.Â \r\n  Respondent was then given an opportunity to retain counsel, answer the charges,\r\n  and engage in discovery.Â  During the panel hearing, the Panel allowed\r\n  Respondent to cross-examine the ODC's witnesses and challenge its evidence. Additionally,\r\n  Respondent presented his own evidence in his defense of the misconduct\r\n  allegations.Â  Although there was delay in the filing of the Panel Report, the\r\n  Respondent has been given an opportunity to challenge it before this Court\r\n  through briefs and oral arguments.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we\r\n  conclude there was no due process violation as Respondent was provided notice,\r\n  an opportunity to be heard, and judicial review.Â  See In re Vora,\r\n  354 S.C. 590, 595, 582 S.E.2d 413, 416 (2003) (&quot;Procedural\r\n  due process requirements are not technical; no particular form of procedure is\r\n  necessary. The United States Supreme Court has held, however, that at a minimum\r\n  certain elements must be present. Â These include (1) adequate notice; (2)\r\n  adequate opportunity for a hearing; (3) the right to introduce evidence; and\r\n  (4) the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.&quot; (citation\r\n  omitted));Kurschner v. City of Camden Planning Comm'n, 376 S.C.\r\n  165, 171, 656 S.E.2d 346, 350 (2008) (stating &quot;[t]he\r\n  fundamental requirements of due process include notice, an\r\n    opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way, and judicial review&quot;).\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nRespondent contends the\r\n  findings of the Hearing Panel are without evidentiary support because the ODC\r\n  did not satisfy its burden to prove the allegations by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence.Â  In support of this contention, Respondent avers that the Hearing\r\n  Panel &quot;merely accept[ed] as true the claims of misconduct by the ODC,&quot;\r\n  which were primarily based on circuit court orders that were challenged by\r\n  Respondent.Â  Essentially, Respondent asserts that the ODC did not present any\r\n  independent evidence to substantiate the allegations of misconduct.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Respondent argues the Hearing Panel failed to consider and include all of the\r\n  mitigating factors in favor of Respondent. \r\nAlthough we give some\r\n  credence to Respondent's claims concerning procedural irregularities in the\r\n  state court system and the disciplinary proceedings, we find that these deficiencies\r\n  do not warrant the invalidation of the Panel Report.Â  However, we agree in part\r\n  with Respondent's arguments as we find the ODC only proved three of the eight\r\n  allegations of misconduct by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Specifically, as\r\n  will be discussed, we find the ODC presented clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  Respondent committed misconduct with respect to the following:Â  the Medical\r\n  Record Matter, the Fee Dispute Matter, and the Samuel Matter.\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nDeferring to the credibility\r\n  determinations of the Hearing Panel, we find there is clear and convincing\r\n  evidence that Respondent committed misconduct in creating the document that\r\n  appeared to be a medical record.\r\nFacially, the document is\r\n  formatted similar to that of the Byerly Hospital report and even includes the\r\n  client's vital signs, thus, giving it the appearance of a medical record.Â \r\n  Respondent included the document in the settlement package to the Unisun claims\r\n  representative and to Orr without alerting them to the fact that the document\r\n  was not a medical record.\r\nAlthough it is disputable\r\n  whether the defense attorneys in the 1998 automobile accident case relied on\r\n  this document in reaching their settlement agreements, it is evident that\r\n  Respondent created the document with the intention of establishing that the\r\n  client's heart condition was caused by the 1995 automobile accident.Â  Given\r\n  that there were no medical records in evidence to support this causal relation,\r\n  we agree with the Panel's conclusion that Respondent's creation of this document\r\n  constituted misconduct.[18]Â  See In re Pennington, 380 S.C. 49, 668 S.E.2d 402 (2008)\r\n  (imposing definite suspension of two years where attorney committed several\r\n  acts of misconduct, which included the submission of false documents to ODC); In\r\n    re Lathan, 360 S.C. 326, 600 S.E.2d 902 (2004) (finding definite suspension\r\n  of six months, retroactive to Interim Suspension, was warranted where attorney\r\n  committed misconduct arising out of false HUD-1 Settlement Statements); In\r\n    re Belding, 356 S.C. 319, 325, 589 S.E.2d 197, 200 (2003) (concluding\r\n  one-year suspension was appropriate where attorney drafted false documents and\r\n  &quot;made a conscious effort to make the documents appear authentic&quot;).\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nWe find there is clear and\r\n  convincing evidence to support a finding of misconduct as to the Fee Dispute\r\n  Matter.Â  \r\nOn September 9, 2002, the\r\n  South Carolina Bar Fee Disputes Resolution Board (Board) notified Respondent of\r\n  its final decision that Wright was entitled to a fee refund in the amount of\r\n  $1,750.Â  Respondent, however, continues to dispute the validity of this award\r\n  based on irregularities in the fee dispute proceedings.Â  Essentially,\r\n  Respondent claims that he did not have to respond to the fee dispute\r\n  investigation as he believed the client had filed a separate complaint with the\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel.Â  Furthermore, he asserts that the Chairman of\r\n  the Board had a conflict and, thus, should have been disqualified in the\r\n  proceedings.\r\nAlthough there may be some\r\n  merit to Respondent's assertions, they are of no consequence at this stage in\r\n  the proceedings since Respondent had the opportunity to raise these issues in\r\n  circuit court.Â  He failed to file a brief and failed to appear at the hearing, thus,\r\n  effectively waiving any challenge to the finality of the fee award.Â  Moreover,\r\n  despite clear language in the Rules, which instruct that the circuit court was\r\n  the final appellate level, Respondent proceeded to appeal the decision to the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â  Even after the Court of Appeals dismissed his appeal and\r\n  this Court denied Respondent's petition for a writ of certiorari in 2007,\r\n  Respondent still has not tendered the fee award to his client and, thus, has\r\n  willfully failed to comply with a final decision of the Board. \r\nAccordingly, we agree with\r\n  the Hearing Panel's finding of misconduct as to this allegation.Â  See In\r\n    re Danielson, 391 S.C. 386, 706 S.E.2d 1 (2011) (imposing two-year\r\n  suspension where lawyer committed numerous acts of misconduct, including failure\r\n  to comply with a Final Decision of the Board); In re Thomson, 389 S.C.\r\n  24, 698 S.E.2d 625 (2010) (issuing public reprimand where lawyer failed to pay\r\n  fee that was ordered by the Board).\r\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nOf the three findings of\r\n  misconduct based on Respondent's failure to prosecute, we find only the Samuel\r\n  Matter was proven by clear and convincing evidence.\r\nApproximately one year after\r\n  filing the medical malpractice lawsuit, the circuit court granted summary judgment\r\n  to the defendants due to Respondent's failure to provide potential experts and\r\n  their affidavits.Â  The court also dismissed the case due to Respondent's\r\n  failure to appear at scheduled hearings and his request for a continuance in\r\n  violation of a court order.Â  Once summary judgment was granted any other reason\r\n  for dismissal was superfluous.Â  Moreover, a litigant cannot be barred from\r\n  requesting a continuance.Â  A judge only has the option to grant or deny it.Â  \r\nThe granting of summary\r\n  judgment in a medical malpractice case for failure to produce an expert witness\r\n  is not unusual and would not normally result in disciplinary action for failure\r\n  to prosecute the case.Â  However, Respondent never informed Samuel of the reason\r\n  for the dismissal, but only communicated that the case was on appeal.Â \r\n  Respondent also failed to maintain contact with Samuel and never informed her\r\n  that the Court of Appeals had affirmed the circuit court's order, this Court\r\n  had denied the petition for a writ of certiorari, or that he had been placed on\r\n  Interim Suspension.Â  In fact, Samuel testified that she was apprised of the\r\n  status of her case two weeks before the panel hearing when she talked with\r\n  Bogan about her testimony.\r\nAccordingly, we find there is\r\n  clear and convincing evidence that Respondent committed misconduct with respect\r\n  to the Samuel Matter.Â  See In re Longtin, 393 S.C. 368, 713\r\n  S.E.2d 297 (2011) (concluding nine-month suspension was warranted, in part, by\r\n  lawyer's failure to prosecute cases adequately on\r\n  behalf of his clients, to follow orders of the court, and to respond to his\r\n  clients); In re Moore, 329 S.C. 294, 494 S.E.2d 804 (1997)\r\n  (finding definite suspension of one year was appropriate, in part, where lawyer's\r\n  neglect resulted in dismissal of client's case for lack of prosecution); In\r\n    re Baldwin, 278 S.C. 292, 294 S.E.2d 790 (1982) (concluding indefinite\r\n  suspension was warranted where lawyer failed to appear at scheduled court\r\n  hearings).\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nFinally, Respondent contends\r\n  the Hearing Panel failed to consider and include in its report all of the\r\n  mitigating factors in favor of Respondent.Â  We find this contention to be\r\n  without merit as Respondent has presented the additional mitigating factors in\r\n  his brief to this Court.Â  In reaching our decision, we have considered all mitigating\r\n  factors that Respondent deems significant.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion\r\nBased on the three proven\r\n  incidents of misconduct and the mitigating and aggravating factors, we conclude\r\n  the following sanctions are appropriate:Â  a definite suspension from the\r\n  practice of law for two years, which shall run retroactively to the date of\r\n  Respondent's Interim Suspension; payment of the costs of these proceedings in\r\n  an amount of $8,073.99; and payment of $1,750, the fee dispute amount awarded\r\n  to Wright.Â  Prior to petitioning for reinstatement, Respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with the\r\n  sanctions imposed by this Court.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In re Dickey, 366 S.C. 18, 620 S.E.2d 332\r\n  (2005).Â  The length of time between Respondent's Interim Suspension and the\r\n  filing of the formal charges gives this Court cause for concern.\r\n[2]Â  The document, which did not include a\r\n  medical-facility letterhead or reference a physician, was similar in appearance\r\n  to the Byerly Hospital medical record dated July 31, 1996 and provided in\r\n  pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  HISTORY:Â \r\n    Moderately obese female with a recent history of headaches and exertional\r\n      chest discomforts following MVA on 5/3/95.Â  She developed problems with\r\n    headaches, confusion, memory loss, and chest discomforts which she\r\n    thought was indigestion soon after the MVA.Â  This had been ongoing for\r\n    several months and increasing in frequency while at work.\r\n\r\nIMPRESSION:Â \r\n  Portable chest, but no obvious acute abnormality is identified.Â  Patient has a history\r\n    of acute MI following the accident.Â  (Emphasis added.)\r\n[3]Â  We note that this Court appointed an attorney to\r\n  protect the interests of Respondent's South Carolina clients during\r\n  Respondent's Interim Suspension, which began on September 27, 2005.Â  This\r\n  attorney was relieved on June 5, 2008.\r\n[4] Â Respondent, in his individual capacity, appealed\r\n  both orders to the Court of Appeals.Â  The court affirmed both orders, finding\r\n  that only a duly appointed personal representative could initiate a wrongful\r\n  death action on behalf of the Estate, and a licensed attorney must represent\r\n  the Estate in court.Â  Because Respondent appealed the circuit court's decisions\r\n  only in his individual capacity, the court held that Respondent could not\r\n  maintain the appeals.

App. filed Feb. 5, 2001).\r\n[7]Â  The Clerk testified he really did not recall the\r\n  events of March 7, 2001, but that he was testifying from notes provided by\r\n  Investigator Huffstetler.\r\n[8] Â With respect to the Darlington/Florence County\r\n  Matter, the Hearing Panel concluded that Disciplinary Counsel did not prove by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence that Respondent was dishonest with Judge Floyd as\r\n  to whether his Florence County case had been continued.\r\n[9] Â By order dated October 5, 2009, this Court appointed\r\n  Robert Bogan as Special Prosecutor in this matter.Â  Bogan, who was no longer\r\n  employed with the South Carolina Attorney General's Office at the time of the\r\n  hearing, handled the investigation of the complaints against Respondent.\r\n[10]Â  Even if properly preserved, we find this contention\r\n  to be without merit.Â  First, Respondent was apprised of the request and\r\n  expressed no objection to the order in which this Court appointed the Special\r\n  Prosecutor.Â Â  Secondly, any assertion that Bogan engaged in the unauthorized\r\n  practice of law by prosecuting Respondent's case while employed at another\r\n  state agency is not supported by the Appellate Court Rule cited by Respondent.Â \r\n  Rule 506, SCACR, which deals with the Code of Conduct for Staff Attorneys and\r\n  Law Clerks, is not applicable to Bogan because he was not a staff attorney.\r\n[11] Â As to Respondent's claim regarding the Hearing\r\n  Panel's calling witnesses out of order and questioning witnesses, we note that\r\n  Respondent specifically agreed to the procedure employed by the Hearing Panel\r\n  and was also given the opportunity to call witnesses out of order.Â \r\n  Furthermore, even if we construe the procedure as improper, we find Respondent\r\n  was not prejudiced as he was given an unlimited opportunity to question the\r\n  witnesses and adequately present his case.\r\n[12]Â  Rule 14(b)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n[13]Â  Rule 25(f), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n[14] On November 13, 2009, the Administrative Chairman of\r\n  the Hearing Panel conducted a hearing for &quot;the purpose of addressing\r\n  Respondent's motion for additional time to conduct discovery and any other\r\n  outstanding discovery issues.&quot;Â  Despite being notified of this proceeding,\r\n  Respondent failed to appear.Â  Due to Respondent's absence, the Chairman\r\n  declined to rule on the motion.\r\n[15]Â  Respondent served subpoenas to:Â  (1) Judge Burch on\r\n  January 22, 2010, and March 10, 2010; and (2) Chief Justice Toal on January 25,\r\n  2010, and March 10, 2010.\r\n[16]Â  Rule 15, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n[17] See Rule 17(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR\r\n  (&quot;Upon receipt of sufficient evidence demonstrating that a lawyer poses a\r\n  substantial threat of serious harm to the public or to the administration of\r\n  justice, the Supreme Court may suspend the lawyer or transfer the lawyer to\r\n  incapacity inactive status pending a final determination in any proceeding\r\n  under these rules.&quot;).\r\n[18]Â  During oral argument before this Court, Respondent\r\n  referenced the record of Dr. Dean Banks, a chiropractor, in support of his\r\n  position.Â  In our review of the medical records in evidence, we carefully\r\n  considered this particular document.Â  We, however, found that this document\r\n  does not relate the client's heart condition to the 1995 automobile accident.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27067","title":"In the Matter of Ivan N.

Â In\r\n  accordance with Rule 29(b), RLDE, the Clerk of Court provided ODC and petitioner/respondent\r\n  with thirty (30) days in which to inform the Court of any reason why the\r\n  imposition of identical discipline in this State was not warranted.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nPetitioner/respondent submitted a document entitled\r\n  &quot;Claim of Petitioner&quot; maintaining that, because he was considering\r\n  filing an appeal from the Order of Disbarment, his notice to ODC of the Order\r\n  of Disbarment was timely within the meaning of Rule 29(a), RLDE.Â  He further\r\n  asserted the misconduct which formed the basis for his North Carolina disbarment\r\n  was &quot;basically&quot; considered by the Court in its order imposing the\r\n  twelve (12) month suspension from the practice of law and, therefore, the\r\n  imposition of reciprocal discipline for the same misconduct would result in\r\n  grave injustice.Â  Alternatively, petitioner/respondent claimed that, if the\r\n  Court concluded the imposition of reciprocal discipline was appropriate, it\r\n  would be inequitable for this Court to disbar him for the misconduct found by\r\n  the North Carolina State Bar because the Court has imposed lesser sanctions for\r\n  similar misconduct.\r\nAfter oral argument, the Court granted petitioner/respondent's\r\n  request to brief the issues raised by this matter.Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nReciprocal Discipline\r\nRule 29(d), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, provides\r\n  that the Court shall impose the identical discipline imposed in another\r\n  jurisdiction unless the lawyer or ODC demonstrate or the Court finds that it\r\n  clearly appears upon the face of the record from which the discipline is\r\n  predicated that the identical discipline is improper for one of four stated\r\n  reasons:\r\n\r\n  1) the procedure was\r\n    so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation\r\n    of due process; \r\n  2) there was such\r\n    infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear\r\n    conviction that the Supreme Court could not, consistent with its duty, accept\r\n    as final the conclusion on that subject; \r\n  3) imposition of the\r\n    same discipline by the Court would result in grave injustice; and \r\n  4) the established\r\n    misconduct warrants substantially different discipline in this state.\r\n\r\nIf the Supreme Court determines that any of\r\n  the above elements exist, it shall enter such other order as it deems\r\n  appropriate. Â The burden is on the party seeking different discipline in this\r\n  jurisdiction to demonstrate that the imposition of the same discipline is not\r\n  appropriate.Â  Rule 29(d), RDLE.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timeliness of Notice of Disbarment \r\nPetitioner/respondent asserts he promptly notified ODC of\r\n  his disbarment by the North Carolina State Bar by informing Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel of the discipline immediately before his October 21, 2010,\r\n  reinstatement hearing.Â  He states that he received service of the September 9,\r\n  2010, Order of Disbarment on September 20, 2010, and contemplated filing an\r\n  appeal.Â  According to petitioner/respondent, under the North Carolina Rules of\r\n  Appellate Procedure, he had until October 20, 2010, to assert his appellate\r\n  rights and, until that date, the Order of Disbarment was not final and, therefore,\r\n  his notice to ODC on October 21, 2010, was timely.Â  Â Â \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 29(a), RLDE, states, in part, as\r\n  follows:\r\nUpon being disciplined â€¦in another\r\n  jurisdiction, a lawyer admitted to practice in this state shall promptly inform\r\n  disciplinary counsel of the discipline...\r\nPetitioner/respondent did not promptly inform ODC of the\r\n  September 9, 2010, Order of Disbarment.Â  Rule 29(a), RLDE, does not permit a\r\n  lawyer who has been disciplined in another jurisdiction to delay informing ODC\r\n  of discipline while the lawyer contemplates the filing of an appeal or until\r\n  such time as the disciplinary order becomes final in the other jurisdiction.Â  Petitioner/respondent's\r\n  notice to ODC on October 21, 2010, more than one month after he received the\r\n  North Carolina Order of Disbarment, did not comply with Rule 29(a), RLDE.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same Misconduct\r\nPetitioner/respondent argues the Court should not impose\r\n  reciprocal discipline because the misconduct for which he was disbarred in North\r\n  Carolina is the same misconduct for which he was suspended from the practice of\r\n  law in South Carolina.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Court's order imposing discipline on petitioner/respondent\r\n  addressed two matters of misconduct.Â  The first matter was petitioner/respondent's\r\n  felony conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. Â§ 4, entitled &quot;misprision of\r\n  felony.&quot;Â  The opinion states that petitioner/respondent pled guilty to\r\n  misprision of felony, admitting that, although he had knowledge of the actual\r\n  commission of bank fraud from April 2003 through October 2004, he concealed the\r\n  information by failing to inform a judge or other person in authority of the\r\n  felony.Â  In the Matter of Walters, supra.Â  \r\nThe second matter involved petitioner/respondent's\r\n  completion of a series of closings on the same piece of property.Â  At the time\r\n  of the last closing for Mr. and Mrs. Doe, petitioner/respondent did not satisfy\r\n  the mortgage from the closing proceeds and did not insure that a release was\r\n  executed and filed.Â  In a previous closing on the same property, petitioner/respondent\r\n  failed to insure the proper release and/or satisfactions were filed by the\r\n  lender.Â  Id.\r\nIn addition to addressing petitioner/respondent's misprision\r\n  of felony conviction, the North Carolina Order of Discipline discussed petitioner/respondent's\r\n  misconduct as the closing attorney for more than twenty real estate\r\n  transactions involving Kyle Wimmer.[3]Â \r\n  The Order of Discipline reports that, in numerous instances involving the sale\r\n  of property to and from Wimmer or his affiliate business(es), petitioner/respondent\r\n  knowingly made false statements on HUD-1 Settlement Statements for the purpose\r\n  of influencing the action of the lending institution whose accounts were\r\n  insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n  Â§ 1014.Â  The false statements allowed Wimmer, in some of the instances, to\r\n  &quot;flip&quot; the loans and/or properties.Â  In addition, on several\r\n  occasions, petitioner/respondent disbursed funds from the lending institution in\r\n  a manner which was inconsistent with the disbursement listed on the HUD-1\r\n  Settlement Statements provided to the institution.Â  None of the reported\r\n  instances of misconduct involved Mr. and Mrs. Doe.Â  \r\nNeither petitioner/respondent's knowingly false statements\r\n  on numerous HUD-1 Settlement Statements nor his improper disbursements were\r\n  considered by the Court in its order suspending petitioner/respondent from the\r\n  practice of law.Â  Consequently, it is appropriate for the Court to consider the\r\n  imposition of reciprocal discipline for the misconduct which was not previously\r\n  addressed by the Court.[4]Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Â Infirmity of Proof \r\nPetitioner/respondent argues that, if the Court determines\r\n  the North Carolina Order of Disbarment addresses misconduct not previously\r\n  considered by the Court, the Court should refuse to impose reciprocal\r\n  discipline for the additional misconduct because of the infirmity of proof of the\r\n  misconduct.Â  He states he chose not to file an answer to the disciplinary\r\n  complaint in North Carolina even though all the allegations were untrue because\r\n  he would still have been subject to discipline in North Carolina as a result of\r\n  his conviction for misprision of felony.Â  Petitioner/respondent further asserts\r\n  he feared that, if he challenged the North Carolina complaint, South Carolina\r\n  would assume he did not recognize the wrongfulness and seriousness of the misconduct\r\n  which would negatively impact his Petition for Reinstatement.[5]Â \r\n  As a result, petitioner/respondent asserts the Court should not accept the\r\n  unchallenged findings reported in the Order of Disbarment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder the North Carolina State Bar's Discipline and\r\n  Disability Rules, if a lawyer fails to file an answer to a complaint, the\r\n  allegations contained in the complaint will be deemed admitted.Â  27 N.C. Admin\r\n  Code Chapter 1, Subchapter B Â§ 0114(f).Â  Since petitioner/respondent chose not\r\n  to file an answer, he knowingly admitted the allegations in the North Carolina\r\n  complaint and, therefore, is precluded from challenging them in the current\r\n  proceeding.Â  \r\nFurther, petitioner/respondent was entitled to challenge the\r\n  allegations of misconduct in North Carolina.Â  The Court would not have not looked\r\n  negatively upon petitioner/respondent's assertion of his rights in that\r\n  disciplinary proceeding.Â  \r\nIV. Imposition of Same Discipline Would Result in Grave Injustice and\r\n  Warrants Substantially Different Discipline \r\nPetitioner/respondent argues that, if the Court concludes\r\n  the imposition of reciprocal discipline is appropriate, it would be inequitable\r\n  for this Court to disbar him for the misconduct found by the North Carolina\r\n  State Bar because the Court has imposed lesser sanctions for similar misconduct.Â \r\n  Petitioner/respondent claims that, at most, a sanction of twelve months,\r\n  retroactive to the date of his twelve month suspension imposed on September 28,\r\n  2009, or an eight month suspension retroactive to September 9, 2010, the date\r\n  of the North Carolina Order of Disbarment, should be imposed.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn each of the cases cited by petitioner/respondent the\r\n  disciplined lawyer was unaware that his misconduct assisted in the perpetuation\r\n  of a criminal or fraudulent scheme committed by others.Â  As noted in the Order\r\n  of Disbarment, petitioner/respondent knowingly made false statements on HUD-1\r\n  Settlement Statements for the purpose of influencing the action of the lending\r\n  institution.Â  Further, petitioner/respondent pled guilty to misprision of\r\n  felony, admitting that he knew of the actual commission of bank fraud from\r\n  April 2003 through October 2004, but concealed the information by failing to\r\n  inform a judge or other person in authority of the felony.Â  We find disbarment\r\n  is the appropriate sanction.Â  \r\nPetition for\r\n  Reinstatement\r\nSince we disbar\r\n  petitioner/respondent from the practice of law pursuant to the reciprocal\r\n  disciplinary provisions of Rule 29, RLDE, we deny his Petition for\r\n  Reinstatement.Â  Further, the Court is extremely troubled by\r\n  petitioner/respondent's failure to inform the Committee that he had been\r\n  disbarred by the North Carolina State Bar on September 9, 2010, one month\r\n  before the hearing on his Petition for Reinstatement.Â  While we recognize Rule\r\n  33, RLDE, did not specifically require petitioner/respondent to inform the\r\n  Committee of the North Carolina Order of Discipline,[6] petitioner/respondent affirmatively\r\n  stated to the Committee &quot;I haven't had any prior disciplinary orders\r\n  except for this one [the Court's order suspending him from the practice of law\r\n  in South Carolina].&quot; Â This was patently untrue. Â Further, although he responded\r\n  to numerous questions posed by the Committee about the bank fraud underlying\r\n  his misprision of felony conviction, petitioner/respondent never advised the\r\n  Committee that he had been disbarred in North Carolina as a result of his\r\n  complicity in the bank fraud.Â  Petitioner/respondent's statement and omission\r\n  indicate a lack of honesty, candor, and integrity which, alone, constitute a\r\n  basis for denying his Petition for Reinstatement.Â  See Rule 33(f)(6),\r\n  RLDE (in order to be reinstated, lawyer must possess requisite honesty and\r\n  integrity to practice law). Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter thorough review of the record, we deny the Petition\r\n  for Reinstatement.Â  Further, we hereby disbar respondent from the practice of\r\n  law in this State pursuant to the reciprocal discipline provisions of Rule 29,\r\n  RLDE.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file\r\n  an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to\r\n  the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    NORTH CAROLINA\r\n      WAKE COUNTY\r\n    BEFORE THE\r\n      DISCIPLINARY HEARING COMMISSION\r\n      OF THE\r\n      NORTH CAROLINA STATE BAR\r\n      09 DHC 3\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE BAR,\r\n      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n        Plaintiff\r\n      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  v.\r\n      IVAN N.

Michael Booe, Chair, and members Robert F.\r\n  Siler and Karen B. Ray.Â  Brian P.D. Oten and Carmen Hoyme Bannon represent\r\n  Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar.Â  Defendant, Ivan N. Walters, filed a\r\n  document with the DHC indicating that he did not intend to participate in this\r\n  matter and no counsel of record has appeared on his behalf.Â  \r\nOn Plaintiffâ€™s motion, judgment by default was entered\r\n  against Defendant.Â  Based upon the pleadings and admissions pursuant to 27 N.C.\r\n  Admin. Code Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Â§ .0114(f) and Rule 8(d) of the Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure, the hearing panel hereby finds by clear, cogent, and\r\n  convincing evidence the following\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n1.&nbsp; Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Bar (â€œState Barâ€), is a body duly\r\n  organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to bring\r\n  this proceeding under the authority granted it in Chapter 84 of the General\r\n  Statutes of North Carolina, and the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina\r\n  State Bar (Chapter 1 of Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code).\r\n2.&nbsp; Defendant, Ivan N. Walters (hereafter â€œDefendantâ€ or â€œWaltersâ€), was\r\n  admitted to the North Carolina State Bar in 1993 and is, and was at all times\r\n  referred to herein, an Attorney at Law licensed to practice in North Carolina,\r\n  subject to the rules, regulations, and Rules of Professional Conduct of the\r\n  North Carolina State Bar and the laws of the State of North Carolina.\r\n3. Defendant was properly served with process in this action.\r\n4. Walters is also licensed to practice law in South Carolina.Â  During all\r\n  or part of the relevant periods referred to herein, Walters was engaged in the\r\n  practice of law in the State of South Carolina and maintained a law office in Rock Hill,   York County, South Carolina.\r\n5.&nbsp;From 2003 through 2005, Walters served as closing attorney in multiple\r\n  real estate transactions involving Kyle Edward Wimmer, who was later convicted\r\n  of bank fraud and money laundering in connection with a real estate investment\r\n  scheme.\r\n6.&nbsp;During this period, Wimmer was the sole managing member, operator, and\r\n  registered agent of Real Estate Investment Capital, Inc. (â€œREICâ€), a South Carolina corporation.Â  Wimmer also owned and operated an entity called Landmark\r\n  Remodeling. \r\n7. Branch Banking and Trust (BB&amp;T) was the mortgage lender in all of\r\n  the real estate transactions described herein for which Walters served as\r\n  closing attorney.Â  BB&amp;Tâ€™s accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit\r\n  Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a federal agency.\r\n8.&nbsp; It is a violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1014 to knowingly make a false\r\n  statement upon any application for the purpose of influencing in any way the\r\n  action of any institution the accounts of which are insured by the FDIC.Â  \r\n9.&nbsp; In 2003, Vicky and Charles Snyder (â€œthe Snydersâ€) were the sole owners\r\n  of Snyder Enterprises, Inc., a company that invested in rental properties.Â  In\r\n  or about July 2003, the Snyders agreed to sell seven of Snyder Enterprisesâ€™\r\n  rental properties in Lexington, South Carolina, (â€œthe Lexington propertiesâ€) to\r\n  Wimmer.\r\n10.&nbsp;The Snyders agreed to sell the Lexington properties to Wimmer for the\r\n  payoff amounts of the outstanding mortgage loan on the properties.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the Snyders did not expect to make a profit on the sale, seeking\r\n  only to be relieved of the debt associated with those properties.\r\n11. Neither Wimmer nor anyone else provided a down payment or any other\r\n  funds to the Snyders or to Snyder Enterprises in connection with the sale of\r\n  the Lexington properties.\r\n12.&nbsp;At Wimmerâ€™s instruction, the Snyders went to Waltersâ€™s law office to\r\n  complete paperwork for the sale of the Lexington properties to Wimmer.\r\n13. At Waltersâ€™s direction, Vicky Snyder signed seven blank HUD-1 Settlement\r\n  Statements (â€œHUD-1sâ€) and seven blank deeds.\r\n14. Instead of purchasing the Lexington properties himself, Wimmer arranged\r\n  for individuals from Utah to buy the Lexington properties.Â  These buyers\r\n  obtained mortgage loans from BB&amp;T to fund the purchases.\r\n15. Walters completed four of the HUD-1s signed by Vicky Snyder to reflect\r\n  that Snyder Enterprises was selling the properties identified on the HUD-1 to\r\n  an individual from Utah for a purchase price of $125,000.00 per property.Â \r\n  These four HUD-1s prepared by Walters also reflected that the buyer had paid a\r\n  $25,000.00 deposit to Snyder Enterprises per property, and that the buyer\r\n  brought approximately $1,900.00 to closing per property.\r\n16.&nbsp; Waltersâ€™s statements on the HUD-1s described in paragraph 15 above were\r\n  false in that:\r\n\r\n  (a) The Snyders, on behalf of Snyder Enterprises, did not agree to a\r\n    $125,000.00-per-property purchase price for four of the Lexington properties; \r\n  (b)&nbsp; None of the buyers in these four transactions paid $25,000.00 deposits;\r\n  (c)&nbsp; The Snyders, on behalf of Snyder Enterprises, did not receive\r\n    $25,000.00-per-property deposits in connection with the sale of four of the\r\n    Lexington properties; andÂ  \r\n  (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; None of the buyers in these four transactions brought approximately\r\n    $1,900.00 to closing. \r\n\r\n17.&nbsp; Wimmer paid the approximately $1,900.00 per closing which was shown on\r\n  the HUD-1s as cash from the buyers.Â  \r\n18. Walters provided the four false HUD-1s described in paragraph 15 above\r\n  to BB&amp;T.\r\n19. For each of these four transactions, BB&amp;T loaned the buyer\r\n  $100,000.00.Â  After closing costs, Walters disbursed the remainder of the\r\n  proceeds from each of the $100,000.00 loans as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp; $79,343.31 to pay off the existing mortgage; and\r\n  (b)&nbsp; $17,330.34 to Wimmerâ€™s company, Landmark Remodeling.\r\n\r\n20. Landmark Remodeling had not performed any services on these four\r\n  properties to earn the $17,330.34-per-property payment.\r\n21.&nbsp; For the remaining three Lexington properties, Walters prepared HUD-1s\r\n  reflecting that the individuals from Utah were refinancing properties they\r\n  already owned.Â  At the time he prepared these three HUD-1s, Walters knew that\r\n  these individuals were not the record owners of the properties and that the\r\n  purpose of the loans was to enable them to purchase the properties.Â  \r\n22. Walters provided the three false HUD-1s described in paragraph 21 above\r\n  to BB&amp;T.Â  \r\n23. For each of these three â€œrefinanceâ€ transactions, BB&amp;T loaned the\r\n  borrower $100,000.00. \r\n24. For each of these three transactions, Walters disbursed the loan\r\n  proceeds remaining after closing costs as follows: \r\n\r\n  (a) $79,343.31 to pay off the existing mortgage; and\r\n  (b) Approximately $15,800 to Wimmerâ€™s company, Landmark Remodeling.\r\n\r\n25. Landmark Remodeling had not performed any services on these three\r\n  properties to earn the approximately $15,800-per-property payment.\r\n26.&nbsp; Wimmer directed Walters to make the disbursements to Landmark Remodeling\r\n  described in paragraphs 19 and 24 above.\r\n27. Walters knew or should have known, at the time he prepared the HUD-1s\r\n  and made the disbursements for the sales of the Lexington properties, that\r\n  Landmark had not performed any services on the Lexington properties.\r\n28.&nbsp; Walters prepared the deeds transferring the Lexington properties from\r\n  Snyder Enterprises to the various individuals from Utah. \r\n29.&nbsp; The deeds Walters prepared for the transfer of the Lexington properties\r\n  falsely reflected that the purchase price for each property was $125,000.00.\r\n30.&nbsp; Walters caused the deeds reflecting false purchase prices for the Lexington properties to be filed in the public record.\r\n31. In May 2003, Walters served as closing attorney for a transaction in\r\n  which properties located at 807 Chesterfield Avenue and 1137 6th Street in Chester, South Carolina (â€œthe Chesterfield Ave and 6th Street propertiesâ€) were transferred on the same day from William &amp; Diane\r\n  Glassberg to REIC and from REIC to Robert Ellis.Â Â Â  \r\n32.&nbsp; The purchase price for REICâ€™s purchase of the properties was\r\n  $45,000.00.Â  The purchase price for Ellisâ€™s purchase of the properties on that\r\n  same day was $113,000.00.Â  \r\n33.&nbsp; Ellis obtained a $90,400.00 mortgage loan from BB&amp;T to fund his\r\n  purchase of the Chesterfield Ave and 6th Street properties.\r\n34. Walters prepared the HUD-1 Settlement Statement for Ellisâ€™s purchase of\r\n  these properties.Â  The HUD-1 prepared by Walters showed REIC as the seller and\r\n  reflected that the purchase price for the Chesterfield Ave and 6th Street properties was $113,000.00.Â  The HUD-1 prepared by Walters also\r\n  reflected that Ellis had paid REIC a deposit in the amount of $21,716.31, and\r\n  that Ellis brought $2,415.50 to closing.\r\n35.&nbsp; Waltersâ€™s statements on the HUD-1 described in paragraph 34 above were\r\n  false in that: \r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp; At the time the HUD-1 was prepared and submitted to the lender, REIC was\r\n    not the record owner of the property;\r\n  (b)&nbsp; Ellis did not pay any deposit to REIC;\r\n  (c)&nbsp; The purchase price reflected on the HUD-1 was artificially inflated; and\r\n  (d)&nbsp; Ellis did not bring any cash to closing.\r\n\r\n36.&nbsp; The HUD-1 prepared by Walters in connection with Ellisâ€™s purchase of the\r\n  Chesterfield Ave and 6th Street properties also stated that\r\n  $90,126.90 of the loan proceeds would be disbursed to the seller, REIC.Â  This\r\n  statement was false, in that Walters actually disbursed only $44,316.90 to\r\n  REIC.Â  The remaining $45,810.00 of Ellisâ€™s loan proceeds were used to fund\r\n  REICâ€™s purchase of the Chesterfield Ave and 6th Street properties.\r\n37.&nbsp; Walters did not disclose to his client, Ellis, information that he\r\n  learned from his representation of REIC, to wit:Â  That the properties securing\r\n  the $90,400.00 loan to Ellis were being sold to REIC for $45,000.00 earlier\r\n  that day, and that the loan proceeds for Ellisâ€™s purchase were used to fund\r\n  REICâ€™s purchase of the properties.Â Â  \r\n38. In May 2003, Walters served as closing attorney for a transaction in\r\n  which seven properties located in Lancaster, South Carolina were transferred\r\n  from William &amp; Diane Glassberg to REIC and, on that same day, four of those\r\n  seven properties were transferred from REIC to Kendrick Hicks (â€œHicksâ€).Â  \r\n39. The total purchase price for REICâ€™s purchase of the seven properties was\r\n  $75,000.00.Â  The purchase price for Hicksâ€™s purchase of the four properties on\r\n  that same day was $116,000.00.Â  \r\n40.&nbsp; Hicks obtained a $92,800.00 mortgage loan from BB&amp;T to fund his\r\n  purchase of these four properties from REIC.\r\n41.&nbsp; Walters prepared the HUD-1 Settlement Statement for Hicksâ€™s purchase of\r\n  these four properties.Â  The HUD-1 prepared by Walters showed REIC as the seller\r\n  and reflected that the purchase price was $116,000.00.Â  The HUD-1 prepared by\r\n  Walters also reflected that Hicks had paid REIC a deposit in the amount of\r\n  $23,200.00, and that Hicks brought $3,030.70 to closing.\r\n42. Waltersâ€™s statements on the HUD-1 described in paragraph 41 above were\r\n  false in that: \r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp; At the time the HUD-1 was prepared and submitted to the lender, REIC was\r\n    not the record owner of the property;\r\n  (b)&nbsp; Hicks did not pay any deposit to REIC;\r\n  (c)&nbsp; The purchase price reflected on the HUD-1 was artificially inflated; and\r\n  (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Hicks did not bring any cash to closing.Â  \r\n\r\n43.&nbsp; The HUD-1 prepared by Walters in connection with Hicksâ€™s purchase of these\r\n  four properties also stated that all $92,800.00 of the loan proceeds would be\r\n  disbursed to the seller, REIC.Â  This statement was false, in that Walters\r\n  actually disbursed only $16,651.65 to REIC.Â  The remaining $76,148.35 of\r\n  Hicksâ€™s loan proceeds were used to fund REICâ€™s purchase of all seven of the\r\n  properties.\r\n44.&nbsp; Walters did not disclose to his client, Hicks, information that he\r\n  learned from his representation of REIC, to wit:Â  That the properties securing\r\n  the $92,800.00 loan to Hicks were being sold to REIC for less than $75,000.00\r\n  earlier that day, and that the loan proceeds for Hicksâ€™s purchase were used to\r\n  fund REICâ€™s purchase of all seven of the properties.\r\n45.&nbsp; In May 2004, Walters served as closing attorney for transactions in\r\n  which properties located at 130 Saluda Street in Chester, South Carolina and 8 Elliott Street in Chester, South Carolina (â€œthe Saluda and Elliott Street propertiesâ€)\r\n  were transferred on the same day from Eric McLaren and Carl Campbell,\r\n  respectively, to REIC and from REIC to Sheila Pincock (â€œPincockâ€).Â  \r\n46.&nbsp; The total purchase price for REICâ€™s purchase of the properties was\r\n  $38,661.97.Â  The purchase price for Pincockâ€™s purchase of these properties was\r\n  $136,000.00.Â Â Â  \r\n47.&nbsp; Pincock obtained a $108,800.00 mortgage loan from BB&amp;T to fund her\r\n  purchase of the Saluda and Elliott Street properties.\r\n48.&nbsp;&nbsp; Walters prepared the HUD-1 Settlement Statement for Pincockâ€™s purchase\r\n  of the Saluda and Elliott Street properties and provided the HUD-1 to\r\n  BB&amp;T.Â  \r\n49. The HUD-1 prepared by Walters showed REIC as the seller and reflected\r\n  that the purchase price for the Saluda and Elliott Street properties was\r\n  $136,000.00.Â  The HUD-1 prepared by Walters also reflected that Pincock had\r\n  paid REIC a $27,200.00 deposit, and that Pincock brought $2,032.75 to closing.\r\n50.&nbsp; Waltersâ€™s statements on the HUD-1 described in paragraph 49 above were\r\n  false in that:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time the HUD-1 was prepared and submitted to the lender, REIC was\r\n    not the record owner of the properties;\r\n  (b)&nbsp; Pincock did not pay any deposit to REIC;\r\n  (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purchase price reflected on the HUD-1 was artificially inflated; and\r\n  (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Pincock did not bring any cash to closing.\r\n\r\n51.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walters did not disclose to his client, Pincock, information that he\r\n  learned from his representation of REIC, to wit:Â  That the properties securing\r\n  the $108,800.00 loan to Pincock were being sold to REIC for $38,661.97 that\r\n  same day.\r\n52.&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 2004, Walters served as closing attorney for a transaction in\r\n  which REIC bought a property at 1301 N. Lafayette Street in Shelby, North Carolina (â€œthe Shelby propertyâ€).Â  REIC bought this property for $49,600.00.\r\n53.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several days later, Walters served as closing attorney for a transaction\r\n  in which REIC sold the Shelby property to Marcus Beeson.\r\n54.&nbsp; Beeson obtained an $84,100.00 loan from BB&amp;T to fund his purchase of\r\n  the Shelby property. Â \r\n55.&nbsp;&nbsp; As closing attorney for Beesonâ€™s purchase of the Shelby property,\r\n  Walters represented the buyer/borrower and the lender in the transaction.Â  \r\n56.&nbsp; Walters prepared the HUD-1 Settlement Statement for Beesonâ€™s purchase of\r\n  the Shelby property.Â  The HUD-1 prepared by Walters reflected that the loan was\r\n  a refinance loan.Â Â Â  \r\n57.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HUD-1 prepared by Walters and described in paragraph 56 above was\r\n  false in that:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time the HUD-1 was prepared and submitted to the lender, Beeson\r\n    was not the record owner of the property;\r\n  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loan proceeds from BB&amp;T were used to fund Beesonâ€™s purchase of\r\n    the property.\r\n\r\n58.&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 2004, Walters served as closing attorney for a transaction\r\n  in which REIC bought a property at 130 Cushman Drive in Chester, South Carolina (â€œthe Cushman propertyâ€).Â  REIC bought this property for $22,500.00.\r\n59.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several days later, Walters served as closing attorney for a transaction\r\n  in which REIC sold the Cushman property to Jennifer Satterlee.\r\n60.&nbsp; Satterlee obtained an $83,000.00 loan from BB&amp;T to fund her purchase\r\n  of the Cushman property.\r\n61.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walters prepared the HUD-1 Settlement Statement for Satterleeâ€™s purchase\r\n  of the Cushman property.Â  The HUD-1 prepared by Walters reflected that the loan\r\n  was a refinance loan.Â Â Â  \r\n62.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TheÂ  HUD-1 prepared by Walters and described in paragraph 61 above was\r\n  false in that:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time the HUD-1 was prepared and submitted to the lender,\r\n    Satterlee was not the record owner of the property;\r\n  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The loan proceeds from BB&amp;T were actually used to fund Satterleeâ€™s\r\n    purchase of the property.\r\n\r\n63.&nbsp;&nbsp; Walters provided the HUD-1s described in paragraphs 56 and 61 above to\r\n  the lender, BB&amp;T.\r\n64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BB&amp;T underwrote the loans as if they were refinance loans rather\r\n  than purchase loans.Â  \r\n65.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walters knew that BB&amp;T would loan more money to the borrowers for a\r\n  refinance loan than for a purchase loan. \r\n66.&nbsp; Walters prepared these false refinance HUD-1s to enable the borrower to\r\n  borrow more money than otherwise would have been approved for a purchase loan.\r\n67.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By submitting a false refinance HUD-1 to BB&amp;T, Walters knowingly\r\n  made false statements to an institution the accounts of which were insured by\r\n  the FDIC for the purpose of influencing the action of that institution in\r\n  violation of 18&nbsp;U.S.C. Â§ 1014.Â  \r\n68.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walters disbursed the proceeds of Beesonâ€™s loan as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$49,375.00 to REIC; and\r\n  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $32,981.00 to Landmark Remodeling.\r\n\r\n69.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walters disbursed the proceeds of Satterleeâ€™s loan as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $21,284.77 to REIC; and\r\n  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;$60,328.73 to Landmark Remodeling.\r\n\r\n70.&nbsp; Landmark Remodeling had not performed any services on the Shelby or\r\n  Cushman properties to earn the $32,981.00 and $60,328.73 payments,\r\n  respectively.\r\n71.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wimmer directed Walters to make the disbursements to Landmark Remodeling\r\n  described in paragraphs 68 and 69 above.\r\n72.&nbsp; Walters knew or should have known, at the time he prepared the HUD-1s\r\n  and made the disbursements described in paragraphs 68 and 69 above that\r\n  Landmark had not performed any services on the Shelby or Cushman properties.\r\n73.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the following additional transactions, Walters also prepared HUD-1\r\n  Settlement Statements that falsely reflected that the loans were refinance\r\n  loans when in fact the borrowers used the loan proceeds to purchase the\r\n  properties:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Property\r\n      Borrower\r\n      Seller\r\n      Date\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    737 Ellis Avenue, NE\r\n      Orangeburg, SC\r\n    Frederick Atherley\r\n    Southeastern Regional Housing Cooperative, Inc.\r\n    12/12/2003\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    718 Sweeney Street\r\n      Chester, SC \r\n      &amp;\r\n      215 Sanders Street\r\n      Fort Mill, SC\r\n    Shawna Beeson\r\n    Rhett Hasell \r\n      &amp; \r\n      REIC\r\n    3/8/2004 \r\n      &amp; \r\n      3/9/2004\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    568 2nd Street \r\n      &amp;\r\n      538 4th Street\r\n      Chester, SC\r\n    Janie Wade\r\n    Richard A.

Â§ 1014.Â  \r\n79.&nbsp; Wimmer was convicted of bank fraud and money laundering in connection\r\n  with the real estate investment scheme described in the preceding paragraphs.Â \r\n  The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina sentenced\r\n  Wimmer to 63 months in prison and ordered him to pay $4 million in restitution.\r\n80. On 28 April 2008, Walters was charged with misprision of felony in\r\n  connection with Wimmerâ€™s real estate investment scheme.\r\n81.&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of misprision of felony are: (1) having knowledge of the\r\n  actual commission of a felony; and (2) concealing and failing to report the\r\n  felonious conduct.Â  See 18 U.S.C. Â§ 4.\r\n82.&nbsp; On 18 June 2008, Walters pled guilty to misprision of felony in\r\n  violation of Title 18 U.S.C. Â§ 4, South Carolina District Court file number 6:08-CR-385.Â \r\n  Judgment was entered on 30 September 2008.\r\nAs previously found by default judgment and now recited herein, based\r\n  on the foregoing Findings of Fact the hearing panel makes the following\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the parties are properly before the hearing panel and the panel has\r\n  jurisdiction over Defendant, Ivan N. Walters, and the subject matter.\r\n2.&nbsp; Defendantâ€™s conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above,\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 84-28(b)(1),\r\n  for his conviction of one count of misprision of felony in violation of 18\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 4, a criminal offense showing professional unfitness.\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendantâ€™s conduct, as set out in the Findings of Fact above, also\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C.

Â§ 1014â€”in\r\n    violation of Rule 8.4(b); and\r\n  (p)&nbsp; By engaging in\r\n    the felonious conduct for which he was convicted,Â  Walters committed a criminal\r\n    act that reflects adversely upon his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a\r\n    lawyer in violation of Rule 8.4(b), assisted his clientâ€”Wimmerâ€”in conduct he\r\n    knew was criminal or fraudulent in violation of Rule 1.2(d), and engaged in\r\n    conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation\r\n    of Rule 8.4(c).\r\n\r\nBased upon the foregoing Findings\r\n  of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the hearing panel hereby finds by clear,\r\n  cogent, and convincing evidence the following additional \r\nFindings of Fact Regarding\r\n  Discipline\r\n1.&nbsp;The findings in paragraphs 1 through 82 above are reincorporated as if\r\n  fully set forth herein.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walters has substantial experience in the practice of law.\r\n3.&nbsp; Walters was obligated, as closing attorney, to produce accurate HUD-1\r\n  statements for the transactions he closed.Â  Accurate HUD-1s are necessary for\r\n  the system of finance in real estate to function.\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The falsely inflated purchase prices and false down-payments shown on\r\n  the HUD-1s Walters provided to BB&amp;T were designed to mislead the lender\r\n  about the value of the properties which served as collateral for the mortgage\r\n  loans.\r\n5.&nbsp;Banks are not normally thought of as vulnerable entities.Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  lending institutions are placed at risk by the conduct of attorneys who\r\n  circumvent or knowingly facilitate othersâ€™ circumvention of safeguards employed\r\n  to avoid fraud.\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Waltersâ€™s preparation and submission of HUD-1s that failed to accurately\r\n  show the receipt and disbursement of funds for numerous transactions evaded the\r\n  safeguards relied upon by lenders in mortgage loan transactions.\r\n7.&nbsp;Waltersâ€™s preparation and submission of HUD-1s that made purchase\r\n  transactions falsely appear to be refinance transactions resulted in\r\n  significant harm in that it furthered and helped effectuate a scheme whereby\r\n  the bank loaned significantly more than it otherwise would have for a given\r\n  transaction.\r\n8.&nbsp;The buyers in the transactions described herein were Waltersâ€™s clients.Â \r\n  As buyers, one of their goals was not to pay an unnecessarily inflated price\r\n  for properties they were purchasing.Â  Waltersâ€™s failure to disclose to his\r\n  clients that the properties they were purchasing had just been sold for far\r\n  lesser sums impaired the buyersâ€™ ability to avoid paying unnecessarily inflated\r\n  prices.\r\n9.&nbsp; Walters engaged in multiple and similar instances of conduct involving\r\n  misrepresentation and deceit over a substantial period of time.\r\n10.&nbsp;Clients are entitled to attorneys they can trust.Â  Walters, by engaging\r\n  in conduct involving misrepresentation and deceit over a substantial period of\r\n  time, has shown himself to be untrustworthy.Â  \r\n11.&nbsp; Walters engaged in criminal conduct while acting in his capacity as a\r\n  lawyer.Â  His criminal conduct involved dishonesty.\r\n12. Waltersâ€™s criminal conviction is a matter of public record.\r\n13. When a lawyer is convicted of a serious crime, particularly a crime\r\n  involving dishonesty, it brings the legal profession into disrepute.Â  \r\n14.&nbsp; The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the different forms of\r\n  discipline available to it in considering the appropriate discipline to impose\r\n  in this case.\r\nBased upon the foregoing\r\n  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of Fact Regarding\r\n  Discipline, and upon consideration of the factors set forth in 27 N.C. Admin.\r\n  Code Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Â§ .0114(w), the hearing panel hereby enters the\r\n  following additional\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING DISCIPLINE\r\n1.&nbsp; The hearing panel has carefully considered all of the factors enumerated\r\n  in 27 N.C.A.C. 1B Â§ .0114(w) of the Rules and Regulations of the North Carolina\r\n  State Bar.Â  The hearing panel finds evidence of the following factors:\r\n\r\n  (a) From Rule .0114(w)(1):\r\n  \r\n     i.&nbsp; Intent of Defendant to cause the resulting harm or potential harm, in\r\n      that Walters knowingly prepared and submitted false HUD-1s to the banks in\r\n      order to assist Wimmer in fraudulent activity;\r\n     ii.&nbsp;&nbsp; Intent of Defendant to commit acts where the harm or potential harm is\r\n      foreseeable:Â  Our financial system is dependent upon accuracy and truthfulness\r\n      in disclosure, and harm or potential harm is foreseeable anytime a financial\r\n      institution is asked to make a loan decision based upon false information;\r\n     iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstances reflecting Defendantâ€™s lack of honesty, trustworthiness or\r\n      integrity;\r\n     iv.&nbsp; Impairment of clientsâ€™ ability to achieve the goals of the\r\n      representation; and\r\n    v.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication.Â  Walters\r\n      deceived BB&amp;T by preparing and submitting false HUD-1s and admitted (by\r\n      virtue of his plea) to knowingly concealing and/or failing to report Wimmerâ€™s\r\n      bank fraud and money laundering scheme.\r\n  \r\n  (b)From Rule .0114(w)(2):\r\n  \r\n     i.&nbsp;Acts of dishonesty, misrepresentation, deceit, or fabrication, as stated\r\n      in the Rule violations found and further articulated in these findings and\r\n      conclusions regarding discipline; and\r\n    ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission of a felony.\r\n  \r\n  (c) From Rule .0114(w)(3):\r\n  \r\n     i.&nbsp;Dishonest motive;\r\n     ii.&nbsp; A pattern of misconduct\r\n     iii.&nbsp; Multiple offenses; and\r\n    iv.&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantial experience in the practice of law.\r\n  \r\n\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Waltersâ€™s conduct resulted in at least potential significant harm to the\r\n  profession due to the public nature of his criminal charges and conviction.\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waltersâ€™s conduct resulted in significant harm and/or potential harm to\r\n  BB&amp;T.Â  Waltersâ€™s conduct evaded safeguards relied upon by BB&amp;T.Â \r\n  BB&amp;T loaned significantly more than it otherwise would have in the\r\n  transactions Walters falsely characterized as â€œrefinances,â€ and may have\r\n  approved other loans based on false information submitted by Walters.\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Waltersâ€™s pattern of dishonest conduct poses potential significant harm\r\n  to the public that may seek to retain him or those who may deal with him in\r\n  other capacities.Â  When a lawyer violates the trust clients and others should\r\n  be able to have in attorneys, it harms the public and the profession.\r\n5.&nbsp;The hearing panel has carefully considered admonition, reprimand,\r\n  censure, suspension and disbarment in considering the appropriate discipline in\r\n  this case.\r\n6.&nbsp; The hearing panel finds that admonition, reprimand, censure or suspension\r\n  would not be sufficient discipline because of the gravity of harm to clients,\r\n  the public, and the profession in the present case.Â  \r\n7.&nbsp; The hearing panel concludes that discipline short of disbarment would\r\n  not adequately protect the public for the reasons stated above and for the following\r\n  reasons:\r\n\r\n  a.&nbsp;Walters committed misdeeds involving moral turpitude and violations of\r\n    the public trust, including fraudulent conduct, material misrepresentations,\r\n    and deceit.Â  Misconduct involving misrepresentations and deceit are among the\r\n    most serious that an attorney can commit.Â  Such offenses demonstrate that the\r\n    offending attorney is not trustworthy.Â  Clients are entitled to have\r\n    trustworthy attorneys;\r\n  b.&nbsp;Walters repeatedly engaged in criminal acts reflecting adversely on his\r\n    honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer.\r\n  c. Entry of an order imposing less serious discipline would fail to\r\n    acknowledge the seriousness of the offenses Walters committed, would be\r\n    inconsistent with discipline issued in prior cases involving similar\r\n    misconduct, and would send the wrong message to attorneys and the public\r\n    regarding the conduct expected of members of the Bar of this State.\r\n  d.&nbsp;The protection of the public and the legal profession requires that\r\n    Walters not be permitted to resume the practice of law until he demonstrates\r\n    the following: that he has reformed; that he understands his obligations to his\r\n    clients, the public, and the legal profession; and that permitting him to\r\n    practice law will not be detrimental to the public or the integrity and\r\n    standing of the legal profession or the administration of justice. Disbarred\r\n    lawyers are required to make such a showing before they may resume practicing\r\n    law.\r\n\r\nBased upon the foregoing\r\n  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and additional Findings of Fact and\r\n  Conclusions of Law Regarding Discipline, the hearing panel hereby enters the\r\n  following\r\nORDER OF DISCIPLINE\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant, Ivan N. Walters, is hereby DISBARRED from the practice of\r\n  law.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant shall surrender his license and membership card to the\r\n  Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar no later than 30 days following\r\n  service of this order upon Defendant.\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Defendant shall pay the costs of this proceeding as assessed by the\r\n  Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar.Â  Defendant must pay the costs within\r\n  30 days of service upon him of the statement of costs by the Secretary.\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant shall comply with all provisions of 27 NCAC 1B Â§ .0124 of the North Carolina State Bar\r\n  Discipline &amp; Disability Rules.\r\nSigned by the Chair with the\r\n  consent of the other hearing panel members, this the 9 day of September,\r\n  2010.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    s/ J.

Code Ann. Â§ 17-11-20(B)(2) (Supp.\r\n  2010), we enter judgment for respondents.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Republican Party has scheduled a Presidential Preference Primary for\r\n  January 21, 2012.Â  In the 2011-2012 Appropriations Act, the General Assembly\r\n  provided that filing fees received from candidates to run in primary elections\r\n  may be used by the State Election Commission to conduct the 2012 Presidential\r\n  Preference Primary elections.Â  Act No. 73, 2011 S.C. Acts Â§ 79.6.Â  In addition,\r\n  the State Election Commission is authorized to use funds originally\r\n  appropriated for ballot security to conduct the Presidential Preference Primary\r\n  elections and the statewide primaries and runoffs.Â  Act No. 73, 2011 S.C. Acts\r\n  Â§ 79.12.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  contend the General Assembly has not authorized the State Election Commission\r\n  or the County Election Commissions to conduct a Presidential Preference Primary\r\n  in 2012 or any election cycle thereafter.Â  In addition, petitioners argue the\r\n  amount set forth in the Appropriations Act will be insufficient to cover the\r\n  actual costs to the counties of conducting the 2012 primary.\r\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\r\nI. Are the State Election\r\n  Commission and the County Election Commissions authorized and required to\r\n  conduct a 2012 Presidential Preference Primary?\r\nII. Has the General\r\n  Assembly appropriated sufficient funds for the State Election Commission and the\r\n  County Election Commissions to conduct a 2012 Presidential Preference Primary?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Authorization\r\n  and Requirement to Conduct Presidential Preference Primary\r\n\r\n  South\r\n    Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 17-11-20(B)(2) provides, in part:\r\n  For the 2008 election cycle, if the state committee of a certified political party\r\n    which received at least five percent of the popular vote in South Carolina for\r\n    the party's candidate for President of the United States decides to hold a\r\n    presidential preference primary election, the State Election Commission must\r\n      conduct the presidential preference primary in accordance with the\r\n    provisions of this title and party rules provided that a registered elector may\r\n    cast a ballot in only one presidential preference primary.Â  However,\r\n    notwithstanding any other provision of this title, (a) the State Election\r\n    Commission and the authorities responsible for conducting the elections in each\r\n    county shall provide for cost-effective measures in conducting the presidential\r\n    preference primaries including, but not limited to, combining polling places,\r\n    while ensuring that voters have adequate notice and access to the polling\r\n    places; and (b) the state committee of the party shall set the date and the\r\n    filing requirements, including a certification fee. . . . Â Political parties\r\n    may charge a certification fee to persons seeking to be candidates in the\r\n    presidential preference primary for the political party.Â  A filing fee not to\r\n    exceed twenty thousand dollars, as determined by the State Election Commission,\r\n    for each candidate certified by a political party must be transmitted by the\r\n    respective political party to the State Election Commission and must be used\r\n    for conducting the presidential preference primaries. \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Section 7-11-20(B)(4) states, &quot;Nothing in this section prevents a\r\n  political party from conducting a presidential preference primary for the\r\n    2008 election cycle pursuant to the provisions of Section 7-11-25.&quot;Â \r\n  (emphasis added).[1]Â  \r\nAlthough Petitioners\r\n  admit these provisions authorized the State Election Commission and the County Election\r\n  Commissions to conduct the 2008 Presidential Preference Primaries, they argue\r\n  these provisions applied only to the 2008 primaries and not to any subsequent\r\n  primaries.Â  Accordingly, petitioners contend the State Election Commission and\r\n  the County Election Commissions have no authority to conduct the 2012 Presidential\r\n  Preference Primary or any future Presidential Preference Primaries.Â  Petitioners\r\n  argue the statute should be construed to create a limited exception, solely for\r\n  the 2008 election cycle, to the traditional practice of political parties\r\n  conducting their own Presidential Preference Primaries.Â  \r\nWe would agree\r\n  with Petitioners if Â§ 17-11-20(B)(2) were the only expression of legislative\r\n  intent before us.Â  But, as discussed below, we must consider the operative\r\n  budget provisos for the current fiscal year, as well as our precedent that\r\n  speaks to the relationship of a legislative proviso juxtaposed to a permanent\r\n  statute.\r\nThe primary rule of statutory construction is to\r\n  ascertain and give effect to the intent of the General Assembly.Â  Town of\r\n    Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 342, 713 S.E.2d 278, 283 (2011).Â  This Court has held that a statute shall\r\n  not be construed by concentrating on an isolated phrase.Â  Laurens County Sch. Dists. 55 &amp; 56 v. Cox, 308 S.C. 171, 174, 417\r\n  S.E.2d 560, 561 (&quot;The true guide to statutory construction\r\n  is not the phraseology of an isolated section or provision, but the language of\r\n  the statute as a whole considered in the light of its manifest purpose. Â In\r\n  applying the rule of strict construction the courts may not give to particular\r\n  words a significance clearly repugnant to the meaning of the statute as a\r\n  whole, or destructive of its obvious intent.&quot;); see also Sloan\r\n    v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs,\r\n  370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606-07 (2006) (&quot;A\r\n  statute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation\r\n  consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.&quot;). Â &quot;All rules of statutory construction are\r\n  subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be\r\n  reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed\r\n  in light of the intended purpose of the statute.&quot; State v. Sweat,\r\n  386 S.C. 339, 350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010).Â  Moreover, it is well settled that statutes dealing with the\r\n  same subject matter are in pari materia and must be construed together,\r\n  if possible, to produce a single, harmonious result. Â Joiner ex rel. Rivas\r\n    v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000).\r\nSection 7-11-20(B)(2)\r\n  is included in the permanent laws of this state.Â  Following the limitation to\r\n  the 2008 election cycle, Â§ 7-11-20(B)(2) speaks more broadly to a general\r\n  application, where it states in part, &quot;[h]owever, notwithstanding any\r\n  other provision of this title . . . .&quot; (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  statute must be construed in light of the entirety of Chapter 11 of Title 7. Â Although the body of Â§ 7-11-20(B)(2)\r\n  refers to the 2008 election cycle, the title of the act does not indicate that\r\n  the General Assembly intended to limit the provisions to 2008.Â  Instead, the\r\n  title states the act is:\r\n\r\n  AN ACT TO AMEND SECTIONS 7-11-20 AND 7-13-15, BOTH AS AMENDED,\r\n    CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, 1976, RELATING TO PARTY CONVENTIONS AND PARTY\r\n    PRIMARY ELECTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE STATE ELECTION COMMISSION AND COUNTY\r\n    ELECTION COMMISSIONS, SO AS TO PROVIDE THAT THE STATE ELECTION COMMISSION\r\n    CONDUCT PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCE PRIMARIES, THAT THE STATE COMMITTEE OF THE\r\n    PARTY SET THE DATE, FILING REQUIREMENTS AND CERTIFICATION FEE FOR THE\r\n    PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCE PRIMARIES, TO PROVIDE A PROCEDURE FOR VERIFICATION OF\r\n    THE QUALIFICATION OF CANDIDATES, TO CLARIFY CERTAIN EXISTING PROVISIONS\r\n    CONCERNING PRIMARIES, AND TO SPECIFY WHICH PRIMARIES MUST BE CONDUCTED BY THE\r\n    STATE ELECTION COMMISSION AND COUNTY ELECTION COMMISSION; TO DESIGNATE SECTION\r\n    14 OF ACT 253 OF 1992 AS SECTION 7-11-25, RELATING TO POLITICAL PARTIES NOT\r\n    PROHIBITED FROM CONDUCTING PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCE OR ADVISORY PRIMARIES, SO AS\r\n    TO DELETE THE REFERENCES TO PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCE PRIMARIES; AND BY ADDING\r\n    SECTION 7-9-110 SO AS TO AUTHORIZE A POLITICAL PARTY OR STATE ELECTION\r\n    COMMISSION TO CONDUCT A PRIMARY OR ELECTION, WITHOUT CHARGE, IN A FACILITY THAT\r\n    RECEIVES STATE FUNDS FOR SUPPORT OR OPERATION.\r\n\r\nA recent opinion\r\n  of the Attorney General states the statute is a permanent statute and is not\r\n  limited to the 2008 Presidential Preference Primary.Â  2011 Op. Att'y Gen. dated\r\n  June 27, 2011, 2011 WL\r\n  2648710.Â  The opinion refers to the fact that the title does not contain the\r\n  2008 limitation[2] as well as the fact that the statute was codified at the direction of the General\r\n  Assembly in the permanent laws of the State rather than as a local or temporary\r\n  law.Â  Id.Â  We agree with the Attorney General insofar as he recognizes\r\n  the statute was codified by the General Assembly as a permanent statute and the\r\n  title contains no temporal limitation.Â  However, absent the current provisos,\r\n  the temporal limitation in Â§ 7-11-20(B) would be respected.Â  This brings us to\r\n  discerning legislative intent and the effect of Provisos 79.6 and 79.12.\r\nWe reject any\r\n  suggestion that the entirety of Â§ 7-11-20(B) is meaningless when viewed through\r\n  the lens of the current budget provisos. Â As noted, Â§ 7-11-20(B) is a permanent\r\n  statute.Â  We hold the provisos of the 2011-2012 Appropriations Act allowing the\r\n  State Election Commission to use funds toward a Presidential Preference Primary\r\n  suspend the temporal limitation of Â§ 7-11-20(B) and authorize the State Election\r\n  Commission and the County Election Commissions to conduct a Presidential\r\n  Preferential Primary in 2012.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Proviso\r\n  79.6 provides:\r\n\r\n  Filing\r\n    fees received from candidates filing to run in statewide or special primary\r\n    elections may be retained and expended by the State Election Commission to pay\r\n    for the conduct of primary elections.Â  Any balance in the filing fee accounts\r\n    on June thirtieth, [sic] of the prior fiscal year may be carried forward and\r\n    expended for the same purposes during the current fiscal year.Â  In addition,\r\n    any balance in the Primary and General Election Accounts on June thirtieth,\r\n    [sic] of the prior fiscal year may be carried forward and expended for the same\r\n    purposes during the current fiscal year.Â  In addition, the aforementioned funds\r\n    may also be utilized to conduct the 2012 Presidential Preference Primary\r\n      elections.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Proviso 79.12 provides, &quot;The\r\n  State Election Commission is authorized to carry forward and use funds originally appropriated for Ballot Security to conduct the 2012\r\n  Presidential Preference Primary elections and the 2012 Statewide\r\n  Primaries/Runoff.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).\r\nAs a permanent\r\n  statute, the portions of Â§ 7-11-20(B)(2) which do not conflict with the\r\n  2011-2012 Appropriations Act remain viable.Â  Only the terms of that section\r\n  which conflict with the current budget are suspended.Â  State ex rel. McLeod\r\n    v. Mills, 256 S.C. 21, 26, 180 S.E.2d 638, 640 (1971) (finding only the\r\n  provisions of the permanent statute that conflicted with the budget provisos\r\n  were suspended during the fiscal year).Â  We must reject petitioners' invitation\r\n  to view the statute and budget provisos in isolation, a position which violates\r\n  our rules of statutory construction.Â  We must not only seek to discern\r\n  legislative intent from all lawful enactments of the General Assembly - the\r\n  statutory scheme and budget provisos - but we must also respect our\r\n  settled law that suspends a conflicting permanent statutory provision while a\r\n  proviso is in effect. Â Id.Â  Accordingly, only the language limiting that\r\n  section to the 2008 election cycle must be stricken as that is the only\r\n  provision of the statute in conflict with the current budget provisos.Â  \r\nMoreover, we cannot\r\n  ignore the final provision of the 2011-2012 Appropriations Act in which the General\r\n  Assembly stated, &quot;All acts or parts\r\n  of acts inconsistent with any of the provisions of Parts IA or IB of this act\r\n  are suspended for Fiscal Year 2011-2012.&quot;Â  By passing the relevant budget\r\n  provisos, the General Assembly, thus, has expressly provided that the temporal\r\n  limitation in Â§ 17-11-20(B)(2) must be suspended\r\n  during the current fiscal year.Â  See McLeod, 256 S.C. at 26, 180\r\n  S.E.2d at 640 (&quot;There is no doubt that the legislature has the power,\r\n  where there is no constitutional prohibition, to suspend the operation of a\r\n  statute.Â  When such intention is clearly manifest this court has no choice but\r\n  to give force and effect thereto.&quot;).Â  \r\nAs additional\r\n  evidence of legislative intent, it is instructive to note that the Governor\r\n  vetoed provisos 79.6 and 79.12.Â  In her veto message, the Governor wrote:\r\nPrior to\r\n  2008, the taxpayers of South Carolina had never funded the First in the South\r\n  Presidential Primary - instead, the political parties did.Â  As I have made\r\n  clear throughout the budget process, I believe private dollars are the\r\n  appropriate way to fund a partisan Presidential Primary.Â  The Attorney General\r\n  of South Carolina has recognized that the State GOP can contract with the State\r\n  Election Commission to run the primary.Â  The United States Department of\r\n  Justice has cleared an election conducted by the Election Commission and funded\r\n  by a political party.Â  The bottom line is this:Â  South Carolina will host the\r\n  First in the South Presidential Primary in 2012 and will be as successful as it\r\n  always has been, but it should not fall on the taxpayers to cover the expense.Â \r\n  For these reasons, we are vetoing these provisos.\r\nGovernor's\r\n  Message to the Members of the General Assembly Transmitting Line-Item Vetoes of\r\n  Portions of the 2011-2012 General Appropriations Act (June 28, 2011).\r\nThe Governor\r\n  clearly understood the intent of the General Assembly to adhere to the 2008 public\r\n  funding approach in fiscal year 2011-2012 and sought to oppose it.[3]Â  The General Assembly, in turn,\r\n  clearly understood the import and consequences of overriding the Governor's\r\n  veto - the effect of the budget provisos was to suspend the temporal limitation\r\n  in Â§ 17-11-20(B)(2).Â  A contrary construction of legislative intent would mean\r\n  the Governor and the General Assembly were not aware what was intended by the\r\n  provisos, a result which would border on frivolity. \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  hold that provisos 79.6 and 79.12 suspend the temporal limitation in Â§ 7-11-20(B)(2)\r\n  and authorize the State Election Commission and the County Election Commissions\r\n  to conduct Presidential Preference Primaries in 2012.[4]Â  If they were not so construed, the\r\n  provisos would authorize the State Election Commission to carry over certain\r\n  funds to perform an unauthorized act, which would be an absurd result.Â  See Lancaster\r\n    County Bar Ass'n v. S.C. Comm'n on Indigent Defense, 380 S.C. 219, 670\r\n  S.E.2d 371 (2008) (holding that, in construing a statute, this Court will\r\n  reject an interpretation which leads to an absurd result which could not have\r\n  been intended by the General Assembly); Gordon v. Phillips Util., Inc., 362\r\n  S.C. 403, 608 S.E.2d 425 (2005) (noting it is presumed that the General\r\n  Assembly intended to accomplish something by its choice of words and would not\r\n  do a futile thing); Denene, Inc. v.\r\n    City of Charleston, 352\r\n  S.C. 208, 574 S.E.2d 196 (2002) (finding that this Court must presume the General Assembly did not intend a\r\n  futile act, but rather intended its statutes to accomplish something). \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sufficiency of Funds Appropriated for\r\n  Presidential Preference Primary\r\nPetitioners'\r\n  argument that the funds appropriated for conducting a 2012 Presidential\r\n  Preference Primary are insufficient presents a nonjusticiable political\r\n  question.Â  Accordingly, we decline to address that argument.Â  Segars-Andrews v. Judicial Merit Selection Comm'n., 387 S.C. 109, 691 S.E.2d 453 (2010); S.C. Pub. Interest Found. v. Judicial Merit Selection\r\n    Comm'n, 369 S.C. 139, 632 S.E.2d 277\r\n  (2006);Â  see also State ex rel.\r\n    Condon v. Hodges, 349 S.C. 232, 562 S.E.2d 623\r\n  (2002); Gilstrap v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 310\r\n  S.C. 210, 423 S.E.2d 101 (1992) (holding the appropriation of public funds is a\r\n  legislative function); Clarke v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth., 177 S.C. 427,\r\n  181 S.E. 481 (1935) (noting the General Assembly has full authority to make appropriations as it\r\n  deems wise in absence of any specific constitutional prohibition against the\r\n  appropriation).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHaving held the General\r\n  Assembly has authorized and directed that Presidential Preference Primaries be\r\n  conducted in South Carolina in 2012 by the State Election Commission and the\r\n  County Election Commissions, we declare that such\r\n  Presidential Preference Primaries shall be conducted in accordance with the\r\n  provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-11-20(B)(2) (Supp. 2010) and Provisos 79.6\r\n  and 79.12 of Part II of the 2011-2012 General Appropriations Act, Act. No. 73,\r\n  2011 S.C. Acts Â§Â§79.6 and 79.12.\r\nAt the present time, the\r\n  practical effect of this declaratory judgment is as follows: For the 2012 election\r\n  cycle, the state committee of the Republican Party of South Carolina, a\r\n  certified political party which received at least five percent of the popular\r\n  vote in South Carolina for its presidential candidate in the 2008 General\r\n  Election, has decided to hold a Republican Presidential Preference Primary\r\n  Election on January 21, 2012. The State Election Commission and the County Election\r\n  Commissions for each of the 46 counties must conduct this Presidential Preference\r\n  Primary.\r\nThe only other political\r\n  party in South Carolina which is eligible to conduct a Presidential Preference Primary\r\n  is the South Carolina Democratic Party. Thus far, it has not decided to conduct\r\n  such a primary. Â If it decides to do so, the State Election Commission and the\r\n  County Election Commissions will also be required to conduct such a primary\r\n  pursuant to the above set forth provisions of state law.\r\nFinally, it has been brought\r\n  to the attention of the Court that the State Election Commission's website (www.scvotes.org) advises that the proposed ballot for the January 21,\r\n  2012, South Carolina Republican Presidential Preference Primary will include\r\n  candidates as follows: Michele\r\n  Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Gary Johnson, Ron Paul,\r\n  Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum, and will also include four (4)\r\n  nonbinding advisory questions. Nothing in the statutes upon which this\r\n  declaratory judgment is rendered and no provision of South Carolina law would\r\n  allow the ballot for a publically funded Presidential Preference Primary to\r\n  include anything other than the names of candidates for a qualifying political\r\n  party's nominee for President of the United States. Accordingly, the State Election\r\n  Commission and the County Election Commissions are hereby directed that they\r\n  may not print such ballots or conduct such primaries for any matter other than\r\n  the nomination of party candidates for President of the United States. No\r\n  advisory questions may be included on any such primary ballots. Additionally,\r\n  no other advisory elections, straw polls, or the like on any question may be\r\n  conducted at the various Presidential Preference Primary polling places or\r\n  within 200 feet of the entrance to such polling places.\r\nJUDGMENT FOR\r\n  RESPONDENTS.\r\nPLEICONES and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. Â HEARN, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\n  BEATTY, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  HEARN:Â  Respectfully, I\r\n  concur in part and dissent in part.Â  While I agree with the majority that the\r\n  plain language of Section 7-11-20(B)(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010)\r\n  is limited only to the 2008 election cycle, I believe the majority misapplies\r\n  our precedents concerning appropriations provisos and erroneously concludes\r\n  Provisos 79.6 and 79.12 suspend this temporal limitation.Â  I would therefore\r\n  find no requirement that either the State Election Commission or the county\r\n  election commissions conduct the 2012 Presidential Preference Primary.\r\nI note at the\r\n  outset that this case involves a non-binding presidential preference primary,\r\n  rather than general elections and regular primaries which are unquestionably\r\n  core functions of our State government.Â  Hence, presidential preference\r\n  primaries are excepted from the general statutes mandating the State and county\r\n  commissions conduct primaries. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-15(A)(2),\r\n  (B)(1) (Supp. 2010).Â  I therefore begin with the premise that the State\r\n  Commission and county commissions have no involvement in these preference\r\n  primaries absent specific statutory authority.[5]\r\nIt has long been\r\n  the law in this State that an appropriation act &quot;has equal force and\r\n  effect as a permanent statute&quot; and can suspend the operation of a general\r\n  law while it is in effect. Plowden v. Beattie, 185 S.C. 229, 236, 193\r\n  S.E. 651, 654 (1937).Â  However, there must be an &quot;irreconcilable\r\n  conflict&quot; between the appropriation and the general law before the latter\r\n  is temporarily suspended. Id.Â  We must therefore attempt to harmonize\r\n  the statute and the budget proviso, for &quot;'[i]f, by any reasonable\r\n  construction, the two statutes can stand together, they must so stand.Â  If\r\n  harmony is impossible, and only in that event, the former law is repealed in\r\n  part, or wholly, as the case may be.'&quot; State ex rel. McLeod v. Mills,\r\n  256 S.C. 21, 26, 180 S.E.2d 638, 641 (1971) (quoting State ex rel. Buchanan\r\n    v. Jennings, 68 S.C. 411, 415, 47 S.E. 683, 684 (1904)).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  &quot;[i]t is well settled that statutes dealing with the same subject matter\r\n  are in pari materia and must be construed together, if possible, to\r\n  produce a single, harmonious result.&quot; Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas,\r\n  342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000).\r\n  \r\n\r\nA review of the\r\n  cases from our jurisprudence where a proviso has suspended a general law all\r\n  involve precise and direct conflicts that are incapable of being harmonized.Â \r\n  In Buchanan, the General Assembly passed an act setting the salary of a\r\n  circuit judge at $3,000 per year. 68 S.C. at 412, 47 S.E. at 683.Â  The next\r\n  day, the General Assembly approved an appropriation which set a judge's salary\r\n  at $3,500 per year. Id.Â  As there was no possible way to harmonize this\r\n  conflict, this Court held the appropriation suspended the statute. Id. at 415, 47 S.E. at 684.Â  Similarly, in Brooks v. Jones, 80 S.C. 443, 61\r\n  S.E. 946 (1908), the General Assembly set the annual salary of the clerk of the\r\n  Supreme Court at $800 by statute, but later passed an appropriation setting his\r\n  salary at $1,000 per year. Id. at 448-49, 61 S.E. at 947 (Jones, J.,\r\n  concurring in part and dissenting in part).Â  Once again, the Court held the\r\n  appropriations bill could not be reconciled and suspended the operation of the\r\n  statute. Id. at 449, 61 S.E. at 947.[6]Â  The issue in Plowden was\r\n  identical, with an appropriations bill changing (this time lowering) the salary\r\n  for the Auditor of Clarendon County. 185 S.C. at 234, 193 S.E. at 653-54.Â \r\n  After citing Brooks, id. at 236-37, 193 S.E. at 654-55, the Court\r\n  held the appropriation act prevailed, id. at 241-42, 193 S.E. at 657.Â \r\n  Finally, McLeod cited Buchanan, Brooks, and Plowden to hold that an appropriation's reduction of a salary set by statute controlled\r\n  as long as the appropriation was in effect. 256 S.C. at 26-28, 180 S.E.2d at\r\n  640-42.Â  Thus, in order for the majority's position to be correct, the provisos\r\n  must be completely at odds with the general law.Â  \r\nAs a threshold\r\n  matter, I note that the majority and the parties themselves mistakenly identify\r\n  the source of the perceived conflict with the provisos as being section\r\n  7-11-20(B)(2).Â  As the majority correctly holds, that section by its very terms\r\n  does not operate past the 2008 election cycle.Â  Thus, the current budget\r\n  provisos cannot conflict with the language &quot;[f]or the 2008 election\r\n  cycle&quot;â€”or indeed any language in section 7-11-20(B)(2)â€”because it is not\r\n  in effect for the 2011-2012 fiscal year.Â  In other words, the notion that the\r\n  provisos can suspend the temporal limitation in section 7-11-20(B)(2) is\r\n  spurious because it is impossible to suspend something that is no longer in effect,\r\n  as a prerequisite to finding a conflict is the existence of something to\r\n  conflict with.Â  Any conflict therefore must be between the provisos and the law\r\n  as it currently stands, which is that the political parties themselves are\r\n  responsible for the primaries.[7] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-11-20(B)(1) (Supp. 2010).\r\nWhen the provisos\r\n  are read together with the current law, I find no conflict.Â  Proviso 79.6\r\n  states that filing fees from the political parties seeking to hold primaries\r\n  &quot;may also be utilized [by the State Commission] to conduct the 2012\r\n  Presidential Preference Primary elections.&quot;Â  2011 Act No. 73, Pt. 1B Â§\r\n  79.6 (emphasis added).Â  Proviso 79.12 provides that the State Commission is\r\n  &quot;authorized to carry forward and use funds originally appropriated\r\n  for Ballot Security to conduct the 2012 Presidential Preference Primary\r\n  elections.&quot; Id. Â§ 79.12 (emphasis added).Â  Rather than infringing\r\n  at all on the responsibility of the political parties to conduct and run their\r\n  primaries, Provisos 79.6 and 79.12 merely grant the State Commission the\r\n  authority to participate should it choose to do so.Â  Because the provisos\r\n  complement the current law, I would hold that each should be given full\r\n  effect.Â  Thus, the responsibility for conducting the 2012 Presidential Preference\r\n  Primary falls on the political parties, only to be supplemented by the State\r\n  Commission in its discretion.Â  Moreover, there is nothing in the provisos which\r\n  would require the county commissions, or the State Commission for that matter,\r\n  to shoulder the economic burden of a presidential preference primary.Â  It is\r\n  clear to me that the provisos envisioned different roles for the State and\r\n  county commissions in 2012 than in 2008, and they provide no basis for us to\r\n  resurrect and breathe new life into section 7-11-20(B)(2).\r\nIt is true that\r\n  the General Assembly often uses the words &quot;may&quot; and\r\n  &quot;authorize&quot; in various appropriations, and I agree that the recipient\r\n  of those funds can be mandated to use them for a particular purpose.Â  But for\r\n  that to be true, a mandate must already exist.Â  If not, all provisos would be\r\n  converted into express commands that the funds appropriated must be spent.Â  The\r\n  fallacy in this case of concluding these permissive provisos are part of a\r\n  mandate that the State Commission conduct the upcoming primary is the\r\n  assumption that there is already a valid and existing mandate.Â  The majority\r\n  recognizes that outside of the provisos, no such mandate exists for 2012.Â \r\n  Because the plain language of the provisos is purely permissive, I accordingly\r\n  decline to read any compulsory terms into them.Â  Finding otherwise is directly\r\n  contrary to the cases holding we follow the plain language of a statute and\r\n  that a general law is suspended only to the extent there is an &quot;irreconcilable\r\n  conflict.&quot;[8]\r\nNot surprisingly,\r\n  the majority fails to identify just what conflict requires the suspension of\r\n  the temporal limitation.Â  While an appropriations bill can certainly speak to\r\n  other issues than salaries, I believe our prior cases are instructive because\r\n  they illustrate just how irresoluble a conflict must be in order to suspend a\r\n  general law.Â  Commands to pay different salaries cannot be reconciled or\r\n  harmonized, and therefore this Court correctly held in all of those cases that\r\n  the salary provided for in the appropriations bill, be it higher or lower than\r\n  that already provided by statute, controlled.Â  No such conflict exists here.Â \r\n  Had the provisos never been enacted, there would be no authority for either the\r\n  State or county commissions to conduct the 2012 Presidential Preference Primary\r\n  since the prior mandate imposed by section 7-11-20(B)(2) was limited to just\r\n  &quot;the 2008 election cycle.&quot;Â  Consistent with years of prior practice\r\n  and statutory authority, it is therefore the responsibility of the political\r\n  parties to conduct the upcoming primary.Â  Provisos 79.6 and 79.12, merely\r\n  authorize the State Commissionâ€”and only the State Commission as they do not\r\n  speak about the county commissions at allâ€”to participate.Â  These are readily\r\n  harmonized, and I decline to read anything more into the provisos or out of the\r\n  statute.\r\nIn support of its\r\n  position, the majority turns to the statement of the Governor in her veto of\r\n  the provisos and the General Assembly's override of that veto.Â  However, the\r\n  resolution of this important question turns solely on the impact of the\r\n  provisos themselves, not on their veto by the Governor or the legislative\r\n  override of that veto.Â  Indeed, the fact that the majority must resort to such\r\n  extrinsic aids is proof that the perceived conflict is not as self-evident as\r\n  the majority suggests.Â  In my view, holding that a subsequently enacted proviso\r\n  supersedes a prior law is an extraordinary measure to be undertaken only when\r\n  the conflict is clear on its face.Â  I am also not persuaded that we should\r\n  speculate as to what the override meant based on the limited record before us. Cf.\r\n    CFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty. Assessor, Op. No. 27032 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed\r\n  Aug. 29, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 29 at 28-29) (holding that where the\r\n  failure of the General Assembly to enact certain legislation could work equally\r\n  to the advantage of both parties, it is error to rely on it).\r\nThe majority also\r\n  writes that absent a suspension, the State Commission could carry over funds to\r\n  do something it is not authorized to do, which would be an absurd result.Â \r\n  However, the provisos themselves are sufficient to confer upon the State\r\n  Commission the ability to participate in the 2012 primary even if section\r\n  7-11-20(B)(2) is no longer in effect.Â  Thus, there is no absurd result because\r\n  it can carry over funds for an authorized act.Â  However, whether it and the\r\n  county commissions are required to do so is an entirely different\r\n  question.Â  Because the provisos neither mention the county commissions nor\r\n  speak in mandatory terms, I believe it is error to insert these requirements\r\n  into section 7-11-20. See Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 55-56, 426\r\n  S.E.2d 760, 763 (1993) (stating it is &quot;improvident to judicially engraft\r\n  extra requirements into legislation which is clear on its face&quot;).\r\nAs a final\r\n  matter, I note that the majority is permitting Respondents to accomplish\r\n  judicially what they either could not or would not do legislatively, despite\r\n  repeated attempts.Â  In enacting section 7-11-20(B)(2), a bill was proposed that\r\n  would have eliminated any references to the 2008 election cycle. S. 1279 117th\r\n  Gen. Assem. (S.C. 2008).Â  Another bill was introduced in 2011 that would have\r\n  done the same. S. 794 119th Gen. Assem. (S.C. 2011).Â  In rejecting these\r\n  proposals, the General Assembly manifested its intent that mandatory\r\n  involvement on the part of the State and county commissions was limited to\r\n  2008. See Stardancer Casino, Inc. v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 385 &amp;\r\n  n.13, 556 S.E.2d 357, 361 &amp; n.13 (2001) (noting that the General Assembly's\r\n  failure to enact two acts contemporaneous with the act in question is evidence\r\n  that the provisions in the failed bills were not meant to be included).Â  While\r\n  the General Assembly very well could have required this again in 2012, either\r\n  through another statutory amendment or the budget provisos, it did not do so.Â  \r\nIn conclusion, I\r\n  would hold that Provisos 79.6 and 79.12 merely grant the State Commission the\r\n  authority to participate in the 2012 Presidential Preference Primary. [9] However, I do not believe this grant of authority revives section 7-11-20(B)(2)\r\n  because that provision was, by its terms, limited to the 2008 election cycle.Â \r\n  Moreover, what the provisos permit the State Commission to do is not\r\n  what the statute required the State and county commissions to do during the\r\n  2008 election cycle.Â  While the counties should work with the political parties\r\n  to ensure the smooth operation of the primary and access to polling places, I\r\n  would hold that there is no statutory mandate that they conduct the primary at\r\n  their own expense.Â  Most assuredly, I would not place an even greater financial\r\n  burden on the counties by permitting the inclusion of advisory questions on the\r\n  primary ballot, and on that issue, I concur with the majority.\r\nBEATTY, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 7-11-25 provides, &quot;Except for the\r\n  provisions of Section 7-11-20 related to presidential preference primaries,\r\n  nothing in this chapter nor any other provision of law may be construed as\r\n  either requiring or prohibiting a political party in this State from conducting\r\n  advisory primaries according to the party's own rules and at the party's\r\n  expense.&quot;Â  \r\n[2] This Court may, of course, consider the title or caption of an act in determining the intent of\r\n  the Legislature.Â  Joytime Distrib. &amp; Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338\r\n  S.C. 634, 528 S.E.2d 647 (1999).\r\n[3] Whether the expense of a Presidential Preference Primary\r\n  should be borne by the political parties or the taxpayers is a policy decision,\r\n  one that lies exclusively in the General Assembly.\r\n[4] The dissent accepts petitioners' argument that the\r\n  budget provisos are merely permissive, allowing the State Commission to\r\n  participate in the primaries should it choose to do so.Â  We respectfully\r\n  disagree.Â  Ostensibly, the words &quot;may&quot; and &quot;authorize&quot;\r\n  appear permissive, but such terms are commonly invoked in the context of budget\r\n  provisos.Â  The General Assembly, for example, routinely uses the word &quot;may&quot;\r\n  in budget provisos in connection with an agency's ability to utilize a\r\n  designated funding source.Â  In the 2011-2012 Appropriations Act, the General\r\n  Assembly used the word &quot;may&quot; in multiple budget provisos in addition\r\n  to the ones in section 79.Â  See Act No. 73, 2011 S.C. Acts Â§Â§ 1.7\r\n  (Governor's School for Science &amp; Math);\r\n  1.13 (School Lunch Program Aid); 4.1 (School\r\n  for the Deaf and the Blind); 22.36 (Department of\r\n  Health &amp; Environmental Control); 26.4 (Department of Social Services); 28.1\r\n  (Department of Archives &amp; History); 38.1 (Sea Grant Consortium); 39.13 (Department\r\n  of Parks &amp; Recreation); 46.4 (Prosecution Coordination Commission); 65.1\r\n  (Department of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation); 66.4 (Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicles); 74.1 (Secretary of State).Â  The General\r\n  Assembly's approach to budget provisos for fiscal year 2011-2012, with its\r\n  common usage of the term &quot;may,&quot; was no different than its approach in\r\n  prior years.Â  Simply stated, the word &quot;may&quot; should not be viewed out\r\n  of the budget proviso context in which it appears.Â  An agency's authority to\r\n  utilize a particular funding source does not transform the underlying legislation\r\n  from a mandatory one to a permissive one.\r\nBecause we are tasked with ascertaining legislative intent,\r\n  we further point to the fact that the House of Representatives rejected a\r\n  proposed amendment to the provisos, which would have stricken the State Election\r\n  Commission's and the County Election Commissions'\r\n  duty to conduct the Presidential Preference Primaries.Â  A statement by\r\n  Representative Quinn and others was included in the House Journal:\r\n\r\n  While I\r\n    support the idea of raising private funds to save tax dollars, I voted to table\r\n    [the proposed amendment] for two major reasons.Â  First, conducting elections is\r\n    a core function of government.Â  And no election is more important than the\r\n    Presidency of the United States.Â  Second, recent federal court cases and\r\n    justice department decisions will potentially make a purely privately paid for\r\n    election infeasible.\r\n\r\n2011 House Journal March 15, 2011,\r\n  p.97 (statement of Rep. Richard Quinn, et al., regarding Amendment No. 71).\r\n[5] This is not to suggest that preference primaries are not elections.Â  They are\r\n  elections and accordingly are subject to state and federal laws concerning the\r\n  electoral process.Â  Nevertheless, they are subject to a different set of\r\n  statutory procedures under our Code than regular primaries.\r\n[6] Chief Justice Pope and Acting Justice Gary simply adopted the order of the\r\n  circuit court, which is not included in the Reporter. Brooks, 80 S.C. at\r\n  448, 61 S.E. at 947.Â  Justice Jones, joined by Justice Woods, agreed that the\r\n  appropriation could suspend the general law, and his vote made this the holding\r\n  of the Court. See id. at 449, 61 S.E. at 947. (Jones, J., concurring in\r\n  part and dissenting in part).Â  His only disagreement was whether the\r\n  appropriation could operate retroactively. Id. at 450, 61 S.E. at 947.\r\n[7] As to the majority's contention that\r\n  we must compare the provisos to section 7-11-20(B)(2) because the latter is\r\n  part of the permanent laws of this State,Â  I believe the Code Commissioner's\r\n  designation as such is of no moment.Â  This subsection, by its very terms, is\r\n  specifically limited to the 2008 election cycle and therefore does not survive\r\n  following that election as posited by the majority.Â  Moreover, contrary\r\n  to the majority's suggestion, I do not believe that section 7-11-20(B) is\r\n  inapplicable in its entirety.Â  Instead, the only portion no longer in effect is\r\n  what is limited to 2008, namely the requirements contained in subsection\r\n  (B)(2).Â  The remainder of the statute remains in effect and grants the\r\n  political parties full authority to conduct the primary.\r\n[8] While the General Assembly did include language in the appropriations bill\r\n  stating conflicting provisions in the general law are suspended, that is\r\n  nothing more than a recognition of the general rule.Â  Nothing in this portion\r\n  of the bill speaks to section 7-11-20(B)(2).Â  Thus, the General Assembly did\r\n  not &quot;expressly provide[] that the temporal limitation in section\r\n  7-11-20(B)(2) must be suspended during the current fiscal year&quot; as the\r\n  majority contends.Â  Rather, the General Assembly merely provided generally that\r\n  to the extent there is any conflict with the provisos, the provisos control.\r\n[9] In light of my resolution of this question, I would not reach the issue of the\r\n  sufficiency of the funds appropriated for the presidential preference\r\n  primary.Â Â  However, if I were to reach it, I would agree with the majority that\r\n  it presents a nonjusticiable political question.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27070","title":"In the Matter of Howard Hammer","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=27070","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court definitely suspends a lawyer from the practice of law for six months.","date":"2011-11-28","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Howard\r\n          Hammer,&nbsp; Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion\r\n  No.Â Â  27070\r\n  Heard\r\n  November 2, 2011 - Filed November 28, 2011 \r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.

his counselor shall file quarterly reports addressing his\r\n  progress with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission); and, an\r\n  Investigative Panel of the Commission may extend the counseling requirement at\r\n  the conclusion of the two (2) year period if it deems it necessary.Â  The facts,\r\n  as set forth in the Agreement and as admitted in argument, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn 2005, respondent and his\r\n  wife separated and, in 2007, became involved in a contentious divorce.Â  Between\r\n  July 2007 and February 2008, respondent was charged with criminal domestic\r\n  violence, two counts of trespassing, second degree burglary, stalking, and\r\n  simple assault.Â  As a result of these arrests, respondent was placed on interim\r\n  suspension.Â  Id.Â  The criminal charges involved matters with\r\n  respondent's former wife and former sister-in-law.Â  \r\nÂ All charges against\r\n  respondent were later dismissed with prejudice and the solicitor issued a\r\n  letter stating that, after thorough and complete investigation, he believed\r\n  that the matters did not rise to the level of criminal wrongdoing and that all\r\n  of the matters should be dealt with by the Family Court.Â  \r\nRespondent denies he\r\n  committed any crimes as alleged by his former wife and former sister-in-law.Â \r\n  However, he admits he could have used better judgment.Â Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nIn 2010, after the criminal\r\n  charges were dismissed, respondent filed a pro se action against\r\n  the City of Columbia alleging false arrest.Â  In the course of representing\r\n  himself in the matter, respondent subpoenaed Witness A, a former neighbor and\r\n  long-time friend of both he and his former wife, to give a deposition.Â  Witness\r\n  A was not a witness to any of the matters out of which the criminal charges\r\n  against respondent arose; however, Witness A had provided an affidavit in\r\n  support of respondent's former wife during the divorce proceeding.Â  Respondent\r\n  also subpoenaed two other former neighbors who had supported his former wife\r\n  during the divorce proceedings.Â  Respondent admits he subpoenaed the three\r\n  witnesses to take their depositions as he believed that they might have\r\n  information regarding the allegations of criminal wrongdoings made by his former\r\n  wife.[1] Â Respondent fails to explain why the\r\n  testimony of any of these witnesses was pertinent to his suit against the\r\n  City.Â  \r\nOver the course of two days,\r\n  respondent deposed Witness A for over five hours, including breaks.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits he asked improper questions during the deposition.Â  He further admits\r\n  that there were times when he talked over the deponent and there were instances\r\n  where he did not let Witness A finish his answer.Â  \r\nIn addition, respondent\r\n  admits he asked a number of improper questions of Witness A.Â  In particular, he\r\n  asked Witness A about his sexual orientation and whether he had been tested for\r\n  HIV.Â  He also asked Witness A whether he had Alzheimer's Disease when the\r\n  witness' recollection was incomplete.Â  Respondent admits the question should\r\n  not have been asked in this fashion.Â  \r\nRespondent regrets and\r\n  apologizes for his questions during the deposition.Â  He submits that the stress\r\n  of his divorce and of deposing a former friend who had sided with his former\r\n  wife in their divorce caused his emotions to get the better of him.Â  \r\nRespondent has since signed\r\n  a Settlement Agreement and Release and Stipulation of Dismissal concluding the\r\n  matter against the City of Columbia and its police department.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that his misconduct\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a) (5)(it shall be ground for discipline for\r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or\r\n  to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct\r\n  demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be\r\n  ground for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office taken to\r\n  practice law in this state)Â  In addition, respondent admits he has violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â \r\n  Rule 4.4(a) (in representing client, lawyer shall not use means that have no\r\n  substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden third person, or\r\n  use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of person),\r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct), and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for\r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and impose a six\r\n  (6) month definite suspension from the practice of law.Â  We decline to impose\r\n  the suspension retroactively, primarily because of respondent's deposition misconduct\r\n  which occurred while he was on interim suspension.Â  Further, respondent shall complete\r\n  the Ethics School portion of the Legal Ethics and Practice Program within one\r\n  (1) year of the date of his reinstatement to the practice of law.Â  \r\nAlthough we accept the Agreement, the\r\n  Court is deeply concerned about respondent's emotional state and his ability to\r\n  execute sound judgment.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As evidenced by the\r\n  facts presented in the Agreement and respondent's testimony during oral\r\n  argument, respondent is obsessed with regaining his reputation in the community\r\n  and with his ex-wife from whom he has been separated and/or divorced for\r\n  approximately six years.Â  Further, during argument, he initially refused to\r\n  accept any responsibility with regard to the instances which led to his several\r\n  arrests and, instead, characterized himself as the victim in each of the\r\n  situations.Â  Consequently, we order respondent to continue psychological counseling for two (2) years,\r\n  require respondent's counselor to file quarterly reports addressing respondent's\r\n  progress with the Commission, and authorize the Investigative Panel of the\r\n  Commission to extend the counseling requirement at the conclusion of the two\r\n  (2) year period if it deems it necessary. \r\n  \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE, HEARN,\r\n  JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent did not depose the two other\r\n  witnesses.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
