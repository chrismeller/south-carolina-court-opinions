however, the board decided to allow Academy until September 28,\r\n  2004, to comply with these conditions.Â   \r\nAcademy did not meet the\r\n  conditions for approval as directed by the District Board and instead filed an\r\n  appeal with the State Board of Education (State Board).Â  Academy also demanded\r\n  from District charter school funding that District had withheld.Â   \r\nThe State Board ruled that\r\n  Academyâ€™s application had been conditionally approved for a charter school with\r\n  only one conditionâ€”an appropriate facilityâ€”and not the four conditions noted by\r\n  the District Board.Â  The State Board concluded that Academy had not met the\r\n  facility condition because the schoolâ€™s facility did not meet the description\r\n  in Academyâ€™s application for a charter school.Â  The State Board therefore\r\n  affirmed the District Boardâ€™s decision.Â   \r\nOn appeal, the circuit court\r\n  concluded that Districtâ€™s conditional approval of Academyâ€™s application did not\r\n  specify that the deadline for compliance was the opening of school.Â  Further,\r\n  when Academy started operating as a school on August 16, it â€œacquired rights\r\n  that triggered the due process provisions of Â§ 59-40-110.â€Â  The court concluded\r\n  these due process rights were violated when the superintendent notified Academy\r\n  on August 17 that it could not operate as a charter school.Â  Finally, the court\r\n  ruled that the facility description set forth in Academyâ€™s application was not\r\n  the standard to determine whether Academy had met the condition for an\r\n  appropriate site.Â  The State Boardâ€™s decision finding no charter school\r\n  contract was therefore reversed.Â   \r\nThe circuit court subsequently held\r\n  an evidentiary hearing and determined that Academy was entitled to damages\r\n  amounting to $259,821.90 for rent reimbursement and student stipends from\r\n  District.Â  District appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Was there a\r\n  due process violation?\r\n\t2.&nbsp; Did a\r\n  contract for a charter school exist?\r\n\t3.&nbsp; Were\r\n  damages properly awarded?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Due process\r\nThe circuit court found Academy had\r\n  acquired â€œcertain rightsâ€ under the conditional charter it received from\r\n  District and therefore Academy was entitled to notice and a hearing before its\r\n  status as a charter school could be terminated.Â  The court concluded Academyâ€™s\r\n  due process rights had been violated.Â  District contends this was error.Â  We agree.\r\nFirst, the Charter School Act specifically\r\n  provides that no rights accrue from a conditional charter.Â  As stated in S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-80 (2004):[2] \r\n \r\n\r\n\tÂ§ 59-40-80. Conditional\r\n  authorization of charter school.\r\n\tA sponsor may\r\n  conditionally authorize a charter school before the applicant has secured its\r\n  space, equipment, facilities, and personnel if the applicant indicates such\r\n  authority is necessary for it to meet the requirements of this chapter.Â  Conditional\r\n    authorization does not give rise to any equitable or other claims based on reliance,\r\n    notwithstanding any promise, parole (sic), written, or otherwise,\r\n      contained in the authorization or acceptance of it, whether preceding or\r\n      following the conditional authorization.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Under this provision, Academy acquired no\r\n  rights based on its conditional charter.Â  This provision ensures that the local\r\n  school district maintains control during the approval process while allowing a\r\n  prospective charter school to receive funding and proceed in setting up its\r\n  operation.  \r\nThe interests protected by the Due\r\n  Process Clause are defined not by the constitution but by independent sources\r\n  such as state law.Â  Lexington County Sch. Dist. One Bd. of\r\n    Trustees v. Boost, 282 S.C. 32, 316 S.E.2d 677 (1984) (citing Board\r\n      of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972)).Â  Here, state law provides that\r\n  the conditional authorization of a charter school creates no rights in the\r\n  applicant.Â  Accordingly, there are no due process rights implicated in the\r\n  termination of a conditional charter.  \r\nMoreover, any lack of due process was remedied by\r\n  the evidentiary hearing before the District Board when the District Board gave\r\n  Academy additional time to comply.Â  See Ross v. Med. Univ. of South Carolina, 328 S.C.51, 492 S.E.2d 62 (1997) (state may cure procedural\r\n  deprivation of due process rights by later procedural remedy).Â  In conclusion,\r\n  there was no deprivation of due process and the circuit court erred in so\r\n  finding.Â   \r\n2.Â \r\n  Conditions for approval\r\nThe circuit court found that the\r\n  facility description in Academyâ€™s application was not the standard to determine\r\n  if Academy had complied with the facility requirement.Â  The court held it was\r\n  â€œarbitrary and capriciousâ€ to hold Academy to the terms of its application\r\n  which was â€œcompleted many months prior to the schoolâ€™s opening [when] there\r\n  were many unknown variablesâ€¦.â€Â  The circuit court found a binding charter\r\n  existed.Â  District contends this was error.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Charter School Act provides\r\n  that â€œthe charter school application shall be a proposed contractâ€ and\r\n  it must include certain terms, including a description of the facility.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-60(F)(10) (2004) (emphasis added).Â  The terms of an approved\r\n  charter application become the terms of the agreement between the parties. Â§ 59-40-60(A).Â  A material revision of the terms of the\r\n  agreement requires the approval of both parties.Â  Â§ 59-40-60(C).\r\nThis statutory language clearly\r\n  envisions the charter schoolâ€™s fulfillment of the terms of its application as a\r\n  contractual obligation.Â  Â Â Here, Academy never sought to amend its\r\n  application.Â  It is uncontested that Academyâ€™s facility did not meet the terms\r\n  set forth in Academyâ€™s application and the facility was never approved by\r\n  District.Â  The application described a facility with approximately 25,000\r\n  square feet, a minimum of fourteen classrooms, a science lab, computer lab,\r\n  cafeteria, administration offices, a main office, a multi-purpose room, and\r\n  restrooms.Â  Academyâ€™s facility is 6,700 square feet and has none of the\r\n  requisite rooms except for restrooms.Â   \r\nWe find the circuit court erred in\r\n  ignoring the requirements of the Charter School Act and ruling that Academy was\r\n  not required to meet the terms set forth in its application.Â  Under the Charter\r\n  School Act, no charter existed and Academy was not operating as a charter\r\n  school.\r\n3.Â \r\n  Damages hearing\r\nAfter finding a binding contract,\r\n  the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing over Districtâ€™s objection and\r\n  awarded damages to Academy.Â  District contends the circuit court had no\r\n  authority to hold a hearing on damages while sitting as an appellate court in\r\n  this administrative appeal.Â  We agree.Â  The circuit court heard this case on\r\n  appeal from the State Board, a state agency.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-310(2) (2005) (â€œAgencyâ€ means each state board).Â  Review of a state agency\r\n  decision is confined to the record.Â  Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (2005).[3]Â \r\n  The circuit court clearly exceeded its authority in holding an evidentiary\r\n  hearing on the issue of damages.\r\nMoreover, as discussed above, a contract for a\r\n  charter school did not exist.Â  Damages should not have been awarded since\r\n  District was not obligated to fund the school.Â  Accordingly, the decision of\r\n  the circuit court is  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Academy also received a $20,000 planning grant and a\r\n  $200,000 start-up grant from the State Department of Education to fund the\r\n  school.\r\n[2] The Charter School Act was subsequently amended in\r\n  2006.Â  This section has remained substantially the same.  \r\n[3] This section was subsequently amended in 2006 and the\r\n  subsection was re-numbered.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26429","title":"Moore v.

We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn October 1, 2006,\r\n  officers with the Mount Pleasant Police Department were summoned to the Mooresâ€™ home after 911 personnel received a call from the Mooresâ€™ fifteen-year-old son.Â \r\n  The partiesâ€™ son reported that Husband had become physically abusive with him\r\n  and his mother and threatened them with a weapon.Â  Police arrested Husband and\r\n  charged him with criminal domestic violence (CDV).Â  The next day, Husband was\r\n  released on bond and ordered not to go near the Mooresâ€™ residence.Â  Â According\r\n  to Wife, Husband drove by the residence and at one point entered the yard to\r\n  remove several items.Â  On October 3, 2006, Wife filed an action pursuant to\r\n  section 20-4-50[1] of the\r\n  â€œProtection from Domestic Abuse Actâ€ (the Act) requesting an emergency hearing\r\n  and an Order of Protection against Husband.Â  At 7:50 p.m. on October 4, 2006,\r\n  Husband was served in Sumter with a summons to appear for an emergency hearing\r\n  scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on October 5, 2006, in Charleston.\r\nAt the hearing,\r\n  Husband and Wife both appeared without counsel.Â  Initially, the family court\r\n  judge inquired whether Wife wanted a continuance in order to obtain counsel.Â \r\n  Wife declined, stating that she wanted to obtain an immediate restraining order\r\n  against Husband.Â  When Husband requested a continuance so that he could obtain\r\n  counsel, the judge denied the request, and stated â€œ[t]his is an Emergency\r\n  Hearing, [Wife] doesnâ€™t want to continue this case, we got to go forward\r\n  today.â€Â  Throughout the proceeding, Husband reluctantly responded to the\r\n  judgeâ€™s questions and indicated that he did not want to proceed without the\r\n  assistance of counsel.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  hearing Wifeâ€™s testimony and questioning the parties, the judge found Husband\r\n  had abused Wife and their son.Â  As a result, the judge issued an Order of\r\n  Protection which, inter alia:Â  restrained Husband from committing any\r\n  further abuse or from having any contact with Wife and the partiesâ€™ two minor\r\n  children; awarded Wife temporary custody of the partiesâ€™ children; ordered\r\n  Husband to pay temporary child and spousal support; and awarded Wife temporary\r\n  possession of the marital home.Â  In addition to ordering CDV counseling and\r\n  invoking the assistance of the Department of Social Services for the minor\r\n  children, the judge also ordered Husband to relinquish any weapons in his\r\n  possession to the Charleston County Sheriffâ€™s Department until further order of\r\n  the family court. \r\nOn October 13,\r\n  2006, Husband, who was then represented by counsel, filed a motion for\r\n  reconsideration.Â  The family court judge held a hearing on the motion.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, Husbandâ€™s counsel alleged the issuance of the order violated due\r\n  process and denied him equal protection based on the following grounds:Â  (1)\r\n  Husband did not receive â€œample notice and an opportunity to answer [Wifeâ€™s]\r\n  chargesâ€ with the assistance of counsel; and (2) Husbandâ€™s request for a\r\n  continuance was denied whereas Wife was offered a continuance to retain\r\n  counsel.Â  In making these arguments, Husbandâ€™s counsel claimed the order,\r\n  specifically the finding of physical abuse, was a final order which could have\r\n  future ramifications on Husbandâ€™s employment and his right to possess weapons.Â \r\n  Husband also characterized the proceeding under section 20-4-50(a) as\r\n  â€œquasi-criminalâ€ because â€œit takes away any citizenâ€™s rights without due\r\n  process without a full trial.â€ Â Based on these arguments, Husbandâ€™s counsel\r\n  requested a full hearing on the merits.Â  Counsel, however, recognized that a\r\n  Temporary Restraining Order could be granted to protect Wife until a final\r\n  resolution was reached on all of the issues.Â  \r\nBy order dated\r\n  December 15, 2006, the family court denied Husbandâ€™s motion for\r\n  reconsideration.Â  The court found Husbandâ€™s due process rights were not\r\n  violated by the short-time frame preceding the emergency hearing given the\r\n  statute specifically permitted the court to conduct the hearing within\r\n  twenty-four hours after Wifeâ€™s petition was served.Â  Additionally, the court\r\n  held the denial of Husbandâ€™s motion for a continuance did not violate due\r\n  process because the statute was intended to protect the alleged victim of\r\n  domestic abuse.Â  Because Wife chose to proceed with the hearing, the court\r\n  believed that allowing Husband to delay the hearing â€œwould defeat the clear\r\n  legislative intent of the statute which is to provide alleged victims of abuse\r\n  immediate access to the Court for orders of protection.â€Â  Finally, the court\r\n  found Husbandâ€™s equal protection claim to be without merit.Â  Relying on the\r\n  terms of the statute, the court found the â€œAct affords protection for males,\r\n  females and minor children alike.â€Â  The court believed that the emergency\r\n  hearing would not have been conducted differently â€œif the sexes of the parties\r\n  were switched.â€Â  Subsequently, Husband filed this appeal.\r\nI.&nbsp; DUE PROCESS\r\nHusband\r\n  challenges the issuance of the family courtâ€™s order on two due process\r\n  grounds.Â  Given the permanency and collateral consequences inherent in a\r\n  finding of physical abuse, Husband first contends the provision of section\r\n  20-4-50 which permits a hearing within twenty-four hours of the service of the\r\n  petition violates due process.Â  As a second ground, Husband asserts the family\r\n  courtâ€™s denial of his motion for a continuance constituted an abuse of\r\n  discretion and violated his right to due process.Â  Specifically, he claims the\r\n  short notice and denial of a continuance prohibited him from procuring counsel.\r\nAlthough\r\n  Husband does not differentiate in his argument between substantive and\r\n  procedural due process, we believe both are implicated in the issues he raises\r\n  on appeal.Â  Accordingly, both are addressed in our analysis.\r\nNo\r\n  person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of\r\n  law.Â  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.Â  â€œIn order to prove\r\n  a denial of substantive due process, a party must show that he was arbitrarily\r\n  and capriciously deprived of a cognizable property interest rooted in state\r\n  law.â€Â  Sloan v. S.C.

City of Myrtle Beach, 372 S.C.\r\n  230, 235, 642 S.E.2d 565, 567 (2007).\r\nIn Sloan\r\n  v. South Carolina Board of Physical Therapy Examiners, this Court explained:\r\n\r\n\tProcedural\r\n  due process requirements are not technical; no particular form of procedure is\r\n  necessary.Â  In re Vora, 354 S.C. at 595, 582 S.E.2d at 416.Â  â€œ[D]ue\r\n  process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular\r\n  situation demands.â€ Wilson, 352 S.C. at 452, 574 S.E.2d at 733 (quoting \r\n\tMorrissey\r\n    v.

Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Wilson, 352 S.C. 445, 452, 574 S.E.2d 730, 734 (2002) (quoting Brown v.\r\n      S.C. State Bd. of Educ., 301 S.C. 326, 329, 391 S.E.2d 866, 867 (1990)).\r\nApplying the\r\n  above-outlined analysis to the facts of the instant case, we find Husbandâ€™s\r\n  substantive due process rights were implicated by the proceedings established\r\n  in section 20-4-50.Â  See State ex rel. Williams v. Marsh, 626\r\n  S.W.2d 223, 230 (Mo. 1982)(en banc) (finding property and liberty\r\n  interests of respondent to a petition for order of protection are implicated\r\n  and protection of procedural due process is appropriate).Â  Specifically,\r\n  Husbandâ€™s constitutionally protected liberty and property interests are subject\r\n  to temporary deprivation as a result of the issuance of an Order of\r\n  Protection.Â  Once the order is issued Husband, i.e., a respondent to a\r\n  petition, is subject to:Â  the immediate loss of his children; reduction in his\r\n  financial resources if child/spousal support is ordered; and immediate loss of\r\n  possession of the marital residence.[2]Â  Husband also immediately becomes subject to criminal prosecution\r\n  or contempt proceedings if he violates the Order of Protection.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Husband is required to immediately relinquish any weapons in his possession or\r\n  be subject to federal prosecution pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. Â§ 922.[3]Â  If Husband is employed in law enforcement, the inability to\r\n  possess a weapon may impact his ability to perform his job.[4]Â  \r\nSignificantly, not\r\n  only is Husband subject to immediate deprivation of constitutionally protected\r\n  interests, he may also suffer future ramifications as a consequence of the\r\n  issuance of the Order of Protection.Â  The factual finding of physical abuse may\r\n  have a long-term impact on both marital and civil litigation.Â  In terms of\r\n  marital litigation, a definitive finding of physical abuse could be used by\r\n  Wife in the following respects:Â  a ground for divorce (physical cruelty); the\r\n  award of custody; a fault factor for the award of alimony; and a factor to be\r\n  taken into consideration for the equitable apportionment of the marital\r\n  assets.Â  Furthermore, a factual finding of physical abuse could potentially be\r\n  used in a civil claim by Wife for recovery of actual or punitive damages caused\r\n  by the physical abuse.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-130 (1985)(â€œAny\r\n  proceeding under [the chapter regarding the protection from domestic abuse] is\r\n  in addition to other civil and criminal remedies.â€). Â Because Husbandâ€™s\r\n  constitutionally protected interests in liberty and property are implicated by\r\n  the issuance of the Order of Protection, procedural due process protection\r\n  should be afforded to Husband, i.e., a respondent to a petition.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  due process protection is applicable in this situation, it is not without\r\n  limitation. Â Nor are a respondentâ€™s interests paramount to the Stateâ€™s interest\r\n  in protecting a petitioner or other household members from domestic abuse.Â  In\r\n  view of these competing interests, it is necessary for this Court to balance these\r\n  interests to determine the extent and nature of applicable due process\r\n  procedures.Â  See Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 167-68 (1974) (noting extent and nature of due process procedures depends upon weighing\r\n  of the private interests affected and the related government functions).Â  In doing\r\n  so, we are guided by the intent of the Legislature in promulgating the Act,\r\n  particularly section 20-4-50.Â  \r\n\r\n\tCommentators\r\n  have observed:\r\n\tThe Protection from Domestic Abuse Act was enacted to deal with\r\n  the problem of abuse between family members.Â  The effect of the Act was to\r\n  bring the parties before a judge as quickly as possible to prevent further\r\n  violence.Â  Speedy access to the courts also [minimizes] the disruption to any\r\n  children of the parties since the family court may order payment of temporary\r\n  financial support.Â  By expediting the provision of child support, the Act helps\r\n  prevent the abused spouse from returning to her abuser based on financial\r\n  reasons.\r\n\r\n17 S.C. Jur. Criminal\r\n  Domestic Violence, Â§ 14 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nWe agree\r\n  with this commentary, and believe the Legislature properly effectuated the\r\n  above goal by creating a statutory scheme that permits expedited proceedings\r\n  within twenty-four hours from service of the petition before either the family\r\n  court or, if necessary, before a magistrate who may grant a limited temporary\r\n  restraining order.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 20-4-30(A) (Supp. 2006) (â€œThe family\r\n  court has jurisdiction over all proceedings under this chapter except that,\r\n  during nonbusiness hours or at other times when the court is not in session,\r\n  the petition may be filed with a magistrate. Â The magistrate may issue an order\r\n  of protection granting only the relief provided by Section 20-4-60(a)(1).â€).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  by providing a respondent with notice of a petition prior to the hearing and an\r\n  opportunity to be heard, section 20-4-20 complies with the requisite procedural\r\n  due process guarantees.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-20(f) (Supp. 2006)\r\n  (â€œâ€˜Order of protectionâ€™ means an order of protection issued to protect the\r\n  petitioner or minor household members from the abuse of another household\r\n  member where the respondent has received notice of the proceedings and has\r\n    an opportunity to be heard.â€)(emphasis added).Â  Here, Husband was provided\r\n  notice of the hearing and given an opportunity to actively participate in terms\r\n  of questioning Wife and answering the courtâ€™s questions.Â  Husband, however,\r\n  chose not to participate in the hearing and, thus, failed to take advantage of\r\n  the procedural safeguards established by the Act.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  given that relief awarded in an Order of Protection is temporary and\r\n  potentially modifiable, the procedure established by the Legislature is\r\n  sufficient to comply with procedural due process.Â  Finally, as evident in this\r\n  case, a respondent may obtain counsel after the hearing in order to move for\r\n  reconsideration or seek modification of certain relief awarded to petitioner.Â  See State ex rel. Williams v. Marsh, 626 S.W.2d 223, 230 (MO 1982)(en banc) (â€œNotice and an opportunity to be heard must be provided by the\r\n  state in a meaningful manner prior to deprivation of a protected interest.Â \r\n  This rule is not necessarily applied when there is a temporary taking, as is\r\n  the case here.Â  Due process is a flexible concept.â€) (citations omitted); see\r\n    also State v. Doe, 765 A.2d 518, 523-29 (Conn. Super. Ct. 2000) (concluding defendant had not been prejudiced by issuance of initial protective\r\n  order without an attorney where he had the order modified with the aid of\r\n  counsel).Â  \r\nNotably, appellate\r\n  courts from other jurisdictions have held that statutes similar to this stateâ€™s\r\n  Protection from Domestic Abuse Act are not violative of due process.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Paschal v. Hazlinsky, 803 So. 2d 413, 417-19 (La. Ct. App.\r\n  2001) (holding no due process violation with respect to hearings for protective\r\n  orders against domestic abuse); Kampf v. Kampf, 603 N.W.2d 295, 299\r\n  (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (concluding Wifeâ€™s obtaining personal protection order\r\n  without notice to Husband did not violate his procedural due process rights); Baker\r\n    v. Baker, 494 N.W.2d 282, 288-89 n.9 (Minn. 1992), superseded in part by\r\n      statute in Burkstrand v. Burkstrand, 632 N.W.2d 206 (Minn. 2001)\r\n  (relying on guidance of cases from other jurisdictions and finding ex parte\r\n  procedures of Domestic Abuse Act comply with applicable rules as well as due\r\n  process); Schramek v. Bohren, 429 N.W.2d 501, 503-05 (Wisc. Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (finding spousal abuse statute was not unconstitutional).\r\nEven\r\n  though Husbandâ€™s procedural due process rights were not violated by the\r\n  short-time period between service of the petition and the hearing or Husbandâ€™s\r\n  inability to procure counsel for the emergency hearing, we are concerned that a\r\n  factual finding of physical abuse was finally adjudicated at this emergency\r\n  hearing.Â  \r\nWithout\r\n  question, the immediate protection of potential victims from domestic abuse is\r\n  a legitimate government interest which requires a prompt hearing and issuance\r\n  of a temporary order if the evidence necessitates.Â  However, we believe a definitive\r\n  factual finding of physical abuse for a temporary Order of Protection is not\r\n  only improper under the terms of the statute, but is also unnecessary to\r\n  satisfy the governmentâ€™s interest.Â  In our view, the Legislature provided for\r\n  an emergency hearing, for the benefit of victims of domestic violence and did\r\n  not intend for these protections to establish collateral consequences for the\r\n  alleged abuser.Â  Cf. State v. Dispoto, 913 A.2d 791, 798\r\n  (N.J. 2007) (stating â€œthe remedial protections afforded under the [New Jersey\r\n  Protection of Domestic Violence Act] are intended for the benefit of victims of\r\n  domestic violence and are not meant to serve as a pretext for obtaining\r\n  information to advance a criminal investigation against an alleged abuserâ€).Â \r\n  Instead, we believe the Legislature intended for the findings, which result\r\n  from an emergency hearing pursuant to section 20-4-50(a), to be temporary and\r\n  confined to the Order of Protection.Â  Implicit in this conclusion is that these\r\n  findings cannot be used in future litigation unless they are confirmed in a\r\n  subsequent hearing on the merits.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching this conclusion, we need look no further than the terms of the Act.Â  See Beattie v. Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 319 S.C. 449, 452, 462\r\n  S.E.2d 276, 278 (1995) (recognizing that in interpreting a statute, our primary\r\n  purpose is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature); Id. (â€œâ€˜A statute as a whole must receive a\r\n  practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose,\r\n  design, and policy of the lawmakers.â€™â€ (quoting Browning v. Hartvigsen,\r\n  307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992))).Â  Specifically, we focus our\r\n  analysis on the procedural prerequisites for petitioning for an emergency\r\n  hearing as well as the proof required for the issuance of an Order of\r\n  Protection.\r\nIn\r\n  terms of procedure, it is significant to note that the Petition for an Order of\r\n  Protection â€œmust inform the respondent of the right to retain counsel.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-40(c) (Supp. 2006).Â  We interpret this requirement to mean\r\n  that the Legislature intended for a respondent to have a meaningful opportunity\r\n  to retain counsel in order to participate in a hearing conducted pursuant to\r\n  the Act.Â  Because section 20-4-50(a) authorizes a family court to conduct an\r\n  emergency hearing â€œ[w]ithin twenty-four hours after service of a petition,â€ it\r\n  would be nonsensical to believe that a respondent would be able to retain\r\n  counsel and prepare for an adjudicative hearing within such a limited time\r\n  frame.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-50(a) (Supp. 2006).Â  A strict reading of this\r\n  statutory provision would mean that an emergency hearing could be conducted\r\n  within mere hours of when a respondent was served with the petition.Â  Clearly,\r\n  we do not believe the Legislature intended for this result.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we glean additional support for our interpretation by comparing a related\r\n  provision of section 20-4-50 with the above-quoted provision.Â  Subsection (b)\r\n  of this statute provides:\r\n\r\n\tIf the court denies the motion for a twenty-four-hour hearing or\r\n  such a hearing is not requested, the petitioner may request and the court must\r\n  grant a hearing within fifteen days of the filing of a petition.Â  The court\r\n  must cause a copy of the petition to be served upon the respondent at least five\r\n  days prior to the hearing, except as provided in subsection (a), in the same\r\n  manner required for service in the circuit courts.Â  Where service is not\r\n  accomplished five days prior to the hearing, the respondent, upon his motion,\r\n  is entitled to a continuance until such time is necessary to provide for\r\n  compliance with this section.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-50(b)\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â Â  The significant difference between the procedures employed in\r\n  each of the subsections is that the respondent is given a minimum of five days\r\n  to obtain counsel and prepare for the hearing and may be granted a continuance\r\n  if the five days are not provided under subsection (b), whereas there is no\r\n  mention of a continuance if an emergency hearing is conducted under subsection\r\n  (a).Â  Â Given that a respondent is not given a meaningful opportunity to retain\r\n  counsel and prepare if a twenty-four-hour emergency hearing is requested and\r\n  conducted, we conclude the Legislature intended for the emergency hearing to be\r\n  temporary in nature.Â  Inferentially, a hearing conducted pursuant to section\r\n  20-4-50(b), which provides a respondent an extended period of time in which to\r\n  retain counsel and prepare his or her case, should be viewed as an adjudicative\r\n  hearing on the merits of the action.\r\nA\r\n  review of the proof required for the issuance of an Order of Protection\r\n  solidifies our conclusion that an order issued pursuant to a twenty-four-hour\r\n  emergency hearing is intended to be temporary and not a final determination.Â  For\r\n  a court to issue an Order of Protection after an emergency hearing, a\r\n  petitioner must prove â€œthe allegation of abuse by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-50(a)(Supp. 2006).Â  The statute further provides\r\n  that â€œ[a] prima facie showing of immediate and present danger of bodily injury,\r\n  which may be verified by supporting affidavits, constitutes good cause for\r\n  purposes of this section.â€Â  Id.Â  A review of these statutory\r\n  prerequisites reveals that a definitive finding of physical abuse is not\r\n  essential.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the Act defines â€œabuseâ€ to include â€œphysical abuse,â€ â€œbodily injury,â€ and\r\n  â€œassault,â€ it also recognizes that â€œthe threat of physical harmâ€ is sufficient\r\n  to constitute a basis for the issuance of an Order of Protection as the result\r\n  of an emergency hearing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-20(a)(1) (1985 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  Furthermore, in our opinion, a showing of â€œimmediate and present danger\r\n  of bodily injuryâ€ denotes that the threat of a future occurrence provides the\r\n  basis for an Order of Protection and, thus, a definitive finding of physical abuse\r\n  is not mandated.Â  Finally, we note that this type of finding would be\r\n  sufficient to satisfy the provision of 18 U.S.C.A. Â§ 922(g)(8)(C)(i), which\r\n  only requires â€œa finding that such person represents a\r\n  credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child.â€Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we hold that an Order of Protection issued pursuant to an\r\n  emergency hearing is temporary and that a hearing on the merits of the action\r\n  should, if necessary, be conducted by the family court at a later date. [5] Â This procedure would then enable a petitioner and a respondent\r\n  to procure counsel in order to actively and thoroughly participate in an\r\n  adjudicative hearing on the merits of the action. [6]\r\nII.&nbsp; EQUAL PROTECTION\r\nFinally,\r\n  Husband claims the family court engaged in â€œinvidious gender discriminationâ€ by\r\n  denying his motion for a continuance but offering Wife a continuance in order\r\n  to provide her with more time to prepare or seek counsel.\r\nAs\r\n  we understand this argument, Husband is primarily challenging the family\r\n  courtâ€™s decision not to grant a continuance as opposed to positing an argument\r\n  that the Act violates the Equal Protection Clause.Â  Thus, this argument is not in\r\n  actuality an equal protection challenge.Â  However, to the extent Husbandâ€™s\r\n  argument can be construed as such a challenge, we find this issue is without\r\n  merit.\r\nThe Equal Protection Clauses of our federal\r\n  and state constitutions declare that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.Â  U.S.\r\n  Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.Â  Equal protection requires\r\n  â€œall persons to be treated alike under like circumstances and conditions, both\r\n  in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed.â€Â  GTE Sprint Commcâ€™ns Corp.\r\n    v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of South Carolina, 288 S.C. 174, 181, 341 S.E.2d 126,\r\n  129 (1986). Â â€œCourts\r\n  generally analyze equal protection challenges under one of three standards: (1)\r\n  rational basis; (2) intermediate scrutiny; or, (3) strict scrutiny.â€ Denene,\r\n    Inc. v. City of Charleston, 359 S.C. 85, 91, 596 S.E.2d 917, 920 (2004).Â \r\n  â€œGender-based classifications are not inherently suspect so as to be subject to\r\n  strict scrutiny and will be upheld if they bear a fair and substantial\r\n  relationship to legitimate state ends.â€ In the Interest of Joseph T.,\r\n  312 S.C. 15, 16, 430 S.E.2d 523, 524 (1993).Â  â€œFor a gender-based\r\n  classification to pass constitutional muster, it must serve an important\r\n  governmental objective and be substantially related to the achievement of that\r\n  objective.â€Â  State v. Wright, 349 S.C. 310, 313, 563 S.E.2d 311, 312\r\n  (2002)(citing Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976)).Â  â€œA law will be\r\n  upheld where the gender classification realistically reflects the fact that the\r\n  sexes are not similarly situated in certain circumstances.â€ Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the family court judge did not base her decision on gender,\r\n  but rather on the respective posture of the parties, i.e., that Wife was\r\n  the â€œpetitionerâ€ and had the burden of establishing the need for an Order of Protection.Â \r\n  As defined by section 20-4-20, a â€œâ€˜[p]etitionerâ€™ means the person alleging abuse in a petition for an order of protection.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-4-20(d) (1985) (emphasis added).Â  A review of the quoted text as well the\r\n  rest of the definitional section of the Act, reveals that the statute clearly utilizes\r\n  the word â€œperson,â€ a non-gender specific term, to define the parties to an\r\n  action for an Order of Protection. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-20(b), (d), &amp; (e)\r\n  (1985). Â Thus, there is no gender-based classification that would implicate a\r\n  violation of the Equal Protection Clause.Â  See State v. Doe,\r\n  765 A.2d 518, 523-27 (Conn. Super. Ct. 2000) (holding statutory classification\r\n  of victim and a defendant involved in issuance of a protective order did not\r\n  violate defendantâ€™s equal protection rights).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  to the extent Husband attacks the family courtâ€™s decision to deny his motion\r\n  for a continuance, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion.Â  See Bridwell v. Bridwell, 279 S.C. 111, 112, 302 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1983)\r\n  (stating the grant or denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial judge and is reviewable on appeal only when an abuse of discretion\r\n  appears from the record).Â  Because, as previously discussed, Husband was\r\n  provided with procedural due process at the hearing, we disagree with Husbandâ€™s\r\n  contention that he was entitled to a continuance.Â  Moreover, Husband\r\n  subsequently retained counsel and was permitted to move for reconsideration of\r\n  the order.Â  Accordingly, Husband was not prejudiced by going forward with the\r\n  emergency hearing. Townsend v. Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 313, 474 S.E.2d\r\n  424, 427 (1996) (finding appellate court will not set aside a courtâ€™s ruling on\r\n  a motion for a continuance unless it clearly appears there was an abuse of\r\n  discretion to the prejudice of the movant).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Husband was provided procedural due process prior to the\r\n  issuance of the Order of Protection, we affirm the decision of the family\r\n  court.Â  However, we find that an Order of Protection issued pursuant to an\r\n  emergency hearing is temporary and does not represent a final adjudication of\r\n  the merits of the action.Â  Applying our decision to the instant case, we hold\r\n  the finding of physical abuse was not a final adjudication and, therefore,\r\n  should not be used against Husband in future litigation.Â  Finally, we find\r\n  neither the Act nor the family courtâ€™s decision denying Husband a continuance\r\n  constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Ernest Kinard, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Section\r\n  20-4-50 provides:Â   \r\n\r\n\ta) Within twenty-four\r\n  hours after service of a petition under this chapter upon the respondent, the\r\n  court may, for good cause shown, hold an emergency hearing and issue an order\r\n  of protection if the petitioner proves the allegation of abuse by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  A prima facie showing of immediate and present\r\n  danger of bodily injury, which may be verified by supporting affidavits,\r\n  constitutes good cause for purposes of this section.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Ballard, PA, of West Columbia, for\r\n  respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any\r\n  sanction in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  She requests that any suspension\r\n  or disbarment be made retroactive to the date of her interim suspension,\r\n  February 26, 2007.Â  In the Matter of Evans, 372 S.C. 254, 642 S.E.2d 578\r\n  (2007).Â  In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs incurred by ODC and\r\n  the Commission on Lawyer Conduct in investigating this matter. We accept the\r\n  agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state,\r\n  retroactive to the date of her interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in\r\n  the agreement, are as follows.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondentâ€™s\r\n  misconduct stems from her failure to understand the business operations of her\r\n  legal practice and her failure to manager her staff.Â  Respondent admits not\r\n  performing monthly reconciliations as required by Rule 417, SCACR, and, as a\r\n  consequence of that failure, having individual client accounts with a shortage\r\n  of funds that went undetected for months.Â   \r\nIn particular, respondent\r\n  admits she had several accounts that were short of funds after loans closings.Â \r\n  In one instance, she permitted a refinance equity line closing to take place\r\n  where the borrower received $150,000.00 in funds although respondent had not\r\n  received the funds from the lender.Â  This error was carried on respondentâ€™s\r\n  account until brought to her attention by her title insurance companyâ€™s audit\r\n  more than one year after the closing.Â  Respondent required seven months to\r\n  recover the funds from the borrower.Â  Respondent admits she failed in her\r\n  responsibilities in this closing.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nIn another loan closing,\r\n  respondent admits she disbursed approximately $21,000.00 without confirming the\r\n  funds had been wired to her account.Â  In this matter, respondent has not\r\n  recovered the funds from the borrower and respondent has replaced the disbursed\r\n  funds with her own personal funds.Â  Respondent admits she carried the resulting\r\n  $21,000.00 deficit in her trust account for approximately two years after the\r\n  closing.Â  Respondent admits she failed in her responsibilities as attorney in\r\n  this closing.Â   \r\nRespondent admits she did\r\n  not understand the financial aspects of her business and, therefore, hired an\r\n  accountant to manage the financial aspects of her practice.Â  While the\r\n  accountant did perform recordkeeping and reconciliations, respondent now\r\n  recognizes that the reconciliations were inaccurate, incomplete, and did not\r\n  come close to meeting the requirements imposed by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits she did not review the accountantâ€™s trust account reconciliations.[2]  \r\nRespondent admits that, at\r\n  the time of the initial complaint, she had an outstanding balance due to her\r\n  title insurance company of $60,000.00.Â  Respondent had failed to hold in trust\r\n  the title insurance premiums that were collected by her at closings.Â  Respondentâ€™s\r\n  practice with the title insurance premiums had been to deposit the premiums\r\n  when collected at closings into a bank account titled â€œK.C.E. Title.â€Â \r\n  Respondent admits that the balance in the K.C.E. Title account was between\r\n  $3,000.00 and $5,000.00 when it should have been sufficient to pay the\r\n  outstanding amount due the title insurance company.Â   \r\nRespondent admits she\r\n  transferred funds from the K.C.E. Title account to bank accounts out of state\r\n  for personal reasons, including payment of her personal mortgage.Â  She states\r\n  the title insurance company has been paid from monies from the out of state\r\n  accounts.Â   \r\nFurther, respondent admits\r\n  she wired personal mortgage payments from her trust account on four occasions.Â \r\n  She claims this was done in error and that she discovered the error a month and\r\n  one half later when she received the bank statement.Â  Respondent admits that\r\n  she did not have any of her own money in the trust account.Â  She states the\r\n  monies have since been paid back to the trust account.Â Â   \r\nAdditionally, respondent\r\n  admits she relied on her staff to handle day to day affairs, including office\r\n  accounting and document preparation, and that she did not adequately supervise\r\n  her staff.Â  Respondent permitted staff members to sign her name as attorney to\r\n  closing documents and, at the same time, sign as witness to respondentâ€™s â€œsignature.â€Â  \r\n \r\nFinally, respondent admits\r\n  she failed to make timely payments to her employeesâ€™ 401K accounts after\r\n  withholding the funds from the employeesâ€™ paychecks.Â  Further, respondent\r\n  admits that she added the funds to the employeesâ€™ 401K accounts in October\r\n  2007, eight months after her interim suspension.Â  Respondent agrees that she\r\n  failed to safeguard her employeesâ€™ funds, some of which were collected from her\r\n  employees in early 2006.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by her\r\n  misconduct, she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer \r\nshall act with reasonable diligence and promptness\r\n    in representing a client); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold\r\n  property of clients and third persons in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection\r\n  with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 5.3 (partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts\r\n    to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that\r\n    a non-lawyer employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations\r\n    of the lawyer); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct\r\n  for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Â \r\nRespondent further admits her\r\n  misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  In addition, respondent admits her\r\n  misconduct violated Rule 417, SCACR.Â   \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  The disbarment shall be retroactive to the\r\n  date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date\r\n  of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC and the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct as a result of the investigation in this matter.Â  Within\r\n  fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30 of\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender her Certificate of Admission to the\r\n  Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.  \r\nIn addition, should it be determined\r\n  that any restitution remains outstanding, ODC and respondent shall file a\r\n  restitution plan with the Court within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion.Â \r\n  In the plan, respondent shall agree to pay restitution to all clients, banks,\r\n  and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of her\r\n  misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Moreover, in the restitution plan,\r\n  respondent shall agree to reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection for\r\n  any claims paid as a result of her misconduct in connection with this matter.Â \r\n \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent admits that, while she understood the\r\n  HUD-1 Settlement Statement, she did not understand that the funds shown on the\r\n  balance sheet had not been received.Â   \r\n[2] Since her interim suspension, respondent has\r\n  made efforts to have the accounts reconciled and to bring the client accounts\r\n  into balance.Â  It is believed there is a surplus of funds in the accounts at\r\n  this time.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

7(b), RJDE,\r\n  Rule 502, SCACR.[1]Â \r\n  The facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1999 and 2006, the Chief Justice of\r\n  the Supreme Court of South Carolina issued orders which set forth specific\r\n  requirements for financial accounting in all magistrate courts in this State.Â \r\n  Respondent attended training concerning the requirements of the orders but\r\n  knowingly did not comply with them in at least one or more of the following:Â \r\n  1) respondent failed to insure that deposits were made as required by the\r\n  orders and 2) respondent failed to insure that the accounts were reconciled\r\n  monthly as required by the orders.Â  \r\nOn or about February 5, 2007, the Chief\r\n  Magistrate of Jasper County, Sydney McDonald, requested by e-mail that all\r\n  magistrates bring their bank reconciliation paperwork for the months of\r\n  October, November, and December 2006 to the quarterly meeting to be held on or\r\n  about February 8, 2007.Â  Respondent appeared at the meeting but brought only\r\n  daily deposit paperwork.Â  Chief Magistrate McDonald informed respondent that he\r\n  did not bring the correct papers and he could supply the original bank\r\n  statements if the reconciliations would not print.Â  \r\nThat evening, respondent returned to his\r\n  office to obtain the original bank statements.Â  On or about the morning of\r\n  Friday, February 9, 2007, respondent asked his secretary to print out monthly\r\n  balance reports for the last quarter of 2006 and January 2007.Â  For unrelated\r\n  reasons, respondentâ€™s secretary quit the same day.Â  \r\nOn or about Sunday, February 11, 2007,\r\n  respondent requested a meeting with Chief Magistrate McDonald to discuss his\r\n  secretary and money.Â  Chief Magistrate McDonald met with respondent at the\r\n  Ridgelandâ€™s Magistrateâ€™s Office at approximately 5:00 p.m.Â  Respondent was in\r\n  possession of a bank bag containing checks and a bag of mail that had not been\r\n  filed.Â  \r\nDuring the meeting, Chief Magistrate\r\n  McDonald discovered no deposits had been made by respondent for the month of\r\n  January 2007.Â  Respondent informed the Chief Magistrate that his secretary had\r\n  quit and that he believed she had taken cash because there was none in the bank\r\n  bag with the checks and because no money had been deposited in the bank during\r\n  the month of January 2007.Â  Chief Magistrate McDonald asked respondent if he\r\n  had been conducting the reconciliations required by the Chief Justiceâ€™s\r\n  orders.Â  Respondent stated he had been doing so for each and every month and that\r\n  he had initialed the bank statements to so indicate. \r\nLater, however, when examining the bag\r\n  of mail respondent had brought to the meeting, an unopened bank statement from\r\n  August 2006 was discovered.Â  When Chief Magistrate McDonald inquired how\r\n  respondent could have been conducting monthly reconciliations if the August\r\n  2006 bank statement had not been opened, respondent opined that he must have\r\n  received a copy from the bank and reiterated that he had reconciled and\r\n  initialed every bank statement through December 2006.Â  \r\nODCâ€™s investigators traveled to\r\n  respondentâ€™s office on or about February 12, 2007, and met with respondent.Â \r\n  When they arrived, respondent was attempting to reconstruct his monthly\r\n  reports.Â  He told the investigators that his secretary quit after he asked her\r\n  to provide the monthly report for January 2007.Â  Respondent insinuated that the\r\n  secretary was involved in the theft of cash from the January 2007 receipts.Â  \r\nThe investigators contacted the secretary\r\n  and she came to the office.Â  The secretary reported that respondent did not ask\r\n  her for the January 2007 monthly statement and stated she quit because\r\n  respondent criticized her for providing bond hearing procedures to Chief\r\n  Magistrate McDonald.Â  The secretary acknowledged that deposits in January had not\r\n  been made because she had not had time and said the alleged missing cash was in\r\n  the filing cabinet in respondentâ€™s office.Â  The investigators retrieved\r\n  $1,995.00 in an envelope from the filing cabinet in respondentâ€™s office which\r\n  was more than the $1,706.61 in cash that daily deposit listings showed had been\r\n  received to date in 2007.Â  In his written statement, respondent claimed he had\r\n  not put the money in the filing cabinet and did not know it was there.Â  The\r\n  secretary, who was present when the money was retrieved, stated it was not in\r\n  the same envelope she had left it in and that the cash and checks received in\r\n  January had been left in the same envelope when she resigned.Â  Respondent later\r\n  acknowledged to investigators that he had not made the required monthly\r\n  reconciliations at any time during the four years he had been a magistrate.Â  \r\nOn or about February 14, 2007, the Court\r\n  placed respondent on interim suspension.Â  In the order of suspension,\r\n  respondent was directed to deliver all books, records, funds, property, and\r\n  documents relating to his office to the Chief Magistrate for Jasper County.Â  \r\nContrary to the Courtâ€™s February 14, 2007\r\n  order, respondent removed magistrate court case files from his office.Â  On or\r\n  about February 21, 2007, Chief Magistrate McDonald required respondent return\r\n  the court files to her.Â  Respondent did not promptly return the files.Â  Soon\r\n  thereafter, Chief Magistrate McDonald went to respondentâ€™s magistrate office and\r\n  discovered that the court-issued computer was also missing.Â  Chief Magistrate\r\n  McDonald and an ODC investigator contacted respondent and requested that he\r\n  return the computer and all other court-related items to her at respondentâ€™s\r\n  office.Â  Thereafter, respondent met Chief Magistrate McDonald at the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s office and returned the computer.Â  On or about Monday, February\r\n  26, 2007, respondent returned the court files to Chief Magistrate McDonald.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he\r\n  has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501,\r\n  SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A\r\n  (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high\r\n  standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the\r\n  integrity of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid\r\n  impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with\r\n  the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence\r\n  in the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of\r\n  judicial office diligently); Canon 3(B)(2) (judge shall be faithful to the\r\n  law); Canon 3(B)(8) (judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly and\r\n  efficiently); Canon 3(C)(1) (judge shall maintain professional competence in\r\n  judicial administration and should cooperate with other judges and court\r\n  officials in the administration of court business); Canon 3(C)(2) (judge shall\r\n  require staff to observe standards of diligence that apply to the judge).Â  Further,\r\n  respondent admits that he has violated\r\n    Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code\r\n    of Judicial Conduct), Rule 7(a)(1)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for\r\n    judge to persistently fail to perform judicial duties), Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall\r\n    be ground for discipline for judge to willfully violate a valid court order\r\n    issued by a court of this state), and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for\r\n    discipline for judge to violate the Oath of Office) of the Rules for Judicial\r\n    Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall not apply for, seek, or\r\n  accept any judicial position whatsoever in this State without the prior written\r\n  authorization of this Court after due service on ODC\r\n  of any petition seeking the Courtâ€™s authorization.Â  Respondent is hereby\r\n  reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent no longer holds judicial office.Â  A

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Julie\r\n  Thames, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In\r\n  this case, the PCR court found that a supplemental jury charge on felony murder\r\n  did not violate Petitionerâ€™s due process rights, and therefore, that Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the charge.Â  This Court\r\n  granted certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s decision.Â  Because we find that\r\n  the charge unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof for malice in\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s murder conviction, we reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nA\r\n  grand jury indicted Petitioner Joseph Lowry (â€œPetitionerâ€) for murder,\r\n  possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent offense, armed\r\n  robbery, and criminal conspiracy for his role in the September 1994 robbery and\r\n  murder of a motel desk clerk in York County.Â  At trial, the court instructed\r\n  the jury on the elements of each of the charged offenses as well as the laws of\r\n  accomplice liability and criminal intent.Â  The murder charge specifically\r\n  explained the finding of malice beyond a reasonable doubt and addressed\r\n  inferences of malice which may be drawn from certain facts, such as the\r\n  performance of an unlawful act, the use of a deadly weapon, and the commission\r\n  of a felony (known as the felony murder doctrine).Â  With respect to the felony\r\n  murder doctrine, the trial court charged:\r\n\r\n\tAdditionally,\r\n  the law says if one intentionally kills another during the commission of a\r\n  felony, the inference of malice may arise.Â  If facts are proven beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt sufficient to raise an inference of malice to your\r\n  satisfaction, again I tell you this inference would be simply an evidentiary\r\n  fact to be taken into consideration by you along with the other evidence in\r\n  this case.Â  I charge you that armed robbery with[,] which [Petitioner] is also\r\n  charged[,] is under our state law a felony.\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n  the trial court directed the jury to begin deliberations, the solicitor told\r\n  the court that he had not heard the court charge the felony murder doctrine.Â \r\n  Although Petitionerâ€™s counsel and the trial court both claimed to have heard such\r\n  an instruction, the trial court ultimately agreed to bring the jurors back in\r\n  for a supplemental instruction on felony murder.Â  In order to alleviate Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  counselâ€™s concern that such a supplemental instruction would highlight the\r\n  theory of felony murder, the trial court stated that it would also incorporate\r\n  aspects of accomplice liability into the charge.  \r\nUpon\r\n  calling the jury back into the courtroom, the trial court gave the following\r\n  charge:\r\n\r\n\tLet me\r\n  follow up with a very brief instruction regarding what is sometimes referred to\r\n  as the felony murder doctrine.\r\n\tThe fact\r\n  that I brought you back in is simply because I neglected to charge this.Â  This\r\n  particular charge is not to be given any other weight or highlighted in any way\r\n  by you simply because I brought you in here and gave it to you separate from\r\n  the other. It is my mistake; I left this out, it was called to my attention, and\r\n  I must charge it to you.Â  The fact that it is isolated, you are to give it no\r\n  more consideration.Â  You are to blend it in with the charge as I have given it\r\n  to you.\r\n\t. . .\r\n  you will recall I went over and talked with you about accomplice liability, I\r\n  meant to conclude that by telling you this in regard to what is called the\r\n  felony murder doctrine.Â  That is, if a person kills another in the doing or\r\n  attempting to do an act which is considered a felony, the fact that this occurs\r\n  while one is doing or attempting to commit a felony makes the killing murder.Â \r\n  And, therefore, the killing by one of another in the commission or attempted\r\n  commission of a felony makes that killing, by virtue of it occurring in that\r\n  context[,] a murder.\r\n\r\nPetitionerâ€™s counsel did not\r\n  object to the supplemental charge.\r\nThe\r\n  jury convicted Petitioner for murder, possession of a firearm during the\r\n  commission of a violent offense, armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy.Â  The\r\n  trial court imposed a life sentence for the murder, concurrent five-year\r\n  sentences for the firearm possession and conspiracy, and a concurrent\r\n  thirty-year sentence for the armed robbery.Â  Following review pursuant to Anders\r\n    v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), this Court affirmed Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  convictions and sentences.Â  State v. Lowry, Op. No. 1998-MO-060 (S.C.\r\n  Sup. Ct. filed July 20, 1998).  \r\nFollowing\r\n  his direct appeal, Petitioner filed an application for PCR alleging, among\r\n  other things, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the\r\n  supplemental charge on felony murder.Â  Specifically, Petitioner argued that the\r\n  supplemental instruction was burden-shifting in nature and violated his due\r\n  process rights under the federal and state constitutions by presuming the\r\n  malice element of murder.[1]Â \r\n  The PCR court found that the supplemental charge, when considered in context\r\n  with the initial jury charge, was fair, and therefore, that counsel was not\r\n  ineffective in failing to object.Â  The PCR court further concluded that the\r\n  charge was not prejudicial given the â€œoverwhelming evidenceâ€ of Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  guilt produced at trial.Â  The PCR court subsequently denied Petitionerâ€™s application.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted certiorari to review Petitionerâ€™s belated appeal from the PCR\r\n  courtâ€™s decision pursuant to Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d\r\n  395 (1991) (holding that an applicant has a right to appellate counselâ€™s\r\n  assistance in seeking review of the denial of PCR), and Petitioner raises the\r\n  following issue for review:  \r\n\r\n\tWas\r\n  counsel ineffective in failing to object to the trial courtâ€™s supplemental jury\r\n  instruction on felony murder because it shifted the burden of proof for malice\r\n  from the State to the Petitioner and deprived Petitioner of due process of\r\n  law?Â Â   \r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of review\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the PCR courtâ€™s decision, an appellate court is concerned only with\r\n  whether any evidence of probative value exists to support that decision.Â  State\r\n    v. Smith, 369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006).Â  If no probative\r\n  evidence exists to support the PCR courtâ€™s findings, this Court will reverse.&nbsp; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the courtâ€™s\r\n  supplemental instruction on felony murder.Â  Specifically, Petitioner argues\r\n  that the supplemental charge created a mandatory presumption of malice that\r\n  shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defendant, thereby\r\n  depriving Petitioner of due process of law.Â  We agree.\r\nIn\r\n  order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner\r\n  must prove that (1) counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance\r\n  under prevailing professional norms, and (2) counselâ€™s deficient performance\r\n  prejudiced Petitionerâ€™s case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â \r\n  A deficient performance by counsel is prejudicial when there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, but for the counselâ€™s errors, the outcome of the trial would\r\n  have been different.Â  State v. Hill, 350 S.C. 465, 567 S.E.2d 847 (2002)\r\n  (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687).Â   \r\nPetitionerâ€™s\r\n  claim arises out of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth\r\n  Amendments, which protect an accused against conviction unless the State supplies\r\n  proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element necessary to constitute the\r\n  crime with which the accused is charged.[2]Â  In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970).Â  This principle prohibits the\r\n  use of evidentiary presumptions in a jury charge that have the effect of\r\n  relieving the State of its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to\r\n  every essential element of the crime.Â  Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979).Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  relevant inquiry for the Court in this matter is whether there is a reasonable\r\n  likelihood that the jury applied the challenged instruction in a way that\r\n  violates the Constitution.Â  Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72 (1991); Todd v. State, 355 S.C. 396, 403, 585 S.E.2d 305, 309 (2003).Â  In order\r\n  to make this determination, the challenged instruction must be examined in the\r\n  context of the trial courtâ€™s entire charge to the jury and not in isolation.Â Â  Francis\r\n    v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 315 (1985); Todd, 355 S.C. at 402,\r\n  585 S.E.2d at 308.Â  A jury instruction violates due process if it is\r\n  reasonably likely that the jury understood the charge to create a mandatory\r\n  presumption requiring it to infer an element of the offense if the State proved\r\n  certain predicate facts, thereby relieving the Stateâ€™s burden of proof on an\r\n  element of the offense.Â  Francis, 471 U.S. at 314; Sandstrom,\r\n  442 U.S. at 521.Â  The ultimate question for the Court to determine is â€œwhether\r\n  the ailing instruction . . . so infected the entire trial that the resulting\r\n  conviction violates due process.â€Â  Middleton v. McNeil, 541 U.S. 433, 437 (2004) (quoting Estelle, 502 U.S. at 72).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  find that the trial courtâ€™s supplemental instruction on felony murder\r\n  unquestionably shifted the burden of proof for the malice element of murder\r\n  from the State to Petitioner.[3]Â \r\n  Viewed in its entirety, the supplemental jury charge contained no permissive\r\n  language indicating that the jury may infer malice from Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  participation in the armed robbery.Â  Instead, the charge simply provided that if\r\n  the jury first determined that a killing occurred in the course of the armed\r\n  robbery, it must find Petitioner guilty of murder.Â  In this way, the\r\n  charge created a mandatory presumption of the malice element in the crime of\r\n  murder instead of permitting the jury to find malice upon the Stateâ€™s proof of\r\n  the element beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Both this Court and the United States\r\n  Supreme Court have consistently held that such mandatory presumptions of malice\r\n  violate a defendantâ€™s due process.Â  See Yates v. Aiken, 484 U.S. 211 (1988); Francis, 471 U.S. 307; Sandstrom, 442 U.S. 510; Arnold v.\r\n    State/Plath v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992) [hereinafter Arnold\r\n      &amp; Plath].\r\nEven\r\n  viewing the supplemental charge in conjunction with the proper instruction on\r\n  felony murder in the trial courtâ€™s initial charge does not rectify this patent\r\n  constitutional error.[4]Â \r\n  â€œLanguage that merely contradicts and does not explain a constitutionally\r\n  infirm instruction will not suffice to absolve the infirmity.â€ Francis,\r\n  471 U.S. at 322.Â  In fact, these contradictory instructions likely only\r\n  exacerbated the error by confusing the jury as to its fact-finding duties with\r\n  respect to Petitionerâ€™s murder charge.Â  See also State v. Rothell, 301\r\n  S.C. 168, 169-70, 391 S.E.2d 228, 229 (1990) (â€œIt is error to give instructions\r\n  which may confuse or mislead the jury.â€).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  fact that the burden-shifting charge occurred in a supplemental instruction is\r\n  also relevant.Â  See Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 612 (1946) (noting the prominence of presumption language when it arises in a\r\n  supplemental instruction).Â  That the trial court prefaced the supplemental\r\n  charge with the admonition that it was â€œnot to be given any other weight or\r\n  highlighted in any wayâ€ does not alter the fact that the improper charge on\r\n  felony murder was the last thing the jurors heard before beginning\r\n  deliberations and that its brevity was likely received by the jurors with\r\n  â€œheightened alertness rather than the normal attentiveness which may well flag\r\n  from time to time during the lengthy initial charge.â€Â  Arroyo v. Jones, 685 F.2d 35 (2d. Cir. 1982) (finding\r\n  constitutional error in presumption language in a supplemental charge on the\r\n  element of intent because of its special prominence and the series of questions\r\n  from the jury preceding the supplemental charge).Â   \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the\r\n  supplemental charge to create a mandatory presumption that required it to find\r\n  malice if the State proved Petitionerâ€™s involvement in the armed robbery.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that the juryâ€™s application of the instruction violated Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  due process rights and therefore, that counsel was deficient in failing to\r\n  object to the charge.\r\nThe\r\n  analysis in this case, however, does not end here.Â  Certain constitutional errors\r\n  may be harmless in terms of their effect on the fact-finding process at trial.Â  Sullivan vs. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 279 (1993) (quoting Delaware v.\r\n    Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681 (1986)).Â  For this reason, an\r\n  unconstitutional jury instruction will not require reversal of the conviction\r\n  if the Court determines â€œbeyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of\r\n  did not contribute to the verdict obtained.â€Â  Arnold &amp; Plath, 309\r\n  S.C. at 165, 420 S.E.2d at 838 (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18\r\n  (1967)).Â   \r\nHarmless\r\n  error review looks to the basis on which the jury actually rested its verdict.Â  Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 279.Â  From this perspective, in order to conclude\r\n  that the error did not contribute to the verdict, the Court must â€œfind that\r\n  error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the\r\n  issue in question, as revealed in the record.â€Â  Yates v. Evatt, 500 U.S. 391, 403 (1991).Â  With respect to an unconstitutional presumption in a jury\r\n  instruction, this means the Court must make a judgment about the significance\r\n  of the presumption to the jury, measured against the other evidence considered\r\n  by the jury independently of the presumption.Â  Id. at 403-04.Â  A\r\n  judgment in this regard entails two steps:Â  (1) the Court must ask what\r\n  evidence the jury actually considered in reaching its verdict, and (2) the\r\n  Court must weigh the probative force of the evidence as against the probative\r\n  force of the presumption standing alone. Â Id. at 404.Â   \r\nOne\r\n  of the earliest cases in which this Court applied the Yates two-step\r\n  harmless error analysis arose under circumstances similar to the present case. Arnold\r\n    &amp; Plath involved the murder of a hitchhiker by four individuals acting\r\n  in concert.Â  309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834.Â  In a joint trial, co-defendants\r\n  Arnold and Plath were each convicted of murder and sentenced to death for their\r\n  involvement in the crime.Â  The defendants filed PCR petitions challenging the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s judgment on the grounds that the charge to the jury\r\n  unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof for malice.Â  Id.Â  In a\r\n  consolidated appeal from the PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief to Arnold and Plath,\r\n  this Court found that although the trial courtâ€™s charge unconstitutionally\r\n  shifted the burden of proof for malice, the error was harmless beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.Â  In its analysis, the Court considered testimony by the\r\n  forensic pathologist describing the extent of the victimâ€™s physical injuries,\r\n  as well as credible testimony by defendant Plath and the two other accomplices\r\n  to the crime detailing the brutality of the victimâ€™s murder.Â  Id. at\r\n  167-170, 420 S.E.2d at 840-41.Â  Based on this extensive testimony, the Court\r\n  held that the probative force of the direct evidence was such that beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt, the jury could not have rested its verdict solely on the\r\n  presumption of malice.Â  Id. at 171-72, 420 S.E.2d at 841-42.Â \r\n  Accordingly, this Court affirmed the PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief.Â  See also\r\n    Yates, 500 U.S. at 406 n.10 (explaining that in some cases, the predicate\r\n  facts to be relied on under the presumption may be â€œso closely related to the\r\n  ultimate fact to be presumed that no rational jury could find those facts\r\n  without also finding the ultimate factâ€ (quoting Carella v. California,\r\n  491 U.S. 263, 271 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring))).Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  applying this two-step analysis to the instant case, we find the evidentiary\r\n  circumstances to be markedly different from those in Arnold &amp; Plath.Â \r\n  Â Viewing the primary direct evidence against Petitioner at trial and weighing\r\n  the probative force of this evidence against the probative force of the\r\n  presumption standing alone, we find that the direct evidence suggests the jury\r\n  assigned considerable significance to the unconstitutional presumption of\r\n  malice in the trial courtâ€™s supplemental instruction.Â   \r\nAt\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s trial, the Stateâ€™s primary direct evidence consisted of three\r\n  statements to police in which Petitioner gave certain information about the\r\n  crime, along with testimony by two of Petitionerâ€™s co-defendants in the\r\n  conspiracy describing Petitionerâ€™s involvement.Â  Additionally, the State\r\n  produced two friends of Petitioner (not involved in the crime) who testified as\r\n  to details allegedly corroborating Petitionerâ€™s involvement in the murder.Â \r\n  Petitioner himself did not testify at trial and did not produce any witnesses\r\n  or other evidence on his behalf.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find little direct probative evidence of malice in Petitionerâ€™s first two\r\n  statements given to police, which merely provided information about the crime\r\n  and Petitionerâ€™s acknowledgement that he was present at the crime scene.Â  Only\r\n  the final statement - which was unsigned by Petitioner and merely consisted of\r\n  notes by the SLED agent assigned to the case - explained Petitionerâ€™s role as a\r\n  lookout who was to â€œcome out shootingâ€ if police arrived on the scene while the\r\n  crime was taking place.Â  We also find that the credibility of Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  co-defendants who testified that Petitioner was instrumental in planning the\r\n  robbery and murder is questionable at best.Â  Petitioner voluntarily implicated\r\n  both co-defendants prior to Petitioner himself being investigated for the\r\n  crime, and co-defendant Melick Russell even admitted wanting retaliation for\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s turning him in to police.Â  Co-defendant Mimi Allison Hodgesâ€™s\r\n  testimony that she had received a lighter sentence for her role in the crime in\r\n  exchange for her testimony against Petitioner and the other conspirators has\r\n  similar implications on her credibility, in our view.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  probative value of Petitionerâ€™s friendsâ€™ testimony with respect to malice is\r\n  also minimal.Â  One friend testified that Petitioner bragged about a murder, but\r\n  also stated that he did not believe Petitionerâ€™s story because â€œwhere Iâ€™m from,\r\n  you kill somebody, you donâ€™t walk around and talk about it.â€Â  Another friend\r\n  who testified Petitioner sold him a gun allegedly taken from the victim during\r\n  the robbery could not produce the gun for comparison purposes.Â  Ultimately, the\r\n  only undisputed relevant facts to be gleaned from the evidence on the record\r\n  are that Petitioner was near the scene of the crime at the time it occurred,\r\n  but was neither the gunman, nor in the getaway car.Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nEven\r\n  though the State points out that the trial court thoroughly instructed the jury\r\n  on its role in evaluating the credibility of witnesses and determining the\r\n  voluntariness of Petitionerâ€™s statements, we find that the evidence considered\r\n  by the jury does not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the juryâ€™s guilty\r\n  murder verdict is not attributable to the unconstitutional presumption of\r\n  malice.Â  In our opinion, there is no overwhelming evidence tending to establish\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s guilt of murder.Â  More specifically, we find that the probative\r\n  force of the undisputed facts along with all other evidence purporting to\r\n  establish Petitionerâ€™s central role in the conspiracy do not rise to the level\r\n  of â€œmaliceâ€ such that we may conclude that the mandatory presumption did not\r\n  play a significant role in the juryâ€™s guilty verdict.Â  Therefore, we hold that\r\n  the unconstitutional presumption of malice articulated in the supplemental jury\r\n  instruction on felony murder did not constitute harmless error beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.Â   \r\nBecause\r\n  the unconstitutional jury instruction did not constitute harmless error in\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s murder conviction, we find that there is a reasonable probability\r\n  that, but for counselâ€™s failure to object to the unconstitutional jury\r\n  instruction, the outcome of the trial would have been different.Â  See Arnold\r\n    &amp; Plath, 309 S.C. at 165, 420 S.E.2d at 838 (noting that the\r\n  requirement that a constitutional error be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n  â€œembodies a standard requiring reversal â€˜if there is a reasonable possibility\r\n  that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the convictionâ€™â€ (quoting Yates, 500 U.S. at 403)).Â  Accordingly, we hold that trial counsel was\r\n  ineffective in failing to object to the supplemental charge, and therefore,\r\n  that the PCR court erred in denying Petitionerâ€™s application for relief.Â  \r\n \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision dismissing Petitionerâ€™s application and grant\r\n  relief as to Petitionerâ€™s murder conviction.\r\nMOORE, WALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Appellate counsel briefly outlined the issue in the\r\n  instant case in the Anders brief, but did not raise the issue on direct\r\n  appeal because it had not been preserved for review.Â   \r\n[2] Similar protections are provided in our state constitution.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Const. art. I, Â§ 3.Â   \r\n[3] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003) (â€œâ€˜Murderâ€™ is the killing of\r\n  any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied.â€) (italics in\r\n  original).\r\n[4] The trial courtâ€™s instruction on felony murder in its initial charge to the\r\n  jury is similar to that characterized as a â€œproper charge on implied maliceâ€ by\r\n  this Court.Â  See State v. Norris, 285 S.C. 86, 92, 328 S.E.2d 339, 343\r\n  (1985) (overruled on other grounds by State v.

Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, forÂ  Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\t\t\t\tDavid\r\n  Harold Hanna, Sr., of Spartanburg, pro se.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any\r\n  sanction in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent requests that, if the\r\n  Court imposes a period of suspension or disbarment, that the suspension or\r\n  disbarment be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension, January\r\n  18, 2007.Â  In the Matter of Hanna, 371 S.C. 510, 640 S.E.2d 871 (2007).Â \r\n  In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs incurred by ODC and the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct in investigating this matter.Â  We accept the\r\n  agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state,\r\n  retroactive to the date of his interim suspension. Â The facts, as set forth in\r\n  the agreement, are as follows.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits the material portions of the factual allegations set out in the Formal\r\n  Charges.Â  The Formal Charges charge respondent with nine instances of misconduct.\r\n \r\n\r\nMatter I\r\nComplainant\r\n  A was the heir of the late Mr. and Mrs. Doe.Â  Respondent had prepared a will\r\n  for Mr. Doe.Â  Mr. Doe passed away.Â  Respondent prepared a will for Mrs. Doe.Â \r\n  Mrs. Doe passed away shortly after Mr. Doe and before his estate was closed.Â  The\r\n  will prepared for Mrs. Doe included a devise of real property to respondent.Â \r\n \r\nPrior her\r\n  death, respondent purchased a truck from Mrs. Doe that had belonged to Mr.\r\n  Doe.Â  Respondent entered into this business transaction with his client without\r\n  complying with the consultation and consent requirements of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct.Â  Respondent did not timely respond to the initial inquiry\r\n  and several requests for additional information from ODC regarding this matter.\r\n\r\nMatter II\r\nComplainant\r\n  B paid respondent $2,500.00 to assist him in a custody dispute.Â  Respondent did\r\n  not hold the retainer in trust until it was earned.Â  There were delays and\r\n  continuances in the matter.Â  Respondent did not adequately communicate with\r\n  Complainant B regarding the scheduling of the hearing.Â  Respondent did not\r\n  respond to the initial inquiry or the Treacy[1] letter from ODC.Â   \r\n\r\nMatter III\r\nIn 1999,\r\n  certain real property was deeded to Complainants Mr. and Mrs. Jones in a\r\n  closing conducted by a contract attorney for a closing services company called\r\n  Magnolia Title.Â  In 2003, Mr. and Mrs. Jones attempted to sell the property.Â \r\n  At that time, they learned that the property description in the 1999 deed was\r\n  incorrect.Â  By that time, the grantor had died.\r\nRespondent\r\n  was a contract attorney for Magnolia Title.[2]Â \r\n  He also served as legal counsel for Magnolia Title.Â  Respondent prepared a\r\n  corrective deed and contacted the heir to the grantor.Â  The heir indicated she\r\n  was not willing to sign a corrective deed until she spoke with Mr. and Mrs.\r\n  Jones.Â  She requested respondent arrange a meeting.Â  She did not hear anything\r\n  further from respondent.Â   \r\nA\r\n  corrective deed was filed.Â  The signature of the grantorâ€™s heir was forged and\r\n  falsely witnessed and notarized.Â  Respondent recorded the deed.Â   \r\nWhen the\r\n  forgery was discovered by Mr. and Mrs. Jones, respondent sent a proposed\r\n  agreement in which they would agree to â€œuse all efforts possible to correct a\r\n  title problemâ€ for the property, that â€œthere was a clerical error in the past\r\n  deed,â€ and that they would â€œuse their best efforts in assisting Magnolia Title\r\n  Agency Incorporated in any and all methods necessary to complete this actionâ€¦includingâ€¦\r\nassisting in any court\r\n  action.â€Â  Mr. and Mrs. Jones did not sign this agreement.Â  Respondent did not\r\n  disclose the conflict of interest created by his representation of his clientsâ€™\r\n  interests and the interests of Magnolia Title either prior to or subsequent to\r\n  sending the proposed agreement.Â   \r\nMr. and\r\n  Mrs. Jones specifically instructed respondent not to sue the grantorâ€™s heir on\r\n  their behalf.Â  Respondent filed a quiet title action against the grantorâ€™s heir\r\n  naming Magnolia Title and Mr. and Mrs. Jones as plaintiffs.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  did not timely respond to ODCâ€™s written inquires in this matter.\r\n\r\nMatter IV\r\nIn July\r\n  2004, Complainant C paid respondent $1,750.00 to represent her in a custody\r\n  matter involving her grandchildren.Â  ODC investigated the allegations of\r\n  neglect, incompetence, and lack of adequate communication and concluded there\r\n  was not clear and convincing evidence to support Complainant Câ€™s allegations.Â  Respondent\r\n  failed to submit a timely response to the initial inquiry from ODC.Â   \r\n\r\nMatter V\r\nComplainant\r\n  D was represented by respondentâ€™s partner in a civil case.Â  Complainant D\r\n  obtained a favorable judgment, but the defendant was in bankruptcy.Â  Respondent\r\n  agreed to assist with collection of the judgment since he handled bankruptcy\r\n  cases for the firm.Â   \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  respondent left the partnership and took the file with him.Â  He collected a\r\n  number of payments from the bankruptcy trustee and passed them onto Complainant\r\n  D.Â  Respondent did not withhold any fees or costs from those payments.Â   \r\nIn May\r\n  2005, respondent received a check for $5,000.00 from the proceeds of the sale\r\n  of the defendantâ€™s real property.Â  Respondent placed this money in his trust\r\n  account.Â  He told Complainant D that he needed to review the bankruptcy\r\n  payments and check with his former firm about the fee arrangements and costs\r\n  incurred in the civil case.Â  By August 2005, Complainant D had not heard\r\n  anything from respondent so she contacted his former firm.Â   \r\nAfter\r\n  receiving notice of this grievance, respondent contacted his former firm to\r\n  attempt to get the matter resolved.Â  When their communications broke down,\r\n  respondentâ€™s attorney advised him to hold the funds in his trust account.Â  On\r\n  August 27, 2006, respondent sent Complainant D a trust account check for the\r\n  full $5,000.00.  \r\nODC\r\n  requested copies of respondentâ€™s bank statements to verify that the funds had\r\n  remained in trust until disbursed.Â  Respondent did not comply with this\r\n  request.Â Â Â Â   \r\n\r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent\r\n  established a business relationship with Magnolia Title, a closing services\r\n  company owned by a non-lawyer.Â  The relationship included respondentâ€™s\r\n  representation of Magnolia Titleâ€™s clients in real estate closings and the\r\n  representation of Magnolia Title in claims and litigation arising from\r\n  closings.Â  Respondent was one of the several contract attorneys who conducted\r\n  closings for Magnolia Title.\r\nThe\r\n  common practice for non-lawyer staff of Magnolia Title included the preparation\r\n  of title abstracts and closing documents for respondentâ€™s review.Â  The closing\r\n  attorney (respondent or another lawyer) would then conduct the closing and\r\n  return the documents and money to Magnolia Title.Â  Disbursements of settlement\r\n  proceeds were made at the closings prior to the deposit of funds.Â  The\r\n  non-lawyer staff would then conduct post-closing activities such as recording\r\n  the documents and obtaining title insurance.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  allowed Magnolia Title to open an IOLTA account on which he shared signatory\r\n  authority with a non-lawyer paralegal employed by Magnolia Title.Â  Magnolia\r\n  Title used that trust account for all of its closings, regardless of whether\r\n  respondent handled the closing.Â  Respondent ultimately severed his ties with\r\n  Magnolia Title, but he did not close the trust account.\r\nMagnolia\r\n  Title used an out-of-state bookkeeping service for reconciliation and\r\n  management of the trust account.Â  Respondent did not have access to the\r\n  Magnolia Title trust account records when ODC requested them.Â  Respondent did\r\n  not instruct the non-lawyer staff of Magnolia Title or the out-of-state\r\n  bookkeeping company regarding the requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.Â   \r\nComplainant\r\n  E rented real property to Mr. Smith.Â  Mr. Smith wanted to purchase the\r\n  property.Â  Complainant E agreed to finance the purchase with a $3,000.00 down\r\n  payment.Â  Complainant E asked respondent to handle the closing for Mr. Smith.Â \r\n  Mr. Smith gave Complainant E a personal check for the down payment plus closing\r\n  costs. Â Complainant E negotiated the personal check for a cashierâ€™s check,\r\n  delivered it to Magnolia Title, and scheduled the closing.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  conducted the closing and delivered the documents to Magnolia Title to record.Â \r\n  The deed and mortgage were not recorded.Â  When Complainant E contacted\r\n  respondent after the closing, respondent assured him that the documents had\r\n  been recorded.Â   \r\nComplainant\r\n  E discovered that the deed and mortgage had not been recorded when he received\r\n  a tax notice on the property six months later.Â  By that time, Mr. Smith had\r\n  defaulted on some of his mortgage payments.Â  Respondent advised Complainant E\r\n  not to file the deed and mortgage at that time in order to avoid a foreclosure.Â \r\n \r\nODC made\r\n  repeated inquiries to respondent regarding an accounting of funds paid from Mr.\r\n  Smithâ€™s check to Magnolia Title for recording fees, deed stamps, title\r\n  insurance premiums, etc., that should have been refunded.Â  Respondent did not\r\n  respond.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\nMatter VII\r\nComplainant\r\n  F retained respondent to represent her in connection with injuries sustained in\r\n  an automobile accident on March 2, 2001.Â  When respondent left his law firm to\r\n  start a solo practice, he took Complainant Fâ€™s file with him.  \r\nComplainant\r\n  F incurred $55,000.00 in medical bills.Â  Respondent submitted a demand in\r\n  January 2004.Â  The claim was not settled.Â   \r\nOn March\r\n  3, 2004, the day after the statute of limitations expired, respondent filed\r\n  suit.Â  The pleadings had been back-dated to March 1, 2004.Â  Respondent was\r\n  unable to locate the defendant for service. He did not attempt service by\r\n  publication.Â  The lawsuit was dismissed.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  did not have malpractice insurance.Â  He attempted to settle with Complainant F\r\n  for $8,000.00.Â  In his communications with Complainant F regarding this\r\n  proposal, respondent did not comply with the disclosure and consultation\r\n  requirements of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â Â Â   \r\n\r\nMatter VIII\r\nComplainant\r\n  G hired respondent for three legal matters.Â  Respondent failed to adequately\r\n  communicate with Complainant G regarding those matters.  \r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to timely respond to the Notice of Full Investigation in this matter.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to respond to ODCâ€™s request for additional information.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter IX\r\nComplainant\r\n  H hired respondent to represent him in a bankruptcy matter.Â  A creditorsâ€™\r\n  meeting was held on May 30, 2006.Â  At that meeting, the trustee raised concerns\r\n  about Complainant Hâ€™s transfer of real estate to his daughter prior to filing\r\n  bankruptcy.  \r\nRespondent\r\n  asked Complainant H to gather documents related to the conveyance.Â  Complainant\r\n  H complied with this request and met with respondentâ€™s assistant in his absence\r\n  on June 9, 2006.Â  The assistant drafted a letter of explanation to the trustee\r\n  and enclosed the documents.Â  She left the draft and documents for respondentâ€™s\r\n  review.Â   \r\nComplainant\r\n  H tried repeatedly to contact respondent, but he did not respond.Â  As of July\r\n  21, 2006, the date Complainant H submitted his grievance, he had not heard from\r\n  respondent.\r\nIn his\r\n  response to ODC, respondent stated he did review the draft letter prepared by\r\n  his assistant but did not send it because he wanted to include a copy of the\r\n  appraisal which he claimed Complainant H had not yet provided.Â  Respondent\r\n  submitted copies of a number of letters that he claimed he sent to Complainant\r\n  H asking for a copy of the appraisal.Â  Complainant H never received these\r\n  letters.Â   \r\nUltimately,\r\n  respondent submitted the letter to the trustee on August 21, 2006, after\r\n  receiving notice of the grievance.Â  The only change respondent made to the\r\n  draft initially prepared by his assistant was to add a paragraph that said the\r\n  delay was due to Complainant Hâ€™s failure to provide documentation to respondent\r\n  and that Complainant H had become forgetful.Â   \r\nWhile\r\n  Complaint Hâ€™s matter was pending before the bankruptcy court, the Honorable\r\n  John E. Waites, United States Bankruptcy Judge, submitted a copy of the order\r\n  of the bankruptcy court in In the Matter of Farnsworth indefinitely\r\n  suspending respondent from practicing before the bankruptcy court in this state\r\n  to ODC.Â  This indefinite suspension followed various sanctions against\r\n  respondent in fourteen prior matters from 2003 to 2006.Â  These prior sanctions\r\n  were imposed for a variety of problems, including failing to obtain debtorsâ€™\r\n  signatures on schedules and amended plans, failing to disclose previous\r\n  filings, deficient representation, violating local rules, filing improper\r\n  motions, and failing to timely remit filing fees.  \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his\r\n  misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to client); Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall abide by clientâ€™s\r\n  decisions concerning objectives of representations); Rule 1.3 (lawyer \r\nshall act with reasonable diligence and promptness\r\n    in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about\r\n      the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for\r\n      information); Rule 1.7(a) (lawyer shall not represent client if\r\n  representation will be directly adverse to another client unless lawyer\r\n  reasonably believes representation will not adversely affect relationship with\r\n  the other client and each client consents after consultation); Rule 1.7(b) (lawyer\r\n  shall not represent client if the representation of that client may be\r\n  materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to a third person unless lawyer\r\n  reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the\r\n  client consents after consultation); Rule 1.8(a) (lawyer shall not enter\r\n  into business transaction with a client unless terms are fair and client\r\n  consents in writing); Rule 1.8(c) (lawyer shall not prepare an instrument\r\n  giving lawyer substantial gift from a client); Rule 1.8(h) (lawyer shall not\r\n  settle a claim for liability with unrepresented client or former client unless\r\n  that person is advised in writing of desirability of seeking and reasonable\r\n  opportunity to seek independent legal counsel); Rule 1.9 (lawyer who has formerly\r\n  represented client in matter shall not thereafter represent another person in\r\n  same or substantially related matter in which that personâ€™s interests are\r\n  materially adverse to the interest of the former client unless the former\r\n  client gives informed consent in writing); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly\r\n  deliver funds to which client is entitled; lawyer shall deposit unearned legal\r\n  fees into trust account and withdraw funds only when earned); Rule 3.3 (lawyer\r\n  shall not knowingly make false statement of fact to tribunal); Rule 5.3 (lawyer\r\n  having direct supervisory authority over non-lawyer shall make reasonable\r\n  efforts to ensure that personâ€™s conduct is compatible with professional\r\n  obligations of lawyer and shall be responsible for non-lawyerâ€™s conduct if\r\n  conduct would be a violation of Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by\r\n  lawyer); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand\r\n  for information from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d)\r\n  (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving\r\n  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial\r\n  to the administration of justice).[3]Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent further admits his\r\n  misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(2) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct violating applicable rules of professional\r\n  conduct in another jurisdiction), Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for lawyer to knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from\r\n  disciplinary authority), Rule 7(a)(5) ( it shall be ground for discipline for\r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute administration of justice, bring\r\n  courts or legal profession into disrepute, or conduct demonstrating an\r\n  unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be ground for discipline\r\n  for lawyer to willfully violate a court order). Â In addition, respondent admits\r\n  his misconduct violated Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\n   \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  The disbarment shall be retroactive to the\r\n  date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date\r\n  of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC and the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct in the investigation of these matters.Â  Within\r\n  fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of\r\n  Law to the Clerk of Court.Â   \r\nIn addition, should it be determined\r\n  that any restitution remains outstanding, ODC and respondent shall file a\r\n  restitution plan with the Court within thirty (30) days of the date of this\r\n  opinion.Â  In the plan, respondent shall agree to pay restitution to all\r\n  clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a\r\n  result of his misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Moreover, in the\r\n  restitution plan, respondent shall agree to reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for\r\n  Client Protection for any claims paid as a result of his misconduct in\r\n  connection with this matter.Â   \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).Â  \r\n \r\n[2] Respondent was not the contract attorney who\r\n  conducted the 1999 closing for Mr. and Mrs. Jones.Â   \r\n[3] The Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at\r\n  the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26438","title":"Lorenzen v.

Â A\r\n  few weeks after the sexual intercourse incident, the victim told her mother, a school\r\n  teacher, and the school psychologist about the abuse.Â   \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  school officials reported the victimâ€™s allegations of sexual abuse to the Aiken\r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  After the initial interview, the victim was\r\n  immediately examined by an emergency room doctor.Â  Two weeks later, a physician\r\n  with the Lexington County Childrenâ€™s Center examined the victim to determine\r\n  whether she had been subjected to chronic sexual abuse.Â  Neither examination\r\n  revealed physical evidence of sexual assault.Â  However, both physicians\r\n  testified that the absence of such evidence did not necessarily negate the\r\n  victimâ€™s allegations of sexual abuse.  \r\nAfter\r\n  the abuse had been revealed, the victim was involved in several violent\r\n  incidents with family members and others which resulted in her being committed\r\n  to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ).\r\nDr.\r\n  Kay Jordan, a counselor specializing in child sexual abuse, was qualified as an\r\n  expert witness for the State.Â  Dr. Jordan testified that she had eighteen\r\n  counseling sessions with the victim between July 2000 and December 2000.Â  According\r\n  to Dr. Jordan, the victim exhibited symptoms of sexual abuse in that she had nightmares,\r\n  flashbacks, and became violent.Â  Based on her sessions, Dr. Jordan diagnosed the victim with post-traumatic stress disorder.Â  Dr. Jordan explained that her diagnosis was also based on the victimâ€™s history of psychiatric\r\n  treatment for these symptoms which began when the victim was nine or ten years\r\n  old.  \r\nLorenzen\r\n  declined to testify in his defense and did not offer any witnesses.Â  The jury\r\n  convicted Lorenzen of first-degree CSC with a minor, second-degree CSC with a\r\n  minor, and lewd act upon a child.Â  The trial judge, however, granted defense\r\n  counselâ€™s motion for a new trial on the lewd act upon a child charge because\r\n  the State failed to offer evidence that Lorenzen was over the age of fourteen\r\n  years when the act occurred.Â  On the two remaining charges, the judge sentenced\r\n  Lorenzen to life in prison without the possibility of parole pursuant to\r\n  section 17-25-45 of the South Carolina Code.[1]\r\nAfter\r\n  the Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions and sentence, Lorenzen filed an\r\n  application for post-conviction relief. Â State v. Larry Lorenzen, Op.\r\n  No. 2003-UP-436 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 25, 2003). Â \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Lorenzen testified that he believed his trial counsel should\r\n  have retained an expert witness to:Â  (1) examine him in order to prove that he\r\n  was not a pedophile; (2) discuss the lack of physical evidence of sexual abuse;\r\n  (3) delve into the psychological issues of the victim; and (4) challenge Dr. Jordanâ€™s testimony.Â  Lorenzen also stated that it would have been helpful for the jury to\r\n  have heard that the victimâ€™s father was on the sexual offender registry.Â \r\n  Lorenzen further asserted that it might have made a difference if he had\r\n  testified at trial.Â  However, he admitted the â€œcase was stacked againstâ€ him at\r\n  the point he would have testified.Â  He ultimately asserted that counselâ€™s\r\n  â€œperformance prejudiced [him] such that it rendered the proceeding\r\n  fundamentally unfair.â€  \r\nDuring\r\n  her testimony, trial counsel admitted that Lorenzenâ€™s case was only her third\r\n  jury trial and her first trial involving a sex crime.Â  She testified she had\r\n  become more experienced with this type of case since Lorenzenâ€™s trial.Â \r\n  Specifically, she had learned that it is helpful to have the defendant examined\r\n  by a forensic psychologist in order to assess the personâ€™s propensity for\r\n  engaging in the alleged sexually-deviant behavior.Â  Additionally, she believed\r\n  it would have been beneficial for an independent doctor to review the victimâ€™s medical\r\n  records.Â  In terms of the victimâ€™s records, counsel stated she had the records\r\n  from the victimâ€™s sessions with the sexual abuse counselor as well as the records\r\n  from the psychological facilities that treated the victim.Â  Counsel, however,\r\n  stated the victimâ€™s police interview was not videotaped, which she now knew was\r\n  part of the suggested protocol in child victim cases. Â She also acknowledged\r\n  that expert witnesses could have been called to counter Dr. Jordanâ€™s testimony.Â  Counsel further testified she was not aware at the time of trial that\r\n  the victimâ€™s father was on the sexual offender registry.Â  Had she known this\r\n  fact, counsel stated she would have cross-examined the Stateâ€™s expert witness\r\n  regarding the possibility that the victim was abused by her father. Â Finally,\r\n  counsel informed the court that the public defenderâ€™s office was short staffed\r\n  at the time of trial.Â  As a result, she did not have a more experienced public\r\n  defender assisting her during the trial.  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge granted Lorenzenâ€™s application for relief.Â  The judge found that\r\n  â€œtrial counsel did not adequately prepare for the trial and the defense of\r\n  [the] charges.â€Â  In reaching this decision, the judge noted that counsel was\r\n  not only â€œlacking in experience,â€ but â€œshe was also lacking in assistance at\r\n  the office.â€Â  In terms of the specifics of trial counselâ€™s performance, the\r\n  judge addressed several areas where he felt counsel was deficient.Â   \r\nSpecifically,\r\n  the judge found counsel failed to:Â  (1) retain or even consult with an expert witness;\r\n  (2) conduct an investigation to determine whether another individual,\r\n  particularly the victimâ€™s father who was listed on the sexual offender\r\n  registry, could have been responsible for sexually abusing the victim; (3) have\r\n  Lorenzen submit to a polygraph examination in order to assist in the defense;\r\n  (4) obtain the minor victimâ€™s records from the sexual abuse counselor, the\r\n  Department of Juvenile Justice, and the Department of Social Services; and (5) meet\r\n  with the minor child prior to trial.Â   \r\nUltimately,\r\n  the judge concluded that â€œ[a]ll of these shortcomings are problematic.Â  While\r\n  no individual failure alone would be a ground for granting this PCR, the\r\n  cumulative neglect is severe.â€ Â In reaching his decision to grant Lorenzenâ€™s\r\n  petition for relief, the judge relied on this Courtâ€™s opinion in Nance v.\r\n    Frederick, 358 S.C. 480, 596 S.E.2d 62 (2004).[2] Â The judge recognized that Lorenzenâ€™s counsel was not as deficient as counsel\r\n  in Nance.Â  However, he found Lorenzenâ€™s counselâ€™s â€œfailure to properly\r\n  and adequately prepare for the trial and prepare [Lorenzenâ€™s] defense in\r\n  general amounted to a complete denial of counsel and failed to subject the\r\n  prosecutionâ€™s case to a meaningful adversarial testing.â€Â  Based on this\r\n  assessment, the judge granted Lorenzenâ€™s application â€œbecause, essentially,\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective for failing to prepare and present [Lorenzenâ€™s]\r\n  case as required under the Sixth Amendment.â€Â   \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  United States v. Cronic,\r\n  466 U.S. 648 (1984); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance\r\n  and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant\r\n  decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  590, 596 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).\r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  â€œ[P]etitioner must meet the standard established in Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).â€Â  Edmond v. State, 341\r\n  S.C. 340, 346, 534 S.E.2d 682, 685 (2000).Â  In order to establish a claim of\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel, the PCR applicant must show that: Â (1)\r\n  counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2) there is a reasonable probability\r\n  that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have been\r\n  different.Â  Caprood, 338 S.C. at 109, 525 S.E.2d at 517 (citing Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a\r\n  probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.â€Â  Ard,\r\n  372 S.C. at 331, 642 S.E.2d at 596. Â â€œFurthermore, when a defendantâ€™s\r\n  conviction is challenged, â€˜the question is whether there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, absent the errors, the fact finder would have had a reasonable\r\n  doubt respecting guilt.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Strickland v. Washington,\r\n  466 U.S. 668, 695 (1984)).Â   \r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n  365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  A PCR courtâ€™s findings will be upheld on\r\n  appeal if there is â€œany evidence of probative value sufficient to support\r\n  them.â€Â  Id.Â  This Court will reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision when it is\r\n  controlled by an error\r\n  of law.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 651, 594 S.E.2d 462, 465\r\n  (2004).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Generally, an\r\n  applicant must show actual prejudice under Strickland.Â  The United\r\n  States Supreme Court and this Court have recognized that in certain limited\r\n  circumstances â€œâ€˜prejudice is presumedâ€™ because prejudice â€˜is so likely that\r\n  case-by-case inquiry . . . is not worth the cost.â€™â€Â  Nance, 367 S.C. at\r\n  551, 626 S.E.2d at 880 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692)); Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658. Â In analyzing these narrow circumstances, this Court\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tIn Cronic,\r\n  the Court identified three distinct situations in which a presumption of\r\n  prejudice is appropriate. First, prejudice is presumed when the defendant is\r\n  completely denied counsel â€œat a critical stage of his trial.â€Â  Cronic,\r\n  466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039.Â  Second, per-se prejudice occurs if there has\r\n  been a constructive denial of counsel. This happens when a lawyer â€œentirely\r\n  fails to subject the prosecutionâ€™s case to meaningful adversarial testing,â€\r\n  thus making â€œthe adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.â€ Id.Â  Third, the Court identified certain instances â€œwhen although counsel is\r\n  available to assist the accused during trial, the likelihood that any lawyer,\r\n  even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that\r\n  a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual\r\n  conduct of the trial.â€ Id. (citing Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932)). Â A finding of per-se prejudice under any of\r\n  these three prongs is â€œan extremely high showing for a criminal defendant to\r\n  make.â€ Brown v. French, 147 F.3d 307, 313 (4th Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\nNance, 367 S.C. at 552, 626 S.E.2d at 880.Â \r\n  Although an applicant â€œmust ordinarily show actual prejudice, he may be\r\n  relieved of that burden if counselâ€™s ineffectiveness is so pervasive as to\r\n  render a particularized prejudice inquiry unnecessary.â€Â  Green v. State,\r\n  351 S.C. 184, 196, 569 S.E.2d 318, 324 (2002).Â   \r\nI.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the PCR judge erred in finding that trial counsel was ineffective\r\n  for failing to call expert witnesses during Lorenzenâ€™s trial.Â  For several\r\n  reasons, we agree with the Stateâ€™s assertion.Â   \r\nFirst,\r\n  Lorenzen failed to present evidence that would show a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s failure to call\r\n  expert witnesses, the result of his trial would have been different.Â  Aside\r\n  from his testimony and his trial counselâ€™s testimony, Lorenzen did not offer\r\n  any other witnesses to testify on his behalf at the PCR hearing.Â  Therefore, it\r\n  is merely speculative that these allegedly favorable expert witnesses would\r\n  have aided in his defense.Â  See Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 369,\r\n  610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005) (â€œA PCR applicant cannot show that he was prejudiced\r\n  by counselâ€™s failure to call a favorable witness to testify at trial if that\r\n  witness does not later testify at the PCR hearing or otherwise offer testimony\r\n  within the rules of evidence.â€); see also Porter v. State, 368\r\n  S.C. 378, 386, 629 S.E.2d 353, 358 (2006) (â€œMere speculation of what a witnessâ€™\r\n  testimony may be is insufficient to satisfy the burden of showing prejudice in\r\n  a petition for PCR.â€).  \r\nSecondly,\r\n  counselâ€™s failure to procure expert witnesses did not render her representation\r\n  deficient given she vigorously cross-examined the Stateâ€™s witnesses and\r\n  attacked the accuracy of the evidence.Â  See Frasier v. State, 306\r\n  S.C. 158, 160-61, 410 S.E.2d 572, 573 (1991) (finding trial counsel was not\r\n  deficient in failing to procure an expert witness to challenge DNA evidence\r\n  presented at trial where the record established that counsel vigorously\r\n  cross-examined the Stateâ€™s DNA experts and attacked the accuracy of the\r\n  evidence).Â  At trial, Lorenzenâ€™s counsel attacked the Stateâ€™s evidence through\r\n  cross-examination as well as by positing objections when appropriate.Â Â Â \r\n  Counsel also vigorously cross-examined Dr. Jordan, the Stateâ€™s expert witness. Significantly,\r\n  Lorenzen admitted at the PCR hearing that counsel had brought out â€œsome good\r\n  pointsâ€ during her cross-examination.Â  Finally, it is noteworthy that counsel\r\n  in preparing her case had the assistance of two public defenders.Â  Neither\r\n  public defender recommended or suggested that counsel retain expert witnesses\r\n  for Lorenzenâ€™s defense.  \r\nBecause Lorenzen\r\n  failed to meet his burden that trial counsel was deficient and that the result\r\n  of his trial would have been different but for this alleged deficiency, we hold\r\n  the PCR judge erred in finding Lorenzenâ€™s counselâ€™s failure to call expert\r\n  witnesses was a critical error in the alleged cumulative errors that\r\n  constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  State contends the PCR judge erred in finding Lorenzenâ€™s trial counsel was\r\n  ineffective for failing to raise the fact that the victimâ€™s father was on the\r\n  sexual offender registry. Â We agree with the Stateâ€™s contention.Â   \r\nBecause the PCR\r\n  judge admitted the registry without explanation over the Stateâ€™s objection, it\r\n  is difficult to discern the basis for its admission.Â  In any event, we conclude\r\n  the sexual offender registry would not have been admissible at trial.Â   \r\nâ€œOur Supreme Court has imposed strict limitations on the\r\n  admissibility of third-party\r\n  guilt.â€ State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 81, 538 S.E.2d 257, 265 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000).Â  â€œEvidence offered by a defendant as to the commission of the crime\r\n  by another person is limited to facts which are inconsistent with the defendantâ€™s\r\n  guilt.â€ Id. Â Recently, after\r\n  Lorenzenâ€™s trial and PCR hearing, our United States Supreme Court clarified the\r\n  above-outlined rule regarding the admission of third-party guilt in Holmes\r\n    v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319 (2006).Â  In Holmes, the Supreme\r\n  Court considered the question of â€œwhether a criminal defendantâ€™s federal\r\n  constitutional rights are violated by [a South Carolina] evidence rule under\r\n  which the defendant may not introduce proof of third-party guilt if the\r\n  prosecution has introduced forensic evidence that, if believed, strongly\r\n  supports a guilty verdict.â€Â  Id. at 321.Â  The Supreme Court answered this\r\n  question in the affirmative.Â  The Courtâ€™s holding essentially permits a\r\n  defendant to introduce evidence of third-party guilt regardless of the strength\r\n  of the Stateâ€™s case if the evidence meets the following criteria:\r\n\r\n\t[E]vidence offered by accused as to the\r\n  commission of the crime by another person must be limited to such facts as are\r\n  inconsistent with his own guilt, and to such facts as raise a reasonable\r\n  inference or presumption as to his own innocence; evidence which can have (no)\r\n  other effect than to cast a bare suspicion upon another, or to raise a\r\n  conjectural inference as to the commission of the crime by another, is not\r\n  admissible . . . . [B]efore such testimony can be received, there must be such\r\n  proof of connection with it, such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends\r\n  clearly to point out such other person as the guilty party. 198 S.C., at 104-105,\r\n  16 S.E.2d, at 534-535 (quoting 16 C.J., Criminal Law Â§ 1085, p. 560 (1918) and\r\n  20 Am.Jur., Evidence Â§ 20 265, p. 254 (1939); footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\nHolmes, 547 U.S. at 328 (quoting State v.\r\n  Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941)).\r\nApplying\r\n  the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we find the sexual offender\r\n  registry listing the victimâ€™s fatherâ€™s name would not have been admissible\r\n  under either a pre- or post-Holmes third-party guilt standard.Â  Significantly,\r\n  the victimâ€™s father was listed on the registry for committing the crime of\r\n  assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the first degree which\r\n  would have involved an adult victim whereas Lorenzen was charged with criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Lorenzenâ€™s counsel at the PCR hearing\r\n  acknowledged there was nothing on the registry to indicate the victimâ€™s father\r\n  committed a crime against a child.Â  Furthermore, Lorenzenâ€™s allegation that the\r\n  victimâ€™s father may have been the perpetrator was so nebulous that it would\r\n  have had no other effect than to â€œcast a bare suspicion.â€Â  Therefore, we do not\r\n  believe these facts would be inconsistent with Lorenzenâ€™s guilt or raise a\r\n  reasonable inference of his innocence.Â  Accordingly, we find the PCR judge\r\n  erred in using this alleged error as a ground for finding Lorenzenâ€™s counsel\r\n  ineffective.\r\nIII.\r\nThe\r\n  State avers the PCR judge erred in finding that Lorenzenâ€™s counsel was\r\n  ineffective for failing to have Lorenzen submit to a polygraph examination. Â We\r\n  agree with the State.  \r\nâ€œThis Court has\r\n  consistently held the results of polygraph examinations are generally not\r\n  admissible because the reliability of the tests is questionable.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Council, 335 S.C. 1, 23, 515 S.E.2d 508, 519 (1999), cert. denied,\r\n  528 U.S. 1050 (1999).Â  Although this Court in Council declined to\r\n  recognize a per se rule against the admission of polygraph\r\n  evidence, it indicated that the â€œadmissibility of this type of scientific\r\n  evidence should be analyzed under Rules 702 and 403, SCRE and the Jones factors.â€Â  Id. at 24, 515 S.E.2d at 520.\r\nInitially, we note\r\n  the polygraph issue was not presented to the judge by either Lorenzen or his\r\n  counsel.Â  Instead, the judge essentially sua sponte raised the issue.Â  Given\r\n  this procedural posture, it was mere speculation on the part of the PCR judge\r\n  to find the admission of a favorable polygraph examination would have aided in\r\n  Lorenzenâ€™s defense.Â  Significantly, the PCR judge conceded that â€œ[w]hile the\r\n  result of any polygraph examination would obviously only be speculative, the\r\n  fact that one was not performed is problematic.â€Â  Without the results of a\r\n  polygraph examination or any other evidence concerning its admission, it is\r\n  difficult to definitively assess whether it would have been admissible at\r\n  trial.Â  Because this type of evidence is rarely admitted, we do not believe the\r\n  facts would support its admission.Â  Therefore, we find Lorenzen did not meet\r\n  his burden to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on\r\n  this ground.\r\nIV.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the PCR judge erred in finding Lorenzenâ€™s counsel was ineffective\r\n  for failing to obtain the victimâ€™s records from Dr. Jordan, the Department of\r\n  Juvenile Justice, and the Department of Social Services. Â We agree with the\r\n  State.\r\nAt the PCR hearing,\r\n  Lorenzenâ€™s trial counsel specifically testified:\r\n\r\n\tI had\r\n  extensive records in this case provided to me by the State, not only from [Dr.]\r\n  Jordanâ€™s visit with [the victim] but also from priorâ€”I had the records of all\r\n  of the physical exams that had been done as well as extensive records from [the\r\n  victimâ€™s] prior commitments to certain psychological facilities and I believe\r\n  that I had her D.J.J. records as well.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, counsel\r\n  informed the PCR judge that she had the assistance of two other public\r\n  defenders helping her prepare the case by extensively reviewing all of these\r\n  records.Â  Because there is no evidence in the record to support this finding, we\r\n  hold the PCR judge clearly erred in relying in part on this ground to grant\r\n  Lorenzenâ€™s application for relief. Â Â See Scott v. State, 334 S.C.\r\n  248, 252, 513 S.E.2d 100, 102 (1999) (stating â€œan appellate court will not affirm the decision when it is\r\n  not supported by any probative evidenceâ€); see also Dempsey v. State,\r\n  363 S.C. 365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005) (A PCR courtâ€™s findings will be\r\n  upheld on appeal if there is â€œany evidence of probative value sufficient to\r\n  support them.â€).Â  Furthermore, Lorenzen failed to show that counselâ€™s review of\r\n  additional records would have been beneficial to his defense.Â  Lorenzenâ€™s claim\r\n  that the records would have changed the result of his trial was speculative at\r\n  best given he did not present evidence that other records existed or that the\r\n  records reviewed by counsel included exculpatory evidence.\r\nV.\r\nThe\r\n  State asserts the PCR judge erred in finding Lorenzenâ€™s counsel was ineffective\r\n  for failing to interview the victim prior to trial.Â  We agree with the Stateâ€™s\r\n  assertion.\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note that Lorenzen failed to specifically raise this issue or present any\r\n  evidence at the hearing that interviewing the victim would have led to a\r\n  different result at trial.Â  Thus, we believe that Lorenzenâ€™s mere speculation\r\n  was insufficient to meet his burden to establish that counsel was ineffective.Â  See Moorehead v. State, 329 S.C. 329, 334, 496 S.E.2d 415, 417 (1998)\r\n  (â€œFailure to conduct an independent investigation does not constitute\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel when the allegation is supported only by mere\r\n  speculation as to the result.â€).Â  Finally, we note that counsel cross-examined\r\n  the victim regarding her allegations.Â  Counsel also thoroughly cross-examined\r\n  Dr. Jordan concerning her counseling sessions with the victim and her ultimate\r\n  diagnosis.Â  Moreover, the victimâ€™s disclosure of the sexual abuse was\r\n  corroborated by several other witnesses.Â  Therefore, we conclude the PCR judge\r\n  erred in finding that counselâ€™s failure to interview the victim prior to trial\r\n  constituted a basis for his decision that counsel was ineffective.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we conclude the PCR judge erred in granting Lorenzenâ€™s application\r\n  for post-conviction relief.Â  Because none of the alleged errors are meritorious,\r\n  we hold the PCR judge incorrectly relied on Nance in finding that the\r\n  cumulative effect of these alleged errors established a claim of ineffective assistance\r\n  of counsel.[3]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the order of the PCR judge.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  The solicitor sought a sentence of life in prison\r\n  without the possibility of parole pursuant to section 17-25-25 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code based on Lorenzenâ€™s prior conviction for armed robbery.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A)(1), (C)(1) (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007) (statute\r\n  permitting the State to seek a sentence of life without the possibility of\r\n  parole if the person has one or more prior convictions for a â€œmost serious\r\n  offense,â€ which includes the offense of armed robbery).\r\n[2]Â Â  In Nance, the defendant was convicted and\r\n  received a sentence of death for murder, first-degree CSC, assault and battery\r\n  with intent to kill, first-degree burglary, and armed robbery.Â  After the\r\n  circuit court denied Nanceâ€™s application for post-conviction relief, he\r\n  petitioned for certiorari.Â  This Court granted certiorari and reversed the PCR\r\n  judgeâ€™s order on the ground Nanceâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in that he\r\n  failed to challenge the prosecutionâ€™s case against Nance.Â  The United States\r\n  Supreme Court vacated this Courtâ€™s opinion and remanded the case for\r\n  consideration in light of Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175 (2004).Â  Ozmint v. Nance, 543 U.S. 1043 (2005).\r\nPursuant\r\n  to the Supreme Courtâ€™s mandate, this Court found the case represented â€œone of\r\n  the rare cases where counsel â€˜entirely fails to subject the prosecutionâ€™s case\r\n  to meaningful adversarial testing.â€™Â  Moreover, counsel did not act as an\r\n  adversary to the prosecutionâ€™s case, but instead helped to bolster the case against his client.â€Â  Nance v. Frederick, 367 S.C. 547, 553, 626 S.E.2d 878, 881\r\n  (2006), cert. denied, 127 S.Ct. 131 (2006).Â  Specifically, this Court\r\n  found Nanceâ€™s trial counsel was deficient in the following respects:Â  (1)\r\n  counsel was taking several prescription medications during the trial which\r\n  resulted in impaired memory, lack of sleep, and sedation; (2) counsel provided\r\n  Nanceâ€™s expert witness with Nanceâ€™s medical records just a few hours before the\r\n  trial; (3) during his opening statement counsel informed the jury that he was\r\n  appointed as a public defender and did not ask for the case; (4) counsel called\r\n  a correctional officer as a witness who testified regarding Nanceâ€™s only\r\n  incident of misbehavior in jail; (5) counsel called Nanceâ€™s sister to testify\r\n  without preparing her to testify and eliciting testimony that Nance was an\r\n  abnormal child who, among other things, killed the familyâ€™s pets; and (6)\r\n  counsel referred to Nance during closing arguments as a â€œsickâ€ man who did\r\n  â€œsick things.â€Â Â  Based on the these deficiencies, this Court granted Nance a\r\n  new trial.Â  The Court found â€œthere was a total breakdown in the adversarial\r\n  processâ€ and, thus, presumed that Nance was prejudiced.Â  Id. at 555, 626\r\n  S.E.2d at 882.\r\n[3]Â Â  Although we recognize that whether the cumulation of several\r\n  errors, â€œwhich by themselves are not prejudicial, would warrant relief is an\r\n  unsettled question in South Carolinaâ€ we do not believe the facts of this case\r\n  present an opportunity to definitively decide this question. See Green\r\n    v. State, 351 S.C. 184, 197, 569 S.E.2d 318, 325 (2002); Simpson v.\r\n      Moore, 367 S.C. 587, 604, 627 S.E.2d 701, 710 (2006) (citing Green and stating â€œ[w]hether several errors, which are independently found not be\r\n  prejudicial, may cumulatively warrant relief is an unsettled question in South Carolinaâ€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Alexander v.

\r\nCanon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the\r\n    appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 4(A)(2) (judge shall conduct\r\n    all extra-judicial activities so they do not demean the judicial office); and\r\n    Canon 4(D)(1) (judge shall not engage in financial dealings that may be\r\n    reasonably perceived to exploit judgeâ€™s judicial position).Â  Respondent admits\r\n    his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the following\r\n    provisions of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502,\r\n    SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1)(it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the\r\n    Code of Judicial Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for\r\n    judge to persistently perform judicial duties in an incompetent manner); and\r\n    Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate Judgeâ€™s\r\n    Oath of Office).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall neither seek nor accept\r\n  any judicial office in this State without the express written permission of the\r\n  Court after due notice in writing to ODC.Â  Accordingly, respondent is hereby\r\n  reprimanded for his misconduct.Â   \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent no longer holds judicial office.Â  A public\r\n  reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court can impose when a judge no\r\n  longer holds judicial office.Â  See In re Oâ€™Kelley, 361 S.C. 30,\r\n  603 S.E.2d 410 (2004);

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General J.\r\n  Anthony Mabry, all of Columbia, and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â Â  A jury convicted Appellant Steven C. Stanko of\r\n  murder, assault and battery with intent\r\n  to kill, criminal sexual conduct, two counts of kidnapping, and armed robbery\r\n  and recommended Appellant be sentenced to\r\n  death.Â  In his appeal, Appellant raises issues regarding 1) the limitation of\r\n  the scope of voir dire and 2) the omission of a statutory mitigating\r\n  factor from the jury charges in the penalty phase.Â  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nThis case arises out of two brutal attacks in a string\r\n  of violent crimes committed in Georgetown County.Â  The State alleged Appellant strangled\r\n  his girlfriend and attempted to murder her daughter by slitting her throat in\r\n  the course of a robbery and sexual assault of the two women.Â  At trial,\r\n  Appellant did not deny committing the crimes, but alleged that he was insane.Â \r\n \r\nDuring voir dire,\r\n  Appellant attempted to question a potential juror as to her views on the\r\n  insanity defense.Â  The State immediately objected to this line of questioning.Â \r\n  The trial judge sustained the objection and ruled that Appellant could ask\r\n  potential jurors whether they could consider affirmative defenses â€œand list them\r\n  all,â€ but could not ask jurors whether they would consider the specific\r\n  affirmative defense of insanity.Â  After the parties discussed the issue, Appellant\r\n  indicated he was â€œabandoningâ€ asking potential jurors questions specifically\r\n  regarding the insanity defense.Â   \r\nAfter the State\r\n  presented its case in chief, Appellant presented expert witnesses in order to\r\n  prove his insanity defense.Â  The experts testified that medical examinations of\r\n  Appellantâ€™s brain revealed a frontal lobe abnormality.Â  Three of Appellantâ€™s\r\n  experts testified that the frontal lobe abnormality impaired his ability to\r\n  control his impulses and exercise proper judgment.Â  One of Appellantâ€™s experts\r\n  testified that he was unable to distinguish between right and wrong as required\r\n  under South Carolina law.Â  See State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373\r\n  S.C. 527, 577-78, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007) (a defendant is considered legally insane if, at the time of the\r\n  offense, he lacked the capacity to distinguish moral or legal right from wrong).Â  In rebuttal, the State presented experts who testified that Appellant\r\n  was able to distinguish between right and wrong and, therefore, could be held criminally\r\n  responsible for his actions.Â  The trial court submitted a jury charge on the insanity\r\n  defense and instructed the jury that, in order to be found not guilty by reason\r\n  of insanity, Appellant had to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he\r\n  had a mental disease or defect that made him unable to distinguish right from\r\n  wrong.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-10 (2006).Â  At the conclusion of the\r\n  guilt phase, the jury declined to find Appellant not guilty by reason of\r\n  insanity and returned a guilty verdict as to all counts.\r\nThe\r\n  trial proceeded to the penalty phase, and during the conference to determine\r\n  the appropriate jury charges, the trial court informed the parties that it\r\n  intended to charge the jury on two statutory mitigating factors provided in\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2) and (6).[1]Â  Appellant did not request a charge on any additional\r\n  statutory mitigating factors and indicated that he had no objection to the jury\r\n  charges.Â   \r\nAt the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury recommended\r\n  Appellant be sentenced to death.Â  This appeal followed, and Appellant raises\r\n  the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court \r\n\t\t\terr in refusing to allow Appellant to ask potential jurors about \r\n\t\t\ttheir feelings and viewpoints concerning the defense of insanity \r\n\t\t\tduring voir dire?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court \r\n\t\t\terr in failing to instruct the jury on an additional and unrequested statutory\r\n  mitigating circumstance? \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Voir Dire\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to\r\n  question potential jurors about their feelings on the insanity defense during voir\r\n    dire.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we question whether this issue is preserved for\r\n  review.Â  After the trial court ruled that Appellant could not ask potential\r\n  jurors about their views on the insanity defense, Appellant indicated that he\r\n  was â€œabandoningâ€ this line of questioning, thereby suggesting he accepted the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  See State v.\r\n    George, 323 S.C. 496, 510, 476 S.E.2d 903,\r\n  911 (1996) (no issue is preserved for\r\n  appellate review if the objecting party accepts the trial courtâ€™s ruling and\r\n  does not contemporaneously make an additional objection).\r\nIn\r\n  any event, Appellantâ€™s argument fails on the merits.Â  The scope of voir dire and the\r\n  manner in which it is conducted are generally left to the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court.Â  State v. Wise, 359\r\n  S.C. 14, 23, 596 S.E.2d 475, 479 (2004).Â  An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error\r\n  of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343\r\n  S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  A\r\n  capital defendantâ€™s right to voir dire, while grounded in statutory law,\r\n  is also rooted in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the\r\n  United States Constitution.Â  Id.Â  To constitute reversible error, a\r\n  limitation on questioning must render the trial â€œfundamentally unfair.â€Â  Muâ€™Min\r\n    v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 431 (1991); State v. Hill, 361\r\n  S.C. 297, 308, 604 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2004).\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that he was deprived of his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury\r\n  as a result of the trial courtâ€™s ruling precluding counsel from questioning\r\n  potential jurors on their view of the insanity defense.Â  Appellant claims the\r\n  insanity defense is a controversial legal issue and that some members of the\r\n  jury may have been unable to follow the law in regard to the defense.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â   \r\nAppellant\r\n  was not entitled to ask potential jurors about their specific views of the\r\n  insanity defense during voir dire.Â  The trial court allowed Appellant to\r\n  explore the issue of affirmative defenses during voir dire, and\r\n  permitting either side to ask any more case-specific questions would have\r\n  veered close to allowing the parties to stake out a jury.Â  See State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 493, 431 S.E.2d 254,\r\n  255 n.2 (1993) (voir dire is not to be\r\n  used as a means of pre-educating or indoctrinating a jury or as a means of\r\n  impaneling a jury with particular predispositions).[2]Â  While the Sixth and Fourteenth\r\n  Amendments to the United States Constitution provide a defendant with the\r\n  constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury of his peers, this right does\r\n  not entitle a defendant to handpick a jury.Â  â€œThe\r\n  Constitution, after all, does not dictate a catechism for voir dire, but\r\n  only that the defendant be afforded an impartial jury.â€Â  Morgan v. Illinois, 504\r\n  U.S. 719, 729 (1992).  \r\nOur review\r\n  of the entire voir dire process shows the qualified jurors were\r\n  impartial, unbiased, and capable of following the law.Â  Prior to trial,\r\n  potential jurors completed a questionnaire Â indicating whether they were the\r\n  type of person who: (1) would automatically impose the death penalty; (2) would\r\n  never impose the death penalty; or (3) would listen to the evidence and apply\r\n  the law in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.Â  The trial court\r\n  excused any individual who indicated that he fell into the first or second\r\n  category.Â  The trial court asked the potential jurors if anyone had bias or\r\n  prejudice regarding the case and dismissed those who stated they could not\r\n  remain fair or unbiased.Â  Additionally, the trial court confirmed that each\r\n  qualified juror would apply the law as charged, even if they disagreed with it,\r\n  which necessarily includes the law of the insanity defense.Â  Finally, the trial\r\n  court permitted Appellant to ask potential jurors whether they would be able to\r\n  apply the law in favor of Appellant if the facts provided for a defense.Â  Appellant\r\n  presented no evidence showing the limitation of questioning impacted his right\r\n  to a fair and impartial jury and failed to present evidence that the jury was\r\n  biased or incapable of following instructions on the law.Â  Accordingly, under\r\n  the facts of this case, there is no indication that Appellantâ€™s trial was\r\n  rendered â€œfundamentally unfairâ€ by the trial courtâ€™s limit of voir dire.Â  \r\n \r\nIn conclusion,\r\n  contrary to the dissentâ€™s view, our holding in no way imposes an absolute ban on\r\n  questioning jurors about their views on the insanity defense.Â  Rather, we hold that\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling limiting the scope of voir dire did not deprive\r\n  Appellant of a fair trial.Â   \r\nII. Mitigating Factor Charge\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the\r\n  statutory mitigating circumstance provided in Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(7): â€œThe age or\r\n  mentality of the defendant at the time of the crime.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Victor, 300 S.C. 220, 224, 387 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1989), we set forth the\r\n  proper procedure for submission of statutory mitigating factors to the jury in\r\n  the penalty phase of a capital case:\r\n\r\n\tOnce\r\n  the trial judge has made an initial determination of which statutory mitigating\r\n  circumstances are supported by the evidence, the defendant shall be given an\r\n  opportunity on the record: (1) to waive the submission of those he does not\r\n  wish considered by the jury; and (2) to request any additional mitigating\r\n  statutory circumstances supported by the evidence that he wishes submitted to\r\n  the jury.\r\n\r\nAbsent a request by counsel\r\n  to charge a mitigating circumstance at trial, the issue of whether the\r\n  mitigator should have been charged is not preserved\r\n  for review.Â  State\r\n    v. Evans, 371\r\n  S.C. 27, 32, 637 S.E.2d 313, 315 (2006). Â \r\nIn this case,\r\n  after the trial court informed the parties that it would charge the mitigating\r\n  factors in Â§Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2) and (6), Appellant stated that he had no\r\n  objection to the decision and did not request that the court charge any\r\n  additional statutory mitigating factors.Â  Moreover, after charging the jury,\r\n  Appellant indicated he had no objection to the charge.Â  Accordingly, this issue\r\n  is not preserved for our review.Â   \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  any preservation issues, we note that Appellant was not prejudiced by the\r\n  absence of this statutory mitigating factor.Â  Appellantâ€™s mental condition was\r\n  the focus of the guilt phase and was also a main issue in the penalty phase.Â  The\r\n  jury heard extensive expert testimony regarding Appellantâ€™s alleged mental\r\n  disorders, and the trial court charged the jury on two other mitigating factors\r\n  through which they could consider Appellantâ€™s mental condition.Â  Thus, the jury\r\n  was clearly aware that they could consider Appellantâ€™s mentality in determining\r\n  whether the death sentence was warranted.Â  In spite of this evidence, the jury\r\n  found the existence of five statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt and recommended Appellant be sentenced to death.Â  Therefore, the absence\r\n  of this statutory mitigating factor did not preclude the jury from considering\r\n  Appellantâ€™s mentality in the penalty phase, and there is no reasonable\r\n  probability that had the trial court charged the jury on this additional\r\n  mitigating factor, the jury would have returned a different recommendation.[3] Â See Jones v. State, 332 S.C. 329, 339, 504 S.E.2d 822, 827 (1998)\r\n  (finding no prejudice by the absence of an additional statutory mitigating\r\n  factor on mental state where the issue of defendantâ€™s mental condition was\r\n  clearly before the jury, the trial court charged several other mitigating\r\n  factors relating to mental condition, and the jury found the existence of five\r\n  aggravating factors).Â   \r\n\r\nProportionality Review\r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003), we have conducted a proportionality review and find\r\n  the death sentence was not the\r\n  result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.Â  Furthermore, a\r\n  review of similar cases illustrates that imposing the death sentence in this\r\n  case would be neither excessive nor disproportionate in light of the crime and\r\n  the defendant. Â See State v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d 904 (2007)\r\n  (death sentence warranted where defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping,\r\n  criminal sexual assault, and grand larceny); State v. Simmons, 360\r\n  S.C. 33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004) (death sentence upheld\r\n  where jury found aggravating factors of criminal\r\n  sexual conduct, kidnapping, armed\r\n  robbery, physical torture, and burglary); State v. Whipple, 324\r\n  S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996) (death sentence upheld\r\n  where defendant was convicted of murder, criminal sexual conduct,\r\n  armed robbery, and grand larceny of a motor vehicle).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we affirm Appellantâ€™s convictions and sentence.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, a capital\r\n  defendant who will interpose a diminished capacity or insanity defense is\r\n  entitled to voir dire the jurors whether they entertain any bias against\r\n  such a defense.Â  In fact, this Court has already recognized the appropriateness\r\n  of such inquiry.Â  SeeÂ  State v. Poindexter, 314 S.C. 490, 431\r\n  S.E.2d 254 (1993), footnote 2.Â  The trial judge, of course, must be careful not\r\n  to allow such questioning to veer into improper â€œpre-educating or\r\n  indoctrinating,â€ but I cannot agree with the majorityâ€™s absolute ban.Â \r\n  Moreover, I am not clear what evidence the majority believes was available to\r\n  appellant to demonstrate either the impact of the denial of his voir dire request, or that the jury was in fact biased or incapable of following the\r\n  instructions.Â  Having been denied the opportunity to probe potential jurorsâ€™\r\n  bias, I would not require that appellant demonstrate its existence in order to\r\n  obtain relief.Â Â   \r\nI agree with the\r\n  majority that the issue whether the jury should have been charged on the\r\n  statutory mitigating circumstance found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (C)(b)(7)\r\n  is not preserved for our review and therefore the merits should not be\r\n  addressed on direct appeal.Â  State v. Stone, S.C. Sup. Ct. Op. No. 26408\r\n  filedÂ  December 20, 2007.Â  Moreover, since South Carolina is not a â€œweighingâ€\r\n  state, State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004), the fact\r\n  that the jury found five statutory aggravators is simply not relevant to\r\n  whether appellant was prejudiced by the absence of a single mitigator, and I\r\n  specifically decline to join that part of the majorityâ€™s decision which cites\r\n  this as a fact in support of its decision to affirm the unpreserved issue.\r\nI would reverse\r\n  appellantâ€™s convictions and sentences, and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n[1] These mitigating factors provide: â€œThe murder was\r\n  committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional\r\n  disturbanceâ€ and â€œ[t]he capacity of the\r\n  defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his\r\n  conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2) and (6).\r\n[2] We disagree with the dissent that Poindexter stands for the proposition\r\n  that questioning jurors about their bias against the insanity defense is\r\n  appropriate.Â  Nonetheless, the issue in this case is not whether it is\r\n  appropriate, but rather, the issue is whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling\r\n  precluding such questioning rendered Appellantâ€™s trial â€œfundamentally unfair.â€Â  See Hill, 361 at 310, 604 S.E.2d at 703 (affirming trial courtâ€™s ruling that\r\n  limited voir dire questioning where such limitation did not render the\r\n  defendantâ€™s trial fundamentally unfair).\r\n[3] We do not base our finding of no prejudice on the fact that the jury found the\r\n  existence of five aggravating factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26443","title":"Fields v.

Haynes Waters Builders, the builder of the home (â€œthe\r\n  Builderâ€); Dryvit Systems, Inc., the manufacturer of the E.I.F.S. used on the\r\n  home; and Mahoney Brothers, Inc., the subcontractors who installed the\r\n  E.I.F.S.Â  Roughly two months prior to trial, the parties attempted to resolve\r\n  the case through mediation.Â  During mediation, the Fields settled their claims\r\n  against Dryvit and Mahoney Brothers.Â  Thus, by the time of trial, the Builder\r\n  was the only remaining defendant.\r\nAt bottom, several issues in this appeal arise out of\r\n  the Fieldsâ€™ decision to repair their home prior to trial.Â  The parties entered\r\n  into two separate scheduling orders leading up to the trial in this case, and\r\n  the scheduling order in effect during the summer of 2004 called for discovery\r\n  to end by August 1st and set the matter for trial on or after October 4th.Â  On\r\n  July 30th, two days before discovery was to be complete, the Fields notified\r\n  the defendants of their intention to immediately remove the E.I.F.S. from the\r\n  home.Prior\r\n  to trial, the Builder sought to exclude a great deal of testimony and evidence\r\n  related to the inspections and repairs of the Fieldsâ€™ home.Â  As a basis for\r\n  excluding the removal and repair costs from trial, the Builder asserted that\r\n  the Fields violated the scheduling order by removing the E.I.F.S. and repairing\r\n  the home past the orderâ€™s discovery deadline.Â  As a basis for preventing the\r\n  initial inspector of the home and the repair contractor from testifying, the\r\n  Builder argued that both the inspector and the general contractor had violated South Carolinaâ€™s laws relating to the licensing and permissible work of home inspectors and\r\n  general contractors.Â  While the trial court permitted the Fieldsâ€™ repair\r\n  contractor to testify and admitted the evidence of removal and repair costs,\r\n  the trial court found that the initial inspector of the Fieldsâ€™ home was not\r\n  qualified to testify as an expert.\r\nThe\r\n  Builder also sought extensive discovery regarding the costs of the repairs to\r\n  the Fieldsâ€™ home.Â  The partiesâ€™ seeking of discovery beyond the deadline set in\r\n  the scheduling order became the subject of considerable disagreement prior to\r\n  and during trial.Â  This disagreement resulted in several motions to compel\r\n  discovery and in the trial courtâ€™s admission and exclusion of several items of\r\n  evidence and types of testimony.Â  Most notably, the trial court allowed the\r\n  Builder to present expert testimony analyzing the repair costs the Fields\r\n  incurred in removing the E.I.F.S. from their home.Â  This testimony included an\r\n  analysis of the Fieldsâ€™ repair contractorâ€™s material costs, overhead, and\r\n  profit margin.\r\nThe\r\n  case went to trial in March 2005.Â  Although the Fields asserted eight causes of\r\n  action in their complaint, the Fields tried the case on causes of action for\r\n  negligence, breach of express warranties, breach of the implied warranty of\r\n  workmanlike service, and strict liability.[1]Â \r\n  At the close of the Fieldsâ€™ case in chief, the trial court granted the Builder\r\n  a directed verdict as to the Fieldsâ€™ express warranty and strict liability\r\n  claims.Â  The case proceeded to verdict on the claims for negligence and breach\r\n  of the implied warranty of workmanlike service, and the jury returned a verdict\r\n  in favor of the Fields.Â  The jury awarded $6,000 in damages, and the Fields appealed.\r\nThis\r\n  Court certified the case from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR, and the Fields raise the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court \r\n\t\t\terr in (A) failing to qualify one of the Fieldsâ€™ potential witnesses \r\n\t\t\tas an expert on the basis that the witness failed to comply with \r\n\t\t\tSouth Carolinaâ€™s home inspection licensing requirements, or (B) \r\n\t\t\texcluding a second bid for the repair of the Fieldsâ€™ home as \r\n\t\t\tinadmissible hearsay?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court \r\n\t\t\terr in charging the jury (A) that a general contractor is not \r\n\t\t\tautomatically liable for the negligence of a subcontractor, (B) \r\n\t\t\tregarding the licensing requirements for home inspectors and general \r\n\t\t\tcontractors, or (C) regarding the acceptance of a product with a \r\n\t\t\tpatent defect?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court \r\n\t\t\terr in directing a verdict in favor of the Builder on the Fieldsâ€™ \r\n\t\t\tclaim for strict liability?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court \r\n\t\t\terr in allowing testimony and evidence regarding the Fieldsâ€™ repair \r\n\t\t\tcontractorâ€™s costs and profit margin?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court \r\n\t\t\terr in failing to order a new trial, a new trial nisi additur, or grant judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. Exclusion of Testimony and Evidence\r\n(A) The Inspectorâ€™s Qualification as an Expert\r\nThe Fields argue that the\r\n  trial court erred in finding that Bill Flaherty, the initial inspector of the\r\n  Fieldsâ€™ home, was not qualified to testify as an expert witness on the basis\r\n  that Flaherty failed to comply with South Carolinaâ€™s home inspection licensing\r\n  requirements.Â  We agree, but we ultimately find that the error was harmless.\r\nA person may be qualified as\r\n  an expert based upon â€œknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.â€Â \r\n  Rule 702, SCRE.Â  The qualification of a witness as an expert is a matter\r\n  largely within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed absent an\r\n  abuse of that discretion.Â  Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C.\r\n  248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision is based upon an error of law or upon factual findings\r\n  that are without evidentiary support.Â  Id.\r\nOur fairly recent decision in Baggerly v. CSX Transportation, Inc., is instructive.Â  370 S.C. 362, 635\r\n  S.E.2d 97 (2006).Â  In Baggerly, this Court addressed a conflict between\r\n  Rule 702â€™s qualifications for experts and a statute that defined the practice\r\n  of engineering to include the offering of expert technical testimony.Â  Id. at 374-75, 635 S.E.2d at 103-04.Â  Although the Court noted that the practice of\r\n  engineering statute appeared to contain more specific requirements regarding\r\n  expert testimony than Rule 702, the Court held that it would not interpret the\r\n  statute to require that a person offering expert testimony in the field of\r\n  engineering be licensed as a professional engineer.Â  Id.Â  In the Courtâ€™s\r\n  words, a contrary interpretation would â€œradically alter[]â€ the landscape of\r\n  qualifying expert testimony.Â  Id.\r\nThis\r\n  case throws an important aspect of our decision in Baggerly into sharp\r\n  focus.Â  Baggerly properly recognizes that local licensing requirements\r\n  are arguably inconsistent with Rule 702â€™s operational framework for expert\r\n  testimony.Â  Rule 702 does not contain a set of mandatory qualifications that a\r\n  witness must meet in order to be qualified as an expert.Â  Instead, Rule 702\r\n  recognizes that there are a variety of ways in which a person can become so\r\n  skilled or knowledgeable in a field that their opinion in a scientific,\r\n  technical, or specialized area can assist the trier of fact in determining a\r\n  fact or in understanding the evidence.Â  Because a specific licensing\r\n  requirement is potentially inconsistent with the variety of ways a person may\r\n  gain specialized knowledge, Baggerly recognizes that a trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision to refuse to qualify a person as an expert based solely on the failure\r\n  to meet a licensing requirement arguably impairs the truth-seeking function of\r\n  courts.\r\nAt\r\n  the same time, however, this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence emphasizes the role of the\r\n  trial court as the gatekeeper in determining both the qualifications of an\r\n  expert and whether the expertâ€™s testimony will assist the trier of fact.Â  See State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 20, 515 S.E.2d 508, 518 (1999).Â \r\n  While Baggerly makes it clear that non-compliance with licensing\r\n  requirements or with the statutory law in specialized areas should not require, a fortiori, a trial court to refuse to qualify a witness as an expert, Baggerly does not stand for the proposition that a trial court should not consider\r\n  these factors when judging a purported expertâ€™s qualifications.Â  Instead, Baggerly supports the notion that in determining a witnessâ€™s qualification as an\r\n  expert, the trial court should make an inquiry broad in scope.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the trial court ought to take into account the factors delineated in the rules\r\n  of evidence, the statutory law, and any other sources of authority that may be\r\n  relevant to a purported expert witnessâ€™s level of skill or knowledge; and the\r\n  trial court must further determine whether the offered testimony will assist\r\n  the trier of fact.Â  In this case, the trial court appears to only have considered\r\n  the fact that Flaherty did not have the required license from the State of South Carolina.Â  In our view, the trial court cannot have such a solitary focus.Â  Although\r\n  lack of licensing and violations of statutory law may often coincide with a\r\n  lack of specialized skill or knowledge, these attributes are not always\r\n  bedfellows.[2]\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to qualify\r\n  Flaherty, the initial inspector of the Fieldsâ€™ home, as an expert.\r\nThis\r\n  finding does not end our analysis on this issue, however, because to warrant\r\n  reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appealing party\r\n  must show both the error of the ruling and prejudice.Â  Fields v. Reg. Med.\r\n    Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).Â  Prejudice is\r\n  a reasonable probability that the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the\r\n  challenged evidence or the lack thereof.Â  Id.Â  In this case, the Builder\r\n  argues that if the trial court erred in finding that Flaherty was not qualified\r\n  to testify as an expert, the error was harmless because the expertâ€™s testimony would\r\n  have been cumulative.Â  We agree.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, the Fields presented the testimony of their repair contractor, David\r\n  Bennett.Â  The trial court qualified Bennett as an expert in residential home\r\n  building and in E.I.F.S. application, and Bennett testified that the E.I.F.S.\r\n  on the Fieldsâ€™ house allowed a substantial amount of moisture into the home,\r\n  that the E.I.F.S. had to be removed to determine the extent of the damage, that\r\n  he had never seen E.I.F.S. installed correctly, and that the Builder breached\r\n  the standard of care for a general contractor in several particulars.Â  The\r\n  Fields also presented the testimony of a forensic architect, Dale Marshall, at\r\n  trial.Â  The trial court qualified Marshall as an expert in the standard of care\r\n  for general contractors and in the area of forensic examination and repair of\r\n  residential construction.Â  Marshall provided testimony that was substantially\r\n  similar to Bennettâ€™s and he specifically testified that the Fieldsâ€™ decision to\r\n  remove the E.I.F.S. from their home was reasonable.\r\nThe\r\n  record suggests that had he been qualified as an expert, Flaherty would have testified\r\n  that the E.I.F.S. was allowing moisture to enter and damage the Fieldsâ€™ home,\r\n  that the Builder failed to properly install the E.I.F.S., and that it was\r\n  necessary for the Fields to remove the E.I.F.S. from their home.Â  This\r\n  testimony clearly would have been cumulative to the testimony of both Bennett\r\n  and Marshall.Â  Beyond the plain similarities of the testimonies, this\r\n  conclusion is further exhibited by the fact that following the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling that Flaherty was not qualified to testify as an expert, the Fields\r\n  argued that Marshall would testify to â€œessentially the same thingsâ€ found in\r\n  Flahertyâ€™s report.Â  It is also instructive that although the trial court ruled\r\n  that Flaherty could not testify as an expert, the trial court additionally\r\n  ruled that other experts would be permitted to say that they relied on his report\r\n  in reaching their conclusions.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that the trial court erred in refusing to qualify Flaherty as an expert\r\n  witness, but that the error was harmless.\r\n(B) The Second Repair Estimate\r\nThe\r\n  Fields argue that the trial court erred in excluding a second estimate for the\r\n  Fieldsâ€™ home repairs as inadmissible hearsay.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule\r\n  801(c), SCRE, defines hearsay as â€œa statement, other than one made by the\r\n  declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to\r\n  prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Hearsay is not admissible except as\r\n  provided by the rules of evidence or other rules prescribed by this Court or by\r\n  statute.Â  Rule 802, SCRE.\r\nPart\r\n  of the Builderâ€™s strategy at trial was to attack the reasonableness of the\r\n  costs the Fields incurred in removing the E.I.F.S. and in repairing the home.Â \r\n  To combat this effort, the Fields sought to introduce, through the testimony of\r\n  James Fields, evidence regarding the amount of an alternative estimate for the\r\n  removal and repair work on the Fieldsâ€™ home.Â  The trial court excluded the\r\n  evidence, reasoning that the alternative estimate was hearsay when offered\r\n  through James Fields.Â  On appeal, the Fields argue that the alternative\r\n  estimate is not hearsay, but is a statement containing non-hearsay â€œwords of\r\n  contract.â€\r\nThe\r\n  Fieldsâ€™ argument based on â€œwords of contractâ€ derives from the principle that\r\n  not all words or utterances are offered for the truth of the matter asserted.Â \r\n  6Â  John Henry Wigmore, Evidence in\r\n  Trials at Common Law Â§ 1766 (1976) [hereinafter Wigmore on Evidence].Â  For example, in some scenarios, words\r\n  or utterances themselves from an out of court declarant may, regardless of\r\n  their truth, accompany an ambiguous act and give the act legal significance, be\r\n  used circumstantially, such as to show a state of mind, or form part of an\r\n  issue in a case.Â  Id.\r\nTraditionally\r\n  â€œwords of contractâ€ were excluded from the prohibition of hearsay as utterances\r\n  containing specific words forming part of the issue.Â  Wigmore on Evidence Â§ 1770.Â  Examples of such words or utterances include words accompanying the\r\n  making of a contract, utterances evidencing a promise to marry, words\r\n  accompanying the performance of a contract, words charged as a libel or\r\n  slander, words evidencing the fact of sending notice, and words evidencing\r\n  reputation.Â  Id.Â  Again, these words or utterances are not defined as\r\n  hearsay because they are not offered to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted.Â  Id.Â  Instead, their utterance is itself a part of the issue\r\n  litigated.Â  Id.Â   \r\nIn this case, it is clear\r\n  that the second estimate for the Fieldsâ€™ home repairs, provided by a company\r\n  called Prime South, does not qualify as non-hearsay â€œwords of contract.â€Â  We\r\n  believe it is instructive to focus on two aspects of this issue.Â  First, the\r\n  Fields did not enter into a contract with Prime South.Â  Thus, because no\r\n  contract exists between these parties, there can be no verbal assertions\r\n  offered to interpret a contract.Â  But more importantly, the issue regarding the\r\n  Fieldsâ€™ repair costs is not whether the Fields believed the costs were\r\n  reasonable, but whether the costs were in fact reasonable, and whether the\r\n  Fields exercised due care in determining that the costs were reasonable.Â  See\r\n    May v. Hopkinson, 289 S.C. 549, 559, 347 S.E.2d 508, 514 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n  (recognizing that the reasonable cost of repairs is competent and probative\r\n  evidence on the issue of damages).Â   \r\nThe relevant question in the\r\n  hearsay analysis is what the Prime South document is offered to assert.Â  The\r\n  document is not offered as proof that Prime South simply offered to repair the\r\n  Fieldsâ€™ home.Â  Instead, the Fields offered the document to show that Prime\r\n  South offered to repair the home for a specific price and that the price\r\n  offered was reasonable.Â  This assertion is classic hearsay when offered by an\r\n  out of court declarant, and the trial court properly excluded the statement\r\n  from evidence.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the\r\n  trial court did not err in excluding a second bid for the Fieldsâ€™ home repairs.\r\nII. Jury\r\n  Charges\r\nA jury charge is correct if\r\n  the charge, when read as a whole, adequately covers the current and correct\r\n  law.Â  Keaton ex. rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488,\r\n  495-96, 514 S.E.2d 570, 574 (1999).Â  To warrant\r\n  reversal on appeal, the trial courtâ€™s instructions must be not only erroneous,\r\n  but must also be prejudicial.Â  Id.\r\n(A) General Contractorâ€™s Standard of Care\r\nThe\r\n  Fields argue that, in South Carolina, a general contractor is â€œautomatically\r\n  responsibleâ€ for the negligence of a subcontractor.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  the context of their cause of action for negligence, the Fieldsâ€™ argument on\r\n  this issue seems misguided.Â  The Fields argue that the trial court should have\r\n  charged a theory of automatic liability, but that the trial court also properly\r\n  charged the jury that â€œ[a]ny failure to exercise due care on the part of [the\r\n  Builder] . . . would constitute negligence;â€ that â€œ[a] builder who undertakes\r\n  construction of a building impliedly represents that he possesses and will\r\n  exercise a reasonable degree of skill usually possessed by a member of the\r\n  building occupation;â€ and that â€œ[a] builder who undertakes to supervise the\r\n  construction of a building is under a duty to exercise reasonable care and such\r\n  supervision to see that the work is done in conformity with the applicable\r\n  building code . . . and in a good and workmanlike manner.â€Â  In our view, it\r\n  would have been wildly inconsistent for the trial court to charge that a\r\n  general contractor must exercise only the degree of care reasonably expected in\r\n  the industry in constructing and supervising the construction of the Fieldsâ€™\r\n  home, and in the same breath to have charged that a general contractor is\r\n  automatically liable for any negligence associated with the construction.Â  Liability\r\n  attaching â€œautomatically,â€ in our opinion, seems more like strict liability\r\n  than negligence.\r\nThe\r\n  Fieldsâ€™ argument on this issue appears more applicable in the context of\r\n  their claim for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike\r\n  service.Â  Beginning in Rutledge v. Dodenhoff, 254 S.C. 407, 175 S.E.2d\r\n  792 (1970), and extending through this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence as evidenced in Lane\r\n    v. Trenholm Bldg. Co., 267 S.C. 497, 229 S.E.2d 728 (1976), and Kennedy\r\n      v. Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.C. 335, 384 S.E.2d 730\r\n  (1989), this Court has embraced the notion that in constructing a home, a\r\n  builder warrants that the home is fit for its intended use as a dwelling, that\r\n  the home was constructed in a workmanlike manner, and that the home is free of\r\n  latent defects.Â  This warranty extends not only to the original purchasers of\r\n  the home, with whom the builder is in privity, but to subsequent purchasers who\r\n  may pursue a cause of action in contract or tort against a builder for a\r\n  reasonable period after the homeâ€™s construction.Â  Terlinde v. Neeley,\r\n  275 S.C. 395, 397, 271 S.E.2d 768, 769 (1980).\r\nThe flaw in the Fieldsâ€™\r\n  argument on this issue is a result of their incorrect blending of the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s charges on negligence with this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence in the area of\r\n  warranty liability regarding the sales of homes.Â  Regarding the warranty of\r\n  workmanlike service, the trial court charged the jury that a builder must build\r\n  a home â€œin an ordinarily skillful manner as a skilled workman would do the\r\n  work,â€ and that â€œ[t]he builder is required to complete the construction that is\r\n  expected of living quarters of comparable kind and quality.â€Â  Just as the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s charges on negligence correctly stated the law of negligence, these\r\n  charges correctly stated the law regarding the warranty of workmanlike\r\n  service.Â  By using this Courtâ€™s warranty jurisprudence to analyze the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s charges on negligence, the Fieldsâ€™ improperly assert that the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s charges were inaccurate.Â  In the instant case, the trial court charged\r\n  the jury that the Builder was required to construct a home commensurate with\r\n  the standard expected of living quarters.Â  As we have outlined, this properly\r\n  stated the law of workmanlike service.\r\nA final point is instructive\r\n  regarding these jury charges.Â  In the instant case, two central issues at trial were the identification of the\r\n  standards of care for a general contractor supervising the application of\r\n  E.I.F.S. and whether the damage caused by moisture intrusion into the Fieldsâ€™\r\n  home was the result of contractor negligence, a design defect, or the Fieldsâ€™\r\n  failure to maintain the home.Â  The parties presented conflicting testimony\r\n  regarding each of these questions.Â  While the Fieldsâ€™ experts testified that\r\n  E.I.F.S. was a defective product and thus required perfect caulking and\r\n  sealing, the Builder provided expert testimony that it supervised the\r\n  installation of the E.I.F.S. in accordance with the building code applicable at\r\n  the time, in a manner consistent with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions and in\r\n  the industry at the time, and that the vast majority of the damage was\r\n  attributable to the Fieldsâ€™ failure to maintain their home.Â  In this case, the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s charges to the jury accurately summarized the law, and\r\n  appropriately left to the jury the tasks of determining the appropriate\r\n  standard of care and the cause of the damage to the Fieldsâ€™ home.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in charging the jury\r\n  regarding the standard of care for a general contractor.\r\n(B) Licensing Requirements\r\n  for Inspectors and Contractors\r\nThe Fields\r\n  argue that the trial court erred in charging the jury regarding the licensing\r\n  requirements for home inspectors and general contractors.Â  We disagree.\r\nOne of the Builderâ€™s primary strategies at\r\n  trial was to attack the Fieldsâ€™ experts, their qualifications, and the\r\n  contractors that the Fields used to repair their home.Â  The trial court\r\n  ultimately charged the jury regarding several licensing requirements applicable\r\n  to home inspectors, general contractors, and subcontractors in South Carolina.Â  These statutes dealt specifically with statutory requirements for a home\r\n  inspection report identifying a construction defect in a home, the statutory\r\n  prohibition of a person who identifies a defect in a home inspection from\r\n  performing repair work on the home, and the use and supervision of unlicensed\r\n  specialty subcontractors.\r\nOf course, it was completely reasonable for\r\n  the Builder to attack the Fieldsâ€™ experts by raising questions regarding their\r\n  compliance with the statutory and regulatory law.Â  See Peterson v. Natâ€™l.\r\n    R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 399, 618 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2005)\r\n  (recognizing that defects in an expert witnessâ€™s education and experience go to\r\n  the weight of the expertâ€™s testimony).Â  Thus, it was also proper for the trial\r\n  court to charge the jury as to the statutory law in these areas.Â  That a\r\n  witness has been qualified as an expert does not mean that the witnessâ€™s\r\n  credibility and the accuracy of his conclusions are beyond reproach.Â  If the\r\n  statutory law provides a rubric by which an expertâ€™s credibility may be judged,\r\n  it is proper for the jury to use the statutes to make credibility\r\n  determinations.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the\r\n  trial court did not err in charging the jury regarding the licensing\r\n  requirements for home inspectors and contractors.\r\n(C) Patent\r\n  Defects Charge\r\nThe Fields argue that the trial court erred\r\n  in charging the jury regarding the law of acceptance of patent defects.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe portion of the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s charge to which the Fields object occurred during the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  charges regarding the Builderâ€™s statute of limitations defense.Â  The trial\r\n  court charged the jury that the law requires a plaintiff to bring a claim for\r\n  breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service within three years of\r\n  when the plaintiff either knew or through the exercise of reasonable diligence\r\n  should have known that he had a claim.Â  In this context, the trial court\r\n  charged the jury that a person who accepts property with a patent defect waives\r\n  claims arising out of that defect, and that the law thus only protects the\r\n  purchaser from defects that a reasonably careful inspection would not reveal.Â  \r\n \r\nThis charge was relevant to\r\n  the Builderâ€™s defense that if the E.I.F.S. on the Fieldsâ€™ home was allowing\r\n  moisture to enter the home, a pre-purchase home inspection would have\r\n  discovered this latent defect.Â  The Builder argued that by failing to have the\r\n  home inspected prior to purchasing the home, the Fields were barred from suing\r\n  on the breach of warranty cause of action by the three year statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  The parties offered conflicting testimony at trial as to the\r\n  circumstances leading up to the Fieldsâ€™ purchase of the home. Â While the Fields\r\n  testified that the Builder met them at the home with the original owners,\r\n  conducted a detailed walk-through of the home, and made several representations\r\n  about the quality of the home, the Builder testified that he lived in the same\r\n  neighborhood and that his interaction with the Fields was simply a chance\r\n  encounter between future neighbors.\r\nAs this review of the\r\n  evidence and arguments at trial demonstrates, the parties disputed whether the\r\n  Builder made representations which caused the Fields to forego having the home\r\n  inspected prior to their purchasing it and whether the Fields were themselves\r\n  unreasonable in failing to have the home inspected prior to purchase.Â  In light\r\n  of these disputes, the trial courtâ€™s charge was relevant to an issue in the\r\n  case, and the charge was not otherwise confusing or misleading.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the\r\n  trial court did not err in charging the jury regarding the law of acceptance of\r\n  patent defects.\r\nIII. Strict\r\n  Liability\r\nThe Fields argue that the\r\n  trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the Builder on the Fieldsâ€™\r\n  claim for strict liability.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court may direct a\r\n  verdict in favor of a party where there are no material facts in dispute and\r\n  the case presents only a question of law.Â  Rule 50(a), SCRCP; AMA Mgmt.\r\n    Corp. v. Strasburger, 309 S.C. 213, 221, 420 S.E.2d 868, 873 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  The question of whether South Carolinaâ€™s strict liability statute covers a\r\n  general contractor supervising the construction of a home is a question of law,\r\n  and this Court reviews questions of law de novo.Â  Catawba Indian Tribe v.\r\n    State, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).\r\nIn pertinent part, the strict\r\n  liability statute provides that â€œ[o]ne who sells any product in a defective\r\n  condition . . . is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the\r\n  ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if [t]he seller is in the\r\n  business of selling such a product.â€Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 (2005).Â  In South Carolina, it is firmly established that the strict liability statute applies only to\r\n  sales of products and not to the provision of services.Â  See In re Breast\r\n    Implant Prod. Liab. Litig., 331 S.C. 540, 546, 503 S.E.2d 445, 448 (1998)\r\n  (citing Samson v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 297 S.C. 409, 377 S.E.2d 311\r\n  (1989)).Â  For this reason, the relevant question in this case is whether a\r\n  contractor provides a product or services.\r\nIn determining whether\r\n  certain types of vendors or professionals offer services or products within the\r\n  meaning of the strict liability statute, this Court has focused on the\r\n  character of the underlying transaction, the law regarding similar transactions\r\n  in other jurisdictions, and the policy arguments in favor of imposing strict\r\n  liability in a given situation.Â  This Court has determined that both\r\n  pharmacists who fill prescriptions pursuant to a physicianâ€™s instructions and\r\n  health care providers who perform breast implant procedures offer services and\r\n  are thus not subject to liability under the strict liability statute.Â  See Madison v. Am. Home Products Corp., 358 S.C. 449, 456, 595 S.E.2d 493, 496 (2004)\r\n  (pharmacists); In re Breast Implant Prod. Liab. Litig., 331 S.C. at 551,\r\n  503 S.E.2d at 451.[3]\r\nIn our view, a general\r\n  contractor building a home performs a service and does not sell a product.Â \r\n  Professors Prosser and Keeton have recognized that â€œ[t]he transaction of the\r\n  building contractor has generally been regarded as a transaction involving the\r\n  rendition of a service,â€ and that for these reasons, strict liability is\r\n  generally inapplicable to a general contractor. Â W. Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Â§\r\n  104A (5th ed. 1984).Â  The professors note that this is true â€œeven though the\r\n  result of the [contractorâ€™s] service is to supply a structure or building to\r\n  the owner.â€Â  Id.[4]\r\nThe Fields have not provided\r\n  any persuasive authority from a foreign jurisdiction interpreting a strict\r\n  liability statute or similar common law rule to cover a general contractor who\r\n  builds a home.Â  Although it appears that the Supreme Court of Nevada adopted\r\n  this interpretation at one time, see Worrell v. Barnes, 484 P.2d 573,\r\n  576 (1971), the court has since abandoned that rule.Â  See Calloway v. City\r\n    of Reno, 993 P.2d 1259, 1272 (2000).Â  The Nevada courtâ€™s reasons for\r\n  abandoning the rule announced in Worrell are instructive.\r\nThe Nevada court noted that\r\n  tracing a defective product used in a home to a manufacturer or a supplier\r\n  generally poses no significant problem.Â  Id. at 1271.Â  This is\r\n  distinguishable, the court observed, from the situation encountered with the\r\n  remote manufacturer of a product traveling in interstate commerce.Â  Id.Â  The Nevada court further noted that a builder is generally not able to limit\r\n  his liability by warranties and disclaimers, and that most buildings are\r\n  one-of-a-kind, requiring methods and materials that change with each product.Â  Id.Â  For these reasons, the Nevada court held that the marriage of a contractor with\r\n  the strict liability encompassed by Restatement Â§ 402A was best discarded.\r\nThat the application of the\r\n  strict liability statute to a contractor is unnecessary is exhibited by\r\n  returning to an examination of this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence regarding the implied\r\n  warranties that attach to the construction and sale of a home.Â  As Kennedy, Lane, and Rutledge recognize, implied warranties ensure that a\r\n  homebuilder in South Carolina is liable for a reasonable period of time for\r\n  latent defects in the home which impact the homeâ€™s suitability as a residence.Â \r\n  Given this extension of liability, liability under the strict liability statute\r\n  seems superfluous in this arena.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the\r\n  trial court did not err in directing a verdict on the Fieldsâ€™ claim for strict\r\n  liability.\r\nIV.\r\n  Testimony Regarding Contractor Costs &amp; Profit Margin\r\nThe Fields\r\n  argue that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the Fieldsâ€™ repair\r\n  contractorâ€™s costs and profit margin.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court, and the courtâ€™s decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at 25-26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.\r\nThe first\r\n  argument the Fields present on this issue is that the entire subject matter of\r\n  the Fieldsâ€™ repair contractorâ€™s material costs, profit margin, and other\r\n  component costs should have been excluded as prejudicial, confusing, and\r\n  misleading.Â  The Fields assert that they did not have access to this\r\n  information when hiring the repair contractor, and that it is thus unfair to\r\n  allow the reasonableness of the repair costs to be judged by the amounts of\r\n  these component costs.Â  In our view, these arguments are inaccurate.\r\nThe\r\n  critical issue regarding the Fieldsâ€™ repair costs was the reasonableness and\r\n  necessity of those costs.Â  Accordingly, the fact that the Fields did not have\r\n  access to Bennettâ€™s material costs, overhead, and profit margin is irrelevant\r\n  to a determination of whether Bennettâ€™s costs were reasonable and necessary.Â \r\n  Again, the relevant question is not whether the Fields believed that Bennettâ€™s\r\n  costs were reasonable, but whether the costs were in fact reasonable.Â  See\r\n    May, 289 S.C. at 559, 347 S.E.2d at 514 (recognizing that the reasonable\r\n  cost of repairs is competent and probative evidence on the issue of damages).\r\nThe\r\n  testimony resulting from an examination of Bennettâ€™s component costs\r\n  illustrates the usefulness of this information.Â  The Builderâ€™s expert estimator\r\n  testified that he examined Bennettâ€™s materials invoices, purported profit\r\n  margin, and overhead for the Fieldsâ€™ repairs, and that although the expertâ€™s\r\n  examination of this information resulted in similar figures for the jobâ€™s sunk\r\n  costs, the Fields paid Bennett roughly $37,000 more than the job should have\r\n  cost given Bennettâ€™s profit and overhead.Â  While the Fields correctly recognize\r\n  that the Builder could have used (and indeed did use) another contractor to\r\n  offer additional testimony as to reasonable repair costs, the trial court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion in adding an analysis of Bennettâ€™s component costs to\r\n  this equation.\r\nAs a\r\n  second argument on this issue, the Fields argue that the trial court erred in\r\n  admitting the report prepared by Steve Wilkinson, the Builderâ€™s estimating\r\n  expert, regarding the Fieldsâ€™ repair costs.Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nThe Fields\r\n  argue that the report should have been excluded at trial because the Builder\r\n  first provided the Fields with the report on the day that Wilkinson was to\r\n  testify.Â  To combat this claim, the Builder argues that the report was based\r\n  solely on a comparison of Bennettâ€™s invoices and an accepted estimating\r\n  resource, and that the Builder had been provided with Bennettâ€™s invoices the\r\n  Friday before trial.Â  Thus, the Builder argues that the raw information\r\n  supplying the basis for the report was in the Fieldsâ€™ possession throughout the\r\n  course of the litigation, and that the expert had been working to prepare the\r\n  report until the date of his testimony.Â  In addition to these arguments, the Builder\r\n  argues that pursuant to a prior discovery order entered in the litigation, the\r\n  Builder did not have to supply the Fields with any additional discovery.\r\nIn our view, the Fields\r\n  cannot demonstrate that the introduction of Wilkinsonâ€™s report was prejudicial.[5]Â \r\n  First, because an expert is permitted to base opinion testimony on information\r\n  that is not admissible in evidence, see Rule 703, SCRE, exclusion of the\r\n  report would not necessarily have impacted Wilkinsonâ€™s ultimate opinions\r\n  regarding his view of a reasonable fee in the instant case.Â  Second, the Fields\r\n  had the opportunity to cross-examine Wilkinson regarding his report and\r\n  conclusions, re-call their experts in rebuttal, and also could have asked for a\r\n  short recess or overnight continuance to prepare for cross-examination.Â  In\r\n  these circumstances, the Fields were not, as they assert they were, precluded\r\n  from presenting expert testimony commenting on Wilkinsonâ€™s methodology.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  a finding of prejudice from the introduction of Wilkinsonâ€™s testimony seems to\r\n  us a tall order.\r\nFor these reasons, we hold\r\n  that the trial court did not err in admitting the Fieldsâ€™ repair contractorâ€™s\r\n  costs and profit.Â  We further hold that if the trial court erred in admitting\r\n  the report prepared by the Builderâ€™s estimating expert, the error was harmless.\r\nV. New\r\n  Trial, New Trial Nisi Additur, or J.N.O.V.\r\nThe Fields argue that the\r\n  trial court erred in failing to order a new trial, a new trial nisi additur, or\r\n  grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny\r\n  a motion for a new trial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court,\r\n  and the trial courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  S.C. State Highway Depâ€™t v. Clarkson, 267 S.C. 121,\r\n  126, 226 S.E.2d 696, 697 (1976).Â  On this issue, the Fields primarily argue\r\n  that the juryâ€™s verdict was grossly inadequate in light of the evidence\r\n  presented at trial.Â  In our view, the Fields do not accurately describe the\r\n  evidence.\r\nThere is ample evidence in the\r\n  record supporting the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  The Fields correctly point out that the\r\n  Builder, during cross-examination, admitted liability for one area of damage\r\n  caused by poorly installed flashing, but this was not the full extent of the\r\n  Builderâ€™s testimony.Â  The Builder also opined that only five percent of the\r\n  house had damage from moisture and that roughly three-quarters of the damages\r\n  to the home was caused by the Fieldsâ€™ failure to maintain the home.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the Builderâ€™s estimating expert opined that removing and replacing\r\n  the E.I.F.S. from all the areas for which the Builder was responsible should\r\n  have cost approximately $124,000.Â  It was, of course, possible for the jury in\r\n  this case to conclude, consistent with this testimony, that only five percent\r\n  of the house had damage and that the calculations offered by the Builderâ€™s\r\n  estimating expert represented reasonable repair costs.Â  It was thus possible\r\n  for the jury to arrive at an award of $6,000 based on evidence presented at\r\n  trial in this case.[6]\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the\r\n  trial court did not err in failing to order a new trial, a new trial nisi\r\n  additur, or grant judgment not withstanding the verdict.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  We specifically hold that:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1) \r\n\t\t\tthe trial court \r\n\t\t\terred in refusing to qualify Flaherty as an expert witness, but that \r\n\t\t\tthe error was harmless;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\tthe trial court did \r\n\t\t\tnot err in excluding a second bid for the repair of the Fieldsâ€™ home \r\n\t\t\tas inadmissible hearsay;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3) \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;the trial \r\n\t\t\tcourt did not err in charging the jury that a general contractor is \r\n\t\t\tnot automatically liable, in negligence, for the negligence of a \r\n\t\t\tsubcontractor;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4)\r\n\t\t\tthe trial court did \r\n\t\t\tnot err in charging the jury regarding the licensing requirements \r\n\t\t\tfor home inspectors and contractors;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5) \r\n\t\t\tthe trial court did \r\n\t\t\tnot err in charging the jury regarding the law of acceptance of \r\n\t\t\tpatent defects;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(6) \r\n\t\t\tthe trial court did \r\n\t\t\tnot err in directing a verdict in favor of the Builder on the \r\n\t\t\tFieldsâ€™ claim for strict liability;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(7) \r\n\t\t\tthe trial court did \r\n\t\t\tnot err in admitting evidence of the Fieldsâ€™ repair contractorâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tcosts and profit margin;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(8)\r\n\t\t\tassuming the trial \r\n\t\t\tcourt erred in admitting the report prepared by the Builderâ€™s \r\n\t\t\testimating expert, the error was harmless; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(9)\r\n\t\t\tthe trial court did \r\n\t\t\tnot err in failing to order a new trial, a new trial nisi additur, or grant judgment notwithstanding\r\n  the verdict.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER,\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1] In addition to these four causes of action, the Fields originally asserted\r\n  claims for breach of the implied warranties of habitability, merchantability,\r\n  and fitness for a particular purpose, as well as a claim for unfair trade\r\n  practices.Â  The trial court granted the Builder summary judgment on these\r\n  claims roughly one month prior to trial. Â \r\n[2] The Fields have argued both at trial and on appeal that Flaherty is a specialty\r\n  inspector and is thus not required to have a home inspectorâ€™s license to\r\n  perform inspections of the type he performed for the Fields.Â  Because\r\n  compliance with licensing requirements should not be determinative of a\r\n  purported expertâ€™s qualifications, the question of whether Flaherty is actually\r\n  required to have a home inspectorâ€™s license is irrelevant.\r\n[3] As this Court has noted, authority from other jurisdictions interpreting the\r\n  principles espoused in the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 402A is persuasive\r\n  in this determination since the General Assembly, in adopting Â§ 15-73-10,\r\n  codified the Restatement section nearly verbatim.\r\n[4] The court of appeals relied on this authority in the case Duncan v. CRS\r\n  Sirrine Engineers, Inc., 337 S.C. 537, 524 S.E.2d 115 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In\r\n  that case, the court of appeals held that a worker who fell through an open\r\n  hatch on a catwalk had no strict liability claim against the contractor who assembled\r\n  the catwalk.Â  Id. at 543 n.3, 524 S.E.2d at 118 n.3.Â  The court of\r\n  appeals held that assembly work amounted to providing a service rather than a\r\n  product.Â  Id.Â   \r\n[5] On this issue, we assume, without deciding, that the trial court erred in\r\n  admitting Wilkinsonâ€™s report.Â  In our view, the prejudice analysis in this case\r\n  is rather simple.\r\n[6] Five percent of $124,000 is actually $6,200.Â  We can only speculate as to\r\n  whether the jury performed this or some similar calculation based on the\r\n  evidence admitted at trial in this case.Â  The calculation does, however,\r\n  exhibit that there is evidentiary support for the juryâ€™s award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to 403(g), SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2008-02-21-01","description":"This is an order amending Rule 403(g), SCACR.","date":"2008-02-25","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nRE:\tAmendment to 403(g), SCACR\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPursuant to Article V, &sect; 4 of the South Carolina \r\nConstitution, Rule 403(g), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n\r\n   (g) Judge Advocate General Lawyers.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil\r\n  Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  Ronald Donald Dingle appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s order\r\n  resentencing him instead of granting him a new trial upon remand by the post-conviction\r\n  relief (PCR) court.Â  We affirm as modified.  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 22, 1992, seventeen-year-old\r\n  Dingle was charged in Sumter County with murder, first-degree burglary, assault\r\n  and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), two counts of possession of a weapon\r\n  during a violent crime, two counts of possession of a sawed-off shotgun,\r\n  pointing a firearm, first-degree burglary, and kidnapping.Â  While out on bond\r\n  in June 1993, Dingle was arrested in Lee County and charged with trafficking in\r\n  crack cocaine.Â  Dingle pled guilty to the Lee County offense in September 1993\r\n  and was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine.Â  Dingle later\r\n  became concerned about the potential effect of his Lee County conviction on his\r\n  eligibility for parole, and he filed an application for PCR.Â  The PCR court\r\n  dismissed the matter without prejudice, noting that the court handling the Sumter County charges would be better able to deal with the matter. Â \r\nIn April 1995, Dingle entered a negotiated plea of guilty to the Sumter County charges.Â  The State informed the plea court that in exchange for the plea,\r\n  Dingle would not be exposed to the death penalty and would still be eligible\r\n  for parole.Â  The plea court sentenced Dingle on the Sumter County charges to\r\n  consecutive terms of:Â  life imprisonment on each of the murder and first-degree\r\n  burglary charges; twenty years imprisonment for ABIK; five years for each count\r\n  of possession of a weapon during a violent crime; ten years for each count of\r\n  possession of a sawed-off shotgun; and five years for pointing a firearm.Â \r\n  Further, as part of the negotiated plea and to avoid ineligibility for parole\r\n  for a subsequent conviction,[1] Dingleâ€™s\r\n  prior conviction and sentence on his Lee County trafficking in crack cocaine\r\n  charge were vacated, he pled guilty again, and he was resentenced at the same\r\n  time as his plea to the Sumter County charges.Â  He was sentenced to a\r\n  concurrent term of three years and a fine of $25,000.Â  The plea judge placed on\r\n  the record the fact that the Lee County plea was part of the same sentencing\r\n  proceeding as the Sumter County plea.Â  Throughout the sentencing hearing, the\r\n  parties and the plea judge all indicated their intent that Dingle would be\r\n  eligible for parole after serving thirty years of his life sentence.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  1996, Dingle learned that he would not be eligible for parole because the Sumter County sentences were consecutive, and he filed another application for PCR.Â  After\r\n  a hearing, the PCR court issued an order in December 1997 finding Dingle pled\r\n  guilty pursuant to assurances by his counsel and by the Sumter County plea court that he would be eligible for parole after thirty years.Â  The PCR court\r\n  vacated the Sumter County sentences and remanded the matter to the circuit\r\n  court â€œfor sentencing consistent with the intent of the plea agreement or for a\r\n  new trial.â€Â  The Lee County plea and sentence were not addressed in the order.Â \r\n \r\nDingleâ€™s\r\n  case was not called for trial for several years, and he filed a motion for a\r\n  speedy trial in 2004.Â  Representatives from the Department of Probation,\r\n  Parole, and Pardon Services were present at the hearing.Â  Dingle testified that:\r\n  Â he wanted a new trial; it was his decision to make; he understood that he\r\n  could face a punishment of life without the possibility of parole if he were\r\n  convicted; he would not be eligible for parole anyway upon resentencing; and he\r\n  did not get the benefit of his bargain when the death penalty, a major\r\n  motivator in his plea decision, was later ruled unconstitutional for minors.Â  The\r\n  State indicated it would nolle pros the two gun charges that could\r\n  potentially interfere with parole eligibility so that Dingle could be eligible\r\n  for parole after thirty years.[2]Â  \r\n \r\nThe circuit court denied Dingleâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  The\r\n  court interpreted the PCR courtâ€™s order as holding that Dingle was to be â€œsent\r\n  back for resentencing in accordance with the agreement and if the State is not\r\n  willing to do that then he would be entitled to a new trial.â€Â  Despite Dingleâ€™s\r\n  arguments that he would not be eligible for parole if he were just resentenced\r\n  because the new sentencing date would constitute a â€œsubsequent offense,â€ the\r\n  court found Dingle could get the benefit of the plea bargain and it ordered the\r\n  parole board to â€œcompute Dingleâ€™s eligibility for parole on the murder\r\n  conviction as if these other convictions were either concurrent or not on his\r\n  record.â€Â  Finally, the court disagreed with Dingleâ€™s argument that he was\r\n  entitled to a new trial because the major motivating factor to plead guilty was\r\n  to avoid the death penalty, and it was later outlawed for minors pursuant to Roper\r\n    v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005).Â  The court re-imposed the original\r\n  sentences given to Dingle on the Sumter County charges, but the sentences were\r\n  to run concurrently instead of consecutively.Â  Dingleâ€™s motion to alter or\r\n  amend the judgment was denied, and he appeals.Â   \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDingle argues the circuit court abused its\r\n  discretion by not allowing him to withdraw his guilty pleas and have a new\r\n  trial because:Â  (1) resentencing him on the Sumter County convictions would\r\n  amount to a â€œsubsequent convictionâ€ such that he would be ineligible for parole\r\n  anyway; and (2) it was his choice as to whether he was resentenced or entitled\r\n  to a new trial, especially in light of the fact that he no longer had the full\r\n  benefit of the original bargain because the death penalty was later found to be\r\n  unconstitutional for minors.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn his\r\n  first argument, Dingle focuses on the language â€œsecond or subsequent\r\n  convictionâ€ in the statute to argue that resentencing him on the Sumter County charges would trigger the no-parole clause in the statute.Â  As will be\r\n  further discussed, Dingle has misinterpreted the statute.  \r\nParole\r\n  is a privilege, not a matter of right.Â  Sullivan v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\n    Corr., 355 S.C. 437, 443 n.4, 586 S.E.2d 124, 127 n.4 (2003).Â  Although a\r\n  courtâ€™s final judgment in a criminal case is the pronouncement of the sentence,\r\n  the parole board has the sole authority to determine parole eligibility\r\n  separate and apart from the courtâ€™s authority to sentence a defendant.Â  State\r\n    v. McKay, 300 S.C. 113, 115, 386 S.E.2d 623, 623-24 (1989).Â  However, the\r\n  court may order the parole board to structure a sentence in such a way as to\r\n  carry out the intent of the parties.Â  Tilley v. State, 334 S.C. 24, 28-29,\r\n  511 S.E.2d 689, 692 (1999) (ordering the parole board to consider the five-year\r\n  mandatory term for possession of a firearm as being served first such that the\r\n  prisoner would be considered eligible for parole as the parties had intended).\r\nThis Court has the authority to interpret the parole statute.Â  In\r\n  interpreting statutes, the Court looks to the plain meaning of the statute and\r\n  the intent of the Legislature.Â  Hinton v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Prob.,\r\n    Parole, &amp; Pardon Servs., 357 S.C. 327, 332, 592 S.E.2d 335, 338 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  As with any statute that is penal in nature, the Court must\r\n  construe it strictly in favor of the defendant and against the State.Â  Hair\r\n    v. State, 305 S.C. 77, 79, 406 S.E.2d 332, 334 (1991) (construing in favor\r\n  of the defendant the different time frames for parole eligibility found in the\r\n  general parole statute and in a statute regarding parole eligibility for\r\n  burglary).Â  The relevant portion of the parole statute provides:Â  â€œThe board\r\n  must not grant parole nor is parole authorized to any prisoner serving a\r\n  sentence for a second or subsequent conviction, following a separate sentencing\r\n  for a prior conviction, for violent crimes as defined in Section 16-1-60.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (2007).Â   \r\nA clear reading of the underlying statute is that in order to\r\n  trigger the no-parole language, a defendant must not only have a separate\r\n  sentencing hearing, but he or she must also have a separate conviction.Â \r\n  Dingle entered his pleas to both the Sumter County and Lee County charges in the same proceeding, and only his sentences, not his convictions,\r\n  on the Sumter County charges were overturned by the PCR court.Â  A clear reading\r\n  of the statute indicates the Legislatureâ€™s desire to punish subsequent\r\n  offenders.Â  To interpret the statute in such a way as to bar parole\r\n  consideration where, as here, the sentence alone is overturned and remanded for\r\n  resentencing would lead to an absurd result.Â  Wade v. State, 348 S.C.\r\n  255, 259, 559 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2002) (â€œHowever, a court must reject a statuteâ€™s interpretation leading to absurd results not\r\n  intended by the Legislature.â€).Â  Dingleâ€™s argument that the remand of his Sumter County sentences was a â€œsubsequent convictionâ€ rendering him ineligible for parole\r\n  is erroneous, and specific performance of the plea bargain can still be\r\n  accomplished.Â   \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the State has affirmatively stated its intent to comply with the plea bargain\r\n  and does not intend to challenge Dingleâ€™s eligibility for parole.Â  Thus, the\r\n  State, and its various agencies, would be estopped from later asserting Dingle\r\n  was ineligible for parole. Â See State v. Peake, 353 S.C. 499,\r\n  505, 579 S.E.2d 297, 300 (2003) (discussing whether the State was estopped to\r\n  prosecute a defendant based on representations made by someone regarding a\r\n  civil action).\r\nCiting\r\n  cases that deal with breaches of plea agreements, Dingle next argues that he\r\n  was entitled to choose between resentencing or a new trial because it â€œcomports\r\n  with this jurisdictionâ€™s recognition of the importance of contract principles\r\n  in resolving plea agreement disputes.â€Â  He also argues that he was entitled to\r\n  choose a trial because he could never get the benefit of the original plea\r\n  bargain where a motivating factor was to avoid a death sentence, and the death\r\n  penalty was later ruled unconstitutional for minors.  \r\nIt has\r\n  long been established that state prosecutors â€œare obligated to fulfill the\r\n  promises they make to defendants when those promises serve as inducements to\r\n  defendants to plead guilty.â€Â  Sprouse v. State, 355 S.C. 335, 338, 585\r\n  S.E.2d 278, 279 (2003) (citing Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257 (1971)).Â  Where a solicitor breaches a plea agreement, the United States Supreme\r\n  Court has indicated two remedies:Â  specific performance of the plea agreement;\r\n  or allowing the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.Â  Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63.Â  As Dingle correctly notes, although South Carolina has not ruled on\r\n  whether a defendant may elect the remedies when a solicitor breaches a plea\r\n  agreement, some jurisdictions have held that it is the defendantâ€™s right to\r\n  choose between the remedies in such a situation.Â  See State v. Munoz,\r\n  23 P.3d 922, 928 (Mont. 2001) (relying upon contract law principles to find a\r\n  â€œnon-breaching defendant must be afforded the initial right to choose from\r\n  available remedies where the State breaches a plea agreementâ€); State v.\r\n    Miller, 756 P.2d 122, 126-27 (Wash. 1988) (noting that the prosecutor\r\n  failed to carry his burden of demonstrating the defendantâ€™s choice of remedy\r\n  was unjust).Â   \r\nHowever, in the instant case, the State did not violate the terms\r\n  of the agreement:Â  in exchange for Dingleâ€™s plea, they did not seek a death\r\n  sentence and they agreed to structuring the sentence such that he would still\r\n  be parole eligible.Â  It was only the way the plea judge structured the sentence\r\n  that rendered Dingle parole ineligible.Â  Because the State did not violate the\r\n  agreement, the question of election of remedies does not apply.Â   \r\nFinally, there is no merit to Dingleâ€™s argument that he did not\r\n  get the benefit of the bargain because the death penalty later became\r\n  unconstitutional for minors.Â  See Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 575 (2005) (holding capital punishment for persons under the age of eighteen when\r\n  the crimes were committed violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments).Â \r\n  Dingle still received the benefit of his bargain when the parties agreed to\r\n  structure the sentence such that he would be parole eligible.Â  All the parties\r\n  attempted to accomplish that goal.Â  By remanding Dingleâ€™s Sumter County sentences for resentencing such that he will be parole eligible, Dingle gets the benefit\r\n  of his bargain.Â   \r\nBecause the plea agreement can faithfully be enforced and specific\r\n  performance promotes judicial economy, we find the circuit court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in ordering resentencing instead of a new trial.Â   \r\nHowever,\r\n  as the parties note in their briefs, the circuit court made some errors in the\r\n  original order, including ordering the parole board to only consider the murder\r\n  conviction when determining parole eligibility and finding there was no\r\n  retroactive application of the statute defining trafficking as a violent\r\n  offense.Â  See Sullivan v. State, 331 S.C. 479, 479, 504 S.E.2d\r\n  110, 111 (1998) (holding it is not a violation of the ex post facto clause for\r\n  the Legislature to enhance punishment for an offense based on a prior\r\n  conviction of the defendant, even though the enhancement provision was not in\r\n  effect at the time of the previous offense); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 21-24-640 (2007)\r\n  (noting that the parole board has the sole authority to determine parole\r\n  eligibility based on the prisonerâ€™s complete record).Â  Although we affirm the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s decision to enforce the plea agreement by resentencing Dingle,\r\n  we modify the courtâ€™s order to the extent it made findings inconsistent with\r\n  the above-cited law.Â   \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED. \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  Although trafficking was not defined as a violent crime at the time Dingle\r\n  originally entered his Lee County plea, trafficking was defined as a â€œviolent\r\n  crimeâ€ at the time of his Sumter County guilty plea.Â  Therefore, the prior Lee County plea would have rendered Dingle ineligible for parole consideration had it not been\r\n  vacated and the plea re-entered at the same time as his Sumter County plea.Â  See S.C.

Â§ 29-3-660 (2007).\r\nAlthough the\r\n  Master-in-Equity interpreted this statutory section as giving an equity court\r\n  the discretion to determine whether to grant a deficiency judgment, we find\r\n  this interpretation clearly conflicts with South Carolina case law on this\r\n  issue.\r\nWe\r\n  have explained that a mortgage â€œrepresents security for an obligation, [but] not\r\n  full payment thereof.â€ Â Perpetual Bldg. and Loan Assâ€™n of Anderson v. Braun,\r\n  270 S.C. 338, 340, 242 S.E.2d 407, 408&nbsp;(1978).Â  Thus, the general rule is\r\n  that â€œif the mortgaged premises are sold under a foreclosure decree and fail to\r\n  bring a sufficient amount to satisfy the debt, the mortgagee is entitled,\r\n  absent any statutory limitation or waiver on his part, to a personal judgment\r\n  for the remaining deficiency.â€ Â Id. (citation omitted). Â Moreover, â€œa\r\n  mortgagee is not denied the full amount due him merely because he elects\r\n  initially to pursue his remedy by foreclosure. Â An action for a deficiency\r\n  judgment as a sequel to foreclosure is taken as a matter of course.â€Â  Id. at 341, 242 S.E.2d at 408.\r\nLooking\r\n  at the applicable South Carolina foreclosure statutes, the Braun Court\r\n  found the Legislature intended for a deficiency judgment to be denied only when it has been â€œexpressly waived.â€Â  Id. at 343, 242 S.E.2d at 409; see\r\n    also Bartles v. Livingston, 282 S.C. 448, 319 S.E.2d 707 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n  (â€œa mortgagee whose debt remains unsatisfied after sale of the property is\r\n  entitled to a deficiency judgment, unless the right to a deficiency has been\r\n  waived.â€). Â Consequently, the Court in Braun held that although a\r\n  deficiency judgment had not been specifically demanded in the foreclosure\r\n  complaint, the equity court properly granted the mortgagee the deficiency\r\n  judgment.Â   \r\nIn Bartles\r\n  v. Livingston, supra, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s denial of a deficiency judgment for the mortgagee.Â  The Bartles court stated the following:\r\n\r\n\tAbsent\r\n  grounds to set aside the decree of foreclosure, there is no discretion to cut off the right to a deficiency after sale where (1) the complaint in the\r\n  foreclosure action asks for personal judgment, (2) the amount of the debt is\r\n  fixed in the foreclosure decree, and (3) the sale is insufficient to satisfy\r\n  the entire debt.\r\n\r\n282 S.C. at 461, 319 S.E.2d\r\n  at 715 (emphasis added).\r\nWe find the\r\n  Master-in-Equity erred in the instant case by denying appellant the requested\r\n  deficiency judgment.Â  Appellant had not waived its right to a deficiency\r\n  judgment, but instead specifically demanded a deficiency.Â  Certainly, appellant\r\n  met the criteria set out in Bartles, and therefore, the Master-in-Equity\r\n  was bound to award the deficiency judgment in the amount of $39,087.99.[2]\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we reverse the denial of the deficiency judgment and remand to the\r\n  Master-in-Equity for an order consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. BEATTY, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] Although respondent defaulted on the complaint, she\r\n  appeared at the November 17, 2005, foreclosure hearing.Â  At this hearing, she\r\n  did not contest that the total debt amount was $61,763.90.\r\n[2] We note the foreclosure statutes regarding appraisal give\r\n  the defendant in a foreclosure action - the mortgagor - a right to apply for an\r\n  order of appraisal which could possibly result in the deficiency judgment being\r\n  adjusted or extinguished.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 29-3-680 &amp; -740\r\n  (2007).Â  Furthermore, there are guidelines for an equity court to set aside a\r\n  foreclosure sale.Â  Although inadequacy of price generally is not enough to\r\n  allow the court to set aside a sale, if the sale price â€œâ€˜is so gross as to\r\n  shock the conscience,â€™â€ the court may interfere with the sale.Â  Investors\r\n    Sav. Bank v. Phelps,&nbsp;303 S.C. 15, 17, 397 S.E.2d 780, 781&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1990) (quoting Â Poole v. Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co.,\r\n  174 S.C. 150, 157, 177 S.E. 24, 27 (1934)).Â  In Investors Sav. Bank v.\r\n    Phelps,&nbsp;the Court of Appeals affirmed the Masterâ€™s decision to set\r\n  aside the sale where the bid amount was only slightly more than 1% of the\r\n  original amount of the mortgage.Â  Here, however, appellantâ€™s bid was\r\n  approximately 47% of the original amount of the mortgage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
