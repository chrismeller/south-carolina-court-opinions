(â€œEldecoâ€) and Respondents Charleston County School District (â€œCCSDâ€) and Skanska USA Building, Inc. (â€œSkanskaâ€)[1].Â  Eldeco alleged that Skanska breached the partiesâ€™ contract by failing to award certain electrical work in a new school building to Eldeco.Â  Eldeco also alleged that CCSD intentionally interfered in the contractual relationship between Eldeco and Skanska.Â  The trial court found in favor of Skanska and CCSD.Â  Eldeco appeals and we affirm.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nCCSD began construction of a new high school building (â€œthe Projectâ€) in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina in 2002.Â  Skanska was the general contractor for the Project and hired Eldeco as an electrical subcontractor.Â  At the time the parties entered into their respective contracts, the Project called for the construction of the school building as specified in the contract documents, which included an unfinished area for vocational training.Â  \r\nAfter construction of the Project began, CCSD decided to complete the vocational training area (â€œCulinary Arts Upfitâ€) and add additional classroom space on either side of the school building (â€œClassroom Additionsâ€).Â Â  CCSD asked Skanska to provide a pricing estimate for the Culinary Arts Upfit and the Classroom Additions.Â  As part of the pricing estimate, Skanska asked Eldeco to provide an estimate for the electrical work required for the Culinary Arts Upfit and the Classroom Additions.Â  Eldeco submitted an estimate of $442,000.00.Â  \r\nFollowing the school boardâ€™s approval for the additional work, CCSD formally requested pricing from Skanska.Â  Skanska submitted its formal pricing quote which included Eldecoâ€™s official price for the Classroom Additions electrical work in the amount of $881,855.94.Â  CCSD objected to the adjusted price, and Eldeco eventually lowered the price to $720,000.00.Â  Eldeco also submitted a pricing quote for the Culinary Arts Upfit electrical work of $248,311.76.Â  At the request of CCSD, Skanska obtained pricing from another electrical contractor.Â  Mt. Pleasant Mechanical submitted a price for the Classroom Additions in the amount of $348,812.00 and for the Culinary Arts Upfit in the amount of $229,340.00.Â  Upon instructions from CCSD, Skanska subcontracted with Mt. Pleasant Mechanical to perform the additional electrical work.Â  \r\nEldeco filed suit against Mt. Pleasant Mechanical,[2] Skanska, and CCSD.Â  Eldeco sought recovery against Skanska for breach of contract on the basis of Skanskaâ€™s failure to award Eldeco the electrical work in the Classroom Additions and the Culinary Arts Upfit.[3]Â  Eldeco sought recovery against CCSD for tortious interference with contractual relations and intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.Â  As grounds for these claims, Eldeco alleged that CCSD interfered with Eldecoâ€™s contract with Skanska by instructing Skanska to hire Mt. Pleasant Mechanical, Inc. for the additional electrical work.Â  \r\nA jury trial began in April 2005.Â  At the conclusion of Eldecoâ€™s case, the trial judge directed a verdict in favor of CCSD.Â  At the conclusion of all evidence, the trial judge denied Skanskaâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â  At that point, the parties agreed to dismiss the jury and allow the trial court to determine whether the term â€œWorkâ€ as defined in the contract documents included the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit.Â  According to their agreement, if the trial judge determined that the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit were within the definition of â€œWork,â€ the trial court would award damages to Eldeco in the amount of $120,270.00.Â  However, if the additional work fell outside of the definition, no damages would be awarded. \r\nThe trial court ultimately concluded that the definition of â€œWorkâ€ did not include the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit.Â  Accordingly, no damages were awarded.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Eldeco appealed, and this Court certified the case from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Eldeco raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n      Did the trial court err in finding the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit were not included in the definition of â€œWorkâ€ as provided in the contract documents?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the trial court err in directing a verdict in favor of CCSD as to Eldecoâ€™s tort causes of action?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.Â  Eldecoâ€™s Claim Against Skanska\r\nEldeco argues the trial court erred in finding the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit were not included in the definition of â€œWorkâ€ as provided in the contract documents.Â  We disagree.\r\nA cause of action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.Â \r\nSouth Carolina Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., Inc., 310 S.C. 232, 235, 423 S.E.2d 114, 116 (1992).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assoc. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\nThe contract between CCSD and Skanska provided:\r\n\r\n1.1.3 THE WORK\r\nThe term â€œWorkâ€ means the construction and services required by the Contract Documents, whether completed or partially completed, and includes all other labor, materials, equipment and services provided or to be provided by the Contractor to fulfill the Contractorâ€™s obligations.Â  The Work may constitute the whole or a part of the Project. \r\n1.1.4 THE PROJECT\r\nThe Project is the total construction of which the Work performed under the Contract Documents may be the whole or a part and which may include construction by other Contractors and by the Ownerâ€™s own forces including persons or entities under separate contracts not administered by the Construction Manager. \r\n6.1.1 OWNERâ€™S RIGHT TO PERFORM CONSTRUCTION WITH OWN FORCES AND TO AWARD OTHER CONTRACTS\r\nThe Owner reserves the right to perform construction or operations related to the Project with the Ownerâ€™s own forces, which include persons or entities under separate contracts not administered by the Construction Manager.Â  The Owner further reserves the right to award other contracts in connection with other portions of the Project or other construction or operations on the site under Conditions of the Contract identical or substantially similar. . . . \r\n\r\nThe subcontract between Skanska and Eldeco provided:\r\n\r\nArticle 1:Â  Subcontractor, as an independent contractor employed by Contractor, agrees to provide and to furnish all labor, materials, scaffolding, equipment, systems, machinery, tools, apparatus, transportation, shop drawings, samples and submittals necessary to provide, furnish and complete the following Work, all to be performed in connection with the above-described Project, and in accordance with the following: \r\nArticle 2:Â  The Contract Documents for this Subcontract consist of this Agreement and any exhibits or attachments hereto, the Agreement between the Owner and Contractor for the above referenced Project, all conditions to the Agreement between the Owner and Contractor (General, Supplementary and any other Coditions), all Drawings, Specifications, and Contract Documents referenced in that Agreement, along with Addenda and modifications to that Agreement.Â  \r\nWith respect to its Work, Subcontractor agrees to be bound to the Contractor by all of the terms of the agreement between the Contractor and the Owner (except for the payment provisions) and the Contract documents thereto, and assumes toward the Contractor and the Owner all the obligations and responsibilities that the Contractor by those instruments assumes toward the Owner.Â  \r\n\r\nIn its order, the trial court found that the Classroom Additions and the Culinary Arts Upfit were not included in the definition of the â€œWorkâ€ as provided in Article 1 of Skanksaâ€™s subcontract with Eldeco or the definition of the â€œWorkâ€ as described in Paragraph 1.1.3 of Skanksaâ€™s contract with CCSD because the additional work was outside the scope of the contract documents.Â  \r\nEldeco argues that the trial courtâ€™s finding was unreasonable because the definition of â€œWorkâ€ included changes to the work pursuant to a â€œChange Orderâ€ or a â€œConstruction Change Directive.â€[4]Â  According to Eldeco, the Classroom Additions and the Culinary Arts Upfit were merely changes in the Work that should have occurred under a Change Order or Construction Change Directive.Â  In support of this contention, Eldeco focuses on the fact that it had performed some 109 Change Orders during the course of construction of the Project, and that the process used for the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit was identical to the process used for the other Change Orders.Â  Additionally, Eldeco contends that it was entitled to do all electrical work on the Project which was initiated through a Change Order or Construction Change Directive and administered by the Construction Manager.Â  \r\nContrarily, Skanska contends that the trial courtâ€™s decision was reasonable in light of the evidence presented at trial.Â  First, Skanska contended that the contract documents delineated only the work that Skanska was required to complete and, in fact, did not provide a right or obligation for Skanska to perform work like the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit which exceeded the scope of Skanskaâ€™s original contract as general contractor.Â  Second, Skanska argued that Paragraph 6.1.1 of their contract with CCSD specifically reserved the right of CCSD to use other contractors for the completion of the Project.Â  Finally, Skanska presented several witnesses who testified that the additional work was outside the scope of the contract.Â  \r\nWe find that the record contains sufficient evidence upon which the trial court could have found that the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit were not included in the definition of â€œWork.â€Â  Article 1 of the subcontract between Skanska and Eldeco clearly defines the scope of Work according to the listed specifications, which do not include the Classroom Additions or the Culinary Arts Upfit as modified.Â  Bolstering the testimony of its witnesses, Skanska introduced Exhibits 22-24 which indicated that Skanska and CCSD utilized supplementary contracts, and not Change Orders, for the additional work.Â  Moreover, because the general contract between Skanska and CCSD provided that any agreement between the contractor and subcontractor was subject to the provisions of the general contract, Eldecoâ€™s subcontract with Skanska could not have expanded Eldecoâ€™s rights as to the Work on the Project. Â As Skanska demonstrated, this additional work was outside the scope of the general contract between Skanska and\r\nCCSD.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in finding the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit were outside the scope of the definition of â€œWorkâ€ as provided in the contract documents.\r\nII. Eldecoâ€™s Claims Against CCSD \r\nEldeco argues the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of CCSD as to Eldecoâ€™s causes of action for tortious interference with contractual relations and intentional interference with prospective contractual relations because CCSD was entitled immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (â€œTort Claims Actâ€).Â  We agree that the trial court erroneously applied the Tort Claims Act. Â However, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling because Eldecoâ€™s claims fail as a matter of law.Â Â Â Â  \r\nA.Â  Immunity Based on an â€œIntent to Harmâ€\r\nEldeco contends that the trial court erred by finding that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(17) (2005) provided immunity to CCSD for the claims of tortious interference with contractual relations and intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.Â  We agree.\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions. Â Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).Â  This Court will reverse only where there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling or where the ruling was controlled by an error of law. Â Â Id.Â  \r\nTo establish a cause of action for tortious interference with contractual relations, a plaintiff must show:Â  1) the existence of a contract; 2) knowledge of the contract; 3) intentional procurement of its breach; 4) the absence of justification; and 5) resulting damages.Â  Kinard v. Crosby, 315 S.C. 237, 240, 433 S.E.2d 835, 837 (1993).Â  To establish a cause of action for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations, a plaintiff must show: 1) intentional interference with prospective contractual relations; 2) for an improper purpose or by improper methods; and 3) resulting in injury.Â  Crandall Corp. v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp., 302 S.C. 265, 266, 395 S.E.2d 179, 180 (1990).\r\nThe Tort Claims Act provides that â€œthe State, an agency, a political subdivision, and a governmental entity are liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations upon liability and damages, and exemptions from liability and damages contained herein.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-78-40 (2005).Â  The provision containing the exceptions to the waiver of immunity provides in relevant part, â€œ[a] governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from . . . employee conduct outside the scope of his official duties or which\r\nconstitutes actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-78-60 (17).\r\nDuring the discussion of CCSDâ€™s directed verdict motion, the trial court found that â€œintentional procurementâ€ and â€œintentional interferenceâ€ necessarily involves an â€œintent to harm.â€ Â Eldeco asserted that it did not have to prove an â€œintent to harmâ€ to succeed on the merits of its claims against CCSD.Â  At the conclusion of arguments on the motion, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of CCSD, primarily based on Â§15-78-60 (17).Â Â  \r\nWe hold that this was error.Â  None of the elements required for either cause of action, as clearly shown above, include â€œintent to harm.â€Â  Although it is true that harm may result from an intentional interference with existing or prospective contractual relations, it is not necessary that the interfering party intend such harm.Â Â  Instead, it is only necessary that they intend to interfere with either an existing contract or intend to interfere with a prospective contract.[5]\r\nAccordingly, the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of CCSD based on the â€œintent to harmâ€ exception to the waiver of immunity provided in the Tort Claims Act.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Merits of Eldecoâ€™s Claims Against CCSD \r\nCCSD argues as an additional sustaining ground that Eldecoâ€™s claims against CCSD fail as a matter of law.Â  CCSD argues that the claims against CCSD are inextricably tied to the disposition of Eldecoâ€™s claim against Skanska.Â  We agree.\r\nAn essential element to the cause of action for tortious interference with contractual relations requires the intentional procurement of the contractâ€™s breach.Â  Kinard, 315 S.C. at 240, 433 S.E.2d at 837. Â Where there is no breach of the contract, there can be no recovery.Â  First Union Mortg. Corp. v. Thomas, 317 S.C. 63, 73, 451 S.E.2d 907, 913 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Furthermore, an essential element to the cause of action for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations requires that the interference be for an improper purpose or by improper methods.Â  â€œGenerally, there can be no finding of intentional interference with prospective contractual relations if there is no evidence to suggest any purpose or motive by the defendant other than the proper pursuit of its own contractual rights with a third party.â€ Southern Contracting, Inc. v. H.C. Brown Constr. Co., 317 S.C. 95, 102, 450 S.E.2d 602, 606 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nBecause we affirm the trial courtâ€™s finding that the contract documents did not include the Classroom Additions and Culinary Arts Upfit in the definition of Work, we find that Skanska did not breach its contract with Eldeco. Â Eldeco did not have any contractual rights to perform the additional work on the Project.Â  In the absence of a breach of a contract, Eldeco cannot prove the required elements of its cause of action for tortious interference with contractual relations.Â  Additionally, we find that the contract between Skanska and CCSD preserved CCSDâ€™s right to conduct other Work on the Project with its own or other forces.Â  Therefore, CCSD acted in pursuit of its own contractual rights, and Eldeco cannot prevail on its claim against CCSD for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling in favor of CCSD based on the failure of Eldecoâ€™s claims as a matter of law.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\n\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Skanska USA Building, Inc. was formerly known as Beers Skanska, Inc.\r\n[2] Mt. Pleasant Mechanical, Inc. is not involved in this appeal. The company filed for bankruptcy protection and thus, the pending action was stayed.Â  \r\n[3] Eldeco also sought recovery against Skanska for violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  However, the trial court granted Skanskaâ€™s motion for Summary Judgment, and that ruling is not implicated in this appeal.\r\n[4] Â Both a Change Order and a Construction Change Directive are defined in Article 7 of the contract between Skanska and CCSD.Â  Essentially, a Change Order is a written instrument which authorizes changes in the Work and is used when all parties are in agreement as to the terms of the changes in the Work.Â  A Construction Change Directive is a written instrument similar to a Change Order, however, this document is used in the absence of total agreement on the terms of the Change Order.Â  \r\n[5] The concept of â€œintent to harmâ€ is analogous to the concept of â€œmalicious intent,â€ which courts have previously interjected into the analyses of claims for intentional interference with contractual relations and intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.Â  However, consideration of these concepts in this context is often an error, due in large part to the historical use of the term â€œmaliciousâ€ to describe the idea that the intent must generally be improper in some way.Â  Therefore, as modern courts have addressed these causes of action, the distorted notion of â€œmalicious intentâ€ has been removed, and the elements of these torts have been clarified as specifically requiring the intent to interfere for an improper purpose rather than a motive generally grounded in some sort of spite or ill-will towards the plaintiff.

Dobbs, The Law of Torts Â§ 446 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2006); and Prosser and Keeton, The Law of Torts Â§Â§ 129-130 (5th ed. 1984). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26281","title":"State v.

Lloyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26281\r\nHeard January 30, 2007 - Filed March 5, 2007Â \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAppellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Christopher Thomas (appellant) pled guilty to distribution of crack cocaine within a prohibited proximity of a school.Â  Appellant was sentenced to the minimum term of ten years as provided by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (2002).Â  He now seeks a new sentencing hearing, claiming the circuit court judge erroneously declared that he had no power to suspend appellantâ€™s sentence because a minimum sentence was provided by statute.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was indicted for distribution of crack cocaine and distribution within one-half mile of a school.Â  The State dropped the distribution charge, and appellant pled guilty to the proximity charge.Â  After appellant was advised of his rights and the court accepted the guilty plea, appellant was sentenced to a ten year prison term, the minimum provided by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445(B)(2).\r\nSix days later, after timely notice, appellant appeared before the court seeking reconsideration of his sentence.Â  Family members testified on appellantâ€™s behalf, and appellant asked the court to consider suspending the sentence.Â  The judge refused, stating that because a minimum and maximum sentencing range was prescribed by Â§ 44-53-445(B)(2), he was powerless to suspend any portion of the minimum sentence.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court abuse its discretion by refusing to reconsider appellantâ€™s sentence on the grounds that it had no authority to suspend a minimum sentence?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe general power to suspend sentences derives from S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 (1989).[1]Â  This power does not extend to offenses where the legislature has specifically mandated that no part of a sentence may be suspended.Â  State v. Johnson, 343 S.C. 693, 541 S.E.2d 855 (Ct. App. 2001); State v. Taub, 336 S.C. 310, 519 S.E.2d 797 (Ct. App. 1999); and State v. Tisdale, 321 S.C. 153, 467 S.E.2d 270 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nThe criminal statute violated in this case, Â§ 44-53-445, requires the person found guilty â€œmust be fined not less than ten thousand dollars and imprisoned not less than ten nor more than fifteen years.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445(B)(2).Â  However, unlike the statutes analyzed in Johnson, Taub, and Tisdale, Â§ 44-53-445 contains no provision prohibiting the suspension of a sentence imposed pursuant to the statute.\r\nAppellant argues that because Â§ 44-53-445 does not specifically prohibit suspension of a sentence for distribution within proximity of a school, the circuit judge had the authority under Â§ 24-21-410 to suspend the minimum sentence.Â  We agree.\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.Â  Howell v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 505, 636 S.E.2d 626 (2006).Â  However, statutes must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of the same general statutory scheme must be construed together and each one given effect, if reasonable.Â  Higgins v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 415 S.E.2d 799 (1992).Â  Penal statutes are to be construed strictly against the State and in favor of the defendant.Â  State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 559 S.E.2d 847 (2002).\r\nIn numerous penal statutes, the legislature has included specific provisions to prohibit suspension, in whole or in part, of sentences to fines or imprisonment.[2]Â  Here, the omission of any such provision in the proximity statute, Â§ 44-53-445, indicates the legislature did not intend to limit the general authority to suspend sentences.Â  \r\nThe State contends that because the proximity statute is part of the same statutory scheme as Â§Â§ 44-53-370, -375, and -440,[3] the legislature also intended to preclude suspension of sentences imposed pursuant to Â§ 44-53-445.Â  We disagree.Â  The legislature expressly included these limiting provisions in similar drug offense statutes and chose not to limit the authority to suspend sentences in Â§ 44-53-445.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000) (discussing the canon â€œexpressio unius est exclusio alterius,â€ or â€œto express or include one thing implies the exclusion of another,â€ and holding that the enumeration of exclusions from the operation of a statute indicates that the statute should apply to all cases not specifically excluded).\r\nFinally, the State argues that Â§ 44-53-445 is a specific statute that prevails over Â§ 24-21-410, a general statute.Â  See Taub, supra, and Johnson, supra.Â  While we agree that Â§ 44-53-445 provides the sentencing parameters for distribution of crack cocaine within proximity of a school, the statute does not contain any provision regarding suspension of a sentence.Â  Thus, this case is distinguishable from Taub, Johnson, and Tisdale because no prohibition against suspending sentences imposed pursuant to Â§ 44-53-445 conflicts with the general authority provided by Â§ 24-21-410.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s erroneous ruling that it had no authority to suspend the sentence provided by Â§ 44-53-445(B)(2) mandates vacation of the sentence imposed.Â  We therefore reverse and remand for\r\nresentencing.\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œAfter conviction or plea for any offense, except a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment, the judge of a court of record with criminal jurisdiction at the time of sentence may suspend the imposition or the execution of a sentence and place the defendant on probation or may impose a fine and also place the defendant on probation.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nWilliam N. Nettles, of Sanders &amp; Nettles, of Columbia, and Christopher Seeds, of New York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the grant of post-conviction relief (PCR) to respondent, Joseph Lee Ard, who was sentenced to death for killing his pregnant girlfriend, Madalyn Coffey, and their unborn son.Â  We affirm the PCR courtâ€™s grant of a new trial based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 23, 1993, at approximately 5:30 a.m., Coffey died from a single gunshot wound to her forehead. Â She was 17 years old and 35 weeks pregnant at the time; the viable fetus died from a lack of oxygen. Â There were no eyewitnesses to the shooting. Â Respondent was tried for two counts of murder.\r\nDuring the guilt phase of trial, the State presented over 20 witnesses.Â  Witnesses for the State testified they heard respondent threaten to kill Coffey and that he told Coffey he wished she and the baby were dead. Â Respondentâ€™s friend, Jay Johns, testified that he was with respondent and Coffey in the trailer just before the shooting, but had gone outside â€œto get a beerâ€ when he heard â€œa pop.â€Â  Johns went back inside the trailer; when Johns asked respondent what happened, he said â€œI think I killed her.â€Â  Johns called 911, and respondent fled the scene.[1]Â  \r\nSLED agent Joseph Powell testified for the State as an expert in gunshot residue analysis.Â  Two types of samples, alcohol swabs and scanning electron microscope (SEMS) tabs, had been taken from Coffeyâ€™s hands.Â  Powell stated that he first â€œran the swabs â€¦ to see if we could find any amount, any elevated elements of materials.Â  The elements we are looking for are materials call[ed] barium, antimony and lead.â€Â  Powell explained that these are the three elements which are found in gun primer residue.Â  Powell testified that after the initial test on the swabs was complete, â€œ[t]he values were not sufficient for a positive cause that there was gunshot residue, but there was an indication.â€Â  (Emphasis added). \r\nTherefore, Powell ran the SEMS test to see if there were â€œany actual physical particles that would have been found from gunshot residue.â€Â  Powell stated that there were â€œseveral particles which were very interesting, but there was not any or enough material for us to be able to call gunshot residue; thus, [Coffey] ha[d] no gunshot residue on her hands.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  The following colloquy then occurred:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       When you say no gunshot residue on her hands, can you rule out her having pulled the trigger on that gun?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       There is no gunshot residue on her hands.Â  If she had fired the weapon, the material that would have come from this gun would have had to have been removed before the test would have been administered.Â \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTrial counsel did not cross-examine Powell.[2]\r\nFormer SLED Agent Michael Avery also testified regarding gunshot residue. Avery stated that he was Powellâ€™s supervisor when the samples in\r\nthis case were tested.[3]Â Â  Avery stated he reviewed Powellâ€™s examination and confirmed Powellâ€™s conclusions.Â  In addition, the State elicited the following testimony: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       As a matter of fact, the defense has since hired you to review that?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, sir.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Again.Â  And you still confirm Joe Powellâ€™s conclusions?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, sir, the conclusion of the test results, which was no gunshot residue.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe defense at the guilt phase put up over 10 witnesses.Â  Several defense witnesses testified that respondent was excited about becoming a father and respondent and Coffey acted like they loved each other.[4]Â  There was also testimony respondent did not threaten or abuse Coffey and that he was planning on getting a ring for, and marrying, Coffey.Â  \r\nRespondent took the stand in his own defense and testified Coffeyâ€™s killing was an accident. Â He explained that he and Coffey were in a motel bathroom while Johns and his girlfriend were fighting in the motel room.Â  Coffey was upset and crying because respondent had been spending time in Atlanta with another woman.Â  When Johns and respondent went to leave the motel room, Coffey asked if she could go with respondent; he agreed.Â  Johns, respondent, and Coffey then left the motel room and drove to Johnsâ€™ trailer.Â  Respondent testified that Coffey sat on the couch while he kneeled on the floor.Â  When respondent told Coffey he was going to Atlanta the next day and she could not go with him, respondent stated that Coffey â€œgot real upset.â€Â  Respondent testified that Coffey had his gun in her hand and told him she did not love him.Â  When respondent denied he was going to Atlanta to be with the other woman named Maurer, Coffey said â€œYouâ€™re lying.Â  You just want to go down there and screw Maurer some more.Â  You donâ€™t love me or the baby.Â  We might as well be dead.â€Â  Respondent testified that she then pulled the hammer back on the pistol, cocking the gun.[5]Â  According to respondent, he tried to lean forward to grab the gun, Coffey â€œturned real quickâ€ and when he grabbed the cylinder gap of the gun, â€œit went off.â€Â  \r\nCoffey fell over.Â  Respondent tried to pick her up, got â€œstuff and bloodâ€ on his hands, â€œfreaked outâ€ and fled to Atlanta. Â Â After three days of taking pills, sleeping, and crying,[6] respondent returned to Columbia with the gun, and his parents took him to an attorney. Â As they were making arrangements in the attorneyâ€™s office to turn respondent in to the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department, he â€œblacked outâ€ and woke up in the hospital.\r\nIn the Stateâ€™s closing argument, the State argued that respondent killed his victims with malice.Â  Specifically, the State argued to the jury that the gunshot residue tests were important, and because there was no residue on Coffeyâ€™s hands, respondentâ€™s accident defense did not hold up:Â  \r\n\r\nâ€¦Why are these so important?Â  Because if there is no gunshot residue on her hands, as Joe Powell told you, then her hand wasnâ€™t on that gun when it went off.Â  Her hand wasnâ€™t near that gun when it went off.Â  Her hands were somewhere aside from on this gun.\r\nThatâ€™s why they are so important.Â  They canâ€™t attack Joe Powell.Â  They canâ€™t attack him because their own expert, Mike Avery, was hired by the defense to review Mr. Powellâ€™s work. \r\n[Objections by defense, which were overruled.] \r\nâ€¦He found no fault with Joe Powellâ€™s findings, that those findings were correct.\r\nNow, if the findings are correct, if the findings from these are correct, then the only thing they can do is attack the way itâ€™s collected.Â  If they canâ€™t attack the results, they have got to attack the way itâ€™s collected.[7]\r\nâ€¦\r\nWhy is it so important that these tests be discounted?Â  Because if they canâ€™t discount Joe Powell, if they canâ€™t discount those tests, then they canâ€™t get past the fact that there is no residue and then everything else they have raised is absolutely irrelevant, everything.â€¦Â  They have got to - got to - discount the value of those tests.\r\nâ€¦No gunshot residue.Â  None.Â  What does that tell yâ€™all?Â  What does that tell yâ€™all?\r\n\r\nIn addition to murder, the trial court charged the jury on involuntary manslaughter and accident.Â  After one hour of jury deliberations, the jury requested a â€œdefinition ofâ€ involuntary manslaughter and murder; the trial court recharged the jury on those two offenses.Â  After another 45 minutes of deliberation, the jury found respondent guilty of the murder of Coffey and the unborn child.Â  After a lengthy sentencing phase with numerous witnesses for both sides, the jury returned a recommendation of death.\r\nRespondent appealed, raising four issues related only to the sentencing phase.Â  This Court affirmed the death sentence.[8]Â  State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998) (Moore, J., concurring in separate opinion in result only; Gregory, A.J., concurring in majority opinion in result only).\r\nRespondent filed for PCR.Â  The PCR court found that trial counsel had failed to adequately investigate and challenge the Stateâ€™s gunshot residue evidence and therefore granted respondent a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel.[9]Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err in finding ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counselâ€™s failure to adequately investigate and challenge the Stateâ€™s gunshot residue evidence? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State argues the PCR court erred in finding ineffective assistance of trial counsel.Â  Specifically, the State argues trial counsel were not deficient because they reasonably investigated the gunshot residue evidence by hiring former SLED agent Avery as a gunshot residue expert and reasonably relying on Averyâ€™s advice.Â  The State further argues that even assuming deficiency, there is no prejudice.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe find the PCR courtâ€™s factual findings regarding deficiency and prejudice are well supported by the evidence presented at the PCR hearing.Â  A review of the relevant evidence is in order.Â  \r\nAfter filing for PCR, respondent deposed Powell, the SLED gunshot residue expert, in October 2001; Powell testified for the State at the PCR hearing in April 2004.Â  At both the deposition and the hearing, Powell stated that his testimony at trial was based on the SLED protocol in use at that time.Â  Based on this protocol, he accurately reported a finding of negative for gunshot residue.Â  Powell explained that SLEDâ€™s standard at the time was to report a positive conclusion of gunshot residue only if perfectly round gunshot residue particles were detected, which specifically meant spherical particles containing barium, antimony and lead.Â  However, he further explained that as time went on, there were concerns that when non-round particles with the three required elements were found, or perfectly round lead particles were found, these findings should not be reported as a negative finding, but rather as â€œinconclusive.â€Â  \r\nRegarding the instant case, he stated that if the analysis was conducted under the modern protocol, his conclusion would be that two particles on Coffeyâ€™s right back hand were inconclusive for gunshot residue.Â  Powell explained that an â€œinconclusiveâ€ finding meant it was not consistent with the person firing the gun, but could be consistent with the person handling the weapon.[10]  \r\nEven more significant, however, was Powellâ€™s testimony that had respondentâ€™s counsel cross-examined him at trial regarding his statement that â€œseveral particles â€¦ were very interesting,â€ he would have testified that although the evidence from Coffeyâ€™s hands did not meet SLEDâ€™s threshold for positively identifying it as gunshot residue, the evidence could have been associated with gunshot residue.[11]Â  Furthermore, Powell stated that if defense counsel had met with him prior to trial to discuss the test results, he would have explained what he found â€œinterestingâ€ about them.Â  In other words, if counsel had asked, either prior to trial or at trial, Powell would have explained that the evidence from Coffeyâ€™s hands, which revealed at least two particles with the three required elements, was consistent with gunshot residue and could have come from her handling a weapon.Â  \r\nTrial counsel Jack Duncan and Elizabeth Fullwood both testified at the PCR hearing. Â Both attorneys testified there was an extreme delay in receiving the requested discovery materials from the solicitorâ€™s office.[12]Â  These discovery materials included the gunshot residue test results analyzed by Powell and dated October 1993.Â  They did not receive the underlying â€œraw dataâ€ for the gunshot residue tests until March 1, 1996 after making a specific additional request for the data.Â  Duncan testified that receiving the â€œno gunshot residueâ€ finding in February 1996 created â€œa big hole in [the] theory of the caseâ€ which was accident.Â  Likewise, Fullwood testified that respondent had a â€œgood defenseâ€ to the guilt phase until the gunshot residue tests undermined the accident defense; Fullwood and Duncan both stated that they could not explain why Coffey did not have gunshot residue on her hands.Â  According to Duncan, the prosecution â€œexploitedâ€ this â€œholeâ€ to argue in closing that respondentâ€™s version of events could not have happened.Â  \r\nAs to retaining Avery, Powellâ€™s former SLED supervisor, as a defense expert, Fullwood testified Avery was hired â€œ[t]o see if he could help us understand and explain the results of the gunshot residue tests SLED had conducted.â€[13]Â  Duncan testified that after Avery told them there was nothing â€œuseful,â€ i.e., â€œnothing for [counsel] to question,â€ in the gunshot residue tests, they tried to develop theories as to why Coffey did not have gunshot residue on her hands, such as the way this evidence was collected and preserved.Â  Counsel did not request that Avery independently re-test the gunshot residue evidence.Â  \r\nDuncan further testified that counsel did not cross-examine the Stateâ€™s witnesses related to the gunshot residue test results because they â€œdidnâ€™t want to draw any more attention to itâ€ since they â€œhad no response to what they had to say.â€Â  When Duncan was asked about Powellâ€™s deposition testimony which showed Powell would have testified in a manner favorable to the defense if counsel had asked him certain questions, Duncan acknowledged that â€œthe answers would have helped [the defense] immensely.â€\r\nFinally, respondent presented his own gunshot residue expert at the PCR hearing, Robert White.Â  In contrast to Powell, White positively identified several particles of gunshot residue from Coffeyâ€™s tests.Â  In Whiteâ€™s opinion, as long as a particle contains the three required elements (barium, antimony, and lead) and is round-ish in shape (as opposed to crystalline, or spiky), then the particle constitutes unique gunshot residue.Â  In addition, White found several particles â€œcharacteristic of gunshot residue,â€ which he defined as â€œother particles of lead, barium and antimony in combinations of two or alone.â€Â  White testified a person could get unique and characteristic particles from picking up a gun, firing a gun, or being close to a gun going off.Â  Â Â \r\nThe PCR court ruled that trial counselâ€™s failure to adequately evaluate and challenge the Stateâ€™s gunshot residue testimony was deficient performance that resulted in prejudice to respondent.Â Â  As to deficiency, the PCR court concluded trial counsel failed to: (1) â€œaggressively re-examineâ€ the gunshot residue reports; (2) â€œread the documents, evaluate them, and pursue the necessary next steps, such as consulting an appropriate,â€ i.e., â€œan independent expert;â€ and (3) â€œinvestigate the possibility of retesting the samples.â€Â  As to prejudice, the PCR court found that the â€œextent to which the jurors credited Powellâ€™s testimony â€¦ was critical to the outcome of the case.â€Â  Moreover, the PCR court noted that â€œ[d]efense counselâ€™s failure to refute gunshot residue evidence transformed an arguable case into a clear caseâ€¦.Â  Because of the solicitorâ€™s critical reliance on the absence of gunshot residue evidence, there is little question that the tenor of the jury deliberations would have been different, but for counselâ€™s mistakes.â€Â Â  Finally, the PCR court stated it was not â€œconfident that a jury, adequately informed, would have convicted [respondent] of murder.â€\r\nThe State first argues the PCR court erred because respondent has not proved trial counsel was deficient.Â  The State contends that counsel reviewed SLEDâ€™s gunshot residue report and consulted with an expert.Â  According to the State, because the expert reported he was satisfied with the report, counsel then reasonably focused their strategy on attacking the way the evidence was collected.Â  In addition, the State maintains there could be no prejudice.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the burden is on the applicant to prove the allegations in his application.Â  E.g., Bannister v. State, 333 S.C. 298, 509 S.E.2d 807 (1998).Â  This Court will uphold factual findings of the PCR court if there is any evidence of probative value to support them. Â Webb v. State, 281 S.C. 237, 314 S.E.2d 839 (1984).Â  The Court will reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision when it is controlled by an error of law. Â Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).\r\nThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions in the case. E.g., Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). Â In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the PCR applicant must show that:Â  (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have been different. Â Strickland v. Washington, supra; Rhodes v. State, 349 S.C. 25, 561 S.E.2d 606 (2002). Â A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial. Â Id.Â  Furthermore, when a defendantâ€™s conviction is challenged, â€œthe question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the fact finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.â€Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 695.\r\nWithout a doubt, â€œ[a] criminal defense attorney has a duty to investigate, but this duty is limited to reasonable investigation.â€ Â Thompson v. Wainwright, 787 F.2d 1447, 1450 (11th Cir. 1986); see also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 691.Â  When evaluating the reasonableness of counselâ€™s conduct, â€œthe court should keep in mind that counselâ€™s function, as elaborated in prevailing professional norms, is to make the adversarial testing process work in the particular case.â€Â  Strickland v. Washington,&nbsp;466 U.S. at 690. Â Moreover, while the scope of a reasonable investigation depends upon a number of issues, â€œat a minimum, counsel has the duty to interview potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case.â€Â  Troedel v. Wainwright,&nbsp;667 F.Supp. 1456, 1461&nbsp;(S.D.Fla. 1986), affâ€™d, 828 F.2d 670 (11th Cir. 1987) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) has specifically provided guidelines for defense counselâ€™s performance regarding investigation of a capital case:Â  â€œCounsel at every stage have an obligation to conduct thorough and independent investigations relating to the issues of both guilt and penalty.â€Â  American Bar Association Guidelines For The Appointment And Performance Of Defense Counsel In Death Penalty Cases, reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1015 (2003) (emphasis added) (hereinafter â€œABA Guidelinesâ€).[14]Â  With respect to forensic evidence, the ABA directs the following: Â â€œWith the assistance of appropriate experts, counsel should [] aggressively re-examine all of the governmentâ€™s forensic evidence, and conduct appropriate analyses of all other available forensic evidence.â€Â  Id. at 1020.\r\nIn our opinion, the PCR court correctly found ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  We find respondent proved that trial counsel should have further investigated and more thoroughly challenged the gunshot residue evidence.Â  Furthermore, the evidence at the PCR hearing establishes that if they had made an appropriate challenge, it would have had a significant impact on the guilt phase of this case. Â Â \r\nFirst, we note that the testimony from both trial counsel at the PCR hearing indicates how crucial the gunshot residue evidence was to respondentâ€™s defense.Â  They had not expected the results to come back negative, and those negative results considerably undermined respondentâ€™s account of the incident.Â  While counsel did seek out an expert, counsel nevertheless was deficient for retaining Avery, Powellâ€™s former SLED supervisor, as their expert.Â  Although Avery was no longer working for SLED in 1996 when he was retained as a defense expert, the PCR court correctly found that Avery was not an independent expert because he had reviewed the gunshot residue report in his role as Powellâ€™s supervisor.[15]Â  In order for Avery to question Powellâ€™s findings he would have implicitly had to have cast doubt on his own oversight of that very same analysis.Â  Although there is no evidence that Avery did, in fact, render a biased opinion to defense counsel, we agree with the PCR court that it was unreasonable for counsel to choose Avery as their only expert on the critical gunshot residue analysis.Â  See Strickland v. Washington,&nbsp;466 U.S. at 690 (â€œcounselâ€™s function â€¦ is to make the adversarial testing process work in the particular caseâ€); ABA Guidelines, supra (recommending independent investigation as well as an â€œaggressive re-examin[ation]â€ of all of the Stateâ€™s forensic evidence). Â \r\nFurthermore, we note that the State - during both Averyâ€™s testimony and its closing argument - emphasized for the jury the fact that Avery had been hired by the defense and nonetheless had confirmed Powellâ€™s conclusions.[16]Â  \r\nAdditionally, counsel did not discuss the gunshot residue analysis at all with Powell during their pretrial investigation.Â  Powell testified at PCR that he would have explained to defense counsel why he believed some of the particles were â€œinteresting;â€ this discussion would have given counsel an opportunity to prepare an effective cross-examination which would have resulted in Powell testifying that the evidence was not inconsistent with Coffey handling the gun.Â  In our opinion, counsel were unreasonable in not exploring the gunshot residue evidence with Powell prior to trial.Â  Troedel v. Wainwright,&nbsp;supra (counsel has the duty to interview potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case); see also ABA Guidelines, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 1019 (â€œcounsel should seek out and interview potential witnessesâ€).\r\nEven at trial, however, Powellâ€™s testimony clearly alluded to some uncertainty in the evidence.Â  Powell testified there were â€œseveral particles which were very interesting, but there was not any or enough material for us to be able to call gunshot residue; thus, [Coffey] ha[d] no gunshot residue on her hands.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Counsel should have cross-examined Powell as to what he meant by â€œvery interestingâ€ and not â€œenough material.â€Â  Had counsel asked these questions, Powell would have filled the â€œholeâ€ in the defense which they thought was created (but actually was not) by Powellâ€™s ultimate conclusion of â€œno gunshot residue.â€Â  Accordingly, we find that counselâ€™s decision to not cross-examine Powell on the gunshot residue evidence was not an objectively reasonable strategy.Â  See Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 474, 560 S.E.2d 401, 405 (2002) (counsel must articulate an objectively reasonable strategy to avoid a finding of ineffectiveness). \r\nMoreover, the Stateâ€™s heavy reliance in closing argument on the lack of gunshot residue further supports how critical it would have been if counsel had elicited testimony from Powell that the evidence indeed was consistent with Coffey handling a gun.Â  The Deputy Solicitor argued:Â  \r\n\r\nif there is no gunshot residue on her hands, as Joe Powell told you, then her hand wasnâ€™t on that gun when it went off.Â  Her hand wasnâ€™t near that gun when it went offâ€¦. if they canâ€™t discount Joe Powell, if they canâ€™t discount those tests, then they canâ€™t get past the fact that there is no residue and then everything else they have raised is absolutely irrelevant, everything.â€¦Â  They have got to - got to - discount the value of those tests.\r\n\r\nRespondent clearly showed that counsel could have established that while there was a scientific finding of â€œno gunshot residue,â€ there nevertheless was evidence consistent with (but not conclusive of) Coffey handling the gun.Â  Had counsel elicited this testimony from Powell, the State would not have been able to attack the defense theory as convincingly as it did.Â  \r\nThe Stateâ€™s heavy reliance on defense counselâ€™s failure to challenge this gunshot residue evidence highlights both the deficiency by counsel and the resulting prejudice.Â  We note that the jury apparently did not believe this to be an open-and-shut case of murder because after deliberating for an hour, the jury asked for further clarification from the trial court on the definitions of murder and involuntary manslaughter.Â  It is also worth noting that because the jury did have the option of involuntary manslaughter, it could have accepted respondentâ€™s account and yet still found him criminally responsible for the victimsâ€™ deaths.[17]\r\nFinally, we disagree with the dissentâ€™s suggestion that the PCR court found ineffective assistance of counsel based on respondentâ€™s introduction at the PCR proceedings of an expert who conclusively found gunshot residue.Â  The PCR courtâ€™s findings are based almost exclusively on Powellâ€™s testimony as to what information he would have provided to counsel if only they had asked - either prior to trial or on cross-examination.Â  Neither this Court, nor the PCR court, has handed respondent a â€œsecond chanceâ€ because he has, many years after conviction, found a favorable expert.Â  Instead, the PCR court properly focused on the evidence that counsel failed to appropriately examine the Stateâ€™s forensics evidence and failed to obtain the\r\nassistance of an appropriate expert.Â  Likewise, it is the evidence available at the time of trial which we, too, rely upon to uphold the PCR courtâ€™s grant of relief. \r\nIn sum, we hold counselâ€™s decisions regarding the investigation of, and failure to challenge, the gunshot residue evidence were unreasonable and clearly deficient, especially given the fact that this was a capital case with an arguable defense to the guilt phase. Â There is ample probative evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s factual findings of deficient performance compelling us to affirm.Â  Webb v. State, supra (if there is any evidence of probative value to support the PCR courtâ€™s factual findings, the Court will uphold the findings).Â  Moreover, the PCR court correctly found prejudice.Â  In our opinion, without counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability the jury would have had a reasonable doubt as to whether respondent was guilty of murder.Â  See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 695.\r\nAccordingly, the PCR courtâ€™s rulings that trial counsel was ineffective and respondent is entitled to a new trial are AFFIRMED. \r\nMOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would reverse the decision of the PCR court.Â  In my opinion, Ardâ€™s trial counsel adequately investigated the issue of gunshot residue on the victimâ€™s hands and their failure to cross-examine the Stateâ€™s gunshot residue expert was neither deficient nor prejudicial to Ard.Â  Â Â  Â \r\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must show (1) the performance of counsel was deficient and, (2) but for the errors of counsel, the result of the trial would have been different.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). According to the majority, Ardâ€™s two trial counsel were deficient in failing to pursue the Stateâ€™s gunshot residue expert witness vigorously enough with respect to his conclusion that the victim had no gunshot residue on her hands.Â  The majority also finds Ardâ€™s counsel failed to adequately perform their own investigation into the gunshot residue results.Â  The facts, in my opinion, are to the contrary.\r\nIn preparation for trial, Ardâ€™s counsel did, in fact, hire their own gunshot residue expert to review the gunshot residue test results furnished by the State.Â  Counsel did not ultimately produce this expert as a witness at trial because, upon review of the test results, the expert then indicated to trial counsel that he concurred with the Stateâ€™s expertâ€™s conclusion. Instead, at trial, the State called the expert originally obtained by Ard to testify that he had agreed with the Stateâ€™s own expertâ€™s findings.Â  In my opinion, Ardâ€™s trial counsel appropriately countered this testimony with a cross-examination which called into question the accuracy of the gunshot residue test results.Â  Specifically, counsel elicited testimony from the expert suggesting that the process of fingerprinting the victim would have â€œinterferedâ€ with the gunshot residue test results if done prior to trace evidence collection.Â  Simply stated, Ardâ€™s trial counsel sufficiently dealt with the adverse evidence.Â  The fact that Ardâ€™s counsel could not force their own qualified expert to tailor his opinion to fit their theory of the case, in my view, is an insufficient basis on which to conclude that these counsel were deficient.Â Â  \r\nThe majority bases its conclusion in part on the PCR courtâ€™s finding that the expert retained by Ardâ€™s counsel was not â€œindependentâ€ because of his prior involvement with the gunshot residue analysis during his employment with SLED.Â  In my opinion, this is rank speculation, not supported by any evidence of bias in the record.Â  Without more, this assumption does not support the majorityâ€™s conclusion that selection of this expert by counsel was unreasonable.Â  \r\nMoreover, in the face of unfavorable gunshot residue results, counsel for Ard independently investigated the facts and circumstances of the case by performing their own thorough investigation of the crime scene and hiring experts in both engineering and crime scene investigation in order to corroborate Ardâ€™s account of the gunâ€™s accidental discharge.Â  Counsel also developed their theory on the accuracy of the gunshot residue results by interviewing three witnesses regarding the handling of the victimâ€™s body at the scene.Â  In light of these independent investigations, the fact that counsel did not conduct pre-trial questioning of the Stateâ€™s expert on the results of the gunshot residue analysis, in my opinion, does not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. Â See Simpson v. Moore, 367 S.C. 587, 627 S.E.2d 701 (2006) (â€œA decision â€˜not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counselâ€™s judgments.â€™â€)Â  \r\nAdditionally, the record shows a thorough factual explanation by the Stateâ€™s expert who testified that there were not enough indicator particles to conclude there was gunshot residue on the victimâ€™s hand.Â  Again, in my view the fact that Ardâ€™s trial counsel could not force the Stateâ€™s gunshot residue expert to change his opinion is an insufficient basis on which to conclude that these counsel were deficient.Â  Moreover, the fact that eight years later, PCR counsel were finally able to retain an expert who reached a conclusion favorable to Ardâ€™s case (i.e. that the victimâ€™s hands contained traces of gunshot residue) does not imply that trial counsel were deficient for failing to find such an expert at the time of the trial.[18]Â  To hold otherwise declares open season on the criminal justice system by giving a â€œsecond chanceâ€ to any convicted criminal who is patient enough to seek out an â€œexpertâ€ who will one day provide him with the opinion testimony he desires. [19]Â  Â Â \r\nFurthermore, even if these trial counsel were deficient, Ard failed to demonstrate that the deficiency prejudiced his case.Â  The State presented twenty witnesses to show that Ard killed the victim with malice.Â  Although the State emphasized the lack of gunshot residue in its closing argument, in my opinion, the State presented other overwhelming evidence from which a jury could find Ard guilty of murder.\r\nAlthough not addressed by the majority because of their findings on ineffectiveness of trial counsel, Ard also claimed that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to directly appeal the dismissal of a juror during the sentencing phase.Â  The jurorâ€™s qualifications came under scrutiny after the second day of the sentencing phase when the jurorâ€™s wife approached the trial judge complaining that her husbandâ€™s jury duty was causing hardship for the family because of his inability to work.Â  The jurorâ€™s wife also commented that her husbandâ€™s religious beliefs would not permit him to vote for the death penalty.Â  When asked by the trial court during an in camera conference about his ability to be a fair juror, the juror responded that although he believed he could render a fair verdict under normal circumstances, the fact that his wife had raised doubts in the partiesâ€™ minds as to his ability to be fair made him feel â€œtargetedâ€ regardless of his ultimate decision.Â  When further questioned about his ability to vote for the death penalty, the juror stated, â€œI donâ€™t think I can be fair at this point.â€Â  Despite multiple reassurances from the court that this matter would remain private and that the juror would not be accountable to anyone for his vote, the juror reiterated his concerns that his decision â€œwould be a threatâ€ to him and concluded that he could no longer cast a fair vote.Â  The trial court released him from the jury.Â  \r\nIn my view, Ard did not show that the failure of appellate counsel to directly appeal the dismissal of the juror amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  In a PCR proceeding, the burden is on the applicant to prove the allegations in his application.Â  Patrick v. State, 349 S.C. 203, 207, 562 S.E.2d 609, 611 (2002).Â  Although Ard supported his argument that counsel was deficient with testimony from appellate counsel acknowledging that he erred in not raising the jurorâ€™s dismissal on appeal, Ard did not satisfy his burden of proof with a showing of how the jurorâ€™s dismissal prejudiced his case.Â  In my view, there was nothing prejudicial about the dismissal of a juror who stated that he would feel â€œtargetedâ€ as to his decision and ultimately admitted that he did not believe he could cast a fair vote.Â  Therefore, in my opinion, the PCR court incorrectly determined that the failure to directly appeal the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of a juror amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the actions of neither trial counsel nor appellate counsel resulted in prejudice against Ard.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse the PCR courtâ€™s finding of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure of trial counsel to adequately investigate and challenge the gunshot residue.Â  I would also reverse the PCR courtâ€™s finding of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure of appellate counsel to raise the issue of the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of a juror on direct appeal.\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] Johns also testified that he told respondent he was going to call the police and asked respondent what he should tell them.Â  According to Johns, respondent replied: â€œTell them I did it and they will have to catch me.â€Â  On cross-examination, however, trial counsel referred to Johnsâ€™ written statement given to police on the date of the incident which did not include the phrase â€œthey will have to catch me.â€\r\n[2]  However, when Powell was recalled by the State in reply, respondentâ€™s counsel did cross-examine him about how most of the gunshot residue would have been expelled through the end of the barrel of the gun.Â  Trial counsel also questioned Powell regarding the fact that samples from Coffeyâ€™s hands might not have been taken until after the body was moved to the hospital for the autopsy and that moving the body around might cause removal of the residue. \r\n[3] The gunshot residue analysis was performed by Powell in 1993.Â  Avery left SLED in 1995.Â  Prior to the April 1996 trial, respondentâ€™s counsel hired Avery as a consultant to re-examine the analysis which had been done by Powell and reviewed by Avery.\r\n[4] These matters were also testified to on cross-examination by some of the Stateâ€™s witnesses.\r\n[5] The Stateâ€™s firearms expert testified that the gun, a Charter Arms .44 caliber double action revolver, required only three to three and one quarter pounds of pressure on the trigger to cause the gun to fire when the gun was cocked. \r\n[6] One of the Stateâ€™s witnesses on cross-examination corroborated that when she saw respondent during this time in Atlanta, he was upset or sleeping.Â  One of respondentâ€™s witnesses, Jerry Logue, testified that while respondent was staying at his apartment these days in Atlanta, he was upset, crying, did not eat, and spent most of the time sleeping.\r\n[7] Throughout the guilt phase, the defense consistently challenged, both on cross-examination of State witnesses and through defense witnesses, the manner in which evidence was collected and the processing of the crime scene.\r\n[8] Ard was the first South Carolina case where feticide was used to support the death penalty.Â  This Court held that the Legislature intended to include a viable fetus as a â€œpersonâ€ or â€œchildâ€ as those terms are used in S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(9) &amp; (10), the aggravating circumstances of murdering â€œtwo or more personsâ€ and â€œmurder of a child eleven years of age or under.â€\r\n[9]  In addition, the PCR court granted respondent a new sentencing trial based on appellate counselâ€™s failure to raise on direct appeal an issue involving the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of a juror during the sentencing phase.Â  Because we affirm the PCR courtâ€™s grant of a new trial to determine guilt, we need not address the Stateâ€™s remaining issue related to sentencing. Â See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n[10] At his deposition, Powell specifically stated the following with regard to Coffeyâ€™s gunshot residue tests:\r\n\r\nIf this person had handled the gun, grabbed it in some way, done [sic] something to knock it away this could be consistent with it.Â  I have seen this happen where people have handled weapons.Â  Iâ€™ve seen chunky [i.e., non-round] particles and Iâ€™ve seen - this is well within the realm of possibility.\r\n\r\nDuring his direct examination at the PCR hearing, Powell stated that under the â€œcurrent protocol,â€ the results would permit a finding of â€œmay be consistent with gunshot residue.â€Â  \r\n[11] Powell specifically stated at the PCR hearing that if counsel had questioned him about the â€œinterestingâ€ particles, he would have testified as follows:Â  â€œâ€˜The report is reading as no gunshot residue detected, and that is my position, but there are some things here which if - can they come from a gun?Â  Yes.Â  But they may not be from a gun.â€™â€Â  Likewise, at the deposition, Powell stated that because there were two (non-round) particles found on Coffey with the required three elements, this â€œabsolutelyâ€ indicated - even in 1996, the time of trial - that a weapon was involved.Â  Regarding those two particles, Powell stated â€œ[t]hat is absolutely something which I do not find without usually a weapon.â€\r\n[12]  Although counsel had filed discovery motions in March 1994, Duncan and Fullwood testified they received 1200 pages of documents on February 2, 1996.Â  When trial counsel received this discovery was approximately when they first were informed the trial would be in April 1996.Â  Counsel moved for a continuance in March 1996, but the trial court denied the motion.\r\n[13] When asked if Avery was counselâ€™s first choice for a gunshot residue expert, Fullwood responded, â€œWell the thing was that there wasnâ€™t - We were under such time constraints there was no such thing as trying to make a choice about anything.â€\r\n[14]  In Strickland, the United States Supreme Court explained that â€œ[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards and the like â€¦ are guides to determiningâ€ whether counselâ€™s performance is reasonable.Â  Strickland v. Washington,&nbsp;466 U.S. at 688.Â  More recently, the Supreme Court again clearly enunciated that the reasonableness of counselâ€™s conduct may be measured by the ABAâ€™s guidelines for capital defense.Â  Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003).Â  Additionally, â€œ[t]he ABA standards are not aspirational in the sense that they represent norms newly discovered after Strickland.Â  They are the same type of longstanding norms referred to in Strickland in 1984.â€Â  Hamblin v. Mitchell, 354 F.3d 482, 487&nbsp;(6th Cir. 2003).\r\n[15] We reject the dissentâ€™s suggestion that we are holding it was a lack of time which caused counselâ€™s unreasonable decision regarding the retention of Avery as respondentâ€™s gunshot residue expert.Â  Indeed, we agree with the dissent that counsel â€œexpeditiouslyâ€ retained an expert.Â  We disagree, however, with the dissentâ€™s view that this expert must be presumed to be an appropriate one.Â  Given his previous involvement in the case while employed with SLED, any presumption about his objectivity is untenable.Â Â  \r\n[16] The Deputy Solicitor specifically argued in closing that the defense could not attack Powellâ€™s testimony â€œbecause their own expert, Mike Avery, was hired by the defense to review Mr. Powellâ€™s workâ€¦.Â  He found no fault with Joe Powellâ€™s findingsâ€¦.â€\r\n[17]  The trial court instructed the jury that involuntary manslaughter is the â€œunlawful killing of another without malice, express or implied, by some act or omission constituting criminal negligence.Â  Criminal negligence is the reckless disregard of the safety of others.â€Â  The trial court further instructed the jury that if there was a reasonable doubt as to whether respondent was guilty of murder or manslaughter, then the jury must â€œgive him the benefit of the doubt and find him guilty of manslaughter.â€Â  During the guilt phase, there was much testimony about drug use and drug dealing by respondent and his acquaintances.Â  There was also testimony about how respondent carried a gun and that the gun was on the floor of the trailer before Coffey was shot.Â  Considering this evidence, we find the jury could have believed respondentâ€™s account and yet could have also decided that respondent recklessly disregarded the safety of his pregnant girlfriend and unborn son, therefore allowing the jury to return a verdict of involuntary manslaughter.\r\n[18] The record shows that trial counsel received the Stateâ€™s gunshot residue results on February 2, 1996, and the underlying raw data on March 1, 1996.Â  The majority implies that the time between February 2, 1996, and April 15, 1996, when the trial was scheduled to begin, was insufficient for trial counsel to retain a qualified gunshot residue expert.Â  However, those in the legal profession are well aware that trial preparation does not occur in a perfect world.Â  In my view, we must presume Ardâ€™s trial counsel operated appropriately and expeditiously in retaining their expert because there is no evidence that the expert, a former supervisor in SLEDâ€™s trace evidence department, was biased or otherwise unqualified to perform an accurate evaluation of the Stateâ€™s results on such â€œshort notice.â€Â  \r\n[19] Additionally, I note that in support of their conclusion that trial counsel were deficient, the majority cites extensively to American Bar Association (ABA) guidelines on the prevailing norms of practice. The majority justifies their reliance on ABA guidelines by pointing to an endorsement of ABA standards in Strickland v. Washington.Â  In my opinion, however, the Strickland court makes it clear that the ABA standards, although helpful, are â€œonly guidesâ€ for assessing reasonableness.Â  466 U.S. at 688.Â  In fact, the Strickland court cautions:Â  \r\n\r\nÂ No particular set of detailed rules for counselâ€™s conduct can satisfactorily take &nbsp;account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant. Any such set of rules would interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions. \r\n\r\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688-89.Â  This Court has never adopted the ABA guidelines as the standard for prevailing professional norms in South Carolina.Â  Therefore, in my view, â€œreasonablenessâ€ in the instant case is best assessed in the broader context suggested by Strickland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26283","title":"Fici v.

Â Further, he denied Sellersâ€™ request for attorneyâ€™s fees. Â The Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1. Is the conveyance enforceable?\r\n2. Are Sellers entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees under the contract?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBUYERâ€™S APPEAL\r\nStatute of Frauds\r\nThe Statute of Frauds, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10 (1991), provides in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nÂ§ 32-3-10.Â  Agreements required to be in writing and signed. \r\nNo action shall be brought whereby:\r\n  \r\n. . .\r\n  \r\n(4) To charge any person upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments or any interest in or concerning them; \r\n  \r\n. . .\r\n  \r\nUnless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the Statute of Frauds, every essential element of the contract must be expressed in a writing signed by the party to be compelled.Â  Cash v. Maddox, 265 S.C. 480, 220 S.E.2d 121 (1975); Speed v. Speed, 213 S.C. 401, 49 S.E.2d 588 (1948).[3]Â  The burden of proof is on the party seeking to enforce the contract.Â  Cash, supra.\r\nIn the context of a land sale, a description of the property must be in a signed writing; parol evidence cannot supply this essential element.Â \r\nJackson v. Frier, 118 S.C. 449, 110 S.E. 676 (1922); Hyde v. Cooper, 34 S.C. Eq. (13 Rich. Eq.) 250 (1867).Â  Parol evidence may be used only to explain terms appearing in the description;[4] the signed writings must contain a sufficient description of the land to show with reasonable certainty what is to be conveyed.Â Â  Cash, 265 S.C. at 484, 220 S.E.2d at 122.[5]Â  A description that does not include the location of the land or its boundaries is inadequate.Â  Humbert v. Brisbane, 25 S.C. 506 (1886).Â  Where there is no adequate description of which part of a parcel is to be conveyed, the conveyance is unenforceable.Â  Cash, supra; Cousar v. Shepherd-Will, Inc., 300 S.C. 366, 387 S.E.2d 723 (Ct. App. 1990).Â Â  \r\nHere, the master considered two signed writingsâ€”the form contract signed February 27 and the 1960 plat with roughed-in property lines.Â  The form contract does not contain a description of the property to be conveyed except to specify that it is â€œat least thirty acres,â€ and indicates that Buyer and Sellers were to agree on property lines.Â  The 1960 plat, according to the testimony, was never intended to indicate the final boundaries but was to be the basis of the surveyorâ€™s plat.Â  The master, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, found these documents insufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.Â  We agree.Â  A conveyance of land is unenforceable if the contract provides only that the boundaries are to be determined upon agreement to a subsequent survey and plat.Â  Hyde v. Cooper, supra.Â  The signed form contract dated February 27 is nothing more than an agreement to agree which is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.Â  \r\nBuyer contends the master erred in failing to consider other documents surrounding the proposed sale which supply the required description of the land to be conveyed.Â  Buyer points to the surveyorâ€™s plat recorded with the written restrictions.Â  This plat divides the fifty-acre parcel into three tracts, two in Sellersâ€™ names individually and one jointly in both Sellersâ€™ names.Â  The plat itself is not signed by Sellers.Â  Sellers did sign the restrictions filed with the plat, but these restrictions apply to the entire fifty acres and do notÂ  indicate Sellersâ€™ assent to the property lines within the fifty-acre parcel for purposes of the sale to Buyer.Â  In fact, the undisputed testimony indicates Sellers were never satisfied with the plats prepared by the surveyor.Â  Buyer also points to a hold-harmless agreement with Richland County acknowledging that the county had no responsibility for maintaining the access road on the property.Â  This document was signed by the parties in contemplation of dividing the property.Â  It does not, however, include any description of individual tracts but refers only to the entire fifty-acre parcel. Â \r\nThe Statute of Frauds requires that the agreement to be enforced must contain a writing, signed by Sellers, with a description of the property to be conveyed.Â  The documents Buyer points to do not satisfy this requirement.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the denial of specific performance.Â  In light of our disposition on this issue, we need not address Buyerâ€™s remaining issues.\r\nSELLERSâ€™ APPEAL\r\nAttorneyâ€™s fees\r\n\r\nSellers contend they are entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees as the prevailing party under the contract.Â  The contract provides:\r\n  \r\n19.Â  DEFAULTÂ  . . . . Upon default by the Seller, the Purchaser shall have the option of suing for damages or specific performance, or rescinding the Contract. . . . In any action to enforce the provisions of this Contract, the prevailing party and Broker(s) shall be entitled to the award of their costs, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(underscore added).Â  \r\nThe master denied Sellersâ€™ request for attorneyâ€™s fees under this provision based on his finding that the contract was unenforceable.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding it was impossible for either party to default under the unenforceable contract and therefore attorneyâ€™s fees were properly denied.Â  We find this analysis incorrect because the contract is not void in its entirety.\r\nFirst, paragraph 19 of the contract provides that if Sellers default, Buyer may bring an action to enforce the contract or may rescind it.Â  Here, Buyer chose to bring an action to enforce the contract and it was her burden to prove a default.Â  The attorneyâ€™s fee provision, which applies â€œ[i]n any action to enforce the provisions of this Contract,â€ awards fees to the prevailing party.Â  Sellers successfully proved there was no default since the conveyance is unenforceable.Â  Under the terms of the contract, Sellers are entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees as the prevailing party.\r\nThe Statute of Frauds does not affect the validity of the attorneyâ€™s fee provision but is simply a defense to the conveyance.Â  See Duckett v. Pool, 33 S.C. 238, 11 S.E. 690, 689-91 (1890) (a contract violating the Statute of Frauds is â€œneither void nor voidable . . . the validity of the contract is not affected but simply the right of action to enforce it.â€); Hillhouse v. Jennings, 60 S.C. 392, 38 S.E. 596 (1901).Â  The Statute of Frauds is an affirmative defense.Â  See Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  As with any affirmative defense, the party successfully asserting it is a prevailing party and therefore entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees where provided by contract.Â  Accord Dickinson, Inc. v. Balcor Income Props. Ltd., 745 P.2d 1120 (Kan. App. 1988) (enforcing attorneyâ€™s fee provision after finding other provision of agreement unenforceable under Statute of Frauds).Â  \r\nSellers submitted proof of $43,483.28 in attorneyâ€™s fees they incurred in defending Buyerâ€™s action.Â  At the proceeding below, Buyer stipulated that this amount of attorneyâ€™s fees claimed by Sellers under the contract is reasonable.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the master for entry of judgment for attorneyâ€™s fees in this amount.\r\nIn addition, Sellers contend they are entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees from the bond posted under the terms of a temporary injunction dissolved by the master in his final order on the merits.Â  The circuit court issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Sellers from conveying the property and charging them with maintaining it.Â  As part of this order, the court required that Buyer maintain a bank account with the amount of the net sale proceedsÂ  ($325,335) as security during the pendency of the action.Â  The order states that â€œsuch an arrangement will be adequate to protect [Sellers] for the payment of any costs or damages incurred by them as a result of the imposition of the Temporary Injunction.â€[6]Â  Sellers claim they are entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees from this security bond as â€œcosts or damagesâ€ caused by the temporary injunction.Â  Further, they contend the master should have held Buyer in contempt for closing this account before the resolution of post-trial motions.\r\nFees paid for defending an action to which the injunction is merely ancillary are not recoverable from the security bond.Â \r\nWalker v. Oswald, 181 S.C. 278, 186 S.E. 916, 919 (1936); Livingston v. Exum, 19 S.C. 223 (1883).Â  In an action to determine the rights of parties in reference to land, as here, an injunction is considered ancillary.Â  Hill v. Thomas, 19 S.C. 230 (1883).Â  Attorneyâ€™s fees for successfully ending the temporary injunction as part of this suit are therefore not recoverable under the injunction security bond.Â  Since Sellers are not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees from this security bond, there is no harm from Buyerâ€™s closing of the account.Â  Accordingly, we find the contempt issue moot.Â  SeeÂ  Sloan v. Friends of Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 630 S.E.2d 474 (2006) (case is moot where a judgment rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect). \r\nIn conclusion, we affirm the denial of specific performance, reverse the denial of attorneyâ€™s fees to Seller, and remand for entry of judgment in the stipulated amount of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Causes of action regarding Agent are not at issue in this appeal. \r\n[2] This is public information from the assessorâ€™s office online at http://www.richlandonline.com/services/assessorsearch/assessorsearch.asp. \r\n[3] A contemporaneous writing specifically identified in the signed writing qualifies as part of the signed agreement.Â  Hyde v.

Â We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent pleaded guilty to second offense trafficking in crack cocaine and third offense possession with intent to distribute (PWID) crack cocaine.Â  The plea judge sentenced Respondent to fifteen yearsâ€™ imprisonment for trafficking and fifteen years for PWID, to be served concurrently.[1]Â  No direct appeal was taken.Â  \r\nRespondent filed this PCR application alleging the plea court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence him for second offence trafficking and third offense PWID.Â  The PCR judge found the plea court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence Respondent for second offense trafficking and third offense PWID because the indictments listed the statutory provisions for first offenses.Â  The PCR judge resentenced Respondent to ten yearsâ€™ imprisonment for first offense trafficking in crack cocaine and to fifteen years for first offense PWID crack cocaine.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err in finding the plea court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to sentence Respondent for second offense trafficking in crack cocaine and third offense PWID crack cocaine?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v.

State, 357 S.C. 646, 651, 594 S.E.2d 462, 465 (2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge erred in finding the plea court lacked subject matter. Â We agree. \r\nWe address this issue in light of our decision in State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  In Gentry, we abandoned the view that, in criminal matters, the circuit court acquires subject matter jurisdiction to hear a particular case by way of a valid indictment.Â  363 S.C. at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499.Â  â€œ[S]ubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Id. at 100, 610 S.E.2d at 498.Â  Issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.Â  Id. at 100, 610 S.E.2d at 498.Â Â  Â Â \r\nIn contrast, an indictment is a notice document.Â  The primary purposes of an indictment are to put the defendant on notice of what he is called upon to answer, i.e., to apprise him of the elements of the offense and to allow him to decide whether to plead guilty or stand trial, and to enable the circuit court to know what judgment to pronounce if the defendant is convicted.Â  Id. at 102-03, 610 S.E.2d at 500; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).Â  A defendant must challenge the sufficiency of an indictment before the jury is sworn.Â  Gentry, 363 S.C. at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (2003).Â  \r\nIn light of Gentry, Respondent raised an issue related to the sufficiency of the indictments in his PCR application, rather than an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The plea court, as a court of general sessions, had subject matter jurisdiction to accept Respondentâ€™s guilty pleas and to sentence Respondent as a subsequent offender.Â  Gentry, 363 S.C. at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499; see also State v. Smalls, 364 S.C. 343, 346, 613 S.E.2d 754, 756 (2005) (finding the court of general sessions has subject matter jurisdiction to try criminal cases).Â  Accordingly, the PCR judge erred in finding the plea judge did not have subject matter jurisdiction to accept Respondentâ€™s guilty pleas and to sentence Respondent.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s grant of relief and uphold Respondentâ€™s convictions.Â  We need not address the Stateâ€™s remaining issue.Â  See Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711 (2005) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Respondent also pleaded guilty to PWID crack cocaine within proximity of a school and second offense possession of marijuana.Â  He was sentenced to ten yearsâ€™ imprisonment for PWID within proximity of a school and one year for possession of marijuana, to be served concurrently with his other sentences.Â  These guilty pleas are not at issue in this PCR action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26285","title":"Vaughan v.

Vaughan, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Charles G. Vaughan, Jr., (Appellant) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of McLeod Regional Medical Center and Thomas Wilson, M.D. (collectively referred to as Respondents).Â  We certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and we affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn November 4, 2000, Charles G. Vaughan, Jr. (Decedent) was treated at McLeod Regional Medical Center for injuries arising out of an automobile accident.Â  Upon admission, Dr. Wilson noted Decedent had an elevated blood alcohol level, and Decedent was detoxed by Dr. Theresa Gallagher during his hospitalization.Â  \r\nOn November 22, 2000, Appellant, who was Decedentâ€™s wife, and Decedentâ€™s adult daughter filed a petition for the appointment of a guardian for Decedent in the Marlboro County Probate Court.Â  Appellant also petitioned for the appointment of a conservator for Decedent.Â  On the same day, Judge P. Mark Heath appointed Dr. Wilson and Dr. Gallagher to examine Decedent and to report their findings regarding Decedentâ€™s mental capacity to the probate court, as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-303 (1987).Â  At a hearing that day, Judge Heath heard testimony from Appellant and received the court-ordered reports from Dr. Wilson and Dr. Gallagher.Â  The doctors described Decedent as a chronic alcoholic with dementia secondary to alcohol abuse.Â  Both doctors found Decedent was an â€œincapacitated personâ€[1] and was impaired by reason of mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, and chronic intoxication.Â  Dr. Wilson and Dr. Gallagher further found this condition to be permanent.Â  Based on the evidence, Judge Heath found Decedent was incapacitated.Â  He appointed guardians, a conservator, and an attorney with the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem for Decedent.Â  On January 31, 2001, Judge Heath signed an order declaring that Decedent was no longer incapacitated.[2]Â  \r\nAppellant subsequently brought this action against Respondents[3] alleging, among other things, Dr. Wilson and Dr. Gallagher negligently and erroneously informed her and the Marlboro County Probate Court that Decedent was permanently incapacitated.Â  On Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondents.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Â  Respondents?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA circuit court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the circuit court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 385, 365 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995) (â€œThe determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.â€).Â  We are free to decide a question of law with no particular deference to the circuit court.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-70(A)\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in finding Respondents were not subject to civil liability pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-70(A) (2002).Â  During oral argument before this Court, Respondents conceded the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on this ground. \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-70(A) provides: â€œA person who in good faith makes a health care decision as provided in Section 44-66-30 is not subject to civil or criminal liability on account of the substance of the decision.â€Â  Section 44-66-30 (2002) sets forth a prioritized list of persons who may make health care decisions for a patient who is unable to consent.Â  Specifically, Â§ 44-66-30(A)(3) gives priority to â€œa person given priority to make health care decisions for the patient by another statutory provision.â€\r\nThe circuit court determined Â§ 44-66-30(A)(3) allows a person to make health care decisions for a patient unable to consent when priority is given by another statutory provision.Â  The circuit court then held S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-303 gave Dr. Wilson priority to make the health care decision that Decedent was permanently incapacitated.Â  Finding the record was devoid of any evidence that Dr. Wilson did not act in good faith, the circuit court granted summary judgment to Respondents based on the immunity provided by Â§ 44-66-70(A).Â  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989). Â If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, then â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  The words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced\r\nconstruction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).\r\nSection 44-66-70(A) gives immunity to a person who in good faith makes a health care decision pursuant to Â§ 44-66-30 for a patient who is unable to consent.Â  Section 44-66-30(A)(3) allows a person to make health care decisions for a patient who is unable to consent when priority is given by another statutory provision.Â  Section 62-5-303 clearly is not another statutory provision that gives priority because Â§ 62-5-303 sets forth the requirements for court appointment of a guardian upon a finding of incapacity.[4]Â  See Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 402, 175 S.E.2d 805, 817 (1970) (â€œ[W]here the language [of a statute] is clear and explicit, the courts cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into the statute which are not in the legislatureâ€™s language.â€).Â  Â Â \r\nThe circuit court improperly construed Â§ 62-5-303 to be another statutory provision giving priority as referenced by Â§ 44-60-30(A)(3).Â  Thus, the circuit court erred in applying the good faith immunity, provided by Â§ 44-66-70(A) for persons who make health care decisions under Â§ 44-66-30, to Dr. Wilsonâ€™s decisions pursuant to court appointment under Â§ 62-5-303.Â  Furthermore, Dr. Wilson did not make any health care decisions[5] pursuant to Â§ 44-66-30 for Decedent.Â  Dr. Wilson provided health care to Decedent by diagnosing, treating, and caring for Decedent during his hospitalization, and he performed a court-ordered examination of Decedent.Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred in applying the good faith immunity provided by Â§ 44-66-70(A) to Dr. Wilsonâ€™s actions during Decedentâ€™s hospitalization and pursuant to his court appointment.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Common-Law Immunity\r\nRespondents argue the grant of summary judgment in their favor should be affirmed on the ground of common-law immunity.Â  We agree.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record).\r\nThe issue of whether common-law immunity extends to a physician, who is court-appointed to serve as an examiner of an allegedly incapacitated person in a guardianship proceeding, is analogous to the issue of whether common-law immunity extends to a private person, who is court-appointed to serve as a guardian ad litem in a private child custody proceeding.Â  For that reason, this Courtâ€™s analysis of the latter issue in Fleming v. Asbill, 326 S.C. 49, 483 S.E.2d 751 (1997) is instructive.Â  In finding common-law immunity applied to court-appointed guardians ad litem for actions within the scope of their appointment, the Fleming Court explained:\r\n\r\nIn addition to preserving the independence and neutrality of theÂ Â Â Â Â  guardian ad litem, a grant of immunity also is reasonable in light of the Â Â Â Â Â Â  fact that many court-appointed guardians have not volunteered for the Â Â Â Â Â  position. Â It is inequitable for persons who did not ask to be appointed Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  as guardian to be exposed to unlimited liability. \r\n. . .\r\nBecause one of the guardianâ€™s roles is to act as a representative of the Â Â Â  court, and because this role can only be fulfilled if the guardian is not Â  exposed to a constant threat of lawsuits from disgruntled parties, a finding of quasi-judicial immunity is necessary.Â  Such a grant of Â Â Â Â Â  immunity is crucial in order for guardians to properly discharge their Â Â Â Â Â  duties. Â The immunity to which guardians ad litem are entitled is an Â  absolute quasi-judicial immunity.\r\n\r\n326 S.C. at 56-57, 483 S.E.2d at 755-56.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe find the reasoning that supports a finding of absolute quasi-judicial immunity for court-appointed guardians also supports a finding of absolute quasi-judicial immunity for court-appointed examiners in guardianship proceedings.Â  Court-appointed examiners are essentially an arm of the judiciary.Â  See generally Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325, 335, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 1115-16, 75 L.Ed.2d 96, 108 (1983) (â€œ[T]he common law provided absolute immunity from subsequent\r\ndamages liability for all persons-governmental or otherwise-who were integral parts of the judicial process.â€); Hartline v. Clary, 141 F.Supp. 151, 152 (E.D.S.C. 1956) (â€œ[J]udicial officers, quasi judicial officers, judges, prosecuting attorneys, executive and ministerial officials of the government\r\nare immune from civil suit for acts committed by them in the performance of their official duties.â€); 70 C.J.S. Physicians and Surgeons Â§ 101 (2005) (â€œA psychiatrist or other mental health practitioner appointed by the court to make a psychiatric evaluation of a person or to give an opinion as to his or her sanity enjoys immunity from suit for damages based on such opinion or evaluation, where he or she has acted in accordance with the governing statute.â€).Â  Additionally, quasi-judicial immunity for acts performed within the scope of appointment is necessary to protect the court-appointed examiners from lawsuits by allegedly incapacitated persons who are upset by the results of the guardianship proceedings.Â  If court-appointed examiners in guardianship proceedings are not afforded immunity, the exposure to liability will have a chilling effect on future acceptances of such appointments.Â  We hold a physician, who is a court-appointed examiner in a guardianship proceeding, has absolute quasi-judicial immunity for actions and opinions within the scope of the appointment.[6]Â  \r\nWe must determine from the nature of Dr. Wilsonâ€™s actions, not merely by his status as a court-appointed examiner, whether the absolute quasi-judicial immunity extends to the challenged acts in this case.Â  See generally Falk v. Sadler, 341 S.C. 281, 288, 533 S.E.2d 350, 353-54 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œIt is the nature of the acts, not simply the status of the defendant as a guardian ad litem, that determines the availability of immunity for the challenged acts and the extent of protection afforded by that immunity.â€).Â  Appellant does not dispute Decedent was temporarily incapacitated.Â  Appellant alleges Dr. Wilson failed to properly diagnose Decedentâ€™s true condition and made an erroneous diagnosis of Decedentâ€™s condition.Â  These allegations are based on Appellantâ€™s unhappiness with the doctorâ€™s finding of permanent incapacity.Â  This type of allegation is precisely why absolute quasi-judicial immunity must be extended to court-appointed examiners in guardianship proceedings.Â  Dr. Wilsonâ€™s opinion that Decedent was permanently incapacitated was made within the scope of his court appointment; thus, he was protected from civil liability by absolute quasi-judicial immunity.Â  See generally id. at 288, 533 S.E.2d at 354 (â€œA recommendation by the guardian ad litem, no matter how disagreeable to one of the parties, will not\r\nsustain an action against the guardian of this sort.â€); Bailey, 100 S.E.2d at 867 (â€œPhysicians, who are witnesses, in judicial proceedings to commit an alleged mentally disordered person for confinement, have been accorded such absolute immunity from civil liability for\r\ntheir material and pertinent affidavits, certificates and testimony.â€).Â  Accordingly, Respondents are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause absolute quasi-judicial immunity protects the challenged acts and opinions of Dr. Wilson in this case, we affirm as modified the grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondents.Â Â  \r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â â€œIncapacitated personâ€ is statutorily defined to mean â€œany person who is impaired by reason of mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, advanced age, chronic use of drugs, chronic intoxication, or other cause (except minority) to the extent that he lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible decisions concerning his person or property.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-101(1) (Supp. 2006).\r\n[2]Â  We note we placed Decedent, an attorney licensed to practice in this State, on incapacity inactive status on December 7, 2000 and we reinstated him to active status on January 22, 2003.\r\n[3] Â Although Dr. Gallagher was originally named as a defendant, she is not a party to this appeal.\r\n[4]Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-303(b) requires, in relevant part, that once a petition for guardianship is filed, â€œ[t]he person alleged to be incapacitated shall be examined by two examiners, one of whom shall be a physician appointed by the court[,] who shall submit their reports in writing to the court.â€\r\n[5] Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-20(1) (2002) (defining â€œ[h]ealth careâ€ to mean: â€œa procedure to diagnose or treat a human disease, ailment, defect, abnormality, or complaint, whether of a physical or mental origin.Â  It also includes the provision of intermediate or skilled nursing care; services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons; and the placement in or removal from a facility that provides these forms of careâ€).\r\n[6]Â  Other courts have extended immunity to physicians who are court-appointed for actions within the scope of their appointment.Â  See Bartlett v. Weimer, 268 F.2d 860 (7th Cir. 1959) (determining court-appointed doctor, who opined that plaintiff was mentally incompetent, was acting as an officer of state probate court in giving opinion as to mental health of plaintiff, and thus, doctor was protected by quasi-judicial immunity); Cawthon v. Coffer, 264 So.2d 873 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1972) (concluding psychiatrists who were appointed by the court to determine plaintiffâ€™s mental and physical condition were immune from suit by plaintiff for conduct within scope of appointment); Seibel v. Kemble, 631 P.2d 173 (Haw. 1981) (holding court-appointed psychiatrists were acting as arms of court in rendering an opinion on criminal defendantâ€™s competency, and thus, court-appointed psychiatrists were protected from suit by absolute judicial immunity); Linder v. Foster, 295 N.W. 299 (Minn. 1940) (holding a physician, who was a court-appointed examiner in an insanity proceeding, was a quasi-judicial officer, and as a quasi-judicial officer was immune from civil action for acts performed in connection with the court appointment); Mullen v. McKnelly, 693 S.W.2d 837, 838 (Mo. Ct. App. 1985) (â€œWhen a physician has been appointed to examine a person and give an opinion as to the mental health of said person the physician enjoys the same immunity extended to judges and other judicial officers.â€); Bailey v. McGill, 100 S.E.2d 860 (N.C. 1957) (holding court-appointed physicians, who were required to examine a patient and certify an opinion regarding the patientâ€™s mental competency, were immune from tort liability for actions arising out of their appointment).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26286","title":"In the Matter of Michael H.

Â In the transactions, respondent failed to disclose to the lenders that the purchasers did not bring to the closing the funds represented on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.Â  Furthermore, respondent did not disclose to the lender that the sellersâ€™ funds as represented on the settlement statement were â€œshortedâ€ in order to balance the statement. \r\nFollowing the real estate closings at issue in the indictment, respondent was asked by other parties to reissue certain closing checks differently than as represented on the closing statement.Â  Respondent agreed to reissue the checks as requested.Â Â  \r\nWhile it was alleged in the indictment that the co-conspirators committed a wide variety of fraudulent acts in connection with these transactions and received substantial funds from the proceeds of the transactions, respondent was not aware of these activities.Â  Respondent did not receive any illicit funds but, rather, only his standard fee for conducting a closing.Â  \r\nRespondent terminated his business relationship with the parties in these transactions in the Spring of 2003.Â  He did not repeat the misconduct.Â  When respondent was contacted by law enforcement authorities, he fully cooperated with the investigation and provided substantial assistance to investigators who thereafter prosecuted four other individuals.Â  Â \r\nRespondent pled guilty in the United States District Court to a one count indictment alleging conspiracy to defraud two mortgage companies.Â  He was sentenced to a period of house arrest, three years of probation, and ordered to pay restitution.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (lawyer shall not commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); and Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).Â  In addition, respondent admits that his actions constitute grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for a lawyer to be convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or serious crime); and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for twelve (12) months, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating he has complied with the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent shall not seek reinstatement until he has fully completed his house arrest and probation and complied with all other conditions imposed by his federal court sentence.Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  WALLER, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] See In the Matter of Spell, 365 S.C. 42, 618 S.E.2d 929 (2005) (on August 24, 2005, respondent was placed on interim suspension).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26289","title":"Davis v.

Emory Smith, Jr., for Respondent Governor. Larry Cornell Smith, of Richland County Attorneyâ€™s Office, M. Elizabeth Crum, Francenia B. Heizer, and Robert T. Bockman, all of McNair Law Firm, of Columbia, for Respondent Richland County Council.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: This is an appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s denial of a temporary injunction to stay enforcement of Act No. 207, 2005 Acts 1961.Â  At issue is the constitutionality of the Act, which altered the method of appointment of the members of the Richland County Recreation Commission (Commission). Â We hold Act No. 207 constitutes unconstitutional special legislation.Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nThe (Commission) was created by Act No. 873, 1960 S.C. Acts 2010.Â  Act No. 873 provided that the Commission was to be â€œcomposed of five resident electors of the recreational district to be appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the Richland County Legislative Delegation. . .â€Â  \r\nIn 2005, by Act No. 207, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 808, stating, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  The authority to make the appointment of the members of the Richland County Recreation Commission is devolved from the Richland County Legislative Delegation to the governing body of Richland County. The terms of the members of the commission appointed by the Richland County Legislative Delegation expire on June 30, 2005.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).Â  The Act took effect upon the Governorâ€™s approval on June 1, 2005.Â  \r\nOn July 11, 2005, Davis, et. al. (Appellants), members of the Commission at the time the Act was passed, filed a summons and complaint seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the Act, and requesting an injunction.Â  They also filed a motion for an ex parte temporary restraining order to prevent the Richland County Council from enforcing Act No. 207.Â  The circuit court granted the ex parte TRO, finding the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm from the existence of two competing boards.Â  The court also found a likelihood of success on the merits under this Courtâ€™s opinion in Hamm v. Cromer, 305 S.C. 305. 408 S.E.2d 227 (1991).\r\nAfter a hearing, the circuit court denied the plaintiffsâ€™ motion for a preliminary injunction and dissolved the temporary injunction, finding they had not met the requirements for an injunction.Â  The court found, inter alia, Â a) the plaintiffs lacked standing because they were no longer members of the Commission at the time they filed for an injunction, b) the plaintiffs were not in danger of an imminent threat of irreparable harm, c) the plaintiffs had little likelihood of success on the merits because they lacked standing, and d) the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Did the circuit court err in ruling the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge Act No. 207 and that they had not met the requirements of demonstrating the need for an injunction?\r\n  2.Â  Is Act No. 207 unconstitutional?\r\n\r\n1.Â  STANDING/INJUNCTION\r\nThe circuit court ruled Appellants lack standing to bring this action because they filed suit after their terms expired (pursuant to Act No. 207).Â  This was error. \r\n In numerous recent cases, this Court has found that standing is not inflexible and standing may be conferred upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.Â  Sloan v. Depâ€™t of Transportation, 365 S.C. 299, 618 S.E.2d 876 (2005) (finding Sloan had standing to bring actions for alleged violation of statutory bidding violations by the DOT); Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d 579 (2005) (holding Sloan had standing to challenge legislative enactment).Â  Additionally, both this Court and the Court of Appeals have found standing in other cases of important public interest without requiring the plaintiff to show he has an interest greater than other potential plaintiffs. See id.; Sloan v. Sanford, 357 S.C. 431, 593 S.E.2d 470 (2004) (holding standing to challenge governorâ€™s commission as officer in Air Force reserve); Sloan v. Greenville Cty., 356 S.C. 531, 548, 590 S.E.2d 338, 347 (Ct.App.2003) (holding plaintiff had standing to bring declaratory judgment action alleging county failed to comply with ordinances governing procurement). Furthermore, under the public importance exception, standing may be conferred upon a party â€œwhen an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.â€Â  Baird v. Charleston Cty., 333 S.C. 519, 531, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999).\r\nWe find the Commissioners have standing to challenge the constitutionality of an Act which authorizes their removal from office.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is reversed in this regard. \r\n2.Â  CONSTITUTIONALITY OF ACT 207\r\nIn addition to seeking an injunction, the Commissioners sought a declaratory judgment establishing that Act No. 207 was unconstitutional.Â  The circuit court did not reach the declaratory judgment issue, in light of its finding that Appellants did not have standing to challenge Act 207.[1]Â  \r\nThis issue hinges upon an interpretation of this Courtâ€™s prior opinions in Hamm v. Cromer, 305 S.C. 305. 408 S.E.2d 227 (1991) and Pickens County v. Pickens Water and Sewer Authority, 312 S.C. 218, 439 S.E.2d 840 (1994).Â  \r\nIn Hamm, the governing body of the Newberry County Water and Sewer Authority was to be composed of seven resident electors of Newberry County, to be appointed by the Governor upon a recommendation of a majority of the members of the Newberry County Legislative Delegation.Â  In 1988, the Legislature adopted Act No. 784, 1988 S.C. Acts 6447, which changed the method of appointment for the governing body of the Sewer Authority, taking the recommendation authority away from the local legislative delegation, and giving it to the members of the Newberry County Council.Â  The Act further provided that the terms of the present governing members of the Authority would expire on the effective date of the Act.Â  \r\nHamm brought a declaratory action seeking to have Act No. 784 declared unconstitutional, claiming it violated the constitutional prohibition against special legislation contained in S.C. Const., art. VIII, Â§Â§ 1 and 7[2].Â Â  He also argued Act 784 did not fall within any exception or category of permissible special legislation, and that Act No. 784 was neither remedial nor transitional in nature.Â  The trial court ruled in favor of respondents, and held Act No. 784 unconstitutional special legislation.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this Court recognized that, by ratification of Article VIII in 1973, the General Assembly was prohibited from enacting laws for a specific county or municipality.Â  A majority of this Court held:\r\n\r\n  The prohibition of Section 7 is applicable to special legislation dealing with districts created prior to the ratification of Article VIII or the amendment of prior special legislation. . . .Â  Because Act No. 784 amended prior special legislation which created the Authority, the prohibition of Section 7 of Article VIII applies.Â Â  The enactment of Act No. 784 is exactly the type of special legislation which is prohibited by Sections 1 and 7 of Article VIII of the South Carolina Constitution as it was not intended that after the ratification of the constitutional amendment, the General Assembly could repeatedly inject itself into local affairs.\r\n\r\n305 S.C. at 308, 408 S.E.2d at 228-229.Â  The Court went on to recognize that Section 1 of Article VIII allowed the General Assembly to legislate to bring about an orderly transition to local home rule government, but that such authority was temporary and extended only so far as necessary to place Article VIII fully into operation. [3]Â  Â â€œHowever, [Section 1] limited transitional legislation to a â€˜one shotâ€™ proposition so that the General Assembly could not repeatedly inject its will into the operation of county government.â€Â  Id. at 308, 408 S.E.2d at 229.Â  The Court recognized that once a legally constituted government has become functional, the DuncanÂ  exception ends, thereby precluding any further special legislation.Â  The Court held, â€œthe local form of government, a public service district, which was organized long before the ratification of Article VIII, has remained in continuous and successful operation since that time and thus, Act No. 784 cannot be considered remedial legislation.â€Â  Id.[4]Â Â  \r\nThereafter, in Pickens County v. Pickens Water and Sewer Authority, 312 S.C. 218, 439 S.E.2d 840 (1994), the County commenced a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that 1973 Act No. 757 was unconstitutional.Â Â  Act No 757 created the Pickens County Water and Sewer Authority and empowered it with the authority to provide water and sewer service county-wide wherever such service was not provided by a municipality.Â  Act No. 757 also repealed 1971 Act No. 240 which had created the Pickens County Water Authority.Â Â  The trial judge declared Act No. 757 unconstitutional and ruled that Act No. 240 was revived.Â  A majority of this Court held that Act No. 757 did not come under the transitional legislation exception and was squarely controlled by Hamm.Â Â Â  \r\nHere, Act No. 207 takes the authority to recommend Richland County Recreation Commission members away from the Richland County Legislative Delegation, and gives that authority to the Richland County Council; it also provides that the terms of the then-current members of the commission appointed by the Richland County Legislative Delegation expire on June 30, 2005.Â  Much like the Act held unconstitutional in Hamm, the Act here seeks to devolve appointment authority of a local body away from the Legislative Delegation, and confer it upon the County Council.Â  Accordingly, Hamm and Pickens are squarely controlling, and Act No. 207 is indeed unconstitutional.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court erred in finding Appellants without standing to challenge the constitutionality of Act No. 207.Â  In the interest of judicial economy, we address the merits of the underlying declaratory judgment action and hold that, under Hamm and Pickens, Act No. 207 is unconstitutional special legislation. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent for the same reasons that I dissented in Hamm v. Cromer, 305 S.C. 305, 309-10, 408 S.E.2d 227, 229-30 (1991).Â  In my opinion, the majority continues to ignore the essential purpose and intent of the constitutional provisions enacted to aid in â€œhome rule.â€Â  See S.C. Constitution, Art. VIII, Â§Â§ 1 and 7 (significantly diminishing the power of the legislature to continuously engage itself in matters of local government).Â  \r\nAct No. 207 devolves the authority of the Richland County Legislative Delegation to recommend the appointment of the members of the Richland County Recreation Commission (Commission) to Richland County Council.Â  This action clearly furthers the intent of Â§Â§ 1 and 7 to diminish legislative interaction in local government.Â  Because Richland County Council has never had the legal authority to appoint the members of the Commission, in my opinion, the transfer of authority under Act No. 207 constitutes the establishment of initial county government.Â  See Horry County v. Cooke, 275 S.C. 19, 23, 267 S.E.2d 82, 84 (1980) (limiting the Duncan exception to the establishment of initial county governments).Â  Therefore, instead of continuing to invalidate such legislation and preserving legislative interference in local governmental affairs, I would hold Act 207 constitutional as â€œone shotâ€ legislation under Duncan v. County of York, 267 S.C. 327, 228 S.E.2d 92 (1976).Â  \r\nBased on the reasons above, I respectfully dissent.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because they also sought a declaratory judgment, we proceed to a review of the issue in the interest of judicial economy.Â  See Jeter v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 369 S.C. 433, 633 S.E.2d 143 (2006); Floyd v. Horry County School District, 351 S.C. 233, 569 S.E.2d 343 (2002); Furtick v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Probation, Parole &amp; Pardon Servs., 352 S.C. 594, 576 S.E.2d 146 (2003) (addressing merits of claim in the interest of judicial economy).\r\n[2] Â Article VIII, Â§ 1 provides, â€œ[t]he powers possessed by all counties, cities, towns, and other political subdivisions at the effective date of this Constitution shall continue until changed in a manner provided by law.â€Â  Section 7 provides, in pertinent part, â€œ[n]o laws for a specific county shall be enacted and no county shall be exempted from the general laws or laws applicable to the selected alternative form of government.â€Â  In Hamm, the Court recognized that the prohibition against special legislation contained in Article VIII, meant that no law could be passed concerning a specific county which related to those powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities, which under the mandated systems of government, were set aside for counties.Â  305 S.C. at 307, 408 S.E. 2d at 228, citing Kleckley v.

Hoefer, II, of Ballenger Barth &amp; Hoefer, LLP, of Florence, for respondent.Â Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand or definite suspension not to exceed sixty (60) days pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and impose a sixty (60) day suspension.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nComplainant had a child with respondentâ€™s son-in-law.Â  On June 21, 2006, respondentâ€™s son-in-law appeared in Family Court for a hearing to determine the son-in-lawâ€™s child support obligation to complainant.Â  It is respondentâ€™s understanding that, based upon information provided by his son-in-law, the child support set at the hearing included an amount for the childâ€™s daycare fees at a collegeâ€™s Child Development Center.Â  \r\nAfter the hearing, the son-in-law expressed concern about whether the child was actually enrolled in the collegeâ€™s daycare center.Â  Respondentâ€™s daughter, on behalf of her husband, contacted the college to inquire about whether the child was enrolled and attending the daycare.Â  Respondentâ€™s daughter thereafter reported to respondent that the college would not release the information to her.Â  At that time, respondent told his daughter to ask whether a subpoena from the magistrateâ€™s court would enable the college to release the information.Â  Respondentâ€™s daughter did as respondent suggested and advised respondent the college would accept a subpoena.Â  \r\nRespondent then prepared and issued a subpoena which he captioned â€œSouth Carolina Family Courtâ€ with Case Number â€œ0665954.â€Â  The subpoena requested documents from the college regarding the childâ€™s enrollment and attendance at the daycare.Â  The subpoena was sent to the college by facsimile with a cover sheet from the Hartsville Magistrateâ€™s Office and contained a notation that the documents should be forwarded to respondentâ€™s attention.Â  \r\nThe college did not comply with the subpoena.Â  On at least three occasions, respondent attempted to contact the college to determine when the documentation would be forwarded to him.Â  A few days later, an attorney representing the college contacted respondent and questioned respondentâ€™s authority to issue the subpoena.Â  At that point, respondent told the attorney to shred the subpoena.Â  At the attorneyâ€™s request, respondent sent the attorney a message by facsimile to ignore the subpoena.Â  \r\nRespondent now realizes he used his judicial position for the benefit of his son-in-law and that he was unfaithful to the law in issuing the subpoena.Â  Further, he realizes that, in effect, he may have misrepresented to college officials that they were bound by the subpoena when respondent knew or should have known that they were not.Â  Respondent recognizes he committed judicial misconduct. \r\nODC states that respondent has fully cooperated with its inquiries into these matters.Â  \r\nRespondent has prior disciplinary history.Â  On May 3, 2006, the Court issued an admonition to respondent.Â  In that matter, respondent issued a $30.00 check from his civil magistrate account to a motel to cover a one nightâ€™s stay for a litigant.Â  After receiving notice of ODCâ€™s complaint in that matter, respondent deposited the $30.00 back into his civil magistrate account.Â  Additionally, on March 15, 2005, the Commission on Judicial Conduct issued a letter of caution to respondent.Â  In that matter, respondent had committed minor misconduct because he had improperly issued a temporary restraining order without first notifying the defendant and without conducting a hearing with the defendant being present.[1]Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2B (judge shall not allow familial relationships to influence his judicial conduct or judgment; a judge shall not lend the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests of others); and Canon 3B(2) (judge shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it).Â  Respondent further admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Judgeâ€™s Oath of Office) of Rule 502, RJDE.Â  Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a suspension from judicial duties.Â  We therefore accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent for sixty (60) days.Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.

McMaster, in his official capacity as Attorney General of the State, (Appellants) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina (Respondent).Â  We certified the case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and we affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1993, after many years of litigation and extensive negotiations, Respondent, the State, and the United States entered into a settlement that ended a dispute over the right to possession of 144,000 acres of land located in York, Lancaster, and Chester counties.[1]Â  This settlement was memorialized in an Agreement in Principle (â€œSettlement Agreementâ€).Â  Federal legislation[2] (â€œFederal Actâ€) and state legislation[3] (â€œState Actâ€) implemented the Settlement Agreement.Â  The Federal Act requires the Settlement Agreement and the State Act to be complied with as if they had been implemented by federal law.Â  25 U.S.C.A. Â§ 941b(a)(2) (2001). \r\nAs part of the settlement, Respondent waived its right to be governed by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.[4]Â  25 U.S.C.A. Â§ 941l(a); Settlement Agreement Â§ 16.1.Â  Respondent instead agreed to be governed by the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the State Act with regards to games of chance.Â  25 U.S.C.A. Â§ 941l(b); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-16-110(A) (2007); Settlement Agreement Â§ 16.2.Â  The Settlement Agreement and the State Act give Respondent specific rights related to bingo and video poker or similar electronic play devices.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-16-110(B)-(H); Settlement Agreement Â§ 16.3-.9.Â  \r\nRespondent brought this declaratory judgment action against Appellants seeking, inter alia, a declaration that pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the State Act, Respondent has a present and continuing right to operate video poker or similar electronic play devices on its Reservation and a declaration that Respondent is not required to charge or pay an entrance fee imposed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-4030(B)(1) (2000) against its bingo operation.Â  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court ruled in favor of Respondent.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Respondent on the ground Respondent has the present and continuing right to operate video poker or similar electronic play devices on its Reservation?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Respondent on the ground the entrance fee imposed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-4030(B)(1) (2000) was not applicable to Respondentâ€™s bingo operation?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA circuit court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997). Â In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the circuit court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Â Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 385, 365 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below. Â Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995) (â€œThe determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.â€).Â  We are free to decide a question of law with no particular deference to the circuit court.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Video Poker\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondent on the ground the Settlement Agreement and the State Act give Respondent a present and continuing right to operate video poker or other similar electronic play devices on its Reservation. Â We agree.\r\n\r\nThe State Act provides:\r\n[Respondent] may permit on its Reservation video poker or similar\r\nelectronic play devices to the same extent that the devices are authorized by state law.\r\n[Respondent] is subject to all taxes, license requirements, regulations, and fees governing electronic play devices\r\nprovided by state law, except if the Reservation is located in a county or counties which prohibit the devices pursuant to state law,\r\n[Respondent] nonetheless must be permitted to operate the devices on the Reservation if the governing body of [Respondent] so authorizes, subject to all taxes, license requirements, regulations, and fees\r\ngoverning electronic play devices provided by state law.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. 27-16-110(G); see also Settlement Agreement Â§ 16.8 (same).Â  \r\nAppellants contend Â§ 27-16-110(G) does not enable Respondent to operate video poker devices on its Reservation regardless of a statewide ban on the devices.Â  Appellants argue the Settlement Agreement and the State Act provide Respondent with the right to permit or operate video poker devices on its Reservation only â€œto the same extent that the devices are authorized by state law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-16-110(G).Â Â  \r\nRespondent argues the Settlement Agreement and the State Act differentiate between the terms â€œpermitâ€ and â€œoperate,â€ such that Respondent may â€œpermitâ€ video poker devices on its Reservation â€œto the same extent that the devices are authorized by state law.â€Â  Id.Â  (emphasis added).Â  Respondent further argues it â€œnonetheless must be permitted to operate the devices on the Reservation if the governing body of [Respondent] so authorizesâ€ and if the counties where the Reservation is located prohibit the video poker devices.Â  Id.Â  (emphasis added).Â  Respondent contends because state law now prohibits video poker devices, Respondent may not give permission to third parties to place and maintain video poker machines on its Reservation.Â  Respondent further contends, as a sovereign, it may now operate the devices on its Reservation if its governing body authorizes the operation because the counties where the Reservation is located prohibit them.Â  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989). Â If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, then â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  The words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced\r\nconstruction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).\r\nThe language of Â§ 27-16-110(G) is unambiguous.[5] Â The first sentence of Â§ 27-16-110(G) provides that Respondent may permit video poker or similar electronic play devices on its Reservation â€œto the same extent that the devices are authorized by state law.â€Â  â€œ[P]ermitâ€ as used in the first sentence means â€œ[t]o allow.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1160 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Under the plain language of Â§ 27-16-110(G), Respondent may allow video poker devices on its Reservation, either by its own operation or a third-partyâ€™s operation, to the same extent state law authorizes the devices.Â  The terms permit and operate must be interpreted as such to effectuate the intent of the legislature.[6]Â  Furthermore, we reject Respondentâ€™s proposed construction of Â§ 27-16-110(G) because such construction would create an absurd result, which the legislature clearly did not intend.Â  See Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994) (â€œHowever plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention. . . . If possible, the court will construe the statute so as to escape the absurdity and carry the intention into effect.â€) (citing Stackhouse v. Rowland, 86 S.C. 419, 422, 68 S.E. 561, 562 (1910)).Â  The legislative intent was to circumscribe Respondentâ€™s right to allow video poker devices on its Reservation, either by its own operation or a third-partyâ€™s operation, to the extent state law allowed the devices.[7]Â Â  Â Â \r\nRespondent contends unlike Â§ 27-16-110(F), which requires its bingo license to be â€œrevoked if the game of bingo is no longer licensed by the State,â€ Â§ 27-16-110(G) does not include language requiring the termination of Respondentâ€™s possession or operation of video poker devices if state law bans the devices.Â  Respondent argues if its right to operate video poker devices was contingent upon state law allowing the devices, then language similar to that used in Â§ 27-16-110(F) would have been included in Â§ 27-16-110(G).Â  Respondentâ€™s argument is without merit because the rules of statutory construction are not applicable.Â  See Lester v. S.C. Workersâ€™ Comp. Commâ€™n, 334 S.C. 557, 561, 514 S.E.2d 751, 752 (1999) (finding a court employs the rules of statutory construction only when a statute is ambiguous). Â \r\nRespondent also contends it may operate video poker devices on its Reservation as a sovereign regardless of a statewide ban on the devices.Â  â€œThe [United States Supreme] Court has consistently recognized that Indian tribes retain â€˜attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory,â€™. . . , and that â€˜tribal sovereignty is dependent on, and subordinate to, only the Federal Government, not the States. . . .â€™Â  It is clear, however, that state laws may be applied to tribal Indians on their reservations if Congress has expressly so provided.â€ Â California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U.S. 202, 207, 107 S.Ct. 1083, 1087, 94 L.Ed.2d 244, 253 (1987) (citing United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 557, 95 S.Ct. 710, 717, 42 L.Ed.2d 706, 716 (1975) and Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 154, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 2081, 65 L.Ed.2d 10, 29 (1980)).Â  In this case, Congress expressly provided that â€œall laws, ordinances, and regulations of the State, and its political subdivisions, govern the regulation of gambling devices and the conduct of gambling or wagering by [Respondent] on and off the Reservation,â€ unless the Settlement Agreement and the State Act specifically provide otherwise.Â  25 U.S.C.A. Â§ 941l(b).Â  Generally, Respondent agreed to be â€œsubject to the civil, criminal, and regulatory jurisdiction of the State. . . and [to] the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State to the same extent as any other person, citizen, or land in the State. . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-16-40; see also Settlement Agreement Â§ 4.3.Â  Specifically, the Settlement Agreement and the State Act require state law to govern the conduct of gambling by Respondent, and the Federal Act requires the State Act to be complied with as if implemented by federal law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-16-110(A); see also Settlement Agreement Â§ 16.1; 25 U.S.C.A. Â§ 941b(a)(2).Â  By Congressâ€™s express approval of the State Act and by the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the State Act, Respondent relinquished any attributes of sovereignty relating to games of chance in this state.\r\nRespondent also argues because the Federal Act requires the consent of both Respondent and the State to amend the terms of the Settlement Agreement and State Act, any subsequent state legislative enactments are not applicable to Respondent unless Respondent consents to the enactments.Â  See 25 U.S.C.A. Â§ 941m(f).Â  The State Act is a contract between Respondent and the State, and â€œ[i]t is a fundamental rule of contract construction that the law existing at the time and place of the making of a contract is a part of the contract.â€Â  City of North Charleston v. North Charleston Dist., 289 S.C. 438, 442, 346 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1986).Â  â€œHowever, statutes and ordinances enacted subsequent to the execution of a contract, which add burdens or impair the obligations of the contract, may not be deemed to be a part of the agreement unless the language of the agreement clearly indicates this to have been the intention of the parties.â€Â  17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 372 (2004).Â  The first sentence of Â§ 27-16-110(G) clearly binds Respondent to any subsequent state legislative enactments affecting video poker devices.Â  The inclusion of the phrase â€œto the same extent that the devices are authorized by state lawâ€ is indicative of the partiesâ€™ intent for Respondent to be subject to any future changes in state law regarding video poker devices.[8]Â  See, e.g., Lewis v. Quality Coal Corp., 270 F.2d 140, 142 (7th Cir. 1959) (finding the phrase â€œto the extent and in the manner permitted by lawâ€ required â€œconformity to existing or future lawâ€); State ex rel. Ferguson v. City of Wichita, 360 P.2d 186, 191-92 (Kan. 1961) (finding contractual phrase â€œto the extent authorized by state lawâ€ included future legislation).Â  Â Â \r\nII.Â  Entrance Fee\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in concluding the general entrance fee imposed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-4030(B)(1) is not applicable to Respondentâ€™s bingo operation.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe State Act provides in relevant part:\r\n[Respondent] shall pay, in lieu of an admission, a head, a license,\r\nor any other bingo tax, a special bingo tax equal to ten percent for each Â Â Â  dollar of face value for each bingo card sold. Â No other federal, state, or\r\nlocal taxes apply to revenues generated by the bingo games operated by [Respondent]. Â \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-16-110(C)(3) (emphasis added); see also Settlement Agreement Â§ 16.4.3 (same).Â  Section 12-21-4030(B)(1) requires certain bingo license holders, including Respondent, to impose â€œan entrance fee of eighteen dollars.â€ \r\nSection 27-16-110(C)(3) states Respondent must pay a special bingo tax instead of an admission or, in other words, an entrance fee.Â  The imposition of Â§ 12-21-4030(B)(1) against Respondentâ€™s bingo operation violates the plain language of Â§ 27-16-110(C)(3).Â  Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994) (â€œWhen statutory terms are clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction and courts are required to apply them according to their literal meaning.â€).Â  In addition, the entrance fee cannot be imposed against Respondent because the Federal Act requires the consent of both the State and Respondent to amend the terms of the State Act, and Respondent did not consent to this amendment.Â  25 U.S.C.A. Â§ 941m(f)(1) (requiring the consent of both Respondent and the State if the amendment relates to â€œthe jurisdiction, enforcement, or application of civil, criminal, regulatory, or tax laws of [Respondent] and the Stateâ€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the State Act, Respondent has the right to allow video poker and similar electronic play devices on its Reservation, either by a third-partyâ€™s operation or its own operation, to the same extent the devices are authorized by state law.Â  We reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondent on this ground and remand to the circuit court for entry of judgment in favor of Appellants.Â  We also affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondent on the issue related to the bingo entrance fee.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n MOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Diane S. Goodstein, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â See generally South Carolina v. Catawba Indian Tribe, Inc., 476 U.S. 498, 106 S.Ct. 2039, 90 L.Ed.2d 490 (1986) (describing the historical background of this land dispute); 25 U.S.C.A. Â§ 941(a)(4) (2001) (describing the historical background which led to the Settlement Agreement); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-16-20 (2007) (same).\r\n[2] Â 25 U.S.C.A.

Â§Â§ 2701-2721 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2006).\r\n[5]Â  The circuit court was persuaded by the affidavit of Crawford Clarkson, the Stateâ€™s lead negotiator of the Settlement Agreement, in making its ruling.Â  The circuit court erroneously relied on Clarksonâ€™s affidavit and erroneously considered the affidavits submitted by Appellants in conjunction with their motions for summary judgment and for reconsideration because the statute is not ambiguous.Â  See Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 373, 585 S.E.2d 292, 298 (2003) (finding there is no need to employ the rules of\r\nstatutory construction when the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous).Â  Moreover, even if the statute was ambiguous, affidavits of drafters of the statute and legislators are not admissible as evidence of legislative intent.Â  Kennedy v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 353-54, 549 S.E.2d 243, 250 (2001). \r\n[6]Â  In the same year it enacted the State Act, the legislature also enacted a local option law permitting counties to hold an individual referendum to determine whether cash payouts for video gaming should remain legal.Â  Act No. 164, Part II, Â§ 19G, 1993 S.C. Acts 1138-1139, formerly codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-21-2806 and -2808 (repealed effective July 1, 2000).Â  In light of this historical fact, the phrase in the second sentence of the State Act that refers to Respondentâ€™s right to operate video poker devices if â€œthe Reservation is located in a county or counties which prohibit the devicesâ€ does not refer to a statewide ban on video poker devices; rather, it refers to a countyâ€™s ban on the devices.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-16-110(G).Â  This history further demonstrates the legislatureâ€™s clear intention to limit Respondentâ€™s right to operate video poker devices on its Reservation to the same extent state law authorizes such devices.Â  See Greenville Baseball, Inc. v. Bearden, 200 S.C. 363, 368, 20 S.E.2d 813, 815-16 (1942) (â€œA statute as a whole\r\nmust receive a practical, reasonable and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design and policy of the lawmakers.Â  And the history of the period in which the [statute] was passed may be considered.â€).\r\n[7]Â  We note state law presently bans the possession and operation of video poker devices.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2710 (2000).Â  Therefore, under the plain language of Â§ 27-16-110(G), Respondent may not currently allow the devices on its Reservation. \r\n[8]Â  Respondent also argues it is not bound by the current prohibition on video poker devices because the Settlement Agreement and the State Act were not â€œspecifically modified or expressly repealedâ€ as required by Act No. 125 of 1999, Pt. V, Â§ 22(C).Â  Act No. 125 of 1999 enacted the current legislation prohibiting the possession and operation of video poker devices.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2710.Â  Because the State Act requires future state law related to video poker devices to apply to Respondent, Respondentâ€™s argument is meritless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to Rule 402, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2007-03-12-01","description":"","date":"2007-03-19","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nRE: Amendments to Rule 402, SCACR\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Board of Law Examiners is responsible for   preparing and grading the essay portion of the South Carolina Bar Examination.   Before determining that an applicant has failed an essay section of the   examination, the Board conducts an extensive internal review process. This   process includes the grading of the failing section on at least two separate   occasions with the applicant being given the benefit of the highest score.\r\nUnder our current rule, applicants are allowed to review and   seek re-grading of their papers. In this regard, South Carolina is one of only a   very few states to allow for review and re-grading after the examination results   have been released.\r\nIn our opinion, the internal review process conducted by the   Board is more than sufficient to insure that any error in grading is determined   before the examination results are released. Therefore, we have decided to   delete the current provisions allowing for review and re-grading after the   results are released, bringing this jurisdiction in line with the overwhelming   majority of other jurisdictions.\r\nAccordingly, pursuant to Article V, &sect;4 of the South Carolina   Constitution, Rule 402(i), SCACR, is amended to read as follows:\r\n(i) Bar Examination.\r\n\r\n  (1) When Given. The Bar Examination shall be   conducted twice each year on the last consecutive Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday   in February and July.\r\n  (2) Content; Grading; Passing. The Bar   Examination shall consist of seven (7) sections. Six (6) of these sections shall   be composed of essay questions prepared by the Board of Law Examiners. The Chair   of the Board shall assign a member of the Board to prepare and grade or   supervise the preparation and grading of each essay section. The Multistate Bar   Examination shall be the seventh (7th) section. To pass the Multistate portion   of the Examination, an applicant must attain a scaled score of at least 125. To   pass an essay section, the applicant must obtain a score of seventy (70). Once   an applicant reaches seventy (70) points on an essay section, that section will   receive a passing grade and will not be graded further. An applicant must pass   six (6) of the seven (7) sections to pass the Bar Examination; provided,   however, that an applicant who receives a scaled score of 110 or less on the   Mulitstate Bar Examination shall fail the Bar Examination without any grading of   the essay questions. The Board shall notify the Clerk of the Supreme Court of   the results of the essay sections.\r\n\t \r\n  (3) Anonymous Grading; Prohibited Comments in Answer   Sheets and Booklets. Applicants taking the Bar Examination shall be   assigned an identification number that shall be used for the purposes of taking   and grading the Examination. Except for the identification number and any other   information the applicant may be directed to provide by those administering the   Examination, answer sheets or booklets for the Examination shall contain no   other information revealing the identity of the applicant. Any reference to the   applicant's economic status, social standing, employment, personal hardship or   other extraneous information in the answer sheets or booklets is prohibited. \r\n\t \r\n  (4) Notification of Results. The Clerk of the   Supreme Court shall send a letter to each applicant advising the applicant   whether the applicant passed or failed the Bar Examination. Additionally, the   names of those passing the Examination and the identification numbers of those   failing the Examination shall be posted on the South Carolina Judicial   Department Website. \r\n\t \r\n  (5) Access to Examination Answers; Re-grading or Other   Review. No applicant shall be given access to the answers the applicant   submitted during the examination. The results reported by the Board of Law   Examiners are final, and no applicant shall be allowed to seek re-grading or any   other review of the results of the examination.\r\n  (6) Request for Verification of Multistate Bar   Examination. While no review or inspection of the Multistate Bar   Examination (MBE) will be permitted, an applicant may request a hand grading of   the MBE. Any such request must be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court   along with the applicable fee within fifteen days of the date of the letter of   notification in (4) above.\r\n  (7) Prohibited Contacts. An applicant shall   not, either directly or through an agent, contact any member or associate member   of the Board of Law Examiners or any member of the Supreme Court regarding the   questions on any section of the Bar Examination, grading procedures, or an   applicant's answers. This provision does not prohibit an applicant from seeking   verification of the MBE score as permitted by (6) above.\r\n  (8) Cheating on the Bar Examination. An   applicant who cheats, aids or assists another applicant in cheating on the Bar   Examination, or attempts to cheat or aid or assist another in cheating, shall be   guilty of contempt of the Supreme Court of South Carolina and may be punished   accordingly. In addition, if it is determined that an applicant has cheated or   aided or assisted another in cheating, the applicant shall fail the examination   and the Court may prohibit the applicant from reapplying for up to five years.   Further, if the applicant has already been admitted, the Court may vacate the   admission or discipline the lawyer under Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nThis amendment shall be effective June 1, 2007, and shall apply   to all bar examinations conducted after that date. \r\n \r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

\r\nOn November 24, 2004, ODC sent respondent a copy of Complainant Bâ€™s complaint with a request that she provide a written response within fifteen (15) days in accordance with Rule 19(b), RLDE.Â  Respondent did not respond as requested.Â  \r\nOn January 19, 2005, ODC sent respondent a reminder letter, again requesting a written response to the complaint and reminding her of her obligations pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).Â  Respondent did not respond as requested.Â Â  \r\nOn March 7, 2005, ODC served respondent with a notice of full investigation which included direction that she respond in writing within thirty (30) days in accordance with Rule 19(c), RLDE.Â  Respondent did not respond until December 1, 2005, almost eight months after her response was due. \r\nODC has reviewed the SCCEJ file regarding Complainant Bâ€™s legal matter and finds no misconduct on respondentâ€™s part.Â  Respondent acknowledges that her failure to respond and her complete disregard of her obligations to cooperate in this investigation caused ODC to expend unnecessary time and effort.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by her misconduct she has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  See Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver funds to which a third party is entitled), Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority), and Rule 8.4 (a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  In addition, respondent acknowledges that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to bring legal profession into disrepute), and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail to comply with the terms of a finally accepted deferred disciplinary agreement).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for her misconduct.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Simpson (â€œSimpsonâ€) entered into a contract whereby Simpson traded in her 2001 Toyota 4Runner for a new 2004 Dodge Caravan.Â  Directly above the signature line on the first page of the contract, the signee was instructed in bold to â€œSEE ADDITONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON OPPOSITE PAGE.â€ Â The additional terms and conditions contained an arbitration clause stating the following:\r\n\r\n10.Â Â Â Â  ARBITRATIONÂ  Any and all disputes, claims or controversies between Dealer and Customer or between any officers, directors, agents, employees, or assignees of Dealer and Customer arising out of or relating to:Â  (a) automobile warranty, workmanship, or repair; (b) the terms or enforceability of the sale, lease, or financing of any vehicle; (c)Â  any claim of breach of contract, misrepresentation, conversion, fraud, or unfair and deceptive trade practices against Dealer or any officers, directors, agents, employees, or assignees of Dealer; (d) any and all claims under any consumer protection statute; and (e) the validity and scope of this contract, shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.Â  The parties expressly waive all rights to trial by jury on such claims. Provided, however, that nothing in this contract shall require Dealer to submit to arbitration any claims by Dealer against customer for claim and delivery, repossession, injunctive relief, or monies owed by customer in connection with the purchase or lease of any vehicle and any claims by Dealer for these remedies shall not be stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.Â  The filing fees for arbitration shall be paid by the party initiating arbitration.Â  The arbitrator may allocate the other arbitration fees as he/she deems appropriate.Â  In addition to any discovery permitted by the Commercial Arbitration rules, any party may take one disposition [sic] of an opposing party.Â  The parties agree to exchange all exhibits to be used in arbitration 7 days before arbitration.Â  The arbitrator shall determine the controversy in accordance with the terms of this contract between the parties and shall not consider any parole evidence which purports to alter, modify, vary, add to, or contradict such contract.Â  The arbitrator shall give effect to all applicable statutes of limitation.Â  Any arbitration under this agreement shall take place in Horry County, South Carolina and Customer agrees that the courts of Horry County , South Carolina shall have exclusive jurisdiction over enforcement of this contract and any award made by any arbitrator pursuant to this contract.Â  In no event shall the arbitrator be authorized to award punitive, exemplary, double, or treble damages (or any other damages which are punitive in nature or effect) against either party.Â  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, no claims against Dealer shall be consolidated with other claims in the nature of a class action.\r\n\r\nSix months later, Simpson filed a complaint in the Horry County court of common pleas alleging Addy violated the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act and the South Carolina Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act by misrepresenting the trade-in value of the vehicle, artificially increasing the purchase price, and failing to provide all rebates promised.Â Â Â  Simpson sought damages consistent with the maximum statutory remedies permitted for violations of these statutes.\r\nAddyâ€™s answer denied Simpsonâ€™s allegations and asserted that the contract between the parties contained an arbitration clause such that the matter should be stayed and that Simpsonâ€™s only remedy was to file for arbitration.Â  Addy contemporaneously filed a motion for protective order and/or to stay and compel arbitration.Â  Thereafter, Simpson filed a memorandum in opposition to Addyâ€™s motion alleging that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and unenforceable.Â  \r\nAt the motion hearing, the trial court ordered the parties to attempt mediation.Â  After the parties notified the trial court that mediation failed, the trial court issued an order denying Addyâ€™s motion on the grounds that the arbitration clause was unconscionable.Â  Addy filed this appeal.\r\nÂ The case was certified to this Court from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and Addy raises the following issues for review: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n       Did the lower court err in ruling that the arbitration clause was unenforceable without first submitting the issue of enforceability to arbitration?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n       Did the lower court err in denying Addyâ€™s motion to stay the civil litigation pending arbitration?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review \r\nArbitrability determinations are subject to de novo review.Â  Wellman, Inc. v. Square D Co., 366 S.C. 61, 67, 620 S.E.2d 86, 89 (Ct. App. 2005).Â Â  Nevertheless, a circuit court's factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if any evidence reasonably supports the findings.Â  Thornton v. Trident Med. Ctr., L.L.C., 357 S.C. 91, 94, 592 S.E.2d 50, 51 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis \r\nI.&nbsp; The appropriate forum for determining the validity of the arbitration clause. \r\nAs a preliminary matter, Addy contends that the trial court erred in ruling on the arbitration clauseâ€™s enforceability rather than first submitting that issue of enforceability to arbitration.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA) generally provides that where one party denies the existence of an arbitration agreement raised by an opposing party, a court must immediately determine whether the agreement exists in the first place.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(a)(2005).Â  If no agreement is found to exist, the court must deny any application to arbitrate. [1] Â Â Id.Â  \r\nOur precedents in this area echo the UAAâ€™s policy that the trial court should determine the threshold validity of the arbitration agreement.Â  See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118 (â€œThe question of the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination, unless the parties provide otherwise.â€); Hous. Auth. of the City of Columbia v. Cornerstone Hous., LLC, 356 S.C. 328, 334, 588 S.E.2d 617, 620 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œThe initial inquiry to be made by the trial court is whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties.â€).Â  Such rulings are based on the contractual nature of arbitration agreements.Â  See Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 37, 524 S.E.2d 839, 843-44 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œArbitration is available only when the parties involved contractually agreed to arbitrate.â€).Â Â Â  \r\nThis proposition finds support in other jurisprudence.Â  The United States Supreme Court has noted that, in limited circumstances, a court should assume that the parties intended the court to decide certain arbitration issues in the absence of â€œclear and unmistakableâ€ evidence to the contrary.Â  Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444, 452 (2003) (quoting AT&amp;T Techs., Inc. v. Commcâ€™ns Workers, 475 U.S. 643, 649 (1986)). These limited circumstances typically involve certain â€œgateway matters,â€ such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all, or whether an arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy.Â \r\nId.Â  Thus, the prevailing authority supports the notion that courts may have at least a limited role where an arbitration clause otherwise applies.\r\nIn this case, the trial court was the proper forum for determining the enforceability of the arbitration clause in the contract between Simpson and Addy.Â  Although the clause specifically stated that arbitration applied to issues involving â€œthe validity and scope of this contract,â€ Simpson challenged the validity of the arbitration provision on grounds of unconscionability, bringing into question whether an arbitration agreement even existed in the first place.Â  Under the UAA, the question of this clauseâ€™s validity was for the court to decide.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(a) (2005).\r\nFurthermore, because Simpson has challenged the validity of the entire arbitration clause on grounds of unconscionability, there can be no â€œclear and unmistakableâ€ evidence that the parties actually agreed to arbitrate the gateway matter of the arbitration clauseâ€™s validity.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in ruling on the issue of validity instead of submitting the issue itself to arbitration.\r\nII.&nbsp; Denial of Addyâ€™s motion for protective order and/or to stay and compel arbitration. \r\nAddy argues that the trial court erred in denying Addyâ€™s motion for protective order and/or to stay and compel arbitration.Â  We disagree.\r\nThere is a strong presumption in favor of the validity of arbitration agreements because both state and federal policy favor arbitration of disputes.Â  Towles, 338 S.C. at 34, 524 S.E.2d at 842.Â  The South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA) provides that in any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce, a written provision to settle by arbitration shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10(a) (2005).Â  Unless a court can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should generally be ordered.Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118.\r\nDespite these clear rules, arbitration is a matter of contract law and is available only when the parties involved contractually agreed to arbitrate.Â Â Â  Towles, 338 S.C. at 37, 524 S.E.2d at 843-44.Â  Accordingly, a party may seek revocation of the contract under â€œsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity,â€ including fraud, duress, and unconscionability.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10(a).Â  Arbitration will be denied if a court determines no agreement to arbitrate existed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(a).\r\nGeneral contract principles of state law apply in a courtâ€™s evaluation of the enforceability of an arbitration clause.Â  Munoz, 343 S.C. at 539, 542 S.E.2d at 364.Â  In South Carolina, unconscionability is defined as the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms that are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept them.Â  Carolina Care Plan, Inc. v. United HealthCare Servs., Inc., 361 S.C. 544, 554, 606 S.E.2d 752, 757 (2004).Â  If a court as a matter of law finds any clause of a contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the unconscionable clause, or so limit its application so as to avoid any unconscionable result.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-302(1) (2003).Â  \r\nIn analyzing claims of unconscionability in the context of arbitration agreements, the Fourth Circuit has instructed courts to focus generally on whether the arbitration clause is geared towards achieving an unbiased decision by a neutral decision-maker.Â  See Hooters of Am., Inc. v. Phillips, 173 F.3d 933, 938 (4th Cir. 1999).Â  It is under this general rubric that we determine whether a contract provision is unconscionable due to both an absence of meaningful choice and oppressive, one-sided terms. \r\nA.&nbsp; Absence of meaningful choice\r\nAddy argues that the facts do not show that Simpson had no meaningful choice in agreeing to arbitrate.Â  We disagree.\r\nAbsence of meaningful choice on the part of one party generally speaks to the fundamental fairness of the bargaining process in the contract at issue.Â \r\nSee Carlson v. General Motors Corp., 883 F.2d 287, 295 (4th Cir. 1989).Â  In determining whether a contract was â€œtainted by an absence of meaningful choice,â€ id. at 295, courts should take into account the nature of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff; whether the plaintiff is a substantial business concern; the relative disparity in the partiesâ€™ bargaining power; the partiesâ€™ relative sophistication; whether there is an element of surprise in the inclusion of the challenged clause; and the conspicuousness of the clause.Â \r\nId. at 293.Â  See also Â Holler v. Holler, 364 S.C. 256, 269, 612 S.E.2d 469, 476 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œA determination whether a contract is unconscionable depends upon all the facts and circumstances of a particular case.â€ (quoting 17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 279 (2004))).Â  \r\nThere are many cases in this jurisdiction and others involving the enforceability of arbitration clauses in adhesion contracts between commercial entities and consumers.Â  Each transaction is analyzed on its own particular facts in conjunction with the federal and/or state policies favoring arbitration.Â  We begin our inquiry with a focus on the decisions of courts in Ohio, which have heard numerous cases in the very recent past specifically addressing issues of unconscionability of arbitration clauses embedded in adhesion contracts between automobile retailers and consumers.Â  See Long v. N. Ill. Classic Auto Brokers, 2006 WL 3783507 (Ohio Ct. App. 9th Dist. 2006); Felix v. Ganley Chevrolet, Inc., 2006 WL 2507469 (Ohio Ct. App. 8th Dist. 2006), Â Â Eagle v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 809 N.E.2d 1161 (Ohio Ct. App. 9th Dist. 2004); Battle v. Bill Swad Chevrolet,\r\nInc., 746 N.E.2d 1167 Â (Ohio Ct. App. 10th Dist. 2000).Â  \r\nThe Ohio courts characterize automobiles as a â€œnecessityâ€ and factor this characterization into a determination of whether a consumer had a â€œmeaningful choiceâ€ in negotiating the arbitration agreement. Â See, e.g., Eagle, 809 N.E.2d at 1175; Cf. Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 161 A.2d 69, 85 (N.J. 1960) (invalidating autoÂ  manufacturerâ€™s standard-form disclaimers of implied warranties because such disclaimers frustrated consumer protection legislation given that in modern times, â€œautomobiles are a common and necessary adjunct of daily lifeâ€).Â  In this same context, the Ohio courts have adhered to the idea that sales agreements between consumers and retailers â€œare subject to considerable skepticism upon review, due to the disparity in bargaining positions of the parties.â€Â  Eagle, 809 N.E.2d at 1179.Â  Under the Ohio courtsâ€™ rationale, â€œthe presumption in favor of arbitration clauses is substantially weaker when there are strong indications that the contract at issue is an adhesion contract, and the arbitration clause itself appears to be adhesive in nature. In this situation there arises considerable doubt that any true agreement ever existed to submit disputes to arbitration.â€Â  Williams v. Aetna Fin. Co., 700 N.E.2d 859, 866 (Ohio 1998).Â  \r\nTurning to the instant case, we first note that under general principles of state contract law, an adhesion contract is a standard form contract offered on a â€œtake-it-or-leave-itâ€ basis with terms that are not negotiable.Â  Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 541, 542 S.E.2d 360, 365 (2001).Â  Neither party disputes that the contract entered into by Simpson and Addy was an adhesion contract as such contracts are standard in the automobile retail industry.Â  Adhesion contracts, however, are not per se unconscionable.Â  Therefore, finding an adhesion contract is merely the beginning point of the analysis.Â  Lackey v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 330 S.C. 388, 395, 498 S.E.2d 898, 902 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nWe agree with the rationale of the Ohio courts and proceed to analyze this contract between a consumer and automobile retailer with â€œconsiderable skepticism.â€Â  Under this approach, we first observe that the contract between Simpson and Addy involved a vehicle intended for use as Simpsonâ€™s primary transportation, which is critically important in modern day society.Â  Applying the factors considered by the Fourth Circuit in analyzing arbitration clauses, we also acknowledge Simpsonâ€™s claim that she did not possess the business judgment necessary to make her aware of the implications of the arbitration agreement, and that she did not have a lawyer present to provide any assistance in the matter. But see Munoz, 343 S.C. 531, 542 S.E.2d 360 (failing to factor in the weaker partyâ€™s status as a consumer in analyzing an unconscionability claim in an arbitration agreement between a consumer and a lender).Â  Similarly, we note Simpsonâ€™s allegation that the contract was â€œhastilyâ€ presented for her signature. \r\nMoreover, regardless of the general legal presumptions that a party to a contract has read and understood the contractâ€™s terms,[2] we also find it necessary to consider the otherwise inconspicuous nature of the arbitration clause in light of its consequences.Â  The loss of the right to a jury trial is an obvious result of arbitration.Â  However, this particular arbitration clause also required Simpson to forego certain remedies that were otherwise required by statute.[3]Â  While certain phrases within other provisions of the additional terms and conditions were printed in all capital letters,[4] the arbitration clause in its entirety was written in the standard small print, and embedded in paragraph ten (10) of sixteen (16) total paragraphs included on the page.Â  Although this Court acknowledges that parties are always free to contract away their rights, we cannot, under the circumstances, ignore the inconspicuous nature of a provision, which was drafted by the superior party, and which functioned to contract away certain significant rights and remedies otherwise available to Simpson by law.Â  Furthermore, and contrary to Addyâ€™s argument, the present transaction may be distinguished from that in Carolina Care Plan, Inc. v. United HealthCare Services, Inc., 361 S.C. 544, 606 S.E.2d 752 (2004), where both parties were sophisticated business interests in an arms-length negotiation.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find that when considered as a whole and in the context of an adhesion contract for a vehicle trade-in, the circumstances reveal that Simpson had no meaningful choice in agreeing to arbitrate claims with\r\nAddy.\r\nB.&nbsp; Oppressive and one-sided terms\r\n1.&nbsp; Limitation on statutory remedies in an arbitration clause\r\nAddy contends that the arbitration clauseâ€™s limitation on statutory remedies was not oppressive and one-sided.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe arbitration clause in Simpsonâ€™s contract with Addy provides that â€œ[i]n no event shall the arbitrator be authorized to award punitive, exemplary, double, or treble damages (or any other damages which are punitive in nature or effect) against either party.â€Â  Simpsonâ€™s underlying complaint filed in civil court alleged, among other things, that Addy violated the South Carolina Uniform Trade Practices Act (SCUPTA) and the South Carolina Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act (Dealers Act).Â  The SCUPTA requires a court to award treble damages for violations of the statute.[5]Â  Similarly, the Dealers Act requires a court to award double damages for violations of the statute.[6]Â  \r\nIn arguing that this provision was not oppressive and one-sided, Addy relies on Carolina Care Plan.Â  In that case, this Court held that the issue of whether an arbitration clause prohibiting an arbitrator from awarding â€œpunitive damagesâ€ violated the public policy of the SCUTPA was not ripe for review.Â  361 S.C. 544, 606 S.E.2d 752.Â  The Court explained that â€œan arbitrator may or may not choose to award treble damages in accordance with the SCUTPA, depending upon whether an arbitrator finds the SCUPTA was violated and whether the arbitrator finds that statutory treble damages are punitive or compensatory damages.â€Â \r\nId. at 557, 606 S.E.2d at 759 (discussing PacifiCare Health Systems v. Book, 538 U.S. 401 (2003) (holding it was premature to conclude that meaningful relief for the plaintiff under RICO was unavailable in arbitration because the arbitrator may conclude that a restriction on â€œpunitive damagesâ€ in an arbitration clause did not preclude the authorization of treble damages under RICO)).\r\nAddyâ€™s comparison falls short.Â  In fact, the present case requires the Carolina Care Plan analysis to be taken one step further because the arbitration clause at issue here goes beyond banning â€œpunitiveâ€ damages generally and specifically prohibits an arbitrator from awarding statutorily required treble or double damages.Â  Therefore, an arbitratorâ€™s ultimate classification of an award as â€œcompensatoryâ€ or â€œpunitiveâ€ is no longer relevant in an analysis of whether this particular clause is unconscionable:Â  under this arbitration clause, treble and double damages - whether classified as compensatory or punitive - are prohibited outright.Â  \r\nThe general rule is that courts will not enforce a contract which is violative of public policy, statutory law, or provisions of the Constitution.Â \r\nCarolina Care Plan, 361 S.C. at 555, 606 S.E.2d at 758.Â  In our opinion, this rule has two applications in the present case.Â  First, this arbitration clause violates statutory law because it prevents Simpson from receiving the mandatory statutory remedies to which she may be entitled in her underlying SCUTPA and Dealers Act claims.Â  Second, unconditionally permitting the weaker party to waive these statutory remedies pursuant to an adhesion contract runs contrary to the underlying statutesâ€™ very purposes of punishing acts that adversely affect the public interest.[7]Â  Therefore, under the general rule, this provision in the arbitration clause is unenforceable.\r\nAccordingly, we find the provision prohibiting double and treble damages to be oppressive, one-sided, and not geared toward achieving an unbiased decision by a neutral decision-maker.Â  In conjunction with Simpsonâ€™s lack of meaningful choice in agreeing to arbitrate, this provision is an unconscionable waiver of statutory rights, and therefore, unenforceable. \r\n2.&nbsp; Dealerâ€™s remedies not stayed pending outcome of arbitration \r\nAddy argues that the arbitration clauseâ€™s provision reserving certain judicial remedies to the dealer and authorizing the award of the dealerâ€™s remedies even if the consumerâ€™s arbitration proceedings have not concluded is not oppressive and one-sided.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ While stating that â€œall disputes, claims or controversies between Dealer and Customerâ€ are to be settled in binding arbitration, the arbitration clause notes several exceptions.Â  Specifically, the clause provides:\r\n\r\nNothing in this contract shall require the Dealer to submit to arbitration any claims by Dealer against Customer for claim and delivery, repossession, injunctive relief, or monies owed by Consumer in connection with the purchase or lease of any vehicle and any claims by Dealer for these remedies shall not be stayed pending the outcome of arbitration. [emphasis added].\r\n\r\nOur courts have held that lack of mutuality of remedy in an arbitration agreement, on its own, does not make the arbitration agreement unconscionable.Â  See Munoz, 343 S.C. at 542, 542 S.E.2d at 365 (holding that an arbitration agreement between a consumer and a lender was not unconscionable where it allowed the lender to seek foreclosure while requiring the consumer to arbitrate any counterclaim in the foreclosure action); Lackey v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 330 S.C. at 402, 498 S.E.2d at 905 (same).Â  The primary basis for this conclusion in Munoz and Lackey was that requiring one party to seek a remedy through arbitration rather than the judicial system did not deprive that party of a remedy altogether.Â  See Munoz, 343 S.C. at 542, 542 S.E.2d at 365.Â  The Lackey court additionally explained that the judicial remedies which the lender in that case had reserved for itself (i.e. replevin and foreclosure actions) provided specific procedures for protecting the collateral and the parties during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings.Â  Lackey, 330 S.C. at 401, 498 S.E.2d at 905.Â  Because these protections related to both parties and were facilitated by enforcement procedures specified by law, the court of appeals concluded that, regardless of the lack of mutuality of remedy, the arbitration clause bore â€œa reasonable relationship to the business risksâ€ inherent in secured transactions.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nHowever, the essence of Simpsonâ€™s unconscionablity claim is not the general lack of mutuality of remedy, but rather the arbitration agreementâ€™s express stipulation that the dealer may bring a judicial proceeding that completely disregards any pending consumer claims that require arbitration.Â  The clauses at issue in Munoz and Lackey contained no such directives.Â  To this effect, we can easily envision a scenario in which a dealerâ€™s claim and delivery action is initiated in court, completed, and the vehicle sold prior to an arbitratorâ€™s determination of the consumerâ€™s rights in the same vehicle.Â  As the arbitration agreement between Simpson and Addy is written, the dealer collects on a judgment awarded in a judicial proceeding regardless of any protections for the collateral afforded by law. \r\nAddyâ€™s suggestion that there are procedural motions[8] available to the consumer which offset any potentially inconsistent effects of this provision, in our opinion, shows an informal acknowledgement on the part of Addy that such a provision on its face is indeed one-sided.Â  These procedural mechanisms only act to place an additional burden on the consumer to ensure that the vehicle in controversy is not disposed of in a court proceeding initiated by the dealer before the adjudication of the consumerâ€™s claims in arbitration.Â  \r\nWe continue to abide by our previous holdings in Munoz and Lackey that lack of mutuality of remedy will not invalidate an arbitration agreement.Â  However, we find that the provision in the arbitration clause dictating that the dealerâ€™s judicial remedies supersede the consumerâ€™s arbitral remedies is one-sided and oppressive and does not promote a neutral and unbiased arbitral forum.Â  Â Accordingly, in light of Simpsonâ€™s lack of meaningful choice in agreeing to arbitrate, the provision is unconscionable and unenforceable.\r\n3.&nbsp; Limitation on bringing warranty claims in a judicial forum \r\nAddy argues that Simpson may not attack the arbitration clause on the grounds that it violates the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA), 15 U.S.C.A Â§ 2301 et seq. (1997), because Simpsonâ€™s underlying claims alleged no violation of the MMWA.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe arbitration clause in the contract between Simpson and Addy states that it applies to â€œany and all disputesâ€ including â€œautomobile warrantyâ€ and â€œany consumer protection statuteâ€ - all of which implicate the MMWA.Â  The provision further specifies that such matters are to be resolved only by â€œbinding arbitration.â€ \r\nRules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) state that informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in written warranties under the MMWA are not to be legally binding on any person.Â  16 C.F.R. Â§ 703.5(j) (2006).Â Â  See also Richardson v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., 254 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir. 2001).Â  Moreover, the MMWA has been interpreted to supersede the FAA with respect to consumer claims for breach of written warranty.Â  See Boyd v. Homes of Legend, Inc., 981 F. Supp. 1423, 1437-38 (M.D. Ala. 1997).Â  Therefore, the federal government has made it clear that parties may not agree to arbitrate an MMWA claim as the arbitration clause between Simpson and Addy attempted to do here.\r\nThis Court will not enforce a contract which is violative of public policy, statutory law, or provisions of the Constitution.Â \r\nCarolina Care Plan, 361 S.C. at 555, 606 S.E.2d at 758.Â  The fact that Simpson did not bring a claim under the MMWA is irrelevant to our conclusion that the inclusion of the MMWA in the scope of the arbitration clause is unenforceable as a matter of public policy.Â  Accordingly, we hold that this provision of the arbitration clause is an unconscionable and unenforceable violation of public policy.\r\nC. Severability \r\nIn the alternative to its argument that the arbitration clause is not unconscionable, Addy suggests that any provision found by this Court to be unconscionable may be severed from the clause and arbitration allowed to otherwise proceed.Â  In fact, it seems as though the â€œAdditional Terms and Conditionsâ€ section of the contract anticipated just such a scenario.Â  Paragraph fifteen (15) articulates a severability clause providing that:\r\n\r\nIn the event any provision of this contract shall be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired thereby.\r\n\r\nWe disagree.\r\nIn consideration of the federal and state policies favoring arbitration agreements, severability clauses have been used to remove the unenforceable provisions in an arbitration clause while saving the partiesâ€™ overall agreement to arbitrate.Â  See Healthcomp Evaluation Servs. Corp. v. O'Donnell, 817 So. 2d 1095, 1098 (Fla. Ct. App. 2d Dist. 2002)&nbsp;(holding that an arbitration clause was divisible and therefore a severability provision acted to remove the unenforceable provision from the arbitration clause without affecting the intent of the parties); Primerica Fin. Servs. v. Wise, 456 S.E.2d 631, 635 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995) (upholding the trial courtâ€™s application of a severability clause to an arbitration agreement â€œin light of the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements and the partiesâ€™ intentions in entering into those agreementsâ€).Â  Additionally, legislation permits this Court to â€œrefuse to enforceâ€ any unconscionable clause in a contract or to â€œlimit its application so as to avoid an unconscionable result.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-302(1) (2003).Â  \r\nAt the same time, courts have acknowledged that severability is not always an appropriate remedy for an unconscionable provision in an arbitration clause.Â  Although, â€œa critical consideration in assessing severability is giving effect to the intent of the contracting parties,â€ the D.C. Circuit recently cautioned, â€œIf illegality pervades the arbitration agreement such that only a disintegrated fragment would remain after hacking away the unenforceable parts, the judicial effort begins to look more like rewriting the contract than fulfilling the intent of the parties.â€Â  Booker v. Robert Half Intnâ€™l Inc, 413 F.3d 77, 84-85 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).Â  Similarly, the general principle in this State is that it is not the function of the court to rewrite contracts for parties. Â Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 171, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2002).Â  \r\nIn this case, we find the arbitration clause in the adhesion contract between Simpson and Addy wholly unconscionable and unenforceable based on the cumulative effect of a number of oppressive and one-sided provisions contained within the entire clause.Â  While this Court does not ignore South Carolinaâ€™s policy favoring arbitration, we hold that the intent of the parties is best achieved by severing the arbitration clause in its entirety rather than â€œrewritingâ€ the contract by severing multiple unenforceable provisions.[9]Â  \r\nAdditionally, we note that there is no specific set of factual circumstances establishing the line which must be crossed when evaluating an arbitration clause for unconscionability.Â  Therefore, in holding today that the arbitration clause in the vehicle trade-in contract between Addy and Simpson is unconscionable due to a multitude of one-sided terms, we do not overrule our decision in Munoz where we held that an adhesion contract between a consumer and a lender was not unconscionable because it lacked mutuality of remedy.Â  Instead, we emphasize the importance of a case-by-case analysis in order to address the unique circumstances inherent in the various types of consumer transactions. \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion to compel arbitration.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Presentation of evidence to determine unconscionability \r\nAddy argues that the trial court erred in failing to provide Addy a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the commercial setting, purpose, and effect of the arbitration clause in order to aid the court in making a determination on unconscionability.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-302(2) (2003) provides:\r\n\r\nWhen it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.\r\n\r\nSimpson filed her memorandum in opposition to Addyâ€™s motion alleging the unconscionability of the arbitration clause on March 16.Â  After a motion hearing that same day, the trial court ordered mediation.Â  When mediation failed, the court ordered Addy to submit a memorandum in support of its motion, which it did on July 13.Â  The court considered the arguments in both memoranda before issuing its order on August 12.Â  \r\nIn our opinion, the four months that passed between Simpsonâ€™s memorandum and Addyâ€™s response was a â€œreasonable opportunityâ€ for Addy to consider Simpsonâ€™s arguments and respond with respect to the commercial setting, purpose, and effect of the arbitration clause.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s consideration of the partiesâ€™ memoranda without a hearing did not deny Addy a reasonable opportunity to present its evidence in order to aid the courtâ€™s determination.Â Â Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the arbitration clause between Simpson and Addy unconscionable and unenforceable in its entirety.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Addyâ€™s motion to stay litigation pending arbitration.Â  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1 et. seq. (1999) codifies federal policy on arbitration and arbitration agreements.Â  Unless the parties have contracted otherwise, the FAA applies in federal and state courts to any arbitration agreement regarding a transaction that involves interstate commerce, regardless of whether the parties contemplated an interstate transaction.Â  Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 538, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363 (2001).Â  Although the vehicle trade-in contract at issue in the instant case involves interstate commerce, the contract contains a choice of law provision designating South Carolina law as governing law.Â  Therefore, the UAA governs where, as here, the validity of the choice of law provision is not in issue.Â  Additionally, FAA pre-emption of the UAA is not an issue in this case because the state laws applicable to this case do not operate to completely invalidate the partiesâ€™ agreement to arbitrate.Â  See Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 592, 553 S.E.2d 110, 116 (2001). \r\nThis distinction is insignificant in the instant case because the UAA and FAA provisions that apply to the issues are nearly identical.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10(a) (2005) and 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2 (1999). Therefore, the analysis under state law is ultimately the same as the analysis under federal law.Â  Moreover, even in cases where the FAA otherwise applies, general contract principles of state law apply in a courtâ€™s evaluation of the enforceability of an arbitration clause.Â  Munoz, 343 S.C. at 539, 542 S.E.2d at 364.\r\n[2] See Munoz, 343 S.C. at 541, 542 S.E.2d at 365 (â€œ[A] person who can read is bound to read an agreement before signing it.â€); Towles, 338 S.C. at 39, 524 S.E.2d at 845 (â€œ[T]he law does not impose a duty to explain a documentâ€™s contents to an individual when the individual can learn the contents simply from reading the document.â€).\r\n[3] Specifically, the arbitration clause prohibited an arbitrator from awarding double or treble damages.Â  \r\n[4] This included phrases in the â€œDisclaimer of Warrantiesâ€ provision and the â€œUsed Vehicle Disclosure.â€Â  We note that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-316 (2003) requires disclaimers of implied warranties to be â€œconspicuous.â€\r\n[5]  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (1976) (providing that a â€œcourt shall award three times the actual damages sustained and may provide such other relief as it deems necessary or properâ€ [emphasis added]).Â  \r\n[6] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-110(1) (2006) (providing that an individual â€œshall recover double the actual damages by him sustainedâ€ [emphasis added]).Â  \r\n[7] This Court has previously recognized the strong public policy notions behind the enactment of the SCUPTA and the Dealers Act.Â  See deBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 263, 536 S.E.2d 399, 404 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œIt is&nbsp;a violation of the Dealers Act for any manufacturer or motor vehicle dealer â€˜to engage in any action which is arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable and which causes damage to any of the parties or to the public.â€™â€(citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§56-15-40(1) (1991))); Young v. Century Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., 302 S.C. 320, 326, 396 S.E.2d 105, 108 (Ct. App. 1989) (defining an unfair trade practice as a practice which is â€œoffensive to public policy or which is immoral, unethical, or oppressiveâ€), affâ€™d in part, revâ€™d in part, on other grounds, 309 S.C. 263, 422 S.E.2d 103 (1992) (per curiam). The Dealers Act also specifically provides that â€œany contract or part thereof or practice thereunder in violation of any provision of this chapter shall be deemed against public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-15-130 (2006).Â  \r\n[8] Specifically, Addy suggests that a motion for protective order or a motion to stay pending arbitration.\r\n[9] We acknowledge that in light of the state and federal policies favoring arbitration, many courts view severing the offending provision and otherwise proceeding with arbitration to be the preferred remedy for an unconscionable provision in an arbitration clause.Â  However, we find the present case is distinguishable from those cases prescribing severability such that the invalidation of the arbitration clause in its entirety is the more appropriate remedy.Â  \r\nFirst, the arbitration clause in the contract between Simpson and Addy contained a total of three unconscionable provisions while arbitration clauses examined by courts prescribing severability generally contained only one offending provision.Â  See Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2006) (severing a provision in an arbitration clause that prohibited the award of treble damages); Safranek v. Copart, Inc., 379 F. Supp. 2d 927 (D. Ill. 2005) (severing a provision in an arbitration clause that violated Title VII by requiring each party to bear its own attorneyâ€™s fees and costs); Ex parte Celtic Life Ins. Co., 834 So. 2d 766 (Ala. 2002) (severing a provision in an arbitration clause that was void as a violation of public policy by prohibiting the award of punitive damages); Healthcomp Evaluation Servs. Corp., 817 So. 2d 1095 (severing a provision in an arbitration clause that violated state law by not permitting the parties to appeal or review an arbitration award).Â  But see Primerica Fin. Servs. v. Wise, 456 S.E.2d 631 (severing two provisions governing the eligibility of arbitrators and the judicial review of an arbitration).Â  Second, two of the provisions in this case were found unconscionable because the provisions contravened state and federal consumer protection law. The sheer magnitude of unconscionability present in a provision that prevents a party from vindicating the partyâ€™s statutory rights, along with the fact that such a grossly unconscionable provision occurred not once, but twice, requires that we give significant consideration to a remedy in this situation that best serves the interests of public policy.Â  See Graham Oil Co. v. ARCO Prods. Co., 43 F.3d 1244, 1249 (9th Cir. 1994) (noting that severance of illegal provisions is inappropriate when the entire arbitration clause represents an â€œintegrated scheme to contravene public policyâ€ (citations omitted)).\r\nAccordingly, while this Court generally would encourage severability of an unconscionable provision, we do not view the arbitration agreement between Simpson and Addy to be a proper candidate for the application of this remedy.Â  See Ingle v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 328 F.3d 1165, 1180 (9th Cir. 2003); (finding arbitration agreement wholly unenforceable because of an â€œinsidious patternâ€ of unconscionable provisions, and therefore â€œany earnest attempt to ameliorate the unconscionable aspects of [the] arbitration agreement would require [the] court to assume the role of contract author rather than interpreterâ€); In re Cotton Yarn Antitrust Litig., 406 F. Supp. 2d 585, 604&nbsp;(M.D.N.C. 2005) (â€œ[W]here, as here, multiple provisions of the arbitration clauses are inconsistent with Plaintiffsâ€™ ability to effectively vindicate their statutory rights . . ., the Court finds that the better course of action in this case is to excise the arbitration clauses altogether.â€).Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26294","title":"State v.

Benjamin Aplin, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â  These are direct appeals from appellantsâ€™ respective probation revocations.Â  Both cases raise the issue of whether the trial court erred in allowing a non-attorney to present the Stateâ€™s case for revocation.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nState v. Barlow\r\nIn January 2003, appellant Gary Andrew Barlow was convicted of strong arm robbery and sentenced to 15 yearsâ€™ imprisonment, suspended upon the service of three yearsâ€™ imprisonment and two years of probation.Â  He was released from custody in July 2004 and placed on probation.Â  In September 2004, he was permitted, pursuant to the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers, to move to the State of Washington.Â  In 2005, he was arrested in Washington for violating probation and extradited to South Carolina.Â  South Carolina issued an arrest warrant for Barlow based on the probation violations committed in Washington which included, inter alia, submitting an adulterated urine test.Â  \r\nAt the probation revocation hearing, Barlow was represented by counsel; a probation agent appeared on behalf of the State.Â  In addition, a victimâ€™s advocate presented to the court Sherry Hambrick, the victim of the strong arm robbery who made statements regarding Barlowâ€™s crime against her.Â  The victimâ€™s advocate also directly addressed the trial court about the facts of the 2002 robbery.Â  The trial court found Barlow willfully violated probation and revoked three years on his sentence.Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Gibson\r\nIn 2001, appellant Charles David Gibson pled guilty to criminal sexual conduct with a minor, second degree.Â  He was sentenced to 12 yearsâ€™ imprisonment, suspended with probation for five years.Â  In March 2004, Gibson signed a paper which expressly stated he was to have no contact with any minor children.Â  An arrest warrant for Gibson was issued in July 2004 based on several probation violations.Â  Significantly, Gibson was charged with failure to refrain from association with any person the probation agent has instructed him to avoid.Â  This allegation was based on Gibson having his two minor children at his residence on June 19 and 20, 2004.\r\nAt the probation revocation hearing, Gibson was represented by counsel; a probation agent appeared on behalf of the State.Â  The probation agent argued to the trial court that, as a sexual offender in counseling, Gibson should not have put himself in a situation where he was at risk to re-offend.Â  Primarily for that reason, the probation agent recommended that a portion of his suspended sentence be revoked.Â  The trial court found Gibson in violation of his probation and revoked two years of the original 12-year sentence.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by allowing non-lawyers to present the probation revocation cases?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellants both argue the trial court erred because it allowed the State to present the probation revocation case through a non-lawyer, i.e. a probation agent and victimâ€™s advocate for Barlow, and a probation agent for Gibson.Â  We disagree.\r\nBy statute, a probation agent has the power to issue an arrest warrant charging a violation of conditions of supervision, as well as the power of arrest.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-280(B) (2007); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-450 (2007) (the trial court or the probation agent â€œmay issue or cause the issuing of a warrant and cause the defendant to be arrested for violating any of the conditions of probation.â€).Â  A probation agent must report any arrest to the trial court and submit a written report detailing how the probationer has violated his probation.Â  Id. Â§ 24-21-450.Â  The statute outlining the duties and powers of probation agents also specifies that in the performance of a probation agentâ€™s duties, he â€œis regarded as the official representative of the court, the department, and the board.â€Â  Id. Â§ 24-21-280(B) (emphasis added).\r\nWe have noted â€œthere is quite a difference between a criminal prosecution and a probation revocation hearing.â€Â  State v. Franks, 276 S.C. 636, 638, 281 S.E.2d 227, 228&nbsp;(1981).Â  Although the underlying probation violations â€œmay themselves be criminal offenses, the probation revocation proceeding is not a criminal trial of those chargesâ€¦, but a more informal proceeding with respect to notice and proof of the alleged violations.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted); see also U.S. v. Davis, 151 F.3d 1304, 1307&nbsp;(10th Cir. 1998) (â€œProbation revocation proceedings are not criminal proceedingsâ€).Â  Significantly, â€œ[n]o additional punishment is invokedâ€ when the trial court decides to revoke probation.\r\nÂ Franks, 276 S.C. at 638, 281 S.E.2d at 228.\r\nGiven the statutory powers given to probation agents, as well as the fact that a probation revocation hearing is not a formal criminal proceeding, we hold the trial court did not err in allowing the probation agent to â€œpresentâ€ these cases.Â  Clearly the statutes envision a close relationship between the sentencing court and the probation agent when there has been an allegation of probation violation.Â  See Â§Â§ 24-21-280, 24-21-450.Â  Moreover, we find no error in allowing the victimâ€™s advocate to address the trial court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1560 (2003) (victim has the right to attend and comment at post-conviction proceedings affecting probation).\r\nFinally, as to appellantsâ€™ contention that the non-attorneysâ€™ activities in these cases amount to the unauthorized practice of law, we find their comments and/or reports to the trial court do not constitute the practice of law.Â  Cf. Leverette v. State, 546 S.E.2d 63 (Ga. Ct. App. 2001) (where the Georgia Court of Appeals found that a probation officerâ€™s filing of a petition seeking a probation revocation hearing did not constitute the unauthorized practice of law).Â  Both parties cite to In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. 304, 422 S.E.2d 123 (1992), wherein this Court reaffirmed the rule that police officers may prosecute traffic offenses in magistrate and municipal courts.Â  Because a probation revocation proceeding is not a criminal prosecution, however, we find In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules inapposite to the instant cases.Â  \r\nNonetheless, the underlying rationale for allowing a patrolman to act as prosecutor in limited circumstances lends support to why it is also permissible for a probation agent to participate in the probation revocation hearing.Â  In State ex rel. McLeod v. Seaborn, 270 S.C. 696, 244 S.E.2d 317&nbsp;(1978), we stated as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen the officers of the Highway Patrol present misdemeanor traffic violations in the magistratesâ€™ courtsâ€¦, they do so in their official capacities as law enforcement officers and employees of the State.Â  These officers do not hold themselves out to the public as attorneys,\r\nand their activity in the magistratesâ€™ courts does not jeopardize the public by placing â€œincompetent and unlearned individuals in the practice of law.â€...Â  To the contrary, this activity renders an important service to the public by promoting the prompt and efficient administration of justice.\r\n\r\nId. at 698-99, 244 S.E.2d at 319 (citation omitted).Â  Similarly, when a probation agent presents a probation revocation case, the agent is acting in his official capacity and is not holding himself out to the public as an attorney. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-280(B). Â Clearly, the agent â€œrenders an important service to the public by promoting the prompt and efficient administration of justice.â€Â  Seaborn, 270 S.C. at 699, 244 S.E.2d at 319. Â Thus, we reject appellantsâ€™ argument that the non-attorneysâ€™ actions in these cases amounted to the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, appellantsâ€™ respective probation revocations are AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26295","title":"Koon v.

We reverse. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn May 1998, Koon was convicted of grand larceny and second degree burglary.Â  Based upon Koonâ€™s 1986 guilty plea to four counts of second-degree burglary, he was sentenced as a recidivist to LWOP.Â  His direct appeal was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.Â  State v. Koon, Op. No. 2000-UP-291 (Ct. App. April 18, 2000).[1]Â  His first application for PCR was dismissed after a hearing.Â  After Koonâ€™s first PCR hearing, but prior to dismissal of his application, we issued our opinion in State v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 588 S.E. 2d 105 (2003).Â Â  Koon filed a second PCR application asserting that, pursuant to Gordon, his prior second-degree burglary crimes should have been treated as one crime for purposes of sentencing under the recidivist statute.Â Â  The PCR court agreed with Koon and vacated the LWOP sentence.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the PCR court err in holding Koon was improperly sentenced to LWOP based upon his 1986 second-degree burglary convictions?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn State v. Gordon, we addressed the interplay between S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 and Â§ 17-25-50.Â Â  There, we recognized that Â§ 17-25-45 requires defendants who are convicted of three â€œmost seriousâ€ offenses[2] to be sentenced to LWOP, while Â§ 17-25-50 requires that for purposes of sentencing, â€œthe court shall treat as one offense any number of offenses which have been committed at times so closely connected in point of time that they may be considered as one offense, notwithstanding under the law they constitute separate and distinct offenses.â€Â  In Gordon, we overruled prior precedent[3] which had held Â§ 17-25-50 was inapplicable in a â€œthree strikes ruleâ€ analysis and held, instead, that Â§Â§ 17-25-45 and 17-25-50 must be construed together in determining whether crimes committed at points close in time qualify for a recidivist sentence.Â Â Â  \r\nKoon contends that, under Gordon, he should not have been sentenced to LWOP.Â  We disagree.Â Â  Although Gordon stands for the proposition that two offenses committed closely in point of time should be considered as one for purposes of sentencing, Gordon did not establish a bright-line rule as to what constitutes â€œtwo offenses committed so closely in point of time.â€Â  We find the 1986 offenses committed here simply do not fall under Â§ 17-25-50.Â  \r\nThe cases which have found â€œone continuous course of conductâ€ under Â§ 17-25-50 have been cases in which, for example, the defendant had two convictions arising out of a single incident, see State v. Woody, 359 S.C. 1, 596 S.E.2d 907 (2004) (two previous armed robbery convictions stemmed from a single incident but involved two different victims: Woody robbed a convenience store and was convicted of armed robbery of both the storeâ€™s clerk and the store itself); or situations which involve crimes closely connected in point of time, State v. Gordon (where trafficking and conspiracy to traffic crack cocaine occurred within a one week period, the offenses were, although separate and distinct offenses for which Gordon was properly sentenced, â€œso closely connected in point of timeâ€ as to properly be treated as one offense for purposes of recidivist sentencing); or apply to a single, continuous crime spree, State v. Benjamin, 353 S.C. 441, 579 S.E.2d 289 (2003), overruled by State v. Gordon, infra (two armed robberies and murder committed within a four-hour period).Â  \r\nHere, the second-degree burglaries which qualified Koon for sentencing as a recidivist were the March 13, 1986 nighttime burglary of the office of P&amp;G Motors; the March 14, 1986 nighttime burglary of the office or dwelling of Bill Willard; and the March 28, 1986 nighttime burglary of Cudd-Lovelace insurance Company.Â  \r\nWe need not address whether the March 13th and March 14th crimes could or should have been treated as one for purposes of sentencing.Â  We find the March 28th burglary of a different building, in a different location, which occurred two weeks later, clearly constitutes a separate burglary.Â  Accordingly, Koon had, at the very least, two prior serious convictions such that the present conviction constituted his third, and he was therefore properly sentenced as a recidivist.Â  \r\n REVERSED.Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Koon asserted at the Court of Appeals that the offenses were not â€œserious offensesâ€ which triggered the recidivist statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (C)(2)(b).Â  The Court of Appeals found three of the four offenses were â€œserious offenses.â€Â  In 2004, this Court vacated one of the four convictions, finding the indictment alleged only third-degree burglary, such that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to accept the plea to second-degree burglary.Â  Koon v. State, 358 S.C. 359, 595 S.E.2d 456 (2004).Â  However, our holding in Koon I has been overruled by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  The PCR court did not consider the conviction which was vacated by this Court in Koon I.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Â Second-degree burglary under S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312 (b) falls into this category.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(2).Â  \r\n[3]Â  State v.

Elliott, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Robert L. Brown, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Petitioner was charged with numerous counts of burglary and grand larceny in connection with a string of at least seventy-five burglaries in Richland and Kershaw Counties.[1]Â  He was identified as a suspect in the burglaries after an individual observed him throw a lockbox from the window of his car.Â  The lockbox had been stolen from a home the same day.Â  Petitioner pled guilty to three counts of second-degree burglary and two counts of grand larceny.Â  He was sentenced to an aggregate term of forty-five yearsâ€™ imprisonment for the burglaries and concurrent five year terms for the grand larcenies.Â  Defense counselâ€™s motion to reconsider the sentence was denied.Â  No direct appeal was filed.Â  Subsequently, petitionerâ€™s application for post-conviction relief (PCR) was denied.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt the PCR hearing, petitioner testified he met with two members of the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department, and two assistant solicitors of the Richland County Solicitorâ€™s Office shortly after his arrest.Â  Petitioner testified that, at the meeting, they offered petitioner a fifteen-year cap on the sentence if he would cooperate and tell them what burglaries he was involved in and help them retrieve stolen property and have it returned to the rightful owners.Â  Petitioner stated that, after the meeting, he met with one of the assistant solicitors alone because he believed she would tell him the truth about the deal.Â  Petitioner testified he asked her how much jail time he would receive if he accepted the deal, and was told it would be five to seven years.Â  Petitioner testified he met with members of the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department the next day and told them he would accept the deal.Â  That day, the officers drove petitioner around and he showed them twelve to fifteen homes he had burglarized or attempted to burglarize.\r\nPetitioner testified he was worried the plea agreement was not in writing and, during the time he was cooperating, he asked police officers about providing him with a written agreement.Â  Petitioner testified police told him the solicitorâ€™s office did not want to put the offer in writing.Â  However, petitioner testified he felt he was already obligated to help them, and one of the officers told him a written agreement was â€œâ€˜just more of a technical thing.Â  [The solicitorâ€™s office will] honor the deal as long as youâ€™ll do what you said you were going to do.â€™â€Â  During this time, petitioner was acting without benefit of counsel.\r\nPetitioner testified that, after counsel was appointed, he told her about the agreement and that he wanted the State to honor the fifteen-year cap.Â  Petitioner claimed he continuously requested that counsel attempt to enforce the original agreement, but she advised him he had no right to enforce it.Â  Petitioner testified he did not know he was entitled to have his original plea agreement enforced, and, at the time of the plea, he did not realize the plea agreement was binding on the State.Â  He testified he felt that if he did not plead guilty, then he was going to receive a life sentence.Â  However, he stated he would not have pled had he realized he had a binding plea agreement.Â  Petitioner testified he did not want a new trial, but rather, he wanted the deal the State had promised him.\r\nCounsel testified she was not appointed until after petitioner had cooperated with the police and the solicitorâ€™s office.Â  She testified she met with the two assistant solicitors, one of the investigators, and the sheriff, who all confirmed a meeting had occurred between petitioner, the sheriffâ€™s office, and the solicitorâ€™s office, wherein petitioner was told that, if he agreed to cooperate and return items he had stolen, â€œthe charges would be limited to nonviolent burglary second charges, and there would be a cap of a fifteen-year sentence, and everything would run concurrent.â€Â  Counsel testified that either immediately before or after she began representing petitioner, the Solicitor decided not to honor the agreement.Â  She noted the Solicitor had not been at the meeting between petitioner and his two assistant solicitors.\r\nCounsel further testified that, when petitioner pled guilty, she did not believe he had the ability to force the State to honor the original plea agreement.Â  Counsel testified she was unaware of the existence of Reed v. Becka, 333 S.C. 676, 511 S.E.2d 396 (Ct. App. 1999), when she represented petitioner.Â  She stated, at the time she represented petitioner, she believed the only remedy would be to vacate the plea and proceed to trial.Â  She testified that, had she been aware of Reed, she would have raised it to the solicitor and the plea judge.\r\nThe PCR court ruled counsel was not deficient and that there was no agreement whereby petitioner would receive a cap of fifteen years in exchange for his cooperation.Â  The PCR court found the record accurately reflected all plea negotiations, and petitioner had a full understanding of the consequences of his plea and the charges against him.Â  The court further noted there was no testimony from the sheriffâ€™s office or the solicitorâ€™s office concerning this issue.Â  Therefore, the PCR court denied relief.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err by finding defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to attempt to specifically enforce his plea agreement?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe burden is on the applicant in a post-conviction proceeding to prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1094 (1986).Â  To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove:Â  (1) that counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any\r\nevidence of probative value sufficient to support them.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).\r\nThe State argues and the PCR court found that a plea agreement between petitioner and the solicitorâ€™s office did not exist.Â  The PCR courtâ€™s finding is without any evidence of probative value sufficient to support a finding that a plea agreement did not exist.Â  See Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996) (Court will not uphold PCR courtâ€™s findings when there is no probative evidence to support them).Â  Both petitioner and his plea counsel testified regarding the existence of the agreement.Â  Plea counsel specifically stated she met with the assistant solicitors and they confirmed that petitioner was told that if he agreed to cooperate and return items that he had stolen; there would be a fifteen-year cap on his sentence.Â  The only evidence presented was that an agreement in fact existed.Â  Therefore, the PCR court erred by finding a plea agreement did not exist.Â  Cf. Jackson v. State, 342 S.C. 95, 535 S.E.2d 926 (2000) (where there is no evidence contradicting or conflicting with petitionerâ€™s testimony, PCR court erred by finding petitionerâ€™s testimony on the issue was not credible).\r\nPetitioner argues that plea counsel was ineffective for failing to seek specific performance of the original plea agreement.Â  Petitionerâ€™s argument is based on the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Reed v. Becka, 333 S.C. 676, 511 S.E.2d 396 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In Reed, the solicitor made an oral offer, which Becka accepted, to allow Becka to plead to a lesser offense with a recommendation of probation.Â  However, after the State consulted with the victimâ€™s family, the State withdrew the plea offer.Â  The trial judge found the offer was a valid and enforceable contract and denied the Stateâ€™s motion to withdraw the offer.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed.\r\nThe Reed court stated that a defendant does not have a constitutional right to plea bargain, a trial judge is not required to accept a plea bargain, and that ordinarily a plea offer is nothing more than an offer until it is accepted by the defendant by entering a court-approved plea of guilty.Â  However, the Reed court found the general rule is subject to a detrimental reliance exception.\r\nThis exception is stated as:Â  Absent an actual plea of guilty, a defendant may enforce an oral plea agreement only upon a showing of detrimental reliance on a prosecutorial promise in plea bargaining.Â  Reed, 333 S.C. at 688, 511 S.E.2d at 402; see also State v. Peake, 345 S.C. 72, 545 S.E.2d 840 (Ct. App. 2001)[2] (enforcement of an agreement not to prosecute is subject to two conditions:Â  (1) the agent must be authorized to make the promise; and (2) the defendant must rely to his detriment on the promise).Â  Even if the agreement has not been finalized by the court, a defendantâ€™s detrimental reliance on a prosecutorial promise in plea bargaining may make a plea agreement binding.[3]Â  Reed, 333 S.C. at 688, 511 S.E.2d at 402-403.Â  For example, a defendant who provides beneficial information to law enforcement can be said to have relied to his detriment.Â  Id. at 689, 511 S.E.2d at 403.Â  The Reed court adopted the rule that the State may withdraw a plea bargain offer before a defendant pleads guilty, provided the defendant has not detrimentally relied on the offer.\r\nThe Court of Appeals properly adopted the detrimental reliance exception.[4]Â  The State may withdraw from a plea bargain arrangement at any time prior to, but not after, the actual entry of the guilty plea by defendant or any other change of position by\r\nhim constituting detrimental reliance upon the arrangement.Â  Detrimental reliance may be demonstrated where the defendant performed some part of the bargain; for example, where the defendant provides beneficial information to law enforcement.\r\nWe find the exception applies to petitionerâ€™s situation.Â  In reliance on an agreement offering him a fifteen-year cap, petitioner fully cooperated with law enforcement by informing them of a multitude of burglaries he committed and assisting in the return of over a half million dollars in stolen property.Â  Certainly, helping law enforcement solve several burglary crimes and assisting in the return of stolen property is beneficial information.[5]Â  See Reed, supra (defendant who provides beneficial information to law enforcement can be said to have relied to his detriment).Â  Petitioner relied on the plea offer to his detriment by taking the substantial step of cooperating with law enforcement, i.e. by performing some part of the bargain, before the Solicitor withdrew the plea offer.[6]Â  Accordingly, petitioner could have enforced the oral plea agreement.\r\nPetitioner claims counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not having his plea agreement enforced.Â  To prove counsel ineffective when a guilty plea is challenged, petitioner must show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability a guilty plea would not have been entered.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985); Jordan v. State, 297 S.C. 52, 374 S.E.2d 683 (1988).Â  A defendant who pleads guilty upon the advice of counsel may attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea only by showing the advice he received from counsel was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998).\r\nBecause petitioner could have enforced the plea agreement under the detrimental reliance exception and counsel failed to take this action, counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance.Â  Accordingly, counsel was ineffective in failing to have the plea agreement enforced based on the detrimental reliance exception.Â  Cf. Jordan v. State, 297 S.C. 52, 374 S.E.2d 683 (1988) (counselâ€™s conduct fell below professional norms for not protecting Jordanâ€™s right to enforce the plea agreement, which had not been withdrawn, with the solicitorâ€™s office).\r\nFurther, counselâ€™s defective performance prejudiced petitioner.Â  Petitioner testified he felt as if he had to plead, even though the agreement had been withdrawn, because if he did not, then he would receive a life sentence if he went to trial.Â  He stated he would not have pled had he realized he had a binding plea agreement.Â  Accordingly, petitioner was prejudiced by counselâ€™s failure to have the plea agreement enforced.\r\nThe appropriate remedy is the specific performance of the plea agreement.Â  See State v. Sprouse, 355 S.C. 335, 585 S.E.2d 278 (2003) (specific performance of plea agreement is most efficient option because it eliminated need for new trial or plea hearings and granted parties nothing more and nothing less than the benefit for which they had bargained); Jordan v. State, supra (counsel ineffective for failing to withdraw guilty plea once prosecution reneged on plea bargain; remanded for either specific performance of the plea agreement and resentencing or for a new trial).Â  Accordingly, on remand, the solicitorâ€™s office cannot assert anything other than the promised plea agreement of a fifteen-year cap on petitionerâ€™s sentence.\r\nBecause we reverse the PCR court and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion, it is unnecessary to address petitionerâ€™s remaining argument. Â See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Petitioner waived venue and pled guilty to the Kershaw burglaries in Richland County.\r\n[2]Affâ€™d, State v. Peake, 353 S.C. 499, 579 S.E.2d 297 (2003). \r\n[3]In State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 440 S.E.2d 341 (1994), we held that all plea agreements must be on the record and must recite the scope, offenses, and individuals involved in the agreement.Â  Id.Â  Further, we noted that our review of a plea agreement is limited to those terms that are fully set forth in the record.Â  Id.Â  We concluded that neither the State nor the defendant will be able to enforce plea agreement terms which do not appear on the record before the trial judge who accepts the plea.Â  Id.; see also State v. Sprouse, 355 S.C. 335, 585 S.E.2d 278 (2003) (review of an oral plea agreement is limited to terms set forth in the record).Â  The Thrift decision, however, is not directly on point because, in the instant case, we have a plea agreement that was withdrawn by the solicitor.Â  The fact the agreement was oral does not prevent the possible enforcement of the agreement.\r\n[4]See Annotation, Right of Prosecutor to Withdraw from Plea Bargain Prior to Entry of Plea, 16 A.L.R.4th 1089, Â§ 3(a) (1982) (noting at least twenty-four states have adopted the detrimental reliance exception); 5 Wayne R. LaFave, et. al, Criminal Procedure Â§ 21.2(f)Â  (2d. ed. 1999) (prevailing doctrine is that the State may withdraw from a plea bargain agreement at any time prior to, but not after, the actual entry of the guilty plea by the defendant or other action by him constituting detrimental reliance upon the agreement).\r\n[5]Cf.

The subcommittee has also proposed amendments to   the provisions of the rule addressing attorneys admitted in another state, and   law clerks and staff attorneys, to reflect the changes in the number of trial   experiences required and, in the provision addressing attorneys admitted in   another state, to clarify the manner in which proof of equivalent experience may   be provided. Finally, the subcommittee has proposed a new provision addressing   Judge Advocates.\r\nPursuant to Article V, &sect; 4, of the South Carolina Constitution,   we hereby amend Rule 403, SCACR, as proposed by the Rule 403 Subcommittee of the   Chief Justice&rsquo;s Commission on the Profession. These amendments shall be   effective immediately. All civil jury trial, criminal jury trial and family   court trial experiences completed under the rule before the date it was amended   will be credited as the equivalent, i.e., a civil jury trial, criminal jury   trial or family court trial experience, under the rule as amended; however, all   trial experiences completed on or after the date of this order must comply with   the rule as amended. The amended   rule is attached.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.
