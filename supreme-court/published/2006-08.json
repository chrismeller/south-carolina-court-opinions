Reese, 359 S.C. 260, 597 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Chief Judge Hearn filed a dissenting opinion.Â  We granted petitions for writs of certiorari filed by the State and Willie Earl Reese to review the decision of the Court of Appeals reversing Reeseâ€™s conviction for murder.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nWillie Earl Reese and Teresa Reese were married in 1999.Â  In April 2001, Teresa left the marital home and moved in with her parents, Cora and Donald Joyner. Â On April 28, 2001, Teresa and her cousin Edith played in a softball game and, afterwards, went to a bar with other team members.Â  While Teresa was away, Reese called her parentsâ€™ house three or four times looking for Teresa.Â  Reese also drove around the neighborhood for several hours while Teresa was out and finally parked at the end of the street where Teresaâ€™s parents lived.Â  Phone records indicated that, between 9:45 p.m. and 2 a.m., Reese called Teresaâ€™s cell phone fifty-one times.\r\nTeresa and Edith left the bar at approximately 1:30 a.m., with Edith following Teresa home.Â  When they arrived at the neighborhood where Teresa was living with her parents, Edith noticed Reese stopped at a stop sign in front of the street where Teresaâ€™s parents lived, sitting in his car.Â  Teresa stopped and spoke briefly to Reese, then drove to her parentsâ€™ home.Â  Edith and Reese followed Teresa home.Â  When Edith got out of her car to determine whether Teresa was all right, she noticed Reese exiting his car and walking calmly towards Teresa.Â  Edith saw Teresa and Reese standing on the sidewalk talking as she drove to her home, two houses away.Â  When Edith entered her house, she called Teresa.Â  While dialing the number, she heard Reeseâ€™s car drive away.Â  Edith spoke to Cora, who went to check on Teresa.Â  When Cora saw Teresa lying on the sidewalk, she began to scream.Â  Edith returned to Coraâ€™s house and saw Teresa lying on the sidewalk with her eyes wide open and blood running down the side of her ear.\r\nLater on the morning of April 29, 2001, Reese turned himself in to police.Â  He took police to his parentsâ€™ home, where he had hidden the gun with which he shot Teresa, and to his auntâ€™s home, where he left his car.Â  In his statement to police, Reese admitted shooting Teresa.Â  However, he stated that he did not go to her house to kill her.Â  According to Reese, he was upset and crying while talking to Teresa.Â  He pulled the gun out and told Teresa he was going to kill himself.Â  When Teresa tried to talk him out of killing himself, Reese was â€œmoving the gun back and forth as a reaction.â€Â  Reese stated he did not know why the gun went off because he thought both of the gunâ€™s safeties were on.Â  The evidence showed the gunshot wound which killed Teresa was from the gun being either very close to, or in contact with, Teresaâ€™s head.Â  \r\nThe trial judge charged the jury on murder and denied Reeseâ€™s requests for charges on involuntary manslaughter and accident.Â  The jury found Reese guilty of murder.\r\nTHE STATEâ€™S ISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding Reese was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding a mistrial should have been granted based on the solicitorâ€™s closing argument?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nInvoluntary Manslaughter\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding Reese was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction.Â  We agree.\r\nIf there is any evidence warranting a charge on involuntary manslaughter, then the charge must be given. Â State v. Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 605 S.E.2d 522 (2004); State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999).Â  Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another without malice and unintentionally while engaged\r\nin either: (1) an unlawful act not amounting to a felony and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) a lawful act with reckless disregard for the safety of others.Â  State v. Cabrera-Pena, supra;\r\nState v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996).\r\nIt is a felony for a person to present or point at another person a loaded or unloaded firearm.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410 (2003).Â  Suicide is an unlawful act. Â State v. Levelle, 34 S.C. 120, 13 S.E. 319 (1891), overruled on other grounds,\r\nState v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nReese argues that the jury could have found he was not pointing or presenting a firearm or in the process of committing suicide, but was merely threatening to commit suicide, which is not an unlawful act. \r\nAlthough the jury could have found Reeseâ€™s statement that he was moving the gun back and forth did not constitute pointing a firearm, and threatening suicide has not been classified as an unlawful act, there is no doubt that Reese was presenting a firearm when he took the gun out and began waiving it around. Therefore, Reese was pointing or presenting a firearm, a felony, which would preclude an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in holding Reese was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction.\r\nClosing Argument\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding Reese was entitled to a new trial based on the solicitorâ€™s closing argument.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn his closing argument, the solicitor asked the jury, \r\n\r\nWho speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  In this system of justice that we have in this type of case, who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  That is the question that has been asked since April the 29th . . . of this year, since the day she died. Â From the time that Willie Earl Reese was arrested, the time that he initially appeared in court, through the Grand Jury proceedings, when he was placed on the trial docket, when his case was called on Monday, when you jurors with your fellow jurors assembled downstairs before Judge Manning, during the process of you being selected for this case, from opening statements of Ms. Campbell and Mr. Swerling through the presentation of the testimony and the submission of evidence, through the closing remarks of Ms. Campbell and Mr. Swerling and as I stand before you, Madam Forelady and Ladies and Gentlemen, the question is: Who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  And I submit to you that that question can be answered and will be answered today.\r\n\r\nAfter he argued the evidence showed Reese was guilty of murder, the solicitor again asked, â€œWho speaks for Teresa Reese?â€Â  Reese objected to the argument, and the trial judge overruled the objection, stating he would hear counsel on the motion later.Â  The solicitor then continued, â€œSo now I ask you, now that all the evidence is in upon my argument, who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  You do, Madam Forelady and Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury. . . . You do.Â  You speak for her. . . You can speak for her with your verdict. . . . And so you, the State submits, will speak for her with your verdict, with your verdict.â€Â  Again, Reeseâ€™s objection to the argument was overruled. \r\nFollowing the jury charge, Reese was allowed to place on the record his motion concerning the solicitorâ€™s argument.Â  He contended the solicitorâ€™s argument asking the jury to speak for Teresa exceeded the bounds of permissible argument, personalized the issue to the jury, and injected inflammation and passion into the trial.Â  Accordingly, Reese moved for a mistrial.Â  The motion was denied.Â  When Reese later asked the trial judge for a curative instruction concerning the solicitorâ€™s argument, the judge denied the request.\r\nA solicitorâ€™s closing argument must be carefully tailored not to appeal to the personal biases of the jury. Â Von Dohlen v. State, 360 S.C. 598, 602 S.E.2d 738 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 943 (2005).Â  The argument must not be calculated to arouse the jurorsâ€™ passions or prejudices, and its content should stay within the record and reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom. Â Id.Â  \r\nJurors are sworn to be governed by the evidence, and it is their duty to consider the facts of the case impartially.Â  Id.Â  A Golden Rule argument asking the jurors to place themselves in the victimâ€™s shoes tends to completely destroy all sense of impartiality of the jurors, and its effect is to arouse passion and prejudice.Â  Id.\r\nOn appeal, the solicitorâ€™s argument will be reviewed in the context of the entire record. Â State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982).Â  Once the trial judge has allowed the argument to stand, the accused has the burden of proving that the argument denied him a fair determination of guilt or innocence.Â  Id.Â \r\nIn order to constitute reversible error, it must be shown that the argument so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. Â Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168 (1986); Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637 (1974); Von Dohlen v. State, supra.\r\nThe solicitorâ€™s argument indisputably asked jurors to abandon their impartiality and view the evidence\r\nfrom Teresaâ€™s viewpoint.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals correctly held the argument was improper.\r\nThere is no doubt that, after repeatedly trying to get in touch with her, driving around her parentsâ€™ neighborhood, and finally stopping at the entrance to the neighborhood to wait for her return, Reese shot Teresa in the head at very close range while presenting a firearm.Â  However, because the evidence of Reeseâ€™s intent is disputed, the evidence of malice is not overwhelming.Â  \r\nMurder is the killing of any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003).Â  Malice is the wrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved spirit intent on doing wrong. Â State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998).Â  It is the doing of a wrongful act intentionally and without just cause or\r\nexcuse. Tate v. State, 351 S.C. 418, 570 S.E.2d 522 (2002).\r\nAccording to Reese, he did not intend to kill Teresa, but the gun discharged by accident.Â  The only evidence of malice was inferred.Â \r\nSellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182, 607 S.E.2d 82 (2005) (malice may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon);\r\nState v. Watson, 349 S.C. 372, 563 S.E.2d 336 (2002) (malice may be inferred from an act so reckless as to manifest depravity of mind and disregard of human life).Â  Whether Reese had the required malice aforethought for murder was a question for the jury.Â  Therefore, the evidence of Reeseâ€™s guilt was not overwhelming, and the solicitorâ€™s improper Golden Rule argument deprived Reese of a fair trial.\r\nREESEâ€™S ISSUES\r\nBecause we hold a new trial is warranted, it is unnecessary for us to address the issues raised by Reese.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals holding that Reese was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction.Â  However, we hold that Reese was prejudiced by the solicitorâ€™s improper Golden Rule argument since the question of malice was in contention.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision reversing Reeseâ€™s conviction and remanding the case for a new trial.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, J., and Acting Justice Howard P. King, concur.Â  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  I respectfully dissent in part.Â  I agree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion the Court of Appeals erred in finding Reese was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  I also agree the solicitorâ€™s closing argument was improper; however, in my opinion, this error was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence of Reeseâ€™s guilt. \r\nWhen guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached, this Court will not set aside a conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Livingston, 282 S.C. 1, 6, 317 S.E.2d 129, 132 (1984). \r\nIn the testimony developed at trial, Reese admitted he possessed a gun, waved it back and forth, and shot Teresa, but he claimed the gun accidentally discharged.Â  Several witnesses testified Teresa died from a single gunshot wound to the head which was either very close to or directly against her head.Â  Regardless of Reeseâ€™s allegation that he did not have an express intent to kill Teresa, his actions rise to the level of implied malice.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (rev. 2003) (Murder â€œis the killing of any person with malice aforethought, either\r\nexpress or implied.â€); State v. Campbell, 287 S.C. 377, 379, 339 S.E.2d 109, 109 (1985) (â€œThe implication of malice may arise from the use of a deadly weapon.Â  A deadly weapon is generally defined as â€˜any article, instrument or substance which is likely to\r\nproduce death or great bodily harm.â€™â€) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nThe undisputed evidence in this case unequivocally demonstrates Reese killed Teresa while feloniously presenting a firearm.Â  Based on this overwhelming evidence of Reeseâ€™s guilt, I conclude the solicitorâ€™s improper comments during closing argument were harmless beyond any reasonable doubt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26196","title":"Therrell v.

Therrell (Petitioner) tore her right rotator cuff when she fell while working as a waitress at Jerryâ€™s Travel Center.[1]Â  Petitioner sought medical treatment for her injury, eventually undergoing arthroscopic surgery, and ultimately filed for workersâ€™ compensation benefits.\r\nA single commissioner classified Petitionerâ€™s rotator cuff injury as an injury to Petitionerâ€™s â€œright upper extremityâ€ and determined the injury resulted in a loss of twenty percent of Petitionerâ€™s use of her right arm.Â  Accordingly, the commissioner awarded Petitioner a twenty percent recovery under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30(13) (1976) (providing the scheduled recovery for the loss of an arm).Â  Petitioner appealed to the full workersâ€™ compensation commission, arguing that an award under the scheduled loss of an arm provision was improper because her injury was to her shoulder, not her arm.Â  The full commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s decision, but increased Petitionerâ€™s disability rating to thirty percent.\r\nOn appeal, the circuit court focused on the deferential standard of review regarding factual and evidentiary matters in workersâ€™ compensation cases and affirmed the full commissionâ€™s decision.Â  The court emphasized that Petitioner presented the bulk of the evidence of her impairment in terms of the impact of the injury on her ability to use her arm.Â  Similarly, the court of appeals affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s decision; focusing on Petitionerâ€™s description of her injury as affecting her arm and on the fact that the medical evidence in the record rated Petitionerâ€™s injury as an impairment of the â€œright upper extremity.â€Â  Therrell v. Jerryâ€™s Inc., 360 S.C. 314, 318, 600 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThis Court granted certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision, and Petitioner raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina workersâ€™ compensation law, is recovery for a torn rotator cuff limited to the scheduled recovery for the loss of an arm?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review \r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act governs appellate review of the workersâ€™ compensation commissionâ€™s decision.Â  Accordingly, this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  Additionally, this Court may reverse or modify the commissionâ€™s decision if Petitioner has suffered the appropriate degree of prejudice and the commissionâ€™s decision is effected by an error of law or is â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Id.\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\nPetitioner argues that compensation for a torn rotator cuff should not be limited to the scheduled recovery for the loss of an arm.Â  We agree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (2005) sets forth what is commonly referred to as the â€œscheduledâ€ scheme of workersâ€™ compensation recovery.Â  Specifically, the statute details a formula for calculating compensation awards for several types of injuries.Â  Although the scheduled injury statute refers mostly to injuries resulting in the loss of particular members of the body, subsection 42-9-30(18) provides that a fraction of the award allowed for the loss of a member is recoverable for an injury resulting in the loss of use of a member.[2]\r\nThe instant case calls on this Court to interpret this loss of use provision.Â  While Respondents allege the commission properly determined that Petitioner was limited to recovery for the scheduled loss of use of her arm, Petitioner alleges she should instead have received an award under Â§ 42-9-30(20) for the loss of a member, organ, or part of the body not specifically listed in the compensation statutes or regulations.Â  Thus, the question presented is most accurately restated as â€œwhether compensation for a torn rotator cuff is limited to the scheduled recovery for the loss of use of an arm, or whether the injury is instead an unscheduled injury under Â§ 42-9-30(20).â€[3]\r\nThis is a novel issue for this Court.Â  Petitionerâ€™s and Respondentsâ€™ views of this issue essentially represent two competing approaches to scheduled recovery schemes.Â  Under Respondentsâ€™ approach, which we will call the â€œfunctional impairmentâ€ view, the functional impairment that results from an injury is dispositive for determining under what schedule an injury is paid.Â  See Langton v. Rocky Mountain Health Care Corp., 937 P.2d 883, 884 (Colo. Ct. App. 1996).Â  Applied to this case, Petitioner would be due compensation for any scheduled body part that is functionally impaired by her rotator cuff injury.Â  Respondents contend that because Petitioner has only suffered the partial loss of use of her arm, she should recover only a scheduled award under Â§ 42-9-30(13). Â Admittedly, this view is somewhat appealing because part of the goal of workersâ€™ compensation is to alleviate â€œthe loss or impairment of an employeeâ€™s capacity to earn.â€Â  Singleton, 236 S.C. at 470, 114 S.E.2d at 845 (quoting Burnette v. Startex Mills, 195 S.C. 118, 121, 10 S.E. 164, 166 (1940)).Â  Thus, it seems completely reasonable to award compensation for an injury based only on the â€œfunctional impairmentsâ€ it causes.[4]\r\nIn contrast, the â€œsitus of the injuryâ€ approach focuses on the injured body part in determining how the injury is properly compensated.Â  Applied to this case, Petitioner argues that because her injury was to her shoulder and not her arm, a scheduled award for the loss of use of her arm is improper.Â  This approach is most persuasively justified by the argument that in some cases, limiting recovery for some injuries to the member or body part that suffers the functional impairment does not adequately compensate for the actual injury which occurred.[5]\r\nWe hold that South Carolinaâ€™s statutory scheme best complies with the situs of the injury approach, and contrasts sharply with Coloradoâ€™s rigid functional limitation analysis.Â  The Code provides that an injury to any unlisted member, organ, or part of the body may be compensated by determining the ratio that the resulting impairment bears to the â€œwhole person.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30(20) (2005).Â  Far from enunciating a privileged list of scheduled injuries and focusing on the functional limitations caused by an injury, our scheduled recovery scheme specifically provides that the lists of injuries in the Code and in the regulations are not exclusive.Â  Id; 25A S.C. Code Ann.Regs. 67-1101(B) (1976).Â  Instead, the Code requires the commission to convert injuries to unscheduled members into a percentage of impairment to whole person pursuant to either the American Medical Associationâ€™s â€œGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairmentâ€ or â€œany other accepted medical treatise or authority.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann.Regs. 67-1101(B) (1976).Â  Accordingly, South Carolina courts are relieved from performing the complicated calculus involved in translating a rotator cuff injury into a percentage of lost use of the arm and other scheduled members. [6] \r\nAdditionally, the conclusion that our scheduled recovery scheme focuses on the site of the injury in determining the type of proper compensation finds support in this Courtâ€™s case law.Â  In Gilliam v. Woodside Mills, an employer argued that the hip joint was part of the leg, and that the claimant should therefore have been confined to the scheduled recovery for the loss of a leg.Â  319 S.C. at 387, 461 S.E.2d at 819.Â  Disagreeing, this Court held that for workersâ€™ compensation purposes, the hip socket is part of the pelvis and not part of the leg.Â  Id.\r\nUndeniably, Gilliam stands for the proposition that our scheduled compensation scheme focuses on the site of the injury and not the resulting functional limitation. Â Accordingly, we hold that a rotator cuff injury is not properly compensable under the loss of use of an arm schedule.Â  Instead, the proper course in these cases is to proceed pursuant to Â§ 42-9-30(20) and use the AMA Guides or â€œany other accepted medical treatise or authorityâ€ to convert the injury to the rotator cuff into a percentage of impairment to the whole person.[7]\r\nTurning to the instant case, however, we believe Petitioner is procedurally barred from receiving the relief she requests from this Court.Â  Before the single commissioner, Petitioner claimed that her shoulder injury entitled her to a general disability award under Â§ 42-9-10. Â The commissioner disagreed and found Petitioner was precluded from seeking such an award by the inability to show a loss in earning capacity.Â  Before the appellate panel, Petitioner again sought a general disability award, and continued to describe her injury in terms of its effects on her ability to use her arm.\r\nIn order to seek an award under Â§ 42-9-30(20), Petitioner should have introduced evidence supporting this claim at these initial proceedings.Â  In our view, Petitionerâ€™s requested relief is incredibly instructive.Â  Petitioner asks for the case to â€œbe remanded to the workersâ€™ compensation commission for a determination as to the proper ratio for a shoulder injury as it bears to the whole man.â€Â  Petitioner did not present any evidence of the percentage of impairment to her shoulder, and furthermore, as Respondents point out, â€œPetitioner did not introduce any evidence to establish that the shoulder has a higher value in relation to the whole man . . .[i]ndeed, the AMA Guides establish just the opposite . . . .â€Â  \r\nAs this Court has stated, the burden is on the claimant to prove that an injury is compensable within the act.Â  Walker v. City Motor Car Co., 232 S.C. 392, 396, 102 S.E.2d 373, 374 (1958).Â  Though the workersâ€™ compensation commission carries the duty to determine how an injury is compensable, the commission makes this decision based on submitted evidence, not out of thin air.Â  To grant the relief Petitioner seeks, we would need to allow Petitioner to present the commission with evidence not found in the record on appeal; effectively providing Petitioner with a â€œsecond bite at the apple.â€Â  This case does not justify such a significant departure from our rules.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the commissionâ€™s decision is not clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record.Â  The vast majority of the evidence in the record, including Petitionerâ€™s own testimony, describes Petitionerâ€™s injury only in terms of its effects on her ability to use her arm.\r\nWe believe a factor driving much of the confusion on this issue is that the scheduled member statutes speak in a different language from medical service providers and the AMA Guides.Â  While the scheduled member statutes use terms like â€œarmâ€ and â€œleg,â€ the AMA guides classify unscheduled injuries according to their effect on a personâ€™s â€œupper or lower extremities.â€Â  See AMA Guides, 20, 85 (providing tables converting various impairments from the upper and lower extremities to percentages of impairments to the whole person).Â  \r\nThe instant case illustrates how this disconnect can be problematic.Â  We take this opportunity to emphasize the need for the commission to examine the particular injury at issue in every case to determine how a physicianâ€™s or medical service providerâ€™s impairment rating is properly applied; either to a listed schedule, or translated to a percentage of impairment to the whole person pursuant to the AMA Guides.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we modify the court of appealsâ€™ decision, and affirm.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Ernest Kinard, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The rotator cuff is a group of muscles, ligaments, and cartilage attaching the humerus (armbone) to the chest.Â  J. Stanley McQuade, Determining Disability &amp; Personal Injury Damage, Medical Evaluations for Trial Lawyers, 284-85 (1984).Â  The shoulder socket consists of the clavicle (collarbone) and the scapula (shoulder blade).Â  Id. Â Petitioner also injured her left knee in the fall. Â This case, however, does not involve the portion of the award designated for Petitionerâ€™s knee injury.\r\n[2] Sections 42-9-10 and -20 detail the alternative system of recovery, commonly referred to as â€œgeneral disability.â€Â  To seek a general disability award, a claimant who has suffered a scheduled injury must show that the injury affects some other part of his body and has resulted in a loss of earning capacity.Â  Singleton v. Young Lumber Co., 236 S.C. 454, 471, 114 S.E.2d 837, 845 (1960).\r\n[3] Notably, Respondents characterize the commissionâ€™s decision as a â€œfactual determinationâ€ that the Petitionerâ€™s upper extremity impairment applied to her right arm.Â  Thus, Respondents urge this Court to apply the highly deferential standard of review due an administrative agencyâ€™s determinations of that type.Â  We disagree.Â  The question of whether Petitioner sustained an injury would be a question of fact.Â  In contrast, the question of under what subsection a rotator cuff injury is compensable is a question of statutory construction, which this Court reviews de novo.Â  See Gilliam v. Woodside Mills, 319 S.C. 385, 387, 461 S.E.2d 818, 819 (1995) (deciding as a matter of law that a hip socket is not part of the leg for workersâ€™ compensation purposes); Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843, (2005) (holding that determining legislative intent is a question of law); and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (2005).Â  \r\n[4] Interestingly, however, the full quote in Singleton implies that the scheduled recovery scheme is partially focused on compensating the claimant for his or her physical ailments, independent of any loss of functional ability.Â  236 S.C. at 470, 114 S.E.2d at 845 (stating that workersâ€™ compensation is designed to compensate for functional loss and â€œnot to indemnify for any physical ailment or impairment as such, except in the classes of case specifically provided in the Act.â€) (emphasis added).Â  Accordingly, this weighs slightly against applying the functional impairment view to South Carolinaâ€™s scheduled recovery scheme.\r\n[5] Although Petitioner asserts that other jurisdictions â€œunanimouslyâ€ adopt this view, Colorado stands with at least two other jurisdictions in limiting compensation for shoulder injuries to the schedule for the loss of use of an arm.Â  See Hagen v. Labor &amp; Industry Review Commâ€™n, 563 N.W.2d 454, 457-58 (Wis. 1997) (finding Wisconsinâ€™s scheduled member statute ambiguous and deferring to the commissionâ€™s â€œlong-standing viewâ€ that a shoulder injury is measured as a loss of an arm at the shoulder); and Castro v. Gillette Group, Inc., 479 N.W.2d 460, 463 (Neb. 1992) (stating in a conclusory fashion that a shoulder injury whose only residual signs of damage was persistent pain in the arm was an injury to a â€œscheduled memberâ€).Â  In Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Douglas, the Georgia court of appeals initially termed the injury a shoulder injury, but later clarified that the claimant suffered a fracture of the head of the humerus, the upper arm bone.Â  260 S.E.2d 509, 511 (1979).Â  Thus, the injury in Douglas was an arm injury, and the case does not support the functional limitation view.\r\n[6] The regulationsâ€™ specific reference to the â€œAMA Guidesâ€ is particularly instructive.Â  In announcing that its scheme held strongly to the functional limitation view, the Colorado court expressly disregarded the AMA Guides and stated that the resource was â€œirrelevant under the situs of the functional impairment test.â€ Langton, 937 P.2d at 884.Â  (footnote continues)\r\nAcademically, a true application of a functional limitation analysis would not be distinctly different from analyzing an injury under the situs of the injury view.Â  We believe part of the harm courts see in compensating every shoulder injury as merely a scheduled loss for the loss of use of an arm is that some shoulder injuries affect other parts of the body as well.Â  See Bumpus v. Massman Const. Co., 145 S.W.2d 458, 461 (Mo. 1940) (stating that limiting a shoulder injury to the scheduled loss of an arm meant the commission disregarded the injuryâ€™s effects on other portions of the claimantâ€™s body); see also Bray v. Carrothers Const. Co., 293 P. 504, 506 (Kan. 1930) (where one end of a fractured clavicle protruded backwards and into the shoulder muscles, the court held that while the loss of use of the proximate arm may have been sufficient to support an award for the scheduled loss of an arm, the fact that the arm was affected did not justify limiting the award to that schedule).Â  Under a true â€œfunctional limitationâ€ view, the proper approach would be to analyze the limitations caused by the shoulder injury beyond the arm and into the back, neck, and other areas of the body.Â  In awarding compensation based upon an unscheduled injuryâ€™s percentage of impairment to the whole person, Â§ 42-9-30(20) performs exactly this analysis.\r\n[7] Respondents argue that under the AMA Guides, a shoulder injury is to be converted to an injury to the upper extremity.Â  While we agree in part, this argument stops short of what the statute requires.Â  Section 42-9-30(20) clearly provides that otherwise unscheduled injuries are to be converted to a percentage of impairment to the whole person.Â  Additionally, because the AMA Guides describe the â€œupper extremityâ€ as consisting of the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder, translating a shoulder injury into a percentage of â€œupper extremityâ€ impairment would be of no use in determining the proper listed schedule for recovery.Â  See AMA Guides, 13.\r\nIn addition to Gilliam, both parties discuss Roper v. Kimbrellâ€™s of Greenville, 231 S.C. 453, 99 S.E.2d 52 (1957).Â  We find, however, that Roper has little to do with the instant case.Â  In Roper, an employee suffered a separated shoulder, and the commission awarded benefits under the former version of the loss of an arm schedule.Â  Id. at 454-55, 99 S.E.2d at 53-54.Â  Because the employer, and not the claimant, contested the award on appeal, the Court was not forced to consider the claimantâ€™s entitlement to an award for the shoulder injury beyond the scheduled recovery for loss of an arm.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26197","title":"Watson v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Karen C. Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of SouthÂ  Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  The post-conviction relief (â€œPCRâ€) court granted Bobby Watson (â€œWatsonâ€) a new trial, finding that counsel was ineffective for eliciting and failing to object to improper hearsay testimony.Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition to review the PCR judgeâ€™s decision.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nIn 1999, a nine year old child accused Watson of sexual abuse.Â  The victim made the allegation to her grandmother, who subsequently took the victim to a pediatrician.Â  The pediatrician was unable to discover any evidence of abuse.Â  However, a pediatric nurse practitioner, who specializes in conducting such examinations, later examined the victim more extensively. The nurse found that the victimâ€™s condition was consistent with past sexual abuse.\r\nAt trial, the victim testified about several incidents of abuse which occurred between 1997 and 1999.Â  She also identified Watson as the perpetrator.Â  Further, several witnesses testified regarding the victimâ€™s allegations.Â  In addition to identifying the time and place of the abuse, the witnesses recalled the victimâ€™s statements to them regarding the abuse and identified Watson as her abuser.Â Â Â  \r\nWatson was convicted of first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and lewd act upon a child.Â  He was sentenced to concurrent terms of thirty years for criminal sexual conduct with a minor and fifteen years for lewd act upon a child.Â  The court of appeals affirmed Watsonâ€™s convictions and sentences.Â  State v. Watson, 353 S.C. 620, 579 S.E.2d 148 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nWatson filed an application for PCR, alleging that counsel was ineffective in failing to object to improper hearsay testimony.Â  The PCR court found that counselâ€™s only strategic reason for allowing the testimony without objection was that the testimony was â€œmerely cumulative.â€Â  As a result, the PCR court granted Watson relief.Â  The State appeals raising the following issue for review:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err in finding that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the introduction of hearsay testimony?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove: (1) that counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).Â  This Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995)).&nbsp; On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.&nbsp; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).&nbsp;Â  If no probative evidence exists to support the findings, this Court will reverse.&nbsp; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000) (citing Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996)).Â  \r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nThe State contends that the PCR court erred in finding that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the introduction of hearsay testimony.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an out-of-court statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception to the rule applies.â€Â  Dawkins v. State, 346 S.C. 151, 156, 551 S.E.2d 260, 262 (2001) (citing Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17, 20, 443 S.E.2d 566, 568 (1994)).Â  One exception to the rule allows limited corroborative testimony in criminal sexual conduct cases when the victim testifies.Â  Id; Rule 801(d)(1)(D), SCRE. Â Â The corroborative testimony is restricted to the victimâ€™s complaint of the time and place of the sexual assault.Â  Dawkins, 346 S.C. at 156, 551 S.E.2d at 262.Â  Any other details or particulars, including the perpetratorâ€™s identity, must be excluded.Â  Id. at 156, 551 S.E.2d at 263.Â Â  \r\nThis Court has held that the failure to object to improper hearsay testimony in a criminal sexual conduct case because the testimony is merely cumulative to the victimâ€™s testimony is not a reasonable strategy where the evidence is not overwhelming or the improper testimony bolsters the victimâ€™s testimony.Â Â  Dawkins, 346 S.C. at 157, 551 S.E.2d at 263.Â  However, where counsel articulates a valid reason for employing a certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  Stokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546, 419 S.E.2d 778 (1992).Â  \r\nIn this case, several witnesses testified about the abuse allegations against Watson.Â  The victimâ€™s grandmother testified that the victim said, â€œGrandmomma, ah, Buster assaulted me sexually.â€[1]Â  Additionally, a department of social services investigator and two psychologists testified that the victim had identified Watson as her abuser.Â  One of the psychologists also provided detailed statements from the victim regarding the abuse, including statements such as â€œhe stuck his thing in me.â€Â  Portions of the corroborative testimony presented at trial were elicited by Watsonâ€™s trial counsel.Â  At no time did Watsonâ€™s trial counsel object to the admission of the testimony.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, trial counsel testified that she did not object to the hearsay testimony because she wanted to avoid the possibility that the prosecution would have shown the video of the victim talking about the sexual abuse.Â  Counsel stated that, â€œI used my own judgment.Â  Had I objected, then they could have shown the video and shown the child again.Â  And I did not think that was wise, to keep showing that. . . the child telling about the abuse over and over, and over, and the jury seeing the child telling that over and over and over.â€ The PCR court found that Watsonâ€™s trial counsel failed to object to the hearsay testimony because â€œit was merely cumulative of the victimâ€™s testimony.â€Â  \r\nWhile the PCR court correctly found that the testimony was inadmissible hearsay under Rule 801(d)(1)(D), SCRE, the PCR court erred in finding that counselâ€™s strategic reason for failing to object was unreasonable.Â  In its decision, the PCR court mischaracterized trial counselâ€™s testimony at the PCR hearing.Â  Counsel did not fail to object because of the cumulative effect of the corroborative testimony, but instead decided that objections to the corroborative testimony might lead to the more damaging introduction of the victimâ€™s videotape.Â  Accordingly, we hold that counsel articulated a valid reason for failing to object to the hearsay testimony, and the PCR court erred in finding that counsel was ineffective in failing to prevent the introduction of the hearsay testimony.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the above reasons, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision granting Watson a new trial.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion. \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent because, in my opinion, there is probative evidence in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in both failing to object to hearsay, and in eliciting that testimony on cross-examination.Â  E.g.. Smith v. State, Op. No. 26161 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 5, 2006).Â  I would therefore affirm the PCR order granting Respondent a new trial.\r\nThe majority finds that trial counselâ€™s failure to object to the hearsay evidence identifying Respondent as the perpetrator was not ineffective as it was the result of a valid strategic decision.Â  I disagree. Trial counsel apparently believed that if she objected to the hearsay, it might lead to the Stateâ€™s introduction of a video tape in which the victim described the abuse.Â  In fact, part of that tape was played at trial at trial counselâ€™s request, and over the Stateâ€™s objection.Â  Had the State wished, however, it could have sought to introduce the remainder of the tape following counselâ€™s introduction of a portion of the interview.Â  See State v. Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 605 S.E.2d 522 (2004).Â  Further, to the extent trial counsel testified that she did not object to the improper hearsay testimony because counsel feared if she objected to the hearsay they would simply play the tape â€œover and over and over,â€ her fear is grounded in a fundamental misunderstanding of the law.Â  The State was not entitled to introduce the victimâ€™s prior consistent statement unless Respondent charged the victim with a recent fabrication or improper motive or influence.Â  See Rule 801 (d) (1), SCRE.Â  I simply do not understand how objecting to third party hearsay testimony that the victim had identified Respondent as her abuser could have opened the door to permit the State to play the interview tape. \r\nIn my opinion, no valid strategic decision explains trial counselâ€™s failure to object to the hearsay testimony repeating the victimâ€™s identification of Respondent as her abuser.Â  Magazine v. State, 361 S.C. 610, 606 S.E.2d 761 (2004) (counselâ€™s strategy reviewed under â€œan objective standard of reasonableâ€).Â  I would therefore affirm the PCR order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Watson is also known by the nickname â€œBuster.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26199","title":"State v.

Sowell, of Anderson, pro se.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, and State Grand Jury Chief Jennifer D. Evans, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in State v. Sowell, Op. No. 2005-UP-122 (Ct. App. filed Feb. 17, 2005).Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s holding that Sowell was in contempt for releasing grand jury information to his private investigator. Â We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nSowell is an attorney who was hired to represent Bobby Joe Lewis, a criminal defendant who was indicted by the State Grand Jury for trafficking methamphetamine.Â  On March 4, 2002, the circuit court issued a protective order pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720 (Supp. 2004), directing that any State Grand Jury material given to the defendants was being provided only for purposes of their trials, and that their attorneys were bound by the secrecy provisions of Â§ 14-7-1720.[1]Â  \r\nSowell hired a private investigator, Gene Gore, to look into the charges and to investigate how other witnesses would testify.Â  According to Sowell, he had utilized Gore, who also worked as a used car salesman, numerous times in the past as a private investigator.Â  Gore testified that he understood that he was acting as Sowellâ€™s agent, or a paralegal, while conducting his investigations.Â  \r\nSowell gave Gore the Grand Jury file information forwarded to him from the Attorney Generalâ€™s office.Â  At Sowellâ€™s contempt trial, the assistant solicitor questioned Gore as to whether, when Sowell left this information with him, â€œdid he give you any instructions about what to do or anything about grand jury material, anything like that?â€Â  Gore responded negatively.Â  However, when questioned by Sowell as to whether he was warned by Sowell not to discuss the contents of the file with anyone, Gore responded:\r\n\r\nA.Â  The best I can recall, you handed me that box and you said, â€œThese are statements that have been taken from the people in this case.Â  I want you to look through them and go investigate the ones you feel are pertinent to the upcoming case.\r\nQ.Â  And what did I tell you about disclosing the information from that file?\r\nA.Â  No, you told me to keep the box under lock and key at all times.\r\n\r\nSowell also testified he instructed Gore not to disclose the contents of the file or show it to anyone. \r\nLewisâ€™ first Â trafficking trial, in April 2002, ended in a hung jury.Â  During that trial, it became evident the state had information that a man named Floyd Eugene Ballew, Jr., a/k/a Dooney, was supplying drugs to Lewis.Â  It also became evident at the first trial that Lewis and Dooneyâ€™s supplier was a man named â€œKenny,â€ or â€œKC,â€ from Greenville.Â  Subsequent to the first trial, Dooney was added to the indictment as a co-conspirator in the trafficking ring.Â  Dooney was arrested and, prior to Lewisâ€™ second trial, Sowell met with him in the Laurens County jail and took an affidavit and statement from him.Â  From his meeting with Dooney, Sowell concluded Kenneth Curtis was the â€œKennyâ€ or â€œKCâ€ implicated in the first trial.Â  Sowell therefore instructed Gore to talk to Curtis and ascertain the substance of his testimony if called as a witness at the second trial.Â  \r\nKenneth Curtis was called as a witness by the state at the contempt hearing.Â  Curtis testified that he had paid Lewisâ€™ attorney fee to Sowell, and that Sowell allegedly advised Curtis he would let him know if Lewis was â€œgoing to flip on him.â€Â  Curtis testifiedÂ  he was kept advised of the on-going investigation by Gore.Â  On cross-exam by Sowell, however, Curtis testified that he was never told about the contents of the Grand Jury file by Gore.Â  Gore simply advised Curtis that his name was â€œall over the placeâ€ and that police were about to get him.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the contempt hearing, the state asserted that the only basis upon which it was seeking a finding of contempt was that Sowell had released the Grand Jury file to Gore; the state specifically advised the court it was not alleging a contempt violation based upon any disclosure by Gore to Curtis.Â  \r\nThe circuit court found Sowell in criminal contempt of the March 4, 2002 protective order, holding that he was not authorized to release the Grand Jury information to Gore, and that he had not explained the secrecy requirements of the protective order to Gore.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the contempt finding.Â  It found Sowell had failed to inform the court that he had disclosed the Grand Jury information to Gore, and had failed to explain to Gore the obligation of secrecy.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the finding of contempt?Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWillful disobedience of an Order of the Court may result in contempt.Â  Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Social Svcs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 370 S.E.2d 872 (1988).Â  A willful act is defined as one â€œdone voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€Â  Id. at 82-83, 370 S.E.2d at 874, citing Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1434 (5th Ed. 1979).Â  However, â€œ[o]ne may not be convicted of contempt for violating a court order which fails to tell him in definite terms what he must do.â€Â  Welchel v. Boyter, 260 S.C. 418, 421, 196 S.E.2d 496, 498 (1973).Â  In order to sustain a finding of contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to the acts or conduct upon which such finding is based.Â  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1982).Â  In a criminal contempt proceeding, the state has the burden of proving the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Bowers, 270 S.C. 124, 131, 241 S.E.2d 409, 412 (1978).Â  A determination of contempt is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, but is subject to reversal where based on a finding that is without evidentiary support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.Â  Pratt v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Social Svcs., 283 S.C. 550, 324 S.E.2d 97 (Ct.App.1984). \r\nHere, the trial courtâ€™s protective order states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Attorney General is protected if he chooses to disclose to the attorneys for the defendants in the above-captioned cases testimony taken in the State Grand Jury and interviews of witnesses and other documents which must subsequently be disclosed under normal circumstances at trial.Â  It is understood that the State Grand Jury material is being provided only for purposes of the trial of the above-captioned cases.Â  The attorney for the defendants and the defendants are bound by the secrecy provisions of Â§ 14-7-1720.\r\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-7-1700 and -1720(A) (Law. Co-op. 1976), the defendants and their attorneys are prohibited from photocopying any State Grand Jury testimony, interviews of witnesses and any other documents that may be disclosed to the defendants and their attorneys in reference to the above-captioned case.Â  All such materials shall be completely destroyed at the conclusion of the case.Â  \r\nNothing in this Order prohibits the defendants or their attorneys from using Brady material for purposes of preparing for trial.\r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-7-1700, a defendant has the right to review and reproduce grand jury materials.Â  This section also requires the Attorney General, subject to the limitations of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720 (A) and (D), to provide the defendant a copy of the transcript of the recorded testimony or proceedings.Â  Subsection 14-7-1720 (A) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\r\nA state grand juror, the Attorney General or his designee, any interpreter used, the court reporter, and any person to whom disclosure is made pursuant to subsection (B) (2) of this section may not disclose the testimony of a witness examined before a state grand jury or other evidence received by it except when directed by a court for [certain purposes]. . .\r\n\r\nSubsection (B) (2) provides:\r\n\r\n(B) In addition, disclosure of testimony of a witness examined before a state grand jury or other evidence received by it may be made without being directed by a court to: \r\n(1) the Attorney General or his designee for use in the performance of their duties; and \r\n(2) those governmental personnel, including personnel of the State or its political subdivisions, as are considered necessary by the Attorney General or his designee to assist in the performance of their duties to enforce the criminal laws of the State; provided that any person to whom matters are disclosed under this item (2) shall not utilize that state grand jury material for purposes other than assisting the Attorney General or his designee in the performance of their duties to enforce the criminal laws of the State. The Attorney General or his designee promptly shall provide the presiding judge before whom was impaneled the state grand jury whose material has been disclosed, the names of the persons to whom the disclosure has been made, and shall certify that he has advised these persons of their obligation of secrecy under this section. \r\n\r\nBy its terms, subsection A applies only to the Attorney General or his designees, or to those whom disclosure is made pursuant to Subsection B.Â  Subsection B is inapplicable here, as it likewise pertains to the Attorney General, and governmental personnel acting in the performance of their duties.Â  We find no basis to hold Sowell in criminal contempt for willful violation of a statute which, on its face, does not apply to him.Â  Welchel v. Boyter (party may not be convicted of contempt for violating a court order which fails to tell him in definite terms what he must do).Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of contempt based in part upon the emphasized language of Â§ 14-7-1720(B) (2), requiring the Attorney General or his designee to give notice to the circuit court if grand jury information was disclosed.Â  The Court of Appeals cited the mandatory language of section 14-7-1720(B) (2), as follows: \r\n\r\nThe Attorney General or his designee promptly shall provide the presiding judge before whom was impaneled the state grand jury whose material has been disclosed, the names of the persons to whom the disclosure has been made, and shall certify that he has advised these persons of their obligation of secrecy under this section.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals went on to note there was evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s rulings inasmuch as Sowell failed to inform the court that he disclosed the grand jury material to Gore.Â  However, Sowellâ€™s failure to advise the trial court of disclosure was not the basis of the trial courtâ€™s finding of contempt.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in utilizing this as a basis for affirming the contempt finding.Â  Connolly v. Peopleâ€™s Life Ins. Co. of South Carolina, 299 S.C. 348, 384 S.E.2d 738 (1989) (Court of Appeals may not decide an issue neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial judge).Â  \r\nFurther, the Court of Appeals affirmed the contempt finding based on the fact that Curtis testified he was kept apprised by Gore of materials which pertained to him.Â  However, the State specifically maintained at the contempt hearing that it was not seeking a contempt violation for Goreâ€™s disclosure to a third party but, rather, due solely to Sowellâ€™s disclosure to Gore.Â  The Court of Appeals erred in utilizing this ground to affirm the contempt finding.Â  Connolly v. Peopleâ€™s Life.Â Â Â  \r\nFurther, subsection 14-7-1720 (B)(2) authorizes the designee of the Attorney General to disclose as he deems necessary to assist personnel in the performance of their duties to enforce the criminal laws.Â  This section, if applied to Sowell, would authorize Sowellâ€™s disclosure to necessary personnel (i.e. Gore) to aid him in his duties.Â  Accordingly, Sowell may not be held in willful contempt for disseminating information for which 14-7-1720 (B) (2) authorizes disclosure.Â  \r\nLastly, the trial court held that â€œGore stated in his testimony that he was not given any instruction regarding the release of this information to any other individuals [from Sowell].â€Â  As Sowell points out, however, this is not what Gore testified.Â Â  Gore was asked by the prosecution, â€œWhen Mr. Sowell left this information with you, did he give you any instructions about what to do or anything about grand jury material, anything like that?â€Â  Gore responded, â€œNo, maâ€™am.â€Â  However, Gore later testified that â€œThe best I can recall, you handed me that box and you said, â€˜These are statements that have been taken from the people in this case.Â  I want you to look through them and go investigate the ones you feel are pertinent to the upcoming case.â€Â  The query went on, â€œAnd what did I tell you about disclosing the information from that file?â€Â  [Answer]Â  â€œNo, you told me to keep the box under lock and key at all times.â€\r\nSowell subsequently testified that before he gave the information to Gore, he had instructed him not to disclose the contents to anyone.Â  We find that, to the extent the trial court held Sowell had released the information to Gore without advising him not to further disseminate it, its findings are not supported by the evidence.Â  Pratt v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Social Svcs. (contempt finding is subject to reversal where based on a finding that is without evidentiary support).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nGiven that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720 is, by its terms, inapplicable to Sowell, we find that the protective order fails to sufficiently advise him of what he must do.Â  Accordingly, the finding of contempt is reversed.Â  \r\n REVERSED.[2]\r\nMOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the majority mistakenly relies on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720(B)(2) (Supp. 2004) in overturning Sowellâ€™s contempt citation.Â  The majority correctly states that subsection (B)(2) outlines specific duties of governmental personnel involved in enforcing the criminal laws of the State.Â  However, the majority ignores the fact that the trial courtâ€™s protective order directs that the parties to this action are also subject to the restrictions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1700.Â  The Code provides that a criminal defendant is entitled to a copy of the transcript of the grand jury hearing â€œ[s]ubject to the limitations of Section 14-7-1720(A) and (D) and Rule 5, South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1700 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the language of Â§ 14-7-1700 places the same secrecy restrictions upon the criminal defendant and his counsel that the state grand jurors are subject to via Â§ 14-7-1720(A).[3]Â  This limitation dictates that â€œ[s]tate grand jury proceedings are secret, and a state grand juror shall not disclose the nature or substance of the deliberations . . . of the state grand jury.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1720(A).Â  Therefore, any disclosure under section (A) must be done under the direction of the Court.[4]Â  \r\nThe portion of the statute relied upon by the majority, Â§ 14-7-1720 (B)(2) governs those occasions when disclosure can be made without leave of the court.Â  As correctly pointed out, this section is not even applicable to Sowell.Â  Were it applicable, Sowellâ€™s disclosure to Gore would be permissible because he could have done it without the courtâ€™s permission.Â  However, because Â§ 14-7-1720(A) requires the leave of the court to disclose grand jury information, Sowell was appropriately held in contempt pursuant to Â§ 14-7-1720(D) for his disclosure to Gore.[5]\r\nTherefore, I would uphold the trial courtâ€™s decision holding Sowell in contempt.\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The order does not prohibit the defendants or their attorneys from using Brady material for purposes of preparing for trial.Â  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).Â  Â Â \r\n[2]Â  The dissent concludes Sowell was properly held in contempt pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-7-1700 and 14-7-1720 (A).Â  Section 14-7-1700 requires disclosure of grand jury proceedings to the defendant â€œsubject to the limitations of Section 14-7-1720(A) and (D).â€Â  The portion of Â§ 14-7-1720 (A) cited by the dissent applies to state grand jurors themselves stating, â€œstate grand jury proceedings are secret, and a state grand juror shall not disclose the nature or substance of the deliberations or vote of the state grand jury.â€Â  The only portion of Â§ 14-7-1720 (A) which could conceivably apply here states, â€œa state grand juror, the Attorney General or his designee, any interpreter used, the court reporter, and any person to whom disclosure is made pursuant to subsection (B)(2) of this section may not disclose the testimony of a witness examined before a state grand jury or other evidence received by it except when directed by a court.â€Â  Accordingly, this section requires a court order directing disclosure only if the disclosure was initially made pursuant to subsection (B)(2).Â  \r\nMoreover, the position advanced by the dissent would expose criminal defense attorneys who disclose grand jury materials to their office personnel for trial, investigative or discovery purposes to a finding of criminal contempt absent a court order authorizing such disclosure. \r\n[3] Under the majorityâ€™s rationale, the language contained in Â§ 14-7-1700 stating that â€œsubject to the limitations of [s]ection 14-7-1720(A) and (D) . . . a defendant has the right to review. . . . materialsâ€ is meaningless.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1700 (emphasis added).\r\n[4] The majority correctly points out that a criminal defense attorney must make clear to whom disclosure can be made by asking the court for permission to disclose under Â§ 14-7-1720(A).Â  This would include a defense attorneyâ€™s employees or office personnel.Â  The grand jury proceedings are by their very nature secretive and designed to prevent the very thing that happened in the present case - i.e. disclosure to an unauthorized person who then takes that information and divulges it to a person under investigation by the grand jury.Â  This result is not dictated by my position but rather by the very language contained in the statute.Â  The majorityâ€™s position would insulate an authorized person from penalty under the statute by allowing the authorized person to simply inform their employee of the grand juryâ€™s investigation and then leave it to chance whether that employee informs whomever he or she would like.Â  In my opinion, the integrity of the grand jury proceedings can be compromised by engaging a lawyerâ€™s office in a game of â€œwhisper down the line.â€Â  It is not overly burdensome to get the courtâ€™s permission for a specific disclosure, and obtaining such disclosure permission protects the lawyer from unauthorized down the line disclosure.\r\n[5] To further exemplify the contemptuous nature of Sowellâ€™s actions, the record indicates that a person under investigation by the grand jury, Curtis, paid a legal fee to Sowell to keep another suspect from testifying against Curtis.Â  While Curtis paying Sowell a fee might not be the reason for the trial court holding Sowell in contempt, this fact epitomizes Sowellâ€™s total disregard for the much needed secrecy in the grand jury proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26200","title":"State v.

Code Ann. Â§ 42-3-60 (1985) which provides in its entirety:Â  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 42-3-60.Â  Secretary and court reporter of commissioners.\r\nEach commissioner shall be authorized to employ a secretary and a court reporter to serve at his pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe trial court ruled that under this section the Commissionâ€™s court reporters could not be terminated pursuant to the Reduction in Force Plan and ordered their reinstatement.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in ordering Court Reportersâ€™ reinstatement?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn ruling that each individual commissioner has exclusive control over the employment of his or her court reporter under Â§ 42-3-60, the trial court looked to this Courtâ€™s precedent interpreting â€œat pleasureâ€ employment.\r\nIn Anders v. County Council for Richland County, 284 S.C. 142, 325 S.E.2d 538 (1985), we addressed a dispute over a solicitorâ€™s termination of an employee who was then reinstated by county council.Â  We held the solicitor had the exclusive power to terminate the employee under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-7-405 (2005) which provides that assistant solicitors, investigators, and secretaries â€œserve at the pleasure of the solicitor.â€Â  We concluded the employeeâ€™s reinstatement by county council was therefore improper.Â  In Heath v. Aiken County, 295 S.C. 416, 368 S.E.2d 904 (1988), we held that a sheriffâ€™s deputy was not a county employee for purposes of grievance procedures because a deputy serves â€œat the pleasure ofâ€ the sheriff, and the sheriff therefore has unbridled discretion over the employment and discharge of his deputies.Â  \r\nThese cases upheld the employerâ€™s right to control the hiring and firing of â€œat pleasureâ€ employees.Â  Similarly, Â§ 42-3-60 protects the employing commissionerâ€™s right to control the hiring and firing of the court reporter; there is nothing in the language of the statute indicating it was enacted to benefit the court reporters.Â  See Adkins v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 360 S.C. 413, 602 S.E.2d 51 (2004) (where a statute does not specifically create a private cause of action, one may be implied only if the legislation was enacted for the special benefit of a private party).Â  We conclude Court Reporters have no cause of action under Â§ 42-3-60.Â  We express no opinion regarding the extent of the individual commissionersâ€™ control over the employment of court reporters since no commissioner has pursued this cause of action.\r\nThe order of the trial court is REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Roger M.

McCulloch, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Respondent Landon was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) second offense.Â  After a pre-trial hearing, the trial judge suppressed the results of Landonâ€™s breath test.Â  The State appeals.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nLandon was involved in an auto accident at about 8:30 a.m. on December 22, 2002.Â  When Officer Bethea arrived on the scene more than an hour later, he noticed Landon had â€œa high odor of alcohol,â€ red eyes, and a flushed face.Â  Landon told the officer he had been out drinking and dancing but had stopped drinking at 2:00 a.m.Â  Officer Bethea administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test[2] and concluded Landon had â€œa measurable amount of alcohol in his system.â€Â  He then took Landon to the Richland County Detention Center for a breath test on the DataMaster machine which indicated Landon had a blood alcohol level of .14.Â  \r\nAt a pre-trial hearing, Landon moved to suppress the DataMaster results for a violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2954 (2006) which provides:\r\n\r\nThe State Law Enforcement Division and each law enforcement agency with a breath testing site is required to maintain a detailed record of malfunctions, repairs, complaints, or other problems regarding breath testing devices at each site.Â  . . .\r\n\r\nAfter initially denying the motion, on a motion to reconsider the trial judge found that the failure to keep the required records at the site of the testing mandated suppression of the breath test results.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the State violate Â§ 56-5-2954?\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did Landon show prejudice?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State claims there was no violation of Â§ 56-5-2954 and, even if there was, the breath test results should not have been suppressed because Landon failed to show any prejudice.\r\n1.Â  Requirements of Â§ 56-5-2954\r\nLieutenant Corbett Lewis, who is supervisor of the Implied Consent Department at the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED), testified there are 158 DataMaster machines at 117 sites statewide.Â  SLED is in charge of keeping records regarding all DataMaster machines.Â  All of the records for each DataMaster are available on SLEDâ€™s website, including an â€œInquiry Reportâ€ which lists the inquiries received from individual machine operators.[3]Â  The summary of each inquiry is very brief and does not include information regarding the specific problem reported.Â  A typical entry lists the date and the reporting operator, and under a column entitled â€œCommentsâ€ reads:Â  â€œBAC DataMaster information provided.Â  No inspection necessary,â€ or â€œInspection scheduled.â€Â  \r\nLewis testified that the Inquiry Report is generated from an inquiry form filled out whenever SLED receives an inquiry from a test site operator.Â  The form has six codes to describe the action taken and does not provide for a verbatim description of the specific inquiry or problem.Â  In addition, the machine itself is programmed to detect eighteen errors that will shut down the machine and generate an error code that is reported.Â  The machine operators do not repair the machines but simply report all problems to SLED.Â  An inspection report is also available on SLEDâ€™s website.Â  \r\nSLED does not require each test site to maintain separate records.Â  The Richland County Detention Center does not keep separate records on site, however, SLEDâ€™s records on the internet can be accessed at the Detention Center.Â  \r\nAs noted above, Â§ 56-5-2954 requires:\r\n\r\nThe State Law Enforcement Division and each law enforcement agency with a breath testing site is required to maintain a detailed record of malfunctions, repairs, complaints, or other problems regarding breath testing devices at each site.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge found the State had failed to comply with this statute because no separate records were kept at the testing site and the records kept by SLED were not adequate.\r\nFirst, the State contends the reference to a singular â€œrecordâ€ indicates this statute does not require that a separate set of records be kept at each testing site but only that a record be kept of each device.Â  A plain reading of the statute requires that a record be kept by both SLED and the individual agency.Â  See State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 559 S.E.2d 847 (2003) (words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction).Â  We find this requirement is satisfied by the fact that SLEDâ€™s internet records are available at the testing site itself.Â  Of greater concern is the statuteâ€™s requirement of a â€œdetailedâ€ record of specific problems with the DataMaster machines.Â  The information available on SLEDâ€™s website provides no particulars regarding problems reported by the individual testing sites.Â  We conclude the trial judge correctly found that the records kept by SLED do not satisfy the requirement in Â§ 56-5-2954 that a detailed record be maintained. Â \r\n2.Â  Prejudice\r\nThe State contends the trial judge should not have suppressed Landonâ€™s breath results without a finding of prejudice.Â  We agree and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of prejudice. \r\nRule 5, SCRCrimP, governs the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases.[4]Â  A violation of Rule 5 is not reversible unless prejudice is shown.Â  State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999).Â  The Court of Appeals has held that the failure to disclose repair and maintenance records for breathalyzer equipment pursuant to a Rule 5 request does not warrant suppression of breath test results absent a showing that such records are material to the defense.Â  State v. Salisbury, 330 S.C. 250, 265, 498 S.E.2d 655, 662-63 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  We are aware, however, that information regarding the DataMaster is exclusively within the Stateâ€™s control.Â  Because SLEDâ€™s failure to provide a detailed record significantly hampers the defendantâ€™s ability to show prejudice in this situation, we hold that once a defendant makes a prima facie showing of prejudice, the burden must shift to the State to prove the defendant was not prejudiced, either by providing records to show the machine was working properly at the time of testing or by some other contemporaneous evidence.Â  Cf. State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000) (burden-shifting on element of prejudice from prosecutorial misconduct).\r\nHere, records from the DataMaster machine that tested Landon on December 22, 2002, indicate that repairs were made to that machine on December 30th, only eight days after Landon was tested.Â  We find this evidence is sufficient as a prima facie showing of prejudice which the State now has the burden of rebutting.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the suppression of the breath test results and remand for an evidentiary hearing consistent with this opinion. \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The State may appeal such an order only if the suppression of the evidence would significantly impair the prosecution of the case.

Allen (Appellant) challenges the circuit court judgeâ€™s decision to revoke his probationary sentence.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant was sentenced in 2002 to an aggregate term of seven years in prison on drug-related convictions, suspended on the service of one year and three yearsâ€™ probation.Â  Appellant was released from prison on probation in 2003.Â  \r\nPolice responded to a shooting in the early morning hours of January 5, 2004, at an apartment complex in Greenwood.Â  An agent of the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services issued a warrant for Appellantâ€™s arrest based on his involvement in events immediately following the shooting.Â  The agent charged Appellant with violating several conditions of his probation, including associating with a person who has a criminal record.\r\nA police officer testified at the revocation hearing that a witness stated, soon after hearing gunshots, he saw two men help an apparent shooting victim get into a yellow Cadillac which then drove away.Â  The witness did not identify the men.Â  The officer testified a hospital security videotape showed Appellant getting out of the Cadillac at the emergency room entrance and entering the hospital.Â  Appellant did not remain at the vehicle when he apparently heard or noticed approaching police, but entered the hospitalâ€™s emergency room and departed through another door.Â  Police caught the other suspect in the vehicle, Nicholas Sanders, who was armed with a handgun, when he tried to flee after speaking with an officer near the vehicle. Â The victim, Lawson Hawkins, died of his wounds at the hospital.Â  \r\nA SLED agent testified the fingerprints of Appellant and Sanders were found on the Cadillacâ€™s exterior.Â  No fingerprints were found on the interior of the car.Â  Police found over a half of an ounce of cocaine and a handgun inside the car while searching it. \r\nDocuments found in the vehicle contained Appellantâ€™s name.Â  A police officer testified the vehicle was registered in the name of Appellantâ€™s grandfather.Â  The officer testified Appellant verbally admitted driving the vehicle that night and â€œthought he was there at the scene when [the victim] got shot.â€Â  Appellantâ€™s probation officer testified that Appellant, when asked about associating with Sanders, stated â€œhe just took [Sanders] to the hospital that night, or that was his brother got shot and he just took him to the hospital.â€Â  Sanders was on probation at the time as a result of previous convictions for unlawful sale of a pistol and a drug-related offense.Â  \r\nAppellant did not testify at the revocation hearing, but invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent because he had been charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, unlawful possession of a firearm, and attempted armed robbery.Â  The crimes allegedly occurred on the night of the shooting.[1]Â  \r\nThe trial court ruled Appellant had violated several conditions of his probation, including associating with Sanders, who has a criminal record.Â  The trial court noted Appellant had not offered any evidence contradicting the Stateâ€™s case, including any explanation of his actions in taking the shooting victim to the hospital or his furtive departure from the hospital.Â  The trial court revoked Appellantâ€™s probation and activated the remaining six years of the 2002 sentence, with probation terminating upon service of the sentence.\r\nWe certified this case for review on the motion of the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Appellant raises several issues, but we find it necessary to address only one:\r\n\r\nDid the trial court abuse its discretion in revoking Appellantâ€™s probation because he associated with a person who has a criminal record, a condition which is so overly broad that it violates due process?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of whether to revoke probation in whole or part rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Miller, 122 S.C. 468, 474-75, 115 S.E. 742, 745 (1923); State v. Proctor, 345 S.C. 299, 301, 546 S.E.2d 673, 674 (Ct. App. 2001); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-460 (1989).Â  The trial court must determine whether the State has presented sufficient evidence to establish that a probationer has violated the conditions of his probation.Â  State v. King, 221 S.C. 68, 73, 69 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1952); State v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 135, 61 S.E.2d 754, 756 (1950); State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 648-49, 511 S.E.2d 94, 97 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œWhile probation is a matter of grace, the probationer is entitled to fair treatment, and is not to be made the victim of whim or caprice.â€Â  White, 218 S.C. at 136, 61 S.E.2d at 756. \r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision unless that court abused its discretion.Â  White, 218 S.C. at 135, 61 S.E.2d at 756; Hamilton, 333 S.C. at 647, 511 S.E.2d at 96.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of law, such as application of the wrong legal principle; or, when based upon factual conclusions, the ruling is without evidentiary support; or, when the trial court is vested with discretion, but the ruling reveals no discretion was exercised; or when the ruling does not fall within the range of permissible decisions applicable in a particular case, such that it may be deemed arbitrary and capricious.Â  Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 539, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987); S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 229 n.6 (2d Cir. 2001).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nA condition of Appellantâ€™s probation, included on the standard probation form he signed, stated in pertinent part, â€œI shall not associate with any person who has a criminal record.â€Â  Appellant argues the trial court erred by revoking his probation by finding he associated with Sanders, who has a criminal record.Â  It was necessary for Appellant to associate with Sanders in order to help place a shooting victim in the Cadillac and drive him to the hospital.Â  Furthermore, relying on Beckner v. State, 296 S.C. 365, 373 S.E.2d 469 (1988), Appellant contends this condition violates due process and is generally unenforceable because it is overly broad.Â  Appellant asserts the condition would, for example, prohibit someone from associating with a spouse or relative who has a criminal record, or from working at a place which employed anyone with a criminal record.[2]\r\nThe State argues this condition is authorized by statute and reasonably furthers the goals of rehabilitating a probationer and protecting the public.Â  The State relies on South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-430(3) (Supp. 2005), which provides that a probationer shall â€œavoid persons or places of disreputable or harmful character.â€Â  The State does not address whether the condition is overly broad as a general rule, but asserts the trial court did not abuse its discretion in applying the condition under the facts of Appellantâ€™s case. \r\nWe have found no South Carolina authority directly on point and only two South Carolina cases discussing the validity of â€œno-associationâ€ probation conditions.Â  In Beckner, a PCR petitioner challenged a condition that he not â€œbe in a place of business that sells alcohol.â€Â  We struck down the condition as unreasonable, finding it would prohibit the petitioner from entering or working in practically every grocery or convenience store, as well as many restaurants.Â  The burden imposed on the petitioner was greatly disproportionate to any rehabilitative function the condition might serve.Â  Beckner, 296 S.C. at 366, 373 S.E.2d at 469-70.\r\nIn State v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 61 S.E.2d 754 (1950), this Court considered the validity of a condition that directed the probationer to â€œavoid persons or places of disreputable or harmful character.â€Â  The probationer operated a restaurant at the state fairgrounds near Columbia, an establishment which sold beer and included a large room between the restaurant and kitchen where illegal gambling occurred.Â  The evidence revealed the probationer was aware of illegal gambling on his premises, apparently tolerating the activity even if he was not an active participant.Â  The Court rejected the probationerâ€™s argument he was not on notice of a potential violation because probation officers had not warned him to avoid that particular location, explaining the record showed the probationer knew he was required to avoid such sites and activities.Â  The Court upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision to revoke his probation.Â  White, 218 S.C. at 136-41, 61 S.E.2d 757-59.\r\nThe Legislature has set forth certain conditions of probation which may be imposed by the court, and the court has the discretion to impose additional or specific restrictions within limits.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-430 (Supp. 2005) (listing thirteen conditions of probation and stating â€œ[t]he court may impose by order duly entered and may at any time modify the conditions of probation and may include among themâ€ the listed conditions or others not prohibited by this section); State v. Brown, 284 S.C. 407, 410, 326 S.E.2d 410, 411 (1985) (holding trial courts are â€œallowed a wide, but not unlimited, discretion in imposing conditions of suspension or probation and they cannot impose conditions which are illegal and void as against public policyâ€); Henry v. State, 276 S.C. 515, 280 S.E.2d 536 (1981) (holding trial court lacked authority to impose banishment from state if probation was revoked as a condition of probation, even though defendant appeared to agree to the sentence); State v. Brown, 349 S.C. 414, 563 S.E.2d 339 (Ct. App. 2002) (reversing trial courtâ€™s revocation of probation where vague probation condition requiring sex offender to â€œobtain treatmentâ€ resulted in confusion among the probationer and probation and mental health officials); State v. Archie, 322 S.C. 135, 470 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding that only a court, and not a state probation agency, may exercise the judicial function of imposing or modifying conditions of probation).\r\nThe revocation of probation or parole is not a stage of criminal prosecution.Â  However, a probationer or parolee has a constitutionally protected liberty interest and cannot be denied due process simply because probation has been described as an act of grace.Â  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 480-90, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 2600-05, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972) (holding that minimum requirements of due process in parole revocation proceeding include â€œ(a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a â€˜neutral and detachedâ€™ hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking paroleâ€); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 1760, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1973) (holding that â€œa probationer, like a parolee, is entitled to a preliminary and a final revocation hearing, under the conditions specified in Morrisseyâ€); State v. Riddle, 277 S.C. 110, 282 S.E.2d 863 (1981) (reversing probation revocation and remanding for hearing consistent with guidelines set forth in Morrissey and Gagnon).Â  â€œIt is an essential component of due process that individuals be given fair warning of those acts which may lead to a loss of liberty.Â  This is no less true whether the loss of liberty arises from a criminal conviction or the revocation of probation. . . . [W]here the proscribed acts are not criminal, due process mandates that [a probationer or parolee] cannot be subjected to forfeiture of his liberty for those acts unless he is given prior fair warning.â€ U.S. v. Dane, 570 F.2d 840, 843-44 (9th Cir. 1977) (citing Tiitsman v. Black, 536 F.2d 678 (6th Cir. 1976)).\r\nVarious conditions of probation generally have been upheld unless (1) the condition is so unreasonable or overly broad that compliance is virtually impossible and the burden imposed on the probationer is greatly disproportionate to any rehabilitative function the condition might serve; (2) the condition has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted; (3) the condition requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality; (4) the condition relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal unless the prohibited conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the offender was convicted or to future criminality; (5) the condition violates due process because it is overly broad or void for vagueness; or (6) the condition unnecessarily or excessively tramples upon First Amendment rights of free association.Â  See e.g. Beckner, 296 S.C. 365, 373 S.E.2d 469 (striking down an unreasonable and overly broad condition); U.S. v. Paul, 274 F.3d 155, 164-67 (5th Cir. 2001) (stating condition of supervised release under federal law will be deemed overly broad when it involves greater deprivation of liberty than is necessary to protect the public and prevent recidivism; thus, condition requiring child pornography offender to avoid both â€œdirect or indirectâ€ contact with minors was not overbroad because â€œindirect contactâ€ would not be interpreted to encompass chance or incidental encounters with children); People v. Lent, 541 P.2d 545, 548 (Cal. 1975) (discussing analysis of probation conditions); State v. Donaldson, 666 P.2d 1258, 1266-67 (N.M. App. 1983) (discussing analysis of probation conditions); People v. Lopez, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 66, 74-75 (Cal. App. 5 Dist. 1998) (holding probation condition which prohibited defendant from involvement in gang activities, association with any gang members, or use of gang insignia, was unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibited him from associating with persons not known to him to be gang members; but overbreadth was correctable by inserting a knowledge requirement in each prohibition); In re Justin S., 113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 466, 470-71 (Cal. App. 2 Dist. 2001) (prohibiting association with gang members without restricting the prohibition to known gang members is a classic case of vagueness; such a condition violates due process and is void for vagueness and overbreadth); Dawson v. State, 894 P.2d 672, 680-81 (Alaska App. 1995) (special condition of probation which forbade defendant from having any contact with his wife unless contact was approved by probation officer was unduly restrictive of liberty and could not withstand scrutiny; court made no effort to tailor scope of marital association restriction to specific circumstances of case); Huff v. State, 554 So. 2d 616 (Fla. App. 2 Dist. 1989) (condition of probation that defendant not live with member of opposite sex was invalid as not relating to defendantâ€™s crime of burglary or reasonably tailored to prevent future criminal conduct); Westâ€™s Digests, Sentencing and Punishment, Key Nos. 1960-1988 (collecting cases regarding validity of various conditions of probation). \r\nWith regard specifically to a probation condition prohibiting association with a person with a criminal record, courts generally have upheld such a condition on the ground it is related to the crime for which the offender was convicted, is intended to prevent future criminal conduct, or bears a reasonable relationship to an offenderâ€™s rehabilitation.Â  It is recognized that restrictions on the rights of association of probationers and parolees are a necessary part of the criminal justice process.Â  The evidence must show, however, that the probationer knew about the personâ€™s criminal record during the period of association before the condition may be applied to revoke probation.Â  E.g. White, 218 S.C. at 136-41, 61 S.E.2d at 757-59 (upholding application of condition which directed probationer to â€œavoid persons or places of disreputable or harmful characterâ€ where evidence revealed probationer was aware of the condition and potential violation); U.S. v. Furukawa, 596 F.2d 921, 922-23 (9th Cir. 1979) (upholding probation condition which allowed probationer to associate only with law-abiding persons); Birzon v. King, 469 F.2d 1241, 1242-43 (2d Cir. 1972) (upholding parole condition prohibiting contact with persons having a criminal record and rejecting argument the condition was so vague it violated due process); U.S. v. Albanese, 554 F.2d 543, 546-47 (2d Cir. 1977) (although probation conditions phrased in terms of â€œlaw-abiding personsâ€ should be avoided, condition that defendant associate only with law-abiding persons was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as applied to defendant who was found to have continually and consistently associated over period of years on more than casual basis with large number of convicted criminals); Alessi v. Thomas, 620 F. Supp. 589, 593 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (rejecting probationerâ€™s argument that he could not have known receipt of numerous telephone calls from felons violated condition forbidding association with persons with criminal record, a condition probationer unsuccessfully argued was void for vagueness); People v. Miller, 452 N.W.2d 890 (Mich. App. 1990) (holding probation condition which prohibited defendant from associating with man, who was father of defendantâ€™s young child and who had criminal record,\r\nfor the rest of defendantâ€™s life could not be enforced; however, condition could be amended so as to prohibit defendant from associating with the man until further order of the court); People v. Robinson, 245 Cal. Rptr. 50 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. 1988) (upholding probation condition which prohibited convicted drug offender from associating with persons with criminal record because condition was reasonably related to offenderâ€™s rehabilitation and preventing future criminal conduct); Donaldson, 666 P.2d at 1266-67 (upholding probation condition which prohibited defendant from associating with co-defendant, who had a criminal record and with whom defendant had formed a close personal relationship; condition was intended to prevent future criminal conduct and was reasonably related to defendantâ€™s rehabilitation); Annot., Propriety of Conditioning Probation on Defendantâ€™s Not Associating with Particular Person, 99 A.L.R.3d 967 (1980).\r\nA probationerâ€™s â€œassociationâ€ with a person who has a criminal record must entail more than incidental or unknowing encounters before the probationer will be found in violation of the condition.Â  â€œAssociationâ€ generally has been interpreted to mean intentional, knowing and substantial contact, or the development of a significant or meaningful relationship, with a convicted criminal over a substantial period of time.Â  E.g. Arciniega v. Freeman, 404 U.S. 4, 92 S. Ct. 22, 30 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1971) (holding a parole condition restricting association with persons with criminal record was not intended to apply to incidental contacts between ex-convicts while working on a legitimate job for a common employer); U.S. v. Bonanno, 452 F. Supp. 743, 752 (N.D. Cal. 1978) (â€œâ€˜associationâ€™ within the context of parole or probation conditions must be more than an incidental contactâ€); Alessi v. Thomas, 620 F. Supp. at 593 (finding more than forty telephone calls with convicted felons over fifteen-month period, in which probationer accepted the collect charges, was sustained and extensive contact which constituted association with persons with criminal record).\r\nIn the present case, we reject Appellantâ€™s arguments and uphold the validity of the standard condition that Appellant not associate with persons with a criminal record.Â  The condition is not so overly broad as a general rule that it violates due process in all cases; nor does application of the condition under the facts and circumstances of this case violate due process.[3]Â  The condition is reasonably related to the crime for which Appellant was convicted, is intended to prevent future criminal conduct, and should aid in Appellantâ€™s rehabilitation.\r\nWe further hold, as the trial court and other courts have recognized, that the no-association condition implicitly requires a finding that the probationer knew the person in question had a criminal record during the period of association, and that the association was not simply an unknowing or incidental encounter.Â  Thus, in order to demonstrate a prima facie violation, the State must present sufficient evidence, which may be direct or circumstantial, that a probationer intentionally had knowing and substantial contact with a person who has a criminal record, or developed a significant or meaningful relationship with that person over a substantial period of time.Â  The probationer then has the opportunity to demonstrate a lack of knowledge of the personâ€™s criminal record, a lack of any association with the person or an association which amounts to no more than an unknowing or incidental contact, or offer an explanation for the forbidden contact sufficient to excuse it.\r\nAppellant did not offer any testimony or evidence at the revocation hearing, leaving only the Stateâ€™s evidence for consideration on the extent of Appellantâ€™s association with Sanders as well Appellantâ€™s knowledge of Sandersâ€™ criminal record.Â  The Stateâ€™s evidence, and inferences which may be reasonably drawn therefrom, reveals Appellant associated with Sanders while both were involved in an illicit drug transaction which ended in a fatal shooting.Â  A yellow Cadillac belonging to Appellant, which was driven by Appellant that night to the hospital, arrived on the scene immediately after the shooting.Â  The record reveals substantial and significant contact between Appellant and Sanders during a criminal transaction, not merely an unknowing or incidental encounter.Â  Accordingly, we conclude sufficient evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s decision to revoke Appellantâ€™s probation.Â  \r\nAppellant attempted to portray himself as a mere passerby who helped carry an injured person to the hospital.Â  We find no evidence in the record supporting this position.Â  We have little doubt the result in this case would have been different if the evidence showed Appellant merely happened to drive by a crime scene and, acting as a Good Samaritan, unknowingly ferried a felon or two to the hospital.Â  \r\nWhen the trial courtâ€™s revocation decision is upheld on one ground, it ordinarily is immaterial whether probation was properly revoked on other grounds unless the entire proceeding was tainted by a given error.Â  See State v. Williamson, 356 S.C. 507, 512, 589 S.E.2d 787, 789 (Ct. App. 2003) (declining to address probationerâ€™s arguments regarding other grounds for revocation after concluding trial court properly revoked probation on one ground); Deal v. State, 640 S.W.2d 664 (Tex. App. 14 Dist. 1982) (finding that any error in revoking probation on one ground will not result in reversal of the revocation where another legitimate ground for revocation exists and was properly enforced); cf. Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  Therefore, we decline to address the remaining issues raised by Appellant. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe uphold the validity of the standard probation condition that a probationer not associate with a person with a criminal record.Â  The condition is not so overly broad as a general rule that it violates due process in all cases.Â  Application of the condition under the facts and circumstances of Appellantâ€™s case does not violate due process.Â  We further hold that the no-association condition implicitly requires a finding that Appellant knew the person in question had a criminal record during the period of association, and that the association was not simply an unknowing or incidental encounter.Â  We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Appellantâ€™s probation because the record contains sufficient evidence that Appellant associated with a person with a criminal record.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The trial court declined to continue the revocation hearing until the criminal charges against Appellant were resolved.Â  This ruling was permissible because the State did not attempt to revoke Appellantâ€™s probationÂ  based solely on those charges.Â  See State v. Gleaton, 172 S.C. 300, 304-05, 174 S.E. 12, 14 (1934) (stating that, when issue is whether probationer has committed a later crime which should result in revocation of probation, trial court may determine probationerâ€™s guilt on the charge, or impanel a jury to decide the issue, or hold the revocation matter in abeyance until the probationer is tried on the charge in the usual course, with the final option as the preferred and safest course to pursue); State v. Williamson, 356 S.C. 507, 510-12, 589 S.E.2d 787, 788-89 (Ct.

Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-112 (Supp. 2004).Â  Appellant contests the probate courtâ€™s construction and application of Â§ 62-7-112 and Seifert v. Southern National Bank of South Carolina, 305 S.C. 353, 409 S.E.2d 337 (1991), to the trust. Â We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe parties agree to the following stipulated facts and undisputed findings of fact made by the probate court:Â  \r\nJulius Clarence Dreher, Jr., (Decedent) and Appellant were married on March 21, 1968.Â  On April 4, 1988, Decedent established the J.C. Dreher, Jr. Trust (Dreher Trust).Â  Decedent and his son were designated as co-trustees.Â  During his lifetime, Decedent received disbursements from the Dreher Trust as a beneficiary.Â  Also on April 4, 1988, Decedent executed his Last Will and Testament, in which he devised the rest and residue of his estate to the Dreher Trust. Â Decedent devised to Appellant all the personal property acquired subsequent to their marriage and a bequest of $10,000.Â  Prior to his death, Decedent designated Appellant as the beneficiary of all but one of his Individual Retirement Accounts. \r\nDecedent died on June 28, 1997.Â  Appellant timely and properly filed her claim for an elective share of Decedentâ€™s probate estate.Â  Appellant sought a court order granting her an elective share, declaring the Dreher Trust invalid as illusory and thus includable in the calculation of her elective share, and removing the personal representative.Â  J. Clarence Dreher, III, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Decedent and as Trustee of the Dreher Trust, (Respondent) denied the claim and requested, among other things, that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-201 (Supp. 2005) (the elective share statute) be declared unconstitutional.Â  \r\nAfter a merits hearing, the probate court granted Appellantâ€™s request for her elective share of Decedentâ€™s probate estate.[1]Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-112, the probate court found the Dreher Trust was not illusory and thus could not be used to calculate or fund the elective share.Â  Further, the probate court found the elective share statute was constitutional and refused to remove the personal representative.\r\nThe parties agreed to appeal directly to this Court pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(g) (Supp. 2005).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n     I.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the probate court err in its construction of S.C. Code Ann.  &sect; 62-7-112 (Supp. 2004)? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n     II.\r\n    Did the probate court err in its application of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 62-7-112 (Supp. 2004) and Seifert v. Southern National Bank of South Carolina, 305 S.C. 353, 409 S.E.2d 337 (1991), to the Dreher Trust?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n     III.\r\n    Did the probate court err in finding S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 62-2-201 (Supp. 2005) constitutional?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is free to review whether the trial court properly applied the law to those facts.â€ Â J.K. Constr., Inc. v. W. Carolina Regâ€™l Sewer Auth., 336 S.C. 162, 166, 519 S.E.2d 561, 563 (1999).Â  â€œIn such cases, the appellate court owes no particular deference to the trial courtâ€™s legal conclusions.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Rec. Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995) (holding the determination of legislative intent is a matter of law).Â  This Court is free to decide questions of law with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Construction of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-112\r\nAppellant argues the probate court erred in construing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-112 (Supp. 2004).Â  We agree.\r\nIn Seifert v. Southern National Bank of South Carolina, 305 S.C. 353, 409 S.E.2d 337 (1991), a widow sought a declaratory judgment that her husbandâ€™s revocable inter vivos trust was void because the trust was illusory.Â  The Court found the husband as settlor retained extensive control of the trust during his lifetime and the trusteeâ€™s powers were â€œcustodial.â€Â  Id. at 355-56, 409 S.E.2d at 338.Â  The Court concluded the trust was illusory and held â€œwhere a spouse seeks to avoid payment of the elective share by creating a trust over which he or she exercises substantial control, the trust may be declared invalid as illusory, and the trust assets will be included in the decedentâ€™s estate for calculation of the elective share.â€Â  Id. at 357, 409 S.E.2d at 339.Â  \r\nAfter Seifert, the legislature enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-112 (effective June 23, 1992).[2]Â  This statute provided:\r\n\r\n  A revocable inter vivos trust may be created either by declaration of trust or by a transfer of property and is not rendered invalid because the trust creator retains substantial control over the trust including, but not limited to, (1) a right of revocation, (2) substantial beneficial interests in the trust, or (3) the power to control investments or reinvestments.Â  Nothing herein, however, shall prevent a finding that a revocable inter vivos trust, enforceable for other purposes, is illusory for purposes of determining a spouseâ€™s elective share rights under Section 62-2-201 et seq.Â  A finding that a revocable inter vivos trust is illusory and thus invalid for purposes of determining a spouseâ€™s elective share rights under Section 62-2-201 et seq. shall not render that revocable inter vivos trust invalid, but would allow inclusion of the trust assets as part of the probate estate of the trust creator only for the purpose of calculating the elective share and would make available the trust assets for satisfaction of the elective share only to the extent necessary under Section 62-2-207. \r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989).Â  If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, then â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  The words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  \r\nThe probate court construed Â§ 62-7-112 to prohibit a finding that a revocable inter vivos trust was illusory when a settlor retained substantial control of the trust, and the court concluded the statutory provision accordingly modified the Seifert holding.Â  The probate court also determined that unless a revocable inter vivos trust was declared illusory for a reason other than the settlorâ€™s retained substantial control, then the trust assets could not be included in the elective share calculation.\r\nThe probate courtâ€™s construction was erroneous.Â  Section 62-7-112 confirms the validity of revocable inter vivos trusts by providing such trusts shall not be declared completely invalid because the trust creator or settlor retained substantial control over the trust.Â  The statutory provision then provides, â€œNothing herein, however shall prevent a finding that a revocable inter vivos trust, enforceable for other purposes, is illusory for purposes of determining a spouseâ€™s elective share rights . . . .â€Â  The second sentence clearly conveys that no part of the statute, including the first sentence, should be construed to prevent a finding that a revocable inter vivos trust is illusory for purposes of the elective share.Â  This construction of the second sentence does not cause the first sentence to be superfluous because of the third sentence in the statute.Â  The third sentence specifically provides that a revocable inter vivos trust found to be illusory and thus invalid for elective share purposes will not be rendered completely invalid.Â  Further under Â§ 62-7-112, if a revocable inter vivos trust is illusory for elective share purposes, the trust assets become a part of the probate estate only for the calculation of the elective share and are available to satisfy the elective share to the extent necessary under Â§ 62-2-207.Â  \r\nSection 62-7-112 uses the word â€œinvalidâ€ in two contexts.Â  A revocable inter vivos trust which is illusory is invalid for purposes of determining a surviving spouseâ€™s elective share rights.Â  However, under the terms of the statute, a revocable inter vivos trust, which is illusory and thus invalid for elective share purposes, is not completely invalid.Â  Section 62-7-112 overruled Seifert to the extent that Seifert held a revocable inter vivos trust which had been declared illusory was completely invalid. \r\nII.Â  Application of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-112 and Seifert\r\nAppellant contends the probate court erred in applying Â§ 62-7-112 and Seifert to the Dreher Trust. Â We agree. \r\nThe probate court found the co-trustees paid income to Decedent; filed tax returns; and invested, monitored, and reported the assets of the Dreher Trust.Â  The probate court also found Â§ 62-7-112 specifically prohibited invalidation of the Dreher Trust because Decedent retained substantial control of the Dreher Trust until his death.Â  Based on these findings, the probate court concluded the Dreher Trust was not illusory.Â  \r\nÂ In Seifert, the inter vivos trust was revocable, and the settlor had extensive powers over the trust.Â  The trusteeâ€™s role was custodial, and the trustee was prohibited from exercising any powers of sale, investment, or reinvestment during the settlorâ€™s lifetime without the settlorâ€™s written notice or certification of the settlorâ€™s incompetence.Â  305 S.C. at 355-56, 409 S.E.2d at 338.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Decedent retained the powers to revoke the trust, to withdraw all or any part of the principal, to name a substitute or successor co-trustee, and to revoke the co-trustee requirement; he was a co-trustee and could sell, manage, invest, and reinvest trust property;[3] and as a trust beneficiary, he received income during his lifetime. Â Moreover, any benefit Appellant received from non-probate assets of Decedentâ€™s estate are irrelevant to the determination of whether the Dreher Trust is illusory because, as the surviving spouse, Appellant had a statutory right to take an elective share of one-third of the decedentâ€™s probate estate.[4]Â  See also Gallagher v. Evert, 353 S.C. 59, 67, 577 S.E.2d 217, 221 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œAny benefits the surviving spouse may obtain through non-probate assets of the deceased spouseâ€™s estate are immaterial to the surviving spouseâ€™s right to seek an elective share of the [probate] estate.â€).Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nWe conclude Decedent retained substantial control because he â€œretained such extensive powers over the assets of the trust that he ha[d] until [his] death the same rights in the assets after creation of the trust that he had before its creation.â€ Â Seifert, 305 S.C. at 357 n.2, 409 S.E.2d at 339 n.2; [5] see also id. at 355-56, 409 S.E.2d at 338 (referencing the illusory transfer test to determine whether a revocable inter vivos trust was illusory) (citing Moore v. Jones, 261 S.E.2d 289, 292 (N.C. Ct. App. 1980) (â€œonly that where, as here, the settlor retains up to the instant of his death powers over the trust assets so extensive that in a real sense he had the same rights therein after creating the trust as he had before its creation, such assets should be considered part of his estate insofar as the statutory rights granted the settlorâ€™s surviving spouse . . . .â€) and Newman v. Dore, 9 N.E.2d 966, 969 (N.Y. 1937) (describing the illusory transfer test as â€œthe test of whether the [settlor] has in good faith divested himself of ownership of his property or has made an illusory transfer. â€˜The â€˜good faithâ€™ required of the . . . settlor in making a valid disposition of his property during life does not refer to the purpose to affect his wife but to the intent to divest himself of the ownership of the property . . . .â€™â€) (internal citation omitted)).Â  We find the Dreher Trust is illusory and thus invalid for elective share purposes, but remains valid for all other purposes.Â  Â \r\nIII.Â  Constitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-201\r\nAs an additional sustaining ground, Respondent asks this Court to declare the elective share statute unconstitutional.Â  We refuse to address this issue because Respondent failed to properly raise it in this Court.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (appellate court may affirm for any ground appearing in the record on appeal); Rule 203, SCACR (notice of appeal requirements).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe probate court erred in its construction and application of Â§ 62-7-112 and in its application of Seifert to the Dreher Trust.Â  Because Decedent retained substantial control over the Dreher Trust, the trust is illusory for purposes of determining Appellantâ€™s elective share rights.Â  We cannot address Respondentâ€™s constitutional issue, and we need not address Appellantâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  We remand this case to the probate court for determination of Appellantâ€™s elective share.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.Â \r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The parties have not challenged this ruling, and the unappealed ruling is the law of the case.Â  See In re Morrison, 321 S.C. 370 n.2, 468 S.E.2d 651 n.2 (1996) (an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal).\r\n[2]Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-112 (Supp. 2004) is currently codified as S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-401(c) (Supp. 2005).Â  The current Â§ 62-7-401(c) uses the same language as former Â§ 62-7-112, except that â€œtrust creatorâ€ is now referred to as â€œsettlor.â€\r\n[3]Â  The co-trustees could not exercise their powers and discretions unilaterally, but Decedent as settlor could revoke this unanimity requirement.\r\n[4] Â Probate estate is defined as â€œthe decedentâ€™s property passing under the decedentâ€™s will plus the decedentâ€™s property passing by intestacy, reduced by funeral and administration expenses and enforceable claims.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-202 (Supp. 2005).\r\n[5]Â  We note the retention, and not the exercise, of substantial control is the key to determining whether a revocable inter vivos trust is illusory.Â  Furthermore, the retention of the power to revoke â€œgives the settlor the greatest substantial control.â€Â  William D. Macdonald, Fraud on the Widowâ€™s Share 90 (1960); see also S. Alan Medlin, Result-Oriented Interpretations of the South Carolina Probate Code Create Estate of Confusion, 44 S.C. L. Rev. 287, 300 (1993) (â€œThe right to revoke is the ultimate right that a settlor can retain; all other rights are incidental.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to Rule 607, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2006-08-14-01","description":"","date":"2006-08-21","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nRE:&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to Rule 607, SCACR \r\n \r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPursuant to Article V, &sect;4A, of the South Carolina   Constitution, Rule 607(h), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n\r\n  (h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fees for Transcription and Other   Services.\r\n  \r\n    (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Judicial Department Court Reporter.&nbsp; A court reporter shall receive the   following fees:\r\n    \r\n      (A)&nbsp; A fee of Three Dollars and Twenty-Five Cents ($3.25)   per page for producing an original transcript.\r\n      (B)&nbsp; A fee of Seventy-Five Cents ($.75) per page for   furnishing a copy of a previously prepared transcript.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t \r\n      (C)&nbsp; A fee of One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) per page   for each person receiving Real-time output when a Real-time Request is signed by   the requestor.\r\n      (D)&nbsp; A fee of One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) per page   for unedited (rough copy) ASCII Disks when no request for an original transcript   has been made.\r\n      (E)&nbsp; A fee of Thirty-Five Dollars ($35) for edited ASCII   disks.&nbsp; This service is only available to a requestor who has requested an   original or a copy of the transcript.\r\n      (F)&nbsp; A fee of One Dollar ($1) per page for condensed   transcripts, which contain no more than four pages of text.&nbsp; This service is   only available to a requestor who has requested an original or a copy of the   transcript.\r\n      (G)&nbsp; A fee of Fifty Cents ($.50) per page for Keyword   Indexing.&nbsp; This service is only available to a requestor who has requested an   original or a copy of the transcript.\r\n      (H)&nbsp; A fee of Thirty-Five Dollars ($35) for e-mailed   transcripts.&nbsp; &nbsp;This service is only available to a requestor who has requested   an original or a copy of the transcript.\r\n      (I)&nbsp; A fee of One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) per page   for unedited (rough draft) e-mailed transcripts.\r\n    \r\n    (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Private Court Reporter.&nbsp; In the event the   court reporter is not an employee of the Judicial Department, the fees to be   charged shall be that agreed upon by the court reporter and the parties.&nbsp; The   transcript produced by the Judicial Department court reporter is the official   transcript.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis amendment is effective September 1, 2006, and it shall   be applicable to all requests received by a court reporter on or after that   date.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

Act   No. 387 of 2006, effective July 1, 2006, now provides that appeals from   decisions of the administrative law court and certain agencies will be to the   Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals as provided by the South Carolina   Appellate Court Rules.\r\nSince the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules contain no   provisions regarding appeals from administrative decisions, we find that it is   appropriate to promulgate the attached emergency amendments to the South   Carolina Appellate Court Rules until this Court can submit amendments to the   General Assembly as required by Article V, &sect;4A, of the South Carolina   Constitution. These emergency amendments shall be effective immediately.\r\nAct No. 387 is not consistent regarding when the notice of   appeal must be served and filed. Compare Section 2 (under S. C. Code Ann.   &sect;1-23-380(A)(1), notice of appeal must be served and filed within thirty days   after the final agency decision, or if rehearing is filed, within thirty days   after a decision is rendered) with Section 5 (under S.C. Code Ann. &sect;1-23-610(B),   the notice of appeal must be served and filed within thirty days of receipt of   the decision of the administrative law judge). Since we have previously   construed similar language in &sect;1-23-380(A)(1) to mean that the time to appeal   runs from receipt rather than issuance of the agency decision, Hamm v. South   Carolina Public Service Commission, 287 S.C. 180, 336 S.E.2d 470 (1985), we find   that the Legislature intended the time to appeal under the Act to run from   receipt of the administrative decision, and the emergency rules reflect this   construction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

Where a transcript   of the proceeding must be prepared by the court reporter, appellant shall,   within the time provided for ordering the transcript, make satisfactory   arrangements (including agreement regarding payment for the transcript), in   writing with the court reporter for furnishing the transcript. In appeals from   the court of common pleas, masters in equity, special referees or the family   court in domestic actions, the transcript must be ordered within ten (10) days   after the date of service of the notice of appeal. In appeals from the court of   general sessions or the family court in juvenile actions, the transcript must be   ordered within thirty (30) days of the date of service of the notice of appeal.   Appellant shall contemporaneously furnish all counsel of record, the Office of   Court Administration, and the clerk of the appellate court with copies of all   correspondence with the court reporter. Unless the parties otherwise agree in   writing, appellant must order a transcript of the entire proceedings below. If a   party to the appeal unjustifiably refuses to agree to order less than the entire   transcript, appellant may move to be awarded costs for having unnecessary   portions transcribed; this motion must be made no later than the time the final   briefs are due under Rule 211.\r\n  (2) Delivery of Transcript. The court reporter   shall transcribe and deliver the transcript to appellant no later than sixty   (60) days after the date of the request. Records shall be transcribed by the   court reporter in the order in which the requests for transcripts are made.\r\n  (3) Extension for Court Reporter. If a court   reporter anticipates continuous engagement in the performance of other official   duties which make it impossible to prepare a transcript in compliance with this   Rule, the reporter shall promptly notify the Office of Court Administration in   writing of the fact, setting forth the caption of the case involved, the length   of time required to complete the transcript, and the nature and probable   duration of the conflicting official duties. The Office of Court Administration   may grant an extension of up to ninety (90) days. An extension in excess of   ninety (90) days shall not be allowed except by order of the Chief Justice.\r\n  (4) Notice of Extension. Upon the granting of   any extension of time for delivery of the transcript, the Office of Court   Administration shall notify all parties and the clerk of the appellate   court.\r\n  (5) Failure to Receive Transcript. If appellant   has not received the transcript within the allotted time nor received   notification of an extension within ten (10) days after the allotted time,   appellant shall notify the Office of Court Administration, the clerk of the   appellate court, and the court reporter in writing.\r\n  (6) Failure to Comply. The willful failure of a   court reporter to comply with the provisions of this Rule shall constitute   contempt of court enforceable by order of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n(b) Appeals From an Administrative Tribunal.\r\n\r\n  (1) Ordering the Transcript. Within ten (10)   days after the date of service of the notice of appeal, appellant shall, in   writing, make satisfactory arrangements with the administrative law court or the   agency (administrative tribunal) to obtain a transcript of the proceeding before   that body. Appellant shall contemporaneously furnish all counsel of record, and   the clerk of the appellate court with copies of all correspondence with the   administrative tribunal. Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing,   appellant must order a transcript of the entire proceedings before the   administrative tribunal. If a party to the appeal unjustifiably refuses to agree   to order less than the entire transcript, appellant may move to be awarded costs   for having unnecessary portions transcribed; this motion must be made no later   than the time the final briefs are due under Rule 211. The administrative   tribunal may establish reasonable rates for providing the transcript or a copy   thereof.\r\n  (2) Delivery of Transcript. The administrative   tribunal shall insure that the transcript is delivered to the appellant within   (60) days after the date of the request.\r\n  (3) Extension. If the administrative tribunal   cannot deliver the transcript in the time specified, it shall promptly seek an   extension from the appellate court. The request for an extension shall be in   writing and shall comply with Rule 224, SCACR.\r\n  (4) Failure to Receive Transcript. If appellant   has not received the transcript within the allotted time nor received   notification of an extension within ten (10) days after the allotted time,   appellant shall notify the clerk of the appellate court, and the administrative   tribunal in writing.\r\n\r\n(c) Duty of Appellant. The transcript received   from the court reporter or the administrative tribunal must be retained by   appellant during the entire appeal and for a period of at least one (1) year   after the remittitur (See Rule 221) is sent to the lower court or administrative   tribunal.\r\n(5) Rule 208(b)(1)(C), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(C) Statement of the Case. The statement shall   contain a concise history of the proceedings, insofar as necessary to an   understanding of the appeal. The statement shall not contain contested matters   and shall contain, as a minimum, the following information: the date of the   commencement of the action or matter; the nature of the action or matter; the   nature of the defense or of the response; the action of the court, jury, master,   or administrative tribunal; the date(s) of trial or hearing; the mode of trial;   the amount involved on appeal; the date and nature of the order, judgment or   decision appealed from; the date of the service of the notice of appeal; the   date of and description of such orders, judgments, decisions and proceedings of   the lower court or administrative tribunal that may have affected the appeal, or   may throw light upon the questions involved in the appeal; and any changes made   in the parties by death, substitution, or otherwise. Any matters stated or   alleged in appellant's statement shall be binding on appellant.\r\n(6) Rule 210(c), SCACR, is amended to read\r\n(c) Content. The Record on Appeal shall include   all matter designated to be included by any party under Rule 209 and shall   comply with the requirements of Rule 238. The Record shall not, however, include   matter which was not presented to the lower court or tribunal. Matter contained   in the Record on Appeal shall be arranged in the following order: the title   page, index, orders, judgments, decrees, decisions, pleadings, transcript,   charges, exhibits and other materials or documents, and a certificate by   appellant. Each page of the Record on Appeal shall be numbered consecutively   beginning with the index. Where a portion of a page of the trial transcript, or   a page of an exhibit or document, is to be included in the Record on Appeal, the   entire page shall be included. When a portion of an order, judgment, decision or   pleading is to be included in the Record on Appeal, the entire order, judgment,   decision or pleading shall be included in the Record, to include the caption and   signature(s); provided, however, that the portion of a pleading showing   verification or service shall not be included unless relevant to the appeal. If   the original court reporter's numbering has been deleted, the Record on Appeal   shall contain ellipses or other notation indicating when pages of the court   reporter's transcript have been omitted.\r\n(7) Rule 210(e), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(e) Index. Every Record on Appeal shall contain   an index to the principal matters therein to include orders, judgments,   decisions, pleadings, pretrial matters, opening statements, testimony, motions,   closing arguments, jury charges, post-trial motions and exhibits. For witness   testimony, the index shall show the pages on which direct, cross, redirect and   recross examination begins.\r\n(8) Rule 212(a), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(a) By the Court. The appellate court may   require copies of all or any part of the transcript of proceedings or other   matter which was before the lower court or administrative tribunal to be sent up   for its inspection and consideration. It may likewise require a report of the   trial or hearing or of any matter relative thereto, to be made by the trial   judge or administrative tribunal. These matters shall become part of the Record   on Appeal.\r\n(9) Rule 214, SCACR, is amended to read:\r\nRULE 214\r\n  CONSOLIDATION\r\nWhere there is more than one appeal from the same order,   judgment, decision or decree, or where the same question is involved in two or   more appeals in different cases, the appellate court may, in its discretion,   order the appeal to be consolidated.\r\n(10) Rule 220(c), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(c) Affirmance on Any Ground Appearing in   Record. The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or   judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\r\n(11) Rule 221(b), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(b) Remittitur. The remittitur shall contain a   copy of the judgment of the appellate court, shall be sealed with the seal and   signed by the clerk of the court, and unless otherwise ordered by the court   shall not be sent to the lower court or administrative tribunal until fifteen   (15) days have elapsed (the day of filing being excluded) since the filing of   the opinion, order, judgment, or decree of the court finally disposing of the   appeal. If a petition for rehearing is received before the remittitur is sent,   the remittitur shall not be sent pending disposition of the petition by the   court. Where a petition for rehearing has been denied, the Court of Appeals   shall not send the remittitur to the lower court or administrative tribunal   until the time to petition for a writ of certiorari under Rule 226(c) has   expired. If a petition for writ of certiorari is filed, the Court of Appeals   shall not send the remittitur until notified that the petition has been denied.   If the writ is granted by the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals shall not send   the remittitur.\r\n(12) Rule 225, SCACR, is amended to read:\r\nRULE 225\r\n  STAY AND SUPERSEDEAS IN CIVIL   ACTIONS\r\n(a) General Rule. As a general rule, the   service of a notice of appeal in a civil matter acts to automatically stay   matters decided in the order, judgment, decree or decision on appeal, and to   automatically stay the relief ordered in the appealed order, judgment, decree or   decision. This automatic stay continues in effect for the duration of the appeal   unless lifted by order of the lower court, the administrative tribunal,   appellate court, or judge or justice of the appellate court. The lower court or   administrative tribunal retains jurisdiction over matters not affected by the   appeal including the authority to enforce any matters not stayed by the   appeal.\r\n(b) Exceptions. The exceptions to the general   rule are found in statutes, court rules, and case law. Where specific conditions   must be met before the exception applies, those conditions must be strictly   complied with. A list of some, but not all, of the exceptions to the general   rule is:\r\n\r\n  (1) Money judgments as provided in S.C. Code   Ann. &sect;18-9-130.\r\n  (2) Judgments directing the assignment or   delivery of documents or personal property as provided in S.C. Code Ann.   &sect;18-9-150.\r\n  (3) Judgments directing the execution of   conveyances or other instruments as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;18-9-160.\r\n  (4) Judgments directing the sale or delivery of   possession of real property as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;18-9-170.\r\n  (5) Judgments directing the sale of perishable   property as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;18-9-220.\r\n  (6) Family court orders regarding a child or   requiring payment of support for a spouse or child as provided in S.C. Code Ann.   &sect;20-7-2220.\r\n  (7) Worker's compensation awards as provided in   S.C. Code Ann. &sect;42-17-60.\r\n  (8) An appeal from an order granting an   injunction or temporary restraining order.\r\n  (9) Family court orders awarding temporary suit   costs or attorney's fees as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;20-7-420(2).\r\n  (10) Ejectment orders as provided in S.C. Code   Ann. &sect;27-37-130 and S.C. Code Ann. &sect;27-40-800.\r\n  (11) Appeals from administrative tribunals as   provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect;1-23-380(A)(2) and &sect;1-23-600(G)(5).\r\n\r\n(c) Supersedeas or Lifting of Automatic Stay.\r\n\r\n  (1) After service of notice of appeal, any   party may move for an order lifting the automatic stay in cases which involve   the general rule. In a case subject to an exception, any party may move for an   order imposing a supersedeas of matters decided in the order, judgment, decree   or decision on appeal after service of the notice of appeal. The effect of the   granting of a supersedeas is to suspend or stay the matters decided in the   order, judgment, decree or decision on appeal and, where a prior order or   decision was in effect at the time the appealed order, judgment, decree or   decision was filed, to revive the terms of the prior order or decision.\r\n  (2) In determining whether an order should   issue pursuant to this Rule, the lower court, administrative tribunal, appellate   court, or judge or justice of the appellate court should consider whether such   an order is necessary to preserve jurisdiction of the appeal or to prevent a   contested issue from becoming moot.\r\n  (3) The granting of supersedeas or the lifting   of the automatic stay under this Rule may be conditioned upon such terms,   including but not limited to the filing of a bond or undertaking, as the lower   court, administrative tribunal, appellate court, or judge or justice of the   appellate court may deem appropriate. Further, where it appears that the   granting or lifting of a stay, or the issuance of a writ of supersedeas is   insufficient to afford complete relief, the lower court, administrative   tribunal, appellate court, or judge or justice of the appellate court may order   other affirmative relief upon such terms as are deemed appropriate.\r\n  (4) If an order is issued pursuant to Rule   225(c)(1), the terms of that order continue in effect during the pendency of the   appeal unless modified or revoked by the lower court, the administrative   tribunal or the appellate court or judge or justice of the appellate court which   issued it, or by a superior court. The granting of any relief pursuant to this   Rule shall not be construed to affect the validity of the judgment, order,   decree, decision and any liens until the judgment, order, decree or decision is   reversed or modified by the appellate court.\r\n\r\n(d) Procedure for Obtaining Lift of Stay or Supersedeas.\r\n\r\n  (1) Except where extraordinary circumstances   make it impracticable, an application for an order lifting the automatic stay or   for supersedeas must first be made to the lower court or administrative tribunal   which entered the order or decision on appeal. The issuance of an ex parte order   or decision, or an unnecessary delay by the lower court or administrative   tribunal in ruling on this application shall constitute an extraordinary   circumstance.\r\n  (2) After the lower court or administrative   tribunal has ruled, any party may petition the appellate court where the appeal   is pending or an individual judge or justice for review of this order. The   individual judge or justice may grant or deny the relief on a temporary basis,   and refer the matter to the full appellate court to hear and determine the   matter, or he or she may issue a final order. Upon the issuance of a final order   by an individual judge or justice, an aggrieved party may petition the full   appellate court for review of that decision.\r\n  (3) A person seeking an order lifting an   automatic stay or granting a writ of supersedeas must file a written petition   verified by the client. The petition shall be captioned the same as the appeal.   In addition to the petition and verification, the moving party must   contemporaneously file a certified copy of the order, judgment, decree or   decision of the lower court or administrative tribunal and a copy of the notice   of appeal with its proof of service.\r\n  (4) The petition shall contain:\r\n  \r\n    (A) the factual background necessary for an   understanding of the petition. If the facts are subject to dispute, the petition   shall be supported by affidavits or other sworn statements;\r\n    (B) the grounds for the petition, and legal   arguments with supporting points and authority;\r\n    (C) a showing that an application for this   relief was made to the lower court or administrative tribunal, and was   unjustifiably denied or that the relief granted failed to afford the relief   which the petitioner requested. A certified copy of the lower court's or   administrative tribunal&rsquo;s ruling must be included. If no application was made to   the lower court or administrative tribunal, then the petition shall state the   extraordinary circumstances which made it impracticable to make such an   application.\r\n  \r\n  (5) The petition and accompanying documents   shall be served on the opposing party(ies). Upon application to the full   appellate court, one original and six copies, and a certificate of service shall   be filed with the clerk of the appellate court. If the relief is sought from an   individual judge or justice, the original and two copies must be filed with the   judge or justice. The individual judge or justice shall forward the original   documents, including a copy of any order issued by the judge or justice in the   matter, to the clerk of the appellate court as soon as possible.\r\n  (6) A supersedeas or order lifting the   automatic stay may be issued ex parte only where exigent circumstances require   that action be taken before there is time for a hearing. An ex parte order shall   issue only if:\r\n  \r\n    (A) it clearly appears from specific facts   shown by affidavits or included in the verified petition that immediate and   irreparable injury, loss or damage will result before the opposing party can   respond; and\r\n    (B) the moving party's attorney certifies in   writing, as an officer of the court, the efforts which have been made to give   notice, or the reasons supporting the claim that notice should not be   required.\r\n  \r\n  (7) Any party aggrieved by the decision of the   lower court, the administrative tribunal, or an individual judge or justice may   petition under this Rule for a review of that decision.\r\n\r\n(13) Rule 231(a), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(a) Involuntary Dismissal and Reinstatement. Whenever it appears that an appellant or a petitioner has failed to comply with   the requirements of these Rules, the clerk shall issue an order of dismissal,   which shall have the same force and effect as an order of the appellate court. A   case shall not be reinstated except by leave of the court, upon good cause   shown, after notice to all parties. The clerk shall remit the case to the lower   court or administrative tribunal in accordance with Rule 221 unless a motion to   reinstate the appeal has been actually received by the court within fifteen (15)   days of filing of the order of dismissal (the day of filing being excluded).\r\n(14) Rule 232(b), SCACR, is amended to read:\r\n(b) Vacation of Prior Opinions, Orders or   Judgments. As part of their agreement, parties may request vacation of   previously rendered opinions, orders, decisions and judgments. However, an   appellate court retains the authority to deny any request for vacation. If an   agreement which includes a request for vacation is rejected, the parties are   free, if they so choose, to resubmit their agreement absent the request for   vacation.\r\n(15) Rule 238(a), SCACR, is amended to read:  \r\n(a) Captions. All documents filed in the   appellate court shall be headed by a caption. Except as provided below for   appeals from administrative tribunals, the caption shall contain the name of the   appellate court where the document is to be filed (i.e., Supreme Court or Court   of Appeals); if the matter involves review of a lower court decision, the name   of the county and judge from which the appeal is taken including the title of   the judge (e.g., Circuit Court Judge, Family Court Judge, Master-in-Equity,   Probate Judge, Special Referee, Special Circuit Court Judge); the title of the   case (the party commencing the action in the lower court shall always appear   first in the title regardless of whom is appellant or petitioner); the title of   the document (e.g., RECORD ON APPEAL; APPENDIX; BRIEF OF APPELLANT; PETITION FOR   WRIT OF CERTIORARI; MOTION TO DISMISS); and the name, address and phone number   of the counsel submitting the document, or in the case of a Record on Appeal or   Appendix, the names, addresses and phone numbers of all counsel in the case.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        Michael G. Sullivan; A. Camden Lewis and Peter D. Protopapas of Lewis &amp; Babcock, LLP, all of Columbia, for respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Amended Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension not to exceed two years or an indefinite suspension.Â  We accept the Agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows. \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent was admitted to the practice of law in 1981.Â  He is a sole practitioner in Columbia.Â  Prior to being placed on interim suspension, respondent devoted approximately 75% of his time to the practice of domestic law, 10% of his time to the practice of real estate law, and the remaining 15% of his time to other miscellaneous aspects of the law.Â  \r\nIn furtherance of his real estate practice, respondent entered into an arrangement with State Title, a corporation, in or around 1988, working principally through Stella Kelly, the owner, manager, and principal employee of the corporation, but also on occasion with Lauren Proctor (Kellyâ€™s daughter) who was an employee of State Title.Â  Neither Kelly nor Proctor were licensed to practice law and, during the period of the arrangement, there were no licensed lawyers employed by or working within the offices of State Title.Â  State Title maintained an office separately from respondentâ€™s law office.Â  Respondent had no interest in or position with State Title at any time. Â \r\nThe purpose of the arrangement between respondent and State Title was to have State Title provide real estate closing services to respondent and/or his law firm.Â  The arrangement remained in effect from approximately 1988 until respondent discovered significant shortages in his trust account in June 2005. The following is a description of the partiesâ€™ arrangement:Â  \r\n\r\n  1.Â  Respondent opened and maintained an IOLTA trust account with banks in his name and/or in the name of his law firm.\r\n  2.Â  The IOLTA account was originally opened with BB&amp;T and then with South Trust Bank, which merged with and is now known as Wachovia. \r\n  3.Â  Cancelled checks, bank statements, and other communications between the banks where the IOLTA accounts were maintained were sent to respondentâ€™s office, opened, and reviewed by respondent, however the communications were not as closely and carefully reviewed by respondent as he now recognizes they should have been.\r\n  4. Â Respondent caused Kelly to be a signatory on the IOLTA accounts.\r\n  5.Â  Kelly was a licensed title insurance agent and State Title was a licensed title insurance agency for Atlantic Title Insurance Company (Atlantic Title); respondent was approved to close real estate transactions where Atlantic Title was issuing title insurance.\r\n  6.Â  Atlantic Title was the principal, if not exclusive, title insurance company utilized under the arrangement between State Title and respondent. \r\n  7.Â  On approximately a monthly basis, the bank statements and cancelled checks that had been received and opened by respondent were picked up from respondentâ€™s law office by a representative of State Title, carried to the offices of State Title and, for the most part, thereafter maintained at the offices of State Title until termination of the arrangement in 2005.\r\n  8.Â  The bank statements, cancelled checks, checkbook(s) and deposit book(s) for the IOLTA accounts were, for the most part, maintained at the offices of State Title, but respondent had a checkbook and some bank records at his office. \r\n  9.Â  In connection with respondentâ€™s real estate closings handled by State Title, State Title would cause a title examination to be conducted and an abstract to be prepared, would prepare closing documents, deliver closing document to respondentâ€™s law office, pick up executed closing documents after closing, and draft checks on the IOLTA accounts for disbursement of the proceeds. Â Â \r\n  10.Â  Proceeds related to the closings were wired or deposited into the IOLTA accounts for use by State Title in making disbursements from closings conducted by respondent.\r\n  11.Â  Respondent reviewed all the closing documents prior to the closings.\r\n  12.Â  The closings were generally, if not always, at respondentâ€™s office.Â  Respondent attended all closings of the real estate transactions handled under the arrangement.\r\n  13.Â  After the closings, the executed closing documents and any proceeds related thereto and not already deposited into the IOLTA accounts would be taken back to the offices of State Title by an officer, agent, or employee of State Title and left in possession of State Title.\r\n  14.Â  State Title handled the recordation of documents from closings without supervision by or involvement of respondent. \r\n  15.Â  State Title would make disbursements from respondentâ€™s IOLTA accounts under Kellyâ€™s signature without supervision by respondent. \r\n  16.Â  Respondentâ€™s involvement in the closings ended when clients left his office and, thereafter, recordation, disbursement of proceeds, and other actions needed to complete the transactions were handled by non-lawyer personnel of State Title without supervision of respondent, to include but not limited to, correspondence with payees, lenders, and clients, payment of real property taxes on subject property, recordation of documents, payoffs of prior liens, and the like.\r\n  17.Â  For the most part, respondent had no meaningful involvement in the handling of the transactions after the clients left his law office (unless some impediment to the closing was reported to respondent) and monies and documents connected therewith were left to a non-lawyer representative of State Title for completion of the transactions.\r\n  18.Â  When respondent became aware of problems related to any of the closings, the problems were generally referred to State Title for remediation.Â Â  \r\n  19.Â  Respondent did not reconcile or thoroughly inspect the records of his IOLTA accounts until severe shortages appeared in 2005.\r\n  20.Â  No or virtually no monthly reconciliations of the IOLTA accounts were made by respondent; however respondent represents he thought Kelly was making a monthly reconciliation of the accounts and respondent relied on her to do so. \r\n  21.Â  In fact, Kelly did some type of reconciliations or recordkeeping in writing which respondent viewed, but it is now recognizes that her reconciliations were inaccurate, incomplete, and did not come close to meeting the requirements imposed by Rule 417, SCACR. \r\n  22.Â  Respondent closed numerous real estate transactions utilizing the services of State Title.[1] \r\n  23.Â  During the period of the arrangement, most client files related to the closings were maintained at the office of State Title.\r\n  24.Â  State Title would pay or absorb any charges or assessments to the bank accounts for any insufficient funds or â€œNSFâ€ checks. \r\n  25.Â  The IOLTA accounts were only to be used by State Title for transactions where respondent was the closing attorney.Â Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent now recognizes and acknowledges that there were dramatic and glaring â€œred flagsâ€ evidencing that proceeds of the real estate closings were not being safely kept.Â  These red flags include Â the following insufficient funds notices and assessments to the IOLTA accounts:Â  1) twenty-two insufficient funds checks with assessments of $526 in 2000; 2) fifteen insufficient funds checks with assessments of $392 in 2001; 3) twenty-two insufficient funds checks with assessments of $616 in 2002; 4) three insufficient funds checks with assessments of $90 in 2003; 5) forty-four insufficient funds checks with assessments of $1,320 in 2004; 6) for a portion of 2005 (until respondent ended the arrangement with State Title), there were thirty-four insufficient funds checks of $1,020; 7) in August 2004 alone, $900 was assessed against the IOLTA accounts for insufficient funds; and 8) in January 2005 alone, $600 was assessed against the IOLTA accounts for insufficient funds.Â  \r\nIn addition to the insufficient fund charges assessed against the IOLTA accounts, there were other red flags on the bank statements and cancelled checks which indicated the accounts were not being properly handled by State Title.Â  For example: \r\n\r\n  1.Â  Numerous checks totaling $40,603 were written on the accounts payable to the order of or for the benefit of Debbie Mitchell (the roommate, companion, and/or close friend of Kellyâ€™s daughter, Lauren Proctor).Â  These checks were not written, signed, or authorized by respondent.Â  Â \r\n  2.Â Â  Numerous checks totaling approximately $151,476 made payable to South Trust Bank and drawn on the accounts bore no relation to any real estate transactions closed by respondent.Â  It is now known that there were monthly payments made on an equity loan for Mitchell.Â  These checks were not written, signed, or authorized by respondent.\r\n  3.Â  Five checks payable to South Carolina Electric and Gas and one check payable to Time Warner Cable were written on the IOLTA accounts and bore no known relationship to any real estate closings handled by respondent.Â  \r\n  4)Â  During the period of the arrangement, one check was signed by Mitchell (who was not even a signatory on the IOLTA accounts).Â  This check was not written, signed, or authorized by respondent. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous assessments to the IOLTA accounts, checks written to payees unrelated to real estate closings, and a check signed by a person who was not a signatory to the accounts, respondent continued his arrangement with State Title.Â  In addition, he allowed State Title to have access to and control over the IOLTA accounts.Â Â Â  \r\nDuring the period of the arrangement, Kelly became critically ill for several months and unable to come to the office of State Title on her regular schedule.Â  Kellyâ€™s daughter, Proctor, carried on the business of State Title on her motherâ€™s behalf.Â  Respondent was aware of Kellyâ€™s serious illness and that, for a period of several months, Proctor was operating State Title and providing services to respondent under the terms of the arrangement.Â  During Kellyâ€™s absence from State Title, Proctor brought prepared documents to respondentâ€™s law office and then carried executed documents back to State Title after each closing at respondentâ€™s office.Â  Proctor signed Kellyâ€™s name to checks drawn on the IOLTA accounts.Â  \r\n It is now known that, in August 2004, there was a deposit of $50,000 into an IOLTA account from Nancy Abernathy and, thereafter, a check drawn out of the account payable to Nancy Abernathy for the same amount.Â  The deposit and withdrawal had no relationship to any client files handled by respondent.Â  Respondent did not participate in the Abernathy transaction.Â  The parties believe the transaction was arranged by someone at State Title to conceal shortages and/or other irregularities in the IOLTA account.Â  Had respondent closely reviewed the cancelled checks and bank statements, he would have recognized the account was being used by State Title for inappropriate purposes unrelated to the arrangement and recognized that there were unacceptable and inappropriate shortages in the account.Â  \r\nIt is now known that on September 30, 2004, Joan T. Sammons (Kellyâ€™s sister) borrowed money on real estate and made a $50,000 deposit into respondentâ€™s IOLTA account, presumably to cure shortages in the account and as an accommodation to Kelly.Â  The funds deposited in the account are now missing and Sammonsâ€™ mortgage is outstanding and unpaid.Â  \r\nRespondent did not participate in Sammonsâ€™ closing and it appears that someone forged respondentâ€™s name without his consent or knowledge to at least one of the closing documents in that transaction.Â  Had respondent closely examined the cancelled checks and bank records, he would have recognized the IOLTA account was being used by someone for inappropriate purposes unrelated to his arrangement with State Title.Â  Â \r\nOn or about April 1, 2005, respondent learned from Kelly that there was an unexplained shortage in the IOLTA account in the approximate amount of $60,000.Â  Respondent promptly deposited $60,000 of his own funds into the account to compensate for the shortage and directed Kelly to determine and report the cause of the shortage to him.Â  Kelly later reported to respondent that she had discovered the source of the shortage was a previously non-received wire transfer or non-deposited check that had been received and/or located and deposited into the account, thereby curing the reported shortage.[2]Â  Respondent relied on the representation from Kelly.Â  On or about April 25, 2005, respondent withdrew $60,000 from the account and deposited the amount into his personal funds and/or the firmâ€™s operating account.Â  However, respondent did not independently verify Kellyâ€™s representations as to the cause of the shortage and that the $60,000 deposit had in fact cured the reported shortages.[3]Â  \r\nOn April 8, 2005, after respondentâ€™s deposit of $60,000 into the account, two insufficient fund checks were issued on the account. Â On May 24, 2005 (after respondentâ€™s withdrawal) and again on May 25, 2005, two more insufficient funds checks were written against the account. [4]Â  The assessments for the insufficient funds checks were reported on the monthly bank statements sent by the bank to respondent.Â  It now appears that at least a portion of the $60,000 withdrawn by respondent from the account on April 25, 2005 was from monies of others, albeit unknown to respondent on the occasion of the withdrawal.Â Â  \r\nOn June 15, 2005, respondent received a telephone call from Wachovia and was advised a deposit of $195,000 was necessary in order to make good checks drawn on the IOLTA account.Â  The same day respondent raised the sum of $195,000 from his own personal funds and those of his family and made a deposit into the account.Â  \r\nRespondent contacted forensic Certified Public Accountant Roger Long to assist him in determining the source of the shortages in the account.Â  Respondent and Long worked at the offices of State Title from June 17 through 19, 2005, reviewing the files and bank records to determine the nature and source of the shortages.Â  The review indicated significant shortages in the account and other irregularities in the handling of respondentâ€™s real estate closings by State Title.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On June 20, 2005, respondent contacted an attorney.Â  The same day, the attorney and respondent met with respondentâ€™s CPA and ODC.Â  That day, respondent made a self-report of what had been learned since June 16, 2005 and he notified Atlantic Title of the shortages and problems which had been reported to ODC.Â  \r\nIt now appears that, over an extended period of time, someone (not respondent) misappropriated money belonging to respondentâ€™s clients and third parties from respondentâ€™s IOLTA accounts in excess of $838,916.Â  This amount has been reduced to approximately $643,916 due to respondentâ€™s deposit of $195,000 into the account.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFurther, it now appears that, in addition to claims regarding missing funds, State Title was not handling closings properly for respondent.Â  The improper closings include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following claims:[5] \r\n\r\n  1.Â  seven unpaid mortgages notwithstanding the funds to pay off the mortgages were collected and deposited into the IOTLA account at closing;\r\n  2.Â  five mortgages were not recorded after closing;\r\n  3.Â  two mortgages which were paid off were not satisfied by record;\r\n  4.Â  two deeds were not recorded;\r\n  5.Â  approximately twenty-eight documents had not been transmitted for recordation in a timely fashion or, in some cases, not transmitted for recordation at all; \r\n  6.Â  two cases of unpaid real property taxes where funds for the payment thereof had been deposited in the IOLTA account at closing for the payment of those taxes;\r\n  7.Â  six cases of other unpaid bills not being paid where funds for their payment were collected and deposited into the IOLTA account at closing; \r\n  8.Â  one parcel of real estate subject to a closing handled by respondent with the assistance of State Title is subject to an ongoing foreclosure action because the prior lien was not paid off after closing, notwithstanding that the sum of $213,903 was deposited into the IOLTA account for that purpose; and\r\n  9.Â  Flagstar Bank funded a real estate transaction closed by respondent where the first lien on the subject property was not paid off (although the sum of $192,292 was deposited into respondentâ€™s IOLTA account for the purpose of paying the lien), leaving Flagstar Bank in a subordinate position rather than as the superior lien holder as contemplated by both the closing instructions and the closing documents; Atlantic Title and respondent have been named as defendants in a civil action brought by Flagstar Bank.Â Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nAs the title insurance carrier for respondent in the real estate transactions closed under his arrangement with State Title and because of the shortages in respondentâ€™s IOLTA account, Atlantic Title reports as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.Â  as of November 14, 2005, Atlantic Title paid out approximately $350,000 towards claims made against it; \r\n  2.Â  additional claims pending against Atlantic Title (which it reports it will likely pay) exist in the amount of approximately $201,304;\r\n  3.Â  Atlantic Title has lost $14,441.62 in its share of premiums for title insurance issued by State Title in connection with the closings handled by respondent; \r\n  4.Â  respondent has $500,000 in Errors and Omissions coverage; the payments made by and projected losses to Atlantic Title alone are approximately $565,475, plus attorneyâ€™s fees and costs; respondentâ€™s Errors and Omissions carrier has denied coverage for the losses and claims; and\r\n  5.Â  Atlantic Title discovered problems with real estate closings conducted by respondent and unrelated to Atlantic Title. Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMatter II\r\n In November 2004, respondent closed a real estate transaction for Complainant A.Â  In April 2005, Complainant A discovered that the real property taxes had not been paid and, further, that the deed had not been recorded.Â  In his Response to Disciplinary Counsel dated May 5, 2005 (made after respondent had deposited the $60,000 in the account), respondent made no mention of the shortages.Â  He further stated that, in response to an allegation of lack of response to communications from Complainant A, that the situation was â€œâ€¦like repeatedly pushing an elevator button will not bring the elevator any faster.Â  [That] the money remained in escrow and was not applied to any other purpose.â€\r\nRespondent represents he relied on Kelly in drafting his Response to Disciplinary Counsel and it now appears that the money had been applied by someone at State Title for purposes other than intended, albeit unknown to respondent at the time he filed his Response to Disciplinary Counsel.Â  The taxes have now been paid on behalf of Complainant A and the deed has now been recorded.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nComplainant B alleges that a real estate transaction was closed by respondent in October 2004, but that her deed to the property had not been recorded as of April 2005 and a tax execution had been issued against the property notwithstanding that funds had been withheld by respondent at closing to pay the real estate taxes.Â  In his Response to Disciplinary Counsel dated May 20, 2005, (after his deposit of $60,000 into the IOLTA account) respondent blamed the problems on the Clerk of Court and stated, â€œthe money collected for taxes never left my escrow account and the Complainantâ€™s property was never at risk.â€Â  Respondent made no mention in his response about the shortages he knew existed in the account.Â  As part of his Response to Disciplinary Counsel, respondent submitted a statement from Kelly in which she took responsibility for the shortcomings and claimed they were due to her inability to obtain qualified staff during her illness.\r\nRespondent represents he relied on Kelly in drafting his Response to Disciplinary Counsel and, based on information later learned through an audit, he recognizes that, due to the account shortages and the fact that Complainant Bâ€™s property was subject to a tax execution due to failure to pay property taxes withheld at closing, Complainant Bâ€™s property is now known to have â€œbeen at riskâ€ contrary to his earlier representations.Â  The real property taxes on the subject property have now been paid and the deed has now been recorded.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nComplainant C alleges respondent closed a real estate transaction but failed to pay off a prior lien in a timely fashion.Â  In his Response to Disciplinary Counsel dated May 20, 2005, respondent represented that replacement checks were issued on January 22, 2005 (for checks that should have been issued on January 14, 2005).Â  The bank records, however, do not indicate that the earlier checks had been issued.Â Â Â  \r\nOnce again, respondent did not mention the shortages in the IOLTA account which were known to him.Â  He relied on the assistance of and/or information from Kelly in drafting his Response to Disciplinary Counsel.Â  After an audit, respondent recognizes that representations made in the Response to Disciplinary Counsel were incomplete and, in some parts, incorrect.Â  The refinanced mortgage has been paid off.Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nComplainant D alleges that respondent closed a loan transaction for her on March 31, 2005, but the payoff of the $96, 509.89 first lien was not received by the lender until approximately two months later.Â Â Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nComplainants Seller and Buyers allege respondent closed a real estate transaction but the payoff of the first mortgage lien reflected on the closing statement in the amount of $209,988.30 was not made by respondent.Â  The failure resulted in a foreclosure action against the Seller and Buyers.Â  The Sellerâ€™s mortgage has now been paid off, the foreclosure action dismissed, and the related civil suit against respondent dismissed.\r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent closed a real estate transaction for Complainant E on or about April 20, 2005, but failed to pay off the first mortgage lien in the amount of $120,292.44.Â  As a result, the lender filed litigation against Atlantic Title.Â  \r\nOn June 15, 2005, respondentâ€™s IOLTA account had a negative balance of $192,059, indicating funds to pay off the mortgage had been misappropriated.Â  The first mortgage has now been satisfied and a related civil action against respondent has been dismissed.Â  \r\nMatter VIII\r\nOn behalf of certain borrowers, $28,475 in cash or its equivalent was deposited into respondentâ€™s IOLTA account in connection with a scheduled real estate matter to be handled by respondent.Â  The funds were misappropriated and have not been located.Â Â Â  \r\nIn summary, after credit is given for amounts paid into the IOLTA account by respondent, there are estimated shortages of approximately $643,916.Â  ODC does not contend respondent misappropriated the funds or knew of or condoned the misappropriation by others.Â  However, ODC asserts, and respondent concedes, that the shortages and other problems which have come to light after June 16, 2005 would not have occurred (or at least would not have occurred to their current magnitude) had respondent strictly followed the published directives of this Court and been more alert to the red flags mentioned herein.Â Â  \r\nSince discovering the shortages and making a self-report, respondent has fully cooperated with ODC in connection with these matters. Respondent has no prior disciplinary history.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep clients informed about status of a matter); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver to client any funds or other property to which client is entitled and lawyer shall keep client funds separate from his own funds); Rule 5.3 (lawyer is responsible for conduct of non-lawyer assistants); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not assist person who is not a member of the Bar in performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice).Â  Respondent agrees his recordkeeping and money handling procedures also violated Rule 417, SCACR. Â In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  The Court denies respondentâ€™s request that the suspension run retroactively to the date of his interim suspension.[6] Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nRespondent shall not be reinstated until he has provided proof that he has paid full restitution to all persons and entities who have been harmed by his misconduct, including clients, banks, the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection, and any others.Â  \r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1] After this matter was brought to its attention, Atlantic Title was given possession of approximately 1400 of respondentâ€™s files for review.Â  \r\n[2] On April 1, the bank records indicated that there had been a check returned for insufficient funds.Â  \r\n[3] Neither respondent, his CPA, nor ODC have been able to locate any non-received wire transfer or non-deposited check and it now appears to the parties that Kellyâ€™s representations concerning the cause of the shortage were false.Â  \r\n[4] While the four checks were honored by the bank, an assessment was charged against the account for each check.Â  \r\n[5] As set forth below, some of these claims have been remediated.Â  \r\n[6] On November 9, 2005, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Smith, 366 S.C. 339, 622 S.E.2d 526 (2005).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26207","title":"In the Matter of William F.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        William F. Gorski, pro se, of Lexington. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to either an admonition or a public reprimand.Â  In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs incurred by ODC in its investigation of these matters and to undergo a law office management review.Â  We accept the agreement, issue a public reprimand, and order respondent to pay the costs incurred by ODC in its investigation of these matters and to undergo a law office management review.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn April 2000, Client A retained respondent to represent her in a divorce proceeding.Â  In February 2001, prior to the issuance of the divorce decree, Client Aâ€™s husband passed away.Â  Client A retained respondent to handle her husbandâ€™s intestate estate for which she had been appointed personal representative.Â  \r\nRespondent failed to diligently pursue probate of the estate.Â  The estate was administratively closed in November 2002.Â  Respondent spoke with Client A on December 29, 2002.Â  He did not inform her of the closing of the estate.Â  \r\nRespondent did not communicate further with Client A until April 3, 2003, after receiving notice of her complaint with ODC.Â  At that time he agreed to reopen the estate at no additional cost to Client A.Â  On July 30, 2003, respondent submitted his petition to reopen the estate.Â  Respondent then proceeded to negotiate reductions in the outstanding debts of the estate.Â  The matter has now been resolved to Client Aâ€™s satisfaction. \r\nMatter II\r\nIn November 2001, respondent ordered a transcript of a deposition from a court reporter.Â  The charge for the service was $228.20.Â  Respondent did not timely pay the bill and did not respond to the court reporterâ€™s inquiries.Â  Upon receipt of the court reporterâ€™s complaint to ODC respondent paid the debt in full.\r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent represented Client B in his divorce.Â  On March 4, 2003, Client Bâ€™s wife, pro se, appeared at the final hearing.Â  Respondent prepared the final order which was signed on June 23, 2003.Â  In that order, the judge retained jurisdiction over the matter to review and approve qualified domestic relations orders (QDROS) regarding Client Bâ€™s retirement accounts.Â  Client B requested respondent prepare a QDRO. \r\nOn October 13, 2003, Client B contacted respondent and asked that he conclude the matter.Â  By January 8, 2004, Client B had not heard from respondent so he contacted him again.Â  On March 15, 2004, respondent submitted a proposed QDRO to Client Bâ€™s former employer.Â  After revisions, a final draft was prepared and submitted to the parties for signature.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nIn January 1999, respondent was retained to represent Client C in a medical malpractice claim against the South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) and the contractor the SCDC paid to provide medical services to inmates.Â  In March 2001, respondent associated another attorney to assist him in the trial of the case.Â  Respondent and the associated attorney agreed to split the fee evenly.Â  The scope of the associated attorneyâ€™s involvement or the relative responsibilities of the two attorneys was not reduced to writing or consented to by the associated attorney.Â  The litigation was delayed for three reasons:Â  1) summary judgment was granted to the SCDC based on provisions of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act; 2) the expert witness selected by respondent could not confirm his theory of liability; and 3) the contractorâ€™s insurance company filed bankruptcy and the case was dismissed pursuant to Rule 40(j), SCRCP.Â  \r\nDuring the course of the representation, respondent provided competent representation, however, he did not adequately communicate with Client C.Â  Additionally, believing he had timely restored the case to the docket, respondent told Client C he had done so, although he had not in fact timely restored the case.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMatter V\r\nIn order to conclude three of the above-mentioned matters, respondent and ODC proposed a deferred disciplinary agreement that was accepted by the Investigative Panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission) on August 27, 2004.Â  In that agreement, respondent agreed to comply with certain terms and conditions.Â  Under those terms and conditions, respondent was to undergo a review of his law office management practices with a consultant of his choice approved by ODC.Â  This review was to be completed within six months of the date of acceptance of the agreement.Â  At the conclusion of the six month period, respondent was to file a certification of completion by the consultant.Â  Respondent was required to comply with the terms of the agreement no later than February 28, 2005.Â  \r\nRespondent did not retain a consultant, undergo the review, or file certification of completion within the six month period.Â  On July 15, 2005, an Investigative Panel terminated deferment of discipline and reopened the investigation.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nClient D alleged lack of diligence and communication by respondent.Â  Although there appears to be no merit to the underlying allegations, respondent failed to timely respond to ODCâ€™s inquires in this matter.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.5(e) (division of fees between lawyers who are not in same firm may be made only if the division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or, by written agreement with the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of the client); Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).[1]Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate a valid order of the Commission), and 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct. Further, within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC in its investigation into these matters and, within six (6) months of the date of this opinion, respondent shall undergo a law office management review as set forth in his deferred disciplinary agreement dated July 16, 2004.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26208","title":"Baggerly v.

Koon, of Koon &amp; Cook PA, of Columbia, and John S.

Millberg, of Millberg Gordon &amp; Stewart, PLLC, of Raleigh, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: This is a direct appeal from the trial courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict in favor of respondents.Â  Appellant also raises various evidentiary issues, including whether the trial court erred in excluding one of his expert witnesses, a professional engineer.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately seven a.m. on August 21, 2000, an Amtrak Silver Meteor passenger train derailed in Lake City.Â  Minutes before the derailment, a street sweeper had jumped the curb and collided with the railroad track after defendant Ervin Lucky (â€œLuckyâ€) fell asleep while operating the sweeper.Â  Appellant J.T. Baggerly was the locomotive engineer driving the Amtrak train.Â  Appellant suffered injuries from the derailment and brought suit against:Â  his employer, respondent National Railroad Passenger Corporation (â€œAmtrakâ€); the track owner, respondent CSX Transportation, Inc. (â€œCSXâ€); the owner of the street sweeper, defendant Southern Companies of South Carolina, Inc. (â€œSouthcoâ€); and the sweeper operator, Lucky.Â  Appellantâ€™s complaint alleged a Federal Employersâ€™ Liability Act[1] (FELA) claim against Amtrak, and separate negligence claims against CSX, Southco, and Lucky.Â  Appellant sought actual and punitive damages.\r\nThe trial court denied cross-motions for summary judgment, and the case proceeded to trial.Â  After appellant presented his case regarding liability, respondents moved for a directed verdict which the trial court granted.Â  The trial continued against defendants Southco and Lucky, and the jury returned a verdict for appellant, finding $577,000 in actual damages.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in directing a verdict for Amtrak and CSX?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in excluding appellantâ€™s out-of-state professional engineer expert pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-22-30?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nAppellant argues that he presented sufficient evidence to withstand respondentsâ€™ motion for directed verdict.Â  Specifically, appellant contends there was enough evidence to show that the negligence of Lucky, the street sweeper operator, combined with CSXâ€™s negligence regarding insufficient ballast on the roadbed, to bring about the derailment.Â  We agree.\r\nAppellant presented evidence from Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  two experts who each established that if CSX had maintained the proper ballast level at the point of derailment, then the street sweeper would not have collided with the cross-tie, but instead would have ridden the incline up and over the tracks, with only the tires coming into contact with the track.\r\nTom Paton, a railroad industry safety consultant and former employee of the Federal Railroad Administration, testified that CSX did not comply with its own internal specifications for ballast requirements at the point of derailment.[2]Â  When asked what factors contributed to cause the misalignment of the track, Paton responded as follows:Â  â€œWell, obviously, the fact that Mr. Lucky fell asleep and drove the sweeper up towards the tracks is a factor, and the absence of a full ballast section of the part of CSX is another factor.â€Â  As to the fact that a piece of wood from the crosstie was found lodged in the sweeperâ€™s underframe, Paton opined that the wood â€œcame from the track upon impact with the tie itself.â€Â  In addition, Paton stated that the bumper of the sweeper actually struck the rail.\r\nPaton further testified that if the ballast had been â€œfull,â€ i.e., in compliance with CSXâ€™s own specifications, â€œneither the piece of crosstie would have wedged in the undercarriage, nor would the front bumper have contacted the rail.â€Â  Paton did not believe that the street sweeperâ€™s speed was a factor because the relevant fact was that â€œthe undercarriage in the bumper struck the track itself.â€Â  Finally, Paton stated that with a proper ballast section, the air-filled tires of the sweeper would have struck the rail.Â  \r\nDon Bowden also provided expert testimony for appellant.Â  Bowden, a railroad safety consultant and former Road Master[3] for CSX, testified that at the point of derailment, the ballast was missing between the ends of the ties and had eroded down the bank of the footpath that crossed the track at that particular location; he further stated that he did not believe that CSX was in compliance with federal regulation 49 C.F.R. Â§ 213.119 which required CSX, as track owner, to comply with written procedures which address the maintenance and inspection of Continuous Welded Rail.[4]Â  In Bowdenâ€™s opinion, if the railroad track had been properly ballasted, the street sweeper should not have misaligned the track because the ballast would have protected the end of the crosstie.Â  Additionally, Bowden testified that a CSX employee in the Florence division had, at deposition, testified that in the Florence subdivision, vehicles strike CSX tracks approximately three or four times a year.\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a directed verdict, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the verdict was directed.Â  E.g., Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998).Â  If the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury. Â Id. \r\nTo establish a negligence cause of action under South Carolina law, the plaintiff must prove the following three elements: (1) a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach of duty.Â  E.g., Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 712 (2000).\r\nNormally, proximate cause is a question of fact for the jury, and it may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. Â Player v. Thompson, 259 S.C. 600, 193 S.E.2d 531 (1972).Â  Proximate cause requires proof of: Â (1) causation-in-fact, and (2) legal cause. Â Bramlette v. Charter-Medical-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 72, 393 S.E.2d 914, 916 (1990). Â Causation-in-fact is proved by establishing the injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence, and legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability. Â Id.Â  \r\nIndeed, foreseeability is considered â€œthe touchstone of proximate cause,â€ and it is determined by looking to the natural and probable consequences of the defendantâ€™s act or omission. Â Koester v. Carolina Rental Ctr., Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994). Â However, while foreseeability of some injury from an act or omission is a prerequisite to establishing proximate cause, the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant should have contemplated the particular event which occurred. Â Whitlaw v. Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251 (1991).Â  \r\nMoreover, it is not necessary to prove that the defendantâ€™s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the injury. Â Player v. Thompson, supra. Instead, it is sufficient if the evidence establishes that the defendantâ€™s negligence is â€œa concurring or a contributing proximate cause.â€ Id. at 606, 193 S.E.2d at 534.Â  â€œâ€˜[C]oncurring causes operate contemporaneously to produce the injury, so that it would not have happened in the absence of either.â€™â€Â  Id. (emphasis added, citation omitted).Â  In other words, â€œ[i]f the actorâ€™s conduct is a substantial factor in the harm to another, the fact that he neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the extent of harm or the manner in which it occurred does not negative his liability.â€ Â Childers v. Gas Lines, Inc., 248 S.C. 316, 325, 149 S.E.2d 761, 765 (1966).[5]\r\nAppellant argues that a jury issue was created regarding respondentsâ€™ liability because of the insufficient ballast level at the point of derailment. More specifically, appellantâ€™s liability theory is that the inadequate ballast level was a contributing, concurring cause which combined with Luckyâ€™s negligence to produce appellantâ€™s injuries.Â  We agree with appellant that the evidence presented was sufficient to create a jury question on each element of negligence, and therefore, the trial court erred by granting respondentsâ€™ directed verdict motion.\r\nAs to duty, it is reasonable to infer from appellantâ€™s evidence that both CSX and Amtrak had a duty to properly inspect and maintain the tracks which includes keeping proper ballast levels.[6]Â  Regarding breach, appellantâ€™s experts testified that at the point of derailment the crossties were exposed, and therefore, the ballast was not compliant with CSXâ€™s own specification drawing 2602. \r\nThe critical issue is whether appellant presented sufficient evidence of proximate cause.Â  As to cause-in-fact, both experts supplied testimony that but for the lack of proper ballast, the street sweeper would not have collided with the tie and the track.Â  Viewing the expert testimony in a light most favorable to appellant, a reasonable inference can be drawn that had the ballast been fully in compliance, the sweeper would have ridden over the tracks instead of colliding with the track and causing the misalignment.Â  \r\nAs to foreseeability, there was evidence presented that:Â  (1) sufficient ballast maintains proper track alignment; and (2) vehicles strike track three or four times per year in the Florence division.Â  Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to appellant, we conclude that a jury could have properly found it was foreseeable to CSX that the lack of proper ballast could cause a misalignment of the track due to a vehicle colliding with the track.Â  Thus, it can be reasonably inferred from the evidence that the failure to maintain the ballast level contributed in part to the derailment.Â  See Player v. Thompson, supra (the plaintiff need not prove the defendantâ€™s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the injury); see also Rogers v. Norfolk S. Corp., supra (to prove a FELA claim, plaintiff must prove that the railroad employerâ€™s negligence contributed â€œin whole or in partâ€ to the injury).Â  \r\nMoreover, it was not necessary for appellant to establish that respondents specifically foresaw that a street sweeper operator would fall asleep and collide with the track; appellant merely has to show that it was foreseeable that respondentsâ€™ act (or omission) could cause, or be a contributing cause to, appellantâ€™s injury.Â  See Whitlaw v. Kroger Co., supra (the plaintiff need not prove the defendant should have contemplated the particular event that occurred); Childers v. Gas Lines, Inc., supra (if the defendantâ€™s conduct is a substantial factor in the harm to another, the fact that he neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the manner in which it occurred does not absolve the defendant of liability).\r\nTherefore, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to appellant, we hold that the trial court erred in directing a verdict for respondents.Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, supra.[7] \r\nÂ 2.Â  Exclusion of Professional Engineer Expert Witness \r\nPrior to opening arguments, but after a jury had been selected, the parties argued several motions in limine.Â Â  Significantly, respondents moved to exclude the testimony of one of appellantâ€™s expert witnesses, Robin Harrison, a professional engineer from California.Â  Appellant had specially retained Harrison as an accident reconstruction expert and his expert testimony was also critical for the foundation of several exhibits that had been prepared.Â  Harrisonâ€™s trial testimony was going to be presented by videotaped trial deposition, and the recording of the deposition had been done in California.\r\nPursuant to South Carolina Code Section 40-22-30, the trial court granted respondentsâ€™ motion to exclude Harrisonâ€™s testimony because he was not a South Carolina licensed professional engineer.Â  Appellant argues that the trial court misconstrued the statute and erred by excluding Harrison.Â  This presents a novel issue of law.Â  When reviewing a novel question of law, we are free to decide the issue with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  E.g., Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000).\r\nTitle 40, Chapter 22 of the South Carolina Code governs the licensing of professional engineers and land surveyors.Â  Section 40-22-20 defines the practice of engineering as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  â€œPractice of engineeringâ€ means any service or creative work, the adequate performance of which requires engineering education, training, and experience in the application of special knowledge of the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences to such services or creative work as consultation, investigation, expert technical testimony....\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-22-20(22) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  Prior to 2000, however, the definition of the practice of engineering did not include the phrase â€œexpert technical testimony.â€Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-22-10(4) (2001).Â  Section 40-22-30 prohibits an individual from engaging in the practice of engineering in South Carolina without being registered pursuant to Chapter 22.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-22-30 (Supp. 2005).Â  Violation of this section is a misdemeanor subject to a penalty of imprisonment up to six months and/or a fine up to $2,000. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-22-200 (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nThe trial court found that Harrison was not competent to testify in a South Carolina court because the plain language of the statute prohibits a person from practicing engineering without a South Carolina license, and that practice includes giving â€œexpert technical testimony.â€Â  Appellant argues that the purpose of the statute is not to restrict the admission of expert testimony in state court litigation, but rather to protect South Carolina consumers from unqualified people holding themselves out as engineers.Â  In addition, appellant asserts that the trial courtâ€™s decision is not in harmony with Rule 702, SCRE, which governs expert testimony.[8]Â  We agree with appellant.\r\nRegarding statutory construction, all rules â€œare subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€ Â Kiriakides v. United Artists Commcâ€™ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994). Â Nonetheless, however plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, we will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention. Â Id. \r\nThe plain language of the statute uses the words â€œexpert technical testimonyâ€ which arguably applies to expert testimony offered in a court of law.Â  Thus, the statutory language suggests that only South Carolina licensed professional engineers are permitted to give expert engineering testimony in this State.Â  We find, however, that this result could not have reasonably been intended by the Legislature.Â  \r\nFirst, we agree with appellant that one of the primary purposes of Section 40-22-30 is to shield South Carolina consumers from those who are not properly credentialed pursuant to this Stateâ€™s standards, but who nevertheless hold themselves out to be professional engineers.Â  In the instant case, however, Harrisonâ€™s role was as an expert witness in accident reconstruction engineering.Â  His credentials, which include his status as a California licensed professional safety engineer as well as his education in mechanical engineering, go to his qualifications as an expert witness, rather than as a professional engineer offering services in South Carolina.Â  In other words, Harrisonâ€™s services were being offered to a South Carolina jury, not to the Stateâ€™s citizens seeking traditional professional engineering services.\r\nSecond, to accept the trial courtâ€™s interpretation would clearly contravene Rule 702, SCRE, which states that if â€œscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify.â€Â  Pursuant to Rule 702, Harrison plainly qualified as an expert witness; to permit his exclusion would therefore effect a significant limitation on Rule 702.Â  Without clear indication from the Legislature that the 2000 amendment was, in fact, intended specifically to limit Rule 702 in this way, we decline to adopt that interpretation.\r\nRespondents contend that because the professional engineer statute is more specific than Rule 702 and was enacted more recently, the statute should control.Â  See Langley v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 403, 438 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1993) (â€œGenerally, specific laws prevail over general laws, and later legislation takes precedence over earlier legislationâ€). Â However, we reiterate that it cannot be ignored that the effect of the 2000 amendment radically alters the scope of Rule 702.Â  By applying the engineer licensing statute literally, no out-of-state engineer could ever be an expert witness in a South Carolina state court if the testimony is even remotely related to engineering.Â  This singling-out of one type of expert witness seems to us to be an absurd result, and therefore we reject respondentsâ€™ argument.Â  Kiriakides, supra.\r\nFurthermore, if we held that exclusion of an out-of-state professional engineering expert is proper under the statute, the result would be to limit the truth-seeking duty of the courts of this State.Â  We can envision numerous litigation scenarios where a partyâ€™s position might only be supported by the expert testimony of an engineer licensed and practicing outside the state of South Carolina.Â  Yet, experts are intended to assist juries.Â  We refuse to endorse an interpretation of the professional engineer licensing statute which has the potential of either preventing out-of-state experts from testifying in South Carolina courts or imposing the unreasonable burden of getting licensed in this State simply to be permitted to provide forensic testimony.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude appellantâ€™s expert witness in accident reconstruction engineering from testifying at trial.\r\nAppellantâ€™s Remaining Issues\r\nAppellant raises several other issues.Â  These issues are affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Issues 3, 5, and 6: State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 498 S.E.2d 642 (1998); (a ruling in limine is not final; unless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling procured, the issue is not preserved for review); State v. Floyd, 295 S.C. 518, 369 S.E.2d 842 (1988) (rulings in limine do not constitute final determinations on admissibility of evidence);Â  Issue 4: Webb v. CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 656, 615 S.E.2d 440, 449 (2005) (Federal Railroad Administration report was not relevant to liability where it did not address specific breach complained of).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn summary, we reverse the directed verdict for respondents and remand for a new trial.Â  Additionally, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude the testimony of appellantâ€™s accident reconstruction expert.Â  Despite the statutory language in the definition of the practice of engineering, see Â§ 40-22-20(22), we hold that an out-of-state professional engineer may give expert testimony, if qualified under Rule 702, despite not being licensed in South Carolina.Â  Finally, we affirm appellantâ€™s remaining issues.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Roger M. Young, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] 45 U.S.C. Â§ 51 et seq. (2000).\r\n[2] According to Paton, CSXâ€™s specification drawing 2602 required a minimum of eight inches of ballast below the crosstie and full ballast even with the top of the tie.Â  It also required a six-inch shoulder level with the top of the tie and then progressing downward at a two-to-one slope.Â  This internal CSX document states that the specification is â€œthe minimum necessary to assure the track is maintained to permit safe passage of trains at authorized speed.â€\r\n[3] A Road Master is in charge of track maintenance and supervises track inspectors.\r\n[4] Bowden testified that CSX filed its specification drawing 2602 in accordance with 49 C.F.R. Â§ 213.119.\r\n[5] Likewise, for appellantâ€™s FELA claim, he must prove the traditional common law elements of negligence (i.e., duty, breach, causation and damages) and that the employerâ€™s negligence â€œcontributed, in whole or in part, to the workerâ€™s injury.â€Â  Rogers v. Norfolk S. Corp., 356 S.C. 85, 93, 588 S.E.2d 87, 91 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1085 (2004) (citing 45 U.S.C. Â§ 51 which states that a railroad a â€œshall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier ... for such injury ... resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents or employees of such carrierâ€).\r\n[6] CSXâ€™s duty to maintain the ballast is based, at least in part, by its own specification 2602.Â  See Peterson v. Natâ€™l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 618 S.E.2d 903 (2005).Â  Amtrak had a nondelegable duty to maintain the tracks by virtue of its agreement to run its trains on CSX-owned tracks and CSXâ€™s clear duty to inspect the track under federal regulations.Â  See Sinkler v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 356 U.S. 326, 331-32 (1958) (where the United States Supreme Court held that â€œwhen a railroad employeeâ€™s injury is caused in whole or in part by the fault of others performing, under contract, operational activities of his employer, such others are â€˜agentsâ€™ of the employer within the meaning of â€¦ FELAâ€).\r\n[7] We recognize that this Court has already decided a case arising out of this particular derailment.Â  See Peterson v. Natâ€™l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 618 S.E.2d 903 (2005).Â  In Peterson, a passenger on the train brought suit against Amtrak and CSX; we affirmed summary judgment in the railroad defendantsâ€™ favor.Â  Many similar arguments that are raised by appellant in this case were raised and rejected in Peterson.Â  Hence, respondents argue that Peterson compels a decision upholding the directed verdict.Â  However, the crucial evidence that was lacking in Peterson was presented at trial in the instant case.Â  We therefore agree with appellantâ€™s arguments that Peterson is distinguishable from this case.Â  \r\n[8] Rule 702, SCRE, states:Â  â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Act No. 385 of 2006 â€“ relating to defining the","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2006-08-24-01","description":"","date":"2006-08-28","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nRE:&nbsp; Act No. 385 of 2006 &ndash; relating to defining the &quot;practice of medicine.&quot;\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nAct No. 385 of 2006 &ndash; ratified 6/7/2006 and effective 6/9/2006   &ndash;substantially revises Chapter 47 of Title 40 of the South Carolina Code; the   chapter dealing with &ldquo;physicians, surgeons, and osteopaths.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Act contains   the following language:\r\n\r\n  'Practice of Medicine' means:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n  (h) testifying as a physician in an administrative, civil, or   criminal proceeding in this State by expressing an expert medical   opinion.\r\n\r\nSection 40-47-20(36), Act No. 385, 2006 S.C. Acts __.&nbsp;   Furthermore, the Act provides significant detail regarding the information that   the South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners shall require before issuing a   &ldquo;limited license&rdquo; to a physician licensed in good standing in another state who   has been engaged to testify as an expert medical witness in an administrative or   judicial proceeding in South Carolina.&nbsp; Section 40-47-35, Act No. 385, 2006 S.C.   Acts __. \r\n \r\nTraditionally, court rules allowed any witness who was qualified   as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to offer   expert testimony in a South Carolina court.&nbsp; Rule 702, SCRE.&nbsp; Furthermore, in a   lawsuit alleging a cause of action for medical malpractice, the general rule is   that expert testimony is required to show that the defendant failed to conform   to the required standard of care; specifically, the reasonable and ordinary   knowledge, skill, and diligence physicians in similar neighborhoods and   surroundings ordinarily use under like circumstances.&nbsp; Green v.   Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 192, 249 S.E.2d 910, 913 (1978) (quoting Jarboe   v. Harting, 397 S.W.2d 775, 778 (Ky. 1965)).&nbsp; Thus, although no South   Carolina statute or court rule has ever embraced the higher scrutiny applied as   a pre-requisite for the admission of expert testimony enunciated in Daubert   v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), our rules have always   charged the court with performing a &ldquo;gate keeping&rdquo; function in limiting the   presentation of expert testimony to situations where the testimony will assist   the trier of fact in understanding evidence or determining a fact in issue.[1]\r\nAfter careful consideration, we believe that while the General   Assembly certainly sought, through Act 385, to make needed revisions to the   methods South Carolina courts utilize in the area of expert medical testimony,   the effect of the revised statutes has the potential to substantially impair the   orderly administration of justice.&nbsp; Specifically, Act 385 casts serious doubt on   a physician&rsquo;s ability to offer testimony regarding the treatment provided to a   witness, party litigant, or criminal defendant if the physician, at the time of   trial, resides outside of South Carolina. &nbsp;This categorical exclusion overlooks   the fact that the physician may have treated the patient in the physician&rsquo;s home   jurisdiction, and also that the physician, although at one time licensed and   providing treatment to the patient in South Carolina, has relocated out of this   state.&nbsp; We believe requiring a treating physician to seek a South Carolina   medical license before offering often necessary testimony strains Act 385 far   beyond its intended scope.\r\nAdditionally, Act 385 is ambiguous as to its relevance to   pre-trial practices and proceedings that are of fundamental importance to the   judicial process.&nbsp; For example, Act 385&rsquo;s applicability to witnesses used during   discovery that might not be used at trial is unclear.&nbsp; Furthermore, although   expert testimony is traditionally presented by a witness offering live   testimony, lawyers often draw heavily from learned treatises authored by   prominent national experts.&nbsp; It would do a great disservice to our system of   justice if the doors of South Carolina courtrooms were closed to these scholarly   works and the country&rsquo;s leading medical scholars, who may have no intentions of   ever visiting this jurisdiction, because our state law would deem them   unqualified to offer expert testimony by virtue of their refusal to subject   themselves to the disciplinary authority of the South Carolina Board of Medical   Examiners.[2]\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution vests this Court with the   authority to make rules governing the administration of the unified South   Carolina court system.&nbsp; S.C. Const. art V, &sect; 4.&nbsp; In order to prevent a   significant impairment to this Court&rsquo;s duty to properly administer the judicial   power of South Carolina, and pursuant to Article V, Section 4&rsquo;s authority, we   hereby temporarily delay judicial enforcement of Act 385 insofar as the Act   requires a physician to obtain a license to practice medicine in South Carolina   before offering expert medical testimony in a South Carolina administrative or   court proceeding.[3]\r\nWhile we remain respectful of the General Assembly&rsquo;s voice in   matters of practice and procedure in South Carolina&rsquo;s courts, this Court cannot   allow the administration of justice to be substantially impaired.&nbsp; We are   confident, however, that when the General Assembly provides further clarity on   this matter, the changes that result will reflect careful consideration and   deliberation; will consider and account for the scope of the court&rsquo;s existing   rules and the need for efficient and orderly court administration; and will be   subjected to close scrutiny in the Judiciary Committees of both the South   Carolina Senate and the House of Representatives.\r\nThis order is effective immediately and shall remain in effect   until further order of this Court.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

Pleicones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nColumbia, South Carolina\r\n  August 24, 2006\r\n\r\n[1] In Daubert, the United States Supreme Court interpreted Rule 702 of the   Federal Rules of Evidence to require trial courts to ensure that all testimony   offered as expert scientific, technical, or specialized testimony be both   relevant and reliable, be grounded in scientific methods and procedures, and be   supported by appropriate scientific validation.&nbsp; 509 U.S. at 589-92.&nbsp;   Furthermore, the court interpreted federal evidentiary rules to require &ldquo;a   preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the   testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology   properly can be applied to the facts in issue.&rdquo;&nbsp; Id. at 592-93.&nbsp; Although   Rule 702, SCRE, contains identical language to the federal rule, we have   expressly declined to adopt this interpretation in South Carolina.&nbsp; See State   v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 20, 515 S.E.2d 508, 518 (1999) (declining to adopt Daubert; interpreting the South Carolina Rules of Evidence to require the   trial judge to determine that the evidence will assist the trier of fact, that   the expert witness is qualified, and that the underlying science is reliable;   and adopting the factors set forth in State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259   S.E.2d 120 (1979) for determining the reliability of the offered evidence).\r\n[2] We also note   that although Title 40 of the Code has always contained civil and criminal   penalties for violations of the title&rsquo;s licensing requirements and for aiding   and abetting one who violates those provisions, see S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect;   40-1-210, 40-47-260 (2001), Act 385&rsquo;s significantly broader definition of the   &ldquo;practice of medicine&rdquo; and licensing requirements now introduce the possibility   of incurring these penalties in connection with conducting a trial in South   Carolina.&nbsp; \r\n \r\nFurthermore, the Act defines the &ldquo;practice of medicine&rdquo; to   include &ldquo;rendering a written or otherwise documented medical opinion concerning   the diagnosis or treatment of a patient or the actual rendering of treatment to   a patient within this State by a physician located outside the State as a result   of transmission of individual patient data by electronic or other means from   within a state to such physician or his or her agent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Section 40-47-20(36),   Act No. 385, 2006 S.C. Acts __.&nbsp; In an effort to ensure that unintended   consequences do not overwhelm the noble motives of the legislation, these   factors further necessitate our issuing this order.\r\n[3] Because we are not presently   presented with a case or controversy questioning the constitutionality of Act   385, we reserve those serious questions for another day.&nbsp; At the present, we   rely exclusively on our Constitutional authority to police the orderly   administration of justice in the South Carolina courts. \r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of David E.

Belding, Petitioner.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n On November 10, 2003, petitioner was definitely suspended from the practice of law for one year and ordered to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceeding. In the Matter of Belding, 356 S.C. 319, 589 S.E.2d 197 (2003). This matter is now before the Court on petitioner&rsquo;s Petition for Reinstatement pursuant to Rule 33, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n After a hearing, the Committee on Character and Fitness (CCF) filed its Report and Recommendation with the Court recommending petitioner be reinstated to the practice of law. No exceptions were filed. \r\n We accept the CCF&rsquo;s Report and Recommendation and reinstate petitioner to the practice of law subject to the following two conditions: \r\n\r\n   1. For the first six months of his reinstatement, petitioner shall be supervised by an attorney-mentor approved by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC). The supervision shall include at least one weekly meeting between petitioner and the mentor. After three months of supervision and at the conclusion of the mentoring period, the mentor shall file a report with ODC documenting petitioner&rsquo;s progress; and \r\n  2. For the first six months of his reinstatement, petitioner shall participate in psychological counseling in such frequency as recommended by his therapist. After three months of counseling and at the end of the six month period, the therapist shall file a report with ODC documenting petitioner&rsquo;s progress. \r\n\r\n In the event the reports required by this order are not filed or petitioner fails to make satisfactory progress with his mentoring or counseling, ODC shall immediately notify this Court. \r\n IT IS SO ORDERED. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    s/Jean H.
