Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-80.Â  In developing the\r\n  CMP, DHEC was required to develop a system whereby it was authorized to review\r\n  all State and federal permits for compliance with the CMP.Â  Id.Â  DHEC\r\n  developed the plan and promulgated it in accordance with procedures set forth\r\n  in the CZMA.Â  Based on its interpretation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-80, DHEC\r\n  conducted what is in essence a consistency review for every state and federal permit\r\n  application to determine compliance with the CMP.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; The Spectre site\r\nSpectre sought to\r\n  develop 62.93 acres in Horry County for commercial and retail purposes.Â  As\r\n  part of the plan, Spectre proposed to fill 31.76 acres of isolated freshwater\r\n  wetlands and applied to DHEC for a stormwater/land disturbance permit, as\r\n  required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-14-10, et seq., and S.C. Reg. 72-305.Â  DHEC\r\n  denied Spectreâ€™s application because it found the project inconsistent with\r\n  various provisions of the CMP, including the following provision:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1)\r\n\t\t\tIn the coastal zone, [Office of Ocean and Coastal \r\n\t\t\tResource Management ] review and certification of permit \r\n\t\t\tapplications for commercial buildings will be based on the following \r\n\t\t\tpolicies:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tb)\r\n\t\t\t\tCommercial proposals which require fill or \r\n\t\t\t\tother permanent alteration of salt, brackish or freshwater \r\n\t\t\t\twetlands will be denied unless no feasible alternatives exist \r\n\t\t\t\tand the facility is water-dependent.&nbsp; Since these wetlands \r\n\t\t\t\tare valuable habitat for wildlife and plant species and serve as \r\n\t\t\t\thydrologic buffers, providing for storm water runoff and aquifer \r\n\t\t\t\trecharge, commercial development is discouraged in these areas.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\tThe cumulative impacts of the commercial activity which exists \r\n\t\t\t\tor is likely to exist in the area will be considered.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSpectre filed a\r\n  request for review by the DHEC Board as allowed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-1-60(E)\r\n  (2006).Â  Spectre argued, inter alia, that (1) the land in question is\r\n  not subject to the requirements of the CMP, (2) the CMP is not enforceable as\r\n  it is not a valid regulation promulgated and approved by the General Assembly\r\n  in accordance with the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and (3) there is no statutory or regulatory authority for DHEC to deny a stormwater permit\r\n  based on alleged inconsistency with the CMP.[1]Â  \r\nThe DHEC Board\r\n  unanimously affirmed the denial based entirely on the policy review of the\r\n  permit, i.e., the proposal was inconsistent with the CMP.Â  The Board rejected\r\n  Spectreâ€™s argument that the CMP is unenforceable because it was not promulgated\r\n  as a regulation pursuant to the APA.Â  Applying the CMP, the Board found that\r\n  the proposed project contravened numerous provisions and that DHEC properly\r\n  denied the application since Spectre did not show an alternative analysis, that\r\n  there were no feasible alternatives to the amount of fill, or an overriding\r\n  public interest in the project.\r\nSpectre appealed to\r\n  the ALC which reversed the Board and concluded Spectre is entitled to the\r\n  permit as a matter of law.Â  The ALC concluded (1) the CMP policies by their own\r\n  terms do not apply to the property in question, (2) the CMP is not enforceable\r\n  as it is not a valid regulation promulgated in compliance with the APA, and (3) as Spectre was in compliance with the stormwater regulations, the permit must issue\r\n  by operation of law.\r\nDHEC and\r\n  Intervenors appealed to the Court of Appeals.Â  On DHECâ€™s motion, this Court\r\n  issued an order transferring the case from the Court of Appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the ALC err in finding that\r\n  the CMP, by its own terms, does not apply to the property in question?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the ALC err in finding that,\r\n  even if the CMP purports to apply to the property in question, it is\r\n  unenforceable because it was not promulgated in accordance with the APA?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the ALC err in finding that the CMP, by its own terms, does not apply to the property in question?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe ALC found that the CMP, by its own terms, does not apply to the property in question.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  CMP was published in the State Register in 1978 in response to the General\r\n  Assemblyâ€™s statutory instruction to DHEC to develop a program for the South\r\n  Carolina coastal zone.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-80.Â  The â€œcoastal\r\n  zoneâ€ was defined to include all lands and waters in Beaufort, Berkeley, Charleston, Colleton, Dorchester, Horry, Jasper, and Georgetown counties.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-10.Â  The ALC cites two portions of the CMP as limiting\r\n  its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\tFirst, the ALC noted the following\r\n  passage:\r\n\tIn addition to the extensive areas of salt and\r\n  brackish marsh within the critical areas along the South Carolina coastline,\r\n  the Stateâ€™s coastal zone also contains over 60,000 acres of fresh-water\r\n  marshes.Â  These wetlands further up the creeks and rivers, beyond the reach of\r\n  saltwater at high tides, have great diversity of plant species.Â  They play a\r\n  vitally important role in contributing nutrients to the waters which eventually\r\n  reach the estuarine system (the critical areas).Â  Fresh-water marsh areas are\r\n  active filters for improving water quality, and since they are linked with the\r\n  downstream system, they affect water quality in the critical areas.Â  The\r\n  fresh-water marshes are important flood buffers and also function in\r\n  maintenance of salinity levels in downstream estuaries.\r\n\r\nThe ALC found the phrase â€œsince they are linked with the downstream systemâ€ to be a limitation on the\r\n  reach of the CMP and concluded the program applied â€œonly to contiguous\r\n  wetlands,â€ i.e., those connected to saltwater and not to isolated wetlands like\r\n  those located on the Spectre site.Â  \r\nThe ALC next noted that the CMP was amended in 1993 through a set of â€œrefinements,â€ which he found\r\n  expanded the applicability of the CMP.Â  The refinements included the following:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Corps of Engineers is mandated by Federal law to delineate wetlands.Â  Once\r\n  delineated by the Corps of Engineers, Coastal Council[2] manages the wetlands through the policies contained in Chapter III of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s Coastal Zone Management Program document. \r\n\r\nBased\r\n  on the above language, the ALC noted that â€œ[d]espite the clear language of\r\n  Section III-73(e) of the CMP limiting its application to those wetlands â€˜linked\r\n  with the downstream systemâ€™ of coastal rivers and creeks, the Coastal Council\r\n  began to regulate any wetland which was subject to the jurisdiction and regulation\r\n  by [sic] the Army Corpsâ€ under the Clean Water Act.Â  However, the United States\r\n  Supreme Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States\r\n    Army Corps of Engineers, 121 S.Ct. 675, 531 U.S. 159, 148 L.Ed.2d 576\r\n  (2001) (SWANCC), held that the Clean Water Act does not extend to bodies\r\n  of water not adjacent to open water, thereby severely limiting the jurisdiction\r\n  of the Army Corps of Engineers.Â Â  The ALC noted that as a result of the SWANCC decision â€œDHEC lost the ability to review federal permit applications for\r\n  projects involving isolated wetlandsâ€ like the Spectre site.[3]\r\nBecause\r\n  the site Spectre proposes to develop is unconnected to open water and is not\r\n  subject to the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers, the ALC concludes that\r\n  the CMP does not apply to the site.Â  We find the ALCâ€™s interpretation\r\n  inconsistent with the CMP when read as a whole.\r\nChapter\r\n  II of the CMP sets forth the broad scope of the program as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe scope of the coastal management program and of the\r\n  Coastal Councilâ€™s authority is based on definitions of the geographic areas and\r\n  specific resources which must be considered in development of this program.Â \r\n  Two types of management authority are granted in two specific areas of the\r\n  State.Â  The Council has direct control through a permit program over critical\r\n  areas, which are defined as coastal waters, tidelands, beaches and primary\r\n  ocean-front sand dunes.Â  Direct permitting authority is specifically limited to\r\n  these critical areas.Â  Indirect management authority of coastal resources is\r\n  granted to the Council in counties containing one or more of the critical\r\n  areas.Â  This area is called the coastal zone and consists of the following\r\n  counties along the South Carolina coast: Beaufort, Berkeley, Charleston, Colleton,\r\n  Dorchester, Georgetown, Horry, and Jasper.Â  The coastal zone includes coastal\r\n  waters and submerged bottoms seaward to the Stateâ€™s jurisdictional limits as\r\n  well as the lands and waters of the eight coastal counties.\r\n\r\nThe Spectre property is part\r\n  of the coastal zone but is not located in a critical area.Â  The CMP next\r\n  provides the following explanation of the program policies:\r\n\r\n\tOn the following pages are the Resource Policies for\r\n  each of the identified Activities Subject to Management.Â  A brief statement of\r\n  findings describes why each activity is of coastal management concern.Â  These\r\n  policies are organized in three separate sections:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1) \r\n\t\t\tPolicies for the coastal zone, \r\n\t\t\tincluding that portion outside the critical area in which the \r\n\t\t\tCoastal Council has indirect authority (review and certification).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2)\r\n\t\t\tPolicies for the critical areas, where the Coastal \r\n\t\t\tCouncil has direct permit authority. . . .\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3) \r\n\t\t\tRecommended or enhancement policies which are \r\n\t\t\tendorsed by the Coastal Council.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPolicies 1) and 2) are those which the Coastal Council\r\n  is authorized to enforce through the authority of the coastal program and the\r\n  S.C. Coastal Management Act of 1977.Â  These policies are highlighted in the\r\n  text with a bold outline along the margins.\r\n\r\nBecause the Spectre site is\r\n  located in the coastal zone but outside of a critical area, section 1) applies.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  CMP then provides the following passage, enclosed in bold outline: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1)\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;In the coastal zone, OCRM review\r\n  and certification of permit applications for commercial buildings will be based\r\n  on the following policies:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tb)\r\n\t\t\t\tCommercial proposals which require fill or \r\n\t\t\t\tother permanent alteration of salt, brackish or freshwater \r\n\t\t\t\twetlands will be denied unless no feasible alternatives exist \r\n\t\t\t\tand the facility is water-dependent.&nbsp; Since these wetlands \r\n\t\t\t\tare valuable habitat for wildlife and plant species and serve as \r\n\t\t\t\thydrologic buffers, providing for storm water runoff and aquifer \r\n\t\t\t\trecharge, commercial development is discouraged in these areas.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\tThe cumulative impacts of the commercial activity which exists \r\n\t\t\t\tor is likely to exist in the area will be considered.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(1) Linked with the downstream system\r\nThe\r\n  provision cited by the ALC as limiting jurisdiction is found in Section XII of\r\n  the CMP, entitled â€œActivities in areas of special resource significance.â€Â  The\r\n  introduction explains the sectionâ€™s purpose:\r\n\r\n\tThe following types of areas in the South Carolina\r\n  coastal zone have been identified through the resource inventory efforts of the\r\n  Coastal Council and its staff as being unique and either environmentally\r\n  fragile or economically significant to the coastal area and the State. . . .\r\n  Because of this sensitivity and their role as an integral part of the coastal\r\n  ecosystem, alterations in these areas are likely to have direct effects on the\r\n  critical areas.Â  Because of their value and characteristics the Coastal Council\r\n  employs the additional resource policies presented in this section in\r\n  review and certification of any permits associated with an activity in one of\r\n  these areas.Â  This is done in an effort to protect the value of the critical\r\n  areas and of all coastal resources.Â  The applicable policies for the individual\r\n  activity which is proposed, as well as the general guidelines for evaluation of\r\n  all projects are also considered by the Council and its staff in permit\r\n  and project reviews in these areas.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  reference to wetlands as â€œlinked with the downstream systemâ€ follows.\r\nThough\r\n  the particular portion cited by the ALC seems to address only wetlands linked\r\n  to the downstream system, there is nothing to indicate that it is meant to\r\n  overrule the broader language used earlier in the CMP.Â  To the contrary, given\r\n  the language emphasized in the above section, the best reading of Section XII\r\n  is that the policies were meant to complement, rather than limit, policies set\r\n  out earlier in the CMP.Â  We therefore disagree with the ALC that the above\r\n  passage limits the application of the CMP to those wetlands linked with the\r\n  downstream system of coastal rivers and creeks.\r\n(2) Delineated by the Army\r\n  Corps of Engineers\r\nWe\r\n  further disagree with the ALC as to the effect of the 1993 refinements.Â  In\r\n  finding that the CMP is inapplicable to the property in question, the ALC cited\r\n  the following language as limiting application of the CMP policies to wetlands\r\n  over which the Army Corps has jurisdiction: â€œOnce delineated by the Corps of\r\n  Engineers, Coastal Council manages the wetlands through the policies contained\r\n  in Chapter III of the Stateâ€™s Coastal Zone Management Program.â€\r\nThe\r\n  passage cited by the ALC, considered in context, does not support the ALCâ€™s\r\n  interpretation.Â  The passage provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe South Carolina Coastal Council is required by both\r\n  State and Federal law to review projects in the Stateâ€™s coastal zone which\r\n  require State and Federal permits to determine if the project is consistent\r\n  with the Coastal Zone Management Program.Â  To provide incentive for developers\r\n  to approach wetland management on a comprehensive basis, and to provide some\r\n  flexibility when developing adjacent to wetlands, the Coastal Council uses a\r\n  wetland master planning concept as stated below. . . . Wetland master planning\r\n  is applied to all projects undergoing consistency certification in the coastal\r\n  zone, including Section 404 wetland permits issued by the Army Corps of\r\n  Engineers.Â  The Corps of Engineers is mandated by Federal law to delineate\r\n  wetlands.Â  Once delineated by the Corps of Engineers, Coastal Council manages\r\n  the wetlands through the policies contained in Chapter III of the Stateâ€™s\r\n  Coastal Zone Management Program document.\r\n\r\nAgain,\r\n  we find nothing to overrule the broad language regarding jurisdiction set forth\r\n  in the original version of the CMP.Â  In fact, the first sentence cited above\r\n  seems to reaffirm the expansive application of the CMP: â€œThe South Carolina\r\n  Coastal Council is required by both State and Federal law to review projects in\r\n  the Stateâ€™s coastal zone which require State and Federal permits to determine\r\n  if the project is consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Program.â€Â  This\r\n  paragraph addresses the consistency review which includes, but is not limited\r\n  to federal permits, and the sentences cited by the ALC follow the phrase\r\n  â€œincluding Section 404 wetland permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers.â€Â \r\n  Therefore, the language regarding delineation merely expounds on consistency\r\n  review of federal permits, rather than imposing a limitation on the consistency\r\n  review of state permits.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  even reading the sentences cited by the ALC as imposing a limitation on review\r\n  of state permits, the ALC erroneously reads into the term â€œdelineateâ€ a\r\n  requirement that the Army Corps of Engineers have jurisdiction over the land in\r\n  question.Â  In our view, one part of the language cited above deals with the\r\n  scope of the project and the other with mapping.Â  The term â€œdelineateâ€ is defined\r\n  in part as â€œto indicate by lines drawn in the form or figure of : represent by\r\n  sketch, design, or diagram.â€Â  Websterâ€™s Third Intâ€™l Dictionary 597\r\n  (2002).Â  Under the ALC's own finding, the property in question contains a\r\n  wetland delineated by the Army Corps of Engineers.Â  Consequently, application\r\n  of the CMP is proper.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the SWANCC decision, DHEC promulgated an emergency regulation pursuant\r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-130.Â  A statement accompanying the emergency\r\n  regulation included the following:Â  â€œThe SWANCC decision held that the Corps\r\n  does not have jurisdiction over isolated wetlands and therefore removed the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s opportunity to issue water quality and coastal zone consistency\r\n  certifications for activities in those areas.â€Â  Admittedly, this statement\r\n  appears to concede that DHEC lacks statutory authority to apply the CMP to\r\n  isolated freshwater wetlands located in the coastal zone.Â  As explained below,\r\n  we believe DHEC misread SWANCC when it promulgated this regulation. \r\nThe SWANCC decision affected the ability of the federal government to require permits for\r\n  filling isolated wetlands.Â  SWANCC, 121 S.Ct. 675, 531 U.S. 159, 148\r\n  L.Ed.2d 576.Â  However, as noted above, federal jurisdiction is not essential to\r\n  consistency review.Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-80, DHEC possessed authority\r\n  to review both federal and state permits for consistency.Â  Though certain DHEC\r\n  documents overlook the agency's authority to review state permits, statements\r\n  by agency employees alone may not abrogate the authority granted by statute.Â  See City of Rock Hill v. South Carolina Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control,\r\n  302 S.C 161, 165, 394 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1990) (noting that DHEC, as a creature\r\n  of statute, possesses only those powers specifically delineated); Carolina\r\n    Nat. Bank v. State, 60 S.C. 465, 38 S.E. 629, 633 (1901) (officer could not\r\n  vary authority granted by statute). \r\nWe\r\n  find that the ALC erred in finding that the CMP, by its own terms, does not\r\n  apply to the site in question in the instant case.Â  The language of the CMP\r\n  sets forth broad jurisdiction over the coastal zone, thereby supporting DHECâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of the CMP as applicable to the Spectre site.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;Did the ALC err in finding\r\n  that, even if the CMP purports to apply to the property in question, it is\r\n  unenforceable because it was not promulgated in accordance with the APA?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe ALC found that the CMP is not enforceable as it is\r\n  not a regulation passed in accordance with the APA.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe ALC noted that the CMP, as promulgated by DHEC, is\r\n  not a regulation under South Carolina law.Â  DHEC does not dispute this finding.[4]Â \r\n  The APA provides the following:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œRegulationâ€ means each agency statement of general\r\n  public applicability that implements or prescribes law or policy or practice\r\n  requirements of any agency.Â  Policy or guidance issued by an agency other than\r\n  in a regulation does not have the force and effect of law.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-10(4) (2008).Â  According to the\r\n  ALC, because the CMP was not issued as a regulation, it does not have the force\r\n  and effect of law and consequently, DHEC may not enforce it.Â  We find that\r\n  there is no requirement that the CMP be promulgated as an APA regulation.\r\nAs noted, the General Assembly enacted the CZMA which required DHEC to â€œdevelop a comprehensive coastal management\r\n  program, and thereafter have the responsibility of enforcing and administering\r\n  the program in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any rules and\r\n  regulations promulgated under this chapter.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-80.Â  The\r\n  statute further provides that, in developing the program, DHEC shall â€œ[d]evelop\r\n  a system whereby the department shall have the authority to review all state\r\n  and federal permit applications in the coastal zone, and to certify that these\r\n  do not contravene the management plan.â€Â  Id.Â  The CZMA set out specific\r\n  procedures DHEC must follow in enacting the CMP, which included statewide\r\n  hearings and public review of DHEC documents.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  48-39-90(A), (B).Â  After conducting the hearings and considering input from\r\n  interested parties, the statute required DHEC to submit the final version of\r\n  the CMP to the Governor and General Assembly for approval.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-90(C).Â  After review and approval by the Governor and General\r\n  Assembly, â€œthe proposed plan shall become the final management plan for the\r\n  Stateâ€™s coastal zone.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-90(D).\r\nDHEC developed the CMP and promulgated it in\r\n  accordance with the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-90.Â  Respondent\r\n  argues, and the ALC found, that DHECâ€™s compliance with Â§ 48-39-90 is\r\n  insufficient to create an enforceable plan.Â  \r\n(1) Consistency Review\r\nThe ALC found that DHEC consistency review required by\r\n  Â§ 48-39-80(B)(11) is to be governed, not by the CMP itself, but by separate\r\n  regulations DHEC would create and promulgate in accordance with the APA.Â  The\r\n  ALC noted:\r\n\r\n\tThere is nothing in the [CZMA] or the CMP implying\r\n  that regulations for the consistency certification process are to be\r\n  promulgated in the CMP document itself.Â  In fact, in the Legal Authorities\r\n  section of the CMP, at p.V-1 and 2, entitled â€œAuthority Outside Critical\r\n  Areas,â€ it says â€œAll agencies currently exercising regulatory authority in the\r\n  coastal zone shall administer such authority in accordance with the provisions\r\n  of this act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.â€Â  [citation\r\n  omitted].Â  This language can only refer to coastal zone consistency\r\n  certification by the agency of state permits in the coastal counties.Â  The CMP\r\n  document itself, therefore, contemplated promulgation of regulations governing\r\n  certification as well as regulations governing critical areas.\r\n\r\nSpectre also advances this view and cites the case of Captainâ€™s\r\n  Quarters Motor Inn, Inc. v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 306 S.C. 488,\r\n  413 S.E.2d 13 (1992), for the proposition that where an agency is authorized to\r\n  promulgate certain regulations, it may not impose requirements by other means.Â \r\n  We find Captainâ€™s Quarters inapplicable as it involved a specific\r\n  statutory directive for DHEC to publish final rules and regulations, unlike the\r\n  instant case.Â  Id. at 490-491, 413 S.E.2d at 14.\r\nIn our view, the language of Â§ 48-39-80 supports\r\n  DHECâ€™s view that the General Assembly meant the CMP policies themselves to be\r\n  enforceable in the consistency review of state and federal permits.Â  As noted\r\n  above, Â§ 48-39-80 requires DHEC to develop a comprehensive coastal management\r\n  program which it will enforce â€œin accordance with this chapter and any rules\r\n  and regulations promulgated under this chapter.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-80.Â \r\n  Though Â§ 48-39-80 specifically requires DHEC to â€œ[p]rovide a regulatory\r\n    system which the department shall use in providing for the orderly and\r\n  beneficial use of the critical areas,â€ it requires only that DHEC â€œ[d]evelop a systemâ€\r\n  for reviewing state and federal permit applications in the coastal zone for CMP\r\n  consistency.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-80(A), (B)(11) (emphasis added).Â  Had the\r\n  General Assembly intended to require DHEC to promulgate regulations, it could\r\n  have so specified.Â  Moreover, the stringent requirements for enactment of the\r\n  CMP, as outlined above, suggest that the General Assembly did not believe it\r\n  was meant to be an unenforceable document.\r\nSpectre\r\n  also argues that the case of Responsible Economic Development v. South\r\n    Carolina Depâ€™t of Heath and Environmental Control, 371 S.C. 547, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  425 (2007), may be interpreted as barring DHEC's consistency review of\r\n  stormwater permits. Â We find Responsible Economic Development distinguishable from the instant case as the Court noted specifically that: \r\n\r\n\t[r]elevant to this appeal, the regulations of the\r\n  Pollution Control Act . . . and the regulations of the Stormwater Act . . . do\r\n  not reference each other and are authorized by different enabling acts.Â  In the\r\n  absence of statutory authorization to apply the two acts and their\r\n  corresponding regulations to each other, the regulations of the Pollution\r\n  Control Act do not apply to the Stormwater Act or its regulations.\r\n\r\nId. at 553, 641 S.E.2d at 428.Â  The instant case differs\r\n  from Responsible Economic Development because Â§ 48-39-80 provides\r\n  explicit statutory authorization to apply the CMP to state permits.Â  When a\r\n  state stormwater permit is sought, DHEC is authorized to enforce the CMP.\r\nFor the above reasons, we disagree with the ALCâ€™s\r\n  determination that the General Assembly intended for the promulgation of\r\n  separate regulations to govern consistency certification.\r\n(2) Effect of APA\r\nThe ALC also holds that because DHEC employs the CMP\r\n  policies like regulations, they must be promulgated in accordance with the APA\r\n  before they may be enforced.Â  In essence, the ALC holds that S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-10(4), which provides that â€œ[p]olicy or guidance issued by an agency other\r\n  than in a regulation does not have the force and effect of law,â€ repealed the\r\n  enactment procedure set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-90.Â  Consequently,\r\n  because the CMP did not comply with the APA, the CMP is not enforceable.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  The General Assembly created a separate and more rigorous procedure\r\n  for promulgation of the CMP and, because DHEC acted in accordance with the\r\n  specified procedure, the plan is valid.\r\nâ€œRepeal by implication is disfavored, and is\r\n  found only when two statutes are incapable of any reasonable reconcilement.â€Â  Capco\r\n    of Summerville, Inc. v. J.H. Gayle Const. Co., Inc., 368 S.C. 137, 141-42,\r\n  628 S.E.2d 38, 41 (2006), citing Mims v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 440\r\n  S.E.2d 357 (1994).Â  Moreover, the repugnancy must be plain, and if the two\r\n  provisions can be construed so that both can stand, a court shall so construe\r\n  them.Â  Id., citing City of Rock Hill v. South Carolina DHEC, 302\r\n  S.C. 161, 167, 394 S.E.2d 327, 331 (1990).Â  Where there is one statute\r\n  addressing an issue in general terms and another statute dealing with the\r\n  identical issue in a more specific and definite manner, the more specific\r\n  statute will be considered an exception to, or a qualifier of, the general\r\n  statute and given such effect.Â  Wilder v. South Carolina Hwy. Depâ€™t, 228\r\n  S.C. 448, 90 S.E.2d 635 (1955); see also Wooten ex rel. Wooten v.\r\n    S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 468, 511 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1999) (a\r\n  specific statutory provision prevails over a more general one).Â  \r\nSection 48-39-90 constitutes a specific enactment\r\n  procedure for the CMP with more rigorous requirements than those in the APA.Â \r\n  Under the APA, proposed regulations go into effect 120 days after they are\r\n  submitted to the appropriate House and Senate Committees upon publication in\r\n  the State Register unless they are affirmatively vetoed by the legislature.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-120(D).Â  In contrast, Â§ 48-39-90 requires that the\r\n  General Assembly and Governor affirmatively approve of the CMP before it is effective.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-90.Â  \r\nThis reading better comports with the history of the\r\n  CZMA and APA.Â  The two acts were passed in the same year.Â  See 1977 Act\r\n  No. 123; 1977 Act No. 176.Â  The General Assembly was fully aware of the APA and\r\n  in fact references it in the CZMA, directing the Coastal Council to promulgate\r\n  rules and regulations addressing critical areas in accordance with the APA.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-130(B) (2008).Â  The General Assembly would not have\r\n  established the rigorous enactment requirements of the CMP if it believed that\r\n  the subsequent enactment of the APA would render it ineffective.\r\nWe find that the ALC erred in holding that, because\r\n  the CMP was not promulgated in accordance with the APA, it is unenforceable.Â \r\n  The CMP was enacted in accordance with the specific procedures set forth by the\r\n  General Assembly in Â§ 48-39-90 and, consequently, is valid and enforceable.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that the ALC erred in finding that the CMP, by\r\n  its own terms, does not apply to the property in question and in finding that\r\n  the CMP is not enforceable.Â  Consequently, the ALC erred in finding that the\r\n  stormwater permit must issue by operation of law.Â  We therefore reverse the\r\n  ALC.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The League of Women Voters of Georgetown County and the League of Women Voters\r\n  of South Carolina filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings.Â  The Board\r\n  granted their motion and they are parties to this appeal.\r\n[2] The Coastal Council was abolished July 1, 1994 and the responsibility for\r\n  administration of the Coastal Zone Management Act was transferred to the Office\r\n  of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) in DHEC.Â  See 1993 Act\r\n  No. 181.\r\n[3] We note that federal permits are not at issue in this case.\r\n[4] DHEC does argue that the CMP is the equivalent of a regulation but does not\r\n  contend that it was passed in accordance with APA procedures.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26765","title":"State v.

Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General\r\n  Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia, and John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Appellant was tried in\r\n    absentia and convicted of trafficking cocaine more than ten grams but less\r\n  than twenty-eight.Â  Subsequently, appellant appeared and his sealed sentence\r\n  was opened. Â The three-year sealed sentence was imposed without objection.Â  On\r\n  appeal, appellant contends the trial judge erred in admitting drug evidence\r\n  because the chain of custody was deficient.Â  We find no error, and affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe police took a\r\n  Confidential Informant (C.I.), who had been searched, wired, and provided with\r\n  marked bills, to the apartment complex where appellant lived.Â  They observed\r\n  the C.I. and appellant speak outside the building, then enter appellant's\r\n  apartment which they had under surveillance.Â  They then listened to, but did\r\n  not observe, an alleged drug transaction between the C.I. and appellant.Â  When\r\n  the C.I. exited appellant's apartment about ten minutes later, the officers\r\n  observed him as he walked through the apartment complex to a parking lot.Â  He\r\n  met the police there, and provided them with cocaine.Â  \r\nAs soon as the C.I.\r\n  began to leave the scene, officers approached appellant's apartment.Â  When he\r\n  refused to answer the door after they knocked, the officers forcibly entered\r\n  the residence where they found only appellant present.Â  Appellant was arrested,\r\n  a search warrant was obtained, and a search of appellant's apartment led to\r\n  discovery of the marked bills given to the C.I., drug paraphernalia, and\r\n  marijuana.\r\nAt trial,\r\n  appellant's attorney objected to the admissibility of the cocaine, arguing that\r\n  the State's failure to call the C.I. rendered the chain of custody fatally\r\n  incomplete.Â  The trial judge disagreed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  the trial judge erred in admitting the cocaine because the State failed to\r\n  prove a sufficient chain of custody?\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant\r\n  readily concedes that the chain of custody from the time the C.I. gave the\r\n  drugs to the first officer is unassailable.Â  He contends, however, that the\r\n  State's failure to present evidence from the C.I. renders the cocaine the C.I.\r\n  allegedly purchased from appellant inadmissible, and that the trial judge\r\n  therefore abused his discretion in admitting it. Â Â State v. Sweet, 374\r\n  S.C. 1, 647 S.E.2d 202 (2007).Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Sweet,\r\n  the State did not call the C.I. at trial nor did it present an affidavit from\r\n  him.Â  Furthermore, the State did not reveal his identity.Â  In reversing, we\r\n  held:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  other words, the State simply did not present proof of the chain of custody as\r\n  far as practicable.Â  For these reasons, the informant's possession of the drug\r\n  evidence may not be reduced to an issue of mere credibility based solely on the\r\n  officer's knowledge of the informant's name.\r\n\tAlthough\r\n  our courts have been willing to fill in gaps in the chain of custody where\r\n  other evidence reasonably demonstrates the identity of each individual in the\r\n  chain of custody and the manner of handling of the evidence, such circumstances\r\n  are not present here.\r\n\tSweet, 374 S.C. at 8-9, 647 S.E.2d at 207.\r\n\r\nUnlike Sweet,\r\n  in this case the identity of the C.I. was known to the appellant, and the\r\n  defense was able to fully explore the C.I.'s criminal history, and the terms of\r\n  the deal by which the C.I. arranged to buy drugs from appellant, the C.I.'s\r\n  cousin.Â  Moreover, whereas the C.I. in Sweet was permitted to travel to\r\n  and from the transaction site in his personal automobile, the C.I. here was\r\n  under direct police observation except during the approximately ten minutes he\r\n  was in the apartment and only under audio surveillance.\r\nAs we explained in Sweet,\r\n  &quot;Where other evidence establishes the identity of those who have handled\r\n  the evidence and reasonably demonstrates the manner of handling the evidence,\r\n  our courts have been willing to fill gaps in the chain of custody due to an\r\n  absent witness.&quot;Â  374 S.C. at 7, 647 S.E.2d at 206 (internal citation\r\n  omitted).Â  Here, the State established the C.I.'s identity, and reasonably\r\n  demonstrated the manner in which the cocaine was handled.\r\nWe find no abuse of\r\n  discretion in the trial judge's decision to admit this cocaine.Â  State v.\r\n    Sweet, supra.Â  Appellant's conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  and Acting Justice Howard P.

Bryan\r\n  Doby, of Jennings and Jennings, PA, of Bishopville,\r\n  for respondent.Â Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this judicial disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to the imposition of a public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE,\r\n  Rule 502, SCACR.[1]Â  The facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis matter was referred to ODC following\r\n  an internal investigation at the Department of Public Safety (DPS).Â  DPS had\r\n  received information that State Transport police officers had been instructed\r\n  through the chain of command to curtail or cease certain enforcement activity\r\n  at the Lee County Landfill and to &quot;nolle pros&quot; or reduce tickets\r\n  which had already been issued to county or municipal government trucks.Â  Two State\r\n  Transport officers also reported they had been approached by Lee County\r\n  magistrates for &quot;help&quot; on tickets.Â Â Â  \r\nRespondent maintains he is contacted\r\n  approximately five times per year by a legislator for help on tickets on behalf\r\n  of constituents and that he, in turn, contacts the officers to see if help is\r\n  available.Â  Respondent also talks to officers if a violator calls and requests\r\n  help on a ticket.Â  \r\nRespondent admits that, on one occasion,\r\n  he was contactedÂ  by a county administrator regarding a weight ticket issued by\r\n  the State Transport Police at the Lee County Landfill and that he approached\r\n  the officer before court about the ticket.Â  The officer declined to help,\r\n  citing as the reason that the legislator had complained about the officer\r\n  enforcing weight limits at the landfill.Â  Respondent called the legislator\r\n  about the officer's remark.Â  The legislator responded that the only thing he\r\n  had done was &quot;call somebody in Columbia&quot; about the weight tickets and\r\n  told them (presumably the State Transport police) that they could write tickets\r\n  anywhere in Lee County except at the entrance to the landfill.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges he was contacted\r\n  by a county official for help on weight ticket W223647 and that he contacted\r\n  the issuing officer.Â  The officer told respondent to contact his supervisor;\r\n  respondent contacted the officer's supervisor and the supervisor declined to\r\n  intervene. Â \r\nA State Transport police officer reported\r\n  that he was contacted by respondent about help on weight ticket W210437 which\r\n  had imposed a fine of $3,905.25.Â  The officer stated he told respondent he\r\n  could not help with the weight ticket, although he &quot;didn't care&quot; what\r\n  respondent &quot;did&quot; with the ticket.Â  Further, the officer reported that\r\n  respondent asked the ticket be marked &quot;not guilty&quot; and the officer\r\n  marked the ticket accordingly.Â  Respondent informed ODC that he did not ask the\r\n  officer for help on ticket W210437, but acknowledges that the trial officer's\r\n  copy of the ticket indicates he was the presiding judge.Â Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he\r\n  has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501,\r\n  SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity and independence of the\r\n  judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining,\r\n  and enforcing high standards of conduct and shall personally observe those\r\n  standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be\r\n  preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid\r\n    impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of the judgeâ€™s\r\n    activities); Canon 2A (judge\r\n      shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner\r\n      that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the\r\n      judiciary); Canon 2B (judge shall not allow social, political or other\r\n      relationships to influence the judge's judicial conduct or judgment; judge\r\n      shall not lend the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests\r\n      of the judge or others; judge shall not convey or permit others to convey the\r\n      impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge);Â Â Â Â Â \r\n      Canon 3 (judge shall\r\n        perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); and Canon\r\n        3(B)(7) (judge shall\r\n          not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications, or consider other communications\r\n            made toÂ  judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending or\r\n            impending proceeding). Â Respondent\r\n              also admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule\r\n              7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of\r\n              Judicial Conduct) of Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  have already condemned the practice of ticket-fixing or attempted ticket-fixing\r\n  by magistrates.Â  In the Matter of White, 374 S.C. 372, 650 S.E.2d 73\r\n  (2007); In the Matter of English, 367 S.C. 297, 625 S.E.2d 919 (2006); In\r\n    the Matter of Beckham, 365 S.C. 637, 620 S.E.2d 69 (2005).Â  Ticket-fixing\r\n  constitutes improper ex parte communication and severely undermines the\r\n  public's confidence in a fair and impartial judicial system.Â  Accordingly, again\r\n  we emphasize that it is improper for a magistrate to engage in ex parte\r\n  communications concerning any pending or impending judicial proceeding with an\r\n  officer, alleged violator, or any third party, including a member of the\r\n  legislature.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall not apply for, seek, or\r\n  accept any judicial position whatsoever in this State without the prior express\r\n  written authorization of this Court after due notice\r\n  in writing Â on ODC of any petition seeking the Courtâ€™s authorization.Â  Respondent\r\n  is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent resigned his magisterial position on October\r\n  16, 2009.Â  Since respondent no longer holds judicial office, a public reprimand\r\n  is the most severe sanction the Court can impose.Â  See In re Oâ€™Kelley,\r\n  361 S.C. 30, 603 S.E.2d 410 (2004); In re Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467\r\n  S.E.2d 924 (1996). \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26767","title":"In the Matter of Greenville County Magistrate James E.

Ashmore, PA, of Greenville.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule\r\n  502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the\r\n  imposition of any sanction up to a ninety (90) days suspension pursuant to Rule\r\n  7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and impose a ninety (90)\r\n  day suspension, retroactive to September 11, 2009, the date of respondent's\r\n  interim suspension.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent's clerk was arrested and\r\n  charged with forgery and embezzlement in excess of $5,000.00.Â  As a result, respondent\r\n  relied on another staff member to reconcile his civil and criminal accounts.Â  Respondent\r\n  believed the accounts were being properly reconciled. Respondent has since\r\n  learned the accounts were not properly reconciled in accordance with the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court's Orders on Financial Accounting.Â  In particular,\r\n  respondent learned that, on a number of occasions, the deposit slip totals and\r\n  daily deposit totals did not match, cash was removed from deposits and replaced\r\n  with checks, checks were not always included on the daily deposit slip, and\r\n  money and checks were not always promptly deposited.Â  When respondent became\r\n  aware of the financial discrepancies, he reported the matter for\r\n  investigation.Â  \r\nRespondent submits he believed the\r\n  reports were being properly reconciled because he was never contacted by anyone\r\n  from the Treasurer's Office or the County Finance Office about the reports.Â \r\n  Respondent is remorseful and realizes that, if he had taken a more pro-active\r\n  role in reviewing the documentation regarding his accounts, he might have\r\n  noticed the discrepancies sooner. Â Respondent submits that, in the future, he\r\n  will be more involved in seeing that his office properly complies with the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court's Orders on Financial Accounting.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he has\r\n  violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct:Â  \r\nCanon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of judicial\r\n    office diligently); Canon 3(C)(1) (judge shall diligently discharge his\r\n    administrative responsibilities without bias or prejudice and maintain\r\n    professional competence in judicial administration and should cooperate with\r\n    other judges and court officials in the administration of court business); and\r\n    Canon 3(C)(2) (judge shall require staff to observe the standards of fidelity\r\n    and diligence that apply to the judge).Â  By violating the Code of Judicial\r\n    Conduct, respondent admits he has violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for\r\n    Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants\r\n  a suspension from judicial office.Â  We therefore accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from his judicial duties for\r\n  ninety (90) days, retroactive to September 11, 2009, the date of his interim\r\n  suspension.Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26768","title":"Partain v.

Tessier, both of Wyche, Burgess, Freeman &amp;\r\n  Parham, of Greenville, and John C. Moylan, III, of Wyche, Burgess, Freeman\r\n  &amp; Parham, Â of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: Â In this case we consider whether a tort claim premised on an alleged &quot;bait and switch&quot;\r\n    is subject to an arbitration clause.Â  Because we find the alleged conduct was\r\n  not within the contemplation of the parties when they entered into the\r\n  agreement, we find that the arbitration clause does not apply and we reverse\r\n  the Court of Appeals opinion to the contrary.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  March 2006, Petitioner Amos Keith Partain met with Mikel Gadoran, an employee\r\n  of Respondent Upstate Automotive Group (Upstate Auto) and discussed the\r\n  purchase of a 2006 Nissan truck.Â  After negotiations over the sale price, Gadoran\r\n  phoned Partain and informed him that Gadoran's sales manager had authorized the\r\n  sale at Partain's offered price.Â  Shortly thereafter, Partain visited Upstate\r\n  Auto for a test drive.Â  Days later Partain received a phone call from Gadoran\r\n  telling him that he could come pick up the truck.\r\nPartain\r\n  returned to Upstate Auto where he completed paperwork and Upstate Auto\r\n  employees walked him through the &quot;vehicle introduction&quot; process with\r\n  a Nissan truck.Â  During the &quot;vehicle introduction&quot; Partain noticed\r\n  that a truck bed extension previously affixed to the truck was missing.Â \r\n  Upstate Auto employees explained that the extension had been removed but would\r\n  be reinserted.Â  Partain drove the truck home and eventually came to the\r\n  conclusion that the truck was not the same vehicle he had negotiated to buy or\r\n  taken for a test drive at Upstate Auto.\r\nPartain\r\n  filed suit against Upstate Auto alleging that he had been the victim of a &quot;bait\r\n  and switch&quot; in violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â \r\n  Consequently, Partain alleged he was entitled to three times his actual damages\r\n  plus interest, costs, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Upstate Auto asserted three\r\n  affirmative defenses in its Answer, including an arbitration agreement with\r\n  Partain.Â  Based on the arbitration agreement, Upstate Auto moved to dismiss\r\n  Partain's claim.Â  The circuit court denied Upstate Auto's Motion to Dismiss and\r\n  Motion for Reconsideration.Â Â  Upstate Auto appealed and the Court of Appeals\r\n  reversed.Â  Partain v. Upstate Automotive Group, 378 S.C. 152, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  426 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  This Court granted certiorari.Â  We now reverse the Court\r\n  of Appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe question of arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination unless the\r\n  parties provide otherwise.Â  See Zabinski v. Bright Acres Associates,\r\n  346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â  The determination whether a\r\n  claim is subject to arbitration is subject to de novo review.Â  See Gissel\r\n    v. Hart, 382 S.C. 235, 240, 676 S.E.2d 320, 323 (2009).Â  Nevertheless, a\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if any evidence\r\n  reasonably supports the findings.Â  See Aiken v. World Fin. Corp. of\r\n    South Carolina, 373 S.C. 144, 148, 644 S.E.2d 705, 707 (2007).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tPartain\r\n  raises the following issues on certiorari:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that a \r\n\t\t\t&quot;significant relationship&quot; exists between Partain's\r\n  Complaint and the contract between Partain and Upstate Auto?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that \r\n\t\t\tUpstate Auto's alleged conduct does not constitute &quot;illegal and \r\n\t\t\toutrageous acts&quot; unforeseeable to a reasonable consumer in the \r\n\t\t\tcontext of normal business dealings?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tI. \r\n\t\tDid the Court of Appeals\r\n  err in finding a &quot;significant relationship&quot; between Partain's claim\r\n  and the contract?\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  policy of the United States and of South Carolina is to favor arbitration of\r\n  disputes.Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  Unless a court\r\n  can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible\r\n  to any interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should generally be\r\n  ordered.Â  Aiken, 373 S.C. at 149, 644 S.E.2d at 708, citing Zabinski,\r\n  346 S.C. at 596-97, 553 S.E.2d at 118-19.Â  Regardless of the label the\r\n  plaintiff uses, when deciding whether an arbitration agreement encompasses a\r\n  dispute, a court must determine whether the factual allegations underlying the\r\n  claim are within the scope of the broad arbitration clause.Â  Zabinski,\r\n  346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  Moreover, even if the court finds that a\r\n  claim is outside of the scope of the arbitration clause, the clause may still\r\n  apply.Â  â€œA broadly-worded arbitration clause applies to disputes that do not\r\n  arise under the governing contract when a â€˜significant relationshipâ€™ exists\r\n  between the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is\r\n  contained.â€Â  Zabrinksi, 346 S.C. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119, citing Long\r\n    v. Silver, 248 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2001).Â  Thus, a claim falls within the\r\n  scope of an arbitration clause if it is encompassed by the language of the\r\n  clause or if a &quot;significant relationship&quot; exists between the claim\r\n  and the contract.\r\nApparently,\r\n  the Court of Appeals found that the claim is not within the scope of the\r\n  arbitration agreement as it proceeded directly to finding a â€œsignificant\r\n  relationshipâ€ between Partainâ€™s claim and the contract.Â  Because we find that\r\n  the factual allegations underlying Partain's claim are encompassed by the terms\r\n  of the arbitration clause, we need not reach the &quot;significant\r\n  relationship&quot; question.Â  Nevertheless, while we disagree with the\r\n  reasoning of the Court of Appeals, we agree that, at least on its face, the\r\n  arbitration clause applies.\r\nThe\r\n  arbitration clause in the contract for sale between Partain and Upstate Auto\r\n  provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tBuyer/Lessee acknowledges and agrees that all claims,\r\n  demands, disputes, or controversies of every kind or nature that may arise\r\n  between them concerning any of the negotiations leading to the sale, lease or\r\n  financing of the vehicle terms and provisions of the sale, lease or financing\r\n  shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted pursuant to the provision[s]\r\n  of 9 U.S.C. section 1, et. [s]eq. and according to the Commerical Rules of the\r\n  American Arbitration Association[.] Without limiting the generality of the\r\n  forgoing, it is the intention of the buyer/lessee and the dealer to resolve by\r\n  binding arbitration all disputes between them concerning the vehicle its sale,\r\n  lease or financing and its condition including disputes concerning the terms\r\n  and condition of the sale, lease or financing, the condition of the vehicle,\r\n  any damage to the vehicle, the terms and meaning of any of the documents signed\r\n  or given in connection with the sale, lease or financing, any representations,\r\n  promises, or omissions made in connection with the negotiations for the sale,\r\n  lease or financing, credit life insurance, disability insurance and vehicle\r\n  extended warranty or service contract purchased or obtained in connection with\r\n  the vehicle.\r\n\r\nPartain's\r\n  complaint alleges that, upon completion of the sale, Upstate Auto presented a\r\n  truck to him that &quot;was not the same truck that [Partain] had test driven .\r\n  . . and was not the same truck that he had negotiated to buy . . . .&quot;Â  His\r\n  claim is therefore encompassed by the following language: &quot;Buyer/Lessee\r\n  acknowledges and agrees that all claims, demands, disputes, or controversies of\r\n  every kind or nature that may arise between them concerning any of the\r\n  negotiations leading to the sale . . . of the vehicle and provisions of the\r\n  sale . . . shall be settled by binding arbitration . . . .&quot;Â  Consequently,\r\n  the factual allegations underlying Partain's claim fall within the language of\r\n  the arbitration clause and the Court of Appeals did not err in finding a\r\n  &quot;significant relationship&quot; between the contract and Partain's claim.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tII. \r\n\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that Upstate \r\n\t\tAuto's alleged conduct does not constitute &quot;illegal and outrageous acts&quot; \r\n\t\tunforeseeable to a reasonable consumer in the context of normal business \r\n\t\tdealings?\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPartain\r\n  argues that even if his claim is encompassed by language of the arbitration\r\n  clause, the clause does not apply because the alleged actions of Upstate Auto constitute\r\n  &quot;illegal and outrageous acts&quot; unforeseeable to a reasonable consumer\r\n  in the context of normal business dealings.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Aiken,\r\n  a majority of this Court noted that, &quot;[b]ecause even the most\r\n  broadly-worded arbitration agreements still have limits founded in general\r\n  principles of contract law, this Court will refuse to interpret any arbitration\r\n  agreement as applying to outrageous torts that are unforeseeable to a\r\n  reasonable consumer in the context of normal business dealings.&quot;Â  Aiken,\r\n  373 S.C. at 151, 644 S.E.2d at 709.Â  The Court provided that it did not seek to\r\n  exclude all intentional torts from the scope of arbitration, but only &quot;those\r\n  outrageous torts, which although factually related to the performance of the\r\n  contract, are legally distinct from the contractual relationship between the\r\n  parties.&quot;Â  Id. at 152, 644 S.E.2d at 709.Â  After all, arbitration\r\n  is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration\r\n  any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.Â  Aiken, 373 S.C. at 149,\r\n  644 S.E.2d at 708, citing Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596-97, 553 S.E.2d at\r\n  118-19.\r\nAiken involved a tort action based on the theft of the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s personal information by employees of a consumer finance company.Â  Id. at 146, 644 S.E.2d at 706.Â  The company sought to enforce a broadly-worded\r\n  arbitration clause to which plaintiff had agreed in applying for a loan.Â  Id. at 147, 644 S.E.2d at 707.Â  The plaintiff submitted the information in applying\r\n  for loans and paid off the last of the loans in 2000.Â  Id. at 146, 644\r\n  S.E.2d at 707.Â Â Â  The misuse forming the basis for the claim occurred over two\r\n  years later.Â  Id. at 147, 644 S.E.2d at 707.Â  This Court held that the\r\n  theft of personal information was &quot;outrageous conduct that [plaintiff]\r\n  could not possibly have foreseen when he agreed to do business with [finance\r\n  company].&quot;Â  Id. at 151, 644 S.E.2d at 709.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  plaintiff could not have intended to submit the dispute to arbitration.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find this case is controlled by Aiken.Â Â  Partain cannot be held to have foreseen\r\n  that Upstate Auto, after completing a sale, would substitute an entirely\r\n  different vehicle in place of the truck he had agreed to purchase.[1]Â \r\n  Moreover, Partain cannot be held to have contemplated that, in signing the\r\n  arbitration clause, he was agreeing to arbitrate claims arising from allegedly fraudulent\r\n  conduct.Â  We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals holding that the\r\n  conduct alleged by Partain does not meet the Aiken standard.\r\nWe\r\n  emphasize that this case should not be read as providing an &quot;end-run&quot;\r\n  around arbitration clauses.Â  Where parties have contractually agreed to\r\n  arbitrate a claim, a party may not escape its commitment simply by presenting\r\n  his claim as a tort.Â  Only where the claim presented was clearly not within the\r\n  contemplation of the parties will a court decline to enforce an otherwise\r\n  proper arbitration agreement.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThough\r\n  the terms of the arbitration clause may be interpreted to encompass Partain's\r\n  claim we find that the parties did not intend to submit the alleged &quot;bait and\r\n  switch&quot; to arbitration.Â  We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice\r\n  James E.

Zelenka, all of Columbia, and\r\n  Solicitor Robert Mills Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â Â  In this capital murder case, Charles Christopher\r\n  Williams (Appellant) appeals his sentence of death.Â  Appellant argues (1) that\r\n  once the jury disclosed its numerical division it was incumbent upon the trial\r\n  judge to declare a mistrial; (2) that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 required the\r\n  trial court to sentence Appellant to a life sentence because the jury could not\r\n  agree on a sentence after â€œreasonable deliberation;â€ (3) the trial judge committed\r\n  error by issuing a coercive Allen charge; and (4) the trial judge erred\r\n  in refusing to declare a mistrial when a forensic psychiatristâ€™s testimony\r\n  impermissibly bolstered and vouched for the solicitorâ€™s decision to seek the\r\n  death penalty.Â  We disagree.[1]\r\nFacts/Procedural History\r\nAround\r\n  10:00 a.m. on September 3, 2003, Appellant entered a Bi-Lo grocery store in\r\n  Greenville where his former girlfriend, Maranda Williams (Victim), worked.Â \r\n  Appellant accosted Victim and forced her into an office in the bakery/deli.Â  Victim\r\n  called 911 from her cell phone.Â  During the ninety-minute phone call, hostage\r\n  negotiators tried to convince Appellant to release Victim.Â  When Victim\r\n  attempted to escape Appellant chased, shot, and killed her.Â  Hearing the shots,\r\n  law enforcement entered the store and apprehended Appellant.Â  Shortly after his\r\n  arrest, Appellant gave a statement in which he confessed to the crimes for\r\n  which he was later charged.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  was tried and found guilty of murder, kidnapping, and possession of a firearm\r\n  during the commission of a violent crime.Â  During the sentencing phase of the\r\n  trial, the State sought to establish two statutory aggravating circumstances:\r\n  (1) the murder was committed while in the commission of kidnapping; and (2) the\r\n  offender by his act of murder knowingly created a great risk of death to more\r\n  than one person in a public place by means of a weapon. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(b), (C)(a)(3) (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007).Â  As its primary\r\n  witness, the State called Dr. Pamela Crawford.Â  Dr. Crawford testified that she\r\n  was associated with SLED and called by the Greenville County Solicitorâ€™s Office\r\n  within an hour and fifteen minutes of the crime to â€œprovide assistance.â€[2] \r\nDefense\r\n  counsel objected to Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony and argued that it amounted to\r\n  expert testimony.Â  The trial judge sustained the objection and gave a curative\r\n  instruction telling the jury to disregard anything Dr. Crawford said about the\r\n  death penalty.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  solicitor resumed his questioning of Dr. Crawford and asked, â€œ[w]as the purpose\r\n  of you interviewing the defendant to provide information to me in consideration\r\n  of whether or not - - -.â€Â  Before the solicitor could finish the question,\r\n  defense counsel again objected and the jury was sent out of the courtroom.Â \r\n  Defense counsel renewed his objection and emphasized that Dr. Crawford had not\r\n  been qualified as an expert but was giving testimony that she assisted the\r\n  solicitor in whether to seek the death penalty.Â  Defense counsel then moved to\r\n  have Dr. Crawford excused as a witness.Â  The solicitor stated he would withdraw\r\n  the question.Â  Defense counsel explained he believed the jury would think that\r\n  the defense was hiding relevant evidence by objecting to Dr. Crawfordâ€™s\r\n  testimony.Â  Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial.Â  The trial judge\r\n  reminded defense counsel that the question was withdrawn, but defense counsel\r\n  responded with a demand for a mistrial.\r\nThe\r\n  Court denied the motion for a mistrial.Â  After a lunch break, Dr. Crawford was\r\n  called back to the stand and defense counsel renewed the motion for a\r\n  mistrial.Â  The judge gave a curative instruction in which he told the jury that\r\n  Dr. Crawford had not been qualified as an expert.Â  Dr. Crawford then resumed\r\n  her testimony.Â Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Crawford testified that she interviewed Appellant for several hours at the\r\n  Greenville County Law Enforcement Center.[3]Â  According to Dr. Crawford, the primary purpose of\r\n  this interview was to understand Appellantâ€™s state of mind at the time of the\r\n  crime.Â  At the outset of the interview, Dr. Crawford informed Appellant she was\r\n  a forensic psychiatrist who worked for SLED and the solicitorâ€™s office, and any\r\n  information she obtained could be used in court.Â  Dr. Crawford also emphasized\r\n  to Appellant that she was not his treating psychiatrist but would refer him to\r\n  someone if she felt he needed treatment.Â  Although Appellant was not very\r\n  expressive during the interview, Dr. Crawford testified that Appellant was\r\n  coherent and characterized his demeanor as calm, pleasant, and cooperative.Â \r\n  During the interview, Appellant again confessed to murdering Victim and\r\n  explained his feelings and the events leading up to the crime.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  motions, closing arguments, and charges, the jury deliberated from 3:50 p.m. to\r\n  7:00 p.m. on Friday, February 18, 2005.Â  The jury resumed deliberations the\r\n  next morning at 9:30.Â  Shortly before 11:55 a.m., the foreman sent the trial judge\r\n  a note which stated: â€œ[the] jury is at 9 for death imposition, 3 for life\r\n  imprisonment.Â  Please refer to instruction about what procedure to follow to\r\n  resolve.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  judge, out of the presence of the jury, indicated that he intended to give an Allen charge.[4]Â  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial arguing that\r\n  because the jury indicated its division as to a life versus death sentence the\r\n  judge was required to end the juryâ€™s deliberations and impose a sentence of\r\n  life without parole.Â  The solicitor disagreed, noting the jury had voluntarily\r\n  revealed its voting division, thus the judge was not required to impose a\r\n  sentence of life imprisonment.Â  \r\nDefense\r\n  counsel made a motion for a mistrial, motion to sentence Appellant to life\r\n  imprisonment, and a motion to charge the defenseâ€™s proposed Allen instruction.Â  The trial judge denied all of defense counselâ€™s motions.Â  The trial\r\n  judge then informed counsel that he intended to give the jury an Allen charge and would instruct them to continue their deliberations.\r\nAfter\r\n  the judge issued an Allen charge, the jury resumed deliberations at\r\n  12:02 p.m.Â  At 3:45 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom after indicating\r\n  they had reached a verdict.Â  The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the\r\n  murder was committed while in the commission of a kidnapping, and the jury\r\n  recommended Appellant be sentenced to death.Â  The trial judge then sentenced Appellant\r\n  to death.[5]\r\nStandard of Review\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. We are\r\n  bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.â€ Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C.\r\n  1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (citations omitted).Â  â€œThis Court does not\r\n  re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by\r\n  any evidence.â€Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  â€œThe admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose\r\n  decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Saltz,&nbsp;346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244&nbsp;(2001).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Juryâ€™s Disclosure of Vote\r\n  Division\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in declining to\r\n  sentence him to life imprisonment when the jury, by its written note, revealed\r\n  it was divided nine to three in favor of death.Â  Appellant contends that under\r\n  these â€œunusual circumstancesâ€ giving the jury an Allen charge was\r\n  impractical and coercive against the minority faction of the jury that opposed\r\n  the death penalty.Â  Ultimately, Appellant argues that once the jury disclosed\r\n  its numerical division it was incumbent upon the trial judge to declare a\r\n  mistrial.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â  \r\nAs\r\n  a threshold matter, â€œ[n]either the Due Process clause nor the Eighth Amendment\r\n  forbid the giving of an Allen charge in the sentencing phase of a\r\n  capital proceeding.â€Â  Tucker v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 483, 490, 552 S.E.2d\r\n  712, 716 (2001) (citing Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988); Jones\r\n    v. United States, 527 U.S. 373 (1999)).Â  â€œThe typical judicial mechanism\r\n  for encouraging an indecisive jury is the Allen charge, in which jurors\r\n  are instructed on, among other things, their duties to approach the evidence\r\n  with an open mind and consider the opinions of their fellow jurors.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Robinson, 360 S.C. 187, 193, 600 S.E.2d 100, 103 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nWe\r\n  find the trial judgeâ€™s issuance of an Allen charge was not improper.Â \r\n  Initially, we agree with Appellant that it is improper for a trial judge to\r\n  inquire into the numerical division of a jury.Â  See State v.\r\n    Middleton, 218 S.C. 452, 457, 63 S.E.2d 163, 165 (1951); Lowenfield,\r\n  484 U.S. at 239-40 Brasfield v. United States, 272 U.S. 448, 450\r\n  (1926).Â Â Â Â  However, these decisions are inapplicable in the instant case\r\n  because the jury here voluntarily disclosed its numerical division and\r\n  requested further instructions on how to proceed.Â  The judge then promptly\r\n  informed the attorneys of the jurorsâ€™ numerical division and indicated that he\r\n  could give an Allen charge.Â  Unlike other cases, the trial judge did not\r\n  inquire about the specifics of the juryâ€™s impasse.Â  See United States\r\n    v. Brokemond, 959 F.2d 206, 209 (11th Cir. 1992) (â€œUnsolicited disclosure\r\n  of the juryâ€™s division by a juror is not by itself grounds for a mistrial.â€).Â \r\n  Therefore, we hold the trial judge committed no error in not declaring a\r\n  mistrial and giving an Allen charge after the jury revealed it was\r\n  divided nine to three in favor of death.\r\nII.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20\r\nAppellant argues that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20\r\n  required the trial court to sentence Appellant to a life sentence because the\r\n  jury could not agree on a sentence after â€œreasonable deliberation.â€Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\tSection 16-3-20\r\n  provides in pertinent part:\r\n\tIf members of\r\n  the jury after a reasonable deliberation cannot agree on a recommendation as to\r\n  whether or not the death sentence should be imposed on a defendant found guilty\r\n  of murder, the trial judge shall dismiss such jury and shall sentence the\r\n  defendant to life imprisonment as provided in subsection (A).\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C) (2003).Â  A review of the pertinent statutory language in\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C) reveals the analysis of this issue is dependent\r\n  upon an interpretation of â€œreasonable deliberation.â€ Â Given the subjective\r\n  nature of this term, this Court has been reluctant to define as a matter of law\r\n  what constitutes â€œreasonable deliberationâ€ sufficient to end the juryâ€™s\r\n  deliberations and impose a life sentence. Â We note that â€œâ€˜reasonable\r\n  deliberationâ€™ is not simply an elapsed-time dependent determination,â€ but\r\n  rather is an issue â€œcommitted to the trial judgeâ€™s discretion.â€Â  Tucker,\r\n  346 S.C. at 489-90, 552 S.E.2d at 715.\r\nAlthough we have not precisely defined â€œreasonable\r\n  deliberation,â€ our previous decisions make clear that here the trial judge did\r\n  not abuse his discretion in permitting the jury to resume deliberations.Â  In Tucker,\r\n  this Court refused to determine as a matter of law that the jury had engaged in\r\n  â€œreasonable deliberationâ€ sufficient to require the trial judge to impose a\r\n  life sentence.Â  Id. at 490, 552 S.E.2d at 716.Â  We found that the jury\r\n  deliberated for a substantial period of time before informing the judge it was\r\n  â€œhopelessly deadlocked,â€ and that the jury took its responsibility seriously,\r\n  diligently working to reach a verdict.Â  Id. at 490, 552 S.E.2d at 715.Â \r\n  Under those circumstances, had the â€œreasonable deliberationâ€ issue been raised\r\n  to him, the trial judge in his discretion â€œmay or may not have found the jury\r\n  had engaged in â€˜reasonable deliberation.â€™â€Â  Id. at 490, 552 S.E.2d at\r\n  716.Â  \r\nHere, the jury only deliberated about a lengthy\r\n  capital murder trial for approximately five hours and thirty-five minutes\r\n  before sending the note to the judge.Â  However, unlike the jury in Tucker,\r\n  this jury did not indicate it was deadlocked, but rather requested additional\r\n  instructions to resolve their impasse.Â  Cf. State v. Robinson, 360 S.C.\r\n  187, 193-94, 600 S.E.2d 100, 103 (Ct. App. 2004) (concluding mistrial should\r\n  have been granted after jury indicated it was again deadlocked after receiving Allen charge and that additional deliberation would not break deadlock).Â  Thus, the\r\n  juryâ€™s request was an indication that the jurors had not given up on reaching a\r\n  verdict and that they anticipated further deliberations.Â  Accordingly, we hold\r\n  the trial judge properly permitted the jury to resume its deliberations and\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 did not mandate a sentence of life imprisonment.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Allen Charge Not Coercive\r\nAlternatively,\r\n  Appellant argues that the trial judgeâ€™s Allen charge was unconstitutionally\r\n  coercive.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBecause we find the trial judge properly charged\r\n  Appellantâ€™s jury with an Allen charge, the question before us is whether\r\n  the charge was coercive.Â  â€œWhether an Allen charge is unconstitutionally\r\n  coercive must be judged â€˜in its context and under all the circumstances.â€™â€Â  Tucker,\r\n  346 S.C. at 490, 552 S.E.2d at 716 (quoting Lowenfield, 484 U.S. at\r\n  237).Â  This Court has explained:Â Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn South Carolina state courts, an Allen charge\r\n  cannot be directed to the minority voters on the jury panel.Â  Instead, an Allen charge should be even-handed, directing both the majority and the minority to\r\n  consider the otherâ€™s views.Â  A trial judge has a duty to urge, but not coerce,\r\n  a jury to reach a verdict.Â  It is not coercion to charge every juror has a\r\n  right to his own opinion and need not give up the opinion merely to reach a\r\n  verdict.Â  \r\n\r\nGreen\r\n  v. State, 351 S.C. 184, 194, 569\r\n  S.E.2d 318, 323 (2002) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn Tucker, we adopted the standard set by the United States Supreme Court\r\n  in Lowenfield to determine whether an Allen charge is\r\n  unconstitutionally coercive.Â  In Lowenfield, the Supreme Court set forth\r\n  the following factors to be considered:\r\n\r\n\t(1) the charge did not speak specifically to the\r\n  minority juror(s);Â Â  \r\n\t(2) the judge did not include in his charge any\r\n  language such as â€œYou have got to reach a decision in this case;â€\r\n\t(3) there was no inquiry into the juryâ€™s numerical\r\n  division, which is generally coercive; and\r\n\t(4) while the jury returned a verdict shortly after\r\n  the supplemental charge, which suggests a possibility of coercion, weighing\r\n  against this is the fact that trial counsel did not object either to the\r\n  inquiry into whether the jurors believed further deliberation would result in a\r\n  verdict, nor to the supplemental charge.\r\n\r\nTucker, 346 S.C. at 492, 552 S.E.2d at 716 (citing Lowenfield,\r\n  484 U.S. at 237).Â Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  these factors, we found the Allen charge in Tucker was\r\n  unconstitutionally coercive.Â  Id. at 494, 552 S.E.2d at 718.Â \r\n  Specifically, this Court concluded: (1) viewed as a whole, the jury charge was\r\n  directed to the minority juror; (2) Tuckerâ€™s jury was told of the importance of\r\n  a unanimous verdict; (3) even though the jury informed the trial judge of their\r\n  numerical split, the judge failed to instruct the jurors not to disclose their\r\n  division in the future; and (4) Tuckerâ€™s jury returned a verdict approximately\r\n  an hour and a half after receiving the Allen charge.Â  Id. at\r\n  492-94, 552 S.E.2d at 717-18.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, defense counsel took exception to the judgeâ€™s Allen charge on\r\n  the ground that it deviated from counselâ€™s proposed instruction. Â Defense\r\n  counselâ€™s proposed Allen charge stated:Â  \r\n\r\n\tBy law I cannot tell you where to go from here, but I\r\n  suggest that you continue deliberations in an attempt to reach a verdict.Â  I\r\n  can tell you that each of you have a duty to consult with one another and to\r\n  deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement that does not do violence to\r\n  any one of your individual judgments.Â  Each of you as jurors must decide the\r\n  case for yourself after impartial consideration of the evidence with your\r\n  fellow jurors.Â  During the course of your continued deliberations each of you\r\n  should not hesitate to re-examine your own views and change your opinion if\r\n  convinced that your opinion is erroneous.Â  Each juror who finds himself or\r\n  herself to be in the minority should consider their views in light of the\r\n  opinions of the jurors of the majority.Â  Those in the majority must consider\r\n  their views in light of the minority.Â  No juror should surrender their honest\r\n  conviction for the mere purpose of returning a unanimous verdict.Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn response to defense counselâ€™s exceptions, the trial\r\n  court noted that the charge issued covered â€œbasically the same thingâ€ as the\r\n  submitted Allen charge.Â  The trial judge also referenced counselâ€™s\r\n  concern that the jury be instructed that they should not surrender their\r\n  convictions just to get a unanimous vote. Â The trial judge read the following\r\n  portion of his original charge: â€œLadies and gentlemen, you have stated you are\r\n  unable to agree on a verdict in this case.Â  As I instructed you earlier, the\r\n  verdict of a jury must be unanimous.â€Â  The judge then stated, â€œI am not going\r\n  to charge that.Â  Iâ€™m taking that sentence out.â€Â  The trial judge then\r\n  instructed the jury:\r\n\r\n\tMr. Foreman, Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, youâ€™ve\r\n  stated youâ€™ve been unable to reach a verdict in this case.Â  When a matter is in\r\n  dispute, it isnâ€™t always easy for even two people to agree.Â  So, when 12 people\r\n  must agree, it becomes even more difficult.Â  In most cases absolute certainty\r\n  cannot be reached or expected.Â  You should consult with one another, express\r\n  your own views, and listen to the opinions of your fellow jurors.Â  Tell each\r\n  other how you feel and why you feel that way.Â  Discuss your differences with\r\n  open minds.Â  Therefore, to some degree it can be said jury service is a matter\r\n  of give and take.\r\n\tEvery one of you has the right to your own opinion,\r\n  the verdict you agree to must be your own verdict, a result of your own\r\n  convictions.Â  You should not give up your firmly held beliefs merely to be in\r\n  agreement with your fellow jurors.Â  The minority should consider the majorityâ€™s\r\n  opinion and the majority should consider the minorityâ€™s opinion.Â  You should\r\n  carefully consider and respect the opinions of each other and evaluate your\r\n  position for reasonableness, correctness, and partiality.Â  You must lay aside\r\n  all outside matters and reexamine the question before you base[d] [on] the law\r\n  and the evidence in this case.Â  \r\n\tI, therefore, ask you to return to your deliberations\r\n  with the hope that you can arrive at a verdict.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nDefense\r\n  counsel again objected to the trial judgeâ€™s charge.Â  Relying on this Courtâ€™s\r\n  opinion in State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999),[6] counsel claimed that his proposed charge\r\n  â€œspecifically identifies to the jurors that they have the right and\r\n  specifically essentially an obligation to deal with their own views in this\r\n  case and not to agree simply to agree.â€Â  The trial judge denied counselâ€™s\r\n  motion and explained that his charge covered defense counselâ€™s concern by\r\n  charging the jury to maintain their own convictions.Â  Â Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  find the Allen charge in the instant case was not coercive.Â  First,\r\n  unlike Tucker, the charge was not directed at the minority jurors.Â \r\n  Instead, it evenly addressed both the majority and minority jurors and urged\r\n  them to consider each otherâ€™s views.Â  See Green, 351 S.C. at 195, 569\r\n  S.E.2d at 323-24 (finding Allen charge was not coercive and did not\r\n  focus on the position of the minority juror).Â  Second, the trial judgeâ€™s charge\r\n  did not include language such as â€œYou have got to reach a decision in this\r\n  case.â€Â  Rather, the charge instructed the jurors to resume their deliberations\r\n  â€œwith the hope you can arrive at a verdict.â€Â  Third, there was no inquiry into\r\n  the juryâ€™s numerical division.Â  Here, without solicitation the jury disclosed\r\n  its numerical division to the trial judge who then informed the trial\r\n  attorneys.Â  In contrast to Tucker where there was one holdout juror, the\r\n  judge here did not direct his Allen charge to the three minority jurors\r\n  despite his knowledge of the juryâ€™s numerical split.Â  Finally, the jury\r\n  deliberated for approximately three hours and forty-five minutes after being\r\n  given the Allen charge, which was significantly longer than the Tucker jury.Â  We believe the extended deliberations would appear to weigh against any\r\n  allegation that the charge was coercive.\r\nViewing\r\n  the Allen charge in the context of the specific circumstances of the\r\n  case, we find it was not coercive.[7]Â  Furthermore, a careful review of the trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  charge compared with defense counselâ€™s proposed charge reveals the charge was a\r\n  correct statement of the law and covered the substance of defense counselâ€™s\r\n  proposed charge.Â  See State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 458, 385\r\n  S.E.2d 830, 831 (1989) (stating, â€œ[I]f the trial judge refuses to give a\r\n  specific charge, there is no error if the charge actually given sufficiently\r\n  covers the substance of the request.â€).\r\nIV.&nbsp; Dr. Crawfordâ€™s Testimony\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial judge erred in refusing to declare a mistrial because Dr.\r\n  Crawfordâ€™s testimony impermissibly bolstered and vouched for the solicitorâ€™s decision\r\n  to seek the death penalty.[8]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nWe find that there was nothing improper about the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s examination of Dr. Crawford as a lay witness.Â  Furthermore, to the\r\n  extent there was any confusion among the jurors regarding Dr. Crawfordâ€™s role\r\n  as a lay witness, such confusion was effectively cured by the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  instruction to the jury.Â  \r\nDr. Crawford was introduced to give fact testimony\r\n  regarding her observation of Appellantâ€™s mental state within hours of Victimâ€™s\r\n  murder.Â  We have long held that a lay witness may testify as to a defendantâ€™s\r\n  mental state.Â  See State\r\n    v. Rimert, 315 S.C. 527, 446 S.E.2d 400 (1994), cert.\r\n      denied, 513 U.S. 1080 (1995) (where the State relied on lay testimony to\r\n  establish defendantâ€™s sanity); State v. Smith, 298 S.C. 205, 379 S.E.2d\r\n  287 (1989) (holding that where defendant presents expert testimony regarding\r\n  his insanity, the State may introduce lay testimony in rebuttal).Â  Â Â \r\nWe recognize that while a witness of Dr. Crawfordâ€™s\r\n  professional expertise may in many cases be called upon to deliver expert\r\n  testimony, the solicitor was not bound to call her in that capacity so long as\r\n  her testimony was limited to lay matters.Â  The solicitor was justified in\r\n  asking Dr. Crawford to observe Appellantâ€™s mental state subsequent to his\r\n  arrest and in calling upon her to testify regarding her observations.Â \r\n  Appellant had been duly informed of his rights under Miranda, and spoke\r\n  with Dr. Crawford voluntarily.Â  Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony was reasonably limited\r\n  to her factual observations over the course of the interview.Â  In our view, Dr.\r\n  Crawford was called as a lay witness to give lay testimony.Â  There is no\r\n  indication in the record that the juryâ€™s responsibility for determining Appellantâ€™s\r\n  fate was diminished in any way by the solicitorâ€™s questioning of Dr. Crawford.Â  \r\nEven if Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony was improper, any\r\n  prejudice was cured by the jury instruction.Â  Therefore, we find no error in the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s denial of Appellantâ€™s motion for mistrial.\r\nProportionality Review\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003), we\r\n  have conducted a proportionality review and find the death\r\n  sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\r\n  factor.Â  Furthermore, a review of other decisions demonstrates that Appellantâ€™s\r\n  sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate. Â See, e.g., State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260&nbsp;(1996).Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold (1) the trial judge\r\n  committed no error in not declaring a mistrial and giving an Allen charge after the jury revealed it was divided nine to three in favor of death; (2)\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 did not mandate a sentence of life imprisonment; (3) the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s Allen charge was not coercive; and (4) the trial judge committed\r\n  no error in refusing to declare a mistrial based on Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony.Â \r\n  The conviction and sentence below are therefore affirmed.Â  \r\nWALLER, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  KITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  concurring except for Part IV in which he concurs in result only.Â  PLEICONES,\r\n  J., concurring in a separate opinion.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm here,\r\n  but write separately to express my disagreement with Part IV of the majorityâ€™s\r\n  opinion.Â  In my opinion, whether the trial judge committed an abuse of\r\n  discretion in denying appellantâ€™s mistrial motion following improper questioning\r\n  by the solicitor is not preserved for our review.\r\nThe sole issue\r\n  regarding Dr. Crawford before the Court at this juncture is whether the trial\r\n  judge should have granted a mistrial because of Dr. Crawfordâ€™s penalty phase\r\n  testimony.Â  To explain why I do not believe this issue is preserved, I will\r\n  quote liberally from the penalty phase transcript of the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  questioning of Dr. Crawford:\r\n\r\n\tSolicitor:Â  And your employment with the Department of\r\n  Mental Health is as what?\r\n\tAnswer:Â Â Â  A forensic psychiatrist.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSolicitor: \r\n\t\t\tAnd, now, back on September the 3rd, did \r\n\t\t\tyou have occasion at my request to come to Greenville, South \r\n\t\t\tCarolina?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAnswer:Â Â Â  Yes, I did.\r\n\tSolicitor:Â  As an employee of the Department of Mental\r\n  Health?\r\n\tAnswer:Â  Thatâ€™s correct.\r\n\tSolicitor:Â  And were you also in any way connected\r\n  with any other state agency at that time?\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAnswer: \r\n\t\t\tYes.&nbsp; The Department of Mental Health had what \r\n\t\t\twe call a memorandum of agreement with SLED, South Carolina Law \r\n\t\t\tEnforcement Division, where I was the consultant forensic \r\n\t\t\tpsychiatrist for SLED.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSolicitor:\r\n\t\t\tExplain to the jury prior to September the 3rd \r\n\t\t\tof 2003, what the working relationship you had either with my office \r\n\t\t\tor other solicitors.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAnswer: \r\n\t\t\tThis was all through my work with Department of \r\n\t\t\tMental Health, through the memorandum of agreement with SLED.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI would do a variety of things.&nbsp; Some of the things I would do, \r\n\t\t\tfor example, go on SWAT calls and assist with negotiations.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tBut as far as your office and the solicitorâ€™s office is concerned, I \r\n\t\t\twould be called by a solicitor if, for example, there was some kind \r\n\t\t\tof alleged crime of significant magnitude.&nbsp; And they would call \r\n\t\t\tme and ask me to come and provide assistance.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSolicitor:Â  All right.Â  What type of assistance in\r\n  particular did I request from you in this particular case on September the 3rd?\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAnswer: \r\n\t\t\tIn this particular case, and again Iâ€™m called by \r\n\t\t\tvarious solicitors throughout the state, and Iâ€™m only called when \r\n\t\t\titâ€™s a case of a very severe nature.&nbsp; And typically itâ€™s when \r\n\t\t\tthe death penalty may be considered.&nbsp; And Iâ€™m asked to assess -\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMr. Nettles:Â  Objection.Â  And Iâ€™m going to ask the\r\n  jury be sent out.\r\n\tThe Court:Â  Mr. foreman, members of the jury donâ€™t\r\n  discuss the case.Â  Iâ€™ll get you back very shortly.\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  an in camera discussion, the judge gave the following curative\r\n  instruction, without objection from appellant, and the questioning continued:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe Court:\r\n\t\t\tMr. foreman, ladies and gentlemen of the jury \r\n\t\t\tplease disregard anything that she said that she may be asked to \r\n\t\t\tassess concerning the death penalty.&nbsp; Disregard that.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThatâ€™s not appropriate.&nbsp; Weâ€™re not going there. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tSolicitor.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSolicitor: \r\n\t\t\tLet me clarify and go back.Â  We were\r\n  talking about what you had come to Greenville for.Â  And as a result of coming\r\n  to Greenville, did you in fact interview the defendant?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAnswer:Â Â Â &nbsp; Yes, I did.\r\n\tSolicitor:Â &nbsp;&nbsp; What was the purpose of you interviewing -\r\n\tMr. Nettles:Â Objection.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe Court:\r\n\t\t\tHold on a second.&nbsp; Solicitor, you may lead her \r\n\t\t\tthrough these questions, please, sir, laying your foundation.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYou may lead her.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tMr. Ariail: \r\n\t\t\tWas the purpose of you interviewing the\r\n  defendant to provide that information to me in consideration of whether or not\r\n  -\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMr. Nettles:Â Objection.Â  And Iâ€™m going to -\r\n\tThe Court:Â &nbsp; Hold on.Â  Donâ€™t get into the facts.Â  Come\r\n  on up here for a second, both of you.\r\n\tÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (bench conference held within the\r\n  presence but outside the hearing of the jury.)\r\n\tThe Court:Â  Mr. foreman, ladies and gentlemen, go to\r\n  the jury room.Â  Donâ€™t discuss the case please.\r\n\r\nDuring\r\n  the ensuing in camera discussion, the solicitor agreed to withdraw the\r\n  question.Â  One of appellantâ€™s attorneys requested a curative instruction, and\r\n  was given an opportunity to write one for the trial judgeâ€™s use.Â  While that\r\n  charge was being written, appellantâ€™s other attorney argued for a mistrial.[9]Â  The judge denied the mistrial request, but gave the\r\n  solicitor and Dr. Crawford strict instructions on the limits of permissible\r\n  questions and answers.Â  Following that, appellant renewed his mistrial motion.Â \r\n  When the jury returned, they were given this curative instruction:\r\n\r\n\tThe Court:Â  Mr. foreman, members of the jury, I told\r\n  you this in the first phase of the trial.Â  Iâ€™m going to tell you again.Â \r\n  Whenever one of the attorneys makes an objection, theyâ€™re merely telling the\r\n  court that they do not think thatâ€™s admissible under the rules of evidence or\r\n  the rules of court.Â  And itâ€™s my job to decide whether itâ€™s admissible or not\r\n  admissible.Â  I ask you to leave the courtroom so I can comment on the facts,\r\n  because Iâ€™m not at liberty to comment on the facts when the jury is present.\r\n\tIâ€™m the one that asked\r\n  you to leave the courtroom so I can be free with what I say to the attorneys\r\n  and the questions I ask the attorneys.Â  The attorneys are not trying to hide\r\n  anything, they just have an opinion itâ€™s not admissible, and thatâ€™s their job.Â \r\n  You are not to consider anything for or against either one of the attorneys\r\n  when they make objections as to the rules of evidence.Â  Thatâ€™s the procedure we\r\n  are going through, and thatâ€™s the reason Iâ€™ve been running you in and out of\r\n  the courtroom, so I would be free, not that the attorneys are hiding anything.Â \r\n  You understand?\r\n\tAll right.Â  Now, normally\r\n  opinions are not given in a courtroom.Â  However, opinions may be given in a\r\n  courtroom by laypersons when theyâ€™re based on the perceptions of a witness,\r\n  such as, if someone is staggering and you smell alcohol on their breath, you\r\n  have an opinion theyâ€™re intoxicated, thatâ€™s a lay opinion that may be\r\n  admissible in a courtroom; or if itâ€™s going to be helpful for the jury to\r\n  understand and does not require special skill, experience, or training.\r\n\tAn expert may give his\r\n  opinion if they qualify when thereâ€™s a scientifically, technical, or other\r\n  specialized knowledge required for the jury to understand the question.\r\n\tNow, in this particular\r\n  case this witness has not been qualified as an expert.Â  In order for an expert\r\n  to give an opinion, they have to be qualified.Â  And the court has to find that\r\n  theyâ€™re qualified.Â  This witness has not been qualified as an expert and Iâ€™m\r\n  going to tell you, you must disregard any suggestion either in the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  questions or any answer that this witness has given an opinion of any kind in\r\n  this case.Â  Sheâ€™s going to be treated as a lay witness, not an expert.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tSolicitor.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n  made no objection to the sufficiency of this instruction, but argues on appeal\r\n  that the trial judge erred in failing to grant a mistrial.Â  In my opinion, this\r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  As the factual recital above\r\n  demonstrates, appellant did not seek a mistrial when the solicitor first\r\n  questioned Dr. Crawford about her consulting role, and her assessments in\r\n  serious death-penalty type cases.Â  Instead, appellant merely objected.Â  The\r\n  trial judge sustained the objection and gave a curative instruction, to which\r\n  appellant did not object.Â  Since appellant accepted this ruling and neither\r\n  objected to the chargeâ€™s sufficiency nor moved for a mistrial following it, no\r\n  issue regarding these questions and answers are preserved for our review.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996).\r\nWhen\r\n  the solicitor resumed his improper questioning, the trial judge sustained the\r\n  objection.Â  One of appellantâ€™s attorneys sought a curative instruction; the\r\n  other, a mistrial.Â  Following the in camera arguments, the judge denied\r\n  the second attorneyâ€™s mistrial motion but then gave, again without objection,\r\n  the curative instruction apparently drafted by the otherÂ  lawyer.Â  Under these\r\n  circumstances, the mistrial issue is not before us.Â  State v. George, supra; cf. State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999) (mistrial motion arguably preserved where trial attorney specified he did\r\n  not â€œwaiveâ€ mistrial motion after hearing curative instruction).Â  Here,\r\n  appellant did not renew or reserve his mistrial motion after hearing the\r\n  curative instruction drafted by his own attorney, apparently finding it\r\n  sufficiently cured any prejudice from the solicitorâ€™s improper questioning.Â \r\n  Accordingly, there is no mistrial issue before the Court.\r\nAlthough\r\n  I do not believe the mistrial issue is preserved, because it is addressed, and\r\n  because I differ in my assessment, I comment briefly.Â  The Stateâ€™s position is\r\n  that Dr. Crawford was being offered merely as a â€œfactâ€ witness.Â  If this is so,\r\n  then her education, her training, her profession, and her special relationship\r\n  with the solicitorâ€™s office are irrelevant.Â  The only reason to allow this\r\n  background evidence is to enhance Dr. Crawfordâ€™s credentials, that is, to\r\n  permit the jury to view her testimony in light of her expertise.Â  Compare State v. Douglas, 380 S.C. 499, 671 S.E.2d 606 (2009) (testimony from\r\n  expert clothed â€œwith an air of authority that does not attach to â€œordinary\r\n  witnessesâ€â€) (Pleicones, J., dissenting).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  I do not understand why Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony, offered allegedly to show\r\n  appellantâ€™s mental state, was relevant in this penalty phase.Â  The State sought\r\n  to prove two aggravating circumstances, neither of which involved appellantâ€™s\r\n  state of mind.Â  Had appellant put his mental state at the time of the offense\r\n  in issue, then Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony as to her â€œlayâ€ observations in the\r\n  hours surrounding the offense would be relevant.Â  Here, however, Dr. Crawfordâ€™s\r\n  testimony was offered only to bolster the solicitorâ€™s decision that this case\r\n  warranted a death sentence.Â  Unlike the majority, I do not see how the curative\r\n  instruction negates the prejudice from Dr. Crawfordâ€™s irrelevant yet\r\n  prejudicial testimony.\r\n\r\n[1] This case consolidates Appellantâ€™s direct appeal and the mandatory review\r\n  provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (2003).Â  \r\n[2] Dr. Crawfordâ€™s employment by the Department of Mental Health required her to do\r\n  a variety of things, including going on SWAT calls and providing assistance to\r\n  prosecutors.Â  \r\n[3] Dr. Crawford interviewed Appellant the evening of the crime and the next morning.Â \r\n  Dr. Crawford and the investigating officers testified that Appellant was\r\n  apprised of his rights prior to these interviews pursuant to Miranda v.\r\n    Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).Â  \r\n[4] Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896) (establishing the charge used\r\n  to encourage a deadlocked jury to reach a verdict). \r\n[5] At a post-trial hearing, the trial judge denied all of defense counselâ€™s\r\n  motions.\r\n[6] In Hughes, this Court determined an Allen charge was an\r\n  â€œeven-handed admonition to both the minority and majority jurorsâ€ where it\r\n  stated: â€œEach juror who finds himself or herself to be in the minority should\r\n  reconsider their views in light of the opinions of the jurors of the majority\r\n  and, conversely each juror finding themselves in the majority should give equal\r\n  consideration to the views of the minority.â€Â  Hughes, 336 S.C. at\r\n  597-98, 521 S.E.2d at 507.Â  \r\n[7] Although we find no reversible error in the Allen charge in this case,\r\n  we take this opportunity to caution trial judges against using the following\r\n  language: â€œwith the hope that you can arrive at a verdict.â€Â  Because jurors are\r\n  not required to reach a verdict after expressing that they are deadlocked, we\r\n  believe this language could potentially be construed as being coercive.Â \r\n  Furthermore, to alleviate problems in future cases where the jury is\r\n  deadlocked, we would advise trial judges to instruct the jurors not to disclose\r\n  their numerical division.Â  \r\n[8] The question of whether the trial judge committed\r\n  an abuse of discretion in denying Appellantâ€™s mistrial motion is preserved for\r\n  our review.Â  Appellant objected to Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony before it was given\r\n  and renewed this objection both during and after her testimony.Â  Appellant\r\n  moved for mistrial on these grounds, and the trial judge denied the motion.Â \r\n  Appellant then sought to introduce a curative instruction, which the trial\r\n  judge accepted.Â  Under these circumstances, the trial judgeâ€™s denial of the\r\n  mistrial motion is properly preserved for appellate review.Â  See State v. Rogers, 361 S.C. 178, 183, 603 S.E.2d 910, 912-13 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œâ€˜There are four\r\n  basic requirements to preserving issues at trial for appellate review. Â The\r\n  issue must have been (1) raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, (2)\r\n  raised by the appellant, (3) raised in a timely manner, and (4) raised to the\r\n  trial court with sufficient specificity.â€™â€) (quoting Jean Hoefer Toal et al., Appellate\r\n  Practice in South Carolina 57 (2d ed. 2002)). \r\n[9] In my view, the better practice is to permit only one of the attorneys to\r\n  object to evidence.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Brian D.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Daniel E.\r\n          Grigg, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Appellate\r\n          Defender Robert M. Pachak, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  This Court granted the State's\r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari to review the post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\n  judge's order granting J. Lamar Kolle a new trial following his plea of guilty\r\n  to trafficking in cocaine in an amount greater than 28 grams but less than 100\r\n  grams.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 12, 2003, Officer Vincent Canfora received a\r\n  phone call at approximately 11:30 p.m. concerning a complaint about loud music\r\n  at the Myrtle Beach apartment where Kolle was staying.Â  When he arrived between\r\n  11:45 p.m. to 12:00 a.m., Officer Canfora heard music coming from inside the\r\n  apartment.Â  As he knocked on the door, he observed &quot;fresh damage&quot; to\r\n  the door, which appeared to be forced entry marks.Â  Although the door seemed to\r\n  be open, Officer Canfora knocked on it for approximately five to ten minutes\r\n  while announcing he was a police officer.Â  Receiving no response, he then\r\n  knocked on the window beside the door.Â  Because there were lights on in the\r\n  apartment and no one answered his knocks, Officer Canfora &quot;presumed that\r\n  there may be something wrong inside the apartment . . . that somebody was in\r\n  the residence, maybe injured or incapacitated.&quot;Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on his assessment of the situation, Officer Canfora called for a back-up\r\n  officer to assist him with making an entry into the apartment.Â  Lance Corporal\r\n  Steven Atwood responded to the scene within three minutes of receiving Officer\r\n  Canfora's call.Â  The two officers then decided to enter the apartment by\r\n  pushing on the door.Â Â  Upon entering, the officers announced themselves as\r\n  police officers and asked if anyone inside the residence needed assistance.Â  Once\r\n  inside, the officers conducted a protective search of the residence.Â  During\r\n  this protective search, Officer Canfora observed a small plate with a moderate\r\n  amount of what appeared to be cocaine, partially covered by a saltine cracker,\r\n  drying under an elevated oscillating fan.Â  The officers also noticed a large\r\n  steel press used for processing and manufacturing cocaine as well as other\r\n  materials commonly used for processing or cutting cocaine.Â  Finding no one in\r\n  the apartment, the officers seized the small amount of cocaine-like substance\r\n  and returned to the police department.Â  After the substance field-tested\r\n  positive for cocaine, Officer Canfora completed an application for a search\r\n  warrant for the apartment based on the cocaine seized during the initial entry.Â \r\n  According to Officer Canfora, he and another narcotics officer prepared the\r\n  warrant at approximately 12:30 a.m.\r\nAfter\r\n  obtaining the search warrant from a municipal judge, Officer Canfora returned\r\n  to the residence at approximately 12:43 a.m. with his lieutenant and another\r\n  narcotics officer in order to execute the warrant. Â As the officers knocked on\r\n  the door, Sharon Hakes opened the door.Â  Once inside, the officers presented\r\n  Hakes, Jessica Everhart, and Kolle with a copy of the search warrant.Â  During the\r\n  subsequent search, Officer Canfora discovered a bag of flour in a kitchen\r\n  cabinet that contained approximately sixty-three grams of cocaine.Â  \r\nAs a\r\n  result, the officers arrested Kolle, Hakes, and Everhart.[1]Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, the officers also arrested Willis Holmes, the resident\r\n  named on the apartment lease.Â  \r\nSubsequently, the Horry County grand jury indicted\r\n  Kolle for trafficking in cocaine in an amount of more than 28 grams but less\r\n  than 100 grams.Â  In response to the charge, Kolle's public defender filed a\r\n  discovery motion with the solicitor's office.Â  Ultimately, this requested information\r\n  was turned over by the solicitor's office to plea counsel, a private attorney\r\n  retained by Kolle.Â  In addition to the public defender's discovery motion, plea\r\n  counsel filed a motion in which he requested &quot;any and all search warrants\r\n  applied for and a copy of all dispatch logs from the North Myrtle Beach Police\r\n  Department.&quot;\r\n Based on his review\r\n  of the discovery information, plea counsel moved to suppress evidence seized\r\n  pursuant to the search warrant.Â Â Â  After a hearing, the trial judge denied this\r\n  motion on the ground there were exigent circumstances to justify the officers'\r\n  entry into the apartment.Â  Additionally, the judge ruled the officers saw the\r\n  cocaine in plain view.Â  As a result, the judge concluded the search was valid.Â  \r\nOn the day of this\r\n  ruling, Kolle pled guilty to trafficking cocaine in an amount greater than 28\r\n  grams but less than 100 grams. Â The plea judge sentenced Kolle to seven years\r\n  in prison.Â  \r\nKolle did not\r\n  appeal his plea or sentence.Â  Four months after the plea proceeding, Kolle\r\n  filed a PCR application.Â  In this application, Kolle alleged he was being held\r\n  in custody unlawfully based on the following grounds:Â  the trafficking charge\r\n  arose out of an unlawful search and seizure; the plea judge lacked subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction due to an invalid indictment; and he did not receive all of\r\n  the discovery materials that he was entitled to pursuant to Brady v.\r\n    Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).Â  \r\nUnderlying\r\n  these allegations, Kolle primarily contended plea counsel was ineffective in\r\n  failing to:Â  procure certain discovery materials; thoroughly advocate the\r\n  suppression of the drug evidence; properly advise him regarding plea\r\n  negotiations and potential sentences; and properly inform him of his right to\r\n  appeal. \r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge held a hearing on Kolle's application.Â  At this hearing, plea counsel\r\n  testified regarding the chronology of his representation of Kolle.Â  When he\r\n  agreed to represent Kolle, plea counsel had been practicing law for\r\n  approximately three years and had not yet represented a client with a felony\r\n  charge.\r\nAt\r\n  the onset of his representation, plea counsel received discovery materials from\r\n  the solicitor's office that had been previously requested by Kolle's public\r\n  defender.Â  Although plea counsel had limited discovery material, he believed\r\n  the search that led to Kolle's charge was improper, particularly the lack of\r\n  exigent circumstances.Â  In turn, plea counsel filed a motion to suppress the drug\r\n  evidence. \r\nIn\r\n  recounting the suppression hearing, plea counsel conceded that he did not point\r\n  out the discrepancies between the officers' testimony and the documentary\r\n  evidence, which included the incident reports, the search warrant, and the\r\n  police call logs.Â  Specifically, PCR counsel established that plea counsel\r\n  failed to question the officers regarding the following time discrepancies:Â  the\r\n  call/dispatch log indicated the loud music complaint was received at 12:43\r\n  a.m.; Officer Canfora arrived at the apartment at 12:48 a.m.; the search warrant\r\n  appears to indicate it was issued at 12:01 a.m. and executed at 12:43 a.m.Â  Plea\r\n  counsel admitted that he did not have this documentary evidence in his file. Â He\r\n  further acknowledged that he never requested the lab report or the chain of\r\n  custody report regarding the cocaine that was seized pursuant to the search\r\n  warrant.[2]Â  \r\nIn\r\n  terms of plea negotiations, plea counsel testified that prior to the\r\n  suppression hearing the State offered Kolle a sentence of ten years suspended\r\n  upon the service of five years with three years' probation.[3]Â Â Â \r\n  Plea counsel admitted that he told Kolle the offer was not &quot;a good deal,&quot;\r\n  but that it would remain open even after the suppression hearing.Â  He\r\n  acknowledged that the offer did not remain open and was significantly less than\r\n  the seven-year sentence Kolle received. \r\nAt\r\n  the beginning of his testimony, Kolle reiterated his allegations of ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel.Â  In explaining his dissatisfaction with plea counsel's\r\n  representation, Kolle outlined his version of the facts and primarily argued\r\n  that the search warrant and subsequent seizure of the cocaine was improper\r\n  given there were no exigent circumstances for the initial entry. Â Kolle\r\n  contended that the evidence could have been suppressed had plea counsel:Â \r\n  thoroughly investigated the case; filed a more inclusive discovery motion;\r\n  interviewed the other co-defendants; pointed out during the suppression hearing\r\n  the discrepancies between the call logs, the incident reports, and the search\r\n  warrant; and identified errors in the chain of custody evidence form that was\r\n  prepared for the cocaine. \r\nIn\r\n  terms of his decision to plead guilty, Kolle claimed he felt under duress to\r\n  accept the plea because plea counsel was not prepared for trial. Additionally,\r\n  Kolle asserted plea counsel provided incorrect information regarding the State's\r\n  initial plea offer.Â  Specifically, Kolle contended plea counsel told him the\r\n  offer was not a good deal and he should not accept it until after the suppression\r\n  hearing.Â  Because he did not have accurate advice or information prior to the\r\n  plea, Kolle claimed his decision to plead guilty was not knowing and\r\n  voluntary.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Kolle acknowledged that he had admitted his guilt regarding\r\n  the trafficking in cocaine charge at the plea proceeding as well as during his\r\n  testimony at co-defendant Holmes's trial.Â  Kolle, however, explained that he\r\n  pled guilty and expressed satisfaction with plea counsel's representation\r\n  because he lacked the necessary information to raise any challenge during the\r\n  plea proceeding.Â  \r\nFollowing the\r\n  hearing, the PCR judge granted Kolle's application and ordered a new trial.Â  In\r\n  reaching this conclusion, the PCR judge found that plea counsel's failure to\r\n  point out the discrepancies between the officers' testimony and the documentary\r\n  evidence constituted ineffective assistance.Â  Specifically, the PCR judge\r\n  believed that had plea counsel raised these issues at the suppression hearing,\r\n  this information &quot;would have resulted at the very minimum suppressing the\r\n  evidence gained in the search warrant to sustain the evidence on the\r\n  Trafficking charge.&quot;Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the PCR judge found plea counsel was deficient in failing to properly advise\r\n  Kolle regarding the State's plea offer.Â  Because plea counsel misadvised Kolle\r\n  not to plead guilty prior to the suppression hearing, which in turn resulted in\r\n  the withdrawal of the State's negotiated sentence, the PCR judge found that\r\n  these facts &quot;undermined the willful and voluntary nature of [Kolleâ€™s]\r\n  plea.&quot;Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  the PCR judge found plea counsel would have discovered exculpatory evidence regarding\r\n  the search warrant and radio/dispatch logs had he properly prepared for trial.Â \r\n  The PCR judge believed &quot;such discovery would have reversed the outcome.&quot;Â \r\n  Thus, the judge held that plea counsel's lack of preparation satisfied the\r\n  standard of deficiency under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668\r\n  (1984).Â  Ultimately, the judge concluded that this deficient performance &quot;deprived\r\n  [Kolle] of adequate representation and that a different verdict from a verdict\r\n  of guilty could have been a logical conclusion.&quot;Â  \r\nThe State filed a\r\n  motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure.Â  In a summary order, the PCR judge denied the State's\r\n  motion.Â  \r\nThis Court granted\r\n  the State's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judge's order. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State contends the PCR judge erred in finding that\r\n  Kolle did not freely, knowingly, and voluntarily enter his guilty plea.Â  In\r\n  support of this contention, the State asserts that plea counsel was not\r\n  deficient in his representation of Kolle given he:Â  met with Kolle on multiple\r\n  occasions prior to the entry of the plea; investigated the case; requested discovery;\r\n  and thoroughly challenged the search which precipitated Kolle's arrest for the\r\n  drug charge.Â  \r\nEven if counsel's\r\n  performance was deficient, the State claims Kolle failed to establish that he\r\n  was prejudiced.Â  The State asserts that Kolle lacked standing to challenge the\r\n  legality of the search and seizure, thus, negating Kolle's primary basis for\r\n  contesting the drug charge.Â  Additionally, the State argues that Kolleâ€™s guilty\r\n  plea &quot;must stand due to the overwhelming evidence of his guilt.&quot;Â  \r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  &quot;There is a strong presumption that counsel\r\n  rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in\r\n  making all significant decisions in the case.&quot;Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372\r\n  S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007).Â Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she\r\n  is entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  &quot;A defendant who enters a plea on the advice of counsel\r\n  may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the plea by showing\r\n  that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of\r\n  reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\r\n  errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty, but would have insisted on\r\n  going to trial.&quot;Â  Rolen v. State, 384 S.C. 409, 413, 683 S.E.2d\r\n  471, 474 (2009). Â &quot;A\r\n  reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\r\n  the outcome of trial.&quot; Â Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480\r\n  S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â  &quot;Plea counsel is ineffective within the meaning\r\n  of the Sixth Amendment only when the applicant satisfies both requirements.&quot;Â  Stalk v. State, 383 S.C. 559, 561, 681 S.E.2d 592, 593 (2009).Â  Â \r\n&quot;In determining guilty plea issues, it\r\n  is proper to consider the guilty plea transcript as well as evidence at the PCR hearing.&quot; Â Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554,\r\n  558, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).Â  &quot;Specifically, the voluntariness of a\r\n  guilty plea is not determined by an examination of a specific inquiry made by\r\n  the sentencing judge alone, but is determined from both the record made at the\r\n  time of the entry of the guilty plea, and also from the\r\n  record of the PCR hearing.&quot; Â Roddy\r\n    v. State, 339 S.C. 29, 33, 528 S.E.2d 418, 420 (2000).Â  &quot;The\r\n  longstanding test for determining the validity of a guilty plea is 'whether the\r\n  plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative\r\n  courses of action open to the defendant.'&quot;Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56 (1985) (quoting North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31 (1970)).\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the PCR court's decision, an appellate court is concerned only with whether\r\n  any evidence of probative value exists to support that decision.&nbsp; Smith\r\n    v. State, 369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006).Â  We will uphold\r\n  the findings of the PCR court when there is any evidence of probative value to\r\n  support them, and will reverse the decision of the PCR court when it is\r\n  controlled by an error&nbsp;of law.&nbsp; Suber, 371 S.C. at 558-59, 640\r\n  S.E.2d at 886.Â  &quot;This Court gives great\r\n  deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) court's findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law.&quot;Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 368, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  \r\nI.\r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, we find the State's argument regarding Kolle's lack of\r\n  standing was not preserved for this Court's consideration.Â  Based on our review\r\n  of the record, the State did not raise this claim at the PCR hearing but did so\r\n  only in its motion for reconsideration.Â  Therefore, this argument is not\r\n  properly before the Court.Â  See Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506,\r\n  514 n.7, 511 S.E.2d 62, 66 n.7 (1999) (concluding issue that was neither raised\r\n  to nor ruled upon by the PCR court was not preserved for appellate review); see\r\n    also Johnson v. Sonoco Prods. Co., 381 S.C. 172, 177, 672 S.E.2d 567,\r\n  570 (2009) (recognizing that an issue may not be raised for the first time in a\r\n  motion to reconsider).Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if properly preserved, we disagree with the State's assertion that Kolle lacked\r\n  standing to challenge the search and seizure which precipitated his arrest for\r\n  the drug charge.Â  The fact that Kolle did not own or lease the apartment that\r\n  was searched does not negate his standing to challenge the search and\r\n  subsequent seizure.Â  Following the decisions of the United States Supreme\r\n  Court, this Court has definitively held that an overnight guest has a\r\n  reasonable expectation of privacy, the legal prerequisite to confer standing on\r\n  an individual.Â  See State v. Missouri, 361 S.C. 107, 603 S.E.2d\r\n  594 (2004) (citing Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91 (1990) and concluding\r\n  that defendant, who on several occasions in the past and the occasion in\r\n  question stayed at the searched apartment, had a reasonable expectation of\r\n  privacy to challenge the search and seizure which resulted in his charge of\r\n  trafficking in crack cocaine).Â  Here, there was evidence that Holmes, the\r\n  person who leased the apartment, befriended Kolle and permitted him to stay for\r\n  an extended period of time at the residence.Â Â Â  Accordingly, Kolle had a\r\n  reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment and, thus, had standing to\r\n  challenge the search.\r\nII.\r\nFinding\r\n  that Kolle had standing, we address the remainder of the State's arguments.Â  \r\nA\r\n  determination of the core issue of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a\r\n  two-part assessment.Â  We find it is necessary to determine whether plea counsel\r\n  was ineffective:Â  (1) with respect to Kolle's fundamental decision to plead\r\n  guilty; and (2) regarding Kolle's decision to reject the State's initial plea\r\n  offer and enter a plea without a negotiated sentence.\r\nA.\r\nCognizant of this\r\n  Court's recent pronouncements regarding guilty plea challenges and its standard\r\n  of review, there is evidence to support the PCR judge's determination that plea\r\n  counsel was ineffective in advising Kolle to plead guilty.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we agree with the PCR judge's decision that plea counsel was deficient in\r\n  failing to procure pertinent discovery materials, in particular the\r\n  call/dispatch logs and the search warrant.Â  If plea counsel had these\r\n  materials, he could have effectively cross-examined the officers at the\r\n  suppression hearing and pointed out the time discrepancies and the following\r\n  additional discrepancies:Â  (1) the arrest warrant affidavit, the incident\r\n  reports, and the search warrant refer to the drug evidence as crack cocaine as\r\n  opposed to powder cocaine; and (2) the investigative report and the affidavit\r\n  in support of the search warrant do not reference the &quot;fresh damage&quot; or\r\n  &quot;forced entry&quot; to the apartment door as testified to by Officer\r\n  Canfora to justify the exigent circumstances for entry into the apartment. Â Had\r\n  plea counsel adequately attacked the credibility of the officers, there is a\r\n  reasonable probability this would have influenced the trial judge's decision\r\n  regarding the existence of exigent circumstances, i.e., affected the\r\n  outcome of the suppression motion.Â Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  if plea counsel truly believed the suppression issue was meritorious, he could\r\n  have advised Kolle to proceed to trial and, if convicted, challenge the denial\r\n  of the suppression motion on direct appeal.\r\nB.\r\nGiven there is\r\n  evidence to support the PCR judge's finding that plea counsel was ineffective\r\n  with respect to his representation regarding the suppression hearing and, in\r\n  turn, Kolle's decision to plead guilty, we need not address the remaining\r\n  issue.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  in the interest of thoroughness, we review the remaining issue of whether plea\r\n  counsel was ineffective in advising Kolle to reject the State's initial plea\r\n  offer and plead guilty without a negotiated sentence.\r\nWe find plea\r\n  counsel was deficient in advising Kolle that the State's initial plea offer was\r\n  not a &quot;good deal&quot; and misinforming Kolle that the offer would remain\r\n  open until after the suppression hearing.Â  \r\nClearly,\r\n  the State's offer of a sentence of ten years suspended on the service of five\r\n  years with three years' probation was significantly better than the seven to\r\n  twenty-five-year sentence Kolle faced for the trafficking charge.[4]Â \r\n  Moreover, plea counsel advised him not to plead guilty until after the\r\n  suppression hearing at which time the State withdrew the plea offer. Â Had Kolle\r\n  known that the State would withdraw this offer after the suppression hearing,\r\n  he may have decided to accept it and received a lower sentence.Â  Cf.Â  Davie\r\n    v. State, 381 S.C. 601, 675 S.E.2d 416 (2009) (concluding petitioner proved\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel where plea counsel failed to communicate the\r\n  State's proposed plea offer which was a significantly lower sentence than\r\n  petitioner would have accepted had it been communicated).[5]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find there is evidence to\r\n  support the decision of the PCR judge.Â  Accordingly, the order granting Kolle's\r\n  PCR application is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, J.,\r\n  concurs. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion. KITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that we must affirm the\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) judge's order granting respondent PCR.Â  Our scope\r\n  of review is limited to whether there is any evidence of probative value in the\r\n  record to support the PCR judge's findings,Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C.\r\n  115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989), and we give great deference to the PCR judge's\r\n  credibility determinations.Â  Drayton v. Evatt, 312 S.C. 4, 430 S.E.2d\r\n  517 (1993).Â  This deference requires that we accept the PCR judge's finding\r\n  that a witness is credible even where the PCR testimony is directly refuted by\r\n  the trial or guilty plea record.Â  See Solomon v. State, 313 S.C.\r\n  526, 443 S.E.2d 540 (1994).Â  Given our limited scope of review, and the\r\n  deference accorded the PCR judge's credibility determinations, I concur in the\r\n  result reached by the majority here.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â \r\n  I vote to reverse and reinstate the guilty plea and sentence.\r\nThe\r\n  plea judge, the Honorable Steven H. John, conducted a thorough and textbook\r\n  guilty plea.Â  J. Lamar Kolle pled guilty freely and voluntarily, and\r\n  acknowledged satisfaction with plea counsel.Â  \r\n\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â Â  Now, you are here with your attorney . . . is that correct?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  Have you told him everything you need to tell him about this case?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  I believe so, sir.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  All right, sir.Â  Have you had enough time to talk to him?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  Do you need any more time to talk to him?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  No, sir.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  Has he done everything that you expected of him, that you wanted him to\r\n    do to try to help you in this case?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  Are you satisfied with his representation?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  Any complaints about his representations?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  guilty plea colloquy, including allocution, revealed the following facts.Â  In\r\n  the summer of 2003, Kolle and â€œladiesâ€ traveled from Ohio to North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  Kolle and his lady friends were befriended by Willis Holmes, who invited the group â€œto stay at his house and save on the hotel bill.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  cocaine was found in Holmesâ€™s residence.Â  According to the plea allocution: \r\n\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  I let Mr. Willis Holmes know what me and the ladies had in our possession,\r\n    and he said that wouldnâ€™t be an issue, but he would prefer that it stayed\r\n    outside of the house.\r\n  It\r\n    stayed outside of the house, in my vehicle, for the first three or four days,\r\n    and then once Mr. Holmes started selling it and purchasing it, it came in the\r\n    house, and he knew that because he had asked for some in the house, and\r\n    received it in the house from me, and it stayed in the house from that time\r\n    on.Â  I demonstrated the machine to Mr. Holmes also, so he was well aware of\r\n    what was going on.\r\n  THE COURT:Â \r\n    All right, sir.Â  \r\n  Solicitor,\r\n    anything further that you would like to ask Mr. Kolle at this time?\r\n  SOLICITOR:Â \r\n    Your Honor, I would ask that - in his allocution he indicated the â€œstuff.â€Â \r\n    What would that â€œstuffâ€ be?\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  Mr. Kolle.\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  The cocaine ---\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  All right.\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  ---And the tools.Â  \r\n  THE COURT:Â  And\r\n    the paraphernalia that was seized by the police; is that correct?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  Yes sir.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  All right, sir.Â  And the weight that - of the cocaine that was seized,\r\n    in your estimation, that was a correct amount as far as the weight at the time\r\n    that it was seized, as best you could tell?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  I believe it is a little heavy, and if you review the documents there\r\n    are several different amounts that the police have come up with, and thatâ€™s\r\n    going to be due to moisture and sweating, so I would ---\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  All right.Â  But itâ€™s no question in your mind it was certainly a good\r\n    deal bit more than twenty-eight grams?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  Yes.\r\n  THE COURT:Â \r\n    All right.Â  Now, Mr. Kolle, just a second.Â  I just have one or two other\r\n    questions for you.Â  Regarding the answers that you have given me here today,\r\n    are they the truth?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  Yes.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  And did anybody tell you, or give you the answers that you have given\r\n    to the Court, or are they your answers?\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  They are my answers.\r\n\r\nFollowing the trial\r\n  of Holmes, Kolle appeared for sentencing before Judge John.Â  Kolle recited the\r\n  reasons he believed he was a good candidate for probation:\r\n\r\n  DEFENDANT\r\n    KOLLE:Â  I just wanted to let the Court know that I was offered some pleas that\r\n    were a lesser sentence than this, and it was not the fact that I was not trying\r\n    to accept responsibility for the crime, but as informed by my attorney, he felt\r\n    that it was an illegal search and seizure, so thatâ€™s why I took it to this\r\n    point, and I feel like I kind of lost out a little bit because of that, and I\r\n    just want to say that I do accept responsibility for what happened, but in the\r\n    same light, these girls, they were of equal responsibility.Â  They have known\r\n    whatâ€™s gone on, and I think that is apparent by their own statement.Â  They\r\n    received a hundred day plea and some probation.Â  Iâ€™m not - I feel that I should\r\n    pay for my crime, but however, I have seven kids which, you know what Iâ€™m\r\n    saying, are in dire need of my support, and I just request that the Court have\r\n    mercy on me and grant me probation.Â  I successfully have completed parole in Ohio when I - on my prior offense, with no problems, and I would not be a threat to\r\n    society, and I feel that Iâ€™m a good candidate for probation.\r\n  THE\r\n    COURT:Â  Iâ€™m going to look at one thing first, before I impose a sentence in\r\n    this matter.Â  . . .Â  [N]o probation is possible regarding this particular\r\n    matter.Â  The court does feel that the minimum sentence should be imposed in\r\n    this offense that is allowable by law, and that would be the sentence of seven\r\n    years.Â  That is the sentence in this particular matter.\r\n\r\nAccording\r\n  to Kolleâ€™s PCR testimony, when he pled guilty he was aware of plea counselâ€™s\r\n  alleged deficient representation and repeatedly complained to counsel about\r\n  it.Â  For example, Kolle testified that he and counsel â€œactually debated about\r\n  this beforehandâ€; Kolle â€œcontinued to argue with [counsel] and he continued to\r\n  try not to do itâ€ when counsel apparently failed to investigate the case as\r\n  instructed by Kolle; and Kolle testified that â€œ[counsel] didnâ€™t investigate my\r\n  case whatsoever or follow my instructions concerning the investigation of my\r\n  case.â€[6]\r\nKolleâ€™s\r\n  PCR testimony stands in stark contrast to his guilty plea testimony.Â \r\n  Presumably, Kolle lied to the plea judge in stating he was satisfied with\r\n  counsel and had no complaints.Â  It is my\r\n  view that a guilty plea is not rendered involuntary where, as here, a defendant\r\n  knowingly testifies falsely at the guilty plea proceeding.[7]Â  I would not\r\n  grant a PCR applicant relief under such circumstances.Â  I find no evidence to\r\n  support the PCR court's decision and would reverse the grant of PCR.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Hakes and Everhart gave statements in which they\r\n  identified Kolle as the primary participant in the drug activity.Â  \r\n[2]Â Through another witness, PCR counsel attempted to\r\n  establish that there was a ten-day &quot;break&quot; in the chain of custody\r\n  for the cocaine.Â  \r\n[3]Â Kolle's PCR counsel played a tape of a conversation\r\n  between Kolle and plea counsel that substantiated this plea offer.Â  \r\n[4]Â Â In making this offer, the State would have reduced\r\n  Kolle's indicted charge to trafficking in cocaine in an amount greater than ten\r\n  grams but less than twenty-eight grams, which would not constitute a violent\r\n  offense.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) (2002) (providing for sentence\r\n  of a term of imprisonment of not less than three years nor more than ten years\r\n  for a first offense).\r\n[5] The dissent appears to contend that a defendant may\r\n  never raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel following the entry of\r\n  a guilty plea if he expressed satisfaction with his attorney during the plea\r\n  colloquy.Â  An expression of satisfaction with plea counsel is necessarily\r\n  conditional.Â  The extent of satisfaction is dependent upon the attorney's\r\n  diligence and degree of information shared with the client.Â  Although a plea of\r\n  guilty may preclude certain PCR claims, it would not preclude those that directly\r\n  involve the voluntariness and knowledge with which the guilty plea was made.Â \r\n  Here, Kolle entered his guilty plea without the benefit of all exculpatory\r\n  information or knowledge that the State's initial plea offer would not remain\r\n  open.Â  Because Kolle was unaware of this information, his claim of ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel clearly impinged upon the voluntariness and knowledge\r\n  with which he entered his plea.Â  Accordingly, we find this case constitutes a\r\n  valid collateral attack of a guilty plea.Â  See Davila v. United\r\n    States, 258 F.3d 448, 451 (6th Cir. 2001) (considering question of whether\r\n  a plea agreement that waives the right to file for post-conviction relief is\r\n  enforceable when the petition claims ineffective assistance of counsel and\r\n  holding that &quot;[w]hen a defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily\r\n  waives the right to collaterally attack his or her sentence, he or she is\r\n  precluded from bring[ing] a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel&quot;); Watts\r\n    v. State, 248 S.W.3d 725, 729 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;Where . . . Â there\r\n  is a negotiated plea of guilty, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is\r\n  immaterial except to the extent that it impinges upon the voluntariness and\r\n  knowledge with which the guilty plea was made.&quot; (citation omitted)); cf. Spoone v. State, 379 S.C. 138, 665 S.E.2d 605 (2008) (concluding\r\n  appellate rights and post-conviction review may be waived by a knowingly and\r\n  voluntarily entered guilty plea pursuant to a written plea agreement).\r\n[6] Moreover, Kolle fancies himself as a legal expert, as\r\n  reflected in his lecture-like testimony to the PCR court on the laws of search\r\n  and seizure and Brady.Â  \r\n[7] The majority opinion states that I â€œappear[]\r\n  to contend that a defendant may never raise a claim of ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel following the entry of a guilty plea if he expressed satisfaction with\r\n  his attorney during the plea colloquy.â€Â  I contend no such thing.Â  I contend\r\n  that a defendant should not be permitted to successfully collaterally challenge\r\n  a guilty plea on the basis of an involuntary plea tied to a claim of deficient\r\n  representation where: (1) the alleged deficient representation was known to the\r\n  defendant at the time of the guilty plea; and (2) the defendant knowingly\r\n  testified falsely at the plea proceeding concerning plea counselâ€™s\r\n  representation.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26772","title":"State v.

Â Smith was sentenced to twelve years in prison.Â  Smith's\r\n  direct appeal challenged only the denial of his directed verdict motion.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion.[1]Â \r\n  Smith then sought post-conviction relief (PCR).\r\nII.\r\nIn his application for\r\n  PCR, Smith claimed trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing\r\n  to object to &quot;hearsay testimony that was improperly corroborative of the Victim.&quot;Â \r\n  At the PCR hearing, Smith contended he was entitled to a new trial because\r\n  forensic interviewer Ginger Gist had testified without objection that the\r\n  Victim told Gist that Smith had sexually assaulted her.Â  The forensic\r\n  interviewer, at the invitation of the solicitor, also testified without\r\n  objection that she found the Victim's statement &quot;believable&quot; and stated\r\n  the Victim had no reason &quot;not to be truthful.&quot;Â  \r\nSmith\r\n  contends the testimony of the forensic interviewer interjected impermissible\r\n  hearsay into the trial, which improperly bolstered the Victim's testimony.Â  Smith\r\n  additionally contends counsel's failure to object to this testimony resulted in\r\n  prejudice, pointing to the State's closing argument, which emphasized the\r\n  forensic interviewerâ€™s testimony.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  denying relief, the PCR court found trial counsel's failure to object was a\r\n  valid &quot;trial strategy.&quot; Â See Watson v. State, 370 S.C.\r\n  68, 634 S.E.2d 642 (2006) (recognizing when counsel provides a valid trial\r\n  strategy in response to a Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n  claim, counsel's performance will not be deemed deficient).Â  However, when trial\r\n  counsel was asked if he had a strategy in failing to object to the hearsay and the\r\n  bolstering testimony, he responded, &quot;none.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR court further found Smith had failed to show he was prejudiced by the\r\n  challenged testimony.Â  The PCR court's order acknowledged that the testimony at\r\n  trial was conflicting, but noted the Victim had identified Smith as the\r\n  perpetrator and a partial DNA profile had indicated the probability of Smith not\r\n  being the assailant was &quot;1 in 1600.&quot;Â  As noted, the PCR court denied Smith's\r\n  application for relief. \r\nIII.\r\nThe\r\n  burden is on the petitioner to prove the allegations in the PCR application.Â  Bannister\r\n    v. State, 333 S.C. 298, 302, 509 S.E.2d 807, 809 (1998).Â  In reviewing the PCR judge's decision, an appellate\r\n  court will uphold the PCR court if any evidence of probative value supports the\r\n  decision.Â  Smith v. State, 369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006) (citing Cherry v. State,\r\n  300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989)). \r\nTo\r\n  establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the\r\n  PCR applicant must prove: (1) counsel's performance fell below an objective\r\n  standard of reasonableness, and (2) counsel's deficient performance prejudiced\r\n  the defendant's case. Â Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Cherry, 300 S.C. at 117, 386 S.E.2d at 625.Â  &quot;An error by counsel,\r\n  even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the\r\n  judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.&quot;Â \r\n    Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691.Â  To establish prejudice, the defendant is\r\n  required &quot;to show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\r\n  counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\r\n  different. Â A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.&quot; Â Id. at 694.\r\n  Â Moreover, no prejudice occurs, despite trial counsel's deficient performance,\r\n  where there is otherwise overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.Â  Rosemond\r\n    v. Catoe, 383 S.C. 320, 325, 680 S.E.2d 5, 8 (2009). \r\nIV.\r\nA.\r\nLimited,\r\n  Non-hearsay Corroborative Testimony in a CSC Case\r\nIn a\r\n  CSC case, the testimony of a witness regarding the Victim's out-of-court\r\n  statement is not hearsay when:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    declarant testifies at the trial . . . and is subject to cross-examination\r\n    concerning the statement, and the statement is . . . consistent with the\r\n    declarant's testimony in a criminal sexual conduct case or attempted criminal\r\n    sexual conduct case where the declarant is the alleged Victim and the statement\r\n    is limited to the time and place of the incident.Â  \r\n\r\nRule\r\n  801(d)(1), SCRE (emphasis added).\r\nIn Jolly v. State, this Court found trial counsel ineffective for\r\n  failing to object to the introduction of a social worker's testimony that the\r\n  child Victim had discussed her sexual abuse by Jolly.Â  314 S.C. 17, 20, 443\r\n  S.E.2d 566, 568 (1994). Â This Court reversed the PCR\r\n  court's denial of relief after finding there was a &quot;reasonable\r\n  probability&quot; that the social worker's testimony affected the outcome of\r\n  Jolly's trial.Â  Id. at 21, 443 S.E.2d at 569.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 801(d)(1), SCRE, corroborative witness testimony is limited to time and\r\n  place of the alleged assault.Â  The corroborative testimony cannot include\r\n  &quot;details or particulars&quot; regarding the assault.Â  Dawkins v. State,\r\n  346 S.C. 151, 156, 551 S.E.2d 260, 262 (2001). Â In Dawkins, four\r\n  witnesses testified without objection regarding the Victim's out-of-court\r\n  conversations with them concerning the alleged abuse, and each witness repeated\r\n  the Victim's identification of Dawkins as the perpetrator.Â  Id. at 154,\r\n  551 S.E.2d at 261.Â  This Court found trial counsel's failure to object to the\r\n  admission of inadmissible corroborative hearsay was an error that fell below an\r\n  objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Id. at 156, 551 S.E.2d at 263.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the Court disagreed with the PCR court's finding that no prejudice\r\n  had resulted from the improper corroboration testimony, explaining:\r\n\r\n  [P]etitioner\r\n    was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance because improper\r\n    corroboration testimony that is merely cumulative to the [V]ictim's testimony\r\n    cannot be harmless.Â  . . .Â  '[I]t is precisely this cumulative effect which\r\n    enhances the devastating impact of improper corroboration.'Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 156-57, 551 S.E.2d at 263 (quoting Jolly, 314 S.C. at 21, 443 S.E.2d at 569).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast to Dawkins, in another PCR case involving CSC, the Court\r\n  applied the Strickland analysis and denied relief after finding: (1)\r\n  defense counsel's failure to object to the admission of written witness\r\n  statements that went beyond time and place of the alleged sexual assault fell\r\n  below an objective standard of reasonableness, but (2) counsel's failure\r\n  to object had not prejudiced the defendant's case &quot;[i]n light of the\r\n  overwhelming evidence presented by the State.&quot;Â  Huggler v. State, 360 S.C. 627, 634-36, 602 S.E.2d 753, 757-58 (2004).\r\nB.\r\nTrial Strategy\r\nCounsel's performance is accorded a favorable presumption, and\r\n  a reviewing court proceeds from the rebuttable presumption that counsel &quot;rendered\r\n  adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of\r\n  reasonable professional judgment.&quot; Â Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.Â  Accordingly, when counsel articulates a valid reason for employing a certain\r\n  strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel. Â Caprood\r\n    v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 110, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).Â  \r\nIn Dawkins,\r\n  this Court rejected the PCR court's finding that trial counsel had a valid strategic\r\n  reason for not objecting to the introduction of impermissible hearsay: \r\n\r\n  The testimony\r\n    of the four witnesses relating what [the Victim] told them regarding her\r\n    alleged sexual abuse served only to bolster her credibility. Â This case hinged\r\n    on whether [the Victim] was credible. Â The improper corroboration of [the\r\n    Victim's] allegation of sexual abuse by several witnesses thus had a\r\n    'devastating impact' on petitioner's trial. Â Counsel's failure to object\r\n    because he did not want to confuse or upset the jury does not constitute valid\r\n    strategy. \r\n\r\n346 S.C. at 157, 551 S.E.2d at\r\n  263.Â  The Court added that counsel's trial strategy &quot;was inappropriate\r\n  especially given the fact there was not overwhelming evidence that petitioner\r\n  sexually abused [the Victim].&quot; Â Id., 551 S.E.2d at 263.Â  The Court\r\n  concluded: &quot;[C]ounsel did not articulate a valid strategy for failing to\r\n  object to the testimony.Â  Accordingly, we find petitioner is entitled to a new\r\n  trial because he was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance.&quot; Â Id.,\r\n  551 S.E.2d at 263. Compare Watson v. State, 370 S.C. 68, 634\r\n  S.E.2d 642 (2006) (finding trial counsel had articulated a valid strategy for\r\n  not objecting to the corroborative and impermissible hearsay where counsel\r\n  reasonably believed that objecting to the corroborative testimony could lead to\r\n  the introduction of more damaging evidence).Â  \r\n\r\nC.\r\nPetitioner Has Demonstrated Ineffective\r\n  Assistance of Counsel\r\nThe forensic interviewer's testimony substantially\r\n  exceeded the limitations of time and place set forth in Rule 801(d)(1)(D),\r\n  SCRE.Â  The presumption of adequate representation based on a valid trial\r\n  strategy disappears when trial counsel acknowledged there was no trial\r\n  strategy in mind when he failed to object to the improper hearsay and\r\n  bolstering testimony.Â  Moreover, we can discern no defensible basis for trial\r\n  counsel's failure to challenge the forensic interviewer's objectionable\r\n  testimony.Â  The evidence in the record suggests that trial counsel was\r\n  deficient, thereby satisfying the first prong of Strickland.Â  \r\nWe next consider whether counsel's deficient\r\n  performance resulted in prejudice to Smith.Â  Having carefully reviewed the\r\n  entire transcript of the underlying trial, we find Smith was prejudiced by\r\n  trial counsel's deficient performance.Â  The contrary determination by the PCR\r\n  court has no evidentiary support in the record.Â  \r\nWe find this case strikingly similar to Dawkins.Â \r\n  Here, as in Dawkins, the outcome of the case hinged on the Victim's\r\n  credibility regarding identification of the perpetrator, and there was otherwise\r\n  an absence of overwhelming evidence of Smith's guilt.Â  The forensic\r\n  interviewer's hearsay testimony impermissibly corroborated the Victim's\r\n  identification of Smith as the assailant, and the forensic interviewer's\r\n  subsequent opinion testimony improperly bolstered the Victim's credibility.\r\nThe State relied heavily on the forensic interviewer's\r\n  testimony to overcome inconsistencies in the Victim's testimony.Â  In its\r\n  closing argument to the jury, the State highlighted the forensic interviewer's\r\n  testimony:\r\n\r\n  Well, Ginger Gist talked to\r\n    [the Victim].Â  She's the forensic interviewer if you recall.Â  . . .Â  And she\r\n    determines in her opinion [the Victim] is believable.Â  Says she's examined\r\n    many, many children and you know sometimes you just can't believe them.Â  But\r\n    she said she believed [the Victim].Â  Believed what [the Victim] told her.Â  \r\n\r\nThere\r\n  is no valid claim of overwhelming evidence of Smith's guilt.Â  Even the State\r\n  acknowledged in its brief that &quot;there was a great deal of conflicting\r\n  testimony from virtually every State and defense witness who testified at\r\n  trial.&quot;Â  Moreover, in addressing Smith at sentencing, the trial judge\r\n  commented on the conflicting testimony: &quot;I'm not giving you the maximum\r\n  sentence in this matter.Â  I'm not sure what all went on in this case.Â  There is\r\n  a lot of confusion as to the stories that were told by many of the\r\n  witnesses.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State's concession and the trial court's observation support our conclusion\r\n  that Smith was prejudiced by deficient representation at trial and that confidence\r\n  in the outcome was thereby undermined.Â  \r\nV.\r\nBecause trial counsel was deficient in failing to\r\n  object to the improper hearsay and bolstering testimony, and because this\r\n  deficiency prejudiced the outcome of Smith's trial, we reverse the denial of\r\n  post-conviction relief.Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  In my view, the PCR court's denial of Petitioner's application should\r\n  be affirmed.\r\nThe PCR court's\r\n  ruling should be upheld if it is supported by any evidence of probative value\r\n  in the record.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â \r\n  In my view, trial counsel's performance was not deficient.Â  Nonetheless, even\r\n  if it was deficient, Petitioner suffered no prejudice.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  my opinion, the PCR court correctly found that trial counsel articulated a\r\n  valid trial strategy consistent with his failure to object to the inadmissible\r\n  hearsay testimony at issue.Â  This finding is supported by trial counsel's\r\n  testimony and should be affirmed.Â  See Watson v. State, 370 S.C. 68, 73,\r\n  634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006) (holding that where trial counsel articulates\r\n  &quot;a valid reason for failing to object to . . . hearsay testimony,&quot; he\r\n  has not performed deficiently with respect to the lack of objection).\r\n Nonetheless, even\r\n  if trial counsel's performance was deficient, Petitioner suffered no\r\n  prejudice.Â  In my view, the State presented overwhelming evidence of\r\n  Petitioner's guilt.[2]Â \r\n  Therefore, it is not reasonably probable that the result of Petitioner's trial\r\n  would have been different absent counsel's alleged deficient performance. See Cherry,\r\n  300 S.C. 117-18, 386 S.E.2d at 625 (holding that a PCR applicant has shown\r\n  prejudice where he is able to show &quot;a reasonable probability that, but for\r\n  counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\r\n  different.&quot;). \r\nFor these reasons,\r\n  I would affirm the PCR court's denial of Petitioner's application.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n[1] State\r\n  v.

Johnson, pro se, of Columbia\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: Â In this disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary\r\n    Counsel (ODC) brought formal charges against Respondent Charles E. Johnson arising\r\n  out of his alleged neglect of a client's case and his failure to follow proper\r\n  procedures in numerous real estate closings.Â  In one particular closing, ODC\r\n  alleged Respondent was not present at the closing.Â  In another closing, ODC\r\n  alleged Respondent was responsible for a real estate transaction involving\r\n  mortgage fraud.Â  A Hearing Panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (&quot;the\r\n  Panel&quot;) found ODC's allegations to be true and recommended an indefinite\r\n  suspension as a result of the misconduct.Â  We agree with the Panel in\r\n  substantial part, but we find ODC failed to meet its burden of proof that\r\n  Respondent actively participated in the transaction involving\r\n  mortgage fraud.Â  Based on the proven misconduct, we suspend Respondent for one\r\n  year from the practice of law.\r\nI.\r\na. Longwood Matter\r\nOn February 20,\r\n  1998, Pamela Longwood and Beverly Sumter retained an associate with\r\n  Respondent's firm to represent them regarding an automobile accident that had occurred\r\n  just days prior.Â  Longwood and Sumter, who are cousins, informed the associate\r\n  that they were involved in an accident with James Usher and that Sumter was the\r\n  driver and Longwood was her passenger.Â  Subsequently, the associate left\r\n  Respondent's firm, and Respondent assumed representation in May 1999.Â  In July\r\n  1999, Usher filed suit against Sumter, the at-fault driver.Â  As a result of\r\n  this suit, Respondent learned of a potential conflict of interest between\r\n  Sumter and Longwood and terminated his representation of Sumter.Â  In April\r\n  2001, two months after the expiration of the statute of limitations, Respondent\r\n  filed suit against Usher and Sumter, despite Longwood's continued instructions\r\n  not to file suit against her cousin.[1]Â  The case was dismissed\r\n  as time-barred.Â  \r\nb. Cantey Closing Matter\r\nAmanda Cantey\r\n  purchased a home in which her father, Amos Price, was the co-signor.Â \r\n  Respondent served as the closing attorney, and Joseph Wright served as the\r\n  broker.Â  The closing documents indicated that the closing took place on October\r\n  2, 2001.Â  ODC alleged Respondent could not have been present at the closing at\r\n  his office in Columbia because he was attending the public defenders conference\r\n  in Myrtle Beach on this date.Â  \r\nc. Amos Price/Joseph\r\n  Wright Matter\r\nOn\r\n  November 29, 2001, approximately two months after the Cantey closing, Respondent\r\n  conducted a closing on a $340,000 home located in the Spring Valley subdivision\r\n  in Columbia.Â  The HUD statement indicated that Amos Price, Cantey's father, was\r\n  the borrower and the purchaser of the home.Â  In 2003, the mortgage company\r\n  began contacting Price regarding his failure to make mortgage payments on the\r\n  Spring Valley home.Â  Price and his family informed the mortgage company that he\r\n  had not purchased the home, and he did not know how or why the mortgage was\r\n  listed under his name.Â  \r\nAn investigation revealed that Joseph Wright, the\r\n  broker involved in the Cantey closing, had assumed Amos Price's identity and\r\n  had moved into the home.Â  Wright was indicted for financial identity fraud and\r\n  pled guilty to forgery.Â  ODC alleged Respondent knowingly participated, either\r\n  directly or indirectly, in the fraudulent transaction.Â  \r\nd. Various Real Estate\r\n  Closing Matters\r\nODC examined a number of Respondent's files\r\n  involving real estate closings.Â  ODC presented HUD statements and disbursement\r\n  statements from thirteen unrelated closings conducted by Respondent to the\r\n  Panel.Â  The statements contained numerous and significant financial\r\n  discrepancies. \r\nII.\r\nAt the hearing\r\n  before the Panel, Sumter and Longwood testified that Respondent never warned\r\n  them of the potential conflict of interest.Â  Moreover, Sumter testified that\r\n  Respondent did not obtain her consent to sue her despite her status as a former\r\n  client.Â  Longwood testified that she had specifically instructed Respondent not\r\n  to sue Sumter and never directed him otherwise.\r\nRegarding the\r\n  Cantey closing, Amanda Cantey testified that Respondent was not at the closing\r\n  on October 2, 2001.Â  Cantey stated that she, her husband, Wright, and Beulah\r\n  Stallings, who is Respondent's secretary and sister, were the only individuals\r\n  present at the closing.Â  She testified she had never been to Respondent's\r\n  office prior to this closing and that only one meeting took place.Â  Cantey\r\n  further testified the signatures on the documents relating to the Spring Valley\r\n  closing were not her father's signatures, her father was not involved in the Spring Valley home purchase, and he was unaware of Wright's actions.[2]Â  \r\nODC called Wright\r\n  to testify as to the Price/Wright matter.Â  He testified that he had received\r\n  the loan closing documents from the lender and then compiled the forged\r\n  documents prior to the closing.Â  He admitted that he had contacted Amanda\r\n  Cantey and Amos Price and falsely told them he needed to make another copy of\r\n  Price's driver's license for the Cantey file.Â  Wright stated that the closing\r\n  took place in Respondent's office and Respondent was not present, but Stallings\r\n  was present at the closing.Â  Wright maintained that he acted alone in forging\r\n  the documents and neither Respondent nor Stallings had knowledge of his\r\n  scheme.Â  Respondent declined to cross-examine Wright.Â  \r\nAs to the various\r\n  real estate closings that ODC examined, ODC called Andrew Syrett to testify.Â \r\n  Syrett served as the seller's attorney and Respondent represented the buyer in\r\n  a transaction in which the buyer had been renting the home on a lease/purchase\r\n  contract.Â  Syrett testified Respondent drafted a HUD statement indicating a\r\n  refinancing transaction, yet the transaction was clearly a purchase\r\n  transaction.Â  Syrett testified that Respondent prepared an incorrect HUD\r\n  statement and an incorrect deed.Â  Syrett instructed his client not to sign\r\n  either document, and he subsequently redrafted the documents correctly.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition to witness testimony, ODC submitted HUD and disbursement statements\r\n  from twelve other real estate closings, all of which contained numerous\r\n  financial discrepancies and inaccuracies.Â  In essence, the files contained HUD\r\n  statements which did not match the disbursement sheets and did not match the\r\n  checks drawn on Respondent's trust account.Â  The documents included inaccurate\r\n  numbers for cash advanced to the borrower, processing fees, and the price of\r\n  the homes.[3]\r\nStallings testified\r\n  on Respondent's behalf at the hearing.Â  Concerning the Cantey closing, she\r\n  maintained all the parties were present and had executed the closing documents\r\n  at a &quot;dry closing&quot; that took place the Friday before October 2.[4]Â \r\n  Stallings also testified as to the Price/Wright matter.Â  She stated Wright\r\n  arrived at Respondent's office with a man she believed to be Amos Price, she\r\n  made copies of the driver's license that he presented to her, which indicated\r\n  he was Amos Price, and she recognized the man as Amos Price from the October 2\r\n  closing.Â  Stallings testified Wright did not bring in pre-signed documents\r\n  because &quot;[Wright] know[s] we wouldn't do that.&quot;Â  She further\r\n  testified that she witnessed the man sign &quot;Amos Price&quot; on the\r\n  documents.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Respondent testified.Â  He admitted he neglected Longwood's case in failing to\r\n  file her claim within the statute of limitations.Â  However, he claimed he\r\n  drafted pleadings in February 2001, but Longwood refused to come to his office\r\n  to review them.Â  He indicated the reason he knowingly filed the claim outside\r\n  the statute of limitations was because he thought he may be able to obtain a\r\n  settlement offer from the insurance company.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  admitted he was in Myrtle Beach on October 2 and acknowledged that the closing\r\n  could not possibly have occurred on that date.Â  Respondent testified that,\r\n  although he could not recall what exactly transpired, &quot;the only thing [he]\r\n  can think of&quot; was that a dry closing took place the Friday before in which\r\n  the parties executed the documents.[5]\r\nRegarding\r\n  the Price/Wright closing, Respondent insisted that Wright brought in a man who\r\n  purported to be Amos Price.Â  Respondent testified that Wright told him Price\r\n  was his grandfather and that Price intended to purchase the home for Wright's\r\n  use.Â  He too asserted that he recognized Price from the Cantey closing and that\r\n  the man brought in a driver's license indicating he was Amos Price.Â  Respondent\r\n  could not offer an explanation as to why Wright &quot;lied&quot; to the Panel\r\n  in saying he brought pre-signed documents to the closing.Â  On\r\n  cross-examination, Respondent admitted he was &quot;shocked&quot; that Amos\r\n  Price was approved for a loan for $340,000 for the Spring Valley home after\r\n  co-signing on Cantey's loan just a month earlier.Â  Similarly, at oral argument,\r\n  Respondent acknowledged that he was concerned with the nature of this\r\n  transaction from an economic standpoint.Â  \r\nThe Panel found\r\n  that Respondent's actions in failing to file suit on behalf of Longwood within\r\n  the statute of limitations and in suing Sumter against Longwood's instructions\r\n  constituted misconduct.Â  Regarding the Cantey closing, the Panel found clear\r\n  and convincing evidence that Respondent allowed a non-lawyer to conduct a real\r\n  estate closing, to sign his name to the HUD document, and to notarize a\r\n  document bearing his signature that falsely reflected that he was present on\r\n  October 2.Â  As to the Price/Wright matter, the Panel noted that this matter was\r\n  most troubling to the Panel and that it was a question of credibility.Â  The\r\n  Panel found by clear and convincing evidence that Wright committed fraud by\r\n  forging the closing documents and obtaining a loan in Price's name and found\r\n  that Price was not present at the closing.Â  The Panel ruled that by allowing\r\n  criminal activity to occur in his office, Respondent violated the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct.Â  Finally, regarding the thirteen closings containing\r\n  inaccurate HUD and disbursement statements, the Panel noted that although there\r\n  were no allegations of misappropriation of funds, the transactions did\r\n  implicate Respondent's trust account and found that Respondent's actions in\r\n  this matter constituted misconduct.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nThis Court has the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to\r\n  decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record.Â  In re Thompson,\r\n  343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  We â€œmay\r\n  accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings, conclusions and\r\n  recommendations of the [Panel].â€Â  Rule 27(e)(2), Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  While this Court may\r\n  draw its own conclusions and make its own findings of fact in an attorney\r\n  disciplinary matter, the unanimous findings and conclusions of the Panel are\r\n  entitled to much respect and consideration.Â  In re Thompson, 343\r\n  S.C. at 11, 539 S.E.2d at 401.Â  ODC carries the burden of proof and most prove misconduct by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.Â  Rule 8, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nRespondent challenges the Panel's findings as to all\r\n  four matters.Â  Specifically, Respondent claims there was not clear and\r\n  convincing evidence to support the allegations in the Price/Wright matter,\r\n  there was no testimony contradicting his version of the Cantey closing, and the\r\n  Panel's report contains no allegations of misconduct in the thirteen real\r\n  estate closings.Â  While he admits he violated Rule 1.3 (diligence) of the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, in the Longwood matter, he claims the\r\n  Panel's further findings of misconduct related to this matter are not supported\r\n  by clear and convincing evidence and the proper sanction is an admonition.Â  \r\nWe find that\r\n  Respondent's actions in the Longwood matter violated the rules on conflicts of\r\n  interest as well as the rules on competence and diligence.Â  Longwood and Sumter\r\n  made a full disclosure to Respondent regarding the accident.Â  Respondent should\r\n  have informed Sumter and Longwood of the potential conflict of interest before he\r\n  agreed to represent both of them.Â  Respondent clearly neglected this matter by\r\n  filing Longwood's suit after the statute of limitations had expired and by\r\n  filing it against Sumter in direct contravention to Longwood's instructions.Â \r\n  We give no credence to Respondent's assertion that Longwood refused to come to\r\n  his office to review the pleadings, for it was Respondent's responsibility toÂ  ensure\r\n  that his client review the pleadings before the eve of the expiration of the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  \r\nNext, we find that\r\n  Respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in the Cantey closing.Â \r\n  We agree with the Panel's findings that Respondent allowed a non-lawyer to\r\n  conduct a real estate closing and sign his name to a HUD statement.Â  We find\r\n  that Respondent's and Stallings' assertion regarding a prior &quot;dry\r\n  closing&quot; lacks credibility.Â  Neither Respondent nor Stallings mentioned a\r\n  dry closing in their testimony at the Notice to Appear hearing.Â  Cantey\r\n  unequivocally testified that she went to Respondent's office only one time, Respondent\r\n  was not present, and there had been no dry closing.Â  Regardless of any\r\n  purported dry closing, Respondent allowed Stallings to notarize a document\r\n  indicating that Respondent was present on October 2, when in fact, he was not.Â  \r\nIn our view, the Price/Wright\r\n  matter is extremely troubling and is the most serious of the allegations.Â  As\r\n  stated above, we find Cantey's testimony that Respondent was not present at her\r\n  closing is credible.Â  Thus, Respondent would likely not be in a position to\r\n  identify Amos Price.Â  Moreover, one could reasonably question why Wright would\r\n  provide false testimony, before the Panel and at his guilty plea, by asserting\r\n  that he brought pre-signed documents to the closing.Â  In both proceedings,\r\n  Wright's testimony was consistent, and he openly admitted his actions.Â  Wright\r\n  did not shift blame or implicate anyone but himself and consistently maintained\r\n  that neither Respondent nor Stallings was involved in or aware of his\r\n  fraudulent scheme to assume Amos Price's identity.[6]Â \r\n  In our view, Stallings' and Respondent's version of events is problematic, yet\r\n  we must examine the evidence through the lens of the clear and convincing\r\n  standard.Â  \r\nApplying this\r\n  heightened standard, we find that ODC did not meet its burden of proving the\r\n  allegation that Respondent actively participated in this fraudulent scheme.Â \r\n  Neither Respondent nor Stallings was ever indicted for any offense arising out\r\n  of this matter, and the only evidence ODC presented in support of this\r\n  allegation was Wright's testimony.Â  In our view, this does not rise to a level\r\n  of clear and convincing evidence that Respondent was an active participant in\r\n  the fraud and forgeries.Â  While we do not overlook or disregard the undisputed\r\n  fact that serious criminal conduct occurred in Respondent's office, we do not\r\n  find that ODC established Respondentâ€™s knowing participation in the fraudulent\r\n  scheme.Â  We view Respondentâ€™s conduct in line with his general slack and casual\r\n  approach to real estate closings, perhaps explaining Wright's choice of\r\n  Respondent as the closing attorney for his fraudulent scheme.Â  \r\nFinally, we agree\r\n  with the Panel's finding that the numerous inaccurate closing documents reflect\r\n  Respondent's loose approach in the handling of real estate closings.Â  The HUD\r\n  statements and disbursement sheets reflected incorrect, inaccurate, and\r\n  sometimes missing important information.Â  This court takes real estate\r\n  transactions very seriously, and we have consistently issued harsh sanctions\r\n  against attorneys who do not conduct closings in accordance with proper\r\n  procedures.Â  See In re Moore, 382 S.C. 610, 677 S.E.2d 598 (2009)\r\n  (suspending attorney for one year for failing to follow proper procedures in\r\n  real estate closings); In re Hall, 370 S.C. 496, 636 S.E.2d 621 (2006)\r\n  (imposing a nine-month suspension where lawyer served as the senior South\r\n  Carolina attorney for a national title agency company that conducted closing\r\n  which did not follow proper closing procedures).Â  Moreover, not only did\r\n  Respondent's files indicate failure to follow proper closing procedures, they\r\n  also reflected failure to properly maintain his trust account.Â  In our view,\r\n  this evidence establishes a consistent pattern of negligence, inattention,\r\n  failure to supervise, and an overall cavalier attitude and approach to real\r\n  estate transactions, his client's interests, and the practice of law.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  recognize that this disciplinary matter was highly contentious.Â  We commend the\r\n  Panel for conducting a thorough hearing and completing a careful assessment in\r\n  making their fact-finding determinations.\r\nV.\r\nBy\r\n  his misconduct in the Longwood matter, we find Respondent violated the\r\n  following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: 1.1 (competence); 1.2\r\n  (scope of representation); 1.3 (diligence); 1.7 (lawyer shall not represent a\r\n  client if representation is adverse to another client's interests unless both\r\n  clients consent); and 1.9 (lawyer owes a duty of loyalty to former clients).Â \r\n  As to the Cantey closing, we find Respondent violated the following Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct Rule 407, SCACR: 1.1 (competence); 1.3 (diligence); 5.3\r\n  (addressing responsibilities for non-lawyer assistants); 5.5 (lawyer shall not\r\n  assist another in the unauthorized practice of law); and 8.4(a) and (e) (lawyer\r\n  shall not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or engage in conduct that\r\n  is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Lastly, regarding the\r\n  thirteen real estate closings containing inaccurate closing documents, we find\r\n  Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR: 1.1 (competence); 1.3 (diligence); 4.1(a) (lawyer shall not make a false\r\n  statement of material fact to third persons); 5.3 (addressing responsibilities\r\n  for non-lawyer assistants); and 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).\r\nAs to mitigating\r\n  factors, we have considered the fact that Respondent was admitted to the South\r\n  Carolina Bar in 1985 and has no prior disciplinary history.Â  Additionally, as\r\n  noted above, Respondent was not indicted as a result of the Price/Wright\r\n  matter.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold that a sanction of a one year definite suspension is warranted in light of\r\n  Respondent's misconduct, especially his neglect in supervising real estate\r\n  transactions.Â  In issuing this sanction, we especially considered the fact that\r\n  serious criminal conduct was so easily perpetrated in his office while under\r\n  his watch and control.Â  See In re Johnson, 375 S.C. 499, 654 S.E.2d 272\r\n  (2007) (issuing a definite suspension of one year\r\n  where attorney unknowingly assisted others in perpetrating real estate fraud by\r\n  failing to adequately investigate the facts surrounding the circumstances of\r\n  the loans); In re Helton, 372 S.C. 245, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  573 (2007) (indefinitely suspending a lawyer who allowed\r\n  closings to be conducted by his non-lawyer assistants, was not present when the\r\n  closing documents were executed, improperly witnessed documents, and failed to\r\n  review the closing documents).\r\nRespondent\r\n  has exhibited a pattern of a careless\r\n  approach to real estate closings.Â  Accordingly, we suspend Respondent for one\r\n  year effective the date of this opinion and direct Respondent to pay the costs\r\n  of these proceedings.Â  We further order Respondent to participate in the LEAP\r\n  program.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent attempted to serve Sumter, but the pleadings were returned for non-service.Â  \r\n[2] Amos Price was deceased by the time this\r\n  hearing was held.Â  \r\n[3] The amount of the inaccuracies ranged from\r\n  hundreds to thousands of dollars.Â  Wright acted as the mortgage broker in\r\n  several of these closings.\r\n[4] According to Respondent, a &quot;dry closing&quot; is\r\n  a closing where the documents are executed, but funds are not exchanged and the\r\n  property is not transferred until days later.Â  On cross-examination, ODC\r\n  pointed out that Stallings never mentioned a dry closing in her testimony at\r\n  the Notice to Appear hearing.Â  \r\n[5] Similar to Stallings' testimony, ODC pointed\r\n  out that Respondent also never mentioned a dry closing in his testimony at the\r\n  Notice to Appear hearing.\r\n[6] We do not intend to commend Wright for his\r\n  actions or to excuse his criminal conduct.Â  We are examining and analyzing\r\n  Wright's testimony solely for the purpose of ascertaining how a criminal was\r\n  able to perpetrate serious mortgage fraud involving identity theft in a\r\n  lawyer's office.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26775","title":"Camp v.

Camp, 378 S.C. 237, 662 S.E.2d 458 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nFather\r\n  and Theresa H. Camp (Mother) are the parents of William James Camp (Son), who\r\n  was born September 22, 1987.Â  Father and Mother divorced in 2003.Â  In 2005, Son\r\n  began attending the University of South Carolina.Â  The divorce decree did not\r\n  address the issue of the parties' respective financial responsibilities for Son's\r\n  college education.Â  Although Mother and Son sought financial assistance from\r\n  Father, Father refused to assist with Son's college expenses. \r\nThereafter,\r\n  Mother and Son (Respondents) filed suit against Father seeking contribution\r\n  toward Son's college education.Â  On August 1, 2006, the family court filed an\r\n  order directing Father to pay seventy percent of Son's college tuition, fees,\r\n  and associated expenses.Â  The family court also awarded Respondents attorney's\r\n  fees in the amount of $4,000.00.\r\nOn\r\n  August 11, 2006, Father filed a motion for reconsideration which stated, in its\r\n  entirety:\r\n\r\n  PLEASE be advised that the Defendant through his undersigned\r\n    attorney, will move before the Honorable David Sawyer, Jr., to reconsider the\r\n    ruling in his Order dated July 26, 2006, in awarding Plaintiff, William James\r\n    Camp's college expenses and costs.\r\n  This motion hearing is set to be heard on the 18th day of October,\r\n    2006, at 3:45 o'clock, p.m.\r\n  Please be present to defend if so minded.Â  \r\n\r\nThere was no\r\n  accompanying brief in support of the motion.Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  filed a memorandum in response to this motion on October, 16 2006.Â  Respondents\r\n  argued, inter alia, that Father's motion failed to state with\r\n  particularity the grounds upon which the motion was based or the specific\r\n  relief sought.Â  Father filed a memorandum in support of the motion for\r\n  reconsideration on October 18, 2006.Â  After a hearing, the family court denied\r\n  Father's motion in an order filed October 26, 2006.[1]Â  \r\nFather\r\n  filed a notice of appeal on November 16, 2006; less than thirty days after the\r\n  family court's denial of the motion for reconsideration, but well over three\r\n  months after the date of the original order.Â  Respondents argued that because\r\n  Father's motion for reconsideration was not valid under the Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure, the motion did not toll the time for filing a notice of appeal, and\r\n  therefore, the appeal was not timely.Â  The court of appeals found the appeal\r\n  untimely and dismissed. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the court of appeals err\r\n    in dismissing the appeal?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis case raises a novel question.Â  In a case that\r\n  raises a novel question of law, we are free to decide the question with no\r\n  particular deference to the lower court.Â  I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt.\r\n    Pleasant,&nbsp;338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718-19&nbsp;(2000).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWhen\r\n  seeking review of a family court's order, a notice of appeal must be served on\r\n  all respondents within thirty days after receipt of written notice of the order\r\n  or judgment.Â  See Rule 203(b)(1) &amp; (3), SCACR.Â  Service of the\r\n  notice of appeal is a &quot;jurisdictional requirement, and this Court has no\r\n  authority to extend or expand the time in which the notice of intent to appeal\r\n  must be served.&quot;Â  Mears v. Mears, 287 S.C. 168, 169, 337 S.E.2d\r\n  206, 207 (1985).Â  A timely post-trial motion, including a motion to alter or\r\n  amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, stays the time for an appeal\r\n  for all parties until receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting\r\n  or denying such motion.Â  Elam v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., 361\r\n  S.C. 9, 15, 602 S.E.2d 772, 775 (2004); Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR; Rule 59(f),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  \r\nRule\r\n  7(b)(1), SCRCP requires that motions &quot;shall state with particularity the\r\n  grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  The particularity requirement &quot;is to be read flexibly in 'recognition of\r\n  the peculiar circumstances of the case.'&quot;Â  Cambridge Plating Co., Inc.\r\n    v. Napco, Inc.,&nbsp;85 F.3d 752, 760&nbsp;(1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Registration\r\n      Control Sys., Inc. v. Compusystems, Inc., 922 F.2d 805, 808 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).[3]Â  &quot;By requiring notice to the court and the\r\n  opposing party of the basis for the motion, rule 7(b)(1) advances the policies\r\n  of reducing prejudice to either party and assuring that 'the court can\r\n  comprehend the basis of the motion and deal with it fairly.'&quot;Â  Calderon\r\n    v. Kansas Dept. of Soc. and Rehab. Servs., 181 F.3d 1180, 1186&nbsp;(10th\r\n  Cir. 1999) (quoting 5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal\r\n    Practice and Procedure Â§ 1192, at 42 (2d ed. 1990)).Â  Therefore, when a\r\n  motion is challenged for a lack of particularity, the court should ask &quot;whether\r\n  any party is prejudiced by a lack of particularity or 'whether the court can\r\n  comprehend the basis for the motion and deal with it fairly.'&quot;Â  Registration\r\n    Control, 922 F.2d at 807-08 (quoting 5 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal\r\n      Practice and Procedure Â§ 1192, at 42).Â  &quot;The particularity requirement\r\n  should not be applied in an overly technical fashion when the purpose behind\r\n  the rule is not jeopardized.&quot;Â  Andreas v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,\r\n  336 F.3d 789, 793 (8th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nBecause the\r\n  particularity requirement is to be read flexibly in light of the peculiar\r\n  circumstances of each case, we do not believe applying the particularity\r\n  requirement in an overly technical fashion in this case would serve the purpose\r\n  behind the rule.Â  Applying an overly technical analysis in this instance would\r\n  not reduce prejudice to either party nor would it assure the court that it\r\n  would be able to deal with the motion fairly.Â  In our view, neither party was\r\n  prejudiced by Father's motion for reconsideration, and it appears from the\r\n  record the court was able to both comprehend the motion and deal with it\r\n  fairly.Â  The trial court's order denying Father's motion for reconsideration\r\n  stated that &quot;[b]ased on the arguments of counsel&quot; the motion was\r\n  denied.Â  Hence, neither party was prejudiced, and the court dealt with the\r\n  motion fairly.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nÂ When\r\n  neither party is prejudiced and the court is able to deal fairly with a motion\r\n  for reconsideration, applying an overly technical reading of the rules does not\r\n  serve the purpose of Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  For these reasons, we reverse the\r\n  court of appeals decision and hold Father's motion for reconsideration tolled\r\nthe time for filing a notice of appeal.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. WALLER, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the Court of Appeals\r\n  properly found Fatherâ€™s motion for\r\n  reconsideration was defective under Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP, and therefore,\r\n  the motion failed to toll the time for filing the notice of appeal.Â \r\n  Accordingly, I would affirm.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals relied on Martinez v. Trainor, 556 F.2d. 818 (7th Cir. 1977).Â   In Martinez, the court found that a one-sentence Rule\r\n  59(e) motion failed to satisfy the particularity\r\n  requirement of Rule 7(b)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P.,[4] because the motion â€œfailed to state even one ground for granting the motion and\r\n  thus failed to meet the minimal standard of â€˜reasonable specification.â€™â€[5] Â Martinez, 556 F.2d at 820 (quoting 2-A Mooreâ€™s\r\n  Federal Practice (3rd ed. 1975).Â  Although the appellant had later\r\n  filed a brief in support of the motion, the Martinez court explained\r\n  that â€œif a party could file a skeleton motion and later fill it in, the purpose\r\n  of the time limitation would be defeated.â€Â  Id.[6]\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals in the instant case reasoned that to permit an insufficient post-trial\r\n  motion to toll the time for filing an appeal would allow a litigant â€œto buy\r\n  time without asserting a meritorious claimâ€ which in turn would â€œfurther\r\n  neither justice nor efficiency.â€Â  Camp v. Camp, 378 S.C. at 242, 662\r\n  S.E.2d at 461.Â  Moreover, the Court of Appeals recognized that Father not only\r\n  failed to specify the grounds for the motion for reconsideration, but failed to\r\n  identify the relief that was sought.Â  The Court of Appeals therefore stated the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n  Our\r\n    rules clearly state the requirements for motions and for appeals.Â  Permitting a\r\n    post-trial motion that identifies neither the grounds on which it relies nor\r\n    the relief sought to stay the time for appeal under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, would\r\n    undermine our procedural rules. Â Moreover, it would encourage parties to file\r\n    baseless post-trial motions with the expectation of â€œfilling in the blanksâ€ at\r\n    a later date.\r\n\r\nId. at 243, 662 S.E.2d at 461.\r\n I agree with the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis.Â  To allow such patently defective motions to stay\r\n  the time period for filing an appeal would â€œwhittle away at the rules and\r\n  ultimately render them meaningless.â€Â  Riley v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 1 F.3d 725, 727&nbsp;(8th Cir.\r\n  1993).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority concludes that as long as â€œneither party is prejudiced and the court\r\n  is able to deal fairly with a motion for reconsideration,â€ then a skeletal motion\r\n  is proper.Â  I believe this effectively vitiates the plain (and relatively\r\n  undemanding) requirements of the applicable rules of civil procedure.Â  See Rule 7(b)(1), 59(g), SCRCP.Â  Moreover, it will create unnecessary\r\n  fact-intensive inquiries by our appellate courts to determine whether parties\r\n  were - in fact - prejudiced by an insufficient motion.\r\nI\r\n  would affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to dismiss the appeal.\r\n\r\n[1] The issue of the sufficiency of the motion was not mentioned at the hearing\r\n  before the family court.Â  \r\n[2] The federal rule 7(b)(1) is substantively the same as South Carolina's Rule\r\n  7(b)(1). \r\n[3] &quot;'[N]on-particularized motions have been allowed where the opposing party\r\n  knew or had notice of the particular grounds being relied upon.'&quot;Â  Registration\r\n    Control, 922 F.2d at 808 (quoting 2A James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's\r\n      Federal Practice Â¶ 7.05, at 7-16 (1990)). \r\n[4] The federal rule 7(b)(1) is substantively the same as\r\n  South Carolinaâ€™s Rule 7(b)(1).\r\n[5] The motion in Martinez stated as follows:\r\nNOW COMES the Defendant James L. Trainor, Director, ILLINOIS\r\n  DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC AID, by and through his attorney, WILLIAM J. SCOTT,\r\n  Attorney General of Illinois, requests this Honorable Court, pursuant to Rule 59(e) FRCP, to alter,\r\n  amend, or vacate the Declaratory Judgment entered November 11, 1976.\r\n[6] Other federal and state courts are in accord with Martinez.Â  See Intera\r\n  Corp. v. Henderson, 428 F.3d 605, 611&nbsp;(6th Cir. 2005) (â€œA\r\n  party who files a Rule 59(e) motion must comply with the motions filing\r\n  requirements set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b).â€); Talano\r\n    v. Northwestern Med. Faculty Foundation, Inc., 273 F.3d 757, 761&nbsp;(7th Cir. 2001) (a Rule 59(e) motion â€œdevoid of specificityâ€ for its reasons for\r\n  reconsiderationÂ  does not satisfy Rule 7(b)(1), and therefore does not toll the\r\n  time period for filing an appeal); Riley v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,\r\n  1 F.3d 725, 727&nbsp;(8th Cir. 1993) (where the court dismissed for\r\n  lack of appellate jurisdiction and stated that â€œoverlooking the defectâ€ of a\r\n  skeletal motion â€œwould only serve to whittle away at the rules and ultimately\r\n  render them meaningless and unenforceableâ€); Allender v. Raytheon Aircraft\r\n    Co., 439 F.3d 1236, 1240&nbsp;(10th Cir. 2006) (where Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion â€œdid not provide a single ground for relief,â€ it was held insufficient\r\n  and therefore did not toll the time for filing notice of appeal); N.C.\r\n    Alliance for Transp. Reform, Inc. v. N.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 645 S.E.2d\r\n  105&nbsp;(N.C. Ct. App. 2007) (where a Rule 59 motion fails to list the grounds\r\n  on which the motion is based, the time for filing an appeal is not tolled); Schaan\r\n    v. Magic City Beverage Co., 609 N.W.2d 82 (N.D. 2000) (where the court\r\n  deemed invalid a motion for new trial because it was lacking in particularity\r\n  and thus concluded the time for filing an appeal was not tolled).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26776","title":"State v.

Hudgins, of Columbia, for Petitioner/Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  John Boyd Frazier was\r\n  convicted and sentenced for the offenses of murder, conspiracy to commit\r\n  murder, and armed robbery.[1]Â \r\n  The court of appeals affirmed Frazier's murder conviction, but held Frazier was\r\n  entitled to a directed verdict on the armed robbery charge and reversed the\r\n  conviction.Â  State v. Frazier, 375 S.C. 575, 654 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  We hold the trial court properly denied the motion for a directed\r\n  verdict as to both charges, and reinstate the conviction and sentence for armed\r\n  robbery.Â  We, therefore, affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nI.\r\nKimberly\r\n  Renee (Renee) and Brent Poole were married.Â  Renee, an exotic dancer, was\r\n  having an affair with Frazier.Â  The State's theory of the case was that Frazier\r\n  and Renee conspired to murder Brent.[2]\r\nOn\r\n  the night of June 9, 1998, Brent was fatally shot twice in the head at close\r\n  range as he and Renee were walking on the beach in Myrtle Beach. Renee was not\r\n  injured and flagged down an officer patrolling the beach for help.Â  She told\r\n  the officer, &quot;my husband has been shot.&quot;Â  \r\nThe investigation quickly focused on Frazier.Â  The State asserted that Renee\r\n  lured Brent to Myrtle Beach with the pretense of celebrating their\r\n  anniversary.Â  Renee then convinced Brent to take a moonlight romantic stroll on\r\n  the beach where Frazier was waiting to kill Brent.Â  The State further alleged\r\n  that Renee and Frazier staged the murder scene to appear as a robbery.\r\nOn\r\n  June 11, North Carolina police interviewed Frazier at his Winston-Salem, North\r\n  Carolina, home. Â Frazier admitted that he and Renee had an affair but claimed\r\n  the affair had ended when Renee decided to return to her husband.Â  Frazier\r\n  denied any involvement in the murder.Â Â  \r\nFrazier\r\n  admitted that he did not go to work on June 9, telling the officers he called\r\n  in sick.Â  Frazier made no mention of an email he sent to his employer a week\r\n  prior to the murder requesting June 8, 9 and 10 off from work.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Frazier claimed he had not been to Myrtle Beach in many years.Â  The police\r\n  asked Frazier where his vehicle was and Frazier told them he had temporarily\r\n  switched cars with his friend who was a mechanic so that the friend could fix a\r\n  rattling noise in his car.\r\nPolice\r\n  obtained and executed a search warrant for Frazier's home and found a day\r\n  planner which had several notations indicating dates on which he had plans with\r\n  Renee.Â  Significantly, on June 9, the day planner had the notation &quot;Renee\r\n  and Brent.&quot;Â  The evidence revealed that Renee and Frazier's affair\r\n  continued after the date he told police it had ended. \r\nThe\r\n  day following the crime, Mark and Donna Hobbs contacted the Myrtle Beach\r\n  authorities.Â  The Hobbses were visiting Myrtle Beach and learned of the murder\r\n  from the media.Â  On the night of the murder, at approximately midnight, the\r\n  Hobbses observed a suspicious man in dark clothing outside of their hotel.Â  The\r\n  man looked at them and turned away and walked quickly to the beach.Â  Although\r\n  Donna was frightened, the couple walked towards the beach.Â  They again spotted\r\n  the man crouched behind the motel and made eye contact with him.Â  The man then\r\n  proceeded to walk north, parallel to the beach.Â  Brent was murdered shortly\r\n  thereafter in the vicinity of where the Hobbses saw the suspicious man.Â  Mark\r\n  and Donna Hobbs separately identified Frazier as the suspicious man in a\r\n  photographic lineup.\r\n\r\nFrazier\r\n  was indicted for murder, conspiracy to commit murder and armed robbery.[3]\r\nÂ At\r\n  trial, the State presented witnesses who testified that Renee and Frazier had\r\n  been having an ongoing affair and that Frazier's vehicle was often seen parked\r\n  outside of the Poole home, including the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday before\r\n  the murder.Â  Bruce Wolford, a friend of Frazier, and a bartender at the Silver\r\n  Fox where Renee worked, testified Frazier tried to fight Brent on May 30 in the\r\n  parking lot of the Silver Fox.Â  Wolford also overheard Renee telling Frazier of\r\n  her plans to go to Myrtle Beach with Brent on June 9.Â  Kahle Schettler, the\r\n  mechanic friend of Frazier, testified he let Frazier borrow his car on June 8\r\n  and Frazier returned the car on June 10.Â  Schettler also testified Frazier\r\n  called him after the police had questioned Frazier regarding the murder and\r\n  told Schettler &quot;it would be a great help to him and his attorney if\r\n  [Schettler] knew if [the car had] a small amount of miles or not.&quot;Â \r\n  Frazier's boss verified an email sent on June 2 to him from Frazier, in which\r\n  Frazier requested June 8, 9, and 10 off from work.Â  Frazier's boss testified\r\n  that he gave Frazier permission to take those days off.Â  Mark and Donna Hobbs\r\n  testified and identified Frazier as the individual they saw lurking in the\r\n  vicinity just prior to the murder. \r\nThe\r\n  State also presented evidence that police found a wedding ring, a Swiss Army\r\n  knife, cigarettes, and 39 cents near Brent's body at the murder scene.Â \r\n  Additionally, police found $50.73 in cash and a sales receipt dated 10:34 p.m.,\r\n  June 9 from Fast Eddie's, a restaurant, in Brent's pockets.Â  Renee and Brent\r\n  had been at Fast Eddie's shortly before the murder.Â  On July 5, nearly a month\r\n  after the murder, Brent's wallet was found in the yard of a residence several\r\n  blocks from the crime scene.Â  The wallet was soaking wet and contained $9 in\r\n  cash, Brent's driver's license, and the ATM card which had been used to pay the\r\n  bill at Fast Eddie's.Â  \r\nThe jury found\r\n  Frazier guilty on all counts.Â  The court of appeals held the trial court\r\n  properly denied Frazier's motion for a directed verdict on the murder charge\r\n  and affirmed the conviction.Â  However, the court of appeals found the evidence\r\n  did not rise above the level of mere suspicion that Frazier committed an armed\r\n  robbery and reversed the conviction.Â  We granted both Frazier's and the State's\r\n  petitions for a writ of certiorari.\r\nII.\r\nIf there is any direct evidence or substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  the Court must find the case was\r\n  properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292-93,\r\n  625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed\r\n  verdict, an appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in\r\n  the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  The trial judge should\r\n  grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the\r\n  accused is guilty.Â  State v. Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620, 624, 677 S.E.2d\r\n  603, 605 (2009).Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;\r\nMurder\r\nFrazier\r\n  argues the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court's denial of his\r\n  motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to present evidence\r\n  placing him at the murder scene.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe hold the State\r\n  presented substantial circumstantial evidence of guilt, including: Frazier and\r\n  Renee's ongoing affair; Brent was shot twice at point-blank range, yet Renee\r\n  was unharmed; Wolford overheard Renee and Frazier discussing the trip to Myrtle\r\n  Beach; Frazier requested June 8, 9 and 10 off from work a week prior to the\r\n  date of the murder (although Frazier told police he had not been to work on the\r\n  date of the murder because he was sick); Frazier borrowed Schettler's car from\r\n  June 8-10; Frazier tried to fight Brent days before the murder; and the Hobbses\r\n  observed Frazier lurking around the murder scene just before the murder was\r\n  committed and both independently identified Frazier in a photographic lineup.Â \r\n  This evidence, when viewed collectively, presented a jury question as to\r\n  Frazier's guilt.Â  \r\nFrazier cites to State\r\n  v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 605 S.E.2d 529 (2004), State v. Martin, 340\r\n  S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000), and State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322\r\n  S.E.2d 450 (1984) for the proposition that the trial court must grant a\r\n  directed verdict if the State fails to present evidence placing the defendant\r\n  at the scene of the crime.Â  In our view, Frazier overstates the holdings in\r\n  these cases.Â  In Arnold, Martin, and Schrock we held that\r\n  the State did not produce substantial circumstantial evidence of the\r\n  defendant's guilt and noted that the State presented no evidence that\r\n  the defendant was at the scene.Â  We reject any interpretation that these cases\r\n  altered or increased the sufficiency of evidence standard a trial court is to\r\n  apply in a case based on circumstantial evidence.Â  In this case, unlike Arnold, Martin, and Schrock, the State offered substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence of Frazier's guilt.Â  We agree with the court of appeals that Frazier's\r\n  directed verdict motion on the murder charge was properly denied.Â Â Â  \r\nArmed Robbery\r\nThe State contends the court of appeals erred in\r\n  reversing Frazier's conviction for armed robbery.Â  We agree.\r\nArmed robbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful\r\n  taking of money, goods, or other personal property of any value from the person\r\n  of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.Â  State\r\n    v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 398, 472 S.E.2d 241, 241 (1996).Â  Robbery is the crime of larceny\r\n  accomplished with force, and armed robbery occurs when a person commits\r\n  robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.Â  State v. Keith, 283 S.C. 597,\r\n  598, 325 S.E.2d 325, 325-26 (1985); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(a) (2008).\r\nA court is not\r\n  required to analyze an armed robbery and a homicide as two completely\r\n  independent events.Â  A defendant may be found guilty of armed robbery in\r\n  conjunction with a homicide if the death and the robbery are a part of a\r\n  continuous chain of events so interconnected as to be inseparable.Â  See 77\r\n  C.J.S. Robbery Â§ 9 (1994) (&quot;Although, as an\r\n  abstract principle of law, one ordinarily cannot be guilty of robbery if the\r\n  victim is a deceased person, this principle does not apply where a robbery and\r\n  homicide are a part of the same transaction and are so interwoven with each\r\n  other as to be inseparable.&quot;).\r\nWe hold substantial circumstantial evidence exists to\r\n  support the armed robbery charge.Â  The State submitted evidence that Brent's\r\n  wallet was found a month after the murder in a yard blocks from the murder\r\n  scene, a receipt found in Brent's pocket showed that Brent used his ATM card\r\n  the night of the murder, and the ATM card was found in the wallet.Â \r\n  Additionally, a Swiss Army knife, a cigarette pack, coins, and a gold ring were\r\n  all found near Brent's body.Â  \r\nThe totality of the evidence, viewed as a whole,\r\n  establishes substantial circumstantial evidence of the elements of armed\r\n  robbery.Â  Specifically, the evidence supports a reasonable inference that the\r\n  wallet was on Brent just prior to his death and that the gun was used during\r\n  the incident, establishing the elements of force and use of a deadly weapon.Â \r\n  In addition, we find that the items found around Brent also support an inference\r\n  that a robbery had taken place.Â  Furthermore, the evidence shows that the\r\n  homicide and robbery were a part of a continuous, inseparable chain of events.Â \r\n  In sum, the State presented substantial circumstantial evidence that the\r\n  murderer committed an armed robbery, and, as explained above, that Frazier was\r\n  the murderer.Â  See State v. Douglas, 359 S.C. 187, 205, 597 S.E.2d 1, 10\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Douglas, 369 S.C. 424,\r\n  632 S.E.2d 845&nbsp;(2006) (holding the State presented substantial circumstantial evidence that the murder and the taking of\r\n  the property were part of a &quot;single transaction or continuous sequence of\r\n  events&quot; where the victim had been shot five times, his house was ransacked,\r\n  and his wallet was missing).Â  We sustain the armed robbery conviction\r\n  well aware that the taking and carrying away of Brent's wallet was intended to\r\n  mislead police as to real the motive for the murder.Â Â Â  \r\nIV.\r\nWe hold the trial\r\n  court properly denied Frazier's motion for a directed verdict on the murder\r\n  charge and the armed robbery charge.Â  Accordingly, we reverse in part and\r\n  affirm in part the opinion of the court of appeals.Â  \r\nTOAL,Â  C.J.,\r\n  and WALLER, J., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\r\n  in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY (concurring in part and dissenting in part):Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â I concur with the majority in affirming the Court of\r\n  Appeals' upholding of Frazier's conviction for murder.Â  However, I dissent in\r\n  the majority's decision to reverse the Court of Appeals as to the armed robbery\r\n  conviction.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  my view, the Court of Appeals was correct in reversing the armed robbery\r\n  conviction.Â  There is no evidence that a robbery took place, or that if it did\r\n  that the defendant committed it.Â  At best, the evidence in this case merely\r\n  raises a weak suspicion that a robbery occurred.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  evidence showed that:Â  the victim's gold ring was found near his body; victim\r\n  had fifty dollars in his pocket; victim's wallet was found with its contents\r\n  intact weeks later, in a location blocks away from the murder scene; there is\r\n  no evidence that the victim had the wallet at the time of the murder; and there\r\n  is no evidence that anything was taken from the victim.\r\nI\r\n  would dismiss certiorari as improvidently granted.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This was Frazier's second trial.Â  We reversed\r\n  Frazier's first conviction as a result of the trial court's exclusion of\r\n  certain expert evidence proferred by Frazier and the admission of testimony\r\n  against Frazier.Â  State v. Frazier, 357 S.C. 161, 592 S.E.2d 621 (2004).\r\n[2] Brent, Renee, and Frazier were all residents of Winston-Salem, North\r\n  Carolina.Â  \r\n[3] Renee was indicted for the offenses of murder and conspiracy.Â  Renee and\r\n  Frazier were tried separately.Â  Renee gave a statement to police that &quot;she\r\n  and Frazier planned her husband's murder.&quot;Â  State v. Poole,\r\n  2002-UP-029 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 16, 2002).Â  Renee was convicted and\r\n  sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  Renee's confession has no impact on the\r\n  matters before us.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26777","title":"Frantz Pierre v.

Pierre filed a\r\n  claim for workers' compensation benefits, alleging he suffered his injury in\r\n  the course and scope of his employment at Seaside Farms.Â  Pierre asserted the\r\n  accident took place in an employer-owned labor camp, the employer benefited\r\n  from Pierre living at nearby housing, he was required by necessity to live\r\n  there, and the accident occurred in the context of his reasonable use of the\r\n  housing facility as contemplated by the employer.Â  Pierre sought temporary\r\n  total disability compensation from June 5, 2003 to January 31, 2004;\r\n  causally-related medical treatment to date; and future medical treatment,\r\n  including surgery.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  hearing commissioner determined Pierre had not sustained a compensable injury\r\n  because he was not injured during the course and scope of his employment.Â \r\n  Specifically, the hearing commissioner found Pierre &quot;was under no\r\n  requirement to live in the employer provided housing pursuant to his contract\r\n  for employment&quot; and his work did not require that he be on continuous\r\n  call.Â  In addition, he was not engaged in any activities that were calculated\r\n  to further, either directly or indirectly, the business of his employer.Â \r\n  Finally, the wet sidewalk where Pierre fell was not different in character or\r\n  design from other sidewalks, and the risk associated with slipping on the\r\n  sidewalk was not one uniquely associated with his employment; rather, it was\r\n  one he would have been equally exposed to apart from his employment.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Commission's Appellate Panel upheld the hearing commissioner's order and\r\n  incorporated it by reference.Â  However, one member separately wrote to state\r\n  that, although he agreed with the hearing commissioner's refusal to adopt the\r\n  &quot;bunkhouse rule,&quot; he disagreed with the hearing commissioner's\r\n  conclusion that Pierre's accident did not arise out of his employment because\r\n  the sidewalk in question was no different in character or design from any other\r\n  sidewalk.Â  The member stated this was too narrow a reading of the requirement\r\n  that the accident &quot;arise out of&quot; the claimant's employment.Â  \r\nPierre appealed to the circuit court, arguing his accident\r\n  did arise out of and in the course of his employment and that Seaside Farms\r\n  furnished the labor camp housing as part of his compensation.Â  He alleged he\r\n  &quot;was functionally required to live in the . . . labor camp housing for\r\n  lack of [a] reasonable alternative, in view of the distance of the work from\r\n  residential facilities and the lack of availability of accommodations\r\n  elsewhere.&quot;Â  Additionally, &quot;[t]he erratic work schedule described by\r\n  [the] employment contract and in respondent's [Seaside Farm's] deposition testimony,\r\n  indicates that [he] may have been summoned from [the] labor camp housing to\r\n  work in [the] tomato packinghouse facility at odd and irregular hours.&quot;Â  Pierre also alleged the wet sidewalk where he fell was a peculiar hazard to which he was\r\n  exposed only as a result of his employment with Seaside Farms.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court affirmed.Â  The court noted the parties had stipulated that Pierre was an employee under the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act at the time of\r\n  his injury.Â  The court concluded Pierre's accident did not arise out of and in\r\n  the course of his employment with Seaside Farms because he was not performing\r\n  any duties for his employer when the accident occurred.Â  The court stated Pierre's proposed common-law theory of the &quot;bunkhouse rule&quot; was not applicable,\r\n  in any event, as it does not apply when the employee is not required to\r\n  reside in the employer-supplied housing.Â  Pierre appeals.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (APA) provides the standard for judicial review\r\n  of decisions by the Commission.Â  Geathers v. 3V, Inc., 371 S.C. 570, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 29 (2007); Shealy v.

Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â \r\n  An appellate court can reverse or modify the Commission's decision if it is\r\n  affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence in the whole record.Â  Fishburne v.

Bi-Lo, Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981)).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole,\r\n  would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nUnder\r\n  the APA, a reviewing court determines whether the circuit court properly\r\n  determined if the Commissionâ€™s findings of fact are supported by substantial\r\n  evidence in the record and whether the Hearing Panelâ€™s decision is affected by\r\n  an error of law.Â  Geathers, 371 S.C. at 576, 641 S.E.2d at 32.[1]Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA\r\n  claimant may recover workers' compensation benefits if he sustains an\r\n  &quot;injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C.

App. 2007).Â  An accident arises out of the employment when the\r\n  accident happens because of the employment, as when the employment is a contributing proximate cause.Â  Sola v.\r\n    Sunny Slope Farms, 244 S.C. 6, 135 S.E.2d 321 (1964).\r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining if an accident arose out of and in the course of employment, each\r\n  case must be decided with reference to its own attendant circumstances.&quot;Â  Hall,\r\n  376 S.C. at 349, 656 S.E.2d at 759.Â Â  &quot;The general policy in South\r\n  Carolina is to construe the Workers' Compensation Act in favor of coverage, and\r\n  any reasonable doubts as to construction should be resolved in favor of the\r\n  claimant.&quot;Â  Id. at 350, 656 S.E.2d at 759.\r\n&quot;Where\r\n  employer and employee are subject to the compensation act, . . . an injured\r\n  employee should not be excluded from the benefits of the law upon the ground\r\n  that the accident did not arise out of and in the course of his employment when\r\n  there is substantial doubt (arising from the proven facts) of the propriety of\r\n  such conclusion.&quot;Â  Pelfrey v. Oconee County, 207 S.C. 433, 440, 36\r\n  S.E.2d 297, 300&nbsp;(1945).Â  &quot;These words are construed broadly and\r\n  should continue to be so construed.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Common\r\n  sense indicates that a compensation law passed to increase workers' rights\r\n  (because their common law rights were too narrow) should not thereafter be\r\n  narrowly construed.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  finding Pierre's claim was not compensable, the circuit court relied in large\r\n  part upon a North Carolina[2] case, Jauregui v.\r\n    Carolina Vegetables, 436 S.E.2d 268 (N.C. Ct. App. 1993).Â  In Jauregui,\r\n  the North Carolina Court of Appeals considered a claim by a migrant worker who\r\n  was injured when he slipped and fell on a piece of soap as he walked down the\r\n  steps outside a shower at the labor camp where he resided.Â  Id. at 270.Â \r\n  The worker testified he would not have taken the job if housing had not been\r\n  provided by the employer.Â  Id.Â  The court considered the application of\r\n  the &quot;bunkhouse rule,&quot; and cited one version of the rule from\r\n  Professor Larson:\r\n\r\n  When an employee is required to live on the premises, either\r\n    by his contract of employment or by the nature of his employment, and is\r\n    continuously on call (whether or not actually on duty), the entire period of\r\n    his presence on the premises pursuant to this requirement is deemed included in\r\n    the course of employment.Â  However, if the employee has fixed hours outside of\r\n    which he is not on call, compensation is awarded usually only if the course of\r\n    the injury was a risk associated with the conditions under which claimant lived\r\n    because of the requirement of remaining on the premises.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting 1A Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen's\r\n  Compensation, Â§&nbsp;24.00, at 5-234 (1993)).[3]\r\nThe court found\r\n  that, &quot;although the nature of his employment arguably required that he\r\n  live on the premises,&quot; Jauregui was not continuously on call and at the\r\n  time of his injury was not engaged in a duty that was calculated to further,\r\n  directly or indirectly, the employer's business.Â  Id. at 271.Â  The court\r\n  noted there was no precedent in that jurisdiction for it to follow the\r\n  bunkhouse rule, in any event, and without it the employee could not prevail.Â  Id. at 271-72.\r\nInitially, we note\r\n  that, although South Carolina courts\r\n  frequently look to North Carolina's rulings since our workers' compensation\r\n  code is very similar, there is no requirement that we abide by North Carolina's\r\n  determination for our own law, particularly since it was decided by an\r\n  intermediate appellate court.Â  See Parrott v. Barfield Used Parts,\r\n  206 S.C. 381, 34 S.E.2d 802 (1945) (stating North Carolina workers'\r\n  compensation decisions, while generally persuasive, are not binding on this\r\n  Court). Â Â \r\nFurther,\r\n  we do not find Jauregui persuasive.Â  The\r\n  decision does not comport with emerging developments in workers' compensation\r\n  law, as courts have become more cognizant of the realities of the\r\n  particularized conditions under which migrant workers are employed.Â  For\r\n  example, although the North Carolina court ostensibly determined that Jauregui\r\n  was not &quot;required&quot; to live at the labor camp, presumably because he\r\n  was not contractually required to do so, this ignores the reality that\r\n  virtually all of the migrant workers lived on the employer's premises as there\r\n  was no real housing alternative, and their presence on the employer's premises\r\n  benefited not only the workers, but also the employer, since the workers could\r\n  be transported each day to begin work without delay.Â  The employer could not\r\n  have found workers if it had not provided housing since the wages earned by the\r\n  workers did not enable them to afford housing in the area.Â  Thus, the first\r\n  premise in its analysis, i.e., that Jauregui was not required to live at the\r\n  labor camp, is inaccurate.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  North Carolina court, despite its holding, acknowledged this fact when it\r\n  observed that &quot;the nature of his [Jauregui's] employment arguably\r\n    required that he live on the premises.&quot;Â  Id. at 271 (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Therefore, in rejecting the bunkhouse rule, the North Carolina court\r\n  failed to consider the full import of the definition that it quoted from\r\n  Professor Larson, i.e., that the rule applies when the employee is required to\r\n  live on the employer's premises either by the employment contract or by the nature of the work involved.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, North Carolina lacks a consistent rule in resident-employee cases,\r\n  which is illustrated by the fact that compensation was awarded in another North\r\n  Carolina decision, in which the employee was required by the nature of his work\r\n  to live at the employer's remote work site in a foreign country.Â  See Chandler\r\n    v. Nello L. Teer Co., 281 S.E.2d 718 (N.C. Ct. App. 1981) (allowing\r\n  benefits where the employee was stationed at a remote work camp for a road\r\n  building project in Africa and the accident occurred as he was traveling back\r\n  to his employer's camp after an off-duty excursion with friends; the court\r\n  found the employee was killed in an automobile accident arising out of and in\r\n  the course of his employment, even though he was returning after a personal\r\n  frolic, because he was still within the confines of the employer's road project\r\n  and was returning to his employer-provided sleeping quarters at the time of the\r\n  accident).Â  \r\nIn Chandler the\r\n  court stated that &quot;[i]t is clear that if [the employee] had been injured\r\n  while sleeping in the camp, walking to the dining hall, inspecting one of\r\n  Teer's completed roads, or participating in a Teer-organized softball game, his\r\n  injuries would be compensable.&quot;Â  Id. at 720.Â  The court held that\r\n  in such situations where the employer provided its employees with sleeping,\r\n  eating, and recreational facilities within the project area, employees are\r\n  &quot;continuously in an employment situation&quot; and are &quot;protected by\r\n  the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act&quot; while they are within the\r\n  confines of the employer's premises.Â  Id. at 721.Â  \r\nThe Chandler decision was affirmed by the North Carolina Supreme Court, which stated it had\r\n  &quot;carefully examined the Court of Appeals' opinion&quot; and found\r\n  &quot;that the result reached by the Court of Appeals, its reasoning, and the\r\n  legal principles enunciated by it to be altogether correct&quot; and that it\r\n  would &quot;adopt that opinion as [its] own.&quot;Â  Chandler v. Nello L.\r\n    Teer Co., 287 S.E.2d 890, 891 (N.C. 1982).Â  Based on this fact and the\r\n  reasonableness of the result, we find Chandler to be more persuasive\r\n  here.[4]Â  \r\nOther jurisdictions\r\n  have applied the bunkhouse rule under similar circumstances and found the\r\n  injuries arose out of and in the course of employment where the employee was required,\r\n  either by contract or by the nature of the work, to reside on the employer's\r\n  premises, such as migrant workers, logging employees, and others who live at\r\n  remote work sites.Â  In such cases, the premises are considered an extension of\r\n  the employer's primary work site.Â  For the rule to apply, the injuries must\r\n  have occurred during the employee's reasonable use of the premises and does\r\n  include activities for personal comfort.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals of Oregon analyzed the bunkhouse rule as a matter of first\r\n  impression in the case of Hernandez v. Leo Polehn Orchards, 857 P.2d 213\r\n  (Or. Ct. App. 1993).Â  In Hernandez, the claimant, a migrant worker at a\r\n  cherry orchard, sustained injuries at the employerâ€™s labor camp where she\r\n  resided when she slipped and fell in a mud puddle as she walked from the\r\n  housing area to an outdoor bathroom facility to empty her spouseâ€™s bedpan.Â  Id. at 214.\r\nThe\r\n  court remarked that there are a variety of specialized situations where the\r\n  activities of the employee have been categorized to determine if there is a\r\n  sufficient work connection to make them compensable.Â  Id. at 215.Â  One\r\n  example is the personal comfort line of cases, which provide that such\r\n  activities are compensable if they are either undertaken at work or, if the\r\n  employee was not at work, if the employee was required to reside on the\r\n  premises and was continuously on-call.Â  Id.Â  &quot;The basic\r\n  underpinning of those cases is that it is the obligation of employment to be on\r\n  the premises that creates the risk of injury to the employee; when the employee\r\n  is free to leave when he or she pleases, that employment connection does not\r\n  exist.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The bunkhouse rule represents an incremental\r\n  extension of that line of cases.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;It is the obligation\r\n  of employment to reside on the premises that subjects the employee to the risk\r\n  that resulted in injury.&quot;Â  Id. at 216.\r\nThe\r\n  court observed that although Hernandez was not contractually required to live\r\n  on the premises, there was no other practical alternative, as even the employer\r\n  had acknowledged that housing was supplied only because there was no other\r\n  place for the workers to stay.Â  Id. at 216-17.Â  The court noted:Â \r\n  &quot;Larson observes that . . . the 'better view' upholds compensability when\r\n  living on the premises is practically required.&quot; Â Id. at 217\r\n  (citing 1A Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law 5-271, Â§ 24.40 (1993)).Â \r\n  The court next found that the injury resulted from the condition of the\r\n  premises where she lived.Â  In this case, Hernandez slipped in a mud puddle that\r\n  was created by the employer's act of hosing down the outhouse areas as part of\r\n  its routine maintenance at the camp.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  another case involving migrant workers, the Supreme Court of Florida held an\r\n  accident by an employee recruited from Jamaica to work for a sugar company in\r\n  Florida was covered under workers' compensation law, applying the bunkhouse\r\n  rule.Â  Carr v. United States Sugar Corp., 136 So. 2d 638 (Fla. 1962).Â \r\n  The worker was injured when he slipped and fell on the stairs to his barracks\r\n  as he was leaving to visit a worker in another barracks.Â  Id. at 639.Â \r\n  The court stated an injury may be compensable when either the contract or the nature of the work requires the worker's presence and the worker is\r\n  making reasonable use of the employer's premises.Â  Id. at 641. \r\nThe court noted\r\n  that &quot;the employer maintained the barracks for the obvious purpose of\r\n  furthering the business of producing sugar so that the employees would be\r\n  readily available to report for work in the fields at 7&nbsp;A.M.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  The court further noted that the employee was making reasonable use of the\r\n  premises, as it must have been contemplated that the employees would be free to\r\n  visit each other &quot;rather than be confined when off duty exclusively to the\r\n  particular barracks where the employee was required to live.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court observed that migrant farm workers, by the nature of their jobs, must\r\n  travel to follow the harvesting of produce and thus they do not establish\r\n  residences, so often their housing is supplied as part of their employment;[5] additionally, their proximity to the farms benefits their employers since the\r\n  products they are dealing with are perishable and providing housing &quot;is an\r\n  assurance that the workers are readily available at any time within a short\r\n  distance from the work area.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Dupree v. Barney,\r\n  163 A.2d 901, 906-07 (Penn. 1960)).\r\nIn a\r\n  case involving a logging employee, the New Mexico Court of Appeals also\r\n  recognized the unique employment circumstances of workers who must live at\r\n  remote work sites.Â  Lujan v. Payroll Express, Inc., 837 P.2d 451 (N.M.\r\n  Ct. App. 1992), cert. denied (N.M. 1992).Â  In Lujan, the employee\r\n  died of carbon monoxide poisoning while residing in a van at a logging site\r\n  that was accessible only by rough roads.Â  Id. at 452.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court, applying the bunkhouse rule and citing the preferred view, i.e., that\r\n  &quot;even in the absence of a requirement in the employment contract,\r\n  residence should be deemed 'required' whenever there is no reasonable\r\n  alternative, in view of the distance of the work from residential facilities or\r\n  the lack of availability of accommodations elsewhere,&quot; found Lujan's death\r\n  was the result of a compensable accident arising out of and in the course of\r\n  his employment.Â  Id. at 454 (quoting 1A Arthur\r\n  Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law Â§&nbsp;24.40 at 5-270 (1990)). Â The\r\n  court stated &quot;Lujan's presence at the job site was necessary because no\r\n  other accommodations were available within a reasonable distance . . . .&quot;Â  Id. at 454.Â  The court remarked, &quot;It seems particularly\r\n  unreasonable to suggest that the worker in this case had viable alternative\r\n  sleeping arrangements&quot; where the nearest motels were thirty miles away and\r\n  would have cost Lujan almost half of his daily wages to obtain.Â  Id.\r\nWe find the\r\n  reasoning in these cases persuasive and that they represent the modern view in\r\n  employee-residence jurisprudence.Â  Applying this reasoning, we conclude in the current appeal that the Commissionâ€™s findings that\r\n  Pierre was not required to live on his employerâ€™s premises and that his\r\n  presence did not further, either directly or indirectly, the interest of his\r\n  employer are not supported by substantial evidence.Â  The president and\r\n  part-owner of Seaside Farms stated that up to 96 people are allowed to reside\r\n  in the Land's End camp, where most of the packers stayed.Â  At peak operation,\r\n  over 100 people were employed, and approximately 10 people (mostly locals who\r\n  had their own housing) were retained year-round.Â  Essentially, the crew leader\r\n  would bring enough people to fill the housing.Â  The company president testified\r\n  that he provided housing to the workers as a cost of doing business because the\r\n  workers had no other place to stay and his business could not operate if he did\r\n  not provide the housing.Â  The migrant workers did not earn enough to obtain\r\n  housing, and short-term rentals that coincided with the time they would be in\r\n  the area did not exist.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is clear from the record that Pierre was required, not by contract, but by the\r\n  nature of his employment, to live on-site near the packing facility as there\r\n  was no reasonable alternative and virtually all of the workers at Seaside Farms\r\n  lived in the housing provided by their employer.Â  The employer absorbed the\r\n  expense of housing the workers as the cost of doing business and to further its\r\n  business, as it was convenient to have all of the workers ready to begin work\r\n  at the same time, particularly those such as Pierre who were working in the\r\n  packing house, which operates on an assembly-line basis.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, we conclude the Commissionâ€™s finding that the risk was not associated\r\n  with Pierreâ€™s employment because the sidewalk was no different in character\r\n  from other sidewalks is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â \r\n  Pierreâ€™s accident occurred as a result of a hazard that existed on the\r\n  employerâ€™s premises, i.e., Pierre slipped and fell on a wet sidewalk just\r\n  outside the employeesâ€™ housing facility.Â  The sidewalk was wet because another\r\n  person was using the outside sink and the water ran down the sidewalk.Â  The\r\n  employer's placement of the sink and the apparent lack of drainage created the\r\n  wet conditions that caused Pierre to fall.Â  Thus, the source of the injury was\r\n  a risk associated with the conditions under which the employees were required\r\n  to live.Â  But for the fact that Pierreâ€™s work essentially required him to live\r\n  on his employer's premises near the farm, he would not have been exposed to the\r\n  risk that caused his injury.Â  Further, it is undisputed that Pierre was making\r\n  a reasonable use of the premises at the time of his injury.Â  Cf. Hernandez,\r\n  857 P.2d at 214 (stating the basic underpinning of cases finding compensability\r\n  is that it is the obligation to reside on the employerâ€™s premises that subjects\r\n  the employee to the risk that resulted in injury and creates the employment\r\n  connection that does not exist when the employee is free to leave).\r\nAlthough\r\n  merely being on an employerâ€™s premises, without more, does not automatically\r\n  confer compensability for an injury, we believe the circumstances of Pierreâ€™s\r\n  accidentâ€”including the facts that he was required by the nature of his work to\r\n  live on the employerâ€™s premises and such residence furthered the interests of\r\n  the employer, the injury arose from a hazard existing on the employerâ€™s\r\n  premises, and he was making reasonable use of the premisesâ€”establish the\r\n  requisite work connection and compel a finding that Pierreâ€™s injury arose out\r\n  of and in the course of his employment at Seaside Farms.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we hold Pierre's accidental injury arose out of and in the course of\r\n  his employment and is compensable under our workers' compensation law.Â  Pierre\r\n  was essentially required to live on the employer's premises by the nature of\r\n  his employment, and he was making a reasonable use of the employer-provided\r\n  premises at the time of his accident.Â  Moreover, his injury is causally related\r\n  to his employment in that it was due to the conditions under which he lived,\r\n  i.e., a wet sidewalk outside his building.Â  Consequently, the decision of the\r\n  circuit court is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings in\r\n  accordance with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The South Carolina Legislature has since changed the\r\n  review procedure for workersâ€™ compensation matters to eliminate review by the\r\n  circuit court, but the change does not affect the procedure applicable to this\r\n  case.Â  See generally S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2009) (regarding\r\n  judicial review of administrative decisions); id. Â§&nbsp;42-17-60 (concerning\r\n  appeals of Commission awards).\r\n[2]Â  Both Pierre and Seaside Farms acknowledge that South\r\n  Carolina has not had occasion to consider the application of the &quot;bunkhouse\r\n  rule&quot; per se, although we have had cases where an employee has been\r\n  injured while residing on the employer's premises or going to the employer's\r\n  work camp.Â  See, e.g., Sola v. Sunny Slope Farms, 244 S.C. 6, 135\r\n  S.E.2d 321 (1964) (holding an employee's death while traveling from a packing\r\n  shed to a labor camp where he resided and performed additional duties arose out\r\n  of and in the course of his employment); Jolly v. S.C. Indus. Sch. for Boys,\r\n  219 S.C. 155, 64 S.E. 252 (1951) (holding an employee's injury that occurred\r\n  while he was off-duty and painting the hallway in the apartment supplied by his\r\n  employer rent-free arose out of and in the course of his employment as a hog\r\n  foreman and general utility worker at an industrial school).Â  \r\n[3]Â  Identical language on this general rule applied to resident\r\n  employees now appears in 2&nbsp;Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's\r\n    Workers' Compensation Law, Scope &amp; Â§&nbsp;24.01 (2009).\r\n[4]Â  Cf. Ramsey v. S. Indus. Constructors, Inc.,\r\n  630 S.E.2d 681, 685-86 (N.C. Ct.
