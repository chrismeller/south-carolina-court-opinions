Pachak, of\r\n          the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of\r\n          Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n          \r\n\r\n          \r\n  \r\n        \r\n        Attorney General Charles M.

We vacate and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nOn February 17, 1983, petitioner pled guilty to armed robbery\r\nwhich was committed on May 27,1982. Petitioner filed an application for PCR\r\non September 9, 1996. Subsequent to filing the PCR action, he amended his\r\nPCR application to add an ex post facto claim due to a change from annual\r\nreview for parole to biannual review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe PCR court summarily dismissed the PCR action based upon the\r\nstatute of limitations, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (Supp. 1998), and Peloquin\r\nv. State, 321 S.C. 468, 469 S.E.2d 606 (1996) (holding that all defendants\r\nconvicted prior to the effective date of the statute, July 1,1995, must be allowed\r\nuntil July 1, 1996, to file an application). Petitioner filed a motion to alter or\r\namend the judgment of the PCR court. At the hearing on the motion, petitioner\r\ntestified that he filed his amendment to the PCR application within one year of\r\ndiscovering that his parole review had changed to biannual review. The PCR\r\ncourt denied the motion to alter or amend the judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nWe granted the petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether\r\na change from annual parole review to biannual review for violent offenders violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  I.  Did the PCR court err in summarily dismissing petitioner's\r\n    claim?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  II.  Does the change from annual parole review to biannual\r\n    review violate the Ex Post Facto Clause?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nI. Summary Dismissal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nBecause petitioner filed his ex post facto claim within one year of\r\ndiscovering that his parole review had changed to biannual review, he argues\r\nthat the PCR court erred in summarily dismissing his PCR action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nDue to our recent decision in Al-Shabazz v. State, Op. No. 24995\r\n(S.C. Sup. Ct. refiled Feb. 14, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 21), whether\r\nsummary dismissal was proper is no longer an issue. Pursuant to Al-Shabazz,\r\nan ex post facto claim is not appropriate for PCR. The Al-Shabazz Court held\r\nthat \"PCR is a proper avenue of relief only when the applicant mounts a\r\ncollateral attack challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence as\r\nauthorized by Section 17-27-20(a).\" Id. at 28 (emphasis in original).1  Since\r\npetitioner's ex post facto claim is not a collateral attack on the validity of his\r\nconviction or sentence, it is not cognizable under the PCR statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nInstead, an ex post facto claim is considered a non-collateral matter.\r\nWe held in Al-Shabazz that if an inmate raises a non-collateral matter with the\r\nDepartment of Corrections (DOC), then the state Administrative Procedures Act\r\n(APA) applies and an inmate may seek review of the DOC's final decision under\r\nthe APA. Id. at 34-35. The Al-Shabazz decision applies to all pending PCR\r\nactions in which the DOC has decided a non-collateral matter and the inmate\r\nhas not had the opportunity to obtain APA review. Id. at 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nAccordingly, as a non-collateral matter, petitioner's ex post facto\r\nclaim should be remanded to the appropriate agency to allow it to make a final\r\ndecision on petitioner's claim. However, it is unclear from the record whether\r\nthe DOC made the decision to retroactively apply the law changing parole\r\nreview to every two years, or whether the Department of Probation, Pardon and\r\nParole Services (DPPPS) is the agency responsible for this decision. We\r\ntherefore remand this matter to the circuit court to determine whether the case\r\nshould be remanded to the DOC or the DPPPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nII. Ex Post Facto Claim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nPetitioner argues that the change in his parole review from annual\r\nto biannual review constitutes an ex post facto violation.2 We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nPetitioner committed armed robbery in 1982.3 At that time, parole\r\nreview commenced after an inmate served one-fourth of his sentence, and if\r\nparole was denied, the inmate's case would then be reviewed \"every twelve\r\nmonths thereafter.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-620 (Supp. 1981). In 1986, the\r\nLegislature enacted the Omnibus Crime Act. One section of the legislation\r\ndefined violent crimes, and armed robbery is specifically enumerated as a\r\nviolent crime. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (Supp. 1998). After an initial\r\ndenial of parole, those convicted of violent crimes will be reconsidered for parole\r\n\"every two years.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-645 (Supp. 1998). \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nAn ex post facto violation occurs when a change in the law\r\nretroactively alters the definition of a crime or increases the punishment for a\r\ncrime. E.g., Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63\r\n(1997); California Dep't of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499,115 S.Ct.1597,\r\n131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995); Farris v. State, 334 S.C. 21, 511 S.E.2d 688 (1999).\r\nRegarding the issue of increase of punishment, the relevant inquiry is whether\r\nthe legislative amendment \"produces a sufficient risk of increasing the measure\r\nof punishment attached to the covered crimes.\" Morales, 514 U.S. at 509, 115\r\nS.Ct. at 1603, 131 L.Ed.2d at 597. If the amendment produces only a\r\n\"speculative and attenuated possibility\" of increasing an inmate's punishment,\r\nthen there is no ex post facto violation. Id. A court should look at the effect of\r\nthe statute on the \"quantum of punishment\" to determine whether an\r\namendment offends the Ex Post Facto Clause. Lynce, 519 U.S. at ___,117 S.Ct.\r\nat 897, 137 L.Ed.2d at 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe retroactive application of section 24-21-645, which results in a\r\nchange from annual to biannual parole reconsideration for violent offenders, has been challenged several times, and both this Court and the federal courts\r\nhave addressed the claim in published opinions. In Gunter v. State, 298 S.C.\r\n113, 378 S.E.2d 443 (1989), the petitioner argued that the change to biannual\r\nparole review violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and\r\nSouth Carolina Constitutions. This Court stated that \"the standards governing\r\npetitioner's parole eligibility have not been changed. Instead, only the\r\nfrequency with which petitioner can be reconsidered for parole has been\r\naltered.\" Id. at 115-16, 378 S.E.2d at 444. Thus, the Court held that there was\r\nno ex post facto violation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHowever, in Griffin v. State, 315 S.C. 285, 433 S.E.2d 862 (1993),\r\ncert. denied, 510 U.S.1093,114 S.Ct. 924,127 L.Ed.2d 217 (1994), we overruled\r\nthis holding of Gunter. The Griffin court adopted the decision of the Fourth\r\nCircuit Court of Appeals in Roller v. Cavanaugh, 984 F.2d 120 (4th Cir. 1993)\r\n(Roller I). In Roller I, the Fourth Circuit stated that it was \"not willing to\r\ndisparage the `substance' of a year, especially a year in prison,\" and found that\r\nthe change to biannual review was not merely procedural. Id. at 123. The\r\nRoller I court held that the change from annual parole review to biannual\r\nreview offended ex post facto principles. Finding the Fourth Circuit's analysis\r\ncompelling, this Court in Griffin adopted the holding of Roller I.\r\nIn 1995, the United States Supreme Court decided California Dep't\r\n  of Corrections v. Morales. The Morales Court evaluated an amended California\r\nstatute directed at inmates who had been convicted of \"more than one offense\r\nwhich involves the taking of a life.\" Under the law in effect at the time of\r\nMorales' second murder, he was eligible for parole hearings on an annual basis.\r\nThe amended statute, directed specifically at those who had killed more than\r\nonce, gave the parole board the discretion to defer parole review for up to three\r\nyears if the board found that is was not reasonable to expect that the inmate\r\nwould be granted parole during the interval. The statute directed the board to\r\nstate the bases for its finding that parole review should be deferred. Morales,\r\n514 U.S. at 503, 115 S.Ct. at 1600, 131 L.Ed.2d at 593.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Morales Court stated that the amendment created \"only the\r\nmost speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect\r\nof increasing the measure of punishment for covered crimes, and such\r\nconjectural effects are insufficient under any threshold\" which might be\r\nestablished under the Ex Post Facto Clause. Id. at 509, 115 S.Ct. at 1603, 131\r\nL.Ed.2d at 597. In deciding that there was an insufficient risk of increasing\r\npunishment under the amended statute, the Court focused on several aspects\r\nof the statute. First, the law applied \"only to a class of prisoners for whom the\r\nlikelihood of release on parole is quite remote.\" Id. at 510, 115 S.Ct. at 1603,\r\n131 L.Ed.2d at 597. Second, the parole board's authority under the statute was\r\ncarefully tailored in that the board was required to find it was not reasonably\r\nexpected that the inmate would be granted parole at a hearing in the following\r\nyears. The Morales Court noted that this was \"`no arbitrary decision\"' because\r\nthe board would first have to conduct a complete hearing and, if it chose to defer\r\nthe next parole review for more than a year, it had to state the bases of that\r\nfinding. Id. at 511, 115 S.Ct. at 1604, 131 L.Ed.2d at 598 (citation omitted).\r\nFinally, the Court stated that the board retained the authority \"to tailor the\r\nfrequency of subsequent suitability hearings to the particular circumstances of\r\nthe individual prisoner.\" Id. In sum, the Morales Court concluded that the\r\nstatute \"simply allow[ed] the Board to avoid the futility of going through the\r\nmotions of reannouncing its denial of parole suitability on a yearly basis\" for\r\nthis subset of inmates. Id. at 512, 115 S.Ct. at 1604, 131 L.Ed.2d at 598.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Fourth Circuit revisited the issue of whether South Carolina's\r\nchange from annual to biannual parole review constituted an ex post facto\r\nviolation in Roller v. Gunn, 107 F.3d 227 (4f Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 874,\r\n118 S.Ct. 192, 139 L.Ed.2d 130 (1997) (Roller II). In Roller II, the Fourth\r\nCircuit held that, in light of the Morales decision, the application of section 24\r\n21-645 did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The Roller II court found that\r\nthe South Carolina statute prescribing biannual parole review for violent\r\noffenders \"bears a strong resemblance to the California statute sustained in\r\nMorales.\" Id. at 235. The Fourth Circuit stated that \"[l]ike the California\r\nmeasure, the South Carolina law applies only to prisoners convicted of violent\r\ncrimes-prisoners which the South Carolina legislature determined were\r\nunlikely to receive release on parole.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nJudge Hall dissented in Roller II and disagreed with the majority's\r\nconclusion that the South Carolina statute resembles the California statute in\r\nMorales. Judge Hall noted that while the California statute applies only to\r\nthose convicted of more than one killing, i.e., \"the worst of the worst,\" the South\r\nCarolina statute applies to all violent offenders, some of whom are incarcerated\r\nfor crimes which carry a one- to ten-year sentence. Id. at 238 (citing S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(1)(a) which prescribes a sentence of one to ten years for a\r\nfirst offense of trafficking in 10-100 pounds marijuana). Judge Hall also noted\r\nthat the California statute had a default review of one year, with a deferral of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nup to three years available only upon a finding that the inmate will likely not\r\nbe paroled before then, while the South Carolina statute simply sets parole\r\nreview for violent offenders automatically at every two years. Id. at 239.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nWe find the analysis of the dissent in Roller II more compelling than\r\nthat of the Roller II majority. The South Carolina statute which calls for\r\nbiannual parole review hearings for all violent offenders is clearly\r\ndistinguishable from the very specific statute at issue in Morales. Under South\r\nCarolina law, there is a variety of crimes defined as violent,4 and the possible\r\nsentences for these crimes range from one year to life imprisonment. In\r\nMorales, the statute applied to a very well-defined set of inmates - multiple\r\nkillers - while the South Carolina statute applies equally to a variety of inmates\r\n- from murderers to marijuana traffickers - and many of these inmates will\r\nlikely be paroled at some point. Moreover, the South Carolina statute does not\r\nrequire any specific findings in order to defer parole review for two years;\r\ninstead, the two-year interval is automatic after an initial denial of parole.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nApplying the test for an ex post facto violation, we hold that the\r\nchange from annual parole eligibility review to biannual review \"produces a\r\nsufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered\r\ncrimes,\" and therefore, any retroactive application of section 24-21-645\r\nconstitutes an ex post facto violation. Morales, 514 U.S. at 509, 115 S.Ct. at\r\n1603, 131 L.Ed.2d at 597; see also Lynce, 519 U.S. at ___, 117 S.Ct. at 897, 137\r\nL.Ed.2d at 73 (if a statute effectively increases the \"quantum of punishment,\"\r\nthen retroactive application is unconstitutional).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nAccordingly, this Court's holding in Griffin v. State, supra, that\r\nretroactive application of the statute increasing parole review to every two\r\nyears constitutes an ex post facto violation, remains the law in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe hold that the retroactive application of section 24-21-645\r\nviolates petitioner's ex post facto rights. Pursuant to Al-Shabazz v. State,\r\nsupra, we vacate the PCR court's decision and remand to the circuit court to\r\ndetermine which agency - either the DOC or the DPPPS - this matter should\r\nbe remanded to for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nVACATED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nTOAL, A.C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur. FINNEY,\r\nC.J., not participating.\r\n1 The Court noted that the two non-collateral matters specifically enumerated in section 17-27-20(a)(5) were exceptions to this general rule. See S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-20(a)(5) (Supp. 1998) (PCR claims are allowed where applicant alleges that his sentence has expired or his probation, parole or conditional release has been unlawfully revoked). Neither of these exceptions, however, applies to petitioner's ex post facto claim. \r\n2The Constitutions of the United States and of South Carolina specificallyprohibit the passage of ex post facto laws. U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10; S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 4.  \r\n3 The law existing at the time of the offense determines whether an increase of punishment constitutes an ex post facto violation. Elmore v. State, 305 S. C. 456, 459, 409 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1991) (citing Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 96 L.Ed.2d 351(1987)).\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n4 Currently, the violent crime statute defines the following crimes as violent: murder; criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the first and second degree; CSC with minors, first and second degree; assault with intent to commit CSC, first and second degree; assault and battery with intent to kill; kidnapping; voluntary manslaughter; armed robbery; attempted armed robbery; carjacking; drug trafficking; arson in the first degree and second degree; burglary in the first degree and second degree; engaging a child for a sexual performance; homicide by child abuse; aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse; accessory before the fact to commit any of the above offenses; and attempt to commit any of the above offenses. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1-60 (Supp. 1998).  \r\n5 Recently, in Garner v. Jones, 2000 WL 309135 (filed March 28, 2000), the United States Supreme Court addressed Georgia's parole review provisions. Under Georgia law, the Parole Board is initially required to consider parole for inmates serving life sentences after they have served seven years. Ga. Code. Ann. &sect; 42-9-45(B)(1982). The Parole Board's Rules required that reconsideration of the denial of parole take place every three years. In 1985, the Board amended its rules to provide that \"reconsideration of those inmates serving life sentences who have been denied parole shall take place at least every eight years.\" Ga. Rules &amp; Regs., Rule 475-3-.05(2) (1985)(emphasis supplied). In 1995, Jones, who was serving two life sentences for two murders, was denied parole. The Parole Board set his next consideration for 2003. Although the board could have shortened the interval, it set the 8-year period based on Jones' multiple offenses and the \"circumstances and nature\" of his second offense. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals found the change in review from 3 years to 8 years to constitute an ex post facto violation. Jones v. Garner, 164 F.3d 589 (11th Cir. 1999). The U.S. Supreme Court reversed. Garner v. Jones, 2000 WL 309135 (filed March 28, 2000). \r\nIn Garner, the Court found the amended rule did not create a significant risk of prolonging respondent's incarceration because a) the rule vests the Board with discretion as to how often to set an inmate's date for reconsideration, with 8 years being the maximum, and b) the Board's policies permit \"expedited parole reviews in the event of a change in their circumstance or where the Board receives new information that would warrant a sooner review.\" Given these factors, the Garner Court found the Board could set reconsideration dates according to the likelihood a review would result in meaningful considerations as to an inmate's suitability for release. Moreover, inmates whom the Board did not feel would likely be suitable for release could nonetheless seek an earlier review upon a showing of either \"a change in [his] circumstances [s]\" or the Board's receipt of \"new information.\" \r\nUnlike the Georgia Parole Board's Rules, South Carolina's statute automatically increases violent offenders parole consideration from one year to \"every two years.\" S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-21-645. There is nothing in the statute providing for an earlier discretionary review if an inmate appears suitable for review, nor is there any provision permitting an earlier review upon a showing of changed circumstances. Unlike Garner, we find South Carolina's system does indeed create \"a significant risk of prolonging respondent's incarceration,\" by one year without any chance for review in the interim. Accordingly, the Supreme Court's opinion in Garner is inapposite. \r\nIn any event, more expansive rights may be afforded under state constitutional provisions than those conferred by the federal constitution.

A jury found him guilty but mentally ill on both charges. He was sentenced to life in prison for murder and twenty years for\r\n ABIK. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia\r\nin 1984. Appellant's illness led to the loss of his job as an accountant, a divorce,\r\nand his decision to move from Columbia back to Chester County to live with his\r\nelderly mother. Appellant joined the Chester Civitan Club and was appointed\r\nto oversee its \"candy box\" program. He was responsible for collecting money\r\nfrom boxes left in stores, replenishing the candy, and making deposits. He took\r\nthe job very seriously and usually performed it well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fall 1996, William R. Thrailkill, the owner of a home remodeling\r\nbusiness and a Civitan Club member also involved in the candy box program,\r\nand appellant had a dispute about an empty candy box at a local store. The\r\nargument angered and upset appellant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a Civitan Club meeting, at a restaurant about two weeks later,\r\nneither appellant nor Thrailkill initially appeared upset. Appellant approached\r\nThrailkill to discuss the candy box mater again as Thrailkill, his son, and other\r\nmembers formed a line at the buffet. Thrailkill refused to discuss it and made\r\na disparaging remark that angered appellant. Appellant immediately left the\r\nroom and retrieved a .38-caliber revolver from his car. Appellant strode back\r\ninto the restaurant, declaring he was \"going to kill that son of a bitch.\" He\r\nemptied his gun at Thrailkill, striking him with five shots. Thrailkill died at a\r\nhospital two months later from complications caused by his injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA stray bullet struck Elihue Armstrong, a semi-retired grocer and\r\nbarber who was standing nearby, in, the right arm and chest. Armstrong\r\nsurvived the injuries. Appellant told a psychiatrist that he did not intend to\r\ninjure Armstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant moved for a directed verdict on the ABIK charge.\r\nAppellant asserted that the State had failed to prove he intended to kill\r\nArmstrong, and the doctrine of transferred intent did not apply. The judge\r\ndenied the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the trial judge err in refusing to direct a verdict on\r\nthe ABIK charge because the doctrine of transferred\r\nintent is inapplicable when the intended victim is\r\nkilled and a stray bullet injures - but does not kill - an\r\nunintended victim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn considering a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is\r\nconcerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not with its weight.\r\nThe case should be submitted to the jury if there is any direct evidence or\r\nsubstantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt\r\nof the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly or logically deduced. State\r\nv. Robinson, 310 S.C. 535, 426 S.E.2d'317 (1992). In reviewing the denial of a\r\nmotion for a directed verdict, the evidence must be viewed in the light most\r\nfavorable to the State. If there is any direct evidence or substantial\r\ncircumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\nthe appellate court must find that the case was properly submitted to the jury.\r\nState v. Venters, 300 S.C. 260, 387 S.E.2d 270 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the. trial judge erred in refusing to direct a\r\nverdict in his favor on the ABIK charge. The doctrine of transferred intent does\r\nnot apply because any intent was \"fully satisfied\" by the death of Thrailkill (the\r\nintended victim); therefore, nothing was left to transfer to Armstrong (the\r\nunintended victim). Furthermore, appellant argues, the doctrine is inapplicable\r\nbecause the harm appellant intended to inflict on Thrailkill (death) was not\r\nidentical to the harm inflicted on Armstrong (injury). We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCriminal liability normally is based upon the concurrence of two\r\nfactors: the defendant's criminal intent and the actual, physical act constituting\r\nthe offense. United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 402, 100 S.Ct. 624, 630-31,\r\n62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980) (cited in McAninch &amp; Fairey, The Criminal Law of South\r\nCarolina 1 (1996)). A defendant may not be convicted of a criminal offense\r\nunless the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted with the\r\ncriminal intent, or mental state, required for a particular offense. State v.\r\nFerguson, 302 S.C. 269, 271, 395 S.E:2d 182, 183 (1990) (required mental state\r\nfor particular crime may be purpose (intent), knowledge, recklessness, or\r\ncriminal negligence).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant's first argument is easily resolved. Some have observed,\r\nas the prosecutor did at appellant's trial, that \"malice follows the bullet.\" Such\r\nexplanations, as well as the term \"transferred intent\" itself, are somewhat\r\nmisleading. The defendant's mental state, or mens rea, whatever it may be at\r\nthe time he allegedly commits a criminal act, is contained within the\r\ndefendant's brain when he commits the act. That mental state never leaves the\r\ndefendant's brain; it is not \"transferred\" from the defendant's brain to another\r\nperson or place. A more apt description might be that the mental state is like\r\na spotlight emanating from its source - the defendant's mind - to its target - the\r\nintended victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNor is that mental state in limited supply. The mental state\r\n\"spotlight\" is not extinguished at the moment a bullet strikes and kills the\r\nintended victim, such that there is no mental state left upon which to convict\r\nan unintended victim who also is injured or killed. See People v. Scott, 927 P.2d\r\n288, 292 (Cal. 1996) (\"[c]ontrary to what its name implies, the transferred\r\nintent doctrine does not refer to any actual intent that is capable of being 'used\r\nup' once it is employed to convict a defendant of a specific intent crime against\r\nthe intended victim\"); State v. Hinton, 630 A.2d 593, 597-98 (Conn. 1993)\r\n(rejecting argument that intent to kill may not be transferred to unintended\r\nvictim when intended victim is killed); Harvey v. State, 681 A.2d 628, 637 (Md.\r\nCt. Spec. App. 1996) (explaining that the mens rea is an elastic thing of\r\nunlimited supply which neither follows nor fails to follow the bullet, but never\r\nleaves the defendant's brain).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more difficult question is the one presented by the facts of this\r\ncase and appellant's second argument. Is it appropriate to use the doctrine of\r\ntransferred intent - admittedly a legal fiction - to transfer appellant's alleged\r\nmental state with regard to Thrailkill, the intended victim who was killed, to\r\nArmstrong, the unintended victim who was injured but not killed? To pursue\r\nour analogy, the jury ordinarily may not unilaterally shift the defendant's\r\nmental state \"spotlight\" from one person to another. The jury simply must\r\ndetermine whether that spotlight existed, i.e., was it \"on\" or \"off.\" The question\r\nin this case is whether it is appropriate to allow the jury to place its collective\r\nhand upon the \"spotlight\" of appellant's mental state and adjust the imaginary\r\nbeam so that it encompasses not only Thrailkill, but also Armstrong in order to\r\nconvict appellant of ABIK. Answering that question requires consideration of\r\ntransferred intent cases decided by this Court and the role of the doctrine in our\r\ncriminal law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court in several cases has held that a defendant may be found\r\nguilty of murder or manslaughter in a case of bad or mistaken aim under the\r\ndoctrine of transferred intent. In the classic case, the defendant intends to kill\r\nor seriously injure one person, but misses that person and mistakenly kills\r\nanother. Although the defendant did not act with malice toward the\r\nunintended victim, the defendant's criminal intent to kill the intended victim\r\n(i.e., his mental state of malice) is transferred to the unintended victim. \"If\r\nthere was malice in [defendant's] heart, he was guilty of the crime charged, it\r\nmatters not whether he killed his intended victim or a third person through\r\nmistake.\" State v. Heyward, 197 S.C. 371, 377, 15 S.E.2d 669, 672 (1941)\r\n(affirming murder conviction where defendant testified he mistakenly shot and\r\nkilled police officer who allegedly broke open his front door, believing the officer\r\nto be an assassin sent by an angry former employer). See also State v. Gandy,\r\n283 S.C. 571, 324 S.E.2d 65 (1984) (affirming murder conviction where\r\ndefendant intending to kill one man shot through a closed door, killing\r\nunintended victim instead), overruled on other grounds by State v. Lowry, 315\r\nS.C. 396, 434 S.E.2d 272 (1993); State v. Horne, 282 S.C. 444, 447, 319 S.E.2d\r\n703, 704 (1984) (holding that State in future may prosecute defendant for\r\nmurder of viable fetus when defendant attacks a pregnant woman with malice\r\nand in the process kills the fetus, an unintended victim); State v. Williams, 189\r\nS.C. 19, 24, 199 S.E. 906, 908 (1938) (affirming murder conviction where\r\ndefendant shot at intended victim who was driving a wagon of cotton, but\r\nmissed him and mistakenly killed the man sitting beside him); LaFave &amp; Scott,\r\nSubstantive Criminal Law, Â§ 3.12(d) (1986) (discussing transferred intent);\r\nMcAninch &amp; Fairey, at 17-19 (same).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unintended victim in the cases cited above was killed by the\r\ndefendant. The Court has not decided a case such as the present one in which\r\nthe intended victim was killed and the unintended victim was injured, but not\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome courts decline to resort to the doctrine of transferred intent\r\nwhen they are convinced this legal fiction is not needed to hold the defendant\r\ncriminally liable for his acts. See State v. Brady, 745 So.2d 954 (Fla. 1999)\r\n(declining to apply transferred intent doctrine where bullet fired by defendant\r\nmissed intended victim and injured unintended victim; jury properly convicted\r\ndefendant on two counts of attempted second-degree murder, which does not\r\nrequire proof of specific intent to kill); People v. Birreuta, 208 Cal. Rptr. 635\r\n(Cal. Ct. App. 1984) (declining to apply transferred intent doctrine when\r\ndefendant intentionally kills one victim and accidentally kills another victim;\r\nin such cases defendant may be prosecuted for first and second degree murder,\r\nrespectively), overruled on other grounds by People v. Flood, 957 P.2d 869 (Cal.\r\n1998); Harvey v. State, 628 A.2d at 1644 (holding that transferred intent is\r\napplicable only when the unintended victim is killed, not when the unintended\r\nvictim is injured).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Harvey court found\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n  no unsolvable problems [under Maryland law] in\r\n  punishing the unintended battery of a chance or\r\n  unintended victim. The common law penalty for\r\n  common law battery is, after all, unlimited and the\r\n  defendant may receive any appropriate sentence\r\n  without the necessity of transferring some subtle mens\r\n  rea from the intended target to the unintended target .\r\n  . . . When the injury inflicted on the unintended victim,\r\n  moreover, is at the non-fatal level of a battery, one does\r\n  not need a transferred intent doctrine to establish basic\r\n  criminal responsibility.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHarvey, 681 A.2d at 642. Similarly, the Birreuta court, in a case in which both\r\nthe intended and unintended victims were killed, found the transferred intent\r\ndoctrine unnecessary because the defendant could be prosecuted for different\r\ndegrees of murder under California law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude that our criminal laws, unlike. those of some other\r\njurisdictions, make it necessary to impose the doctrine of transferred intent in\r\nthis case. South Carolina recognizes three levels of assault: the offense of\r\nsimple assault and battery,1 the offense of assault and battery of a high and\r\naggravated nature (ABHAN), and the offense of ABIK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABHAN is a common law misdemeanor punishable by up to ten\r\nyears in prison. State v. Hill, 254 S.C. 321, 331, 175 S.E.2d 227, 232 (1970);\r\nState v. Prince, 240 S.C. 96, 100, 124 S.E.2d 778, 780 (1962). ABHAN is the\r\nunlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of\r\naggravation. State v. Frazier, 302 S:C. 500, 397 S.E.2d 93 (1990); State v.\r\nFoxworth, 269 S.C. 496, 238 S.E.2d 17,2 (1977). Circumstances of aggravation\r\ninclude the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a felony, infliction of\r\nserious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the\r\nparties, a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace,\r\ntaking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, and resistance to lawful\r\nauthority. Foxworth, 269 S.C. at 498, 238 S.E.2d at 173; State v. Hollman, 245\r\nS.C. 362, 140 S.E.2d 597 (1965); State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 21, 518 S.E.2d\r\n278, 285 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not explicitly identified any particular mental state the\r\nState must prove in order for a defendant to be found guilty of ABHAN. The\r\nState does not, however, have to prove the defendant acted with malice to\r\nobtain an ABHAN conviction because the circumstances that give rise to\r\nABHAN may also give rise to an inference of malice. Thus, a defendant may be\r\nconvicted of ABHAN regardless of whether malice is present. State v. Pilgrim,\r\n320 S.C. 409, 465 S.E.2d 108 (Ct. App. 1995) (discouraging practice of\r\ncomparing ABHAN to manslaughter injury charge because, when malice is the\r\nkey issue, it is confusing to jurors and prejudicial to defendant to import the\r\nheat of passion and sufficient legal provocation elements of voluntary\r\nmanslaughter into ABHAN charge), aff'd as modified in State v. Pilgrim, 326\r\nS.C. 24, 482 S.E.2d 562 (1997), overruled on other grounds by State v. Foust,\r\n325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrast, ABIK is a felony punishable by up to twenty years in\r\nprison. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-620 (1985). The required mental state for ABIK,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike murder, is malice aforethought. State v. Foust, supra (holding that State\r\nmust show a general intent that defendant acted with malice to obtain ABIK\r\nconviction, and overruling cases indicating that defendant had to possess\r\nspecific intent to kill to be guilty of ABIK); State v. Hinson, 253 S.C. 607, 611,\r\n172 S.E.2d 548, 550 (1970) (defining assault and battery with intent to kill as\r\n\"an unlawful act of violent nature to the person of another with malice\r\naforethought, either express or implied\"); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (1985)\r\n(defining murder as \"the killing of any person with malice aforethought, either\r\nexpress or implied\").2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe record shows appellant did not act with malice toward\r\nArmstrong, the unintended victim. Appellant was angry at Thrailkill, the\r\nintended victim, and he killed him. A stray bullet happened to strike\r\nArmstrong. Consequently, the only way the State could show that appellant\r\nallegedly acted with malice with regard to Armstrong, thereby possibly\r\nobtaining an ABIK conviction and subjecting him to a twenty-year sentence, is\r\nthrough the doctrine of transferred intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant conceivably could be held liable for ABHAN, regardless\r\nof whether he acted with malice. The maximum penalty for ABHAN, however,\r\nis ten years. State v. Hill, supra (interpreting predecessor statute of S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 17-25-20 (1985) to mean maximum punishment is ten years when\r\nstatute does not establish the penalty). We conclude it would not be\r\nappropriate to limit the penalty and punishment to that provided for ABHAN\r\nunder these circumstances. A person who, acting with malice, unleashes a\r\ndeadly force in an attempt to kill or injure an intended victim should anticipate\r\nthat the law will require him to answer fully for his deeds when that force kills\r\nor injures an unintended victim. Accordingly, we hold that the doctrine of\r\ntransferred intent may be used to convict a defendant of ABIK when the\r\ndefendant kills the intended victim and also injures an unintended victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur holding is consistent with the approach taken by other\r\njurisdictions. \"When a defendant contemplates or designs the death of another,\r\nthe purpose of deterrence is better served by holding that defendant responsible\r\nfor the knowing or purposeful murder of the unintended as well as the intended\r\nvictim.\" State v. Worlock, 569 A.2d 1314, 1325 (N.J. 1990) (affirming murder\r\nconvictions where defendant shot and killed both intended and unintended\r\nvictims); see also Hinton, 630 A.2d at 596-99 (rejecting Birreuta, supra, and\r\nupholding use of transferred intent where defendant fired into a group, killing\r\nthree men and seriously injuring a fourth); Ochoa v. State, 981 P.2d 1201,1205\r\n(Nev. 1999) (rejecting Birreuta, supra, and applying transferred intent to all\r\ncrimes where an unintended victim is harmed as a result of defendant's specific\r\nintent to harm an intended victim regardless of whether the intended victim is\r\ninjured; thus, it was appropriate to charge defendant who killed the intended\r\nvictim and injured a bystander with a stray bullet with murder and attempted\r\nmurder).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe take this opportunity to clarify our decision in State v. Bryant,\r\n316 S.C. 216, 218, 447 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1994). In that case, the defendant\r\nslammed a police officer against his patrol car during a struggle while resisting\r\narrest, damaging the car. The defendant was convicted of malicious damage to\r\npersonal property. We affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling that it was\r\nimproper to submit the offense of malicious damage to personal property to the\r\njury because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [t]he only reasonable inference from the evidence is\r\n    that the damage to the patrol car was an unintended\r\n    harm. The doctrine of transferred intent applies only\r\n    in the situation of the same intended harm inflicted on\r\n    an unintended victim . . . . The intent to assault and\r\n    batter the police officer cannot be transferred to the\r\n    property damage since the harm caused was different\r\n    from the type of harm intended.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 219, 447 S.E.2d at 854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBryant may be read to say the doctrine of transferred intent is\r\ninapplicable when the harm caused (injury to property) is different from the\r\ntype of harm intended (injury to a person). Thus, the case at hand is\r\ndistinguishable from Bryant because appellant intended to harm one person\r\nand in the process harmed another person. On the other hand, Bryant could be\r\nread to say that intent is not transferable when the harm caused (injuring a\r\nperson) is different from the type of harm intended (killing a person). Under\r\nthat interpretation, appellant's intent would not be transferable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the former interpretation more appropriate than the latter,\r\nand so we distinguish appellant's case from Bryant. A coincidental damaging\r\nof property while intending to harm a person simply presents a different\r\nsituation than harming one person while intending to harm another person.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold that the doctrine of transferred intent may be used to\r\nconvict a defendant of ABIK when the defendant kills the intended victim and\r\nalso injures an unintended victim. We affirm appellant's ABIK conviction and\r\nthe twenty-year sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice\r\nEdward B.

Hitchcock (\"Hitchcock\") appeals the Court of Appeals' decision to adopt a breach of an express warranty to obtain a specific result as a new common law cause of action against attorneys in South Carolina. We reverse the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1991, George Hart and Ann Law, who are both citizens of the United Kingdom domiciled in Scotland, consulted with the law firm Brock &amp; Hitchcock about pursuing a business opportunity involving the distribution of imported beer and related products in Charleston, South Carolina. Attorneys R.L. Hitchcock and A. Christopher Potts incorporated the business as Holy Loch Distributors, Inc. (\"Holy Loch\") in South Carolina and helped obtain the appropriate visas and immigration documents so that Holy Loch could conduct business legally in the United States. Hitchcock and Potts secured the necessary permits and licenses to distribute imported beer under South Carolina law, but failed to obtain or discover the need for the appropriate permits and licenses required by federal law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 1993, agents of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"ATF\") notified Holy Loch that they were operating in violation of federal law and were charged with: (1) distributing alcohol without a permit; (2) distributing alcohol without paying the applicable special taxes; and (3) engaging in everyday business activities in violation of immigration laws. Holy Loch paid the fines and taxes and applied to the ATF for the appropriate federal permits or licenses. Hitchcock repeatedly told Holy Loch \"not to worry\" and assured them that they would be able to obtain the permits and remain in business. Even after the ATF denied Holy Loch's application, Hitchcock continued to assure Holy Loch that they would be able to obtain the documentation needed to remain in business. In reliance on their representation, Holy Loch remained in business, paid the outstanding taxes and fines, and made application for the appropriate permits and licenses with the ATF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 8, 1995, the administrative law judge upheld the denial of the permits. At the hearing, Attorney Potts testified that neither he nor Hitchcock knew a federal license or permit was required for Holy Loch to conduct business in South Carolina. Holy Loch ceased operation of its business after the administrative hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 1997, Holy Loch, George Hart, and Ann Law brought this action against attorneys Hitchcock and Potts individually, and against the Brock &amp; Hitchcock law firm. They subsequently filed two amended complaints alleging: (1) professional negligence; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) breach of contract; and (4) breach of warranty. Hitchcock moved for dismissal of the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Hitchcock argued the three year statute of limitations on the causes of actions began to run on November 9, 1993, when Holy Loch knew they were in violation of federal alcohol and immigration laws, and had expired prior to the filing of the Complaint. Holy Loch opposed the motion arguing: (1) Hitchcock was estoppped from asserting the statute of limitations as a bar to the complaint because of their repeated assurances that they would be able to obtain the necessary permits and licenses; and (2) since Holy Loch asserted a novel cause of action, breach of warranty in a legal malpractice action, dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was inappropriate. The trial judge granted the motion on the ground the statute of limitations had expired as to all causes of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHoly Loch appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that a defendant may be estopped from asserting statute of limitations as a defense if the delay that otherwise would give operation to the statute has been induced by the defendant's conduct, including an express representation that the claim will be settled without litigation or conduct that suggests a law suit is not necessary. Holy Loch Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 332 S.C. 247, 503 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1998). Additionally, the Court of Appeals recognized a breach of an express warranty to obtain a specific result as a new common law cause of action against attorneys in South Carolina. Id. at 258-61, 503 S.E.2d at 793-94. This Court granted certiorari to address the express warranty cause of action, and the issues on appeal are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  Was the express warranty issue properly preserved for appellate review?\r\n  (2)  Did the Court of Appeals err in recognizing a new cause of action for legal malpractice based on a breach of an express warranty to obtain a specific result?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Issue Preservation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHitchcock argues that the Court of Appeals erred when it recognized a cause of action for legal malpractice based on breach of express warranty to obtain a specific result because the validity of this novel theory was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge, was not raised before the Court of Appeals by proper exception on appeal, and was not necessary to the determination of the issue on appeal. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court. Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731(1998). But see I'on v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, Op. No. 25048 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 1) (holding it is not always necessary for the lower court to rule on an issue for it to be preserved for appellate review where the issue is raised as an additional sustaining ground). First, Holy Loch specifically raised the express warranty issue in its Second Amended Complaint as their fourth cause of action. In their Second Amended Complaint, Holy Loch alleges:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Immediately after contact with the federal agents of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\"), the Plaintiffs advised Law Firm of the ATF's allegations and an agent and/or representative of Defendants made an express representation, guaranty, and/or warranty that the Plaintiffs had nothing to worry about and would be able to remain in business. Further, that the necessary licenses and/or permits would be acquired and that their visas were appropriate. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nSecond, the trial court ruled upon the express warranty issue in the Order of Dismissal with Prejudice. The Order specifically states \"Each of the four causes of action, professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and breach of warranty, cannot go forward against Defendants because the statute of limitations has run on all causes of action.\" (emphasis added). Therefore, breach of express warranty was not only before the trial court for consideration, but it was also specifically ruled on by the trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHitchcock also argues that the express warranty issue was not properly raised by exception on appeal. Hitchcock argues that the exceptions raised by Holy Loch on appeal address the express warranty cause of action only within the context of the statute of limitations issue. In Holy Loch's final brief to the Court of Appeals they raised the following issue: \"Did the Circuit Court err when it dismissed the fourth cause of action for breach of express warranty due to the expiration of the statute of limitations [S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-3-535 (Supp. 1996)] .\" If a court applies a statute of limitations to a cause of action, it is logical that the court issuing the ruling recognized the applicability of the cause of action. The issue presented by Holy Loch's brief included a discussion of the validity of a breach of express warranty as a cause of action. The issue of breach of express warranty to obtain a specific result was, therefore, properly before the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, Hitchcock addressed the express warranty issue extensively in their brief to the Court of Appeals. In their brief, Hitchcock distinguished the express warranty cases relied on by Holy Loch and argued there was no \"basis for Holy Loch to argue that the South Carolina Supreme Court had indicated any allowance for such claim.\" Hitchcock cannot argue the express warranty issue was not properly before the Court of Appeals when they: (1) never presented this non-preservation argument to the Court of Appeals; and (2) addressed the validity of the express warranty issue extensively in their brief to the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Express Warranty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHitchcock argues that the Court of Appeals erred in creating a new cause of action for legal malpractice based on breach of express warranty to obtain a specific result. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals did not need to adopt a new breach of an express warranty claim because Holy Loch had recourse under existing legal malpractice remedies based on negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. In South Carolina, attorneys are required to render services with the degree of skill, care, knowledge, and judgment usually possessed and exercised by members of the profession. See Norris v. Alexander, 246 S.C. 14, 142 S.E.2d 214 (1965). To prevail in a legal malpractice claim, the plaintiff must satisfy the following four elements: (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; (2) breach of duty by the attorney; (3) damage to the client; and (4) proximate causation of client's damage by the breach. Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Guerard, 322 S.C. 433, 472 S.E.2d 612 (1996). In the cases where it is alleged that an attorney expressly guarantees a result, the client has recourse under this existing cause of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, express guarantees by an attorney run the risk of constituting unethical and negligent conduct. Attorneys are advised never to make absolute promises to achieve particular results. However, a rule imposing strict liability is unnecessary because the current Rules of Professional Conduct,are adequate and may provide a basis of recovery against attorneys who make specific guarantees.1 See Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 2.1 and 7.1(b) (1990) (stating that attorneys have a duty to render candid advice and not to create an unjustified expectation about the results he or she can achieve).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has never considered whether to apply the breach of an express warranty cause of action to attorneys.2The only policy reasons provided by the Court of Appeals for extending the cause of action to attorneys was that there was no reason to treat attorneys different from other professionals who warrant a result. Holy Loch, 332 S.C. at 260, 503 S.E.2d at 794. However, the breach of express warranty theory would change the current standard of care for attorneys. Attorneys would be held strictly liable for failing to satisfy the alleged warranty, no matter how much care, skill, knowledge, and diligence was exercised in attempt to achieve the result. An express warranty cause of action would also adversely affect the attorney-client relationship by inhibiting the frank discussion between attorney and client concerning the merits of the case. The fear of an express warranty claim would discourage attorneys from advising clients of the potential for victory in their case because this advice might be construed as a guarantee or a warranty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the cases that have recognized an express warranty to obtain a specific result involving a professional are those where a product or some other tangible item is involved, such as dentures and architectural plans or specifications. See Tommy L. Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Jordan, Jones &amp; Goulding, 320 S.C. 49, 463 S.E.2d 85 (1995) (holding an engineer can be liable to a contractor for breaching an implied warranty that the plans and specifications were sufficient for purpose in view); Beachwalk Villas Condominium Ass'n, Inc. v. Martin, 305 S.C. 144, 406 S.E.2d 372 (1991) (holding an architect can be liable for breach of an implied warranty even though no privity exists between the architect and the home buyer); Burns v. Wannamaker, 281 S.C. 352, 315 S.E.2d 179 (Ct. App 1984), affirmed as modified 288 S.C. 398, 343 S.E.2d 27 (1985). In Burns; the Court of Appeals held \"that an express pre-treatment warranty to effect a particular result can be extended in South Carolina by a dentist.\" Burns, 281 S.C. at 353-354; 315 S.E.2d at 180. The Court of Appeals found that the dentist made express warranties as to the manufacture and fit of dentures. Id. Although there were no South Carolina cases that addressed this issue, the Court of Appeals found there was no reason why a dentist could not enlarge his responsibilities and contract as he sees fit. Id. at 354-355, 315 S.E.2d at 181 (citations omitted); see also Banks v. Medical Univ. of South Carolina, 314 S.C. 376, 444 S.E.2d 519 (1994) (recognizing a patient's right to recover for the breach of an express pre-treatment warranty to effect a particular result, but denying a patient's right to recover for the breach of an implied contract arising from a failure to provide adequate medical treatment). However, the facts of Burns are distinguishable from the instant case because the express warranty involved dentures, a product, not just the dentist's professional services.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Court of Appeals is reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Diane Schafer Goodstein, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Although the Rules of Professional Conduct do not give rise to specific causes of action or presumptions, the Rules are relevant and admissible in assessing the legal duty of an attorney in a legal malpractice case. Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 472 S.E.2d 612 (1996).\r\n\r\n2Louisiana is the only state to recognize a breach of an express warranty to obtain a specific result against an attorney. See Barnett v. Ziegler, 608 So.2d 1011 (La. App. 1992) (holding an attorney's breach of an express warranty of result is an action for breach of contract); Rhoden v. Wegmann, 569 So.2d 35 (La. App. 1990) (recognizing that the statute of limitations for an attorney malpractice action is different if it involves a breach of an express warranty); Hannie v. Wall, 569 So.2d 1044 (La. App. 1990) (finding there is a ten year prescriptive period when an attorney expressly warrants a particular result).\r\n\r\n3This Court has recently considered whether professionals who use\r\n  products in the course of their services can be held strictly liable under the\r\n  Uniform Commercial Code. In In re Breast Implant Product Liability\r\n  Litigation, 331 S.C. 450, 503 S.E.2d 445 (1998) this Court held that health\r\n  care providers may not be held strictly liable for products under the U.C.C.\r\n  provisions pertaining to express warranty, implied warranty of\r\n  merchantability, and implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25115","title":"Thompson v.

We reverse the PCR court, vacate Thompson's sentence, and remand for resentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 1993, Thompson killed Melvin Deshawn Williams by\r\nshooting him with a .45 caliber pistol. Thompson was indicted for murder in\r\nCharleston County in November 1994. On March 13, 1995, Thompson pled\r\nguilty to voluntary manslaughter pursuant to plea negotiations with the\r\nsolicitor. At the trial, the solicitor requested the maximum 30 year sentence in\r\nviolation of the plea agreement and Thompson's attorney did not object to the\r\nsolicitor's request. The trial judge imposed a 25 year sentence and this Court\r\naffirmed. State v. Thompson, Op. No. 96-MO-121 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 1,\r\n1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1996, Thompson filed an application for PCR based on\r\nineffective assistance of counsel. On August 12,1997, Thompson testified at the\r\nevidentiary hearing that he decided to enter a guilty plea because he was under\r\nthe assumption that: (1) he would receive a youthful offender sentence; (2) he\r\nwould receive no more than a 20 year sentence; and (3) the solicitor was not\r\ngoing to make a sentencing request or recommendation. Thompson testified at\r\nthe PCR hearing that he would not have pled guilty but for his attorney's advice\r\nas to the terms of the plea agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThompson's attorney testified at the PCR hearing that Thompson initially\r\nplanned to go to trial because the codefendant was not willing to testify against\r\nhim. Thompson decided to pursue a plea bargain only after the codefendant\r\ndecided to testify against him. During the plea negotiations, the trial judge told\r\nthe attorneys he would not consider a youthful offender sentence and he would\r\nimpose a sentence of at least 20 years, but not the maximum of 30 years.\r\nThompson's attorney testified that she explained to Thompson before the plea\r\nthat he could expect at least a 20 year sentence, but that the trial judge stated\r\nhe would not impose the maximum 30 year sentence. She also told Thompson\r\nthat the solicitor was not going to make a specific sentence recommendation.\r\nAccording to Thompson's attorney, Thompson \"went back and forth about\r\nwhether he was going to plead at that point for quite a while and then decided\r\nhe would go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solicitor requested the maximum 30 year sentence and Thompson's\r\nattorney did not object. The PCR court found that the solicitor breached the plea agreement by requesting a maximum sentence.. According to the PCR\r\ncourt, because Thompson's attorney advised him that he would receive at least\r\na 20 year sentence, but less than the 30 year maximum, Thompson suffered no\r\nprejudice as a result of his attorney's failure to object. The PCR court held that\r\nthe 25 year sentence was within the sentencing range under which Thompson\r\nagreed to plead guilty. On September 18, 1997, the PCR court denied\r\nThompson's application for PCR and dismissed it with prejudice. Thompson\r\nappealed and the following issue is before this Court:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR judge err in failing to find trial counsel was ineffective\r\n    for not objecting when the solicitor recommended that Thompson\r\n    be sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment in violation of\r\n    the negotiated plea agreement with the solicitor?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThompson argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object\r\nwhen the solicitor recommended that the trial judge impose the maximum\r\nsentence. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the burden is on the applicant to prove the\r\nallegations in his application. Bell v. State, 321 S.C. 238, 467 S.E.2d 926 (1996);\r\nRule 17.1(e), SCRCP. If there is any probative evidence to support the finding\r\nof the PCR judge, those findings must be upheld. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115,\r\n386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). Likewise, a PCR judge's findings should not be upheld\r\nif there is no probative evidence to support them. Holland v. State, 322 S.C.\r\n111, 470 S.E.2d 379 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR\r\napplicant must prove: (1) counsel failed to render reasonably effective\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassistance under prevailing professional norms; and (2) the deficient\r\nperformance prejudiced the applicant's case. Strickland v. Washington, 466\r\nU.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed.2d 674 (1984). A defendant who pleads\r\nguilty on advice of counsel may only attack the voluntary and intelligent\r\ncharacter of a plea by showing that counsel's representation fell below an\r\nobjective standard of reasonableness demanded of attorneys in criminal cases\r\nand there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, defendant\r\nwould not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. Rayford\r\nv. State, 314 S.C. 46, 443 S.E.2d 805 (1994). A reasonable probability is a\r\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial. Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, Thompson must demonstrate that his attorney's failure to object fell\r\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness demanded of attorneys in\r\ncriminal cases. At the PCR hearing, Thompson's attorney testified that she\r\ntold Thompson prior to the guilty plea \"that . . . [the solicitor] was not going to\r\nmake any specific recommendations for a particular number of years.\"\r\nThompson's attorney did not object when the solicitor recommended the\r\nmaximum sentence in violation of the', plea agreement. Furthermore, when\r\nasked by the trial judge whether the solicitor had correctly and completely\r\nstated the plea negotiations, Thompson's attorney claimed that he had and\r\nthere was nothing further that needed to be added regarding the plea\r\nnegotiations. The PCR court found the solicitor violated the plea agreement but\r\nthere was no prejudice to Thompson from his counsel's failure to object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts of this case are analogous to the facts of Jordan v. State, 297\r\nS.C. 52, 374 S.E.2d 683 (1988). In Jordan, the defendant agreed to plead guilty\r\nbecause he believed the solicitor would neither oppose nor recommend\r\nprobation. Id. at 54, 374 S.E.2d at 685. When the solicitor in Jordon reneged\r\non the plea agreement and recommended against probation, Jordan's attorney\r\nfailed to draw the plea judge's attention to the plea bargain and then failed to\r\nmove to withdraw Jordan's guilty plea. Id. We held that \"the conduct of\r\nJordan's counsel in not protecting Jordan's right to enforce the plea agreement\r\nwith the Solicitor's office fell below prevailing professional norms.\" Id. (citing\r\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed.2d 674\r\n(1984)). Like the attorney in Jordan, Thompson's attorney's failure to object fell\r\nbelow prevailing professional norms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge found, based on the colloquy at the plea, that Thompson\r\nwas not prejudiced because he was adequately informed of the twenty to thirty\r\nyear sentencing range. However, the fact that the judge sentenced Thompson\r\nwithin the range is irrelevant. To establish prejudice, the proper analysis is to\r\ndetermine whether there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\r\nunprofessional errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty and would have\r\ninsisted on going to trial. See Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88\r\nL. Ed.2d 203 (1985). In Jordan, this Court found prejudice because the\r\ndefendant had consistently insisted on; going to trial and only agreed to plead\r\nwhen he believed the solicitor would neither oppose nor recommend probation.\r\nJordan, 297 S.C. at 54, 374 S.E.2d at 685. According to this Court in Jordan,\r\n\r\n  Considering the original vehemence of Jordan in pursuing his right\r\n    to trial by jury, we further hold that there is a reasonable\r\n    probability that but for the fact that Jordan's attorney failed to\r\n  object to the continuation of the guilty plea proceeding once the\r\n  solicitor reneged on the plea bargaining agreement, that Jordan\r\n  would not have pleaded guilty, but would have insisted on going to\r\n  trial.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. Although Thompson did not specifically testify that he would have insisted\r\nupon going to trial if he had known the solicitor was going to make a\r\nrecommendation, he did testify that he would not have pled guilty if he had\r\nknown that he could have been sentenced to more than 20 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find there is enough evidence to demonstrate that there was a\r\nreasonable probability Thompson would not have pled guilty if he had known\r\nthe solicitor was going to make a sentencing recommendation. Thompson\r\ntestified that he believed the State's case against him was weak and he\r\noriginally agreed to plead guilty only if he received a youthful offender sentence.\r\nAfter Thompson was advised that the judge would not consider a youthful\r\noffender sentence, Thompson's attorney entered plea negotiations with the\r\nsolicitor. Wavering as to whether to go to trial until the last minute, Thompson\r\nentered his guilty plea in reliance on the sentencing range and the solicitor's\r\nagreement not to make any sentencing recommendation or request. At the PCR\r\nhearing, Thompson stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  My understanding with the recommendation of the Solicitor, as\r\n    explained to me through [my attorney], was that he was not\r\n    supposed to impose a sentence upon me. He was not to stand up in\r\n    court and testify as [sic] say that I recommend the maximum\r\n    sentence, in which he did.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that Thompson was unsure whether to plead guilty up until the last\r\nminutes before trial coupled with the fact that he was under the impression the\r\nsolicitor would not make a sentencing request is enough evidence to\r\ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that Thompson would not have pled\r\nguilty but for his attorney's ineffective assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the evidence presented in this case and this Court's holding in\r\nJordan v. State, 297 S.C. 52, 374 S.E.2d 683 (1988), we REVERSE the PCR\r\ncourt's order denying Thompson's application for PCR, vacate Thompson's\r\nsentence, and remand for resentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25116","title":"Ingram v.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED for four main reasons: (1) the Court of Appeals used no equity\r\ndoctrines, even though Ingram sought an equitable remedy; (2) the Court of\r\nAppeals did not strictly construe the option contract in favor of the optionor and\r\nagainst the optionee; (3) the Court of Appeals disregarded specific findings of\r\nfact made by the trial judge that Ingram was unable to pay the purchase price\r\nwithin the lease period; and (4) the Court of Appeals recognized only the\r\ngeneral rule of options, which does not apply to all option contracts in every\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1984, Ingram entered into a ten-year commercial lease with\r\nKasey's for Remy's Restaurant (\"Remy's\") located on Hilton Head Island, South\r\nCarolina. After entering into the lease, Ingram and Prescott entered into an\r\noral sublease for the operation of the restaurant, its furniture, fixtures, and\r\nequipment. As a part of this arrangement with Prescott, Ingram received a\r\npercentage of the profits from the video poker machines he installed in Remy's.\r\nFrom March 1, 1984 until the end of the lease term on February 28, 1994,\r\nPrescott operated the restaurant and paid the rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lease between Ingram and Kasey's contained a provision giving\r\nIngram the right to purchase the property at any time during the lease term for\r\na certain sum based upon an amortization schedule attached to the lease. The\r\nlease contained the following option to purchase:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lessee shall have the right to purchase the premises at any time\r\n    during the term hereof, as is described in this paragraph; provided\r\n    however, that this right shall terminate forthwith upon default of\r\n    the lessee, as provided in Paragraph 6 hereof.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the paragraph describes how to calculate the purchase price,\r\nlists the credits Ingram would receive if he purchased the property, and refers\r\nto the amortization schedule.\r\nDuring the fall of 1993, as the lease was nearing the expiration of the\r\n  term, Ingram and Kasey's discussed whether Ingram desired to purchase the\r\n  property. Ingram indicated he would not exercise his option and that Kasey's\r\n  and Prescott were free to negotiate a deal to lease the restaurant. Relying on\r\nIngram's representations, Kasey's and' Prescott entered into a new lease for\r\nRemy's to become effective on March 1, 1994, and Kasey's spent $135,000 to\r\nacquire adjacent property in order to expand Remy's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite his previous representations, on February 22, 1994, Ingram\r\nprovided written notice to Kasey's that he intended to exercise his option to\r\npurchase the property. The February 22,1994 letter to Bernard Craig (\"Craig\"),\r\ngeneral partner of Kasey's, states in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  This will serve to advise you that I am hereby exercising my option\r\n    and right to purchase the above-referenced premises pursuant to\r\n    the option contained in the above described lease Agreement dated\r\n    March 1, 1984, between Casey's [sic] Associates, a South Carolina\r\n    Limited Partnership, as Lessor, and myself, as Lessee.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nCraig responded with a letter on February 24, 1994 stating that Ingram had\r\nrepresented he was not going to exercise the option, and Craig had relied on\r\nthese representations by purchasing adjacent property and beginning\r\nrenovations on Remy's. Craig also advised Ingram that the property had to be\r\npurchased on or before the close of business on February 28,1994 in accordance\r\nwith the lease term: However, in the event Ingram paid the purchase price,\r\nKasey's executed its deed to Ingram and transmitted the deed to its attorney for\r\ndelivery to Ingram upon payment of the purchase price. Ingram never tendered\r\nany portion of the purchase money prior to the end of the lease term on\r\nFebruary 28, 1994. On March 8, 1994, Ingram wrote Craig that he was ready,\r\nwilling, and able to close the sale on March 10, 1994. Kasey's attorney\r\nresponded that he would not close because the lease required Ingram to tender\r\nthe purchase price before its expiration on February 28, 1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngram did not have the money to purchase the property on February\r\n28,1994, March 8, 1994, March 10,1994, or March 14, 1994. None of Ingram's\r\nlenders officially agreed to loan him the purchase money and Ingram had no\r\nwritten loan agreements. In fact, one of the lenders indicated the affidavit he provided to support Ingram's summary judgment motion was a \"hoax\" and that\r\nhe did not have the money to loan Ingram. The trial testimony also indicates\r\nthat none of the lenders identified by Ingram were contacted until after the\r\nlease expired on February 28, 1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 1994, Ingram sued both Kasey's and Prescott for specific\r\nperformance arising from his attempt to exercise his option to purchase\r\nproperty contained within the ten-year lease. Ingram also filed a lis pendens\r\non the leased real and personal property on March 14, 1994. On November 13,\r\n1995, the trial judge entered an order denying specific performance of the option\r\ncontract. Ingram appealed and on August 19, 1997, the Court of Appeals\r\nreversed the trial judge's decision and remanded the matter to the trial court\r\nfor further factual findings on the issues of estoppel, waiver, abatement of\r\npurchase price, Ingram's ability to close within a reasonable time, and unclean\r\nhands. Ingram v. Kasey's Assocs., 328 S.C. 399, 493 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nKasey's and Prescott have appealed on' the following issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding Ingram properly\r\n    exercised the option by sending written notice of his\r\n    acceptance, without tendering the actual purchase price,\r\n    prior to the expiration of the lease?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n  (2)  Did the Court of Appeals disregard specific findings of fact\r\n    made by the trial judge that Ingram was unable to pay the\r\n    purchase price either within the lease period or soon\r\n    thereafter?\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKasey's and Prescott argue that the Court of Appeals erred in holding\r\nthat written notice of Ingram's intent to exercise the option, without the actual\r\ntender of the purchase price, was sufficient to fulfill the terms of the option\r\ncontract. We agree. Our discussion will be divided into two parts. Part I will\r\naddress the law of specific performance because that is the equitable remedy\r\nIngram requests. Part II will address the law of options. The Court of Appeals\r\nfound there was one general, overriding rule that applied to all option contracts.\r\nAlthough this general rule exists, it does not apply to every circumstance. In\r\nparticular, when an option is embedded in another type of contract, such as a\r\nlease, option law depends greatly upon the context in which the option was\r\nentered.\r\nI.  Specific Performance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngram's action for specific performance of his option contract is in equity.\r\nCollier v. Green, 244 S.C. 367, 137 S.E.2d 277 (1964). In equity actions an\r\nappellate court can review the record and make findings based on its view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence. Townes Assoc. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81,\r\n221 S.E.2d 773 (1976); Pruitt v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint\r\nUnderwriting Ass'n, 335 S.C. 118, 515 S.E.2d 544 (Ct. App. 1999). However,\r\nthis Court is not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw\r\nand heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility.\r\nTiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 391 S.E.2d 538 (1989); Wright v.\r\nTask, 329 S.C. 170, 495 S.E.2d 222 (Ct. App. 1977).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific performance should be granted only if there is no adequate\r\nremedy at law and specific enforcement of the contract is equitable between the\r\nparties. King v. Oxford, 282 S.C. 307, 318 S.E.2d 125 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing\r\nMonteith v. Harby, 190 S.C. 453, 3 S.E.2d 250 (1939)). In order to compel\r\nspecific performance, a court of equity must find: (1) there is clear evidence of\r\na valid agreement; (2) the agreement had been partly carried into execution on\r\none side with the approbation of the other; and (3) the party who comes to\r\ncompel performance has performed his or her part, or has been and remains\r\nable and willing to perform his or her part of the contract. Gibson v. Hrysikos,\r\n293 S.C. 8, 358 S.E.2d 173 (Ct. App. 1987) (citing Thomson v. Scott, 6 S.C. Eq.\r\n(1 McCord Eq.) 32 (1825)). At a minimum, Ingram must demonstrate that he\r\nwas ready and willing to perform his part of the contract (i.e. willing to tender\r\nthe purchase price) on February 28, 1994, the date the lease expired, or on\r\nMarch 14, 1994, the date he brought the action for specific performance.1 The\r\nrecord indicates that Ingram was not in a position to pay Kasey's the purchase\r\nprice for Remy's on either date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngram admits that prior to February 28, 1994 he did not have the\r\npurchase money in .any depository account either under his control, his\r\nIngram v. Kasey's Associates, et al.,\r\nattorney's control, or in any escrow account. Ingram also admits that in order\r\nto close on the property he would have to \"scramble around and see if [he] could\r\nraise up the money.\" Although Ingram claims he had several sources who could\r\nprovide the purchase money, as of March 14,1994, none of his identified lenders\r\nofficially agreed to loan him the money, and he had no written loan agreements.\r\nIn fact, several lenders admitted they did not even have access to the money to\r\nloan Ingram. Specific performance is unsound in this case because Ingram\r\nlacked the ability to perform his part of the option contract on the date the\r\nlease expired and on the date he sought specific performance. See 71 Am. Jur.\r\n2d Specific Performance Â§ 201 (1973) (\"[C]omplainant in an action for specific\r\nperformance must aver that he has performed his part of the contract or that\r\nhe is willing and ready to perform it, and that he has performed all conditions\r\nprecedent to the taking effect of the obligation of the defendant, including the\r\npayment to be made thereon, or some valid excuse for his failure to perform or\r\noffer to perform.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, equity does not favor the granting of specific\r\nperformance as a matter of sound judicial discretion. We rely on the equity\r\nmaxim: \"He who seeks equity must do equity.\" Norton v. Matthews, 249 S.C. 71,\r\n152 S.E.2d 680 (1967). Ingram misled Kasey's and Prescott by promising he\r\nwould not exercise his option. In reliance on his representations, Kasey's and\r\nPrescott negotiated a new deal to lease Remy's. Ingram's misrepresentations\r\nwere particularly egregious because he knew Kasey's was planning to purchase\r\nproperty adjacent to Remy's for $135,000 in reliance on his promise not to\r\nexercise his option. According to Craig, Ingram was also aware that time was\r\nof the essence for Kasey's because, due to new zoning ordinances, Remy's could\r\noperate at the leasehold site only because it was grandfathered. Ingram's\r\nactions, therefore, placed Kasey's at great risk because Remy's needed to be in\r\ncontinuous operation in order to maintain its grandfathered status.\r\nAdditionally, the evidence demonstrates that Ingram only decided to exercise\r\nthe option on February 22, 1994 because he was in a dispute with Prescott over\r\nhow much Prescott would pay him for the right to run Remy's. Thus, Ingram\r\nhas an improper ulterior purpose for using Kasey's to pressure Prescott.\r\nIngram is estopped from seeking specific performance because he acted with\r\nunclean hands by misleading both Kasey's and Prescott, and because he acted\r\nwith the improper ulterior motive to force Prescott to pay him $40,000.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Option Contracts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOption contracts generally have three main characteristics: (1) they are\r\nunilateral contracts where the optionor, for a valuable consideration, grants the\r\noptionee a right to make a contract of purchase but does not bind the optionee\r\nto do so; (2) they are continuing offers to sell, irrevocable during the option\r\nperiod; and (3) the transition of an option into a contract of purchase and sale\r\ncan only be effected by an unqualified and unconditional acceptance of the offer\r\nin accordance with the terms and within the time specified in the option\r\ncontract. See generally J. R. Kemper, Necessity for Payment or Tender of\r\nPurchase Money Within Option Period in Order to Exercise Option, in Absence\r\nof Specific Time Requirement for Payment, 71 A.L.R.3d 1201, 1205 (1976). It is\r\nwell settled in South Carolina that option contracts are strictly construed in\r\nfavor of the optionor and against the optionee. See Cotter v. James L. Tapp Co.,\r\n267 S.C. 647, 230 S.E.2d 715 (1976). Furthermore, if the option requires\r\nperformance in a certain manner, time is of the essence and exact compliance\r\nwith the terms of the option are required. Id. at 653, 230 S.E.2d at 717-718.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, Ingram did not comply with the exact terms of the\r\noption contract because he did not purchase Remy's \"at any time during the\r\nlease's term.\" He provided written notice to Kasey's during the lease term\r\nindicating that he planned to exercise his option in the future. Generally,\r\nactual payment is essential to the acceptance of an option contract when\r\npayment is made a condition precedent to the exercise of the option. See 91\r\nC.J.S. Vendor and Purchaser Â§ 10 (1951); 77 Am. Jur. 2d Vendor and Purchaser\r\nÂ§ 53 (1997) (\"Where an option by its express terms requires that the payment\r\nof the purchase money or a part thereof accompany the optionee's election to\r\nexercise the option, the making or tender of the payment specified, unless\r\nwaived by the optionor, is a condition precedent to the formation of a contract\r\nto sell.\"). However, the Court of Appeals held that written notice was sufficient\r\nbecause once Ingram provided notice \"he bound himself to a bilateral and\r\nexecutory contract for the sale of land.\" Ingram, 328 S.C. at 407, 493 S.E.2d at\r\n860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals adopted the general rule of option contracts, or the\r\n\"Williston rule\" which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Especially in cases of options for the sale of land, most courts\r\n    interpret the option as conditioned upon the giving of a promise to\r\n    pay the price for the land, that is, as calling for the formation of a\r\n    bilateral contract rather than for tender of the actual performance,\r\n    which would be required for acceptance in a unilateral contract.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nIngram, 328 S.C. at 406, 493 S.E.2d at 860 (quoting 1 Richard A. Lord, Williston\r\non Contracts Â§ 5:18, 738-739 (4th ed. 1990)). In cases where the option contract\r\ndoes not explicitly require the payment of the purchase price as a condition\r\nprecedent to the exercise of an option, \"courts have generally been inclined to\r\nconstrue such agreements as calling simply for a promise by the optionee to pay\r\nthe price, rather than for actual payment thereof.\" 71 A.L.R. 3d 1201, 1219\r\n(1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether actual payment is required to exercise an option,\r\nit is important to look at both the specific language used in the option contract\r\nand also the context in which it was made. The Court of Appeals correctly cited\r\nthe general rule for the exercise of an option contract. However, this rule is not\r\napplicable to every circumstance. For example, an option provision embedded\r\nin a lease is very different than a free standing real estate option contract:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the absence of a provision in the option agreement specifying the\r\n    time or method of payment, the question of whether the purchase\r\n    price or a part thereof must be paid or tendered in order to exercise\r\n    the option has generally been found to depend on whether the\r\n    terms of the option require the payment of a fixed sum at the\r\n    expiration of a certain period, such as the term of a lease, in which\r\n    case payment is required in order to exercise the option.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n77 Am. Jur. 2d Vendor and Purchaser Â§ 53 (1997). Other courts have held that\r\na lease provision providing a lessee an option to purchase requires payment at the time of the exercise of the option. See Burns v. Reves, 457 S.E.2d 178 (Ga.\r\nApp. 1995) (lessee's option to purchase leased premises was lost where lessee\r\nonly notified landlord of intention to purchase property and purchase monies\r\nwere not secured within option period'); Hofmann v. Sullivan, 599 P.2d 505\r\n(Utah 1979).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, the use of a lease had practical significance to Kasey's.\r\nBecause of the incorporation of the town of Hilton Head and the enactment of\r\nnew zoning ordinances, Remy's could operate at the leasehold site only because\r\nit was grandfathered. Kasey's could not wait for Ingram to purchase the\r\nproperty at some \"reasonable time\" after he exercised his option because Remy's\r\nwould risk losing its grandfathered status if it did not remain in continuous\r\noperation. Also, the nature of a lease is different than that of a contract to sell.\r\nKasey's gave Ingram a lease for a specific duration and anticipated that a new\r\nlessee would take over the lease at the expiration of the lease's term. Kasey's\r\nis not forced to wait for Ingram to exercise his option at some \"reasonable time\"\r\nafter the expiration of the lease term because waiting on Ingram would unfairly\r\npenalize Kasey's by causing them to lose business profits, potential lessees, and\r\ngrandfathered status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther courts have adopted a fact-specific rule for the interpretation of\r\noption contracts involving leases. In Odyssey Glass Corp. v. Simenaur, 425 A. 2d\r\n249 (Md. App. 1981), the Maryland Court of Special Appeals held that the\r\nproper exercise of an option to purchase required tender of payment during the\r\nterm of the lease. The court held that the case \"must be determined on the\r\nbasis of its own specific circumstances.\" Id. at 253. The court found that the\r\nlessor's rapid response to the lessee's notice of intent indicated he was willing\r\nto sell the property for the stated price, as long as the transaction was\r\ncompleted during the lease term. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn option contract is interpreted according to its actual terms and the\r\ncontext in which the contract was made. In general, if the contract is\r\nunambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms\r\nthe parties have used, and the terms are to be taken and understood in their\r\nplain, ordinary, and popular sense. See C.A.N. Enterprises, Inc. v. South\r\nCarolina Health and Human Serv. Fin. Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d\r\n584, 586 (1988). If the option contract specifically makes the tender of the\r\npurchase price a condition precedent to the option's exercise, then the plain\r\nlanguage of the contract controls and actual tender is required. See Catawba\r\nAthletics, Inc. v. Newton Car Wash, Inc., 281 S.E.2d 676 (N.C. App. 1981) (\"If a\r\np.15\r\nlease and option to purchase realty is clearly expressed, it must be enforced as\r\nwritten and the court may not disregard the plainly expressed meaning of its\r\nlanguage.\"). However, in situations similar to the instant case, where the\r\noption contract only requires payment, \"at any time during the terms [of the\r\nlease],\" this Court will consider the context in which the contract was made and\r\nattempt to effectuate the intent of the contracting parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis rule does not conflict with current South Carolina case law. In fact,\r\nthe South Carolina cases dealing with option contracts have been decided on a\r\nfactual basis, recognizing the difference between a free standing option contract\r\nto purchase real estate and an option provision embedded in a lease. In Conner\r\nv. Alvarez, 285 S.C. 97, 328 S.E.2d 334, (1985), this Court applied the general\r\nrule (i.e. \"Williston rule\") to an option to purchase a house contained in a rental\r\nagreement. This Court held that the option was exercised when the purchaser's\r\nattorney sent a letter providing notice of intent to exercise the option. This\r\nCourt correctly applied the general rule as discussed by the Court of Appeals in\r\nIngram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Cotter v. James L. Tapp Co., 267 S.C. 647, 230 S.E.2d 715 (1976), this\r\nCourt held that a tenant's failure to comply literally with the terms of an option\r\nprovision to extend a lease negated his ability to exercise the option. This Court\r\nheld that the option required performance in a certain manner to renew the\r\nlease. The fact that the tenant gave notice that he wished to extend the option was irrelevant. The lessor was entitled to \"exact compliance with the terms of\r\nthe option and there is simply no way to equate a requirement to pay money\r\nwith the giving of notice.\" Id. at 653-654, 230 S.E.2d at 718.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on  the foregoing, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER; and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1The Court of Appeals expands the time for Ingram to tender themoney until a \"reasonable time\" after he provided written notice of his intent to exercise the offer. However, this time frame does not coincide with the specific performance Ingram requested. Ingram must be able to perform at the exact time he requested specific performance, not some \"reasonable time\" in the future.  \r\n2The doctrines of unclean hands and equitable estoppel can be used to\r\n  preclude Ingram from recovering in equity. Unclean hands precludes a\r\n  plaintiff from recovering in equity if he acted unfairly in a matter that is the\r\n  subject of the litigation to the prejudice of the defendant. First Union Nat. Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 511 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 1998). Elements of equitable estoppel as to the party estopped are: (1) conduct by the party estopped which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts; (2) the intention that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the true facts. As to the party claiming the estoppel, the elements are: (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; and (2) reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped. Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 500 S.E.2d 204 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25117","title":"State v.

Schusterman, of Rock Hill, for petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, of Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nBURNETT, A.J.: Petitioner asks this Court to reverse an opinion of the Court of Appeals affirming the trial court's decision to permit the State to use a pardoned offense to enhance the sentence for a subsequent offense. We reverse and remand for resentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1993, the South Carolina Board of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services issued petitioner a pardon for the following ten offenses:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  11/25/81 Public Disorderly Conduct\r\n    7/28/82 Assault and Battery\r\n    7/28/83 Destruction of Property\r\n    8/30/84  Simple Possession of Marijuana\r\n    5/19/86 Public Disorderly Conduct\r\n    6/16/86 Driving Under the Influence First\r\n    7/14/86 Possession of Marijuana\r\n    1/31/90  Disorderly Conduct and Violation of Open Container\r\n    5/24/90  Pointing a Firearm and Violation of SC Gun Law\r\n    7/24/90  Driving Under the Influence Second\r\n\r\nIn July 1995, petitioner was charged with DUI, third offense. Petitioner argued the 1995 DUI should be treated as a first offense, since his two prior DUIs were pardoned. After a hearing, the trial court ruled petitioner's pardoned offenses could be used to enhance the 1995 DUI charge. Petitioner appealed the trial court's ruling, but this Court dismissed the appeal without prejudice as premature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, petitioner was again arrested for DUI and brought before the same judge. Relying on his earlier ruling, the judge allowed the State to use petitioner's pardoned 1990 offense to enhance the current charge.1 After a bench trial, petitioner was convicted of DUI, second offense. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction. State v. Baucom, 334 S.C. 371, 513 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding a pardoned conviction may be used to enhance a subsequent offense?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends his pardoned conviction should not have been used to enhance the current offense. We agree with petitioner and remand for resentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question presented is one of statutory interpretation and reconciliation.2 The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible. Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d. 117 (1998). \"All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.\" Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d. 364, 366 (1994).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 24-21-940(A) of the South Carolina Code defines \"pardon\" to mean \"an individual is fully pardoned from all the legal consequences of his crime and of his conviction, direct and collateral, including the punishment, whether of imprisonment, pecuniary penalty or whatever else the law has provided.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-940(A) (1989) (emphasis added); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-1000 (1989) (\"[A] certificate of pardon shall be issued by the Board stating that the individual is absolved from all legal consequences of his crime and conviction, and that all of his civil rights are restored.\") (emphasis added). Section 24-21-990 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A pardon shall fully restore all civil rights lost as a result of a conviction, which shall include the right to:\r\n  (1) register to vote;\r\n  (2) vote;\r\n  (3) serve on a jury;\r\n  (4) hold public office, except as provided in Section 16-13-210;3\r\n  (5) testify without having the fact of his conviction introduced for impeachment purposes to the extent provided by Rule 609(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence;4\r\n  (6) not have his testimony excluded in a legal proceeding if convicted of perjury; and\r\n  (7) be licensed for any occupation requiring a license.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§24-21-990 (1989).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner was sentenced pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§56-5-2940 (1991 &amp; Supp. 1999), which provides for enhanced punishment for each subsequent DUI conviction. The statute provides that \r\n\r\n  [A]ny conviction, entry of a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere or forfeiture of bail, for the violation of any law or ordinance of this or any other state or any municipality of this or any other state that prohibits any person from operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or narcotics shall constitute a prior offense for the purpose of any prosecution for any subsequent violation hereof. Only those offenses which occurred within a period of ten years including and immediately preceding the date of the last offense shall constitute prior offenses within the meaning of this section.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held the italicized phrase \"any conviction\" necessarily includes pardoned convictions. Baucom, 334 S.C. at 384, 513 S.E.2d at 119. The Court of Appeals based its holding on the theory that a pardon involves forgiveness, but not forgetfulness. In other words, a pardon forgives the punishment for a crime, but does not forget or obliterate the act of the commission of the crime. See Baucom, 334 S.C. at 376, 513 S.E.2d at 114. We disagree. The pardon statute relieves the convict of \"all the legal consequences of his crime and conviction, direct and collateral, including the punishment, whether of imprisonment, pecuniary penalty or whatever else the law has provided.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§24-21-940(A) (1989). Punishment is only one of the consequences absolved by a pardon in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe the better way to approach this question is to ask whether enhancement of a subsequent sentence is a collateral legal consequence of the pardoned conviction. The pardon statute states unambiguously that \"an individual is fully pardoned from all the legal consequences of his crime and of his conviction, direct and collateral.\" Â§24-21-940(A). We conclude sentence enhancement is a forbidden collateral legal consequence of a pardoned conviction. The words \"any conviction\" in the repeat offender statute must be read in light of the plain language of the pardon statute. Baucom, 334 S.C. at 385, 513 S.E.2d at 119 (Howell, J., dissenting). The DUI statute was enacted subsequent to the pardon statutes. Thus, the legislature is charged with knowledge that a pardon relieves the convict of all the consequences of his conviction. See Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 53, 426 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1993) (\"A basic presumption exists that the legislature has knowledge of previous legislation when later statutes are passed on a related subject.\"). Moreover, penal statutes are to be strictly construed against the State and in favor of the defendant. State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991). Construing the term \"any conviction\" to include a pardoned conviction is inconsistent with strict construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis interpretation is supported by the specific exceptions enacted by the legislature to the general rule that a pardon relieves the convict of all legal consequences of his conviction. Under Â§Â§ 24-21-990 and 16-13-210, despite a pardon, a person convicted of embezzling public funds may not hold a public office unless the General Assembly removes the disability by a two thirds vote. S.C. Code Ann. Â§24-21-990 (1989) and  Â§16-13-210 (1985). Under Rule 609(c), SCRE, a conviction pardoned based on a finding of the rehabilitation (as opposed to innocence) of the person convicted, can be used to impeach a witness if the person has been convicted of a subsequent crime which was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. These exceptions are noteworthy because they demonstrate the General Assembly's readiness to expressly address pardons in situations where the legislature does not wish them to have full effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Court of Appeals majority erred in relying on this Court's opinion in Bay v. South Carolina Highway Department, 266 S.C. 9, 221 S.E.2d 106 (1975). We conclude Bay has been overruled by the enactment of  Â§24-21-940(A). In Bay, we held that a motorist whose convictions for reckless homicide and leaving the scene of an accident were pardoned was not entitled to have his driver's license suspensions revoked. We reasoned that \"[w]hile the pardon relieved respondent of his punishment, it did not operate to restore his driver's license, which his conviction forfeited.\" Id. at 13, 221 S.E.2d at 108. We noted that \"the suspension of respondent's license was a civil consequence of his convictions of reckless homicide and leaving the scene of an accident,\" not punishment for his crimes. Id. (emphasis added). In 1981, the General Assembly enacted Â§24-21-940(A), providing that a pardon relieves an individual of \"all the legal consequences . . . direct and collateral,\" of his conviction. See Act No. 100, 1981 Acts 333, 350, codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§24-21-940 to -1000 (1989). The language of the statute indicates the legislature's intent to overrule Bay. The statute absolves a pardoned convict of \"all legal consequences,\" not just criminal consequences. Since suspension of Bay's driver's license was a \"civil consequence,\" of his conviction, Bay is no longer good law. Even if this were not so, Bay would not be determinative since the question of statutory interpretation here was not before us in Bay, and we were thus free to make our own determination of public policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we share the reluctance of the State, the trial court, and the Court of Appeals to sentence petitioner as if the present offense were his first DUI, rather than his fourth, our holding is compelled by the plain and unambiguous language of the pardon statute. Our responsibility as members of the judicial branch is to interpret the statute before us. Determining proper criteria for granting pardons is the responsibility of the legislature and the executive branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1The 1986 conviction could not be used because it was over ten years old. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2940 (1991 &amp; Supp. 1998). Furthermore, the 1995 charges were\r\n  apparently dropped upon petitioner's 1996 conviction. \r\n2The Court of Appeals discussed in great detail the majority and minority rules on the effects of a pardon. According to the majority view, a pardon merely forgives the penalty for a crime, but does not blot out the fact of its occurrence. Therefore, a pardoned offense may be used to enhance. a subsequent conviction under repeat offender statutes. See G. Van Ingen, Annotation, Pardon as Affecting Consideration of Earlier Conviction in Applving Habitual Criminal Statute, 31 A.L.R.2d 1186 (1953 &amp; Supp. 1995). A minority of courts treats a pardoned offense as if it had never occurred. Thus, in these jurisdictions, a pardoned offense cannot be considered to enhance a subsequent offense. Id. \r\n3Section 16-13-210 provides that embezzlement of public funds is a felony, and \"a person convicted of a felony is disqualified from holding any office of honor or emolument in this State; but the General Assembly, by a two-thirds vote, may remove this disability upon payment in full of the principal and interest of the sum embezzled.\" S.C. Code Ann. &sect;16-13-210 (1985). \r\n4Evidence of a conviction is not admissible for impeachment purposes \"if (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon . . . based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted, and that person has not been convicted of a subsequent crime which was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, or (2) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon . . . based on a finding of innocence.\" Rule 609(c), SCRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25118","title":"Reynolds, et al. v.

Plaintiffs are subsequent purchasers of homes built by the defendant. Plaintiffs discovered inter alia3 cracks in the concrete slabs and alleged that the initial construction and development performed by the defendant is flawed. Defendant challenges the plaintiffs right to assert SCUPTA claims because of the plaintiffs remoteness from the alleged wrongdoing. The implied warranty and negligence claims are still pending before the United States District Court. This Court has agreed to answer the question certified by Judge David C. Norton of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina-Charleston Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina law, can Plaintiffs in a residential construction defects case sue Defendant builder, seller and developer under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act if Plaintiffs did not purchase their residences from Defendant but from the original homeowner more than three years after the initial sale?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act provides that \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\" S.C. Code Ann.  Â§ 39-5-20(a) (1985). Under S.C. Code Ann.  Â§ 39-5-140(a)(1985),\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages. If the court finds that the use or employment of the unfair or deceptive method, act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of  Â§ 39-5-20, the court shall award three times the actual damages sustained and may provide such other relief as it deems necessary or proper. Upon the finding by the court of a violation of this article, the court shall award to the person bringing such action under this section reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\nThere is no specific provision within the act which limits a cause of action to an immediate purchaser. However, plaintiffs failed to produce any cases directly on point and contend in their brief that Texas law supports the position which they urge this Court to adopt under SCUPTA citing Barrett v. U.S. Brass Corp., 864 S.W.2d 606, (Tex. Ct. App. 1993). In our opinion, plaintiffs' reliance on Barrett is misplaced. Barrett is neither persuasive nor helpful; in fact Barrett was overruled by the Texas Supreme Court in Amstadt v. U.S. Brass Corp., 919 S.W.2d 644 (Tex. 1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Texas Supreme Court consolidated Barrett v. United States Brass Corp. and several other cases to determine if their legislature intended the upstream suppliers of raw materials and component parts to be liable under Texas' version of SCUPTA, known as DTPA, when none of their alleged misrepresentations reached the consumers. It found that no homeowners in the consolidated cases could recover from the defendant companies under DTPA because the alleged violations did not occur in connection with the homeowners' purchase of their homes. The court held that defendant's deceptive conduct must occur in connection with a consumer transaction. The court found U.S. Brass had no role in the sale of the homes to plaintiffs. The court also found that \"rather than permit limitless upstream DTPA liability under these circumstances, the legislature more likely intended for consumers to seek DTPA recourse against those with whom they have engaged in a consumer transaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs ask the Court to hold the privity of contract is not required in a SCUPTA claim, by a subsequent purchaser from a builder/vendor. Plaintiffs recognize that the Court has taken a very active role in the construction area to protect innocent purchasers. The most noteworthy step has been the elimination of privity to protect an innocent purchaser who has invested his life savings from latent defects in a mobile society where it is foreseeable that more than the original owner will enjoy a home from a builder. See Terlinde v. Neely, 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (1980); JKT Company, Inc. v. Hardwick, 274 S.C. 413, 265 S.E.2d 510 (1980); and Lane v. Trenholm Building Co., 267 S.C. 497, 229 S.E.2d 728 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, plaintiffs look to Burbach v. Investors Management Corporation International, 326 S.C. 492, 484 S.E.2d 119 (Ct. App. 1997) to thwart contentions that it would be superfluous to have SCUPTA apply to construction cases where other causes of action exists. In Burbach, a former tenant of defendant brought an action seeking return of  a security deposit alleging conversion and violations of Residential Landlord and Tenant Act and South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. The defendant in this case argued that SCUTPA did not apply because the contract between the parties was a private contract and that the SCRLTA provides an exclusive remedy. The court found that residential leases are things of value, directly affect the citizens of this state, and that the conduct of the landlords is capable of repetition. The court held that the evidence was admissible to prove the plaintiffs' SCUPTA claim. In our opinion, plaintiff' s reliance on Burbach is misplaced since Burbach turns on the admissibility of evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no specific provision within SCUPTA which limits a cause of action to an immediate purchaser, we answer the certified question in the negative. We realize that suing under SCUPTA can be a very attractive remedy because the statute provides that if the deceptive act is willful, then the plaintiff may recover treble damages. However, subsequent purchasers are not without remedies. The courts and legislature have paved the way to allow subsequent purchasers to bring causes of actions in tort, negligence and implied warranties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, MOORE, JJ., and Acting Justice William T. Howell, concur. BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n1The plaintiffs are Paul C. Daugherty and Carol L. Daugherty (Daughterys) who purchased a home from its original owners on January 10, 1997 which was built and sold by the defendant on May 13, 1993 and Jay H. Reynolds and Theresa H. Reynolds (Reynolds) who purchased a home from its original owners on May 31,1996 which was built and sold by the defendant on January 27, 1993. \r\n2The defendant, Ryland Group, was not directly involved in the sale to the Daughertys or Reynolds.\r\n3Plaintiffs allege failure to address poor soils, building code violations, and unapproved modifications to the house plans after submitting the plans to Dorchester County building officials for approval and that the damages to the homes include cracked slabs and foundations, concrete of inadequate depths and strength, and decaying organics under the \"footprint\" of the houses.\r\nBURNETT, J.: I respectfully disagree. The question certified to us is purely one of statutory construction:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Under South Carolina law, can Plaintiffs in a residential construction defects case sue Defendant builder, seller and developer under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act if Plaintiffs did not purchase their residences from defendant but from the original homeowner more than three years after the initial sale?\r\n\r\nThe majority acknowledges \"there is no specific provision in the [South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices] Act which limits a cause of action to an immediate purchaser.\" It discusses the lack of cases on point, and concludes while nothing in the act limits a cause of action to an immediate purchaser, subsequent purchasers nevertheless may not sue under the SCUTPA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible. Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998). In construing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation. First Baptist Church of Mauldin v. City of Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 417 S.E.2d 592 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statute at issue reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (1985). By construing the plain wording \"any person\" to mean \"any person in privity with the builder\" the majority effectually limits the statute's operation. Had the legislature intended to impose a limitation on the operation of the SCUTPA by imposing a privity requirement, it could easily have done so. This statute was intended to give additional protection to victims of unfair trade practices. Young v. Century Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., 302 S.C. 320, 326, 396 S.E.2d 105, 108 (Ct. App. 1989) rev'd in-part on other grounds, 309 S.C. 263, 422 S.E.2d 103 (1992). The legislative intent to protect consumers is thwarted by the judicial imposition of further limitations on a plaintiffs ability to recover damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority relies on Amstadt v. United States Brass Corp., 919S.E.2d 644 (Tex. 1996). Amstadt held that upstream suppliers of component parts could not be held liable under Texas's Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) if the claimed violations did not occur in connection with the consumer transaction that gave rise to the claim. I do not find Amstadt persuasive on this question. Amstadt interprets a different statute, the DTPA, which contains very different statutory language than our SCUTPA. For example, the Texas statute specifically requires that a deceptive practice be \"relied upon by a consumer to the consumer's detriment.\" Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. Â§ 17.50 (1987 &amp; Supp. 1999). Furthermore, even under the DTPA, \"privity of contract is not required.\" Id. at 649. Finally, Amstadt dealt specifically with the liability of upstream manufacturers and suppliers of component parts, who \"exercised no control over the manufacture and installation of the finished systems of the homes.\" Church &amp; Dwight Co. v. Huey, 961 S.W.2d 560 (Tex. Ct. App. 1997). In contrast, the defendants here both built and sold the allegedly defective houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court should be very mindful of differences between the language of our act and those in other states. In Skilcraft Sheetmetal, Inc. v. Kentucky Machinery, Inc., 836 S.W.2d 907 (Ky. Ct. App. 1992), the Kentucky Court of Appeals interpreted Kentucky's Consumer Protection Act to require privity of contract based on statutory language limiting recovery to \"[a]ny person who purchases or leases goods or services . . . .\" The court concluded the \"language of the statute plainly contemplates an action by a purchaser against his immediate seller.\" Id. at 909. The court noted \"[t]he legislature had the option of enacting a statute which allows persons other than purchasers with privity of contract to bring an action under the Consumer Protection Act,\" and cited the Massachusetts statute as an example of one not so limited. Id. The Massachusetts act, similarly to ours, permits recovery to \"any person . . . who has been injured by another person's use or employment of any method, act or practice declared to be unlawful by [the consumer protection statute].\"1d  In Maillet v. ATF-Davidson Co., 552 N.E.2d 95 (Mass. 1990), the Massachusetts court held lack of privity was no bar to recovery under the act. The court noted that the former version of the act, which, like Kentucky's, read \"[a]ny person who purchases or leases. . .\" supported the defendant's position, but the omission of the language \"who purchases or leases\" effectively eliminated the requirement of privity. See id. at 99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, through both its courts and legislature, has previously been in the vanguard of protecting consumers, particularly in the area of home construction. See Terlinde v. J.F. Neely, Sr., 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (1980) (subsequent purchasers of home may sue builder in tort and contract), JKT Co. v. Hardwick, 274 S.C. 413, 265 S.E.2d. 510 (1980) (statutory implied warranty of merchantability extends to corporate plaintiff not in privity with defendant), Lane v. Trenholm Building Co., 267 S.C. 497, 504, 229 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1976) (\"Our legislature continues to place South Carolina in the vanguard of consumer protection.\"). The General Assembly, in other consumer protection contexts, has evidenced its intent to provide the maximum protection to consumers of defective products. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-318 (1976) (\"A seller's warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who may be expected to use, consume or be affected by the goods and whose person or property is damaged by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of this section.\"). In JKT Co., we stated in response to the defendant's argument Â§ 36-2-318 only abolished the privity requirement as to \"natural persons\" that \"we do not believe the doctrine of privity in South Carolina has sufficient vitality to permit its resuscitation by Celotex as a bar to JKT's recovery.\" JKT Co., 274 S.C. at 417, 265 S.E.2d at 512. I am baffled by the majority's resurrection of the long dead privity requirement in light of these precedents and the legislature's omission of any language in the SCUTPA even suggesting its intent to limit recovery to persons in privity with the wrongdoer. Furthermore, imposing a privity requirement would bar suits for unfair or deceptive practices by competitors, which have previously been upheld. See, e.g., Global Protection Corp. v. Halbersber , 332 S.C. 149, 503 \r\nReynolds, et al. v. The Ryland Group, Inc., et al.\r\nS.E.2d 483 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. denied (April 22, 1999) (suit by competitor).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous limitations already in place on a plaintiff's ability to bring a SCUTPA suit, such as the requirements that an action be brought in a plaintiff's individual capacity (Â§ 39-5-140(a)) and that the plaintiff allege and prove the defendant's actions adversely affected the public interest. See Daisy Outdoor Advertising Co. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, 473 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996) and cases cited therein. Moreover, the lack of a privity requirement in no way suggests that plaintiffs under the SCUTPA need not prove a causal connection between the deceptive practices and their injury. See Â§39-5-140(a) (injury must occur \"as a result of \" the violation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority appears to hold that subsequent purchasers are barred from suing under the SCUTPA simply because there are other remedies available. However, the conduct prohibited by the SCUTPA is not merely duplicative of that addressed by the law of torts, contracts, and warranties. See Suminski v. Maine Appliance Warehouse, Inc., 602 A.2d 1173, 1174 (Me. 1992) (violation of UTPA requires unfair or deceptive conduct, not merely failure to honor statutory warranties). I would hold that privity of contract is not a prerequisite to maintaining a cause of action under the SCUTPA. I express no opinion as to the merits of plaintiffs' SCUTPA claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The Massachusetts act is broader than ours in that it permits recovery for personal injury, as well as loss of money or property.

Savitz, III, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W.McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, AssistantAttorney General Derrick K. McFarland, Assistant Attorney General S. CreightonWaters, of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, forrespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nBURNETT, A.J.: Appellant admitted he shot and killed Bill Welborn and Jarrod Champlin. He maintained the shootings were in self-defense. Appellant was convicted of two counts of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. The jury found one statutory aggravating circumstance and recommended a sentence of death.1 The trial judge sentenced appellant to death and a concurrent sentence of five years' imprisonment. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJody Fogle testified appellant arrived unexpectedly at his home at 10:00 p.m. on January 8, 1996. According to Fogle, appellant told him he wanted help moving some things. During the drive to appellant's home, appellant told Fogle about two men who had put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him. Fogle stated appellant demonstrated by holding a .22 gun to his head. Fogle testified he took the gun from appellant, determined it was loaded, then placed it on the car seat. A .38 revolver was on the dash of the car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFogle testified Welborn and Champlin were at appellant's home. He denied meeting either Welborn or Champlin previously. Fogle described Welborn and Champlin as \"wired\" as if on drugs. Champlin asked appellant to return his gun. Appellant gave Champlin the .22, the same gun appellant had been handling in the car. Appellant went into his bedroom; Fogle could hear appellant fumbling around in the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFogle testified.Champlin asked him if he had some \"dope.\" Fogle responded negatively. Champlin \"chambered a round\" in the gun, worked the slide, came towards Fogle stating \"[I'm] going to kill [your] lying a_ _,\" and pointed the gun at Fogle's chest. Fogle testified he could tell Champlin was serious; he admitted, at that time, he would have shot Champlin if he had been able. Welborn told Champlin to give him the .22 and Champlin complied. A couple of seconds later, appellant shot Welborn three times with the .38 revolver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant testified Fogle had previously met Welborn. He explained while at a New Year's Eve party ten days before the shooting, Welborn asked appellant if he knew where he could get some crystal \"meth,\" an illegal drug. Appellant stated no one at the party had the drug. Later, Fogle arrived at the party. Appellant testified Fogle had crystal methamphetamine. Appellant introduced Fogle to Welborn. He was not certain if a drug transaction occurred, but Welborn inquired if there was an automatic teller machine at the bank next door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant testified two nights before the shootings Welborn put an unknown amount of money in his pocket. Later the same evening, he returned the money to Welborn; he was unsure if he returned all of the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant testified on January 8, 1996, he was at the restaurant he owned when Welborn and Champlin arrived. Welborn remained outside in a car. Appellant went outside and asked Welborn why he did not come inside and Welborn stated appellant owed him $40. Appellant gave Welborn $40 from the restaurant cash register and Welborn came inside the restaurant. Appellant described Welborn as \"real agitated,\" \"wired,\" \"just acting unusual,\" \"just full of energy.\" Appellant described Champlin as \"hyper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant, Welborn, and Champlin left the restaurant. Appellant testified Welborn asked if appellant was afraid to die and commented about the $40. The three men went to a bar. Appellant testified Welborn was \"still acting real antsy,\" \"pacing the pool table.\" He thought Welborn was \"coming down off of a high.\" Appellant described Champlin as \"antsy, kind of wired, same as [Welborn] was acting, but not as bad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant stated while he was in the bathroom at the bar, Welborn came up behind him, grabbed him around the throat, and hit him in the head with a metal object which he thought was either a gun or a cigarette lighter. Welborn asked again about the $40 and stated \"[y]ou don't do your f'ing friends like that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant left the bar with Welborn and Champlin.3 He testified Welborn and Champlin asked him to get them some drugs. Appellant left Welborn and Champlin at his home and went to Fogle's home. He testified he did not take Welborn and Champlin with him because Fogle had previously told him he did not want any customers at his home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant picked up Fogle and drove him to his (appellant's) home in order for Fogle to provide Welborn and Champlin with drugs. Appellant testified when he and Fogle entered his house, Welborn was on the telephone. Welborn hung up, put his arm around appellant's neck, and asked if they were going to \"score.\" Appellant heard some noise. Champlin was cursing and pointing a gun at Fogle. Appellant testified he thought Champlin was going to shoot Fogle. He stated he had no idea why Champlin pulled a gun on Fogle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant stated he was scared and ran into his bedroom to \"get away.\" He realized there was no exit, obtained his pistol, placed it in his back pocket, and returned to the living room in order to leave through the front door. He was opening the front door when Welborn yelled \"Whoa. Where the F are you going?\" Appellant turned around; Welborn was pointing a gun at him. Appellant testified he thought Welborn was going to shoot him. When he heard a \"click,\" appellant pulled his revolver and shot Welborn multiple times. Welborn did not fire any shots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant testified he immediately thereafter shot Champlin, although he agreed he was not paying attention to Champlin and Fogle while he was in the bedroom and while he was reacting to Welborn. He testified he shot Champlin because \"I thought he was going to shoot me.\" He admitted Champlin never pointed a gun at him. Appellant testified he did not know Champlin had given his gun to Welborn and Champlin was no longer armed. Appellant concluded he shot Welborn and Champlin \"[b]ecause I thought I was going to get shot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUILT PHASE ISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. Did the trial judge err by refusing to instruct the jury that, in regard to self-defense, a defendant has a right to act on appearances and does not have to wait before acting?\r\n  II. Did the trial judge err by refusing to instruct the jury on defense of others?\r\n  III. Did the trial judge err by refusing to allow the defense to question an inmate concerning allegations the prosecution had attempted to procure false testimony?\r\n  IV. Did the trial judge err by refusing to allow the defense to impeach Dawn Brudos by establishing she had a romantic relationship with Welborn?\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by refusing to provide the jury with more specific instructions regarding self-defense. He contends the judge should have instructed the jury A) he had the right to act on appearances and B) he did not have to wait before shooting. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to self-defense, the trial judge instructed the jury, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Self-defense is a complete defense. If established you must find the defendant not guilty. Now, in this case there are three elements that you would consider that are required by law to establish self-defense. First, first (sic), the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty. Second, he must have actually believed actually believed (sic) that he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury or he actually was in such imminent danger. Third, if his defense is based upon his belief of imminent danger, then the reasonable person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same belief. If a defendant actually was in imminent danger, then the circumstances must have been such as would warrant a person of ordinary firmness, prudence and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or losing his own life.4\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. 440, 377 S.E.2d 328 (1989), this Court held it error for the trial judge to exclusively charge the Davis instruction on self-defense when the defendant requests additional charges and the evidence supports the requests. The Court instructed the trial court to fashion an appropriate self-defense charge based on the facts and circumstances of each case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Fuller, the defendant requested a charge that he had the right to act on appearances. Quoting State v. Jackson, 227 S.C. 271, 278-279, 87 S.E.2d 681, 684-685 (1955), the Court set forth an appropriate charge on right to act on appearances:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A defendant must show that he believed he was in imminent danger, not that he was actually in such danger, because he had the right to act on appearances, and under the circumstances as they appeared to him, he believed he was in such danger and a reasonable prudent man of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same belief.\r\n\r\nState v. Fuller, supra S.C. at 443-444, S.E.2d at 331; see also State v. Gandy, 113 S.C. 147, 148, 101 S.E. 644 (1919)(\"A man may act, however, from appearance, and if it turns out, if the appearances are such that a man of ordinary courage, firmness, and prudence would have been justified in coming to the conclusion that the necessity did then and there exist to strike to save himself from serious bodily harm or death that would be sufficient, although it turned out afterwards that there was no actual danger present, and that the necessity to strike did not exist.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant was not entitled to an appearance charge in regard to the Welborn shooting. According to appellant, he was in actual danger when Welborn pointed a gun at him, cursed him, and questioned him as to where he was going. Appellant's claim to self-defense did not arise from a perceived, but rather an actual threat. Since there was no evidence appellant was acting on appearances, he was not entitled to an appearance charge. See State v. Lewis, 328 S.C. 273, 494 S.E.2d 115 (1997)(defendant not entitled to insanity charge where no evidence supported the charge).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contends appellant was not entitled to an appearance charge with respect to the Champlin shooting because he did not testify he thought he saw a gun in Champlin's hand at the time of the shooting. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right to act on appearances is not limited to the situation where the defendant testifies he mistakenly thought he saw a weapon in the victim's hand. While an appearance charge is appropriate when the defendant erroneously believes he sees the victim with a weapon,6 it has been applied elsewhere. In State v. Jackson, supra, the defendant testified he shot the victim after being awakened in his home by an intruder and blinded by a flashlight. The defendant did not testify he saw what appeared to be a weapon in the victim's hand. In fact, the defendant testified he could not see anything. The Court held the defendant was entitled to a charge on self-defense, including language on appearances.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant was entitled to an appearance charge in regard to the Champlin shooting. Immediately prior to the shooting, appellant observed Champlin hold a gun to Fogle's head and threaten to shoot him, apparently because the intended drug deal, which appellant had arranged, had gone awry. Welborn then pointed a gun at appellant and threatened to kill him as he attempted to leave. Unaware Champlin had passed his weapon to Welborn when appellant was in the bedroom, appellant erroneously believed Champlin was armed and intended to kill him. The trial judge should have charged the jury appellant had the right to act on appearances.8 State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 472 S.E.2d 241 (1996)(the law to be charged is determined from the evidence presented at trial). Refusal to give a requested instruction on appearances necessitates reversal. State v. Nichols, supra; State v. Fuller, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn charging self-defense, the trial court must consider the facts and circumstances of the case in order to fashion an appropriate charge. State v. Fuller, supra. Once the right to fire in self-defense arises, a defendant is not required to wait until his adversary is on equal terms or until he has fired or aimed his weapon in order to act. State v. Hendrix, 270 S.C. 653, 244 S.E.2d 503 (1978). Similarly, \"[the accused] doesn't have to wait until his assailant gets the drop on him, he has the right to act under the law of self-preservation and prevent his assailant (sic) getting the drop on him.\" State v. Rash, 182 S.C. 42; 50, 188 S.E. 435, 438 (1936).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts presented at trial entitled appellant to a self-defense charge in regard to both shootings. Appellant testified Welborn pointed a gun at him and he believed Champlin was armed. Appellant did not have to wait for Welborn or Champlin to fire or aim at him before acting in self defense. Accordingly, appellant was entitled to a charge instructing the jury he did not have to wait before acting in self-defense. Refusal to charge this request was reversible error. State v. Nichols, supra (where defendant requested charge he did not have to wait before acting in self-defense and the trial court gave a common-law instruction on self-defense, refusal to give the requested charge was reversible error).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by refusing to instruct the jury on defense of others. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the theory of defense of others, one is not guilty of taking the life of an assailant who assaults a friend, relative, or bystander if that friend, relative, or bystander would likewise have the right to take the life of the assailant in self-defense. State v. Long, 325 S.C. 59, 480 S.E.2d 62 (1997). \"[I]n order for the trial court to give a defense of others charge, there must be some evidence adduced at trial that the defendant was indeed lawfully defending others.\" Douglas v. State, 332 S.C. 67, 73, 504 S.E.2d 307, 310 (1998); see also William S. McAninch &amp; W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina (3rd ed. 1996)(\"There must, of course, be some evidence that the defendant was defending others at the time of his act in order for him to be entitled to the instruction.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant was not entitled to a charge on defense of others. Appellant testified after Champlin threatened Fogle, he went into his bedroom \"to get away.\" He realized there was no exit, obtained his revolver, then returned to the living room to leave through the front door. At this point, Welborn verbally threatened appellant and pointed a gun at him. Appellant specifically maintained he shot Welborn and Champlin because he thought they were going to shoot him. At no point did appellant suggest he shot either Welborn or Champlin to protect Fogle. Accordingly, he was not entitled to a charge on defense of others. See State v. Alford, 264 S.C. 26, 212 S.E.2d 252 (1975)(where defendant did not testify he was shooting for purpose other than to protect himself, he was not entitled to charge on defense of others).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by refusing to allow the defense to question an inmate concerning allegations the prosecution had attempted to procure false testimony. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant testified in his own defense. On cross-examination, appellant denied while awaiting trial he told four inmates he planned to murder Welborn and Champlin, pre-dug their graves, and wanted to hire someone to kill Gwen Ott.9Thereafter, appellant called Chris Kopel as a defense witness. Kopel testified for several months he was appellant's cellmate in the Lexington County Detention Center. He testified an assistant solicitor met with him and asked him if he had ever heard appellant threaten Ott's life. Kopel responded negatively. The solicitor objected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a proffer, Kopel stated the assistant solicitor asked him if he would be willing to testify that he had heard appellant threaten Ott. Kopel believed the assistant solicitor was asking him to lie. The trial judge sustained the objection, stating appellant could cross-examine the four inmates if the State called them in reply. In reply, four inmates testified appellant told them he had planned to kill Welborn and Champlin, had pre-dug their graves, and wanted to hire someone to murder Ott. No testimony concerning actions on behalf of the Solicitor's Office or Sheriff's Department was elicited from these witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, SCRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKopel's testimony was irrelevant to any issue at trial. His testimony neither established the prosecution actually presented perjured testimony at appellant's trial nor impeached the testimony of the four inmates who testified in reply as he did not state the prosecution had attempted to procure false testimony from them. Moreover, the allegation the assistant solicitor attempted to procure false testimony is not relevant to the issues in appellant's trial. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in ruling Kopel's testimony inadmissible. State v. Lewis, 293 S.C. 107, 359 S.E.2d 66 (1987)(admission or rejection of proffered testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial judge; absent an abuse of discretion, the ruling will not be disturbed on appeal).10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by refusing to allow the defense to impeach Dawn Brudos by establishing she had a romantic relationship with Welborn. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrudos was the first witness offered at trial. She testified she had known Welborn since 1993 and worked for his skydiving business. She testified Welborn, Champlin, and Champlin's girlfriend had been living in her home since mid-December 1995. Brudos testified two nights before the shootings Welborn was upset appellant had not returned $40 to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, defense counsel asked if Brudos had a romantic relationship with Welborn at the time of his death. She answered affirmatively. The solicitor objected. Defense counsel argued the question was relevant to establish Brudos' bias. After an in camera hearing, the trial judge sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question and answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to meaningful cross-examination of adverse witnesses. \"[A] criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby 'to expose the jury to the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to reliability of the witness.'\" Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d 674, 684 (1986)(emphasis added), quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S.Ct. 105, 111, 39 L.Ed.2d 347, 355 (1974). A trial judge, however, may impose limits on defense counsel from inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness to prevent harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, repetitive or marginally relative examination. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 608(c), SCRE, also permits a party to impeach a witness by establishing bias or prejudice either through examination or otherwise. \"`On cross-examination, any fact may be elicited which tends to show interest, bias, or partiality' of the witness.\" State v. Brewington, 267 S.C. 97, 101, 226 S.E.2d 249, 250 (1976) quoting 98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 560a (1957). A witness' romantic relationship with a party is a source of potential bias of which the jury should be aware in order to fully evaluate the witness' testimony. McIntyre v. State, 934 P.2d 770 (Alaska App. 1997); Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc. v. McIntosh, 452 S.E.2d 159 (Ga. App. 1994); State v. Erby, 289 S.E.2d 86 (N.C. App. 1982).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder both the Sixth Amendment and Rule 608(c), SCRE, appellant was entitled to inquire if Brudos had a romantic relationship with Welborn. Certainly, an intimate relationship between Brudos and Welborn could affect Brudos' credibility. The trial judge erred by prohibiting appellant from making this inquiry.11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENTENCING PHASE ISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  V. Did the trial judge err by refusing to instruct the jury appellant was ineligible for parole?\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues he was entitled to a charge on parole ineligibility after the solicitor placed his future dangerousness in issue. He contends the trial judge's refusal to instruct the jury that he was parole ineligible violated his due process rights.12 We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the State places the defendant's future dangerousness at issue and the only available alternative sentence to the death penalty is life imprisonment without parole; due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury he is parole ineligible. Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994); State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996). Due process is violated when the State \"raises [s] the specter of [the defendant's] future dangerousness generally, but then thwart[s] all efforts by [the defendant] to demonstrate that, contrary to the prosecutor's intimations, he never would be released on parole and thus, in his view, would not pose a future danger to society.\" Simmons v. South Carolina, supra, U.S. at 165 (plurality opinion). 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time Simmons was decided, South Carolina's capital sentencing scheme provided if the jury did not find a statutory aggravating circumstance, a death-eligible defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment and eligible for parole in twenty years. If the jury found a statutory aggravating circumstance and did not recommend death, the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment and eligible for parole in thirty years. S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-20(A)(Supp. 1993). However, if the defendant had a prior conviction for certain violent crimes, he was ineligible for parole. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. 1993).14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Act No. 83, Â§10, 1995 Acts 557, the General Assembly amended the sentencing options for capital murder. Effective January 1, 1996, Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 1998) provides, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (A) A person who is convicted of... murder must be punished by death, by imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years. If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt. . ., and a recommendation is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, \"life imprisonment\" means until death of the offender. No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section. No person sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years pursuant to this section is eligible for parole or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years required by this section ....\r\n  (B) When the State seeks the death penalty, upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant of murder, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding. In the proceeding, if a statutory aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant must be sentenced to either death or life imprisonment. If no statutory aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant must be sentenced to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years ....\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the new sentencing scheme, if the jury does not find a statutory aggravating circumstance, a death-eligible defendant may be sentenced to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence at the discretion of the trial judge. Under either sentence, the defendant is ineligible for parole or any form of credit which would reduce the length of the sentence. However, if sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence, the defendant would be unconditionally released from prison at the completion of thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimmons is inapplicable under the new sentencing scheme. By its own terms, Simmons requires the jury be informed the defendant is parole ineligible only if no other sentence than death, other than life without the possibility of parole, is legally available to the defendant. Id., U.S. at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring)(\" [a]lthough the only alternative sentence to death under state law was life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. . .\".)(emphasis added).15This interpretation is supported by decisions from other jurisdictions. Ramdass v. Angelone, 187 F.3d 396 (4th Cir. 1999)(Simmons is inapplicable if, at time of sentencing proceeding, defendant is parole eligible under state law; hence where judgment had yet to be entered for defendant's third murder conviction, defendant was parole eligible under \"three strikes\" law); United States v. Flores, 63 F.3d 1342 (5th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 825 (1996)(because sentencing guidelines vest district court with discretion to adjust life sentence downward, life sentence without possibility of parole is not only legal sentence other than death which defendant might receive and, therefore Simmons is inapplicable); Allridge v. Scott, 41 F.3d 213 (5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1108 (1995)(Simmons applies where capital defendant is ineligible for parole as a matter of law; Simmons does not apply even if it is unlikely defendant would be paroled); People v. Simpson, 665 N.E.2d 1228 (Ill.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 982 (1996)(Simmons inapplicable where capital defendant is statutorily eligible for a sentence less than natural life imprisonment); State v. McLaughlin, 462 S.E.2d 1(N.C. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1133 (1996)(Simmons inapplicable where alternative to death is not life imprisonment without possibility of parole). Under the new statute, a sentence other than life without the possibility of parole is an available alternative to the death penalty.16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the rationale for Simmons simply does not exist when there is a potential mandatory minimum thirty year sentence. Contrary to a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence does not rebut the State's argument regarding the defendant's threat to society. For this same reason the Court has repeatedly declined to apply Simmons when the defendant is parole eligible. State v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 501 S.E.2d 122, cert. denied, 525 U.S., 119 S.Ct. 597 (1998); State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997); State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57, cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1277 (1996); State v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 472 S.E.2d 235 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1061 (1997). Accordingly, because a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence was a legally available sentence, appellant's due process was not violated when the trial judge refused to instruct the jury appellant was parole ineligible. 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, appellant argues because the jury had already convicted him of two murders, it was bound to find the statutory aggravating circumstance of \"two or more persons murdered by the defendant by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct\" and, therefore, the only available sentence alternative to death was life without the possibility of parole. We find it inappropriate to assume the jury will find a statutory aggravating circumstance. Appellant's jury could have concluded that while appellant murdered Welborn and Champlin, the two murders were not pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the jury could have failed to find the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance, a potential mandatory minimum thirty year sentence existed and appellant was not entitled to a charge on parole ineligibility. United States v. Flores, supra (district court did not violate the principles of Simmons by refusing to inform the jury the defendant would be sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole because a lesser sentence, dependent on the jury's findings, was available).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, MOORE, JJ., and Acting Justice William T. Howell, concur- FINNEY, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J.: I respectfully dissent from the majority's opinion insofar as it holds appellant was not entitled to a jury charge that he was parole ineligible pursuant to Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2178, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994). As I explained in my dissent in State v. Shafer, Op. No. 25120, (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 8, 2000) all capital defendants are now parole ineligible under the 1996 amendments to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 1999). Appellant thus meets the two prerequisites for a Simmons charge: (1) parole ineligibility and (2) argument regarding future dangerousness. All the state cases cited by the majority as supporting its decision not to apply Simmons are distinguishable because in each the defendant faced a potentially parolable sentencing option under state law. The decision in United States v. Flores, 63 F.3d 1342 (5th Cir. 1995) is simply unhelpful since parole has been abolished in the federal system. For these reasons, and the reasons given in my Shafer dissent, I would reverse the denial of appellant's request for a Simmons charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\"Two or more persons were murdered by the defendant by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.\" S.C. Code Ann. &sect;16-3-20(C)(a)(9)(Supp. 1998). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2The evidence is recited in the light most favorable to appellant.\r\n3A waitress testified as appellant and Welborn left the bar, Welborn stated to her in front of appellant, \"you need to call Lexington County because [I] am going to take [appellant] up on Platt Springs Road and blow his f'ing brains out.\" \r\n4The language is taken directly from State v. Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 317 S.E.2d 452 (1984).\r\n\r\n5Appellant submitted written proposed jury instructions. Request to Charge No. 3 states: \"If a person's right to fire in self-defense arises, he is not required to wait until his opponent is on equal terms or until his opponent has fired or aimed his weapon.\" Request to Charge No. 8, in part, states: \"[The defendant] had the right to act on the appearance of things at the time, taken in light of all the evidence. One has the right to interpret the conduct of the other party in light of all of the circumstances at the time of the incident.\" During the charge conference, appellant stated, in addition to the standard State v. Davis, supra, self-defense instruction, he also requested the judge instruct the jury on \"[a]ppearances and whatnot and so forth.\" The trial judge indicated the substance of appellant's proposed instructions were included in his charge.\r\n6See State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997)(where defendant testified he saw a shiny object in victim's hand and thought it was a gun, he was entitled to charge on appearances); State v. Fuller, supra (where defendant testified he saw two victims open the trunk of their vehicle and thought he saw a shiny object in one victim's hand, he was entitled to charge on appearances).\r\n\r\n7In older cases, the reference to \"acting on appearances\" was routinely included in that portion of the self-defense charge regarding belief of imminent danger. See State v. Pridmore, 163 S.C. 73, 161 S.E. 335 (1931); State v. Francis, 155 S.C. 432, 152 S.E. 677 (1929); State v. Strickland, 147 S.C. 514, 145 S.E. 404 (1928).\r\n80f course, the jury would also have to find a reasonable, prudent man of ordinary firmness and courage would have believed he was in imminent danger under the circumstances.\r\n9At the time of the shootings Ott was appellant's live-in girlfriend. Ott helped appellant bury Welborn and Champlin. She reported appellant's involvement in the shootings in May 1996.\r\n\r\n10Allegations of improper conduct by the Solicitor's Office could be raised at a hearing on prosecutorial misconduct.\r\n\r\n11Although it is appropriate to perform a harmless error analysis when a party alleges he was denied the right to cross-examine a witness for bias, such an analysis is unnecessary here because appellant has been granted a new trial.\r\n\r\n12U.S. Const. amend. XIV, cl. 1. Appellant does not allege an Eighth Amendment violation.\r\n\r\n13For purposes of this discussion, we assume the solicitor placed appellant's future dangerousness in issue.\r\n14Simmons was parole ineligible pursuant to &sect;24-21-640. \r\n15 Keel v. French, 162 F.3d 263, 270 (4th Cir. 1998)(recognizing \"that Justice O'Connor's concurrence actually represents the holding in Simmons.).\r\n\r\n16The dissent contends the cases cited herein are inapposite. As explained in State v. Shafer, Op. No. 25120 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 8, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 18 at 35), each of the referenced cases fully support the conclusion due process did not require the trial judge to instruct the jury appellant was parole ineligible. \r\n17 Further, we note the sentencing statute provides for a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence. Based on the language of the statute, it is arguable a defendant sentenced to more than thirty years is eligible for parole after service of thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25120","title":"State v.

Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25120Heard October 7, 1999- Filed May 8, 2000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        David I. Bruck, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E.Pope, of York, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nBURNETT, A.J.: Appellant admitted he shot and killed Ray Broome while attempting to rob the convenience store where Broome was working. Appellant maintained the killing was without malice.1 A jury convicted appellant of murder, attempted armed robbery, and conspiracy. He was sentenced to death for murder and consecutive terms of twenty years' imprisonment and five years' imprisonment, respectively, for attempted armed robbery and conspiracy.2 Appellant appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAround 11:30 p.m. on April 12, 1997, appellant and Justin Porter drove to the Hot Spot, a convenience store, in Porter's truck. Appellant and Porter entered the store. When they returned to the truck, Porter, the driver, spun the back tires of the vehicle and appellant, using his father's gun and bullets he purchased earlier, fired four or five shots from the passenger window as they drove away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt approximately 1:00 a.m., appellant, Porter, and Adam Mullinax returned to the Hot Spot. Witnesses left the Hot Spot because they suspected trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant, Porter, and Mullinax entered the Hot Spot. Mullinax went into the bathroom then returned to the truck. Appellant and Porter also went into the store, then stood outside the Hot Spot for a few minutes. While Broome was away from the cash register, Porter entered the Hot Spot. He tried to open the cash register but was unsuccessful. He returned outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPorter and appellant entered the store again. Broome had returned to the register booth. Appellant went to the checkout counter and shot Broome from several feet away. Broome fell to the floor. Appellant walked to another side of the register, fumbled with the gun, leaned over the register counter, and shot Broome a second time.3Appellant and Porter's attempt to open the cash register failed. Appellant and Porter left. There is no evidence appellant or Porter asked Broome for money before the shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree young women arrived as appellant and Porter fled the Hot Spot and jumped into the truck. One of the women ran into the store, found Broome on the floor, and telephoned for emergency services. When the police arrived, Broome was still breathing. He had been shot twice in the head.4 Broome died at the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant wrapped Mullinax's shirt around the gun and initially hid it in the woods. He hid his own shirt and Porter's shirt elsewhere. Twelve hours after the shooting, appellant told an employee at another convenience store he was going to the park to shoot basketball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his arrest, an investigator asked appellant had Broome done anything to cause appellant to shoot. Appellant responded: \"No. We were sitting around in the woods talking about what we were going to do with him, and I'm the one that had the gun, and I guess I just snapped.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. Did the trial court err by refusing to instruct the jury appellant was parole ineligible?\r\n  II. Did the trial judge err by granting the State's motion to prohibit both the prosecution and defense from referring to the Bible or using religious references during closing argument?\r\n  III. Did the trial judge err by refusing to allow appellant to reopen the record to present evidence on deterrence or, alternatively, for a curative instruction after the solicitor argued the general deterrent effect of the death penalty?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues, for various reasons, the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury he was parole ineligible. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter closing arguments, relying on Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), appellant requested the trial court instruct the jury he would be ineligible for parole. The trial court denied the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter, the trial judge instructed the jury \"life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant.\" He later stated: \"[i]n deciding whether to sentence the defendant to death or to life imprisonment, I remind you that death means just what it says, death. Life imprisonment means incarceration of the defendant until his death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter three and one-half hours of deliberation, the jury returned with the following questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Is there any remote chance for someone convicted of murder to become eligible for parole?\r\n  2. Under what conditions would someone convicted for murder be eligible?\r\n\r\nRegarding Question 1, appellant agreed the trial court should instruct the jury \"life imprisonment means until the death of the offender\" and requested the court read the portion of Â§16-3-20(A) which explains no person sentenced to life imprisonment is eligible for parole or any other form of release or credits which would reduce a life sentence. Appellant stipulated Question 2 could not be answered. After the trial judge informed the parties of his intended response to the jury's questions, appellant requested the trial judge delete any reference to parole eligibility.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The trial judge responded to the jury's questions as follows:\r\n  Your consideration is restricted to what sentence to recommend. I will remind you that what you recommend is what I will impose as trial judge. Section 16-3-20 of our Code of Laws as applies to this case in the process we're in states that, 'for the purposes of this section life imprisonment means until the death of the offender.' Parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAppellant excepted stating, \"we would renew our objection under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the State and Federal Constitutions.\" The trial judge noted the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues he was entitled to a charge on parole ineligibility after the solicitor placed his future dangerousness in issue. He contends Simmons mandates a parole ineligibility instruction and refusal to give the charge violated his right to due process. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the State places the defendant's future dangerousness at issue and the only available alternative sentence to the death penalty is life imprisonment without parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury he is parole ineligible. Id.; State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996). Due process is violated when the State \"raise[s] the specter of [the defendant's] future dangerousness generally, but then thwart[s] all efforts by [the defendant] to demonstrate that, contrary to the prosecutor's intimations, he never would be released on parole and thus, in his view, would not pose a future danger to society.\" Simmons , 512 U.S. at 165 (1994) (plurality opinion).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant was tried under the new sentencing scheme which became effective on January 1, 1996. S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-20 (Supp. 1998). Under the new sentencing scheme, a defendant can be sentenced to 1) death, 2) life without the possibility of parole, or 3) a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence. We recently held Simmons is inapplicable under the new sentencing scheme because life without the possibility of parole is not the only legally available sentence alternative to death. State v. Starnes, Op. No. 25119 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 8, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 18 at 17).7 Accordingly, appellant's due process rights were not violated by the trial judge's refusal to instruct the jury appellant was parole ineligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues Simmons mandates a charge on parole ineligibility when the State argues future dangerousness and the jury's sentencing recommendation is limited to death or life without the possibility of parole, even though some other sentence is available. We do not read Simmons so narrowly. By its own terms, Simmons requires the trial judge instruct the jury the defendant is parole ineligible only if no other sentence than death, other than life without the possibility of parole, is legally available to the defendant. Simmons, U.S. at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"[a]lthough the only alternative sentence to death under state law was life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. . .\".) (emphasis added). This interpretation is supported by decisions from other jurisdictions. Ramdass v. Angelone, 187 F.3d 396 (4th Cir. 1999) (Simmons is inapplicable if, at time of sentencing proceeding, defendant is parole eligible under state law; hence where judgment had yet to be entered for defendant's third murder conviction, defendant was parole eligible under \"three strikes\" law); United States v. Flores, 63 F.3d 1342 (5th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 825 (1996) (because sentencing guidelines vest district court with discretion to adjust life sentence downward, life sentence without possibility of parole is not only legal sentence other than death which defendant might receive and, therefore Simmons is inapplicable); Allridge v. Scott, 41 F.3d 213 (5th Cir. 1994); cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1108 (1995) (Simmons applies where capital defendant is ineligible for parole as a matter of law; Simmons does not apply even if it is unlikely defendant would be paroled); People v. Simpson, 665 N.E.2d 1228 (Ill.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 982 (1996) (Simmons inapplicable where capital defendant is statutorily eligible for a sentence less than natural life imprisonment); State v. McLaughlin, 462 S.E.2d 1(N.C. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1133 (1996) (Simmons inapplicable where alternative to death is not life imprisonment without possibility of parole). At the time appellant's jury began its deliberations, three alternative sentences were available. Since one of these alternatives to death was not life without the possibility of parole, Simmons was inapplicable.8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the failure to inform the jury he was parole ineligible violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against the arbitrary infliction of the death penalty.9 He specifically argues the failure to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility prevented him from presenting mitigating evidence in support of a sentence less than death and diminished the reliability of the jury's sentencing decision. In light of the new sentencing statute, he asks the Court to reconsider its policy prohibiting the trial judge from informing the jury a capital defendant is parole ineligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, we note this issue is not properly preserved for appellate consideration. After the trial judge responded to the jury's question, appellant stated he excepted \"on the basis of the Eighth Amendment.\" He offered no explanation or argument in support of the exception. Appellant's objection to the supplemental instruction is simply too vague for the Court to review. State v. Bailey, 253 S.C. 304, 170 S.E.2d 376 (1969) (general objection leaves nothing for Court to review). Clearly, appellant never argued, as he does now, that the Eighth Amendment requires a charge on parole ineligibility as mitigating evidence and to ensure the reliability of the sentence imposed. McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 479 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1996) (an objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error so that it can be reasonably understood by the trial judge).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any event, the Eighth Amendment requires that a death sentence not be imposed arbitrarily. Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373 (1999). It prohibits the State from limiting the sentencer's consideration of \"any relevant mitigating evidence\" which could cause the jury to decline to impose the death penalty. Pane v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 822 (1991), citing Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 114 (1982). The United States Supreme Court has \"deferred to the State's choice of substantive factors relevant to the penalty determination.\" California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 1001(1983). Whether parole eligibility is relevant to the sentencing determination is a matter of state law. Id.; see Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 176 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"[t]he decision whether or not to inform the jury of the possibility of early release is generally left to the States.\").10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, parole eligibility is not relevant to a jury's sentencing considerations. State v. Young, 319 S.C. 33, 459 S.E.2d 84 (1995) (defendant who was parole eligible after service of thirty years not entitled to charge on parole eligibility). The refusal to inform the jury of the capital defendant's parole eligibility does not violate the Eighth Amendment. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have never explicitly ruled whether the Eighth Amendment entitles a capital defendant to a charge informing the jury he is parole ineligible, precedent suggests no such instruction is required.11 In State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (Chandler, J., concurring), the Court held the defendant who was parole ineligible due to a prior conviction for a violent crime was not entitled to a charge informing the jury of his parole ineligibility. In State v. Southerland, 316 S.C. 377, 447 S.E.2d 862 (1994), cert. denied 513 U.S. 1166 (1995), overruled on other grounds State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995), we concluded there was no Eighth Amendment violation where the trial judge did not instruct the jury the defendant was parole ineligible but defense counsel argued \"life imprisonment\" means the defendant will never be released from prison. In Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), the United States Supreme Court declined to hold the Eighth Amendment requires the jury to be informed a capital defendant is parole ineligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelying on Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1 (1986), appellant asserts parole ineligibility is a mitigating circumstance of which the jury should have been informed. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the Eighth Amendment prohibits the State from limiting the sentencer's consideration of \"any relevant mitigating evidence.\" Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 822 (1991). For purposes of the Eighth Amendment, mitigating evidence is \"any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 4, citing Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110 (1982); see State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996) (mitigating circumstances are details specific to the character of the defendant on trial and/or the circumstances of the crime he committed which are considered in order to reduce the degree of his moral culpability or guilt). In Skipper, the Supreme Court held evidence of the defendant's good behavior while in jail awaiting trial was potentially mitigating because it indicated he would not pose a danger in the future. Accordingly, excluding evidence of the defendant's future adaptability violated the Eighth Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike a defendant's behavior in prison, parole ineligibility is not an aspect of a defendant's character or record. Parole eligibility or ineligibility is a legislative determination; it is not mitigating evidence. See State v. Patterson, 299 S.C. 280, 384 S.E.2d 699 (1989), vacated on other grounds 493 U.S. 1013 (1990) (information regarding requirements for parole eligibility is not mitigating evidence); State v. Matthews, 296 S.C. 379, 373 S.E.2d 587 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1091(1989) (punishment for a crime cannot serve as a mitigating sentencing consideration); see also State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996) (the general effect of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime is not a mitigating circumstance). The Eighth Amendment is not violated by refusing to inform the jury a capital defendant is parole ineligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant asserts since all capital defendants are now parole ineligible, the Court should permit juries to be informed of parole ineligibility. He claims providing juries with accurate information on parole ineligibility will eliminate prejudicial misinformation juries hold concerning parole eligibility and produce more reliable sentencing determinations. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditionally, in South Carolina it is the jury's duty and responsibility in the sentencing phase of a capital trial to impose a punishment authorized by law in consideration of the circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the individual defendant. The jury is not authorized to legislate a plan of punishment. State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619, cert. denied 467 U.S. 1265 (1984); see State v. Atkinson, 253 S.C. 531, 172 S.E.2d 111(1970), citing State v. White, 142 A.2d 65, 76 (N.J. 1958) (\"the Legislature committed to the jury the responsibility to determine in the first instance whether punishment should be life or death. It charged another agency with the responsibility of deciding how a life sentence shall be executed. The jurors perform their task completely when they decide the matter assigned to them upon the evidence before them. What happens thereafter is no concern of theirs.\"), overruled on other grounds State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). The jury's duty is the same under the new sentencing statute. While a defendant's parole ineligibility could affect the jury's decision, it nonetheless remains an irrelevant factor which the jury should not consider. Affirmatively mentioning an irrelevant factor would undermine the jury's decisionmaking process and result in a decision which is less, rather than more, reliable. As a matter of policy, we maintain it is inappropriate to inform the jury the capital defendant is parole ineligible. The Eighth Amendment does not compel a different result. Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373,__, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 2099 (1999) (a death sentence is not arbitrary within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment \"if the jury is not given any bit of information that might possibly influence the individual juror's voting behavior.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge's supplemental instruction was erroneous. He contends 1) in responding to the jury's questions, the trial judge should have informed the jury he was parole ineligible, 2) the trial judge's admonition, \"parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration,\" incorrectly suggested he was parole eligible, and 3) the trial judge erred by refusing to read that portion of the sentencing statute which referred to parole ineligibility. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted above, parole eligibility or ineligibility is not relevant to a capital jury's sentencing considerations and the issue of parole should not be injected into the jury's deliberations. State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998); State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d. 315 (1991). When a jury inquires about parole, the trial court should instruct the jury it shall not consider parole eligibility in reaching its decision and the terms \"life imprisonment\" and \"death penalty\" should be understood in their ordinary and plain meaning. State v. Norris, 285 S.C. 86, 328 S.E.2d 339 (1985), overruled on other grounds State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn keeping with Norris, the trial judge's supplemental instruction properly told the jury not to consider parole eligibility or ineligibility. Although Norris was decided prior to the new sentencing statute, we find no reason to require a different response when the jury inquires about parole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, as noted above, three potential sentences were available: 1) death, 2) life imprisonment, or 3) a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence. Appellant was not eligible for parole under any of these sentences.13Nonetheless, as suggested by appellant, by asking for information on parole, the jury was attempting to ascertain the length of time appellant would realistically spend in prison if sentenced to life imprisonment. Informing the jury appellant was parole ineligible when, unbeknownst to the jury, he faced a possible sentence of thirty years imprisonment after which he would be unconditionally released would not have fairly responded to the jury's inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, contrary to appellant's argument, the trial judge's admonition, \"parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration,\" did not suggest appellant was parole eligible. Unlike the admonitions in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), \"you are not to consider parole\" and parole \"is not a proper issue for your consideration,\" the instruction here specifically informed the jury not to consider either parole eligibility or ineligibility and, therefore, did not imply appellant was parole eligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, in response to the jury's questions, appellant requested the trial judge read that portion of the sentencing statute highlighted below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by death, imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years. If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to subsections (B) and (C), and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, `life imprisonment' means until the death of the offender. No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section. No person sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years pursuant to this section is eligible for parole or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years required by this section.\r\n\r\nSection 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find no error or prejudice from the trial judge's refusal to read the highlighted portion of the statute. Again, neither parole eligibility nor parole ineligibility are proper considerations for the jury. State v. Ard, 332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998); State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). Furthermore, appellant's suggestion that providing the jury with the highlighted language would promote \"truth-in-sentencing\" is tenuous. The highlighted text provides the jury with only those portions of the sentencing statute which appellant deems avorable but excludes any reference to other less favorable sentencing options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude the supplemental instruction was appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues he was deprived of his right to make religious arguments to the jury. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver appellant's objection, the trial judge granted the State's motion to prohibit. references to the Bible or religion during closing argument by both the prosecution and defense. Appellant proffered several religious arguments he had considered including in his closing argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In his closing argument, appellant stated:\r\n  There's a story about a woman who broke the law a long, long, long time ago. Before we had electricity, before we had lethal injection, we still had the death penalty. There was a time that she had been caught, she was caught for breaking the law, and the people in her community gathered around her, and they were going to kill her for what she had done. They had the objects they were going to use to kill her in their hands, and she stood before them. Somebody walked in and said 'I'm not denying that what she did was wrong, this isn't about what she did was wrong, this is about what statement are you going to make about being confronted with this.'\r\n  The story that I referenced, a very great man discussed with them about not killing the woman, and they didn't.\r\n\r\nWe find no error in the trial judge's ruling. Previously, we have held there is no fundamental unfairness when the trial judge precludes the solicitor and the defense from arguing about God or religion. State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760, cert. denied 522 U.S.__ , 118 S.Ct. 146 (1997). In any event, the. record clearly demonstrates appellant was not prejudiced by the trial judge's ruling. Although he was not permitted to make all of his religious arguments, appellant conveyed the Biblical story of Jesus and the adulterous woman. State v. Bennett, 328 S.C. 251, 493 S.E.2d 845 (1997) (capital defendant was not prejudiced by sustained objection to his religious argument where record indicated he made the argument nonetheless). The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in granting the State's motion to prohibit references to the Bible or religion during both the prosecution and defense closing arguments. See State v. Patrick, 289 S.C. 301, 345 S.E.2d 481 (1986)14(trial judge is vested with broad discretion in dealing with the range and propriety of closing arguments and ordinarily his rulings on such matters will riot be disturbed).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the penalty phase closing argument, the solicitor argued the death penalty deters others from committing murder. Thereafter, appellant requested the trial judge either reopen the case to allow him to present statistical evidence the death penalty does not deter murder or, alternatively, to instruct the jury to disregard the solicitor's comments regarding general deterrence. The trial judge denied both requests. Appellant argues this was error. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, our case law is abundantly clear: while both the prosecution and defense may argue their respective opinions regarding the general deterrent effect of the death penalty, neither may present evidence supporting their views. State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996).15Accordingly, the trial judge did not err by refusing appellant's request to reopen the record for the purpose of presenting evidence on the deterrent effect of the death penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have never directly held it is reversible error to refuse to give such a curative instruction where the solicitor argues general deterrence. See State v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 472 S.E.2d 235 (1996), cert.\r\ndenied 519 U.S.__ , 117 S.Ct. 695 (1997) (where solicitor argued specific deterrence, requested charge on general deterrence was not required); State v. Longworth, 313 S.C. 360, 438 S.E.2d 219 (1993), cert. denied 513 U.S. 831 (1994) (where solicitor did not argue general deterrence, refusal to charge general deterrence need not be considered); State v. Patterson, 285 S.C. 5, 327 S.E.2d 650 (1984), cert. denied 471 U.S. 1036 (1985), overruled on other grounds State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (refusal to charge general deterrence is properly refused as function of jury is to determine appropriate penalty for present charge). In fact, our cases have repeatedly allowed the solicitor to argue his opinion regarding the deterrent effect of capital punishment. State v. Truesdale, 301 S.C. 546, 393 S.E.2d 168, cert. denied 498 U.S. 1074 (1990); State v. Jones, 298 S.C. 118, 378 S.E.2d 594 (1989); State v. Yates, 280 S.C. 29, 310 S.E.2d 805 (1982), cert. denied 462 U.S. 1124 (1983), overruled on other grounds State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). Since argument on general deterrence is permitted, it would be illogical to instruct the jury it may not consider the effect of its sentence on others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, in light of his freedom to argue capital punishment does not discourage others from committing murder, appellant's due process was not violated by the trial judge's denial of his request to present evidence on general deterrence or charge the jury not to consider the deterrent effect of the death penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude the death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the jury's finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance is supported by the evidence. See S.C. Code Ann.Â§16-3-25 (1985). Further, we hold the death penalty is neither excessive nor disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases. See State v. Hughes, 328 S.C. 146, 493 S.E.2d. 821(1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S.__ , 118 S.Ct. 1674 (1998); State v.

Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1103 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice Thomas C. Huff, concur. FINNEY, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1During the penalty phase of trial, appellant's expert witness testified appellant shot Broome in response to a lifetime of abuse and violence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2The jury found the statutory aggravating circumstance of murder while in the commission of an attempted armed robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. S.C. Code Ann. &sect;16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(d) (Supp. 1998).\r\n3Appellant waited eight seconds before firing the second shot.\r\n4All the events inside the Hot Spot were recorded on the store's security camera.\r\n5All issues stem from the sentencing phase of appellant's trial.\r\n6The trial judge stated he would charge the jury as follows: \"[y] our consideration is restricted to what sentence to recommend. I will, as trial judge, impose the sentence you recommend. Section 16-3-20 of the South Carolina Code of Laws provides that for the purpose of this section life imprisonment means until the death of the offender. Parole eligibility is not for your consideration.\"\r\n\r\n7In Starnes, we suggested, under the terms of the statute, it is arguable a defendant could be sentenced to more than thirty years and be eligible for parole after service of thirty years. For purposes of this discussion, we assume appellant was parole ineligible.\r\n\r\n8The dissent contends the cases cited herein are inapposite. Although the sentencing alternatives under consideration in each case referenced above may differ from those in South Carolina's new capital sentencing statute, each of the cases support the conclusion due process requires the jury be informed the capital defendant is parole ineligible where the only sentencing alternatives are death or life without the possibility of parole and the prosecution argues the defendant's future dangerousness. Excepting Flores, in each of the cases cited above, the capital defendant was parole eligible, therefore, due process did not mandate the jury be informed the defendant was parole ineligible. In Flores, although parole ineligible, the federal district judge could have departed from the sentencing guidelines and imposed a sentence less than life imprisonment. Accordingly, due process did not require the jury be informed Flores was parole ineligible. As fully discussed in State v. Starnes, supra, because death and life without the possibility of parole are not the only sentence alternatives under the new sentencing statute, due process does not require the jury be informed the defendant is parole ineligible. \r\n9U.S. Const. amend. VIII. \r\n10O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U.S. 151, 165 (1997) (\"[i]n Simmons, the Court carved out an exception to the general rule described in Ramos by, for the first time ever, requiring that a defendant be allowed to inform the jury of the postsentencing legal eventualities.\").  \r\n11Appellant agrees there has been a blanket prohibition against any instruction on parole eligibility or ineligibility.\r\n12In Ard we held the trial judge's erroneous mention of parole was harmless. To the extent Ard suggests the trial judge should charge the jury on parole eligibility if requested by the defendant, it is overruled. We note Ard was decided eight months after the present case was tried.\r\n  \r\n13 But see footnote 7.\r\n14Overruled on other grounds Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 \r\n\r\nS.E.2d 614 (1999); State v. Casey, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391(1991).\r\n15Because the General Assembly has approved the propriety of capital punishment, evidence attempting to establish its effectiveness or ineffectiveness as an instrument of deterrence is irrelevant.\r\nFINNEY, C.J.: I respectfully dissent, and would reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the 1996 amendments to S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-3-20, all capital defendants face one of three sentences:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) death; or\r\n  (2) life in prison until death; or\r\n  (3) unconditional release after service of a minimum term of thirty years, with no possibility of parole.1\r\n\r\nAppellant contends that since he was parole ineligible as a matter of state aw, the jury was entitled to be charged this fact when they inquired. I agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority deems the holding in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2178, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994), inapplicable because appellant's sentencing options were not limited to death or life without possibility of parole, and cites a number of cases in support of this proposition. In all the cited cases except one, however, the defendant's sentencing possibilities included one in which he would be parole eligible. The only case in which the defendant did not face a potential parolable sentence was United States v. Flores, 63 F.3d 1342 (5th Cir. 1995). Flores involves a federal conviction, and parole has been abolished in the federal system. It is inapposite to the present South Carolina sentencing scheme, as are all the other cases cited. While I concede that Simmons does not directly control this case 2, the overriding principle to be drawn from that decision is that due process is violated when a jury's speculative misunderstanding about a capital defendant's parole eligibility is allowed to go uncorrected. Here, the jury's inquiry prompted a misleading response which suggested parole was a possibility. In my opinion, due process mandates reversal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, if the decision whether to inform juries which inquire about parole eligibility is simply one of policy, as the majority suggests in Part I C, then why not adopt a policy which gives the jurors the simple truth: no parole. The majority acknowledges, as it must,3that parole considerations \"could\" affect a jury's sentencing decision,4 but then deems it \"irrelevant\" and denigrates its importance as \"[a] bit of information that might possibly influence the individual juror's voting behavior.\" The specter of parole haunts every capital sentencing proceeding in this State, and I cannot understand why, given the simplicity of our new sentencing scheme in which no capital defendant is ever parole eligible, we would make a policy decision prohibiting the dissemination of the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, I would not stop with a charge that the defendant was not parole eligible, for that is only half the truth. I would tell the jury that if no aggravating circumstance is found, the defendant faces a minimum of thirty years without possibility of early release, but that if aggravating circumstances are found, then the alternatives are death or life in prison until death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, and with instructions that henceforth juries which inquire shall be charged the truth about sentencing, I would reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In this opinion and in State v. Starnes, Op. No. 25119 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 8, 2000), the Court has avoided directly deciding the parole eligibility status of a. capital defendant who receives a term of years sentence. In my opinion, we must decide this question today in order to address the jury charge issues raised by appellant. The murder statute is clear as to certain defendants: \"No person sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years pursuant to this section is eligible for parole... or any other credits which would reduce the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years required by this section.\" &sect; 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1999). Since the murder statute is silent as to the parole eligibility of defendants receiving a sentence in excess of the mandatory minimum, the general rule controls. Under &sect;16-1-10(d)(Supp. 1999), murder is exempt from the classification system, and under &sect; 24-13-100 (Supp. 1999), persons convicted of exempt offenses are ineligible for parole. Thus, although a capital defendant may receive a sentence of a term of years, he is ineligible for parole whatever the duration of that term. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2We are not concerned with whether a Simmons charge was warranted at the initial charge to the jury since future dangerousness was not an issue, but rather with the procedure to be followed when a capital jury inquires about parole.\r\n\r\n3Given the regularity with which capital juries inquire about parole, we cannot deny its role in sentencing.\r\n4See Bowers, Vandiver &amp; Dugan, A New Look at Public Opinion On Capital Punishment: What Citizens and Legislators Prefer, 22 Am.

Valtorta of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n        Deputy General Counsel Robert Petersen, of Department of Corrections, and Scott Justice, of Haynesworth, Baldwin, Johnson &amp; Greaves, P.A., both of Columbia; and Vance Drawdy, of Haynsworth, Baldwin, Johnson&amp; Greaves, P.A., of Greenville, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: The trial judge granted respondent's motion for summary judgment. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December 1994, appellant David R. Lawson, a licensed attorney, took a position with respondent South Carolina Department of Corrections (Department) as an Offender Information Representative. Appellant's immediate supervisor was respondent Messim Lee. Respondent Lorraine Fowler was Lee's supervisor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 1995, the Department began seeking candidates for a Records Manager position. Several internal candidates applied for the position and three were given a written test. One candidate, Deborah Castaldi, scored the highest and was hired. Appellant alleges that Lee had told him he had already pre-selected Castaldi. In March 1995, appellant alleges that he heard Castaldi tell co-workers that she had been allowed to consult reference materials while taking the test. Appellant wrote a memo to a supervisor in the Department outlining his concerns over Castaldi's hiring. At about this same time, appellant allegedly informed the Department that the release dates of several prisoners had been miscalculated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 1995, Fowler told appellant that his employment was being terminated. Appellant brought this action alleging violations of the Whistleblower statute against Department, conspiracy against Lee and Fowler, and retaliation/wrongful discharge and violations of privacy rights against all respondents. The trial court granted Department's motion for summary judgment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in granting Department summary judgment?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank of South Carolina v. Lanford, 313 S.C. 540, 443 S.E.2d 549 (1994). Summary judgment should not be granted when inquiry into the facts is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Hook v. Rothstein, 275 S.C. 187, 268 S.E.2d 288 (1980).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na) Wrongful Discharge Cause of Action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in granting Department summary judgment on his wrongful discharge cause of action. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized the doctrine of employment at-will. Culler v. Blue Ride Elec. Cook Inc, 309 S.C. 243, 422 S.E.2d 91(1992); Ludwick v. This Minute of Carolina Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d 213 (1985). In Ludwick, we adopted a public policy exception to the employment at-will doctrine and held: \"Where the retaliatory discharge of an at-will employee constitutes violation of a clear mandate of public policy, a cause of action in tort for wrongful discharge arises.\" Id. at 225, 337 S.E.2d at 216. This public policy exception clearly applies in cases when an employer requires an employee to violate the law or the reason for the employee's termination was itself a violation of criminal law. Garner v. Morrison Knudsen Corp., 318 S.C. 223, 456 S.E.2d 907 (1995). This is not the case here. Appellant was not asked to violate the law and his termination did not violate criminal law. Thus, these allegations do not support a wrongful discharge action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, when a statute creates a substantive right (i.e. the Whistleblower statute) and provides a remedy for infringement of that right, the plaintiff is limited to that statutory remedy. Campbell v. Bi-Lo, 301 S.C. 448, 392 S.E.2d 477 (Ct.App.1190). Since appellant alleges a wrongful discharge only on the ground of his whistleblowing, he is limited to his remedy under the Whistleblower Act. Dockins v. Ingles Markets Inc., 306 S.C. 496,413 S.E.2d 18, 19 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Whistleblower Cause of Action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in granting Department summary judgment on his Whistleblower cause of action. We disagree. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-27-2d(A)(Supp. 1999) provides that \"no public body may dismiss, suspend from employment, demote, or decrease the compensation of an employee of a public body because the employee files a report with an appropriate authority of wrongdoing.\" A \"report\" is defined as \"a written document alleging waste or wrongdoing that contains the following information: (a) the date of disclosure; (b) the name of the employee making the report; and (c) the nature of the wrongdoing and the date or range of dates on which the wrongdoing allegedly occurred.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§8-27-10(4) (Supp. 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, appellant filed an affidavit with John Near, the Department's Personnel Administrator, on March 30, 1995, describing the details of Castaldi's hiring. On that same day, respondent Lee sent a memo to appellant expressing concern over appellant's work and attitude. Near responded to appellant's affidavit on April 7th stating that he had asked respondent Fowler to review the allegations. Near stated that respondent Fowler reviewed the situation and met with respondent Lee. Respondent Fowler then informed Near that there had been a misunderstanding. Near concluded that no state policies had been violated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his complaint, appellant alleged Department had wrongfully terminated him because he reported violations of policy in regards to the hiring of Castaldi. Appellant, however, has never pointed to any provision or policy which would prevent a potential employee from using reference materials. Since appellant has not pointed to any policy, ethics rule, or other regulation which he claims as 'a basis for his Whistleblower action, the trial judge correctly granted summary judgment. Furthermore, the evidence indicates another candidate who took the test did not use any reference materials but that she never asked to use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, appellant also refers to problems in the Department regarding miscalculating prisoners' release dates. However, he did not allege in his complaint that Department had terminated him because he had reported miscalculations of prisoners' sentences. Even if appellant made such allegations in his complaint, he never filed a report with an appropriate authority concerning the miscalculations as required by the Whistleblower Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc) Conspiracy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in granting Department summary judgment on his conspiracy cause of action. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons joining for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and causing special damage to the plaintiff.\" LaMotte v. Punch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 370 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1988). Because no special damages are alleged, the trial court correctly granted Department summary judgment on the conspiracy cause of action. Vaught v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201, 387 S.E.2d 91 (Ct.App. 1989).

We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1997, appellant pled guilty to murder and armed robbery and was sentenced to thirty years for each to run consecutively. The crimes were committed on January 18, 1996, when appellant was sixteen years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court have jurisdiction to accept appellant's guilty plea?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the circuit court was without jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version of S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-7-430 1in effect when appellant committed the offenses provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  If, during the pendency of a criminal or quasi-criminal charge against a child in a circuit court of this State, it is ascertained that the child was under the age of seventeen years at the time of committing the alleged offense, it is the duty of the circuit court immediately to transfer the case, together with all the papers, documents and testimony connected with it; to the family court of competent jurisdiction; except in those cases where the Constitution gives to the circuit court exclusive jurisdiction or in those cases where jurisdiction has properly been transferred to the circuit court by the family court under the provisions of this section ....\r\n\r\nAlso effective in January 1995, the definition of \"child\" was set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-7-390 2 which provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  When used in this article, unless the context otherwise requires, \"child\" means a person less than seventeen years of age, where the child is dealt with as a juvenile delinquent. \"Child\" does not mean a person sixteen years of age or older who is charged with a Class A, B, C, or D felony as defined in Section 16-1-20 or a felony which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years or more. However, a person sixteen years of age who is charged with a Class A, B, C, or D felony as defined in Section 16-1-20 or a felony which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years or more may be remanded to the family court for disposition of the charge at the discretion of the solicitor.\r\n\r\nClass A, B, C, and D felonies include, among other offenses, armed robbery. Murder has a maximum sentence greater than fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family court is a statutory court created by the legislature and, therefore, is of limited jurisdiction. Its jurisdiction is limited to that expressly or by necessary implication conferred by statute. The jurisdictional authority of the court is set forth in the Children's Code. South Carolina Dept. of Mental Health v. State, 301 S.C. 75, 390 S.E.2d 185 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen appellant pled guilty in 1996, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-400 (A) provided that: \"Except as otherwise provided herein, the [family] court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction and shall be the sole court for initiating action: (1) Concerning any child living or found within the geographical limits of its jurisdiction . . . (d) Who is alleged to have violated or attempted to violate any state or local law or municipal ordinance, regardless of where the violation occurred . . . (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe definition of \"child\" in Â§ 20-7-390, however, excludes those persons sixteen years of age who are charged with Class A, B, C, or D felonies or felonies punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years or more. Accordingly, these sixteen year olds (who ordinarily are considered juveniles or children under the above statutes) can be charged in circuit court without first bringing the charges in family court and obtaining transfers. This is strictly limited to sixteen year olds who are charged with committing the specified offenses. Charges against juveniles under 16 and charges against sixteen year olds which are not one of the specified felonies must begin in family court and may be transferred under some circumstances. See, e.g., State v. Corey, Op. No. 25077 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 6, 2000)(murder charge involving 12-year old defendant can be transferred from family court to circuit court). Accordingly, the circuit court had jurisdiction to accept appellant's plea as appellant was 16 when the offenses were committed and murder and armed robbery are within the above specified felonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Section 20-7-430 was repealed effective July 1, 1996. 1996 S.C.

Chastain,  Respondent.\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25123Heard April 6, 2000 - Filed May 15, 2000\r\n\r\nNO ADDITIONAL SANCTION\r\n\r\nA. Camden Lewis and Mark W. Hardee of Lewis, Babcock &amp; Hawkins, L.L.P., of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSenior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney grievance matter, we must decide whether to sanction Randall M. Chastain (Respondent) following his conviction in a criminal case that involved a matter for which we had sanctioned Respondent in a prior disciplinary proceeding. We choose not to impose an additional sanction in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSix years ago, this Court found that Respondent committed misconduct in nine cases by neglecting legal matters, failing to respond to clients' telephone calls and letters, failing to return unused retainer fees, and failing to respond to inquiries by disciplinary authorities. The Court imposed a two-year definite suspension on Respondent and ordered him to pay $30,790 in restitution to his clients before applying for readmission to the Bar. Matter of Chastain, 316 S.C. 438, 450 S.E.2d 578 (1994).1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe misconduct relating to the retainer fees included a $5,000 retainer paid by client David Farmer and a $3,500 retainer paid by client Hoyt M. Housand, Jr. Id. In September 1995, a Richland County grand jury indicted Respondent on two counts of breach of trust with fraudulent intent in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-230 (Supp. 1999). The charges arose out of the retainers he failed to return to Farmer and Housand. A jury found Respondent guilty of the charge involving Farmer. Respondent was sentenced in February 1998 to eighteen months in prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July 1998, an investigative panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission) instituted formal charges against Respondent. The formal charges alleged that Respondent's breach of trust conviction in the Farmer case constituted misconduct under Rule 7(a) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent moved to dismiss the charges. After a hearing, a subpanel recommended in November 1998 that Respondent's motion be denied. The subpanel found Respondent's conviction to be a ground for discipline in Rule 7(a), RLDE, but recommended that no additional sanction be imposed because Respondent already had been sanctioned by the Court for the misconduct at issue, i.e., the failure to return Farmer's money. The full panel adopted the subpanel's report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December 1998, Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., representing the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (disciplinary counsel), agreed with the panel's finding of misconduct but objected to its decision not to impose any additional sanction on Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  May a lawyer who has been sanctioned for improperly failing to return a retainer be sanctioned a second time after he is convicted of a criminal charge stemming from his failure to return that same retainer?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent concedes he may be disciplined by the Court for failing to return the retainer and then criminally prosecuted in that same case. However, Respondent argues it would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause and be unfair to sanction him a second time for failing to return Farmer's retainer after he was criminally convicted in the matter. The conviction was simply additional evidence of misconduct that, if it had been obtained earlier, could have been admitted as evidence against Respondent in the original disciplinary proceeding, he argues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisciplinary counsel contends that double jeopardy is not implicated because a disciplinary matter is a civil proceeding, not a criminal proceeding. Respondent's conviction is sanctionable misconduct under Rule 7.4(a)(4), RLDE, and Rule 8.4(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) contained in Rule 407, SCACR.2 Disciplinary counsel asserts it is proper for Commission to recommend an additional sanction because the conviction itself is a separate basis for sanction under the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will first address the double jeopardy issue, then discuss the propriety of an additional sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. DOUBLE JEOPARDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \"[n]o person shall . . . be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\" The South Carolina constitution contains an almost identical provision. S.C. Const. art. I, Â§12 (\"No person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or liberty\"). Although we have held that a disciplinary proceeding is not criminal in nature, see Burns v. Clayton, 237 S.C. 316, 331, 117 S.E.2d 300, 307 (1960), we have not previously addressed whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated when a lawyer is both disciplined and criminally prosecuted for the same misconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Double Jeopardy clause protects against: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense. State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 519 S.E.2d 786 (1999); State v. Price, 333 S.C. 267, 510 S.E.2d 215 (1998); State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997); State v. Owens, 309 S.C. 402, 424 S.E.2d 473 (1992). However, the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated only in criminal proceedings. Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93,103-05,118 S.Ct. 488, 495-96,139 L.Ed.2d 450, 461 63 (1997) (holding that double jeopardy did not prohibit criminal prosecution for conspiracy and violation of banking laws where federal regulatory agency had imposed money penalties and debarment in prior civil administrative proceeding); Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 398-405, 58 S.Ct. 630, 633-36, 82 L.Ed. 917, 921-25 (1938) (holding that double jeopardy did not prohibit government from imposing a civil assessment against an individual in a tax fraud case where the individual had been acquitted of fraud in a prior criminal case based on same allegations).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome courts describe disciplinary proceedings against a lawyer as civil in nature. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has explained that\r\n\r\n  [d]isciplinary proceedings are civil in nature. Disciplinary proceedings do not constitute a second \"trial,\" nor is the sanction which may be imposed a secondary penalty or punishment. Rather, the primary purpose of a disciplinary proceeding is the ascertainment of moral fitness and professional competency of the attorney, and a determination of whether it is necessary for the protection of the public interest that the attorney be disciplined, suspended, or disbarred. These are public interests not addressed by the underlying criminal proceeding. Whatever ancillary punitive effects might be said to attach in a practical sense to an attorney's civil disciplinary proceeding do not violate the state constitutional proscription against being put twice in jeopardy of \"punishment\" for the same \"offense.\"\r\n\r\nMatter of Rabideau, 306 N.W.2d 1, 6-7 (Wis. 1981) (citations omitted); see also Matter of Discipline of Babilis, 951 P.2d 207, 214 (Utah 1997) (disciplinary proceedings are civil in nature and do not involve a criminal penalty; goal is to maintain the honesty, integrity and professionalism of the Bar).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome courts describe disciplinary proceedings as quasi-criminal in nature because the lawyer has certain procedural and substantive rights to ensure due process. See In Re Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 550-51, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 1226, 20 L.Ed.2d 117,121-23 (1968); Mississippi State Bar v. Young, 509 So. 2d 210, 212 (Miss. 1987); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Campbell, 345 A.2d 616, 620 (Pa. 1975).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther courts describe disciplinary matters as special proceedings that constitute a class unto themselves because they do not fall squarely into either the civil or criminal categories. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  it would be well to note that disbarment and suspension proceedings are neither civil nor criminal in nature but are special proceedings, sui generis, and result from the inherent power of courts over their officers. Such proceedings are not lawsuits between parties litigant but rather are in the nature of an inquest or inquiry as to the conduct of the respondent.\r\n  They are not for the purpose of punishment, but rather seek to determine the fitness of an officer of the court to continue in that capacity and to protect the courts and the public from the official ministration of persons unfit to practice. Thus the real question at issue in a disbarment proceeding is the public interest and an attorney's right to continue to practice a profession imbued with public trust.\r\n\r\nIn Re Echeles, 430 F.2d 347, 349-50 (7th Cir. 1970); see also Fitzsimmons v. State Bar, 667 P.2d 700, 703 (Cal. 1983) (attorneys subject to disciplinary proceedings are not afforded all procedural safeguards which are extended to criminal defendants because such proceedings are sui generis as opposed to purely civil or criminal in character); Campbell, 345 A.2d at 619-20 (describing disciplinary proceedings as special proceedings as well as quasi-criminal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegardless of the exact label applied, courts uniformly have concluded that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated in disciplinary proceedings. See, e.g., Matter of Caranchini, 160 F.3d 420, 423 (8th Cir. 1998) (while disbarment may be considered punishment in common parlance, attorney discipline, including disbarment and other sanctions, are not punishment for purposes of Double Jeopardy Clause); Young, 509 So. 2d at 214 n. l (\"Most states which have addressed the matter have held that disciplinary proceedings are not so criminal in nature as to evoke double jeopardy protections.\"); In re Brown, 906 P.2d 1184,1191 (Cal. 1995) (disciplinary action does not take the form of traditional criminal sanctions, such as monetary fines or incarceration, but rather consists of reproval, suspension from the practice of law, or disbarment; thus, double jeopardy did not bar disciplinary action that followed lawyer's nolo contendere plea in criminal case); People v. Marmon, 903 P.2d 651, 655 (Colo. 1995) (en banc) (disciplinary sanction is not punishment for double jeopardy purposes; court noted that a contrary conclusion would lead to absurd result that lawyers convicted of criminal offenses could never be disciplined); Matter of McDaniel, 470 N.E.2d 1327, 1328 (Ind. 1984) (double jeopardy does not prohibit review of charges of misconduct in disciplinary proceeding even though the lawyer may have been found not guilty of the charges in a criminal proceeding).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPunishment or deterrence sometimes is an aspect of various types of civil proceedings against an individual, but the mere presence of such a purpose usually is not sufficient to render a sanction criminal. Hudson, 522 U.S. at 105, 118 S.Ct. at 496, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 at 463; see also Price, 333 S.C. at 270-74, 510 S.E.2d at 217-19 (explaining analysis under Hudson and holding that administrative suspension of driver's license for refusal to submit to breathalyser test is not so punitive in purpose or effect as to constitute a criminal penalty that would implicate double jeopardy).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourts have identified several purposes of lawyer discipline proceedings. The primary purpose, and by far the one most often identified, \"is to protect the public and the administration of justice from lawyers who have not discharged, will not discharge, or are unlikely properly to discharge their professional duties to clients, the public, the legal system, and the legal profession.\" American Bar Association, Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Â§1.1(1991). We have similarly explained that the \"central purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from unscrupulous and indifferent lawyers.\" Matter of Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisciplinary proceedings also protect the integrity of the legal system, deter unethical conduct among all lawyers, and where appropriate, rehabilitate the lawyer. \"[W]hile sanctions imposed on a lawyer obviously have a punitive aspect, nonetheless, it is not the purpose to impose such sanctions for punishment.\" Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Â§1.1 &amp; commentary; accord Theard v. United States, 354 U.S. 278, 281, 77 S.Ct. 1274, 1276, 1 L.Ed.2d 1342,1345 (1957) (\"power of disbarment is necessary for the protection of the public\"); Caranchini, 160 F.3d at 424 (attorney discipline is designed to protect the public); Brown, 906 P.2d at 1191 (aim in disciplining lawyers is not punishment or retribution, but is meant to protect public, promote confidence in legal system, and maintain high professional standards); Marmon, 903 P.2d at 655 (\"where the respondent has already been punished by the criminal justice system, our aim in determining the level of discipline is not retribution, but the protection of the public\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, we hold that Respondent plainly is not afforded any protection under the Double Jeopardy Clause because disciplinary proceedings, whether classified as civil, quasi-criminal, or special, are not criminal in nature. The purpose of such proceedings is not to punish the lawyer, but to protect the public and the integrity of the legal system. Accordingly, double jeopardy does not prohibit us from imposing an additional sanction against Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. PROPRIETY OF ADDITIONAL SANCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving decided the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated, we next must decide whether Respondent's criminal conviction provides a basis for an additional sanction and, if so, whether such a sanction would be appropriate in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well established that a disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Matter of Yarborough, 327 S.C. 161, 488 S.E.2d 871(1997). While we are not bound by the findings of the subpanel and full panel, their findings are entitled to great weight, particularly when the inferences to be drawn from the testimony depend on the credibility of witnesses. Id. We may make our own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and we are riot bound by the panel's recommendation. Burns v. Clayton on, 237 S.C. 316,117 S.E.2d 300 (1960). We must administer the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record. Matter of Kirven, 267 S.C. 669, 230 S.E.2d 899 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties have not cited and we have not found any similar case in South Carolina or elsewhere, an indication of the unusual nature of this case. We hold that Respondent's criminal conviction, which followed a disciplinary proceeding in which he was sanctioned, provides a separate basis for an additional sanction. See Rule 7.4(a)(4), RLDE, and Rule 8.4(b), RPC. \r\nWe do not believe, however, that an additional sanction is inevitable in every case such as Respondent's. We will analyze each case individually in deciding whether to impose an additional sanction. We will consider (1) whether an additional sanction is necessary to protect the public; (2) whether an additional sanction is necessary to protect the integrity of the legal system or the administration of justice; (3) whether the criminal proceeding resulted in any information we did not consider in imposing the prior sanction; (4) whether the convicted lawyer would be unable to practice law due to incarceration, probation, or parole; (5) whether the disciplinary or criminal processes have been improperly manipulated to harass or intimidate the lawyer; (6) whether imposing an additional sanction would be unfair to the lawyer; and (7) any other factor we deem relevant.\r\nIn this case, we choose not to impose an additional sanction on Respondent, who has completed his prison sentence but remains suspended from the practice of law. An additional sanction is not necessary to protect the public, the integrity of the legal system, or the administration of justice. The criminal proceeding revealed no new information about the Farmer matter, and the record reveals no evidence of improper manipulation of either the disciplinary or criminal processes. We find it would be unnecessary and unfair to sanction Respondent a second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that Respondent is not afforded any protection under the Double Jeopardy Clause because disciplinary proceedings, whether classified as civil, quasi-criminal, or special, are not criminal in nature. Although ethical and disciplinary rules provide a separate basis for imposing an additional sanction following a criminal conviction, we find it unnecessary to impose an additional sanction in Respondent's case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO ADDITIONAL SANCTION.\r\n1Respondent has been disciplined twice in other matters since 1994, but none of those are at issue in this case. In 1995, the Court found Respondent in criminal contempt of the 1994 suspension order. Respondent had performed legal research and prepared and reviewed pleadings. Matter of Chastain, S.C. Sup. Ct. Order dated October 6, 1995: In 1997, the Court suspended Respondent for ninety days after he pleaded guilty to willful failure to file a state income tax return in 1989, 1990, and 1993.

The circuit court dismissed certain actions in a lawsuit brought by Osprey, Inc., and Andrew Leheup (\"Plaintiffs\") against Cabana Limited Partnership, Maritime Development Corp., Bluewater Associates, and William J. Reiner (\"Defendants\"). The Court ofAppeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case for further inquiry. Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Limited Partnership, 333 S.C. 323, 509 S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App. 1998), overruled on other grounds by I'On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, Op. No. 25048 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 1). We granted Plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision. We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCabana Limited Partnership was a plaintiff in a lender liability action filed in federal district court in South Carolina against Greyhound Real Estate Financing Co. and others. Two years into the federal case, with litigation expenses surpassing $100,000, Cabana attorney George H. McMaster asked Plaintiffs for a loan to help pay the expenses. McMaster's firm, Tompkins &amp; McMaster, had represented Plaintiffs in other matters. Plaintiffs agreed in March 1993 to lend $50,000 to Defendants Cabana, Maritime, Bluewater, and Reiner. That agreement provided, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The parties acknowledge each to the other that there exists a certain Lawsuit between Cabana Limited Partnership vs. Greyhound Real Estate Finance Company, et al., and that in consideration for the advancement of the funds above, the Fifty Thousand and no/100 ($50,000.00) Dollars, Osprey, Inc. is buying an interest in that said Lawsuit. If said Lawsuit is settled or tried with a verdict in excess of Fifty Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) Dollars, Osprey, Inc. will receive the sum of the amount of the verdict up to a maximum of One Hundred Fifty Thousand and no/100 ($150,000.00) Dollars and the Note will be considered satisfied and paid in full. If the Lawsuit is never settled or if tried and the outcome is not in favor of Cabana Limited Partnership in an amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand and no/100 ($150,000.00) Dollars or more, then the Debtor will remain obligated for the Note [in the] amount of the Settlement or verdict but in no event less than Fifty Thousand and no/100 ($50,000.00) Dollars.\r\n\r\nIn related loan documents, Defendants Bluewater and Cabana signed a promissory note in the amount of $50,000, bearing an annual interest rate of 15 percent, to Plaintiff Osprey; Defendant Reiner personally guaranteed the loan; Reiner assigned all his right and interest in the first $150,000 of gross proceeds from the federal lawsuit to Osprey; and Bluewater assigned its interest in certain timeshare notes and mortgages to Osprey to serve as collateral for the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January 1994, the parties settled the federal case and entered into a sealed settlement agreement. Plaintiffs sought repayment of the loan upon learning of the settlement. Defendants asserted they were prohibited from revealing the terms of the settlement and refused to repay the loan. The federal court ultimately granted Plaintiffs' request to disclose the settlement agreement, and Plaintiffs discovered that Defendants had received $650,000. Tompkins &amp; McMaster was paid $200,000 for attorney's fees and the remainder was placed in escrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe settlement agreement required Greyhound, the defendant in the federal lawsuit, to pay $650,000 directly to Tompkins &amp; McMaster as compensation for legal services in five related cases, including Cabana's. The agreement prohibited any payment to Cabana, and required Tompkins &amp; McMaster to hold $450,000 in escrow pending the resolution of tax levies filed against Cabana by the Internal Revenue Service. Tompkins &amp; McMaster v. United States, No. 95-1882,1996 WL 389483,1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 17118 (4th Cir. July 12, 1996) (unpublished opinion).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTompkins &amp; McMaster filed a federal lawsuit to clarify its rights to the $450,000. The firm argued that no tax levy attached to the proceeds because Cabana received nothing from the settlement and had no right to legal fees received by the firm. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the district court's dismissal of the case, rejected Tompkins &amp; McMaster's argument. Although the money was not paid directly to Cabana, it was paid to the firm on Cabana's behalf and for its benefit. Thus, the $650,000 represented Cabana's proceeds from the federal litigation. Tompkins &amp; McMaster, supra. Defendants assert the IRS matter has since been resolved in favor of Greyhound and Tompkins &amp; McMaster, and against the IRS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs filed suit in state court to enforce the loan agreement. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, because the agreement was champertous on its face and consequently unenforceable. The circuit judge granted Defendants' motion to dismiss as champertous the causes of action for breach of contract, breach of contract of assignment, and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs appealed. Reviewing the matter as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 12(c), SCRCP, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit judge's ruling that South Carolina recognizes the doctrine of champerty. However, the Court of Appeals reversed the judge's ruling that the loan agreement is champertous as a matter of law. The Court of Appeals limited the doctrine of champerty, then remanded the case for further inquiry into the facts to determine whether the agreement is enforceable. Osprey, 333 S. C. 323, S.E.2d 275.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Does South Carolina recognize the common law doctrine of champerty and, if so, does it remain a viable defense to the enforcement of the loan agreement in this case?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case raises a novel question of law. We are free to decide a question of law with no particular deference to the lower court. See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§5 and 9; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp.1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 1999) (granting Supreme Court and Court of Appeals the jurisdiction to correct errors of law in both law and equity actions); I'On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, Op. No. 25048 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs contend the Court of Appeals erred in holding that South Carolina recognizes the doctrine of champerty. They assert that champerty is not and should not be recognized because it is rooted in feudal England. It is an outdated concept no longer needed in twenty-first century America, Plaintiffs argue. They urge the Court to refuse to recognize champerty and enforce the entire agreement as it was written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendants assert the Court has long recognized champerty, should continue to recognize it, and should apply it in this case to nullify the entire loan agreement - including the $50,000 note and guarantee - because it is champertous as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that this Court previously has recognized the common law doctrine of champerty. Osprey, 333 S.C. at 329-30, 509 S.E.2d at 277 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-1-50 (1977), which provides that \"[a]ll, and every part, of the common law of England, where it is not altered by the Code or inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of this State, is hereby continued in full force and effect in the same manner as before the adoption of this section\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChamperty is defined as a bargain by a person with a plaintiff or a defendant for a portion of the matter involved in a suit in the event of a successful termination of the action, which the person undertakes to maintain or carry on at his own expense. State v. Chitty, 17 S.C. Law (1 Bail.) 379, 400 (1830); 14 C.J.S. Champerty and Maintenance Â§2 (1991); 14 Am.Jur.2d Champerty and Maintenance Â§ 3 (1964). A champertor is one who purchases an interest in the outcome of a case in which he has no interest otherwise. A champertous agreement is unlawful and void where the rule of champerty is recognized, and the tainted agreement is unenforceable. 14 C.J.S. Champerty and Maintenance Â§17; 14 Am.Jur.2d Champerty and Maintenance Â§ 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarratry (or barretry) is the offense of frequently exciting and stirring up quarrels and suits between other individuals. Chitty, supra; 14 C.J.S. Champerty and Maintenance Â§ 2; Black's Law Dictionary 150 (1990). Champerty and barratry have been described as forms of maintenance, which is defined as \"an officious intermeddling in a suit that in no way belongs to one, by maintaining or assisting either party. with money or otherwise, to prosecute or defend [the suit].\" 14 C.J.S. Champerty and Maintenance Â§ 2(b); 14 Am.Jur.2d Champerty and Maintenance Â§ 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs explained by the United States Supreme Court, \"[p]ut simply, maintenance is helping another prosecute a suit; champerty is maintaining a suit in return for a financial interest in the outcome; and barratry is a continuing practice of maintenance or champerty.\" In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412, 424 n.15, 98 S.Ct. 1893, 1900 n.15, 56 L.Ed.2d 417, 429 n.15 (1978). \"The laws against champerty, maintenance, and barratry are aimed at the prevention of multitudinous and useless lawsuits and at the prevention of speculation in lawsuits.\" 14 C.J.S. Champerty and Maintenance Â§ 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origins of the doctrine of champerty are found in medieval England.2Claims and rights in those days were not freely assignable. Under English common law, the public policy originally was so strongly opposed to champerty and maintenance that assignments of a cause of action, so as to give the assignee any right to bring suit in his own name, generally were forbidden. Noland v. Law, 170 S.C. 345, 353, 170 S.E. 439, 442 (1933). \"[T]he offense of maintenance was a broad one . . . and was so abhorred that it formed one basis for the prohibition against assigning choses in action\" until the nineteenth century. Son v. Margolius, 709 A.2d 112, 120 (Md. 1998) (quoting 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo overcome such impediments, wealthy people obtained interests in legal claims, agreeing to pay the litigant's expenses in exchange for a share of the results if successful. Such claims often involved title to land, which meant that a person with capital could grow richer by becoming a joint owner of a landed estate. Champertors, both the wealthy and those desiring to become wealthy, financed the claims of the others, often the poor and the dispossessed, against people upon whom the champertors sought to inflict financial or political injury. Feudal magnates had numerous retainers, including professional maintainers, who brought suits financed by the magnate. Those maintainers took all necessary steps to win, including the employment of bullies to prevent an opponent from appearing in court at a critical moment. Champerty was a \"means by which powerful men aggrandized their estates and the background was unquestionably that of private war.\" Max Radin, Maintenance by Champerty, 24 Cal. L. Rev. 48, 58-64 (1935); see also Percy H. Winfield, The History of Maintenance and Champerty, 35 Law Quarterly R. 50, 57-68 (1919); R.D. Cox, Champerty As We Know It, 13 Memphis St. U. L. R. 139, 143-60 (1983).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither secular nor clerical medieval courts were able to prevent or police such agreements. Collusion among the landed gentry, sheriffs, judicial officials, and the king's ministers to obtain money and land through the maintenance of a stranger's lawsuit was rampant in medieval England. Radin, supra; Winfield, supra; Cox, supra. King after king tried to eradicate the practice, but never wholly succeeded because those who were called upon to enforce the law often were the worst offenders. Winfield, supra, at 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal historians view champerty as a final \"flaring up\" of the feudal era, a last-ditch effort of feudal lords to combat the limits and framework of the monarchy. It embodied a resistance of the moneyed class to capitalistic forces that had begun to take root across Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Radin, supra, at 64-66.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEfforts to prevent champerty and maintenance were grounded in several concerns: the king's desire to prevent litigation involving his own interests or those of his supporters; clerical opposition to litigation generally, especially in secular courts; a general dislike of usury, or the practice of loaning money at interest; and the belief that litigation was, in itself, an undesirable and distasteful-affair, regardless of the merits of a lawsuit. Radin, supra, 60-67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith that background, this Court's strong language and unequivocal condemnation of champerty evident in State v. Chitty, supra, is understandable. In Chitty, the defendant magistrate, an attorney, was found guilty of the crime of barratry. The magistrate constantly urged people to swear out warrants and cross-warrants in order to generate additional fees for himself. In affirming the conviction, the majority stated that some authorities suggest \r\n\r\n  that if a man lay out money, in behalf of another in suits at law to recover a just right, he is not a barretor, and that he may do this in respect of the poverty of the party. Some subsequent writers also, losing sight of the reason of the rule, have laid it down, generally, that it was not barretry to spend money in promoting the suit of another to recover a just right. But . . . in the case referred to, it is expressly laid down, that if one lend money to promote and stir up suits, he is a barretor. . .\r\n  The busybody, the deceiver, the vile knave, or unthrift, who excites others to litigation, with an intention to vex, and oppress, and by this means extort money, is . . . an offender against public justice.\r\n  Maintenance, it seems, is a species of barretry; and champerty, and conspiracy belong to the same class of offences, and yet it never entered into the mind of any man, that he who unlawfully maintained a suit, bargained to divide the field, or conspired with others, was less a maintainer, champertor, or conspirator, because the cause was just [and not rooted in a selfish or oppressive motive] . . . . The temple erected and consecrated to Justice is not, however, to be polluted with impunity, by those who would prostitute the rules regulating its police to base and unworthy purposes...\r\n  The pursuit of right, whether public or private, can never be an offence; where justice alone is the end in view; but every perversion of the machinery of the law to other purposes, by coupling it with improper objects, is reprehensible. Hence if one lay out money in the prosecution of a suit to recover a close, of which his poor neighbor has been deprived, and without which he must lose it, he is no champertor, because, right, humanity, and justice would approve it: but if he do it upon a stipulation, that he shall receive one half of the field, if it be recovered, he is, according to the legal definition of this offence, a champertor.\r\n\r\nChitty,17 S.C., Law (1 Bail.) at 399-401. The Chitty court, then, plainly believed champerty was a perverse practice that should be eradicated as a matter of public policy, regardless of whether the champertor's motive is to see justice done or merely financial gain for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have found only two cases other than Chitty which reveal much about this Court's past view of champerty. In Cooke v. Pool, 25 S.C. 593 (1886), the Court rejected a champerty argument. The Court appeared much less disturbed by signs of champerty than the Chitty court had been fifty-six years earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Cooke, a plaintiff who obtained a default judgment assigned it to attorney Thompson Cooke for $100. Thompson Cooke, who was not an interested party in the litigation that resulted in the default judgment, then assigned the judgment to his brother, Henry Cooke, in payment of a debt. The defendants asserted Henry could not enforce the judgment because the original assignment of the judgment to Thompson was champertous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cooke court disagreed. The Court concluded that, although Thompson probably could not have sought to enforce the judgment because the transfer to him was champertous and in violation of a statute, Thompson's assignment to brother Henry was not void for champerty. The Court found that the record supported the lower court's finding that Henry was a bonafide holder of a regular and valid assignment who had no notice of the tainted title.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court appeared similarly unfazed by medieval notions of champerty when it found an English statute enacted by Henry VIII, which was intended to prevent champertous conveyances, inapplicable in South Carolina. Poyas v. Wilkins, 46 S.C.L. (12 Rich.) 420, 428 (1860) (a conveyance of land by one out of possession is not void for champerty).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals remanded the matter for further inquiry into whether \"Plaintiffs, in lending the Defendants money for litigation expenses, engaged in officious intermeddling with the intention to stir up strife or otherwise unnecessarily prolong a lawsuit.\" Osprey, 333 S.C. at 330-31, 509 S.E.2d at 279.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals relied on three cases from other jurisdictions. In two of those, it appears the court rejected the champerty argument because the alleged champertor was not really a champertor at all under a modern view of the assignability of rights, but actually had a legitimate interest in the action. See Temeron, Inc. v. Ferraro Energy Corp., 861 P.2d 319, 325-26 (Okla Ct. App. 1993) (alleged champertor had the right, under a consulting contract it signed with gas supplier to review supplier's records, to bring suit on supplier's behalf to recover underpayments and retain percentage of proceeds; court reversed summary judgment for defendant on grounds of champerty, recognizing the alleged champertor had a legitimate interest in the matter); Giambattista v. Nat'l Bank of Commerce of Seattle, 586 P.2d 1180, 1186-88 (Wash. Ct. App. 1978) (alleged champertor was a money broker who agreed to pay litigation expenses for its client depositors whose certified checks were not handled properly by a bank; court reversed grant of summary judgment for defendant on grounds of champerty, recognizing the alleged champertor had a legitimate interest in the matter); see also cases cited in footnote 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA third case cited by the Court of Appeals is quite similar to the present case. In Kraft v. Mason, 668 So.2d 679 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996), a sister loaned her brother $100,000 to pay litigation expenses in an ongoing antitrust lawsuit. The loan agreement called for the sister to receive interest on the loan, plus a declining percentage of any settlement or judgment obtained. After the case settled for more than $5 million, the brother reneged on the deal because of an unrelated family dispute with his sister. He refused to pay some $355,000 he owed her under the agreement. Id. at 681-83.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kraft court rejected the brother's champerty defense. The court reasoned that times have changed since the medieval era when champerty was strongly disfavored. The court held that officious intermeddling was a necessary element of proving a champerty defense, and found no such intermeddling. The trial court correctly had rejected the champerty argument because the sister had simply loaned her brother money to continue an ongoing case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, under Kraft and our Court of Appeals' opinion in this case, an agreement is void for champerty when the champertor is a \"stranger\" to the lawsuit with no legitimate interest in it; the champertor provides money to litigate the suit; the champertor is entitled by the agreement to share in the proceeds of the suit; and the champertor is an officious intermeddler who intended to stir up strife or unnecessarily prolong the suit. Officious intermeddling occurs when the champertor offers unnecessary and unwanted advice or services, especially in a highhanded or overbearing way. Osprey, 333 S.C. at 330-31, 509 S.E.2d at 279.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome observers have asserted the doctrine of champerty ought to be limited in such a manner, and urge courts to avoid linking champerty today to the champerty of medieval times. \"Under all circumstances, it would be well to omit all attempts to connect [champerty] with the medieval offenses which had a rationale of their own, and deal with it as a modern phenomenon to be judged by modern standards and in relation to existing conditions.\" Radin, supra, at 66. Instead of voiding agreements that appear champertous as a matter of law, courts should scrutinize the agreement and the surrounding circumstances to determine whether to enforce the agreement. Such scrutiny \"will substitute judgment by reality for judgment by category.\" Id. at 78.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourts following this view typically reason that \"[i]t sometimes may be useful and convenient, when one has a just demand which he is not able from poverty to enforce, that a more fortunate friend should assist him, and wait for his compensation until the suit is determined, and be paid out of the fruits of it.\" Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Fuller, 23 A. 193, 196 (Conn. 1891); see also Richardson v. Rowland, 40 Conn. 565 (Conn. 1873) (applying law of New York to reject champerty defense and allow plaintiff who helped defendant resolve a mortgage dispute recover half of proceeds of settlement; opinion lists cases illustrating states were evenly split in nineteenth century on validity of champertous agreements); Ari Dobner, Litigation for Sale, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1529,1543-55 (1996) (discussing modern view of champerty in various states and explaining that, although states take different approaches, most seek to limit evils traditionally associated with champerty - frivolous lawsuits or speculation in groundless suits).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently eschewed medieval concepts of champerty, choosing instead to rely on other well-developed principles of law to prevent evils traditionally associated with champertous agreements. In Saladini v. Righellis, 687 N.E.2d 1224 (Mass. 1997), Saladini advanced litigation expenses to Righellis to enable him to pursue his claims in a real estate dispute. In return, Saladini would receive half of any net recovery, after payment of attorney's fees. Saladini, who had no other interest in the real estate dispute, paid some $19,000 in expenses on Righellis' behalf. Righellis settled the suit for $130,000, but did not tell Saladini. When Saladini learned of the settlement, she brought an action to enforce the agreement. Righellis asserted the agreement was champertous and thus unenforceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Saladini court disagreed, and abolished the doctrines of champerty, barratry, and maintenance after reviewing their \"checkered history\" in Massachusetts and elsewhere. The court explained that causes of action and contract rights are freely assignable today, unlike in medieval times. More importantly, \"the decline of champerty, maintenance, and barratry as offences is symptomatic of a fundamental change in society's view of litigation - from a social ill, which, like other disputes and quarrels, should be minimized to a socially useful way to resolve disputes.\" Id. at 1226 (internal quotes omitted). The court no longer was persuaded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  that the champerty doctrine is needed to protect against the evils once feared: speculation in lawsuits, the bringing of frivolous lawsuits, or financial overreaching by a party of superior bargaining position . . . . To the extent that we continue to have the concerns that the doctrine of champerty was thought to address, we conclude that it is better to do so directly, rather than attempting to mold an ancient doctrine to modern circumstances. As Justice Holmes . . . said a century ago: \"It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\"\r\n  \r\n\r\nSaladini, 687 N.E.2d at 1226-27. (quoting O.W. Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (Jan. 8, 1897)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find persuasive the reasoning of our own Court of Appeals and the Saladini and Kraft courts. However, instead of limiting the doctrine of champerty as the Court of Appeals did, we abolish champerty as a defense. We are convinced that other well-developed principles of law can more effectively accomplish the goals of preventing speculation in groundless lawsuits and the filing of frivolous suits than dated notions of champerty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, a lawyer is prohibited from prosecuting a frivolous lawsuit and may face various sanctions if he or she files frivolous pleadings. See Rule 3.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) contained in Rule 407, SCACR (\"A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\"); Rule 11, SCRCP (allowing sanctions against attorney if there is no good ground to support a pleading or if it is interposed for delay). A litigant forced to endure a frivolous lawsuit has a statutory remedy in the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-36-10 to -50 (Supp. 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the doctrines of unconscionability, duress, and good faith establish standards of fair dealing between opposing parties. E.g., U.S. for Use and Benefit of Williams Elec. Co. v. Metric Constructors, Inc., 325 S.C. 129, 480 S.E.2d 447 (1997) (\" [e]very contract contains implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing\"); Fanning v. Fritz's Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick, Inc., 322 S.C. 399, 472 S.E.2d 242 (1996) (discussing unconscionability). In addition, the Legislature has defined barratry, i.e., the promotion or exciting of groundless judicial proceedings, as a misdemeanor offense. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-17-10 &amp; 16-1-100(B) (1985 &amp; Supp. 1999) (defining offense of barratry); S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-17-50 (1985) (statutory barratry provisions are cumulative and not intended to repeal any common law provisions regarding barratry).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur abolition of champerty as a defense does not mean that all such agreements are enforceable as written. When an agreement to finance a lawsuit is challenged, the court must \"consider whether the fees charged are excessive or whether any recovery by a prevailing party is vitiated because of some impermissible overreaching by the financier.\" Saladini, 687 N.E:2d at 1227. The court must be guided by an analysis of what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court may examine (1) whether the respective bargaining position of the parties at the time the agreement was made was relatively equal, (2) whether both parties were aware of the terms and consequences of the agreement, (3) whether the borrowing party may have been unable to pursue the lawsuit at all without the financier's help, (4) whether the financier would retain a disproportionate share of the recovery, and (5) whether the financier engaged in officious intermeddling. See Saladini, 687 N.E.2d at 1227; Osprey, 333 S.C. at 330-31, 509 S.E.2d at 279. A financier becomes an officious intermeddler when he or she offers unwanted advice or otherwise attempts to control the litigation for the purpose of stirring up strife or continuing a frivolous lawsuit. See Smith v. Hartsell, 63 S.E. -172, 174 (N.C. 1908) (stating it has come to be generally accepted that an agreement will not be condemned as champertous unless'-the interference is clearly officious and for the purpose of stirring up strife and continuing litigation); Osprey, supra; Kraft, supra. After analyzing these factors and any others the court deems relevant, the court may enforce, modify, or set aside the financing agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe note two peripheral matters that we do not address today. First, the case before us involves a financial arrangement between non-lawyers. Various ethical constraints closely control and in many instances prohibit business transactions between a lawyer and his or her client. See Rule 1.8, RPC. In particular, a lawyer may not acquire a proprietary interest in the subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may acquire a lien to secure the lawyer's fees or expenses, and the lawyer may contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case. Rule 1.80), RPC. We do not address whether a lawyer may act as a financier in a case involving a litigant who is not the lawyer's client. See Susan Lorde Martin, Syndicated Lawsuits: Illegal Champerty or New Business Opportunity?, 30 Am. Bus. L.J. 485, 488 (1992) (listing statutes in several states that prohibit attorneys or others connected with the judicial process from engaging in maintenance and champerty).4Second, our decision today neither addresses nor authorizes the syndication of lawsuits, a practice in which a litigant sells shares in his lawsuit to investors. See Martin, supra; Dobner, supra (discussing syndication of lawsuits).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe abolish champerty as a defense because we believe it no longer is required to prevent the evils traditionally associated with the doctrine as it developed in medieval times. Accordingly, we affirm, with the modifications we have outlined, the Court of Appeals' decision to reverse the grant of summary judgment to Defendants. We remand this case to circuit court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the issue may arise again upon remand, we reject Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs have no claim to the $650,000 paid to Defendants' attorneys by Greyhound to settle the federal litigation. Although the money was not paid directly to Cabana, it was paid to the Tompkins &amp; McMaster firm on Cabana's behalf and for its benefit. See Tompkins &amp; McMaster, supra. We have considered Defendants' remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1The circuit judge allowed Plaintiffs' causes of action for breach of contract on the note, breach of contract of guarantee, strict foreclosure, breach of fiduciary duty by the attorneys, and fraud to proceed because they were not barred as champertous. Those actions are still pending below.\r\n\r\n2 One of the first statutes prohibiting champerty was enacted by Edward I in the thirteenth century. It provided that \r\n\r\n  [n]o officer of the King by themselves, nor by other, shall maintain pleas, suits, or matters hanging in the King's courts, for land, tenements, or other things, for to have part or profit thereof by covenant made between them, and he that doth, shall be punished at the King's pleasure. \r\n\r\nPercy H. Winfield, The History of Maintenance and Champerty, 35 Law Quarterly R. 50, 59 (1919).\r\nLegal historians have traced the roots of champerty back to the Greek and Roman civilizations when the predecessors of modern lawyers were required to demonstrate a \"personal connection\" to a litigant before speaking on his behalf. Since ancient times, political allies have joined together to harass their enemies with vexatious litigation. Those who did so were known as \"sycophants\" in ancient Greece, \"calumniators\" in ancient Rome, and \"maintainers\" in medieval England. Max Radin, Maintenance by Champerty, 24 Cal. L. R. 48, 50-53 (1935); Elliott Associates. L.P. v. Banco de la Nacion, 194 F.3d 363, 372 (2d Cir. 1999) (\" [c] ommentators have traced the doctrine of champerty, and its doctrinal near-cousins of maintenance and barratry, back to Greek and Roman law, through the English law of the Middle Ages, and into the statutory or common law of many of the states\").\r\n3The parties discuss several other South Carolina cases. None are particularly helpful or relevant because they involved agreements that were not champertous. In each one, the party defending the agreement as not champertous had a legitimate interest in the litigation. See McSwain v. Davis,\r\n96 S.C. 155, 80 S.E. 87 (1913) (finding that document giving McSwain the right, at McSwain's expense, to take legal action necessary to execute an option contract given by previous landowner was not champertous, apparently because McSwain had an obvious interest in the litigation); Ex parte Hiers, 67 S.C. 108, 45 S.E. 146 (1903) (concluding an assignment by the husband of a lawsuit he initially brought to his wife was not champertous because they were \"still regarded as one in law\"; furthermore, the money which the husband had sought to recover was the wife's inheritance); Fraser &amp; Dill v. Charleston, 13 S.C. 533, 545 (1880) (concluding devisees' assignment to City of Charleston of rights relating to stock issued by the city, after the stock was fraudulently conveyed by the testator's personal representative, was not a champertous agreement; city as a proper assignee had right to take legal action to protect the thing assigned).\r\nChamperty frequently is raised when it really is not an issue at all because an agreement involves a party who, in the modern view, has a valid interest in a lawsuit. See e.g., In re Perrysburg Marketplace Co., 208 B.R. 148 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1997) (prosecution of secured claim against Chapter 11 debtor-mortgagor by mortgagee, which had purchased debtor's loan from Resolution Trust Corporation, did not constitute champerty); Schwartz v. Eliades, 939 P.2d 1034 (Nev. 1997) (agreement between two cab company owners to share litigation expenses and any proceeds in defamation suit, where other owners assigned their interest in the suit to the two, was not champertous because neither owner was a stranger to the lawsuit); Rienhardt v. Kelly, 917 P.2d 963 (N.M. Ct. App. 1996) (agreement by testator's son with residuary beneficiary of testator's will, in which son agreed to pay for beneficiary's litigation costs in suit to dispute validity of agreement between decedent and another for purchase of ranch for nominal amount of money, was not champertous given that son, as heir of testator, had property interest in lawsuit).\r\nAs the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has explained, \"[i]f a party has an interest independent of and prior to the allegedly champertous arrangement, or even the possibility of an interest, in the subject litigated, the agreement to carry on the litigation at his own expense in consideration of having part of the recovery is not champertous and illegal.\" Berman v. Linnane, 679 N.E.2d 174, 177 (Mass. 1997).\r\n4Lawyers who accept cases on a contingency fee basis may appear to be champertors under the traditional meaning of the term. Such lawyers are strangers to the lawsuit who may advance litigation expenses and their services in exchange for a percentage of a successful result. See Radin, supra, at 66-6 7; Dobner, supra, at 1532. Contingency fees generally are viewed favorably in the United States, unlike other countries. American courts do not view such fee agreements as champertous. See 14 C.J.S. Champerty and Maintenance &sect; 11; 14 Am.Jur.2d Champerty and Maintenance &sect; 4; W. Kent Davis, The International View of Attorney Fees in Civil Suits: Why Is the United States the \"Odd Man Out\" in How it Pays its Lawyers?, 16 Ariz. J. Int'1 &amp; Comp. L. 361 (1999) (discussing pros and cons of contingency fees and explaining how they are viewed as champertous in some nations); Robert H. Roether, The Forest for the Trees: Judicial Activism in the Tort Marketplace, 78 Mich. B. J.706 (1999) (explaining positive aspects of contingency fees).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25125","title":"In the Matter of Hensel","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25125","description":"","date":"2000-05-15","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter of Hensel\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n.style2 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINAIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of William H.

Steedley Bogan, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and disciplinary counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to disbarment.1 We accept the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts in the agreement are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReal Estate Closing Matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent conducted real estate closings and has admitted to misconduct in at least ten different client matters involving closings. The facts in the agreement establish a pattern which involved respondent (1) failing to pay off prior mortgages pursuant to a closing; (2) utilizing funds received from one client's matter to pay off obligations related to other clients' closings; (3) issuing checks from his escrow account when there were insufficient funds to cover the checks; and (4) misappropriating escrow funds to pay himself legal fees. In addition, respondent issued several checks from his escrow account for title insurance premiums on April 1, 1999. These checks represented various clients' funds which were used to pay the premiums for other clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEscrow Account Matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA review of respondent's escrow account shows that from January 1998 to July 1999, there were at least thirteen negative balances, twelve overdraft charges, and five fees imposed for insufficient funds. Respondent admits that he moved escrow funds to his operating account and used the funds for payment of office expenses, personal bills, and personal taxes to the Internal Revenue Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbate Matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent's wife (Wife) is also a South Carolina attorney. Wife was appointed as Guardian ad Litem (GAL) for at least three different estate matters in which respondent improperly became involved. In each of these matters, Wife was issued checks representing surplus funds from foreclosure actions associated with the estates. Wife deposited these checks into her escrow account and subsequently issued checks from her account in order to open up separate estate accounts. Wife gave these checks to respondent and asked him to open the estate accounts. Respondent, however, deposited the checks into his operating account and/or his escrow account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWife's father was gravely ill with cancer during this time. When she returned to work following the death of her father, respondent recalls that Wife requested he return the funds she had turned over to him. From his escrow account, respondent issued checks to Wife, as GAL, and these funds were used to open up estate accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was never GAL for these three cases, nor was he formally associated with these cases in any way. Respondent did not tell Wife about his inappropriate handling of the estate funds and indeed deliberately misled his wife about how the funds were being handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior Disciplinary Record\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter respondent pled guilty to one count of failure to make and file a South Carolina Income Tax return, respondent's license to practice law was temporarily suspended, see In the Matter of Hensel, 321 S.C. 552, 471 S.E.2d 145 (1996), and respondent was suspended from the practice of law for ninety days, retroactive to the date of his temporary suspension. In the Matter of Hensel, 334 S.C. 617, 472 S.E.2d 619 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased upon the above facts, respondent admits that his misconduct constitutes a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR. Respondent failed to provide competent representation. Rule 1.1. He failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his clients. Rule 1.3. He violated his duty regarding the safekeeping of his clients' or third parties' property. Rule 1.15. Respondent engaged in conduct that involves deceit and misrepresentation and is prejudicial to the administration of justice. Rule 8.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, respondent breached his duties related to financial recordkeeping. He violated Rule 417, SCACR, by failing to: (1) conduct monthly reconciliations of the escrow account; (2) identify escrow checks by client name or file number; (3) identify escrow account deposit slips by date or client name; and (4) maintain ledgers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent admits he violated Rule 7, RLDE, by violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, by engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bring the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law and by violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, respondent's misconduct warrants disbarment. Accordingly, we hereby disbar respondent, retroactive to September 3, 1999, the date of his interim suspension. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1By Order of this Court dated September 3, 1999, respondent was placed on interim suspension, and Michael H.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to be suspended from the practice of law for ninety days. We accept the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent pled guilty to an indictment charging him with willful failure to make and file a South Carolina Income Tax Return for tax year 1994 in violation of S.C. Code Ann.Â§ 12-54-40(b)(6)(c) (Supp. 1999). Respondent was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $10,000, suspended upon the payment of a fine of $500, plus assessments and a surcharge, payment of restitution, and completion of 350 hours of public service employment. The sentence includes five years of probation which terminates upon the completion of the payments and the public service requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe failure to file a tax return is a serious crime as set forth in Rule 2(z), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. By his conduct, respondent has violated Rule 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and Rule 7(a)(4), RLDE, by committing a serious crime that reflects adversely upon his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer and has violated Rule 7(a)(5) and (6), RLDE, by engaging in conduct tending to bring the courts or legal profession into disrepute and violating the oath of office he took upon admission to the practice of law in this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, respondent's misconduct warrants a definite suspension from the practice of law for ninety days. Accordingly, respondent is suspended for ninety days, retroactive to February 15, 2000, the date of his interim suspension. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25128","title":"In the Matter of Jones","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25128","description":"","date":"2000-05-15","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Jones\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n.style2 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINAIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Cheri L.

Jones, of Harlingen, Texas, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to be suspended from the practice of law for thirty days. We accept the agreement. The facts in the agreement are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuto Accident Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent represented client and her husband in connection with an auto accident in which husband was involved in 1994. In December 1995, client was served with a Summons and Complaint filed on behalf of State Farm against the Estate of husband and client individually, seeking the payment of all amounts paid to the injured party. Client promptly delivered the Summons and Complaint to respondent within thirty days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to answer the Summons and Complaint, to file a motion, or to otherwise enter a responsive pleading on behalf of client. She did not seek to have client stricken from the action on the ground client had been improperly named as an individual defendant in the Summons and Complaint. Respondent did not advise the court that the action against the Estate and client was brought in an improper venue and failed to keep client informed of the status of her case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June 1996, respondent terminated her representation of client and accepted an employment position outside of South Carolina. She failed to give client proper notice of the termination of representation and failed to provide client with a copy of her file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy failing to take any action, a default judgment was entered against client and respondent failed to take any action to have the default judgment against client overturned. Client eventually filed a malpractice action against respondent, during which respondent's insurance carrier paid the judgment against client and paid an additional amount to settle the malpractice action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReal Estate Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 1996, respondent was the closing attorney in a real estate transaction. She failed to prepare a HUD-1 Closing Statement as required by 24 C.F.R. Â§3500.8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdoption Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September 1995, Respondent represented client in an adoption action. She drafted and filed a Summons and Complaint to consummate the adoption process that did not comply with South Carolina Code Â§Â§ 20-7-1646 to 1897 (the South Carolina Adoption Act). Additionally, the Consent to Adoption and Waiver of Service prepared by respondent did not comply with the South Carolina Adoption Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to request, schedule and conduct a final hearing prior to terminating her representation of client. The action was later stricken from the docket and could not be restored since it did not comply with the South Carolina Adoption Act. Since respondent had moved out of South Carolina, client had to retain new counsel to complete the adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to complete representation of client within a reasonable period of time after she was retained and did not adequately protect client's interest upon termination of representation. Respondent failed to refund any part of her fee until client filed a complaint against her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has violated numerous provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR. She failed to provide competent representation. Rule 1.1. Respondent failed to consult with a client and failed to abide by a client's wishes. Rule 1.2. Respondent failed to diligently represent a client. Rule 1.3. She failed to properly communicate with a client. Rule 1.4. Respondent improperly terminated representation of a client. Rule 1.16. She engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Rule 8.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, respondent has violated provisions of the RLDE contained in Rule 413, SCACR, including violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 7(a)(1).

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21, Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension of six months and one day.1 We accept the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts in the agreement are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained by a couple for representation in a domestic matter concerning the custody of two minor children from the husband's prior marriage. The husband's former wife, who had custody of the children, resided in Georgia. The couple's purpose in retaining respondent was to change the custody of the two children to joint custody. Respondent accepted a fee of $420 from the couple in exchange for his legal services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent prepared a Summons and Complaint regarding the custody issues. Respondent mailed the Summons and Complaint to the husband's former wife in Georgia. After completion of the pleadings, the couple found that respondent became increasingly difficult to reach, until he eventually ceased to respond to their attempts to contact him. As a result of respondent's unavailability, the couple was unable to expeditiously pursue the litigation in accordance with their interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe couple subsequently sent a letter of complaint regarding respondent's actions to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. In response, the Commission sent respondent a letter, dated September 17, 1998, requesting a response within fifteen days. Respondent did not reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission sent respondent another letter, dated October 13, 1998, requesting a response to the couple's complaint. The letter also reminded respondent that a failure to cooperate with a disciplinary authority could, in and of itself, be grounds for discipline. Respondent did not reply in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, on June 24, 1999, respondent replied to the Commission, enclosing a letter he had sent to the couple. In the enclosed letter, respondent informed them that he had closed his office, had not completed his work for them, was refunding their fees, and had enclosed the Summons and Complaint he had prepared along with proof of service. Respondent concluded with the suggestion that the couple seek other counsel. On August 24, 1999, the Commission sent respondent a Notice of Full Investigation regarding this and two other matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClient retained respondent on or about February 20, 1997, to represent her in an divorce. Client paid respondent a cash fee in the amount of $800.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the course of his representation, respondent failed to communicate in a timely fashion with Client and did not return Client's telephone calls or messages concerning the status of her case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an effort to locate respondent, Client sent two letters, dated June 10, 1998, and July 13, 1998, certified mail, return receipt requested. Both letters were received by respondent. Respondent did not reply to either letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter receiving a letter of complaint from Client, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct sent a letter, dated October 6, 1998, requesting a response within fifteen days. Respondent did not reply in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, on June 24, 1999, respondent replied to the Commission, enclosing a copy of a letter he had sent to Client. The letter informed Client that respondent had closed his office and had not completed the work for which he had been hired. Enclosed with the letter to Client was a refund of the fee of $800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 24, 1999, the Commission sent respondent a Notice of Full Investigation regarding this matter, and required a response within thirty days. Respondent did not reply in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained by Client for a domestic matter. Client paid respondent a fee of $420.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to properly communicate with Client and keep her informed of the status of her case. Respondent did not inform Client that he had closed his office. Client learned respondent had closed his office by attempting to visit respondent at his former office. Respondent did not return Client's telephone calls or messages left for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent's failure to notify Client of his actions resulted in her not being able to pursue the litigation in accordance with her interests. Client sent respondent a letter, dated September 17, 1998, advising him that she had been unable to reach him and requesting a response. Respondent did not respond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to a letter from the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, on June 24, 1999, respondent sent the Commission a letter enclosing a copy of a letter respondent had sent to Client. The enclosed letter stated that respondent was returning his fee to Client along with her client file and informed her that, prior to closing his office, he had served her husband with a complaint. Respondent suggested to Client that she retain other counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 24, 1999, the Commission sent respondent a Notice of Full Investigation regarding this matter, requiring a response in thirty days. Respondent did not reply to the Notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained by Client sometime in August 1997 for a divorce. Client paid respondent a fee of $850. Respondent prepared and filed a Summons and Complaint for the divorce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter, Client was unable to reach respondent, despite his many attempts to do so. Respondent's failure to keep Client informed precluded his making informed decisions regarding family court matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1998, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct sent respondent a Notice of Full Investigation regarding this matter, requiring a response within thirty days. Respondent did not reply in a timely fashion to the Notice. However, on June 24, 1999, respondent replied to the Commission, stating he had sent a full refund to Client along with his client file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Defendant in a criminal matter in May of 1997. Defendant was convicted on or about May 22, 1997. By the time of his letter to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct in July 1998, Defendant was confined at Allendale Correctional Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his conviction, Defendant and his parents made numerous unsuccessful attempts to obtain the client file from respondent in order to deliver it to Defendant's new attorney in Mount Pleasant. Respondent closed his office without informing Defendant. His failure to communicate with Defendant unduly delayed the preparation of Defendant's post-conviction relief application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter, on July 30, 1998, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct sent respondent a letter, requesting a response to Defendant's letter of July 1998, and reminding respondent that failure to cooperate with a disciplinary counsel could itself be a grounds for discipline. There was no response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 3, 1998, the Commission sent a Notice of Full Investigation to respondent, requiring a response within thirty days. Respondent did not respond in a timely fashion. However, on or about June 24, 1999, respondent requested an extension of time in which to reply to the Notice of Full Investigation. Respondent's request was granted, and he received an extension until July 15, 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent replied by letter on July 14, 1999. Respondent stated that he had had the file copied and returned to Defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(violated a Rule of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3)(willfully violated a valid order of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct), Rule 7(a)(5)(engaged in conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law or bringing the legal profession into disrepute). Further, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.2 (failed to abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation), Rule 1.3 (failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in the representation of a client), Rule 1.4 (failed to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of litigation and failed to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information), Rule 8.4(a)(violated the Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 8.4(e)(engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy his actions, respondent has brought the legal profession into disrepute and has forsaken the trust placed in him by the citizens of this State. Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended for six months and one day for his conduct. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Respondent's license to practice law was suspended on May 4, 1999 by administrative action for failure to comply with continuing legal education requirements. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25130","title":"State v.

Anne Pearce, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: The Court of Appeals vacated respondent's attempted murder conviction and sentence. State v. Sutton, 333 S.C. 192, 508 S.E.2d 41(Ct. App. 1998). We granted the State a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision. We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 22, 1994, respondent Michael Sutton shot Dennis Thomas three times at a Florence nightclub. Thomas died over a year and a day later on January 22, 1996.1 Sutton was indicted for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), attempted murder, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. At trial, Sutton moved for a directed verdict on the ground that ABIK and attempted murder are the same offense. The trial judge denied Sutton's motion. The jury convicted Sutton on all charges and he was sentenced to twenty years for the ABIK; life for the attempted murder, to run concurrently, and five years for the possession of a firearm offense, to run consecutively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in vacating Sutton's attempted murder. conviction and sentence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held ABIK and attempted murder are the same offense and since ABIK embraces the whole offense of attempted murder, in essence, there was a double jeopardy violation.2The State contends this was error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have never been presented with the issue whether attempted murder is an offense in this state. We read the Court of Appeals' decision to hold that the offense of attempted murder does not exist. The Court of Appeals states that ABIK embraces the whole of attempted murder and then states the cases have always equated ABIK with attempted murder. We agree in result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABIK 3 is an unlawful act of violent nature to the person of another with malice aforethought, either express or implied. State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996). The often cited language to describe ABIK is: if the victim had died from the injury, the defendant would have been guilty of murder. See, e.g., State v. Atkins, 293 S.C. 294, 360 S.E.2d 302, 305 (1987). Furthermore, a specific intent is not required to commit ABIK. State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50, 51(1996).4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, \"[a]ttempt is a specific intent crime.\" 21 Am.Jur.2d Criminal Law Â§176 (1998). \"The act constituting the attempt must be done with the intent to commit that particular crime.\" Id. See also Wharton's Criminal Law Attempt Â§Â§694-695 (1996)(\"To constitute an attempt, there must be an intent to commit a particular crime . . . Although a murder may be committed without an intent to kill, an attempt to commit murder requires a specific intent to kill.\")5 In the context of an \"attempt\" crime, specific intent means that the defendant consciously intended the completion of acts comprising the choate offense. In other words, the completion of such acts is the defendant's purpose. United States v. Calloway, 116 F.3d 1129 (6th Cir. 1997). Attempted murder would require the specific intent to kill and conduct towards that end. ABIK requires an unlawful act of violence to the person of another with malice. Clearly, each offense has an element the other does not. However, simply because convictions for both offenses would not violate double jeopardy, we are not constrained to recognize the offense of attempted murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder our current common law, we recognize ABIK and assault with intent to kill (AIK). Assault has been defined as an \"attempted battery\" or an unlawful attempt or offer to commit a violent injury upon another person, coupled with the present ability to complete the attempt or offer by a battery. State v. Mims, 286 S.C. 553, 335 S.E.2d 237 (1985). Under this definition of assault pointing a toy gun at someone or withholding insulin from a diabetic would not be an AIK. However, the Court has on at least two occasions defined an assault as placing another in apprehension of harm. In State v. Sims, 34 S.C.L. (3 Strob.) 137 (1848), the Court held if a defendant rode his horse so near the victim so as to cause the victim to believe he intended to ride upon or strike him, he would be guilty of an assault. More recently, in In re McGee, 278 S.C. 506, 299 S.E.2d 334, 334-335 (1983), we held \"[w]hile words alone do not constitute an assault, State v. Lymburn, 3 S.C.L. (1 Brev.) 397 (1804), if by words and conduct a person intentionally creates a reasonable apprehension of bodily harm, it is an assault. State v. Sims, 34 S.C.L. (3 Strob.) 137 (1848); see generally LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law Â§ 82 (1972). Thus, if a person `shook his hickory over his head, indicating an intention to strike, and within striking distance,' and `if his action and conduct were such as to create the belief in the mind of the [victim] that he intended to ... strike him, he would be guilty of an assault.' Sims, at 138; see also State v. Davis, 19 S.C.L. (1 Hill) 46 (1833).\"6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with the majority of jurisdictions. All jurisdictions recognize the attempted battery type of assault. The intentional creation of apprehension of immediate bodily harm type of assault has been specifically adopted as a definition of criminal assault by most jurisdictions. LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law Â§ 82 (1972). See also, e.g., Ott v. State, 11 Md.App. 259, 273 A.2d 630 (Ct. App. 1971). Thus, pointing a toy gun at someone or withholding life-saving medication may be an AIK if the person is placed in fear of bodily harm even though the defendant does not have the ability to complete a battery and/or there is not an attempted battery.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe decline to recognize a separate offense of attempted murder. We think with the clarifications of our definition of assault made in this decision, the offense of attempted murder is unnecessary.8 Our common law offenses of ABIK and AIK adequately cover the conduct which attempted murder\r\nwould include.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1The common law rule is that if a victim dies over a year and a day later, he can not be charged with murder. William S. McAninch and W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina 72 (3d ed. 1996). We question the applicability of this rule with present day medical advances which could sustain a victim's life for an indefinite period. However, this is not an issue in this case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Sutton appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeals solely on the ground they violated the double jeopardy clause. In his reply brief to the Court of Appeals, he argued that there is no offense of attempted murder. In reversing, the Court of Appeals stated the offense of ABIK embraces the whole offense of attempted murder. The Court of Appeals then cited several cases in which convictions were vacated because the underlying criminal statutes were no longer in effect (i.e. the courts did not have subject matter jurisdiction). The Court of Appeals clearly applied a double jeopardy analysis and yet then cited several subject matter jurisdiction cases as authority for vacating Sutton's attempted murder conviction. Sutton contends the State's argument is procedurally barred. The Court of Appeals combined the issue to include both subject matter jurisdiction and double jeopardy and now, in all fairness, one issue can not be separated from-the other. Furthermore, we think the State adequately raised both the issues of double jeopardy and subject matter jurisdiction in its petition for rehearing.  \r\n3We note ABIK is punishable by imprisonment not to exceed twenty years. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-620 (1985). A person who commits the common law offense of attempt, is punishable as for the principal offense. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1-80 (Supp. 1999). Thus, attempted murder may be punishable by a life sentence or imprisonment for thirty years. See S.C. Code Ann.&sect;16-3-20 (Supp. 1999)(punishment for murder).\r\n4Foust was decided in December 1996, 9 months after Sutton's trial.  \r\n5 A specific intent to kill may be, and normally is, inferred from the surrounding circumstances, such as the character of the attack, the use of a deadly weapon, and the nature and extent of the victim's injuries. People v. Parker, 724 N.E.2d 203 (I11.App. Ct. 1st Dist.1999).\r\n6There is a good discussion of this subject in William S. McAninch and W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina 186-187 (3d ed. 1996).  \r\n7The Model Penal Code &sect;211.1 states \"[a] person is guilty of assault if he: (a) attempts to cause or purposely, knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another; or (b) negligently causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon; or (c) attempts by physical menace to put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.\"\r\n8Furthermore, we note that had Thomas died within a year, Sutton could have been convicted at most of murder and received a life sentence. Because Sutton lived for over a year and a day after the shooting, Sutton was convicted of both attempted murder and ABIK and received a life sentence and 20 years; albeit in this case, the sentences were to run concurrently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25131","title":"Branch et al., v.

Both Firemen joined Local 2345, a labor union and local affiliate of the International Association of Firefighters. In August of 1993, petitioner Womack, acting in his official capacity as the City's Fire Chief, issued a written policy stating in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Non-supervisory firefighters have the right to join and form any organization they wish.\r\n  2.  Supervisory firefighters (those holding the rank of Lieutenant and above) may join, affiliate with, support, or form any organization they wish except a labor organization or union which seeks to represent the interests of non-supervisory firefighters of the City of Myrtle Beach. Such membership or affiliation or support would be a conflict of interest on the part of the supervisory firefighter.\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original). In response to the policy, the Firemen terminated their union membership and instituted this lawsuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Firemen base their claim on S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-7-10 through -90 (1976)(the \"right-to-work\" statute). Section 41-7-30 of the right-to-work statute states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  It shall be unlawful for any employer:\r\n  (1) To require any employee, as a condition of employment, or of continuance of employment, to be or become or remain a member or affiliate of any labor organization or agency;\r\n  (2) To require any employee, as a condition of employment, or of continuance of employment, to abstain or refrain from membership in any labor organization; . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). The Firemen claimed the City's policy violated the statute because the City qualified as an employer under the statute and they qualified as employees. The Firemen also argued that the statute applied whether or not they were supervisory employees. Additionally, the Firemen argued they were not in fact supervisory employees of the City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City responded by arguing the right-to-work statute does not apply to public employment. The trial court agreed and ruled that the City's policy was proper because the right-to-work statute does not apply to the state or its political subdivisions. The Firemen appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case. See Branch v. City of Myrtle Beach, 332 S.C. 575, 505 S.E.2d 925 (Ct. App. 1998). The City appealed and this Court granted certiorari on the following issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in ruling that South Carolina's right to-work statute is applicable to governmental employers such as the City of Myrtle Beach and its Fire Department?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City argues the Court of Appeals erred by adopting a \"plain meaning\" definition of the phrase \"any employer\" that includes public employment. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time the legislature enacted the right-to-work statute, labor relations statutes did not apply to public employment unless coverage was specifically required by the statute's language. See 51 C.J.S. Labor Relations Â§ 33 (1967)(\"Labor relations statutes in general apply to private industry only and not to public employment unless the legislature shows a definite intent to include political subdivisions.\").1Modern authorities have moved away from this policy of excluding public employment because they disfavor supporting governmental immunity against an individual who would have been able to recover against a private entity in a similar situation. See Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction Â§62.03 at 223 (5th ed. 1992). However, at the time of the right-to-work statute's enactment, a review of other state labor statutes reveals the South Carolina legislature followed the traditional approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor other employment statutes, the legislature adopted definitions of \"employer\" that specifically include coverage of public employment. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§41-10-10 (Supp. 1999) (Payment of Wages statute); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-13-5 (1976) (Child Labor statute); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§41-27-210 &amp; -220 (1976) (Employment Security statute); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-140 (1976)(Workers' Compensation statute). The inclusion of such definitions covering public employment is consistent with the traditional rule of excluding public employment from coverage unless the statute reveals an intent to do otherwise. These statutes also contain phrases limiting the definitions to their respective chapters and articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals' opinion did not address this traditional rule of statutory construction and instead relied on a \"plain meaning\" analysis of the term \"any employer\" to find the statute applied to public employers because the statute did not specifically exclude public employment.\r\n\r\n2Initially, we disagree with the Court of Appeals' finding that a plain meaning definition of the term \"any employer\" results in coverage of public employment. By ignoring the traditional rule of construction, the Court of Appeals flipped the presumption from one of exclusion of public employment to one of inclusion of public employment. In light of the legislature's adherence to the traditional approach in other labor relations statutes, this presumption shifting was in error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is for the Court to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. Lester v. South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n, 334 S.C. 557, 514 S.E.2d 751(1999). When faced with an undefined statutory term, the Court must interpret the term in accord with its usual and customary meaning. Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998). Courts should consider not merely the language of the particular clause being construed, but the undefined word and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law. Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997). If the Court of Appeals had adopted the customary meaning of \"any employer\" with regards to labor relations statutes, a \"plain meaning\" interpretation would result in the exclusion of public employers from the statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the current case, even if the plain meaning of \"any employer\" did not exclude public employment, then at best the term would be unclear in light of the rule of statutory construction excluding public employment from coverage by labor relations statutes. Since the meaning of \"any employer\". would then be ambiguous, the Court could look beyond that specific section in determining legislative intent. A comparison between the right-to-work section and other statutory sections covering labor relations reveals the other statutes specifically include definitions covering public employment while the right-to-work statute does not. In light of the traditional construction of labor relations statutes, we believe that by not having a definition including public employment, the legislature's intent was not to cover public employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals also relies heavily on the abolition of sovereign immunity as a basis for holding the right-to-work statute applicable to political subdivisions. The majority opinion states: \"Once sovereign immunity was abolished in 1985, the General Assembly could have amended the right-to-work statute to exclude the state if it had so desired.\" Branch v. City of Myrtle Beach, 332 S.C. 575, 580, 505 S.E.2d 925, 927 (Ct. App. 1998). Initially, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the significance of the legislature's choice in 1954 to not waive tort immunity for the state under the right-to-work statute. Since the right-to-work statute did not expressly waive the state's tort immunity, before the abolition of sovereign immunity in 1985, it would have been impossible to sue the government under the right-to-work statute. Instead of analyzing the legislative intent behind the statute, the Court of Appeals adopted an approach where simply because the state no longer has sovereign immunity against a right-to-work suit, the definition of employer under that statute somehow changed to include public employers. Such an approach completely ignores all of the other policy reasons behind excluding public employment from the right to-work statute and directly conflicts with the analysis of the legislative intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abolition of sovereign immunity by this Court in McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985), does not supply any indication of the legislative intent in 1954 about whether to include public employment under the right-to-work statute. The Court of Appeals observed that the legislature could have gone back to restore the state's immunity under the right-to-work statute. This action would be unnecessary if, as apparent from the statutory construction of the legislative intent, the statute as a whole does not cover public employment. There would be no need for the legislature to reestablish immunity for the state under a statute that does not apply to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, other reasons beyond just sovereign immunity existed in 1954, as well as exist -today, supporting the exclusion of public employment from the right-to-work statute. Unlike private employees, public employees in South Carolina do not have the right to collective bargaining. See McNair Resolution, H. 1636,1969 S.C. Sen. Jour. 826 (April 5, 1969); 1969 House Jour. 942 (April 30,1969); see also Dennis R. Nolan, Public Employee Unionism in the Southeast: The Legal Parameters, 29 S.C. L. Rev. 235, 287 (1978). As a result, even if the right-to-work statute applied to public employment, significant aspects of the statute would be totally irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-7-40 (1976) \"any employer\" is entitled to deduct union membership dues from employee wages. Public employers are specifically forbidden from this practice by S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 8-11-83 &amp; -92 (1976). Likewise, S.C. Code Ann. Â§41-7-80 (1976) allows the imposition of a criminal penalty against \"any employer\" who violates a provision of the chapter. Such criminal penalties are inapplicable to public employers. Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-7-90 (1976) \"any person\" may seek punitive damages for a violation of the statute, but public employers cannot by law be liable for punitive damages. It is important to recognize that despite their inapplicability to public employment, each of these statutory sections use the term \"any employer\" and \"any person\" just as the statutory section in dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of these sections, the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the right to-work statute covering public employment creates conflicts between several statutory provisions. \"If the provisions of the two statutes can be construed so that both can stand, this Court will so construe them.\" In the Interest of Shaw, 274 S.C. 534, 539, 265 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1980). Interpreting the right-to-work statute as excluding public employment creates no conflict with other statutory provisions. Judge Cureton's concurrence recognizes the conflict their opinion creates, but finds that the courts can just overlook the conflicting portions of the right-to-work statutes. We believe the better construction is to retain an interpretation that creates no conflict with any other statutory provisions by finding the right-to-work statute does not apply to public employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general inapplicability of many aspects of the right-to-work statute led to the 1964 Attorney General's Opinion finding the right-to-work act inapplicable to public employment. The Attorney General found:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [I]t was not the intent of the legislature to include public employment within the scope of [the right-to-work statute]. Mere reference to sections of the right-to-work law pertaining to conspiracies, picketing, and damages recoverable against the employers violating such sections, makes it obvious that this law is not applicable to public employment.\r\n\r\n1964 S.C. Op. Atty. Gen. 298. Significantly, this Attorney General opinion did not rely on the concept of sovereign immunity. Also, scholarly discussion on this issue supports the position that South Carolina's right-to-work statute does not apply to public employment. See Dennis R. Nolan, Public Employee Unionism an the Southeast: The Legal Parameters, 29 S.C. L. Rev. 235, 287 (1978)(\"The law . . . is part of the state's right-to-work act, which does not apply to public employees.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we hold the Court of Appeals erred in finding the right-to work statute covers public employment. First, the plain meaning of the phrase \"any employer\" in a labor relations statute excludes public employment. Second, even if the Court looked beyond the plain meaning, a review of other South Carolina labor statutes reveals that when the legislature desired to cover public employment it includes a definition doing so. Third, the failure to waive sovereign immunity in 1954 demands an interpretation that the statute excluded public employment at that time. The abolition of sovereign immunity by this Court in 1985 reveals nothing about the legislative intent behind a statute passed in 1954 and whether that statute applied to public employment. Fourth, the Court of Appeals' decision creates conflict between statutory sections while a holding that the statute does not cover public employment creates no conflict. Finally, since it has generally been recognized that the right-to-work statute does not apply to public employment, the decision to dramatically change the status quo should be made by the legislature and not judicially by the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we REVERSE the Court of Appeals' decision including public employment under the right-to-work statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1See also Norman J.

Crosby.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: Appellant commenced this action for wrongful death in his capacity as personal representative of the estate of his stillborn child. The trial judge granted respondents' motion for summary judgment on the ground a nonviable stillborn fetus cannot maintain such an action. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent Kristie Crosby was twenty weeks pregnant when she was injured in a automobile accident. The car she was driving collided with a truck owned and operated by respondent Glasscock Trucking Co., Inc. It is undisputed the fetus Kristie was carrying was nonviable at the time of the accident. The fetus was delivered stillborn later the same day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant commenced this action pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-51-10 (1976) which allows for a civil action to recover damages for the wrongful death of a \"person.\"1 When enacted, our wrongful death statute created a new cause of action in derogation of the common law rule that a tort action dies with the death of the injured person. In re: Mayo's Estate, 60 S.C. 401, 38 S.E. 634, 638 (1901). A statute creating a cause of action in derogation of common law is a statute of creation. Simpson v. Sanders, 314 S.C. 413, 445 S.E.2d 93 (1994); Hyder v. Jones, 271 S.C. 85, 245 S.E.2d 123 (1978). Such a statute must be strictly construed and its application must not be extended beyond the clear intent of the legislature. Davenport v. Summer, 273 S.C. -771, 259 S.E.2d 815 (1979).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstruing this statute, in West v. McCoy, 233 S.C. 369, 105 S.E.2d 88 (1958), we held a nonviable stillborn fetus cannot maintain a wrongful death action. West is still valid 2 and controls this case. To justify overruling West, the dissent posits hypothetically that a nonviable fetus could maintain a cause of action if born alive and therefore a stillborn nonviable fetus should have the same right. The fact that a fetus is born alive, however, is indisputable evidence that it is viable because it has in fact lived independently of its mother. See Hudak v. George, 535 Pa. 152, 634 A.2d 600 (1993) (infant born alive is a person and concept of viability is irrelevant when infant survives birth). Allowing an action by a nonviable but born alive fetus is therefore fundamentally different from a case such as this where the fetus is not born alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA mother who is negligently injured by the same act that results in the stillbirth of her fetus may, of course, seek recovery for her own personal injuries. The dissent would have us go further by allowing an independent civil action on the fetus's behalf. Such an action could in fact be brought against the mother where the mother herself is alleged to be negligent in the death of her nonviable stillborn fetus, as in this case, or where the mother has exercised her right to a legal abortion. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-41-20 (1985). Further, such a civil suit could encompass liability for personal conduct of the mother that allegedly affects the fetus. While we understand the devastating loss of an unborn child, we are not convinced.of the soundness of such a policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsistent with our decision in West, the majority of courts have held a nonviable stillborn fetus cannot maintain an independent wrongful death action. See, e.g., Gentry v. Gilmore, 613 So.2d 1241 (Ala. 1993); Humes v. Clinton, 246 Kan. 590, 792 P.2d 1032 (1990); Kandel v. White, 339 Md. 432, 663 A.2d 1264 (1995); Thibert v. Milka, 419 Mass. 696, 646 N.E.2d 1025 (1995); Wallace v. Wallace, 120 N.H. 675, 421 A.2d 134 (1980); Coveleski v. Bubnis, 535 Pa. 166, 634 A.2d 608 (1993); Miccolis v. AMICA Mut. Ins. Co., 587 A.2d 67 (1991). Courts addressing this issue have invariably deferred to the legislature in rejecting a wrongful death action by a nonviable stillborn fetus. The dissent would have us join a minority of jurisdictions to judicially allow such an action, a minority that includes only West Virginia. Because a wrongful death action is a legislatively created one, we find deference to the legislature especially appropriate in this matter.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold a nonviable stillborn fetus may not maintain a wrongful death action under Â§ 15-51-10. Accordingly, the order granting respondents' motion for summary judgment is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., and WALLER, J., concur. TOAL and BURNETT, JJ., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n1This section provides in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n  Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured ....\r\n\r\n2Our two subsequent cases allowing such an action, Hall v. Murphy, 236 S.C. 257, 113 S.E.2d 790 (1960), and Fowler v. Woodward, 244 S.C. 608, 138 S.E.2d 42 (1964), involved viable fetuses and did not modify the holding of West as appellant claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3Our legislature is currently considering this issue. Bill H. 3863 would\r\n\r\namend Title 15 of the South Carolina Code Annotated by adding: \"Section\r\n15-5-5: For purposes of a civil cause of action, `person' includes an unborn\r\nchild at every stage of gestation in utero from conception until live birth.\"\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J.: I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sole issue before this Court is whether a cause of action exists under the South Carolina wrongful death statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-10 (1976), for the negligently induced stillbirth of a nonviable fetus. The statute imposes three requirements for recovery: (1) the death of a person; (2) a wrongful or negligent act by the defendant; and (3) causation.1d This appeal focuses on whether Appellant can satisfy the statute's first requirement, death of a \"person.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. PRENATAL INJURY UNDER SOUTH CAROLINA CASE LAW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have addressed the issue of civil recovery for prenatal injury and death on three occasions: West v. McCoy, 233 S.C. 369, 105 S.E.2d 88 (1958); Hall v. Murphy, 236 S.C. 257, 113 S.E.2d 790 (1960); and Fowler v. Woodward, 244 S.C. 608, 138 S.E.2d 42 (1964).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn West v. McCoy, supra, the defendant crashed his automobile into the rear of the plaintiff's car. The plaintiff was at the time about five months pregnant. As a result of the accident the plaintiff experienced cramps and vaginal bleeding. The plaintiff's doctor advised her to remain in bed. For about a month following the accident, the plaintiff continued to feel the fetal movements of her child. However, not long thereafter, the plaintiff suffered a miscarriage in which the fetus was born dead. The plaintiff brought a wrongful death action against the defendant. This Court recognized the prevailing common law view that a cause of action could be maintained where prenatal injuries resulted in disability or death after live birth, and where the infant was viable and capable of being delivered and remaining alive separate from its mother at the time of injury. In West, the Court noted that the fetus neither was viable at the time of the injury nor was it born alive. Thus, the plaintiff was precluded from suing for the wrongful death of her fetus. The Court expressly declined to decide whether it would follow the common law view that an action could be maintained by a child injured while en ventre sa mere 2d and born alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Hall v. Murphy, supra, this Court answered the question left open in West. We held for the first time that a cause of action for wrongful death could be maintained for prenatal injuries occurring to a viable3d fetus in cases where the child was born alive and then died as a result of those injuries. We rejected the reasons previously advanced against recovery for prenatal injuries, e.g., the difficulty in determining a causal relationship between a prenatal injury and the death or the condition of the child, the possibility of fictitious claims, the belief that a child was not a person until born, and lack of precedent. We recognized that the inherent difficulty in proving a causal relationship between a prenatal injury and the damage which subsequently becomes apparent presents no insurmountable problem, at least in cases where the child is born alive. Further, questions about causation and reasonable certainty which will arise in these cases are no different from questions about causation arising in other negligence actions. This Court noted that a few courts had gone even further to hold that a cause of action could be maintained for injuries to a nonviable fetus later born alive. However, the Court in Hall declined to decide this issue since it was not before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last decision, Fowler v. Woodward, supra, we abandoned the requirement of live birth and held that recovery could be had for the wrongful death of a stillborn, viable fetus. In Fowler, we commented on our wrongful death statute and its requirements as follows: \"An action for wrongful death will lie, under the terms of the statute, when the death of a person is caused by the act, neglect or default of another and the act is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action.\" Fowler, 244 S.C. at 612-13, 138 S.E.2d at 44. We concluded, \"we see no more reason why [the cause of action] should be cut off because of the child's death before birth, than if it died thereafter.\" Id. at 614, 138 S.E.2d at 45 (quoting State v. Sherman, 198 A.2d 71, 73 (Md. 1964)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1964, when we first recognized a cause of action in Fowler for the wrongful death of a stillborn, viable fetus, South Carolina was among a minority of jurisdictions to do so. At the time, the prevailing view among other jurisdictions was that an unborn fetus, whether viable or not, was not a \"person\" as contemplated under the terms of the wrongful death statutes enacted by state legislatures. Rather, it was only upon birth that a \"person\" was said to begin existence as a complete, separate individual. In earlier decisions, like West, courts understood that a viable fetus could exist apart from the mother if delivered at any point during the viability stage. See West, 233 S.C. at 375,105 S.E.2d at 91(\"A fetus generally becomes a viable child between the sixth and seventh month of its existence.\"). Nevertheless, the majority of jurisdictions refused to recognize that a viable fetus was a \"person\" for purposes of the wrongful death statute. This Court in Fowler recognized the inconsistency of this rule which allowed recovery for prenatal injuries when the child was born alive, but not when the child was stillborn. In essence, a defendant was better off if the wrongful or negligent conduct was severe enough to cause the death of the fetus while still in the mother's womb. The Court rejected this illogical approach, stating:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The cause of action arose at the time of the injury and we see no more reason why it should be cut off because of the child's death before birth, than if it died thereafter. The wrongful act would have entitled the \"party injured to maintain an action . . . if death had not ensued,\" and under the plain words of the death statute we think the action survives, or permits the parents to recover, notwithstanding the death of the child.\r\n\r\nFowler, 244 S.C. at 614, 138 S.E.2d at 45 (quoting State v. Sherman, 198 A.2d 71, 72 (Md. 1964).4d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. PRENATAL INJURY STATUTES AND CASE LAW FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first American decision to address prenatal injury and wrongful death was Dietrich v. Inhabitants of Northampton, 138 Mass. 14, 52 Am.Rep. 242 (1884). In Dietrich, the mother fell when she was four or five months pregnant and thereafter gave birth prematurely to a child who lived only fifteen minutes. Justice Holmes held that because an unborn child was a part of the mother, no action could be maintained for wrongful death of the child, but that any damage to the child, if not too remote to be recoverable at all, was recoverable by the mother. Until the 1940's, nearly all jurisdictions considering the issue reached the same conclusion. See W. PAGE KEETON ET AL., PROSSER AND KEETON ON THE LAW OF TORTS Â§ 55, at 367 (5th ed. 1984).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning in the 1940s with Bonbrest v. Kotz, 65 F. Supp. 138 (D.D.C. 1946), courts around the country abandoned the holding of Dietrich. Today, every jurisdiction permits recovery for prenatal injuries if a child is born alive. See Farley v. Sartin, 466 S.E.2d 522, 528 (W. Va. 1995). This generally holds true regardless whether the injury occurred either before or after the point of viability. Id. The majority of jurisdictions also recognize a cause of action for the wrongful death of a stillborn, viable fetus.5dMany of the jurisdictions recently reviewing the issue have specifically held that a cause of action for wrongful death does not lie for a nonviable, stillborn fetus. See, e.g., Ferguson v. District of Columbia, 629 A.2d 15, 17 (D.C. 1993); Humes v. Clinton, 792 P.2d 1032, 1037 (Kan. 1990); Kandel v. White, 663 A.2d 1264 (Md. 1995).6d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only state judicially providing recovery for a stillborn fetus in the absence of viability is West Virginia. In West Virginia, the Supreme Court of Appeals recently held that \"the term 'person,' as used in [the West Virginia wrongful death statute] . . . encompasses a nonviable unborn child and, thus, permits a cause of action for the tortious death of such child.\" Farley v. Sartin, 466 S.E.2d 522, 534 (W. Va. 1995). Previously, in Baldwin v. Butcher, 184 S.E.2d 428 (W. Va. 1971), that court had recognized a cause of action for a viable, stillborn fetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few jurisdictions have enacted additional statutes or amended their wrongful death statutes to include coverage for a fetus.7d\r\n\r\nFor example, South Dakota has amended its wrongful death statute to provide that \"the death or injury of a person, including an unborn child,\" gives rise to a cause of action for wrongful death.8d\r\n\r\n Illinois has enacted a fetal death statute which specifically allows wrongful death actions to be maintained regardless of a fetus' gestational development at the time of injury.9d\r\n\r\n The Missouri legislature has enacted a statute providing life begins at conception and further, that the laws of the state should be interpreted to confer to unborn children at all stages of development all of the rights available to other, citizens of the state.10d\r\n\r\n Although Montana has not amended its wrongful death act to include a fetus, it has enacted a separate statute defining \"unborn child\" which states, \"A child conceived but not yet born is to be deemed an existing person, so far as may be necessary for its interests in the event of its subsequent birth.\" 11d\r\n\r\n Louisiana has a similar provision which states, \"An unborn child shall be considered as a natural person for whatever relates to its interest from the moment of conception. If the child is born dead, it shall be considered never to have existed as a person, except for purposes of actions resulting from its wrongful death.\" 12d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. SOUTH CAROLINA WRONGFUL DEATH STATUTE CONSTRUED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe precise question presented to this Court is whether a nonviable fetus may be considered a person for purposes of the wrongful death statute. In addressing this issue, I would begin with the question left open by this Court in Hall, supra: whether a cause of action lies for injuries to a nonviable fetus that is later born alive and survives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder our wrongful death statute, an action may be brought \"Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof...\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-51-10 (1976). Thus, it must be decided whether, in the instant case, the nonviable fetus could have maintained a cause of action in tort if it had continued to develop and was born alive with the injuries sustained during the nonviability stage. As noted above, it is generally recognized that a child may recover for prenatal injuries incurred either before or during viability, so long as the child is born alive. Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 869 and cmt. Subsection 1(d) at 267-77 (1977); 62A Am. Jur. 2d Prenatal Injuries: Wrongful Life, Birth, or Conception Â§18 (1990). I agree with this view because an injury sustained \"prior to viability is no less meritorious than a claim for one sustained afterward.\" 62A Am Jur. 2d, supra Â§ 19 at 413. It would be illogical to provide a cause of action to a child born with a defect arising out of an injury sustained during viability, while denying the same cause of action to a child whose injury occurred only a few weeks earlier during the nonviability stage. See Farley v. Sartin, 466 S.E.2d 522, 532 (W. Va. 1995). Thus, I believe that a cause of action would lie for an injury suffered by a nonviable fetus that is later born alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving decided that a child injured during the nonviability stage of fetal development could maintain a cause of action if born alive, I would hold that a nonviable fetus must also be considered a person for purposes of the wrongful death statute since, had death not ensued, the fetus would have been able to maintain an action. See Fowler, 244 S.C. at 614, 138 S.E.2d at 45. (\"The wrongful death act would have entitled the `party injured to maintain an action . . . if death had not ensued,' and under the plain words of the death statute we think the action survives, or permits the parents to recover, notwithstanding the death of the child.\") (citation omitted). A wrongful death cause of action should cover death at any point during fetal development beginning with conception. I recognize that nonviable fetuses, like fetuses that have reached the viability stage, may not always arrive at a successful birth. 13d\r\n\r\n However, in cases where it can be shown that a defendant's wrongful conduct terminated the fetus' normal progression, I find no logical basis for attaching legal importance to the concept of viability. 14d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSignificantly, my conclusion only removes the arbitrary hurdle of viability for those seeking recovery. As noted above, although proving a causal relationship between prenatal injury and the loss of the fetus is no longer an insurmountable task, the law still requires a plaintiff to prove traditional \"but for\" causation. By rejecting the \"loss of chance\" doctrine, this Court has refused to lessen the burden a plaintiff must meet in a tort action. See Jones v. Owings, 318 S.C. 72, 456 S.E.2d 371 (1995) (declining to adopt the loss of chance doctrine). A plaintiff cannot recover for the \"mere possibility that a tortfeasor's negligence was a cause of the ultimate harm.\" Id., 318 S.C. at 77, 456 S.E.2d at 374. Plaintiffs would still have to show that the defendant's actions most probably caused the death of the fetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI recognize that we would join a minority of jurisdictions that define \"person\" in this way for purposes' of the wrongful death statute. However, such a holding in this respect is consistent with our reasoning in Fowler. As discussed above, when Fowler was decided in 1964 we departed from the majority view which held that the stillbirth of a viable fetus did not give rise to a wrongful death action. The fact that we were in the minority did not prevent this Court from refusing to follow the illogic of requiring that a fetus be born alive before a cause of action could be brought for prenatal injuries. And, in fact, this view has now become one shared by the majority of jurisdictions. Thus, it is in keeping with this reasoning that I would decline to allow a defendant to escape liability when a nonviable fetus dies in the womb, but not when the fetus is injured and later born alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a holding is also consistent with our rules of statutory construction. At common law, there was no remedy in tort for a wrongful killing. Hubbard &amp; Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts, at 595 (2d ed. 1997). In 1859, the legislature enacted the wrongful, death statute to provide a remedy in tort for a wrongful killing. As with any remedial statute, we are bound to construe the law liberally to effectuate its purpose. South Carolina Dep't of Mental Health v. Hanna, 270 S.C. 210, 241 S.E.2d 563 (1978). I believe an interpretation of \"person\" that includes life from the point of conception is necessary to make the wrongful death statute consistent with its purpose. The wrongful death statute was originally enacted to avoid the harsh result of allowing a tortious wrongdoer to avoid liability where the victim died from the wrongful conduct. To preserve the statute's purpose, this logic must also be applied to prenatal injuries. If, under my approach, we allow a survivor of prenatal injuries to bring a cause of action regardless of when during fetal development the injuries were sustained, then we should also permit a wrongful death action if the injury resulted in immediate death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority argues our wrongful death statute is in derogation of the common law and therefore should be strictly construed. Initially, it should be noted that despite being in derogation of the common law, our wrongful death statute is a remedial statute. See Morris v. Spartanburg R. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 70 S.C. 279, 49 S.E. 854, 855 (1904)(\"'The [wrongful death] statute is remedial, and should be liberally construed, so as to accomplish its object.\"). Furthermore, we have long recognized that \"every remedial law must, of necessity, be in derogation of the common law.\" Flenniken v. Marshall, 43 S.C. 80, 20 S.E. 788, 789 (1895). As a result, \"The rule that remedial statutes are construed liberally is one of the most common exceptions to the rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be construed strictly.\" Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction Â§ 61.03, at 191 (5th ed. 1992). Accordingly, the majority's narrow approach would serve to defeat the purposes behind enacting the statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, my position is in line with the concept that tort liability is fault-based. See Fitzer v. Greater Greenville South Carolina Young Men's Christian Assoc., 277 S.C. 1, 3, 282 S.E.2d 230, 231 (1981) (\"There is no tenet more fundamental in our law than liability follows the tortious wrongdoer.\"). In fact, this Court has in recent decisions followed a trend .of abolishing well established tort doctrines which inhibit the proper apportioning of liability based on fault. See Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998) (abolishing the doctrine of assumption of risk as an absolute defense); Spahn v. Town of Port Royal, 330 S.C. 168, 499 S.E.2d 205 (1998) (abolishing the common law doctrine of last clear chance). Similarly, in the instant case, it is antithetical to our fault-based tort system to allow a negligent party to escape liability based solely on the blurred line of fetal viability. See Farley, 466 S.E.2d at 533 (\" [J]ustice is denied when a tortfeasor is permitted to walk away with impunity because of the happenstance that the unborn child had not yet reached viability at the time of death.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI realize that, if adopted, my position would be examined for its implications beyond the context of the wrongful death statute. For instance, it may be argued that my approach to the interpretation of \"person\" under the wrongful death statute could erode a woman's reproductive rights in the abortion context. However, I caution against any such inferences. My interpretation of \"person\" in this case is unique to the wrongful death statute and is further informed by principles of tort law. The United States Supreme Court has addressed the abortion controversy by balancing a woman's reproductive rights under the federal Constitution against the state's interests in protecting unborn children. See Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992); Roe v. Wade, supra. In balancing these interests, the Supreme Court has held that, prior to viability, the state may not prohibit a woman from making the choice to terminate her pregnancy. See Planned Parenthood, supra. However, the Court has expressly acknowledged that where there is no protected liberty interest at stake, the government can adopt any view of life it desires:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is conventional constitutional doctrine that where reasonable people disagree the government can adopt one position or the other. That theorem, however, assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty.\r\n\r\nPlanned Parenthood, 505 U.S. at 851, 112 S. Ct. at 2806-07, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the abortion cases, wrongful death actions do not automatically implicate any countervailing, constitutional liberties. No one can argue in this case that the state or federal constitution shields the defendants' allegedly wrongful conduct. Without any protected liberty interest to balance, we are free to define \"person\" under the South Carolina wrongful death statute in a way that conforms with the law's purpose. In keeping with this Court's prior decisions which have liberally construed the wrongful death statute, I believe a definition of \"person\" that includes life from the point of conception comports with the statute's goal of affording a remedy to parties who could have sued if they had survived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur decisions in Hall and Fowler have already modified the holding of West. Today, I would overrule West and hold that a cause of action lies for the wrongful death of a nonviable fetus. My refusal to recognize a distinction between viability and nonviability is based on the same logical reasoning this Court used in refusing to recognize a distinction between viable fetuses which are born alive then die and viable fetuses killed in the womb. See Hall, supra; Fowler, supra. The logical underpinnings of those opinions have been a part of South Carolina's jurisprudence for four decades now. My dissent today is not formed by any new approach toward the definition of \"person.\" Instead, this decision is the result of applying the logic of the relevant precedential cases in this area to the current issue at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, the concerns and justifications supporting our previous decisions militate toward an interpretation of \"person\" that will make the wrongful death statute consistent in its application. I note that it is within the power of our legislature to make the law more specific if it so chooses. Based on the foregoing, I would REVERSE the trial court's grant of summary judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1d Section 15-51-10 currently reads in its entirety as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as make the killing in law a felony. In the event of the death of the wrongdoer, such cause of action shall survive against his personal representative.\r\n\r\n2d En Ventre sa mere means \"in its mother's womb.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY \r\n\r\n534 (6th ed. 1990).\r\n\r\n3dA \"viable\" fetus is one \"that has reached such a stage of development that it can live outside of the uterus.\" See DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 1823 (28th ed. 1994). In West, we recognized that viability usually occurs between the sixth and seventh month of development and courts continue to follow this time frame for the definition of viability. See West, 233 S.C. at 375, 105 S.E.2d at 91; Sheldon R. Shapiro, Annotation, Right to Maintain Action or to Recover Damages for Death of Unborn Child, 84 A.L.R.3d 411, 432 n.72 (1978 &amp; Supp. 1999).\r\n4d A minority of jurisdictions continue to require that an individual be born alive to fall within the coverage of their wrongful death statutes. E.g., Chatelain v. Kelley, 910 S.W.2d 215 (Ark. 1995) (holding an unborn fetus is not a \"person\" within the terms of the Arkansas wrongful death statute in a case, of first impression in which the court declined to extend coverage to a viable, stillborn fetus).

A distinct minority of jurisdictions have determined viability is not a consideration in cases where a nonviable fetus is born alive. See, e.g., cases noted above and Hudak v. Georgy, 634 A.2d 600, 602 (Pa. 1993) (\"Viability describes the capacity of the unborn to survive outside the womb, and is not relevant when an infant survives birth.\"). This question is not before the Court in the case sub judice as the parties have stipulated that the fetus was nonviable and stillborn.\r\n7d For a comparison of the wrongful death statutes of all states, see 3 STUART \r\n\r\nM. SPEISER ET AL., RECOVERY FOR WRONGFUL DEATH AND INJURY Appendix A (1992 &amp; Supp. 1999). \r\n8d S. D. CODIFIED LAWS ANN. &sect; 21-5-1 (1987) (emphasis added). The South Dakota Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase, \"including an unborn child,\" as broadening coverage under the statute to include a nonviable fetus. Wiersma v. Maple Leaf Farms, 543 N.W.2d 787 (S.D. 1996). That court noted its interpretation was consistent with the South Dakota legislature's recent definition of \"unborn child\" in state criminal statutes as the period of a child's existence from fertilization until live birth. Id. at 789-90. The court stated that, prior to the legislature's statutory amendment, it had declined to extend coverage to a nonviable fetus. The court also noted that the majority of jurisdictions which have not extended coverage to a nonviable fetus, including South Carolina, have never been asked to interpret a term similar to \"unborn child\" because their wrongful death statutes have not been amended to specifically include a fetus. Id. at 790.\r\n9d The Illinois statute, enacted in 1980, provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n  The state of gestation or development of a human being when an injury is caused, when an injury takes effect, or at death, shall not foreclose maintenance of any cause of action under the law of this State arising from the death of a human being caused by wrongful act, neglect or default.\r\n\r\n740 ILCS 180/2.2 (Smith-Hurd 1993).\r\n10d MO. ANN. STAT. &sect; 1.205 (West Supp. 1996). Relying on this legislative \r\n\r\nprovision, the Supreme Court of Missouri recently held that a wrongful death action could be brought on behalf of a nonviable fetus. Connor v. Monkem Co., 898 S.W.2d 89 (Mo. 1995). In the absence of such a statute, Missouri's court had previously ruled that a fetus must be viable for an action to lie. Rambo v. Lawson, 799 S.W.2d 62 (Mo. 1990).\r\n\r\n11d MONT. CODE ANN. &sect;41-1-103 (1995). In Strezelczyk v. Jett, 870 P.2d 730 (Mont. 1994), the Supreme Court of Montana, relying on this separate legislative provision, held that a stillborn, full-term fetus would be considered a \"person\" under its wrongful death statute. It remains unclear, however, whether any fetus, regardless of viability, will be deemed covered under Montana's wrongful death act because the court stated it was reaching this result based on the particular facts of the case. Prior to the statutory addition, Montana had not allowed recovery under its wrongful death act for a stillborn fetus. See Kuhnke v. Fisher, 683 P.2d 916 (Mont. 1984), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 740 P.2d 625 (Mont. 1987).\r\n12d LA. CIV. CODE ANN. art. 26 (West 1993) (emphasis added).\r\n13d I recognize that some jurisdictions that permit a cause of action for prenatal injuries without regard to viability nevertheless maintain the viability distinction for stillbirths. 62A Am. Jur. 2d Prenatal Injuries: Wrongful Life, Birth, or Conception &sect;18 (1990). Some courts rationalize this disparity on the theory that an injury suffered any time before birth imposes conditional liability on the tortfeasor, which becomes unconditional or complete upon birth. Id. at&sect; 19. However, I believe such an approach is inequitable because death is the\r\nmost significant detractor from the potentiality of life. Why should less severe\r\ninjuries be actionable simply because the victim had the good fortune of being born alive? If a court is going to allow a cause of action for prenatal injuries suffered any time before birth, it should do so even if the injuries are severe enough to result in immediate death.\r\n\r\n14d I further note that a person's development continues even after a successful live birth. \"The respiratory system is not completed until approximately eight years of age, the reproductive system develops at puberty, and the human brain does not attain its full development until the age of sixteen.\" Nealis v.

Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for respondent:\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J.: We granted certiorari to review the en banc decision of the Court of Appeals in State v. McAteer, 333 S.C. 615, 511 S.E.2d 79 (Ct. App. 1999). We reverse and remand, and hold, consistent with the opinion authored by Judge Connor, 1that South Carolina recognizes no common law right 2 of a citizen to arrest, without a warrant, for a misdemeanor. Further, we vacate those portions of the Court of Appeals' opinions which discuss whether Driving Under the Influence (DUI) is a breach of the peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts are undisputed. An off-duty (but still uniformed) municipal police officer observed petitioner drive his automobile approximately 250 yards on a dirt road outside the municipality's city limits. The officer approached the car, and petitioner rolled down the window. The officer smelled alcohol and observed open alcoholic beverage containers in the car, and detained petitioner until a Highway patrolman arrived. The patrolman administered several field sobriety tests to petitioner, then formally arrested him and transported him to the York County Detention Center where petitioner blew a .18 on the breathalyzer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the officer was outside the municipality's city limits when he first observed petitioner, he had no police authority to detain him. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-13-40 (1985). He was authorized to arrest petitioner, however, if a private citizen could have done so. State v. Harris, 299 S.C. 157, 382 S.E.2d 925 (1989). Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-13-10 (1985), any person may arrest without a warrant:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Upon (a) view of a felony committed, (b) certain information that a felony has been committed or (c) view of a larceny committed, any person may arrest the felon or thief and !take him to a judge or magistrate, to be dealt with according to law.\r\n\r\nA second statute permits other warrantless \"citizen's arrests\" for events occurring in the nighttime. S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-13-20 (Supp. 1999). It is undisputed that petitioner's citizen's arrest occurred in the daytime and involved a misdemeanor, not a felony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt common law, a citizen could arrest for a misdemeanor committed in his presence if the misdemeanor involved a breach of the peace. We agree with the Connor opinion that, by 1833, South Carolina had limited the right of citizens to arrest to felony situations only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the issues presented here must begin with State v. Anderson, 19 S.C.L. (1 Hill) 327 (1833). Anderson killed a man in Georgia, and was hiding out in South Carolina. A party of South Carolina citizens went to arrest Anderson, who resisted. Anderson and Berry fired at each other, and Berry was mortally wounded. Anderson was subsequently captured and convicted of Berry's murder. One of the issues on appeal was the lawfulness of Berry's attempted arrest, and the Court held that a citizen may arrest a fugitive charged with a felony in a different state. Anderson at p. 138 (* 341). Further, the Court held more generally that \"private persons are permitted to arrest, where a felony has been committed, and there are reasonable grounds to suspect the party arrested to be the felon.\" Id. at p. 141 (*349).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of Anderson does not appear on the face of the opinion. Later cases relying on Anderson make clear that, at least by 1833 when it was decided, South Carolina had eliminated the common law right of a citizen to make a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor involving a breach of the peace committed in the citizen's presence.3  In State v. Davis, 50 S.C. 405, 27 S.E. 905 (1897) (Davis I),  the victim observed the defendant stealing money from the cash drawer at the victim's store. The victim chased the defendant from the store, and they scuffled. The defendant then shot the victim, who died the next day.4  At issue on appeal was the lawfulness of the victim's attempted citizen's arrest, for \"[w]hile it may be murder, under certain circumstances to kill in resisting an unlawful arrest, generally it is manslaughter only . . .\" Davis I, 29 S.E. at 913. The Court reiterated the rule that \"at common law a private person had the right to arrest, without warrant, any person who committed or attempted to commit a felony in his view\" and cited Anderson. The State failed to prove the amount of money taken from the victim's cash drawer, thus leaving open the possibility that Davis was guilty only of petit larceny, a misdemeanor. If he were guilty only of the misdemeanor, then the victim's attempted citizen's arrest was unlawful. The Court reversed and remanded since the trial judge had failed to distinguish between grand and petit larceny in charging the jury and it was therefore unclear whether they had applied the correct law in arriving at the murder verdict. It is especially instructive that the Davis I Court never mentioned the common law breach of the peace misdemeanor arrest exception, for the facts of this attempted arrest cry out for application of the rule, if it then existed.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Anderson limited the common law right to arrest to felonies only was reiterated in State v. Griffin, 74 S.C. 412, 54 S.E. 603 (1906). In Griffin, the Court stated that prior to the enactment 1866 Act No. 4802, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 an act governing citizen's arrest powers \"[T]he rule of law prevailing in this state is stated as follows, in the case of State v. Anderson . . . The proof must show prima facie a legal felony was committed, and that the prisoner was the perpetrator.\" Griffin, 74 S.C. at.604. We agree with the Connor opinion that by 1833, South Carolina's common law permitted a citizen to arrest without a warrant only for a felony, and never for misdemeanor, regardless whether the misdemeanor involved a breach of the peace. State v. Anderson, supra; State v. Davis I, supra; State v. Griffin, supra. Contrary to the Goolsby opinion, we find nothing inconsistent with this conclusion in either State v. Davis, 53 S.C. 150, 31 S.E. 62 (1898) or in State v. Byrd, 72 S.C. 104, 51 S.E. 542 (1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1865, South Carolina only permitted citizen's arrests in certain limited felony situations. State v. Anderson, supra. That year, the Legislature enacted 1865 Act No. 4731 which provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  XXIX. Upon view of a misdemeanor committed by a person of color, or by a white person toward a person of color, a Magistrate may arrest the offender . . . [.]\r\n  XXX. Upon view of a misdemeanor committed by a person of color, any person present may arrest the offender and take him before a Magistrate, to be dealt with as the case may require. In case of a misdemeanor committed by a white person toward a person of color, any person may complain to a Magistrate, who shall cause the offender to be arrested . . . [.]\r\n  XXXI. Upon view of a felony committed, or upon certain information that a felony has been committed, any person may arrest the felon . . . [.] [now Â§ 17-13-10(a) and (b)].\r\n  XXXII. In the night time, any person may be arrested by such efficient means as the darkness and the probability of his escape render necessary, even if his life should be thereby taken, in cases where he has committed a felony, or has entered a dwelling-house with evil intent, or has broken, or is breaking into an out-house, with a view to plunder, or has in his possession stolen property, or being under circumstances which raise just suspicion of his design to steal or to commit some felony, flees when he is hailed. [now Â§ 17-13-20] .\r\n\r\nIn 1866, the Legislature enacted 1866 Act No. 4802 titled An Act to Alter the [1865 Act] which repealed the 1865 Act as it related to warrantless arrests for daytime misdemeanors, and reenacted those provisions providing for warrantless daytime felony arrests now codified at Â§ 17-13-10(a) and (b), and the nighttime provisions found at Â§ 17-13-20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the Connor opinion, we conclude the 1865 Act evinces a legislative intent to regulate all warrantless arrests by private citizens, and thus to supplant the common law in this field. \"The common law remains in full force and effect in South Carolina unless changed by clear and unambiguous legislative enactment.\" Singletary v. State, 313 S.C. 75, 83, 437 S.E.2d 53, 58 (1993). With the enactment of 1865 Act No. 4731, the General Assembly clearly and unambiguously supplanted South Carolina's common law in the area of citizen's arrests by altering the felony rules and by instituting misdemeanor rules. See Branchville Motor Co. v. Adden, 158 S.C. 90, 155 S.E. 277 (1930). The fact that this Act was altered the next year to eliminate all references to misdemeanor arrests (except those in the nighttime as now found in Â§ 17-13-20) effectively restored the status quo ante 1865: no misdemeanor warrantless citizen's arrests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law changed again in 1898 when, in response to Davis I, the Legislature enacted what is now Â§ 17-13-10(c), permitting warrantless misdemeanor arrests for any \"view of a larceny committed.\" 1898 Act No. 508. The Connor opinion concludes this statute is the only circumstance when a citizen can make a daytime misdemeanor arrest. We agree. Compare Percival v. Bailey, 70 S.C. 72, 49 S.E. 7 (1904) (upholding false imprisonment verdict against private citizen who detained plaintiff for a misdemeanor); Loggins v. Southern Ry Co., 64 S.C. 321, 42 S.E. 163 (1902)(citing statute giving train conductors common law power of constables to make arrest). In Prosser v. Parsons, 245 S.C. 493, 141 S.E.2d 342 (1965), the Court in holding a game warden had statutory authority to arrest without a warrant for any offense committed in his presence, noted that \"at common law sheriffs, constables, and other peace officers had the power and authority to arrest without warrant felons or persons reasonably suspected of having committed a felony and also those who had committed a misdemeanor in his presence which amounted to a breach of the peace.\" Prosser v. Parson, 141 S.E.2d at 345. These references to the common law authority of officers to arrest for misdemeanors involving a breach of the peace committed in their presence is more evidence that no such authority was vested in private citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold there is no common law right to make warrantless citizen's arrests of any kind and that such rights as exist are created by statute in South Carolina. Accordingly, petitioner's arrest was unlawful, and his conviction is reversed and the matter remanded. Our disposition of the arrest issue makes it unnecessary to decide whether DUI involves a breach of the peace, and accordingly we vacate those portions of the Court of Appeals' opinions which discuss this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1Although four members of the Court of Appeals agreed with Judge Connor that petitioner's arrest was unlawful and therefore his conviction should be reversed, the conviction was affirmed by the vote of four to five. The Court of Appeals' en banc statute requires a vote of six judges in order to reverse. S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-8-9 0(b)(Supp. 1999). We will refer to the prevailing opinion authored by Judge Goolsby as the \"Goolsby opinion\" and to Judge Connor's opinion as the \"Connor opinion.\"  \r\n2Citizen's arrests for misdemeanors under certain circumstances are authorized by statute. e.g., S.C. Code Ann. &sect;17-13-10(c); &sect;17-13-20 (1985 and Supp. 1999).\r\n3 \"It has always been the purview of a court to change the common law. \r\n. . .\" Singletary v. State, 313 S.C.: 75, 437 S.E.2d 53 (1993). \r\n4 All events took place during daylight, making the provisions of whatis now &sect; 17-13-20 inapplicable.  \r\n5See also State v.

Emory Smith, Jr., for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        James C. Harrison, Jr., of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent is charged with misappropriating money from a mortgage closing. The full panel adopted the findings of the subpanel, and recommended a sanction of disbarment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComplainant retained respondent to handle a mortgage closing. Respondent closed the loan on June 2, 1997. On June 9, 1997, respondent's law firm's trust account received a wire transfer of $76,825.39, including at least $61,108.22 to pay off the mortgage. Respondent wrote a check payable to Fleet mortgage company in the proper amount, but rather than forwarding it to Fleet, he deposited it into an account belonging to The Gregory Company, Inc., a company he controlled. This was not a client trust account. Thereafter, on June 23, 1997, respondent wrote a check out of the Gregory Company account to Interstate/Johnson Lane for $45,384.49, with a notation on the memo line \"11,000 shares NGO 327-75660-1-8.\" By July 24, 1997, the Gregory Company account had a negative balance and complainant's mortgage had not been paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the next eight months, respondent made monthly payments to Fleet. These monthly payments were accompanied by repeated written requests for an accurate payoff amount. During this time, complainant was continually in contact with respondent concerning the unpaid loan. Respondent repeatedly told her he was waiting for an accurate payoff amount before he paid the loan. In the meantime, complainant was contacted by credit collection personnel and had difficulty obtaining a loan for another home because her Fleet mortgage remained unpaid. Complainant and her new attorney traveled from North Carolina to meet respondent and could not find him, even though he was informed of their trip in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComplainant wrote a letter dated February 17, 1998 to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct concerning respondent's misappropriation of her money. On February 21, 1998, respondent paid Fleet in full with a check for $56,536.06.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent met with Investigator George Tansil of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel in May 1998. Respondent provided Mr. Tansil with all the documents Mr. Tansil requested. Respondent told Mr. Tansil he had not misappropriated complainant's money, but had given it to Mr. Richard Brady1  to hold for complainant. Mr. Brady testified respondent gave him $50,000 to $60,000 in cash in envelopes to hold in his safe, but he was never informed the money was earmarked for a particular purpose. Furthermore, there was no accounting of the transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent admits most of the facts in evidence; however he denies some of the conclusions drawn by the panel. Specifically, he denies he gave false information to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and asserts he cooperated fully with the investigator. He further disagrees his conduct amounted to fraud or \"potentially criminal acts.\" Respondent does not contest the Office of Disciplinary Counsel established he misappropriated complainant's funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was previously suspended from the practice of law for incompetence and failure to deliver promptly funds that a client was entitled to receive. Matter of Grew, 332 S.C. 13, 503 S.E.2d 735 (1998). The sanction included remitting $1000 in undisbursed real estate closing funds to the Client Protection Fund, thirty day's suspension, and completion of the Law Office Management Assistance Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Matter of Yarborough, 327 S.C. 161, 488 S.E.2d 871 (1997). While the Court is not bound by the findings of the subpanel and full panel, their findings are entitled to great weight, particularly when the inferences to be drawn from the testimony depend on the credibility of witnesses. Id. The Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and is not bound by the panel's recommendation. Burns v. Clayton, 237 S.C. 316, 117 S.E.2d 300 (1960). The Court must administer the sanction it deems appropriate after a thorough review of the record. Matter of Kirven, 267 S.C. 669, 230 S.E.2d 899 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panel found respondent's continuing request for updated payoff statements was fraudulent and deceitful and done in an effort to postpone full payment so that his misappropriation would go uncovered. The panel also found respondent's statements concerning his giving the money to Mr. Brady for safekeeping to be false. Moreover, even if true, giving $50,000 to $60,000 in unaccounted cash to a friend to hold for a client would in itself be misconduct. See Rule 1.15, Rule 407, SCACR (client funds shall be kept in a separate trust account; complete records of such funds must be kept). The Office of Disciplinary Counsel argues respondent's conduct is in the nature of grand larceny and breach of trust with fraudulent intent. See State v. Scott, 330 S.C. 125, 130, 497 S.E.2d 735, 737 (1998) (\"Breach of trust with fraudulent intent is larceny after trust, which includes all of the elements of larceny or in common parlance, stealing, except the unlawful taking in the beginning.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panel found respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct (Rule 407, SCACR) and Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (Rule 413, SCACR):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 1.15, Rule 407, SCACR (appropriated client's funds to his own use, failed to deliver promptly to a client or third person funds that the client or person was entitled to receive, failed to render promptly a full accounting regarding property of the client or third person); 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 8.4(b) (committed potentially criminal acts that reflect adversely upon his honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 8.4(c) (engaged in conduct involving moral turpitude);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 8.4(d) (engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 3.3(a)(1) (knowingly made a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 4.1(a) (made a false statement of material fact or law to a third person);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (violated the Rules of Professional Conduct);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 8.4(e) (engaged in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 7(a)(5) &amp; (6), RLDE (violated the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law and engaged in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the panel cites Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982) for the proposition that respondent failed to cooperate with investigations of the Board in that he supplied false information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence respondent misappropriated complainant's funds is clear and convincing. Moreover, the evidence supports the conclusion respondent's conduct was intentionally fraudulent, and not merely poor judgment. Respondent's misconduct is exacerbated by his recent disciplinary history for misconduct including failure to promptly disburse client funds. Although the misappropriated monies have been fully repaid, we nevertheless conclude respondent's misconduct warrants disbarment. See Matter of Ledford, 328 S.C. 280, 494 S.E.2d 118 (1997) (eventual repayment does not excuse misappropriation of client's money). The sanction is retroactive to May 28, 1998, the date of respondent's interim suspension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Mr. Brady is a personal friend of respondent. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Respondent admits he violated Rule 1.15, but objects to the panel's conclusions concerning the remaining rule violations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
