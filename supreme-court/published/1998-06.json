Harwell assigned Judge Henry\r\nF. Floyd to dispose of all pre-trial motions and other matters arising out of\r\nthe breast implant litigation then pending, and to be subsequently filed, in\r\nthis state's court system.  In April 1995, Chief Justice Ernest A. Finney, Jr.\r\nissued an order granting permission to Judge Floyd to promulgate a Case\r\nManagement Order regulating pre-trial proceedings in the breast implant\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In November 1996, Judge Floyd issued an order addressing the\r\ndefendants' motion to dismiss the master complaint.  The circuit court\r\ndismissed certain of the causes of action in the master complaint.  Among the\r\ncauses of action not dismissed were those for strict liability, breach of implied\r\nwarranties, and breach of express warranty.1 After Plaintiffs proposed an\r\namended master complaint, adding a cause of action for the common law\r\nwarranty of soundness and quality, the defendants again moved to dismiss\r\nthe complaint.  Judge Floyd denied the motion.  The circuit court then, sua\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Other causes of action not dismissed were those for fraud and deceit,\r\nnegligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent concealment.  Causes of action\r\nfor negligence, negligent undertaking (Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 324),\r\nand medical negligence were dismissed only as to select defendants.\r\np.4\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsponte, moved to certify to this Court two questions related to the\r\napplicability of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 (1976) and Restatement (Second)\r\nof Torts Â§ 402A to Healthcare Defendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In addition, Healthcare Defendants petitioned this Court for a writ of\r\n certiorari to review Judge Floyd's orders regarding the applicability of strict\r\n liability and warranty causes of action to Healthcare Defendants.  In March\r\n 1997, we issued an order granting Healthcare Defendants'petition.  We found\r\n that there is no provision, under Rule 228(a), SCACR, for this Court to\r\n answer questions certified by a state circuit judge; however, we agreed with\r\n Judge Floyd that very important questions of law need to be answered at this\r\n time.  Accordingly, the request for certification was denied, but the petition\r\n for a writ of certiorari was granted.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Accordingly, the following questions are before us:\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. May a health care provider be held strictly liable under S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 15-73-10 for a medical device or instrument used in the course of\r\ntreating a patient?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 2. May a health care provider be held liable for the breach of implied\r\nwarranties under Article 11 of the Uniform Commercial Code with regard to\r\na medical device or instrument used in the course of treating a patient?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 3. May a health care provider be held liable for the breach of an\r\nexpress warranty under Article II of the Uniform Commercial Code with\r\nregard to a medical device or instrument used in the course of treating a\r\npatient?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Although we will not generally accept matters on a writ of certiorari\r\nthat can be entertained in the trial court or on appeal, a writ of certiorari\r\nmay be issued when exceptional circumstances exist.  This matter presents\r\nsuch a case.  Novel questions of law concerning issues of significant public\r\ninterest that are contained in numerous state and federal actions are involved\r\nin this matter.  A decision by this Court would serve the interests of judicial\r\neconomy by eliminating numerous inevitable appeals raising these issues.\r\n We reiterate that this Court will not issue a writ of certiorari merely\r\nto relieve a circuit court's burden of deciding difficult issues in high profile\r\ncases.  However, as Judge Floyd very appropriately notes, this is not only an\r\nexceptional case of great public interest, but is also one presenting novel\r\nquestions of law, which, to best serve the interests of judicial economy, should\r\nbe answered at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\np.5\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 4. May a health care provider be held liable for the breach of a common\r\nlaw warranty of soundness and quality with regard to a medical device or\r\ninstrument used in the course of treating a patient?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nA.    STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY\r\n\r\n\r\n In his November 1996 order, Judge Floyd ruled that a health care\r\nprovider may be held strictly liable under the Defective Products Act, S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 to -30 (1976). Before this Court' Healthcare Defendants\r\nargue that a health care provider cannot be held strictly liable under S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 for a medical device or instrument used in the course\r\nof treating a patient.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. SOUTH CAROLINA AUTHORITY\r\n\r\n\r\n Section 15-73-10 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n (1)   One who sells any product in a defective condition\r\n unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his\r\n property is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the\r\n ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if\r\n (a) The seller is engaged in the business of selling\r\n such a product, and\r\n (b) It is expected to and does reach the user or\r\n consumer without substantial change in the condition\r\n in which it is sold.\r\n (2) The rule stated in subsection (1) shall apply although\r\n (a) The seller has exercised all possible care in the\r\n preparation and sale of his product, and\r\n (b) The user or consumer has not bought the product\r\n from or entered into any contractual relation with the\r\n seller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10.  This provision, which was adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1974, codified, nearly verbatim, Restatement (Second)\r\nof Torts Â§ 402A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The determinative issue in this case is whether a health care provider,\r\nsuch as a hospital or physician, is a \"seller\" within the meaning of section 15-\r\n73-10.  Plaintiffs argue that section 15-73-10 does not provide an exemption\r\n\r\n\r\np.6\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor health care providers; therefore, the statute is binding upon all \"sellers,\"\r\nincluding health care providers.  They assert that unlike S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-\r\n43-10 (1985),3 which specifically exempts providers of items such as blood\r\nproducts from implied warranties of merchantability and fitness,4 no such\r\nexemption has been set forth in section 15-73-10.  'Phis is a reasonable\r\nargument based on rules of statutory construction; however, it fails to take\r\ninto account case precedent that has specifically addressed this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n South Carolina cases, as well as persuasive authority from other\r\njurisdictions, dictate that health care providers are not \"sellers\" under\r\nRestatement Â§ 402A. DeLoach v. Whitney, 275 S.C. 543, 273 S.E.2d 768\r\n(1981) provides the analytic starting point for answering the question before\r\nus. In DeLoach, the plaintiff had won four of defendant's tires in a raffle.\r\nThe defendant installed these tires on plaintiff s car.  During the installation,\r\na deteriorated valve stem, not a part of the tire, was left on the wheel.  Some\r\ntime later, the valve stem ruptured while the car was being driven, causing\r\nthe car to go off the road, thereby injuring plaintiff.  The plaintiff brought an\r\naction against the defendant under strict tort liability.  The defendant moved\r\nfor a directed verdict on the issue of strict liability, arguing there had been\r\nno sale to bring the transaction within section 15-73-10.  The trial court\r\ndenied the motion, finding services to be included within the scope of section\r\n15-73-10.  We disagreed.  Thus, DeLoach held that services are not included\r\nwithin the scope of section 15-73-10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n However, DeLoach also contains language which rejects the argument\r\nthat strict liability includes the negligent installation of a non-defective\r\nproduct.  Thus, the opinion is not entirely clear whether it was deciding that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 S.C. Code A-nn. Â§ 44-43-10 provides: \r\n\r\n The implied warranties of merchantability and fitness shall not\r\n be applicable to a contract for the sale, procurement, processing,\r\n distribution or use of human tissues such as corneas, bones or\r\n organs, whole blood, plasma, blood products or blood derivatives.\r\n Such human tissues, whole blood, plasma, blood products or blood\r\n derivatives shall not be considered commodities subject to sale or\r\n barter and the transplanting, injection, transfusion or other\r\n transfer of such substances into the human body shall be\r\n considered a medical service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 4 See Samson v. Greenville Hosp.  Sys., 295 S.C. 359, 368 S.E.2d 665\r\n(1988).\r\n\r\n\r\np.7\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices generally were excluded from the scope of section 15-73-10, or\r\nwhether just negligent services provided in connection with non-defective\r\nproducts were excluded from section 15-73-10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n This question was clarified by Samson v. Greenville Hospital System,\r\n297 S.C. 409, 377 S.E.2d 311 (1989), wherein we explicitly stated that section\r\n15-73-10 did not apply to services.  Citing DeLoach, we declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 (1976), which is based on\r\nSection 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, imposes strict\r\nliability in tort upon the suppliers of defective products. This\r\nsection applies only to products and not to services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamson, 297 S.C. at 410, 377 S.E.2d at 311 (emphasis added).  The issue in\r\nSamson was whether blood was a product or service under section 15-73-10.\r\nWe found that the Legislature did not intend for blood to be classified as a\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Thus, when analyzed together, DeLoach and Samson teach that\r\n providers of services may not be held liable under section 15-73-10.  The\r\n pivotal question then, in this case, is whether health care providers, including\r\n those who perform breast implant procedures, offer services or products.  In\r\n analyzing this question, we must consider whether the essence of the\r\n transaction is the provision of a service or a product.  We hold that health\r\n care providers who perform breast implant procedures are, in essence,\r\n providing a service.  Although the breast implant procedure requires the use\r\n of a product, the implant, the health care provider is fundamentally and\r\n predominantly offering a service.  The provider must have medical knowledge\r\n and skill to conduct the procedure.  He must advise the patient of the\r\n medical consequences and must recommend to the patient the preferable type\r\n of procedure.  The product may not be purchased independently of the\r\n service.  One does not \"buy\" a breast implant procedure in the same way as\r\n one would buy a product, such as a lawn-mower.  At its heart, the breast\r\n implant procedure is a service and not a product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Case law from other jurisdictions supports the product/service\r\ndistinction delineated in South Carolina cases: \"In general, the courts have\r\nrefused to apply the concept of strict liability in tort to a person rendering\r\nprofessional or nonprofessional services, where injury occurs through a\r\ndefective product used by the person rendering such services, or as a result\r\nof allegedly defective services themselves.\"     American Law of Products\r\nLiability Â§ 1:77, at 84 (T. Travers ed., 3d ed. 1987).  Some jurisdictions have\r\n\r\n\r\np.8\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\nspecifically addressed the issue of whether health care providers may be held\r\nstrictly liable under products liability law.  An overwhelming majority of\r\ncourts have responded in the negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n A number of courts have set forth thoughtful analyses of the view that\r\nhealth care professionals and institutions are providers of services, rather\r\nthan sellers of products, for purposes of strict liability in tort.  The following\r\nis a sample of leading cases that have discussed the applicability of products\r\nliability standards to the health care industry:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In Hector v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 225 Cal.  Rptr. 595 (Cal.  Ct.\r\nApp. 1986), it was held that a hospital was not strictly liable for implantation\r\nof a defective pacemaker.  The California Court of Appeals wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essence of the relationship between hospital and patient is\r\nthe provision of professional medical services necessary to effect\r\nthe implantation of the pacemaker -- the patient does not enter\r\nthe hospital merely to purchase a pacemaker but to obtain a\r\ncourse of treatment which includes implantation of a pacemaker.\r\n. . .As a provider of services rather than a seller of a product,\r\nthe hospital is not subject to strict liability for a defective product\r\nprovided to the patient during the course of his or her treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHector, 225 Cal.  Rptr. at 599-600.\r\n\r\n\r\n More recently, in Cafazzo v. Central Medical Health Services, Inc., 668\r\nA.2d 521 (Pa. 1995), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in a case of first\r\nimpression, decided that hospitals and physicians cannot be held subject to\r\nstrict liability under the Restatement Â§ 402A for- defects in a product\r\nincidental to the provision of medical services.  The court wrote that the\r\nprovision of medical services is to be regarded as qualitatively different from\r\nthe sale of products.  The case posited that the thrust of the inquiry is not\r\nwhether a separate consideration is charged for the products used in the\r\nexercise of medical skill, but what service is performed to restore or maintain\r\nthe patient's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In Ayyash v. Henry Ford Health Systems, 533 N.W.2d 353 (Mich.  Ct.\r\nApp. 1995), appeal denied, 549 N.W.2d 561 (Mich. 1996), the Michigan Court\r\nof Appeals declined to impose strict products liability on health care providers\r\nfor temporomandibular joint implants.  The court stated that because the\r\nprimary function of physicians and hospitals is to provide care, not to\r\nmanufacture or distribute products, those economic theories that underlie the\r\n\r\n\r\np.9\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimposition of strict liability upon makers and sellers of products (e.g.\r\nspreading the risk, redistribution of wealth, and problems of proof and\r\ndeterrence) do not justify the extension of strict liability to medical service\r\n providers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Porter v. Rosenberg, 650 So.2d 79 (Fla.  Ct.  App. 4th Dist.), rev. denied,\r\n661 So.2d 825 (Fla. 1995) addressed the situation where the medical product\r\nwas a breast implant.  The Florida court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs\r\nstrict liability claim against a physician for an allegedly defective breast\r\nimplant.  The court found that strict liability was not applicable to an action\r\nagainst a physician who supplies a product to a patient where the medical\r\nservices could not have been rendered without using the product and where\r\nthe predominant purpose of the transaction was the provision of medical\r\nservices.  Porter stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysicians, like hospitals, are providers of medical services.  The\r\nphysician's expertise lies in the diagnosis, treatment and cure of\r\nillness, not in the research or development of prosthetics or\r\ndevices used to aid medical diagnosis or treatment.  A physician\r\nis not in the business of selling products, but rather is in the\r\nprofession of providing medical services.  Products such as the\r\nprosthetic device in this case are supplied and utilized only as\r\nneeded to deliver the professional medical service.  They are\r\nincidental, or integral, to a physician's service, but they are not\r\nthe focus of the physician's delivery of health care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPorter, 650 So.2d at 81-82 (quoting Cafazzo v. Central Med.  Health Servs.\r\nInc., 635 A.2d 151, 154 (Pa.  Super.  Ct. 1993)).  The court further stated that\r\n\"even with a product, such as a breast implant, a physician is exercising his\r\nor her professional judgment in determining what medical procedure to\r\nperform and then in selecting the appropriate product to utilize in connection\r\nwith the procedure.  The provision of the product is integrally related to the\r\nprofessional services and skill offered by the medical care provider.\" Id. at\r\n82.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Weissman v. Dow Coming Corporation, 892 F. Supp. 510 (S.D.N.Y.\r\n1995) also addressed breast implant procedures.  Weissman, which involved\r\na claim against a physician, among others, for injuries caused by a silicone\r\nbreast implant procedure, declared that there is not a difference between\r\n\"health\" care and elective, cosmetic procedures.  The fact that the plaintiff\r\nwas or was not intended to be \"healed\" by the medical service had little, if\r\nany, legal significance.  Moreover, the type of medical services provided does\r\n\r\n\r\np.10\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LTTIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot transform what is primarily a service into the sale of a product.\r\nWeissman, 892 F. Supp. at 517.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A significant number of other jurisdictions have also reached the\r\n conclusion that strict liability should not be impose'd upon health care\r\n providers.    See Hoff v. Zimmer, Inc., 746 F. Supp. 872 (W.D. Wis.\r\n 1990)(under Wisconsin law, hospital could not be held strictly liable for\r\n patient's injuries suffered as a result of a defective hip prosthesis); NME\r\n Hospitals, Inc. v. Azzariti, 573 So.2d 173 (Fla.  Ct.  App. 2d Dist.\r\n 1991)(hospital that utilizes an allegedly defective product only in the course\r\n of its primary function of providing medical services is not subject to an\r\n action in strict liability where the professional services could not have been\r\n rendered without using the product); North Miami General Hosp., Inc. v.\r\n Goldberg, 520 So.2d 650 (Fla.  Ct.  App. 3d Dist. 1988)(no strict liability claim\r\n lies against a hospital where patient sustained burns on her body from\r\n electro-surgical grounding pad used during surgery); Magrine v. Krasnica, 227\r\n A.2d 539 (N.J. County Ct. 1967)(dentist not strictly liable for injuries caused\r\n by the breaking, in plaintiffs jaw, of a hypodermic needle used during an\r\n injection procedure), aff'd, 250 A.2d 129 (N.J. 1969); Parker v. St. Vincent\r\n Hospital, 919 P.2d 1104 (N.M. Ct.  App. 1996)(rejecting, on the basis of policy\r\n grounds, the imposition of strict liability on hospitals for defectively designed\r\n medical products); Probst v. Albert Einstein Medical Center, 440 N.Y.S.2d 2\r\n (N.Y. App.  Div. 1981)(hospital not strictly liable for defective spinal rod\r\n broken after surgical implantation); Nevauex v. Park Place Hosp., Inc., 656\r\n S.W.2d 923 (Tex.  Ct.  App. 1983)(hospital not liable under strict liability\r\n because radiation supplied was a service, not a product, and strict liability\r\n applies to defective products, not services).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n There is very little authority to support finding health care providers\r\nstrictly liable under products liability law.  In Bell v. Poplar Bluff Physicians\r\nGroup, Inc., 879 S.W.2d 618 (Mo.  Ct.  App. 1994), the Missouri Court of\r\nAppeals declared that the sale of a product is not required to bring an action\r\nfor strict liability.  Liability is imposed on those placing a product in the\r\nstream of commerce, and the product need not be sold if it has been placed\r\nin the stream of commerce by other means.  Thus, it was held that a hospital\r\ncould be lield strictly liable under products liability law for a defective\r\ntemporomandibular implant.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 There has been temporomandibular joint (\"TMJ\") implant litigation\r\nacross the country, much like breast implant litigation.  Contrary to Bell,\r\nother cases have followed the general proposition that health care providers\r\nshould not be held strictly liable for TMJ implants.\r\n\r\n\r\np.11\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Plaintiffs point to four other cases in support of their position.  These\r\n cases, however, are either unpersuasive or no longer good law.  The plaintiffs\r\n cite Cunningham v. MacNeal Memorial Hospital, 266 N.E.2d 897 (Ill. 1970),\r\n which held that a hospital supplying contaminated blood was strictly liable\r\n because it engaged in the business of selling blood for transfusion into\r\n patients.  This decision has been superseded by statute.  See Advincula v.\r\n United Blood Services, 654 N.E.2d 644 (111.  Ct.  App. 1995).  Further,\r\n reference is made to Porter v. Rosenberg, 650 So.2d 79 (Fla.  Ct.  App. 4th\r\n Dist. 1995).  Although this case contains some language favoring Plaintiffs,\r\n it clearly reached, as discussed earlier, the opposite conclusion, namely, that\r\n a physician may not be held strictly liable for a defective breast implant.\r\n Also, Branch v. Willis-Knighton Medical Center, 636 So.2d 211 (La. 1994),\r\n which allowed to go forward an action for strict products liability for\r\n contaminated blood, was principally concerned with procedural issues, such\r\n as the statute of limitation, and did not clearly address the merits.  Finally,\r\n Plaintiffs cite Karibjanian v. Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, 717 F.\r\n Supp. 1081 (E.D. Pa. 1989). Applying Pennsylvania law,  the federal district\r\n court held that a hospital could be held strictly liable under Restatement Â§\r\n 402A for the use of contrast media (chemical injection).  However, in light of\r\n the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's rejection of strict liability claims in\r\n Cafazzo, 668 A.2d 521 (Pa. 1995), Karibjanian would appear to be essentially\r\n overruled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Thus, we hold that health care providers may not be held strictly liable,\r\nunder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10, for products used in the course of providing\r\nmedical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

Â§ 36-2-313 (1976): \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n (a) Any affirmation of fact or promise, including\r\n those on containers or labels, made by the seller to\r\n the buyer, whether directly or indirectly, which\r\n relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of\r\n the bargain creates an express warranty that the\r\n\r\n\r\np.12\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST TMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwarranty of fitness for a particular purpose.8\r\n\r\ngoods conform to the affirmation or promise.\r\n (b) Any description of the goods which is made part\r\n of the basis of the bargain creates an express\r\n warranty that the goods shall conform to the\r\n description.\r\n (c) Any sample or model which is made part of the\r\n basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that\r\n the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or\r\n model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty\r\nthat the seller use formal words such as \"warrant\" or \"guarantee\"\r\nor that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an\r\naffirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement\r\npurporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of\r\nthe goods does not create a warranty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-314 (1976):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Unless excluded or modified (Â§ 36-2-316), a warranty that the\r\ngoods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale\r\nif the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\r\nUnder this section the serving for value of food or drink to be\r\nconsumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as\r\n\r\n\r\n (a) pass without objection in the trade under the\r\n contract description; and\r\n (b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average\r\n quality within the description; and\r\n (c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such\r\n goods are used; and\r\n (d) run, within the variations permitted by the\r\n agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within\r\n each unit and among all units involved; and\r\n (e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled\r\n as the agreement may require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) Unless excluded or modified (Â§ 36-2-316) other implied\r\nwarranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.13\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Article II of the U.C.C. applies only to transactions in goods.  Section\r\n36-2-103 (1976) defines \"seller\" as \"a person who sells or contracts to sell\r\ngoods.\" \"The Code warranty provisions do not govern contracts which are\r\npurely for services.\" 1 James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform\r\nConunercial Code 479 (4th ed. 1995).  The South Carolina Court of Appeals\r\nhas recognized that in this state, a sale must occur before an implied\r\nwarranty can arise. Priest v. Brown, 302 S.C. 405, 396 S.E.2d 638 (Ct.  App.\r\n1990).  Further, it has been observed that the U.C.C.'s implied warranty\r\nappears.  \"inapplicable to services.\" F. Patrick Hubbard &amp; Robert L. Felix,\r\nSouth Carolina Law of Torts 262 (2d 1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Our conclusion above -- that health care providers offer services, not\r\nproducts -- determines our holding as to the issues of warranty under Article\r\nII of the U.C.C. Cases from other jurisdictions have similarly disallowed\r\nsuch claims.  See In re: TMJ Implants Products Liability Litigation, 872 F.\r\nSupp. 1019 (D.  Minn. 1995)(physician who installed temporomandibular joint\r\nimplant could not, under North Carolina law, be liable under U.C.C. breach\r\nof warranty theories); Cook v. Downing, 891 P.2d 611 (Okla.  Ct.  App.\r\n1994)(dentist was not a \"merchant,\" and \"dentures\" were not \"goods\" under\r\nthe U.C.C.); Pitler v. Michael Reese Hosp., 415 N.E.2d 1255 (Ill.  Ct.  App.\r\n1980)(U.C.C. did not apply to radiation treatments).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Finally, Healthcare Defendants argue that the lower court erred in\r\nfailing to dismiss Plaintiff's common law warranty of soundness and quality\r\nclaim.  We agree.  Plaintiff's have not identified any South Carolina authority\r\nthat has recognized a common law warranty of soundness and quality, within\r\nthe medical context; nor are we aware of any.  Therefore, this cause of action\r\nshould be dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n Based on the foregoing, we hold that health care providers are not\r\nstrictly liable under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 for medical devices or\r\n\r\n8 See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-315 (1976): \r\n\r\n Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know\r\n any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that\r\n the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or\r\n furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under\r\n the next section (Â§ 36-2-316) an implied warranty that the goods\r\n shall be fit for such purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\np.14\r\n\r\nIN RE: BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstruments used in the course of treatment of patients.  Further, we hold\r\nthat health care providers may not be found liable under Article II\r\nwarranties or a conunon law warranty of soundness and quality.

Groves, Sr., and Stephen L. Brown,\r\nboth of Young, Clement, Rivers &amp; Tisdale, L.L.P., of\r\nCharleston; and Reese 1.

Gray, of Moncks\r\nCorner, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n MOORE, A.J.: Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review\r\nthe Court of Appeals' decision in State v. Bacote, Op.  No. 97-UP-105 (S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\np.16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Bacote \r\n\r\nCt. App. filed February 6, 1997).  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n After petitioner was arrested for driving under the influence\r\n(DUI) on June 26, 1994, he refused to take the breathalyzer test.  He\r\nrequested an administrative hearing from the South Carolina Department\r\nof Public Safety (SCDPS) to determine whether his license should be\r\nautomatically suspended under the implied consent statute, S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 56-5-2950 (Supp. 1996).  Because the arresting officer did not\r\nappear at the administrative hearing, the hearing officer rescinded\r\npetitioner's automatic suspension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Prior to petitioner's DUI trial, petitioner moved to suppress\r\nevidence regarding his refusal to take the breathalyzer test.  The trial\r\njudge ruled collateral estoppel applied and held evidence petitioner refused\r\nthe breathalyzer should be suppressed based upon the administrative\r\nhearing and subsequent dismissal of the automatic suspension.  The State\r\nimmediately appealed.  The Court of Appeals reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding the trial\r\njudge erroneously suppressed petitioner's refusal\r\nto take the breathalyzer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n Under Â§ 56-5-2950, a defendant may request a hearing to\r\ndetermine whether the defendant was placed under arrest, was info=ed\r\nthat he could refuse the test whereupon his driving privileges would be\r\nsuspended, and actually refused to take the test.  If a hearing is requested\r\nthe ninety-day suspension does not begin until after the hearing and the\r\nsuspension is sustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Court of Appeals relied upon its decision in Shelton v.\r\nOscar Mayer Foods Corp., 319 S.C. 81, 459 S.E.2d 851 (Ct.  App. 1995),\r\nand held collateral estoppel did not apply to administrative hearings held\r\npursuant Â§ 56-5-2950.  In Shelton, the issue was whether an\r\nadministrative finding of the Employment Security Commission (ESC) was\r\n\r\n\r\np.17\r\n\r\nState v. Bacote \r\n\r\nbinding in the employee's subsequent wrongful termination suit.  Based\r\nupon the limited nature of the ESC's hearing, the Court of Appeals held\r\nthe ESC's findings were not binding.  We reviewed the Court of Appeals'\r\ndecision in Shelton and affirmed. Shelton v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp ,\r\n325 S.C. 248, 481 S.E.2d 706 (1997).  We agreed the nature of the ESC's\r\nhearing was limited and the ESC's findings should not be used as\r\ncollateral estoppel in a subsequent civil action.  In Shelton, we held if an\r\nissue decided at the ESC hearing could be used against an employer in a\r\nsubsequent action, the hearing would become a full-blown trial on the\r\nissue of termination defeating the purpose which is to quickly provide an\r\nunemployed person some income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We have previously adopted the general rule of collateral\r\nestoppel as set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments Â§ 27 (1982)\r\nin South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas.  Ins.  Guar.  Ass'n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\r\n304 S.C. 210, 403 S.E.2d 625 (1991).  Section 27 states: \"When an issue of\r\nfact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final\r\njudgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the\r\ndetermination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties,\r\nwhether on the same or different claim.\" See also Palm v. General\r\nPainting Co., Inc., 302 S.C. 372, 396 S.E.2d 361 (1990)(citations\r\nomitted)(\"Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, . . . the second action\r\nis based upon a different claim and the judgment in the first action\r\nprecludes relitigation of only those issues actually and necessarily litigated\r\nin the first suit.\"').\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In the context of a default judgment, collateral estoppel or\r\nissue preclusion does not apply because an essential element of that\r\ndoctrine requires that the claim sought to be precluded actually have been\r\nlitigated in the earlier litigation. 50 C.J.S Judgments Â§ 797 (1997).  Thus,\r\nhere, the license revocation hearing would not preclude the introduction of\r\nevidence regarding petitioner's refusal to take the breathalyzer because the\r\nissue was never actually litigated in the administrative proceeding. See\r\nState v. Lewry, 550 A.2d 64 (Me. 1988)(order entered by default in license\r\nsuspension proceeding has no collateral effect in prosecution for DUI since\r\nthe order was not the result of actual litigation on the issue on the\r\nmerits); State v. Purvis, 739 S.W.2d 589 (Mo.App. 1987)(to be barred by\r\ncollateral estoppel an issue must have been actually litigated as\r\ndistinguished from a judgment rendered upon some preliminary or\r\ntechnical point, or by default and without trial).\r\n\r\n\r\np.18\r\n\r\nState v. Bacote \r\n\r\n Even had the issue actually been litigated, we hold collateral\r\nestoppel does not apply to issues decided at administrative hearings held\r\npursuant to Â§ 56-5-2950.  The doctrine of collateral estoppel is intended to\r\nreduce litigation and conserve the resources of the court and litigants and\r\nit is based upon the notion that it is unfair to permit a party to relitigate\r\nan issue that has already been decided.  Since it is grounded upon\r\nconcepts of fairness, it should not be rigidly or mechanically applied. In re\r\nJuan C., 89 N.Y.2d 659, 679 N.E.2d 1061, 657 N.Y.S.2d 581 (1997).  See\r\nalso 50 C.J.S. Judgments Â§ 779 (1997).  Thus, even if all the requirements\r\nof issue preclusion are met, when unfairness or injustice results or public\r\npolicy requires it, the doctrine's application may be precluded. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Section 28 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments (1982),\r\nwhich we also adopted in South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas.  Ins.  Guar.  Ass'n. v.\r\nWal-Mart Stores, supra, provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough an issue is actually litigated and determined\r\nby a valid and final judgment, and the determination\r\nis essential to the judgment, relitigation of the issue\r\nin a subsequent action between the parties is not\r\nprecluded in the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) A new determination of the issue is warranted\r\nby differences in the quality or extensiveness of\r\nthe procedures followed in the two courts or by\r\nfactors relating to the allocation of jurisdiction\r\nbetween them   .  .  .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) There is a clear and convincing need for a new\r\ndetermination of the issue (a) because of the potential\r\nadverse impact of the determination on the public\r\ninterest or the interests of persons not themselves\r\nparties in the initial action, (b) because it was not\r\nsufficiently foreseeable at the time of the initial\r\naction that the issue would arise in the context\r\nof a subsequent action, or (c) because the party\r\nsought to be precluded, as a result of the\r\nconduct of the adversary or other special\r\ncircumstances, did not have an adequate\r\nopportunity or incentive to obtain a full and\r\nfair adjudication in the initial action.\r\n\r\n\r\np.19\r\n\r\nState v. Bacote \r\n\r\n In State v. Williams, 76 Ohio St.3d 290, 667 N.E.2d 932\r\n(1996), the Ohio Supreme Court held that pursuant to Â§ 28 (3) and (5) of\r\nthe Restatement, an administrative license revocation proceeding does not\r\npreclude litigation of the same issue in a criminal prosecution.  The court\r\npointed out the limited nature of the administrative proceeding and its\r\ninformality and also relied upon the adverse impact that collateral\r\nestoppel would have in the criminal proceedings if it were allowed (i.e. the\r\nState would be forced to treat the administrative hearing as an initial and\r\nessential part of the criminal trial).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Other jurisdictions have similarly held the state does not have\r\na full and fair opportunity to litigate issues during a license revocation\r\nproceeding, and it would be unfair to preclude the state from litigating\r\nsuch issues during a subsequent criminal trial.  See People v. Moore, 138\r\nIll.2d 162, 561 N.E.2d 648 (1990); People v. Lalka, 113 Misc.2d 474, 449\r\nN.Y.S.2d 579 (1982).  We agree with the reasoning applied in these cases.\r\nThe summary nature of the typical license revocation hearing makes\r\ndeterminations from such a hearing inappropriate for the application of\r\ncollateral estoppel. Moore, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Moreover, if every license revocation hearing carries with it\r\npotential collateral estoppel impact on a subsequent criminal action, the\r\nState may feel compelled to intervene in every administrative action to\r\neffectively protect its interests in some future criminal proceeding.  The\r\nnet effect would be to slow down what should be a summary\r\nadministrative proceeding designed to handle license revocation matters\r\nquickly.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' decision is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24795","title":"Simmons v.

His convictions and sentences were\r\naffirmed on direct appeal. State v. Simmons, Op.  No. 87-MO-276 (S.C.\r\nSup.  Ct. filed June 8, 1987).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Petitioner filed an application for PCR alleging ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel.  At the PCR hearing, petitioner specifically claimed\r\ntrial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to and move for a mistrial\r\nbecause of improper and inflammatory jury arguments by the solicitor and\r\nthe solicitor's jury argument of matters outside the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solicitor made the following comments during his closing \r\nargument:\r\n\r\n\r\n He might have had plans to case that house, get an idea\r\n everything that was there and was going to take it on the way\r\n out.  He had something else in mind.  He had something evil\r\n on his mind.  He went in, it was obvious the people were\r\n upstairs.  He knew exactly what he wanted.  He saw Mrs.\r\n Lewis sleeping in her bed in the darkness, exactly what he\r\n wanted .  .  .  .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the form of the verdict in a burglary case, everybody\r\nknows, realize in a criminal case there is just two verdicts:\r\nguilty or not guilty.  In burglary, it is a little bit different.\r\nThere is what they call special verdicts.  You have two forms\r\nof guilty in a burglary case.  One is guilty and the other is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Petitioner committed the crimes prior to the amendment of the\r\nburglary statute which eliminated the provision that absent a\r\nrecommendation of mercy by the jury, the sentence for burglary was a\r\nmandatory term of life imprisonment.  Compare S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-\r\n310 (1985) with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Supp. 1997).\r\n\r\n\r\np.22\r\n\r\nSIMMONS v. STATE \r\n\r\nguilty with a recommendation for mercy.  The difference\r\nbetween the two is the basis for sentencing.  They say that for\r\na guilty burglary without a recommendation for mercy, that\r\ncarries a life sentence.  Why do they call it a life sentence,\r\nwhen it is not the entire natural life of a person.  Not that.  It\r\nis a heavier sentence than recommendation for mercy.  That is\r\nthe basic difference.  Guilty with mercy carries a lighter\r\nsentence ....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real choice in this case is going to be do we find him\r\nguilty of burglary or do we recommend mercy?   .  .  .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich are you going to apply for our home, the New York\r\nstandard or the South Carolina standard?  In New York, just a\r\nburglary, so what, give him mercy.  South Carolina the\r\nstandard should be clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Trial counsel failed to object to any of these statements.\r\nDuring the PCR hearing, trial counsel offered no reason for his failure to\r\nobject, although trial counsel admitted he probably should have objected to\r\nsome of the statements because the solicitor misstated the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The PCR judge found the statements, while perhaps improper,\r\nharmless when considered in the context of the whole trial because \"there\r\nwas enough evidence in the record to convict the [petitioner], thereby\r\nproviding a reasonable probability that the jury verdict would not have\r\nbeen different absent the solicitor's statements.\" According to the PCR\r\njudge, the trial judge adequately cured any prejudice created by the\r\nsolicitor's statement regarding a life sentence not being a full natural life\r\nby explaining to the jury that the trial judge was responsible for\r\nsentencing.  Further, the PCR judge found the \"real choice\" argument and\r\nthe \"New York\" argument, when read in context, were merely\r\ninformational and not prejudicial.  The PCR judge failed to rule on the\r\nstatements concerning petitioner's intent to rape Mrs. Lewis which\r\npetitioner claimed was improper because no facts in the record supported\r\nthis argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err in failing to find trial counsel ineffective\r\nfor failing to object to portions of the solicitor's closing\r\n\r\n\r\np.23\r\n\r\nSIMMONS v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Petitioner contends the PCR judge erred in failing to find trial\r\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to object to the portions of the solicitor's\r\nclosing argument concerning the meaning of a life sentence and the \"real\r\nchoice\" available to the jury.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The burden is on the applicant in a post-conviction proceeding\r\nto prove the allegations in his application. Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441,\r\n334 S.E.2d 813 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1094, 106 S.Ct. 869, 88\r\nL.Ed.2d 908 (1986).  As to allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel,\r\nthe applicant must show his counsel's performance fell below an objective\r\nstandard of reasonableness, and but for counsel's errors, there is a\r\nreasonable probability the result at trial would have been different.\r\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668p 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674\r\n(1984); Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182p 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).  A\r\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\r\nin the outcome of the trial. Johnson v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A solicitor's closing argument must not appeal to the personal\r\nbiases of the jurors nor be calculated to arouse the jurors' passions or\r\nprejudices, and its content should stay within the record and reasonable\r\ninferences to it. State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 S.E.2d 620 (1996).\r\nImproper comments do not automatically require reversal if they are not\r\nprejudicial to the defendant. Johnson v. State, supra; 3 Wharton's\r\nCriminal Procedure Â§ 353 (13th ed. 1991) (question is whether comment\r\nwas sufficiently prejudicial or harmless).  On appeal, the appellate court\r\nwill view the alleged impropriety of the solicitor's argument in the context\r\nof the. entire record, including whether the trial judge's instructions\r\nadequately cured the improper argument and whether there is\r\noverwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt. Johnson v. State, supra (a\r\nsolicitor's improper comments may be cured by the judge's instructions to\r\nthe jury); State v. Copeland, supra; United States v. Wilson, 135 F.3d 291\r\n(4th Cir. 1998).  The appellant has the burden of proving he did not\r\nreceive a fair trial because of the alleged improper argument. State v.\r\nJohnson, supra; State v. Copeland, supra.  The relevant question is\r\nwhether the solicitor's comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to\r\nmake the resulting conviction a denial of due process. Donnelly v.\r\nDeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974); State v.\r\n\r\n\r\np.24\r\n\r\nSIMMONS v. STATE \r\n\r\nPatterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760, cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 118 S.Ct.\r\n146, 139 L.Ed.2d 92 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The solicitor misstated the law in his closing argument by\r\nimproperly injecting parole considerations into the jury's sentencing\r\ndecision and equating a finding of guilty with a recommendation of mercy\r\nwith a much lighter sentence or an acquittal. See State v. Brooks, 271\r\nS.C. 355, 247 S.E.2d 436 (1978) (a jury should not be invited nor\r\npermitted to speculate about the possible effects of parole upon a\r\nconviction).  In State v. Hinton, 210 S.C. 480, 4881, 43 S.E.2d 360, 363\r\n(1947), this Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNor can we find any justification for the argument that if the\r\ndefendants were found guilty of murder, but recommended to\r\nlife imprisonment, that this would not necessarily mean that\r\nthey would serve a life sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n It would appear that the only logical inference to be\r\ndrawn from such an argument is that, in a case like the one\r\nbefore us, all elements of mercy and extenuating circumstances\r\nshould be put aside, even if present, because the only certainty\r\nof adequate punishment would be a sentence of guilty without\r\nrecommendation to mercy.  In other words, a verdict of murder\r\nshould be rendered because some other department of the state\r\ngovernment might shorten or commute a life sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In Hinton, the Court found the solicitor's improper argument\r\nprobably affected the verdict.  Further, the instructions given by the trial\r\njudge to the jury to disregard the solicitor's improper comments did not\r\ncure the prejudice caused by these remarks; therefore, the defendant was\r\nentitled to a new trial. Id. Compare with State v. Gilstrap, 205 S.C. 412,\r\n32 S.E.2d 163 (1944) (evidence of guilt was overwhelming and the\r\ninstruction was adequate to cure the improper argument; thus, the\r\ndefendant was not prejudiced).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Here, the trial judge's instructions to the jury did not correct\r\nthe solicitor's misstatements concerning the consequences of the burglary\r\nconviction.  The trial judge informed the jury that the sentencing\r\nresponsibility was exclusively his, and he discussed the three forms of\r\nverdict available to the jury for the burglary charge.  No explanation of\r\nthe sentencing consequences for a verdict of guilty and for a verdict of\r\n\r\n\r\np.25\r\n\r\nSIMMONS v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n guilty with a recommendation of mercy were provided to the jury. See\r\n State v. Plath, 277 S.C. 126, 284 S.E.2d 221 (1981), appeal after remand,\r\n 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619, cert. denied by Arnold v. South Carolina, 467\r\n U.S. 1265, 104 S.Ct. 3560, 82 L.Ed.2d 862 (1984), overruled on other\r\n grounds by State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d 202 (1998) (any\r\n prejudice from reference to parole in argument was cured by trial judge's\r\n jury instruction); State v. McGee, 268 S.C. 618, 235 S.E.2d 715 (1977)\r\n (where the right to fix the punishment or make a recommendation with\r\n regard to punishment rests with the jury, the consequences of a conviction\r\n should be provided to the jury).  Thus, no jury instructions cured the\r\n solicitor's improper argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n The evidence of petitioner's guilt is overwhelming.2 However,\r\n because the issue is whether the solicitor's improper argument prevented\r\n the jury from fairly considering the guilty with a recommendation of mercy\r\n verdict, the overwhelming evidence of petitioner's guilt does not eliminate\r\n the reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been\r\n different had trial counsel objected to portions of the solicitor's closing\r\n argument. See. State v. McGee, 268 S.C. 618, 235 S.E.2d 715 (1977)\r\n (where this Court found the trial judge erred by refusing to instruct the\r\n jury as to the penalty for the crime of burglary and by preventing the jury\r\n from determining, as the statute requires, whether to recommend mercy,\r\n and further finding this type of error could not be considered harmless\r\n because the recommendation of the jury is an important part of the verdict\r\n and without proper instructions, the probability of prejudice is great); see\r\n also State v. White, 246 S.C. 502, 144 S.E.2d 481 (1965) (finding where\r\n the jury had absolute discretion with regard to the issue of mercy, it was\r\n impossible to determine whether the solicitor's improper argument actually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Mrs. Lewis testified she got a good look at the intruder and gave a\r\ncomplete description to the police.  Mrs. Lewis positively identified\r\npetitioner as the intruder at a subsequent photographic lineup and again\r\nat trial.  Mr. Lewis was able to stab the intruder in the chest prior to the\r\nintruder's escape.  Police were notified that someone had called for an\r\nambulance from 4106 Glendon Street in Richland County, but later\r\ncanceled the request.  A police officer investigated the call by going to the\r\naddress.  The police officer found petitioner at that address and he had a\r\nfresh wound to the center of his chest.  Bloody clothing was found at the\r\naddress.  Further, a shoe tassel matching the one found at the victims'\r\nresidence belonged to petitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\np.26\r\n\r\nSIMMONS v. STATE \r\n\r\nprejudiced defendant; however, the probability of prejudice was great, and\r\ndefendant was entitled to a new trial).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The solicitor's improper comments prevented petitioner from\r\nhaving the jury fairly consider the possible sentencing alternatives.\r\nFurther, the jury instructions failed to cure the prejudice caused by these\r\ncomments.  Thus, because the probability for prejudice is great, we grant\r\npetitioner a new trial on the burglary charge. See Chubb v. State, 303\r\nS.C. 395, 401 S.E.2d 159 (1991) (holding because determination of guilt\r\nand whether mercy should be recommended should be made in one\r\nproceeding by the same jury, petitioner is entitled to a new trial on the\r\nburglary charge).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n As to the portion of the closing argument concerning\r\npetitioner's intent to rape Mrs. Lewis, which petitioner claims was\r\nimproper because no facts in the record supported this argument, the\r\nfailure of trial counsel to object was not ruled on by the PCR judge and,\r\naccordingly, is not preserved for review.3Plyler v. State, 309 S.C. 408,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3On the merits, it is a close a question whether the solicitor went\r\noutside the record by inferring the crime petitioner intended to commit\r\nwas rape. State v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997)\r\n(arguments must be confined to evidence in the record and reasonable\r\ninferences therefrom, although a failure to do so will not automatically\r\nresult in reversal); State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996),\r\ncert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 117 S.Ct. 1561, 137 L.Ed.2d 708 (1997) (closing\r\narguments must be confined to the evidence in the record and its\r\nreasonable inferences).  However, even if the remarks were improper, they\r\ndid not prejudice petitioner's right to a fair trial because the evidence\r\nagainst petitioner on the burglary charge was overwhelming. State v.\r\nHuggins, supra (a new trial will not be granted unless the prosecutor's\r\ncomments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting\r\nconviction a denial of due process); see also Darden v. Wainwright. 477\r\nU.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986); State v. Tucker, supra\r\n(the burden of proof is on appellant to show prejudice as a result of the\r\nsolicitor's improper comments); State v. Copeland, supra (a reviewing court\r\nwill view the alleged improper remark in the context of the entire record).\r\nThus, in our opinion, these comments did not affect the outcome of the\r\ntrial. Compare with United States v. Wilson, 135 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 1998)\r\n(prosecutor's improper argument that defendant murdered someone\r\n\r\n\r\np.27\r\n\r\nSIMMONS v.

Kalyvas,            Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Opinion No. 24796\r\nSubmitted April 14, 1998 - Filed June 1, 1998\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames T. Kalyvas of Sarasota, Florida, pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Counsel Henry B. Richardson, Jr., and\r\nSenior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle,\r\nJr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter,\r\nrespondent and disciplinary counsel have entered into an agreement under\r\nRule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE)\r\ncontained in Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits he\r\nhas committed misconduct and agrees to disbarment.  We accept the\r\nagreement and disbar respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Federal Conviction\r\n\r\n\r\n In December 1995, a federal district court jury in Oklahoma\r\nconvicted respondent of wire fraud and causing a criminal act in violation\r\nof 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(b) and 1343.  The jury also convicted a co-defendant,\r\n\r\n\r\np.29\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF KALYVAS \r\n\r\nMulk Raj Dass, of five counts of conspiracy and wire fraud.  Dass and\r\nrespondent engaged in a scheme in 1993 to defraud Ronald Kirkpatrick\r\nand others doing business as Oklahoma Feldspar Corporation (Feldspar), a\r\nmining company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Dass and respondent promised to obtain a \"financial guarantee\r\nbond\" that would enable Feldspar to secure a $2 million loan.  Feldspar\r\nplaced $100,000 in respondent's trust account, of which Dass and\r\nrespondent agreed to return $90,000 promptly if a guarantee bond was not\r\nobtained.  No such bond was obtained.  Respondent spent nearly the\r\nentire amount on his personal expenses within days of receiving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In May 1996, a federal district 3'udge in Oklahoma sentenced\r\nrespondent to eighteen months in prison, and ordered him to pay $15,000\r\nin restitution to the victims and serve three years of supervised release\r\nfollowing his prison term.  The judge found that the total loss attributable\r\nto respondent as a result of his involvement in the Feldspar scheme was\r\n$75,000, but concluded respondent did not have the ability to repay that\r\namount.1 The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed respondent's\r\nconviction and sentence. United States v. Kalyyas, Nos. 96-5176 and 96-\r\n5144, 1997 WL 651761 (10th Cir.  Oct. 21, 1997) (unpublished opinion).\r\nThis Court temporarily suspended respondent from the practice of law on\r\nJuly 11, 1996, as a result of the conviction.  In the Matter of Kalyvas, 322\r\nS.C. 531, 473 S.E.2d 448 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Robert Kohn Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n Respondent agreed to act as escrow agent in a business deal\r\nbetween Dass and Robert Kohn of New Jersey, who represented a group of\r\ninvestors.  Dass and Kohn's investment group hoped to secure $650 million\r\nin bonds to invest in distressed real estate.  Dass would receive a\r\ncommitment fee of $637,200.  The agreement called for Kohn's investment\r\ngroup to place $187,500 in respondent's trust account as its share of the\r\ncommitment fee.  If the bonds were not issued within thirty days,\r\nrespondent agreed to return the advanced funds promptly to Kohn's\r\ninvestment group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The judge also found that respondent's involvement in two other\r\nfraudulent schemes, including the Robert Kohn matter described below,\r\ncaused the victims to lose an additional $246,900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF KALYVAS \r\n\r\n An analysis of respondent's trust account showed the balance\r\nwas $110.52 on January 31, 1994.  Kohn's investment group deposited a\r\ntotal of $187,482.50 in the account from February 4-9, 1994.  On February\r\n4, after the group had deposited $100,000 into the account, the account\r\nhad a balance of only $39,831.43, indicating that respondent had disbursed\r\nsome of the group's money without its permission.  The account balance at\r\nthe end of February 1994 was $9,471.20. Respondent did not hold the\r\ngroup's money in trust, but disbursed some funds to Dass and paid other\r\nexpenses of his own, including rent and one check written directly to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n No bonds were ever issued on behalf of Kohn's investment\r\ngroup.  When Kohn filed a disciplinary complaint on November 27, 1995,\r\nrespondent had not returned any of the advanced funds to the investment\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Wilkie Corporation Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n Respondent maintained a law practice in Sarasota, Florida.\r\nHe was licensed to practice law in South Carolina, but not in Florida.  In\r\n1994, respondent agreed to serve as counsel for Infinity International\r\nInvestments, Ltd., a Louisiana corporation headed by Dass.  Dass entered\r\ninto an agreement with Nikkei International, Inc., a Delaware corporation,\r\nand the Wilkie Corporation of California.  Nikkei International held at\r\nleast $2 million in standby letters of credit issued by a Mexican bank.  In\r\nthe agreement, Dass pledged to help Nikkei International obtain up to $50\r\nmillion in financing for projects in Mexico by locating entities willing to\r\nmake one-year loans on the basis of Nikkei International's letters of credit.\r\nDass would retain a portion of the loan proceeds as his fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Wilkie Corporation agreed to place $100,000 in\r\nrespondent's trust account to demonstrate the legitimacy of the standby\r\nletters of credit held by Nikkei International.  In the agreement, Dass\r\npromised to find an entity willing to make a written commitment to loan\r\n$2 million to Nikkei International on the basis of its letters of credit\r\nwithin three days of receiving $100,000 from the Wilkie Corporation.  Dass\r\nfurther agreed to return the $100,000 in full after Nikkei International\r\nhad obtained loans with a face value of $50 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Wilkie Corporation transferred $100,000 to respondent's\r\ntrust account on June 1, 1994.  Dass failed to secure any loan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.31\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF KALYVAS \r\n\r\ncommitments and no loans were ever obtained.  The Wilkie Corporation\r\ndemanded the return of its funds from respondent.  Respondent first\r\npromised to return the money by August 24, 1994, and then by September\r\n2, 1994.  Respondent had returned only $50,000 to the Wilkie Corporation\r\nwhen a disciplinary investigation into this matter began in October 1994.\r\nRespondent returned the remaining $50,000 to the Wilkie Corporation in\r\nDecember 1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n An investigation revealed that respondent wrote checks from\r\nhis trust account to pay personal expenses, including rent and expenses for\r\nhis daughter at college, family members, West Publishing Company, and a\r\nrestaurant.  Respondent's trust account balance was $500 prior to the\r\ntransfer of $100,000 from Wilkie Corporation.  Some checks written on the\r\naccount by respondent during June 1994 were returned due to insufficient\r\nfunds, and the trust account balance was $110.33 on June 30, 1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n Respondent admits he has committed misconduct in this\r\nmatter.  He admits he has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or\r\na serious crime.  Rule 8.4(b), (c), and (d) of the Rules of Professional\r\nConduct (RPC) contained in Rule 407, SCACR; Rule 7(a)(4), RLDE.\r\nRespondent admits he has engaged in conduct tending to pollute the\r\nadministration of justice and bring the courts and legal profession into\r\ndisrepute.  Rule 8.4(e), RPC; Rule 7(a)(5), RLDE.  In addition, respondent\r\nadmits violating the oath of office he took upon the admission to practlc6\r\nlaw in this state.  Rule 7(a)(6), RLDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Respondent further admits he did not represent his clients in a\r\ncompetent manner, and wrongfully assisted a client in conduct he knew to\r\nbe criminal or fraudulent.  Rules 1.1, 1.2(d) and (e), RPC.  Respondent\r\nadmits he failed to keep funds belonging to another separate from his own\r\nfunds, and he failed to promptly render a full accounting regarding the\r\nstatus of those funds to his clients and interested third parties.  Rule\r\n1.15(a),and (b), RPC.  He admits he failed to promptly comply with\r\nreasonable requests for information.  Rule 1.4(a), RPC.

Anders, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant\r\nAttorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of\r\nColumbia, Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter,\r\nrespondent and disciplinary counsel have entered into an agreement under\r\nRule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits\r\nmisconduct and consents to be disbarred from the practice of law.  We\r\naccept the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In July 1997, respondent, while employed as a deputy solicitor\r\nfor the Sixth Judicial Circuit, requested or agreed to accept sexual favors\r\nfrom a female defendant in exchange for dismissing a charge of driving\r\nunder the influence.  Respondent was indicted by the State Grand Jury for\r\nacceptance of a bribe in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-220 (1985) in\r\nAugust 1997.  Thereafter, respondent was placed on interim suspension.\r\nIn the Matter of Roberts, 327 S.C. 261, 489 S.E.2d 480 (1997). The State\r\nGrand Jury later indicted respondent for three counts of criminal sexual\r\nconduct in the third degree, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-654\r\n(1985).  Respondent subsequently pled guilty to one count of acceptance of\r\na bribe and one count of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree and\r\nwas sentenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n These crimes are serious crimes as defined by Rule 2(z), RLDE,\r\nsince the circumstances of their commission adversely reflect on\r\n\r\n\r\np.34\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF ROBERTS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondent's honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer.\r\nAdditionally, acceptance of a bribe for the dismissal of criminal charges is\r\na crime of moral turpitude. See In the Matter of Davis, 270 S.C. 262, 241\r\nS.E.2d 895 (1978) (Court held that magistrate who entered pleas to several\r\ncharges including acceptance of a bribe committed crimes of moral\r\nturpitude).  Furthermore, we now hold that the commission of criminal\r\nsexual conduct in any degree is a crime of moral turpitude. Cf.  State v.\r\nMcFarlane 279 S.C. 327, 306 S.E.2d 611 (1983) (criminal sexual conduct\r\nwith a minor in any degree is a crime of moral turpitude); State v. Jones,\r\n271 S.C. 287i, 247 S.E.2d 43 (1978) (assault with intent to rape is a crime\r\nof moral turpitude).  By being convicted of these serious crimes that are\r\nalso crimes of moral turpitude, respondent has committed misconduct\r\nunder Rule 7(a)(4), RLDE.  Finally, respondent has engaged in conduct\r\ninvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of\r\nRule 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Accordingly, we disbar respondent from the practice of law.\r\nRespondent's request to make this disbarment retroactive to the date of\r\nhis interim suspension is denied.  Within fifteen days of the date of this\r\nopinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\nthat he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\np.35\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24798","title":"Drummond v.

BEASLEY \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.    May the Governor veto sentences and phrases from\r\nan appropriation bill when the text being vetoed is not a\r\ndistinct item, section, or subsection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  May the Governor, through the issuance of a veto\r\nmessage, redirect funds appropriated by the General\r\nAssembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  May the Governor combine multiple distinct items,\r\nsections, or subsections into a single veto message for\r\nreconsideration by the General Assembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n I. Petitioner challenges the validity of certain vetoes on the\r\nground that the Governor exceeded his authority by vetoing sentences and a\r\nphrase which are not distinct items, sections, or subsections of the\r\nappropriation bill.1 Petitioner contends that by striking a word, phrase,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The following vetoes are challenged:\r\nVeto 5: Part IB, section 30.21, Department of Health &amp; Environmental\r\nControl: Vital Records Fees, the following sentence: \"Any fee increase\r\nabove the state fiscal year 1997 fee structure shall be returned to the\r\nVital Records Central Office (Office of Public Health Statistics and\r\nInformation Systems, Division of Vital Records).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVeto 6: Part IB, Section 33.4, Department of Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse\r\nServices Chemical Dependency Programs, the last four sentences of the\r\nproviso as follows:\r\n The Department will present a report to the Governor's Office,\r\n to the Senate Finance Committee and to the House Ways and\r\n Means Committee no later than December 1, 1997.  The\r\n Department is authorized to spend one half of the appropriated\r\n funds for this project for the first six months of the current\r\n fiscal year.  The remaining funds for this project for the second\r\n half of the fiscal year may only be spent upon the written\r\n approval of the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee\r\n and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee\r\n\r\n\r\np.4\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND V. BEASLEY \r\n\r\nclause, or sentence, the Governor creates legislation inconsistent with that\r\nenacted by the General Assembly.      Further, petitioner contends the\r\nGovernor's power does not extend to modifying legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Petitioner asks the Court to apply the following as a standard of\r\nreview here: 1) the Constitution vests with the General Assembly the right\r\nand sole authority to delineate the parts of an appropriation act, and 2) the\r\nGovernor may not establish \"distinct items and sections\" by the selection of\r\nspecific text, but may only object to \"distinct items and sections\" pursuant to\r\nS.C. Coin Operators Assn. v. Beasley, 320 S.C. 183, 464 S.E.2d 103 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Governor asserts he has stricken matter which constitute\r\ndistinct parts that are included under one label.  Further, the Governor\r\ncontends the S.C. Constitution and precedent recognize that distinct parts of\r\nlegislation appropriating money can be vetoed, including phrases and\r\nsentences.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The constitutional provision which gives the Governor veto power\r\nprovides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter receipt and written approval of the progress report\r\nsubmitted to them on December 1, 1997.  The Department is\r\nrequired to include in their [sic] progress report due December\r\n1, 1997, budgetary information on the matching funds for the\r\nprograms from all sources including, but not limited to, state,\r\nfederal, county and other local funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVeto 11: Part IB, Section 72.42, General Provision: State Owned Aircraft -\r\nMaintenance Logs: \"The Ethics Commission is authorized to make\r\ninvestigations of state agency records relating to these reporting\r\nrequirements.  Officials violating the 48 hour reporting requirement in this\r\nparagraph are subject to a non-suspendable $100 fine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVeto 19: Part 11, Section 54, Video Poker, the first sentence of item S that\r\nreads: \"Subsections A, 1, L, M, N, P, and R of the section are effective\r\nNovember 1, 1997.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVeto 20: Part 11, Section 64, Drug Awareness Resistance Education Fund,\r\nthe phrase \"with the advice and consent of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\np.5\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND V. BEASLEY \r\n\r\nBills appropriating money out of the Treasury shall\r\nspecify the objects and purposes for which the same\r\nare made'  and appropriated to them respectively their\r\nseveral amounts in distinct items and sections.  If the\r\nGovernor shall not approve any one or more of the\r\nitems or sections contained in any bill appropriating\r\nmoney, but shall approve of the residue thereof, it\r\nshall become a law as to the residue in like manner\r\nas if he had signed it.  The Governor shall then\r\nreturn the bill with his objections to the items or\r\nsections of the same not approved by him to the\r\nhouse in which the bill originated....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n S.C. Const. art.  IV, Â§ 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n In Coin Operators, the Governor vetoed subsections or parts of a\r\n permanent provision.  Petitioners in Coin Operators asserted the Governor\r\n can only veto those parts labeled by the legislature as items or sections.  This\r\n Court disagreed, stating that the requirement of itemization is to be given a\r\n common-sense construction. Cox v. Bates, 237 S.C. 198, 116 S.E.2d 828\r\n (1960).   However, in Coin Operators, the parts vetoed were labeled as\r\n subsections.   Here the vetoes in question go a step further and strike\r\n sentences, words, and phrases of identifiable sections or items of the\r\n appropriation bill.  Longstanding practice demonstrates that Governors have\r\n vetoed entire sections or subsections of appropriation bills.  As noted in\r\n Williams v. Morris, 320 S.C. 196, 464 S.E.2d 97 (1995), both this Court and\r\n the United States Supreme Court have found that courts should give weight\r\n to long -established practice and legislative interpretations in interpreting\r\n constitutional provision relative to executive veto power.2 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In the majority of instances where governors have exercised the\r\nline item veto authority in appropriation bills, entire Part I or Part 11\r\nprovisions have been vetoed.  Such parts were distinctly labeled by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.  Practice since 1961 demonstrates that governors have\r\ngenerally vetoed whole items distinctly labeled by the legislature.  There are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Citing Okanogan, Methow Tribes v. United States, 279 U.S. 655, 49\r\nS.Ct. 463 (1929) which was inadvertently cited in Coin Operators as White\r\nRiver Lumber Co. v. State of Arkansas ex rel.  Applegate, 279 U.S. 692, 49\r\nS.Ct. 457 (1929).\r\n\r\n\r\np.6\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND V. BEASLEY \r\n\r\na few instances between 1938 and 1961 where governors have vetoed\r\nsentences and parts of sentences.  However, there has been no legal challenge\r\nto the practice of vetoing sentences or phrases.  In Coin Operators, this Court\r\ncited with some approval, the veto of part of a sentence. 3 This language\r\nbe characterized as dicta since the question before the Court did not address\r\nthe propriety of vetoes of parts of subsections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n States which have dealt with similar vetoes have disapproved of\r\n governors striking parts of sections or items.  The Iowa Supreme Court in\r\n Rush v. Ray , 362 N.W.2d 479 (Iowa 1985), held that the item veto power\r\n does not contemplate striking out conditions and restrictions alone as items\r\n because that would be creating, rather than negating legislation.  In Colton\r\n v. Branstad, 372 N.W.2d 184 (Iowa 1985), the governor vetoed a portion of\r\n section 12 of the appropriation bill. The court struggled with what\r\n constitutes an item in the appropriation bill.  The Colton court concluded that\r\n those provisions in an appropriation bill which are separate and distinct from\r\n other provisions in the same bill, insofar as the subject, purpose, or amount\r\n of the appropriation is concerned, are items within the meaning of the\r\n constitutional item veto provision.  In Welden v. Ray , 229 N.W.2d 706 (Iowa\r\n 1975), the governor vetoed portions of conditions associated with various\r\n appropriations.  The plaintiffs challenged whether the power to veto includes\r\n the power not only to nullify but also to alter.  The court noted the governor\r\n\"may not distort, frustrate or defeat the legislative purpose by a veto of\r\n proper legislative conditions, restrictions, limitations or contingencies placed\r\n upon an appropriation and permit the appropriation to stand. [To do so] he\r\n would create new law, and this power is vested in the Legislature and not\r\n in the Governor.\" By selectively striking a word, phrase, clause, or sentence,\r\n the Governor creates legislation inconsistent with that enacted by the General\r\n Assembly. State ex rel.  Coll v. Carruthers, 759 P.2d 1380 (N.M. 1988).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We have previously decided the governor can veto subsections of\r\nthe appropriation bill using common-sense construction as to what is an item\r\nor section.  Viewing past occurrences, Governors have used the line-item veto\r\npower to strike similar matter as that challenged here.  However, those\r\nactions did not reach this Court for review.  Further, such prior occurrences\r\ncannot enlarge the constitutional authority of the Governor with respect to\r\nthe right to make vetoes under Art.  IV, Â§ 21.  The vetoes of sentences, words\r\nand phrases does not meet the common sense construction of an item or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Part of a sentence in Section 1, Act 344, 1949. \r\n\r\np.7\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND V. BEASLEY \r\n\r\nsection.  The Governor has a negative power to void a distinct item.  See\r\nState v. Jones, 99 S.C. 89, 82 S.E. 882 (1914).  The veto power can be\r\nexercised only when clearly authorized by the constitution, and the language\r\nconferring it is to be strictly construed. Colorado General Assembly v. Lamm,\r\n704 P.2d 1371 (1985).  The challenged vetoes effectively modify legislation\r\nrather than nullify legislation.  We conclude the Governor can only veto those\r\nparts labeled by the legislature as items or sections.  S.C. Const. art.  IV, Â§\r\n21. Veto messages 5, 6, 11, 19 in part, and 20 are invalid. Rush v. Ray\r\nsupra; State ex rel.  Coll v. Carruthers, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.        Petitioner contends the governor attempted to redirect funds to\r\nanother purpose through veto 17 combined with various vetoes to monetary\r\nitems in the Appropriation Act and the Capital Reserve Act.  Petitioner\r\nchallenges the stated reason for the veto wherein the governor states \"I am\r\nvetoing this item to fulfill my commitment to restore the original\r\nmanufacturer's depreciation tax reduction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Governor contends no issue is presented for this Court to\r\ndecide.  We agree.  During oral argument, the Senate conceded that the\r\nGovernor's veto message expressing this intent does not have the force of law\r\nsince it is not a legislative act nor an Executive Order.  Veto message 17\r\nupheld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n III.       Petitioner asserts the Governor unconstitutionally returned his\r\n objections to multiple distinct items and sections in a single veto message\r\n forcing the legislature to reconsider multiple questions as one question.  Veto\r\n 19 deleted subsections A, 1, L, M, N, P, R and part of S of the permanent\r\n provision regulating video poker.  As petitioner points out, similar action was\r\n taken in the Governor's veto message 97 which was challenged in Coin\r\n Operators, supra.  However, no question was raised in Coin Operators\r\n challenging the combining of objections.  We find no constitutional nor\r\n legislative requirement prohibiting the Governor from returning vetoes with\r\n multiple items or sub-items included within a single objection in\r\n appropriation bills.  Likewise, there is no specific prohibition against the\r\n legislature separately considering multiple items within an objection.  Veto\r\n message 19 upheld in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES INVALID IN PART AND UPHELD IN PART.\r\n\r\n\r\np.8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24799","title":"Bishop v.

We affirm\r\nas modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On March 1, 1990, Petitioner Brenda Bishop (grandmother)\r\nsigned an affidavit which led to the involuntary commitment of her\r\ndaughter, Tammi Lee Hatley (mother), to Respondent South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Mental Health (Department) for mental illness.\r\nSpecifically, grandmother alleged mother had made threats against Bobbi\r\nHatley Robertson (victim), mother's three-year-old daughter.  At the time,,\r\ngrandmother had legal custody of victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Mother was lawfully committed to the Patrick B. Harris\r\nPsychiatric Hospital where she was examined by a physician, observed by\r\nnurses, and interviewed by a social worker.  Two designated examiners\r\nexamined mother and determined she was not mentally ill.  Consequently,\r\non March 2, 1990, mother was released pursuant to an order of the\r\nprobate court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On March 3, 1990, mother appeared at the home of\r\ngrandmother.  Grandmother allowed mother to enter the home and\r\ngrandmother, mother and victim spent several hours visiting together.\r\nGrandmother then acquiesced to mother's request to allow her to have\r\ncustody of victim for a specific period of time.  Thereafter, victim left with\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n After mother returned victim to grandmother a few hours\r\nlater, grandmother noticed victim had green felt tip magic markings on\r\nher arms and body, including her abdominal and vaginal areas.  Victim\r\nwas examined by a physician at Greenville Memorial Hospital; no evidence\r\nof penetration or other trauma was found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Grandmother brought this action on behalf of victim against\r\nthe Department for the physical abuse of victim allegedly received at the\r\nhands of mother.  Specifically, grandmother alleged the Department was\r\nnegligent in releasing mother, in failing to warn of her release, and in\r\nfailing to properly diagnose and treat mother for those illnesses which\r\ncaused her to have dangerous propensities towards victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the\r\n\r\n\r\np.11\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment.  The court held the Department was not civilly liable\r\npursuant to the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-60 (Supp. 1997) and\r\n44-17-900 (1976) for releasing mother.1 The court concluded the\r\nDepartment had no duty to warn grandmother of mother's release.  The\r\ncourt found grandmother was well aware of mother's alleged threats at the\r\ntime she permitted mother to take victim for visitation.  Finally, the\r\ncircuit court held any duty of the Department regarding the diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of mother was owed to mother and not to third parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On appeal, grandmother argued the circuit court erred in\r\ngranting summary judgment on victim's negligence claims against the\r\nDepartment based on its findings that the Department did not owe a duty\r\nto warn victim of mother's release and that the Department did not owe\r\nany duty of care to victim regarding mother's treatment.  The Court of\r\nAppeals disagreed and affirmed the circuit court's grant of summary\r\njudgment. Bishop, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Court of Appeals found the evidence established mother\r\ndid not make a specific threat of harm to victim while in the Department's\r\ncustody and, therefore, the Department had no duty to warn of her\r\nrelease.  The Court of Appeals noted grandmother, victim's guardians was\r\nobviously aware of mother's release when she appeared at her home and\r\ngrandmother was aware of mother's threats to harm victim, yet\r\ngrandmother allowed mother to take victim from her home for an\r\nunsupervised visit.  With regard to the Department's duty to properly\r\ndiagnose and treat mother, the Court of Appeals held the Department\r\nowed this duty to mother and not victim.

Did the Court of Appeals err in holding the Department\r\ndid not owe a duty of care to victim to properly diagnose and\r\ntreat mother; instead, this duty of care was only owed to\r\nmother?\r\n\r\n1This issue is not before this Court. \r\n\r\np.12\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\n\r\n Summary judgment is appropriate where it is clear there is no\r\ngenuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to\r\njudgment as a matter of law. Hamiter v. Retirement Division of South\r\nCarolina Budget and Control Board, _ S.C. _, 484 S.E.2d 586 (1997).\r\nIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and\r\nall inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I.\r\n\r\n\r\n Grandmother argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming\r\nthe grant of summary judgment to the Department because the\r\nDepartment had a common law duty to warn victim of mother's release\r\nsince victim was a known potential victim of mother.  Specifically,\r\ngrandmother contends the Court of Appeals erred in finding because no\r\nexpress specific threat of harm was made by mother against victim while\r\nin the custody of the Department, the Department had no duty to warn\r\nvictim.  According to grandmother, the Department knew mother had\r\nmade specific threats against victim; therefore, it had a duty to warn\r\nvictim upon mother's release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n An essential element in a cause of action for negligence is the\r\nexistence of a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.\r\nWithout a duty, there is no actionable negligence. Rogers v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nParole &amp; Community Corrections, 320 S.C. 253, 464 @.E.2d 330 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n South Carolina law does not recognize a general duty to warn\r\nof the dangerous propensities of others. Rogers, supra; Sharpe v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Mental Health, 292 S.C. 11, 354 S.E.2d 778 (Ct.  App. 1987), cert.\r\ndismissed, 294 S.C. 469, 366 S.E.2d 12 (1988).  However, when a\r\ndefendant has the ability to monitor, supervise, and control an individual's\r\nconduct, a special relationship exists between the defendant and the\r\nindividual, and the defendant may have a common law duty to warn\r\npotential victims of the individual's dangerous conduct. Rogers, supra\r\n(citing Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 315 &amp; 319).  This duty to warn\r\narises when the individual has made a specific threat of harm directed at\r\na specific individual. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\np.13\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The seminal case on the liability of one treating a mentally\r\n afflicted patient for failure to warn or protect third persons threatened by\r\n a patient is Tarasoff v. Regents of Universitv of California, 551 P.2d 334\r\n (Cal. 1976).  In Tarasoff, the court permitted the plaintiffs to amend their\r\n complaints to state a cause of action against the therapists by asserting\r\n that the therapists in fact determined that their patient presented a\r\n serious danger of violence to the decedent, or pursuant to the standards of\r\n their profession should have so determined, but nevertheless failed to\r\n exercise reasonable care to protect decedent from that danger.  The\r\n patient, a voluntary out-patient, informed his therapist that he was going\r\n to kill a girl, unnamed yet readily identifiable as the decedent, when she\r\n returned from Brazil.  No one warned the decedent of her peril.  Shortly\r\n after decedent returned from Brazil, the patient killed her.  According to\r\nthe court,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a therapist determines, or pursuant to the\r\nstandards of his profession should determine, that\r\nhis patient presents a serious danger of violence to\r\nanother, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable\r\ncare to protect the intended victim against such\r\ndanger.  The discharge of this duty may require the\r\ntherapist to take one or more of various steps,\r\ndepending upon the nature of the case.  Thus it\r\nmay call for him to warn the intended victim or\r\nothers likely to apprise the victim of the danger, to\r\nnotify the police, or to take whatever other steps\r\nare reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 340.  The court, citing Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 315-320 to\r\nsupport its position, stated when the defendant stands in some special\r\nrelationship to the person whose conduct needs to be controlled, a duty of\r\ncare may be imposed upon the defendant to protect threatened third\r\nparties from harm.  The court then found a special relationship between\r\nthe patient and therapists which would give rise to this duty to protect a\r\nthreatened third person from harm.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Here, the Department had a special relationship with mother\r\nbecause the Department had custody and control of mother.  Thus, if the\r\nDepartment knew or should have known a specific threat was made by\r\nmother, the Department had a duty to warn the threatened third party of\r\nmother's release.\r\n\r\n\r\np.14\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In our opinion the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Rogers\r\nrequiring the threat to be made while in the custody of defendant is too\r\nnarrow.  While cases following Tarasoff have made clear that this duty is\r\nonly owed when a patient specifically threatens a readily identifiable third\r\nparty, none of these cases limit liability by requiring the threat to be\r\nmade while under the control of or in the custody of the defendant.\r\nRogers, supra; Thompson v. County of Alameda, 614 P.2d 728 (Cal. 1980);\r\nCairl v. State, 323 N.W.2d 20 (Minn. 1982).  Instead, all that is required\r\nis the defendant be aware or should have been aware of the specific threat\r\nmade by the patient to harm a specific person. See Jablonski v. United\r\nStates, 712 F.2d 391 (9th Cir. 1983) (patient's previous history indicated\r\nhe would direct his violence against victim).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Although the Department's discharge summary stated mother\r\nrelated to the examiners she had no intention of hurting herself or her\r\nfamily and mother did not make a specific threat of harm to her child\r\nwhile in the Department's custody, the Department was aware mother had\r\nmade specific threats to harm victim in the past.  These threats were\r\nnoted on the documents admitting mother into the custody of the\r\nDepartment.  This knowledge was sufficient to trigger the Department's\r\nduty to warn victim of mother's release because a specific threat had been\r\nmade by mother to harm a specific person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n However, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\nthe Department.  Even though the Department failed to warn of mother's\r\nrelease thus breaching its duty to warn, its breach of this duty was not a\r\nproximate cause of the harm suffered by victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n To establish a cause of action in negligence, three essential\r\nelements must be proven: (1) duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff;\r\n(2) breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage\r\nproximately resulting from the breach of duty. Rickborn v. Liberty Life\r\nIns.  Co., 321 S.C. 291, 468 S.E.2d 292 (1996).  Negligence is not actionable\r\nunless it is a proximate cause of the injury. Hanselmann v. McCardle\r\n275 S.C. 46, 267 S.E.2d 531 (1980).  Proximate cause requires proof Of\r\nboth causation in fact and legal cause. Oliver v. S.C. Dep't of Highways\r\nand Public Transportation, 309 S.C. 313, 422 S.E.2d 128 (1992).\r\nCausation in fact is proved by establishing the injury would not have\r\noccurred \"but for\" the defendant's negligence.  Id. Legal cause is proved\r\nby establishing foreseeability. Oliver, supra; Koester v. Carolina Rental\r\nCtr., Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 443 S.E.2d 392 (1994).  Foreseeability is\r\ndetermined by looking to the natural and probable consequences of the\r\n\r\n\r\np.15\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplained of act. Koester, supra.  The defendant's negligence does not\r\nhave to be the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury; instead, the\r\nplaintiff must prove the defendant's negligence was at least one of the\r\nproximate causes of the injury. Hughes v. Children's Clinic, P.A., 269 S.C.\r\n389, 237 S.E.2d 753 (1977).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The intervening negligence of a third person will not excuse\r\nthe first wrongdoer if such intervention ought to have been foreseen in the\r\nexercise of due care.  In such case, the original negligence still remains\r\nactive, and a contributing cause of the injury. Locklear v. Southeastern\r\nStages, Inc., 193 S.C. 309, 8 S.E.2d 321 (1940).  The test by which the\r\nnegligent conduct of the original wrongdoer is to be insulated as a matter\r\nof law by the independent negligent conduct of another is whether the\r\nintervening act and the injury resulting therefrom are of such character\r\nthat the author of the primary negligence should have reasonably foreseen\r\nand anticipated them in light of the attendant circumstances. Oliver,\r\nsupra; Locklear, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n It is generally for the jury to determine whether the\r\ndefendant's negligence was a concurring proximate cause of the plaintiff's\r\ninjuries. Id. Only when the evidence is susceptible of only one inference\r\ndoes proximate cause become a matter of law for the court. Oliver., supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The evidence in the record includes a report written by the\r\nemergency trauma center social worker stating the \"[c]hild visited with\r\nmother earlier today.\" Further, the trial judge made extensive findings in\r\nhis order based on the evidence introduced at the summary judgment\r\nhearing that grandmother allowed mother to enter the home; grandmother,\r\nmother and victim visited for several hours in the home; and grandmother\r\nagreed to allow mother to have unsupervised custody of victim for a\r\nspecific period of time.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Grandmother was well aware that mother had made threats\r\nagainst victim.3 When mother appeared at grandmother's house three\r\n\r\n2Because we find the facts are sufficiently developed in the record\r\nwith regard to grandmother's intervening negligence, we affirm on this\r\nground even though the trial judge made no specific ruling on this issue in\r\nhis order.  See Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n3Grandmother claims because the duty to warn was owed to victim,\r\nthe grandmother's knowledge of mother's threats was insufficient.  The\r\n\r\n\r\np.16\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndays after her commitment, grandmother became aware mother had been\r\nreleased from the Department.  Grandmother allowed mother to enter her\r\nhome, and after spending several hours visiting with mother, grandmother\r\nallowed mother to take victim from the home for an unsupervised visit.\r\nGrandmother had ample knowledge, without the Department's warning, to\r\nmake an informed decision about whether to allow victim to visit with\r\nmother unsupervised.  Grandmother made no allegation that she was\r\nalarmed or felt threatened when mother entered the house or when\r\nmother asked to visit with the child alone.  Further, grandmother did not\r\nallege that she attempted to contact any authorities concerning mother's\r\nrelease when mother appeared at her residence.  Thus, grandmother was\r\nnegligent in allowing victim to leave with mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We find, as a matter of law, the Department could not\r\nreasonably foresee grandmother would allow mother to visit with victim\r\nunsupervised since only three days earlier grandmother had mother\r\ninvoluntarily committed because mother was threatening to harm victim.\r\nThe evidence is susceptible of only this inference.4 Consequently,\r\ngrandmother's intervening negligence supersedes the Department's\r\nnegligence for failing to warn of mother's release and the Department will\r\nnot be held liable for its negligence because its negligence was not a\r\nproximate cause of victim's harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n II.\r\n\r\n\r\n Grandmother contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming\r\nthe grant of summary judgment to the Department on the issue of alleged\r\nnegligence in the diagnosis and treatment of mother because the minor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfocus should be on what victim knew.  We disagree.  Grandmother was the\r\nlegal guardian of victim and as such she was responsible for making\r\ndecisions to ensure victim's safety.  Victim was too young to make these\r\ndecisions for herself; therefore, it is the grandmother's knowledge that is\r\nimportant. See Tarasoff. supra (duty to warn victim or person who would\r\napprise victim of danger).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 4We disagree with the dissent's finding that the evidence is\r\nsusceptible to at least two other reasonable inferences.  The dissent is\r\nspeculating as to possible motivations to explain grandmother's actions.\r\nHowever, the motivation for grandmother's actions are irrelevant.  Instead,\r\napplication of intervening negligence arises from grandmother's conduct\r\nand grandmother's assumed motivations do not displace her conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\np.17\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchild was a foreseeable plaintiff within the scope of danger and the\r\nDepartment owed a duty of care to victim.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In South Carolina, a malpractice claim canonry be maintained\r\n by the patient.  If a physician deviated from accepted standards of\r\n professional care in treating a patient, he breached a duty of care to the\r\n patient and not a third party. Sharpe v. S.C. Dep't of Mental Health, 292\r\n 11, 354 S.E.2d 778 (Ct.  App. 1987) (concurring opinion of Bell, J.), cert.\r\n dismissed, 294 S.C. 469, 366 S.E.2d 12 (1988) (duty of care owed to\r\n patient and not third parties).  Other jurisdictions agree with this\r\n requirement and do not allow injured third parties to recover. See Moye\r\n v. United States, 735 F. Supp. 179 (E.D.N.C. 1990) (there must be a\r\n physician-patient relationship between victim and doctor before the court\r\n will find a doctor owes a victim harmed by his patient a duty of care to\r\n properly evaluate and treat patient); Russell v. Adams, 482 S.E.2d 30\r\n (N.C. Ct.  App. 1997) (psychologists, like other health care providers, may\r\n be held liable in medical malpractice only to their patients).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n However, some jurisdictions allow third parties to recover for a\r\nphysician's malpractice under certain circumstances. See Molien v. Kaiser\r\nFoundation Hospitals, 616 P.2d 813 (Cal. 1980) (because a negligent\r\nmisdiagnosis of a communicable disease may foreseeably cause injury to\r\nclose members of patient's family, the physician's duty of care extends to\r\nthem); Hofmann v. Blackmon, 241 So.2d 752 (Fla.  App. 1970) (a doctor is\r\nliable to persons infected by his patient if he negligently fails to diagnose\r\na contagious disease); Wojcik v. Aluminum Co. of America, 183 N.Y.S.2d\r\n351 (Sup.  Ct. 1959) (doctor is liable for failing to warn patient's family of\r\npatient's contagious disease).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The physician-patient relationship is not a requisite in every\r\nlegal action against a medical provider.  A reasonably foreseeable third\r\nparty, who is harmed by a physician's malpractice in treating a patient,\r\nmay initiate an action against a physician for malpractice under limited\r\ncircumstances.  See Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. supra;\r\nHofmann v. Blackmon, supra; Wojcik v. Aluminum Co. of America, supra.\r\nHowever, in the matter sub judice, the Department did not owe victim a\r\nduty to properly diagnose and treat mother.  This duty was owed only to\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n FINNEY, C.J. , and MOORE, A. J. concur. TOAL and WALLER, JJ. ,\r\ndissenting in separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\np.18\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTM= OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL., A.J.: I respectfully dissent, believing that this case ought to be\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Essentially, the majority finds that the trial court and the Court of\r\nAppeals committed error granting summary judgment on a finding that the\r\nDepartment of Mental Health had no duty to warn grandmother that it was\r\nreleasing mother.  The majority rightly concludes that the Department had\r\nspecific knowledge that mother was a threat to grandmother.  Further, the\r\nmajority finds that the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting Rogers v. South\r\nCarolina Department of Parole &amp; Community Corrections, 320 S.C. 253, 464\r\nS.E.2d 330 (1995) to require a specific threat made while mother was in\r\ncustody.  Nevertheless, the majority upholds, on the ground of intervening\r\nnegligence of grandmother, the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the trial\r\ncourt's grant of summary judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n It is improper for the majority to base its holding on intervening\r\n negligence inasmuch as this issue is procedurally barred.  In fact, a double\r\n preservation sin is being committed here.  First, the issue of intervening\r\n negligence was not raised to, or addressed by, the trial court.  See Medlin v.\r\n South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co.,_S.C._, 480 S.E.2d 739\r\n (1997)(Issue not ruled upon by the trial court is procedurally barred.).\r\n Second, the issue was never raised to, or briefed for, this Court.  See State\r\n v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981)(An issue not argued in the\r\n appellant's brief is deemed abandoned.).       Certainly, under Rule 220(c),\r\n SCACR, the appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon\r\n any ground   appearing in the record on appeal. However, here we do not\r\n have any ground in the record to justify affirmance.  The issue has not be\r\n raised legally, nor has it really been developed factually.  If there has not\r\n been factual development about grandmother's negligence, on what basis can\r\n this Court affirm?  To make a factual determination, there must be facts\r\n before us.   To suggest that we may affirm on the basis of the mere\r\n allegations of the parties is to impermissibly expand the scope of Rule 220(c).\r\n With its decision, the majority has, in effect, changed Rule 220(c) from\r\n affirmance on the basis of \"any\" ground in the record, to affirmance on the\r\n basis of \"no\" ground in the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n However, even if we assume that this Court may properly reach the\r\nissue of intervening negligence, it is improper for us to rule upon the issue\r\nas a matter of law because it is quintessentially a question of fact.  See\r\nDixon v. Besco Engineering, Inc., 320 S.C. 174, 463 S.E.2d 636 (Ct.  App.\r\n1995)(Whether an intervening act breaks the causal connection is a question\r\nfor the fact-finder.); Small v. Pioneer Machinery, Inc., 316 S.C. 479, 450\r\n\r\n\r\np.19\r\n\r\nBISHOP v. SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 609 (Ct.  App. 1994)(The defenses of contributory negligence and\r\nassumption of risk ordinarily present questions of fact for the jury, and only\r\nrarely become questions of law for the court to determine.  The same thing\r\nmay be said of the defense of intervening third-party negligence.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The majority declares that the evidence is susceptible of only one\r\ninference.  To the contrary, there are at least two other reasonable inferences.\r\nAlthough there is little to no evidence of grandmother's negligence, there is\r\nevidence that grandmother may have acted reasonably.  The one fact that may\r\nclearly be derived from the record is that grandmother had been threatened.\r\nThe mental examination report, prepared by a licensed physician, states:\r\n\"[Mother] is a danger to her mom [i.e. grandmother] and her daughter.\r\nThreatened mom last pm.\" Another medical report states: \"Possibly into\r\nsatanism.  Threatened mother and daughter.\" Further, \"Threatened daughter\r\n&amp; mother last night.  'Put me in the hospital and I'll kill you.\"' Because\r\ngrandmother had been threatened (even with death), we may well infer that\r\nshe could have still felt intimidated of mother, even after her release, and\r\nthat she gave up the child to mother for fear of harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Alternatively, we may infer that when grandmother learned that the\r\nDepartment had released mother, she could assume that the Department had\r\ncorrectly diagnosed and treated mother.  It is alleged that mother, after her\r\nrelease, visited with grandmother for several hours.  Perhaps mother was\r\nacting normally during these hours, leading grandmother to conclude that\r\nmother had been treated by the Department.

Murphy, 323 S.C. 168, 473 S.E.2d 819 (Ct.  App.\r\n1996).  This is a Whistleblower action in which the Court of Appeals affirmed\r\nthe jury's verdict for respondent, James Gastineau (Gastineau), finding he\r\nhad been dismissed from his job in retaliation for reporting his employer's\r\nillegal conduct.  We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND/FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In 1988, the General Assembly enacted the South Carolina\r\n Whistleblower Act to protect public employees from retaliation for reporting\r\n violations of law by public bodies or their officials.  Act No. 354, 1988 S.C.\r\n Acts 2648 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 8-27-10 to -50 (Supp.\r\n 1989))(amended 1993).  At the time Gastineau's claim arose, the Act created\r\n a rebuttable presumption of retaliatory discharge if an employee was\r\n terminated within one year of reporting any violation or wrongdoing.  S.C.\r\n Code Ann. Â§ 8-27-30 (Supp. 1989)(amended 1993).1 An employer could rebut\r\n this presumption by showing the employee was discharged for reasons other\r\n than whistleblowing.  S.C. Code A-rm. Â§ 8-27-40 (Supp. 1989)(amended 1993);\r\n Gamble v. City of Manning, 304 S.C. 536, 537, 405 S.E.2d 829, 829 (1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In this case,  Gastineau showed he was fired within one year of\r\nreporting conduct which he believed was illegal.  Petitioner. the Beaufort\r\nCounty Department of Mental Retardation Board (Board), then offered\r\nevidence showing Gastineau was fired for poor job performance.\r\nFurthermore, petitioner offered evidence showing Gastineau could not have\r\nbeen fired in retaliation for making a report because Gastineau's supervisor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1The 1993 amendment eliminated this presumption. \r\n\r\np.22\r\n\r\nGASTINEAU v. MURPHY AND BEAUFORT COUNTY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas unaware of Gastineau's report when she fired him.  After the jury\r\nreturned a verdict for Gastineau, Board moved for judgment non obstante\r\nveredicto (JNOV).  The trial judge refused to grant Board's motion, and the\r\nCourt of Appeals affirmed his decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in denying the Board's motion for JNOV?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable jury could\r\nhave reached the challenged verdict. Crossley v. State Farm Mutual Auto.\r\nIns.  Co., 307 S.C. 354, 357, 415 S.E.2d 393, 395 (1992).  In deciding a motion\r\nfor JNOV, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the\r\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party; if more than one inference can\r\nbe drawn, the case must be submitted to the jury.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Gastineau shows he\r\nwas hired by the Board as a Qualified Mental Retardation Professional\r\n(QMRP) and Residential Director of a facility which housed mentally\r\nhandicapped individuals.  He began working on April 2, 1990, under the\r\nsupervision of Leigh Murphy, Executive Director of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On July 16, 1990, Gastineau's wife, Christy Gastineau, also began\r\nworking for the Board; she was hired as a trainer/driver for the Day Program\r\nat the Beaufort County Rehabilitation Center, a sheltered work program for\r\nthe mentally and physically handicapped.  Within two weeks of starting her\r\njob, Mrs. Gastineau drove several clients to work at a construction site owned\r\nby Murphy's husband.  After seeing the site and asking questions concerning\r\nthe clients' wages, Mrs. Gastineau became concerned the clients were working\r\nin unsafe conditions and being underpaid.  She voiced these concerns to her\r\nhusband.  She also confided in her superiors, Barbara Greenberg and Susan\r\nMuckenfuss.  According to Mrs. Gastineau, Muckenfuss told Greenberg that\r\n\"this is something we need to talk to [Murphy] about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Two or three weeks later, Gastineau reported Murphy's husband's\r\npossible wage violations to Alice Shook, who worked for the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Mental Retardation (SCDMR).  Shook repeated Gastineau's\r\nconcerns to her immediate supervisor, Wilson Inabinet, and his supervisor,\r\nBrant Coyle.  Inabinet and Coyle consequently decided to send a staff\r\n\r\n\r\np.23\r\n\r\nGASTINEAU v. MURPHY AND BEAUFORT COUNTY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmember from SCDMR to review the Day Program in Beaufort.  Gary Hudson,\r\nwho annually inspected programs licensed by SCDMR and had already\r\nperformed his annual inspection of Beaufort's program, was sent back to\r\nBeaufort to perform a follow-up visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On October 31, 1990, Murphy discharged Gastineau from his position\r\nas a QMRP.  Gastineau subsequently brought this suit alleging he was\r\ndischarged in retaliation for whistleblowing.  According to Gastineau, he was\r\nfired because he reported Murphy's husband to SCDMR for improperly paying\r\nclients of his facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n No reasonable jury could have concluded from the evidence introduced\r\n at trial that Gastineau was fired in retaliation for reporting conduct which\r\n he believed to be illegal.  First, the evidence viewed in the light most\r\n favorable to Gastineau does not support a finding that Murphy was even\r\n aware of Gastineau's report at the time she discharged him.  No direct\r\n evidence was introduced; in fact, Murphy testified she did not leam about\r\n Gastineau's report until November of 1990.  Furthermore, the circumstantial\r\n evidence surrounding Gastineau's report is insufficient to find Murphy was\r\n aware of the report.2 According to the Gastineaus, they informed three\r\n people of their suspicions; Gastineau introduced no evidence that any of these\r\n three discussed the Gastineaus' concerns with Murphy.3 One of these three\r\n did convey Gastineau's concerns to two other people, but these two were not\r\n called to testify, and no evidence showed they informed Murphy of\r\n Gastineau's report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held the jury may have inferred that Murphy\r\n\r\n2For circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to warrant the finding of\r\n a fact, the circumstances must lead to the conclusion with reasonable\r\n certainty and must have sufficient probative value to constitute the basis for\r\n a legal inference, not for mere speculation. Holland v. Georgia Hardwood\r\n Lumber Co., 214 S.C. 195, 204-205, 51 S.E.2d 744, 749 (1949).  The facts and\r\n circumstances shown should be reckoned with in the light of ordinary\r\n experience, and such conclusions deduced therefrom as common sense\r\n dictates; the existence of a fact cannot rest in speculation, surmise or\r\n conjecture.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 3In fact, Barbara Greenberg could not recall any complaints Gastineau\r\nor his wife made concerning the safety of clients or their wages, and Susan\r\nMuckenfuss testified neither of the Gastineaus made any complaints to her\r\nconcerning client safety or wages.\r\n\r\n\r\np.24\r\n\r\nGASTINEAU v. MURPHY AND BEAUFORT COUNTY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleamed about Gastineau's report during Gary Hudson's review. 473 S.E.2d\r\nat 824.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The jury could not have reasonably inferred Murphy learned of\r\nGastineau's report from the circumstances of Hudson's inspection.  Hudson\r\ndied prior to trial and therefore did not testify.  Alice Shook testified that\r\nHudson, who annually inspected programs licensed by SCDMR and had\r\nalready performed his annual inspection of this program, was sent to perform\r\na follow-up visit.  Shook did not know what instructions Hudson was given\r\nbecause she was not present when he was told to go to Beaufort.  Shook\r\ntestified this type of follow-up visit was not unusual.  According to Shook, the\r\ninspector does not notify the program of the impending inspection and does\r\nnot tell the program the purpose of the visit.  She also testified this type of\r\nvisit would normally lead to a written report, and although she searched for\r\na report, she did not find one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Gastineau, the\r\ncircumstances under which other inspections were performed do not lead with\r\nreasonable certainty to the conclusion that Hudson would have told anybody\r\nhe was there because of Gastineau's report.  The evidence does not even\r\nconclusively show that Hudson himself knew he was sent to Beaufort because\r\nof Gastineau's report.  The only evidence in the record is that Hudson would\r\nnot have revealed the reason for his visit, and that his visit was not out of\r\nthe ordinary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Moreover, to rebut the presumption of retaliation created by the\r\nWhistleblower Act, Board produced overwhelming evidence showing Gastineau\r\nwas discharged for failing to fulfill the responsibilities of his job.  At trial,\r\nevaluations of Gastineau's job performance after three months and six\r\nmonths were admitted into evidence. Although Gastineau showed\r\nimprovement in some areas during the time between these two evaluations,\r\nthe six-month evaluation showed an overall decline in Gastineau's\r\nperformance, notably in areas such as quality of work, judgment, planning,\r\norganizing, staffing, and policy implementation.  The notes taken by his\r\nsupervisor Murphy show Gastineau made frequent financial and payroll\r\nerrors and often needed to be reminded of deadlines.  The notes also indicate\r\nGastineau was not fulfilling his responsibility of ensuring compliance with\r\nlicensing regulations set out by the Department of Health and Environmental\r\nControl (DHEC).4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4As discussed below, compliance with DHEC regulations is critical\r\nbecause failure to do so could jeopardize federal funding.\r\n\r\n\r\np.25\r\n\r\nGASTINEAU v. MURPHY AND BEAUFORT COUNRIY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Gastineau admitted he was struggling with his job due to the amount\r\nof paperwork involved.    One of Gastineau's witnesses also confirmed\r\nGastineau did not get his clerical work done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Shortly after his six-month evaluation, Murphy I gave Gastineau a\r\nwritten warning which showed he was not improving despite being\r\ncounseled.5The warning noted and Gastineau admitted he took two staff\r\nmembers on a trip to Walterboro despite being \"advised\" by Murphy not to\r\ndo so.  The warning informed Gastineau he could be discharged for another\r\noffense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Gastineau's termination letter notes he was instructed to review\r\nexisting policies and make recommendations for changes, which he admitted\r\nhe failed to do.  Gastineau also admitted he failed to hold team meetings as\r\nrequired by federal regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n An inspector named Risley Linder testified he conducted a \"Quality\r\nAssurance Survey\" in August of 1990.  This type of review was done as a\r\npractice inspection to help the facility prepare for DHEC certification\r\ninspections.  DHEC certification was essential to the facility because without\r\nit, the facility would lose its federal funding which amounted to seventy-five\r\npercent of its budget.  In August, Linder found deficiencies in Gastineau's\r\nunit which were serious enough to have affected the program's certification.\r\nGastineau was notified of these problems during a post-inspection interview\r\nwith Linder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Linder performed a follow-up visit in October.  Although some of the\r\n deficiencies had been fixed, Linder found a more alarming problem: a\r\n significant amount of data and progress notes for which Gastineau was\r\n responsible was missing from files.  Linder testified this was a more serious\r\n problem for certification than inadequate notes.  According to Linder, having\r\n all data and progress notes in the files at all times was critically important\r\n since DHEC did not notify facilities of when it would inspect.  Linder\r\n believed the state of Gastineau's records on the day he visited would have\r\n caused DHEC to begin its decertification process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5Contrary to the dissent's assertion, the fact that Gastineau was made\r\na permanent employee after his six-month probationary period does not rebut\r\nthe Mental Retardation Board's claim that he was subsequently discharged\r\nfor \"good cause.\" The uncontradicted evidence is that Beaufort County\r\npersonnel policies dictated that employees were automatically given\r\npermanent status after a six month evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\np.26\r\n\r\nGASTINEAU v. MURPHY AND BEAUF'ORT COUNTY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Linder's comments dismayed Murphy because they showed Gastineau\r\nwas not fulfilling his role as QMRP.  Consequently, Murphy and a colleague\r\ntook over as acting QMRPs to give Gastineau an opportunity to review all of\r\nhis paperwork from the beginning of his job and make sure it complied with\r\nDHEC requirements.  When Gastineau failed to do so, Murphy realized he\r\nwould never be able to fulfill the role of QMRP, so she discharged him.\r\nGastineau's termination letter includes a detailed description of his\r\nunsatisfactory work history and was admitted into evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The evidence shows Gastineau was unable to perform his job to the\r\nsatisfaction of his supervisors and unwilling to follow directives.  Further, his\r\nincompetence was threatening the facility's funding.  The only reasonable\r\ninference to be drawn from the evidence is that Gastineau was not fired in\r\nretaliation but for being an unsatisfactory employee.  Accordingly, the trial\r\njudge erred in refusing to grant Board's motion for JNOV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n FINNEY, C.J., and MOORE, A.J., ooncur. TOAL and  , JJ., dissenting\r\nin separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\np.27\r\n\r\nGASTINEAU v. MURPHY AND BEAUFORT COUNTY \r\n\r\n TOAL, A.J.: I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n In ruling on motions for a directed verdict or judgment non obstante\r\nveredicto, the trial court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\nin the light most favorable to the non-moving party, anti if it is susceptible\r\nof more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the\r\njury.  Unlimited Services, Inc. v. Macklen Enterprises, Inc., 303 S.C. 384, 401\r\nS.E.2d 153 (1991).  The majority opinion does not utilize this standard.\r\nInstead, it takes a view of the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\nMental Retardation Board.  I find that although there was not direct.\r\nevidence offered, there was ample circumstantial evidence presented below to\r\nwarrant submission to the jury the. issue of whether Gastineau was\r\nterminated because of his complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Gastineau reported possible safety and wage violations concerning\r\nhandicapped clients who worked with the Beaufort County Rehabilitation\r\nCenter.  He was discharged shortly after his whistleblowing.  These violations\r\nrelated to handicapped individuals who had been hired by the husband of\r\nLeigh Murphy -- the Executive Director of the Mental Retardation Board.\r\nGastineau informed Alice Shook of the South Carolina Department of Mental\r\nRetardation about the possible violations.  Shook, in turn, informed her\r\nsupervisors.  These supervisors decided to send Gary Hudson to conduct an\r\ninspection of the Rehabilitation Center.  Hudson conducted the inspection;\r\nunfortunately, he died prior to trial.  No written report of his visit was found.\r\nFurthermore, Gastineau's wife, who worked with the Rehabilitation Center         .9\r\nhad expressed concerns to her supervisors about the potential violations.\r\nThese supervisors, according to Mrs. Gastineau, had stated that they would\r\ndiscuss the matter with Leigh Murphy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The circumstances of this case, considered in the aggregate and viewed\r\nin the light most favorable to Gastineau, create a factual issue as to what\r\nMrs. Murphy knew and whether she fired Gastineau because of his\r\nwhistleblowing.  The majority is, in effect, acting as a thirteenth juror in\r\nreaching its conclusion, rather than determining if there was sufficient\r\nevidence for the matter to be submitted for the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Moreover, evidence does not support the position that Gastineau was\r\nterminated for good cause.  He had been made a permanent employee after\r\na six-month probationary period.  Shortly after becoming a permanent\r\nemployee, he was fired.  Although his evaluations were below expectations in\r\nsome areas, they exceeded expectations in others.  Yet, he was suddenly\r\nterminated after he disclosed the potentially damaging information about the\r\n\r\n\r\np.28\r\n\r\nGASTINEAU v. MURPHY AND BEAUFORT COUNTY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhandicapped clients.  The Mental Retardation Board cannot grant Gastineau\r\na permanent position, based on his employment record, and at the same time\r\nclaim to fire him for \"good cause\" on the basis of the identical record.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I would affirm the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the trial court's\r\nruling.  This was clearly a case for the jury to decide.  I would uphold its\r\nverdict of $375,000 in favor of Gastineau.  No challenge is made to the\r\namount awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNETT, A. J. , concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 In footnote 5 of its opinion, the majority asserts that Beaufort County\r\npersonnel policies dictated that employees were \"automatically\" given\r\npermanent status after a six-month evaluation.  There is no record citation\r\nto support this statement.       This statement overlooks the fact that by\r\ndefinition a \"probationary period\" implies not automatic employment, but\r\nrather employment conditioned upon demonstration of fitness for a job.  If\r\nGastineau's record was as bad as was claimed, then surely he would not have\r\nbeen able to meet the requirements of his probationary period.  He was\r\nevaluated shortly before the end of his six-month probationary period; he\r\nbecame a permanent employee at the six-month point; and he was terminated\r\nthereafter.  The fact that the majority and dissent see these facts differently\r\nillustrates dramatically why this matter is a question of fact to be resolved\r\nby a jury.\r\n\r\n\r\np.29\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24801","title":"State v.

KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n In early July 1994, sixteen-year-old Kelsey was staying with his friend,\r\nseventeen-year-old Mike Kirchner in Martinez, Georgia. At the time,\r\nKirchner's father was away from home on business.  On Monday, July 11,\r\n1994, Kirchner left to go to work, leaving Kelsey, seventeen-year-old Geoffrey\r\nPayne, and seventeen-year-old Jamie Lynn Lee (\"Defendants\") alone in the\r\nhouse.  Defendants decided to manufacture homemade pipe bombs.  They\r\ninitially constructed a bomb using copper tubing and g-un powder extracted\r\nfrom firecrackers.  They detonated the bomb near a tree in Kirchner's\r\nbackyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Defendants then decided to construct more sophisticated pipe bombs.\r\nTo accomplish this, they shoplifted pipe material and shotgun shells from a\r\nnearby hardware store and Wal-Mart.  Under the direction of Kelsey, they\r\nbuilt three galvanized steel pipe bombs, one of which they detonated in\r\nKirchner's backyard.  The explosion produced a crater approximately four\r\ninches deep and one foot wide.  It left bomb fragments in the side of\r\nKirchner's house and in a nearby privacy fence.  Kelsey placed the other two\r\nunexploded bombs in his travel bag inside Kirchner's house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Later that evening, Defendants gathered at Kirchner's house for a\r\nparty.  In addition to Defendants, the following individuals showed up for the\r\nparty: Tom Wurtzinger, April Reese, Tommy Speigel, and Joey Ingram.\r\nEveryone was drinking beer.  At around midnight, Lee and Payne left the\r\nparty to go to a nearby Texaco station, a popular \"hang-out\" area among local\r\nteens.  When Lee and Payne arrived at the station, they spotted Melanie\r\nRichey standing near a telephone booth.  They noticed something was wrong\r\nwith her foot.  In the process of sneaking out of her house to meet with a\r\nfriend, Richey had severely cut her foot.  Lee and Payne offered to take\r\nRichey to Kirchner's house in order to clean and bandage her injuries.\r\nRichey accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Lee, Payne, and Richey returned to Kirchner's house at around 1:30\r\na.m. Lee and Payne helped Richey bandage her foot and then all three re-\r\njoined the party.    Soon thereafter, Payne and Richey went outside on\r\nKirchner's back porch where Payne repeatedly tried to coax Richey into\r\nhaving sexual intercourse with him.  Richey refused Payne's advances.  At\r\nseveral points during the night, Payne expressed to Lee his frustration over\r\nRichey's intransigence.  Kelsey testified that at one point he overheard Payne\r\ntell Lee that he was so mad he could kill Richey.\r\n\r\n\r\np.31\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Payne instructed Lee to crush up a tablet of \"Ecstacy,\" a mild\r\nhallucinogen.  Payne poured the powder into a mixture of tea and water in\r\norder to hide the taste of the drug.  Payne gave the drink to Richey and told\r\nher it would help calm a stomach-ache she had been complaining about\r\nearlier in the evening.  Payne did not tell her that the drink was laced with\r\nEcstacy.  Kelsey testified that while this was going on, he was resting on the\r\nfloor by the stereo and occasionally changing the music selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n At around 3:30 a.m., Defendants decided to take Richey home.  While\r\nRichey was waiting for Defendants outside of Kirchner's house, Payne asked\r\nLee to get something to knock Richey out with.  Lee retrieved a wrench from\r\nKirchner's garage.  Payne then suggested that Kelsey bring the unexploded\r\npipe bombs.  Kelsey complied by retrieving the bombs from his travel bag.\r\nKelsey testified that he was unaware, at the time, of what Payne actually\r\nintended to do with the wrench and bombs.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Defendants and Richey then got into Lee's car, ostensibly to take\r\nRichey home.  Lee was driving, Kelsey was in the passenger seat, and Payne\r\nand Richey were in the backseat.  Although Richey had given them directions\r\nto her house, Lee detoured in the opposite direction.  Richey asked where\r\nthey were going; Payne replied that they were going to drive around for a\r\nwhile.  Lee eventually drove across the Georgia border and into South\r\nCarolina.  Lee testified that the music was \"obscenely\" loud in the car, and\r\nhe was going about 90 m.p.h.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Soon after entering South Carolina, Lee noticed his tachometer go from\r\n4200 to 6000 r.p.m. Lee looked down at the gear shift and discovered\r\nRichey's foot had knocked the gear into neutral.  Lee turned around and saw\r\nthat Payne had Richey in a \"strangle hold type position.\" Lee continued to\r\ndrive.  A few minutes later, Lee \"heard two quick, empty thud type sounds.\"\r\nHe again turned around and saw that Payne still had Richey in a strangle\r\nhold.  Lee further testified that Payne had the wrench in his hand.  Kelsey\r\ntestified that he had also turned around and saw that Richey's body was\r\nlimp, her face was pale, and her lips were blue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A few moments later, Payne leaned forward to tell Lee to turn the\r\nmusic down.  According to Lee's testimony, Payne stated, \"I'm pretty sure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Kelsey testified that he assumed Payne wanted to blow up mail boxes\r\nwith the pipe bombs.  As for the wrench, he thought Payne wanted to steal\r\na car bumper to give to Kirchner's girlfriend because her bumper had been\r\ndamaged earlier in a wreck with Lee's car.\r\n\r\n\r\np.32\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\nshe's knocked out, guys.\" Payne then instructed Lee to go to \"Scary Bridge\"\r\nwhich crossed over Stevens Creek, the boundary line between Edgefield and\r\nMcCormick counties.  Lee drove to the bridge where he parked the car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Defendants got out of the car, leaving Richey in the backseat.  Payne\r\ninformed Lee and Kelsey that he was going to have sex with Richey.  Payne\r\ntook off his clothes and Richey's shorts.  A few moments later, Lee warned\r\nPayne that a car was corning.  Defendants quickly got back into Lee's car and\r\nbegan driving.  After the approaching vehicle passed, Lee turned the car\r\naround and went back to the bridge.  Lee testified that Richey was\r\nunconscious the entire time, and \"she was definitely alive.\" Kelsey, on the\r\nother hand, testified that he had checked Richey's pulse, and he believed she\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Lee once again drove away from the bridge.  He got approximately 100\r\nfeet down the road when Payne told him to stop the car.  Defendants pulled\r\nRichey out of the car and carried her into the woods and up an embankment\r\nwhere they placed her on the ground.  Lee returned to the car.  Payne and\r\nKelsey remained by Richey's body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey testified that while he was standing over Richey's body, Payne\r\ninstructed him to place a pipe bomb into Richey's mouth.  Kelsey complied.\r\nPayne then lit the fuse, and the two ran.  A few seconds later, the bomb\r\nexploded.  Defendants returned to Kirchner's house where they fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Defendants were eventually arrested and charged with Richey's murder.\r\nKelsey was arrested in Maryland and brought back to South Carolina to\r\nstand trial.  Kelsey's case was transferred from family court to the Court of\r\nGeneral Sessions where Kelsey and Payne were tried together as adults.\r\nPayne was found guilty of murder and criminal conspiracy.  Kelsey was found\r\nguilty of murder, possession of a pipe bomb, and criminal conspiracy.  Kelsey\r\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and consecutive sentences of\r\nfive years for possession of a pipe bomb and criminal conspiracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKelsey appeals his conviction, raising the following issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Did the trial court err in denying Kelsey's directed verdict motions\r\nbecause there was insufficient proof that Kelsey was guilty of murder\r\nand criminal conspiracy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Did the family court err in transferring jurisdiction over Kelsey's\r\ncase to the Court of General Sessions?\r\n\r\n\r\np.33\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) Did the trial court err in denying Kelsey's motion for a change of\r\nvenue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) Did the trial court err in failing to declare a mistrial when\r\nPayne's attorney pitted Kelsey's testimony against a police officer's\r\ntestimony?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) Did the trial court err in not allowing testimony and introduction\r\nof evidence to rebut the State's innuendos that Kelsey's statement was\r\nnot given in earnest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) Did the trial court err in precluding Kelsey from introducing\r\nPayne's statement into evidence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7) Did the trial court err in not allowing Kelsey to admit evidence\r\nregarding codefendant Payne?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(8) Did the trial court err in denying Kelsey's motion for severance?\r\n\r\n\r\n(9) Did the trial court err in denying Kelsey's motion for a mistrial\r\nwhen Payne's attorney cross-examined Kelsey about prior bad acts\r\nthat allegedly occurred in Georgia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(10) Did the trial court err in admitting a diagram and photographs of\r\nthe crime scene into evidence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(11) Did the trial court err in failing to give proper conspiracy and mere\r\npresence instructions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(12) Did the trial court err in refusing to charge the jury on the law of\r\nmistake of fact?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\n\r\nI.   DIRECTED VERDICT MOTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in denying his directed verdict\r\nmotions because there was insufficient proof that he was guilty of murder\r\nand criminal conspiracy.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the State's case in chief, the defense moved for directed\r\n\r\n\r\np.34\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nverdicts on the murder and conspiracy charges, arguing the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to support these charges.  The court denied the motions.  The\r\ndefense again moved for directed verdicts on murder and conspiracy at the\r\nend of its case.  The court again denied the motions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence\r\nmust be viewed in the light most favorable to the State, and if there is any\r\ndirect evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending\r\nto prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that the case\r\nwas properly submitted to the jury. State v. Rowell, 326 S.C. 313, 487\r\nS.E.2d 185 (1997); State v. Venters, 300 S.C. 260, 387 S.E.2d 270 (1990);\r\nState v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888 (1989).  In ruling on a\r\nmotion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence\r\nof evidence, not its weight. State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 274, 400 S.E.2d 131\r\n(1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA .  MURDER\r\n\r\n\r\n Murder is \"the killing of any person with malice aforethought, either\r\nexpress or implied.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (1985).  \"Malice\" is the\r\nwrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved spirit\r\nintent on doing wrong. State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. 127, 352 S.E.2d 480\r\n(1987).  Malice may be implied from the defendant's use of a deadly weapon.\r\nState v. Campbell, 287 S.C. 377, 339 S.E.2d 109 (1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In the instant case, we find there was sufficient evidence to submit the\r\nmurder charge to the jury.  The following evidence supports our conclusion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (1) Lee's testimony that Kelsey essentially masterminded the\r\nconstruction of the pipe bombs at Kirchner's house on July 11; that Kelsey\r\nand Payne were alone together in the woods with Richey's body; that Lee\r\nbelieved Richey was definitely alive, but unconscious, while in the car; and\r\nthat Kelsey and Payne were running out of the woods away from Richey's\r\nbody when the pipe bomb exploded;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (2) SLED agent Joseph Powell's testimony that metal fragments found\r\nat the crime scene matched fragments found at Kirchner's house;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (3) the forensic pathologist's testimony that the explosion was the more\r\nprobable cause of death;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) April Reese's and Tom Wurtzinger's testimony corroborating Lee's\r\n\r\n\r\np.35\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatements concerning the events that took place at Kirchner's house on July\r\n11 &amp; 12; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (5) Kelsey's admission that he was the one who placed the pipe bomb\r\ninto Richey's mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Therefore, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to\r\nthe State, the trial court correctly denied Kelsey's motion for a directed\r\nverdict on the murder charge.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB .     CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n Conspiracy is defined as the \"combination between two or more persons\r\nfor the purpose of accomplishing a criminal or unlawful object or an object\r\nneither criminal nor unlawful by criminal or unlawful means.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 16-17-410 (1985).  To establish the existence of a conspiracy, proof of\r\nan express agreement is not necessary, and direct evidence is not essential,\r\nbut the conspiracy may be sufficiently shown by circumstantial evidence and\r\nthe conduct of the parties. State v. Fleming, 243 S.C. 265, 133 S.E.2d 800\r\n(1963).    In State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 385 S.E.2d 839 (1989), the\r\ndefendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a\r\ndirected verdict on a conspiracy charge.  We disagreed, finding that the\r\nfollowing facts tended to prove the defendant's guilt: evidence that defendant\r\nknew codefendant; defendant was seen running from the area where the\r\nvictim's body was found; bloodhounds had tracked the victim's scent to the\r\ncodefendant's house; arid defendant had given a written statement stating\r\nthat he agreed to be a lookout for codefendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In this case, evidence indicated that Kelsey was instrumental in\r\nconstructing the pipe bombs at Kirchner's house; that Kelsey was with Lee\r\nand Payne on the night of the murder; that Kelsey helped Payne carry\r\nRichey into the woods; that Kelsey and Payne were alone together in the\r\nwoods with Richey's body; and that Kelsey placed the pipe bomb into Richey's\r\nmouth. We therefore find the evidence was sufficient to subrnit the\r\nconspiracy charge to the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Kelsey also argues that he should be exonerated because there was\r\nevidence supporting the defense of duress.  However, in South Carolina,\r\nduress is not a defense to murder. State v. Rocheville, 310 S.C. 20, 425\r\nS.E.2d 32 (1993).\r\n\r\n\r\np.36\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the family court erred in transferring jurisdiction\r\nover his case to the Court of General Sessions.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In making its motion to transfer jurisdiction, the State relied on S.C.\r\n Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-430(4) &amp; (6) (1985).  Section 20-7-430(4) provides that the\r\n family court may transfer jurisdiction if that court finds \"it contrary to the\r\n best interest of such child or of the public to retain jurisdiction,3 After\r\n conducting a hearing on the State's transfer motion, the family court ordered\r\n jurisdiction over Kelsey's case be transferred to the Court of General\r\n Sessions.  The family court found it was in the best interest of Kelsey and\r\n the community to have Kelsey tried as an adult.  The family court's findings\r\n were based primarily upon criteria established in the appendix to the United\r\n States Supreme Court case of Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 86 S. Ct.\r\n 1045, 15 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1966).4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3Section 20-7-430(4) provides, in full: \r\n\r\n If a child sixteen years of age or older is charged with an offense\r\n which would be a misdemeanor or felony if committed by an\r\n adult and if the court, after full investigation, deems it contrary\r\n to the best interest of such child or of the public to retain\r\n jurisdiction, the court may, in its discretion, acting as committing\r\n magistrate, bind over such child for proper criminal proceedings\r\n to any court which would have trial jurisdiction of such offense\r\n if committed by an adult.\r\n\r\n\r\n 4In Kent, the Court established the following criteria for determining\r\nwhether jurisdiction should be waived under the District of Columbia\r\nJuvenile Court Act:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and\r\nwhether the protection of the community requires waiver.\r\n(2) Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive,\r\nviolent, premeditated, or willful manner.\r\n(3) Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against\r\nproperty, greater weight being given to offenses against persons\r\nespecially if personal injury resulted.\r\n(4) The prosecutive merit of the complaint, i.e., whether there is\r\nevidence upon which a Grand Jury may be expected to return an\r\nindictment (to be determined by consultation with the United\r\n\r\n\r\np.37\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n It is the responsibility of the family court to include in its waiver of\r\njurisdiction order a sufficient statement of reasons for, and considerations\r\nleading to, that decision.  Conclusory statements, or a mere recitation of\r\nstatutory requirements, without further explanation will not suffice.  In re\r\nSullivan, 274 S.C. 544, 265 S.E.2d 527 (1980).  The serious nature of the\r\noffense is a major factor in the transfer decision.  See Sanders v. State, 281\r\nS.C. 53, 314 S.E.2d 319 (1984)(transfer upheld where defendant was charged\r\nwith two counts of murder and two counts of assault and battery with intent\r\nto kill); State v. Wright, 269 S.C. 414, 237 S.E.2d 764 (1977)(transfer upheld\r\nwhere defendants were charged with armed robbery and assault and battery\r\nwith intent to kill).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In this case, the family court's transfer hearing was extensive.  It not\r\nonly included the testimony of relevant witnesses, including Kelsey, but also\r\nthe submission of a lengthy preadjudicatory transfer evaluation.  Additionally,\r\nthe family court's transfer order was detailed. and raised the following points:\r\n(1) Kelsey was charged with the serious and violent offense of murder, and\r\nthe victim was a young girl; (2) it was likely that the Grand Jury would\r\nreturn an indictment against Kelsey; (3) Kelsey's two codefendant's were\r\ngoing to be tried in the Court of General Sessions; (4) if tried as a minor,\r\nKelsey would only get 24 to 54 months if convicted of the murder charge --\r\nthis was not in the community's best interest due to the seriousness of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStates Attorney).\r\n(5) The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense\r\nin one court when the juvenile's associates in the alleged offense\r\nare adults who will be charged with a crime in the U.S. District\r\nCourt for the District of Columbia.\r\n(6) The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined\r\nby consideration of his home, environmental situation, emotional\r\nattitude and pattern of living.\r\n(7) The record and previous history of the juvenile, including\r\nprevious contacts with the Youth Aid Division, other law\r\nenforcement agencies, juvenile courts and other jurisdictions,\r\nprior periods of probation to this Court, or prior commitments to\r\njuvenile institutions.\r\n(8) The prospects for adequate protection of the public and the\r\nlikelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is\r\nfound to have committed the alleged offense by the use of\r\nprocedures, services and facilities currently available to the\r\nJuvenile Court.\r\n\r\n\r\np.38\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrime; and (5) Kelsey would have less of a chance of rehabilitation in the\r\njuvenile justice system because his sentence under that system would be\r\n brief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We therefore find the family court properly transferred jurisdiction to\r\nthe Court of General Sessions pursuant to section 20-7-430.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  CHANGE OF VENUE\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\r\nchange of venue due to the enormous amount of pretrial publicity\r\nsurrounding his case.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n During voir dire, the trial judge asked all of the prospective jurors\r\nwhether they had heard anything about the case through the news media.\r\nOf the ninety prospective jurors, seventy-nine indicated that they had heard\r\nsomething about the case.  The trial judge then asked these prospective\r\njurors whether they could put aside what they had heard and base their\r\nverdict on the evidence presented at trial.  Thirty-five indicated that they\r\ncould not and were consequently excused by the trial judge.  The trial judge\r\nfurther questioned three of the remaining jurors after defense counsel\r\nexpressed concern about their initial responses.   After voir dire was\r\ncompleted, the defense renewed its motion for a change of venue.  The trial\r\njudge denied the motion, stating:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy sound instinct though tells me that just because these people\r\nhave heard about the case doesn't have to necessarily mean that\r\nthey have formed some opinion about the case.  To do that I\r\nthink would have to, in essence, assume that they believed\r\neverything they had seen or read and that, in essence, they were\r\nsome sort of automatons that were dictated to by the news\r\nmedia.  I don't think I can go that far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the twelve jurors finally seated, three had not heard anything about the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the media attention surrounding his case was so\r\ngreat that it precluded any possibility of him obtaining a fair trial by an\r\nimpartial jury as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5Section 20-7-430 was repealed by 1996 Act No. 383, Â§ 2, effective July\r\n1, 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\np.39\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution.  Kelsey further argues that this prejudice is demonstrated by\r\nthe fact that such a high number of prospective jurors indicated, during voir\r\ndire, that they had heard something about the case.  Kelsey suggests that all\r\nof the prospective jurors not excused during voir dire were in some way\r\nsubconsciously affected by the high volume of media coverage surrounding the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A motion for a change of venue is addressed to the sound discretion of\r\nthe trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. State\r\nv. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990). When the trial judge bases\r\nhis ruling upon an adequate voir dire examination of the jurors, his\r\nconclusion that the objectivity of the jury panel has not been polluted by\r\noutside influence will not be disturbed absent extraordinary circumstances.\r\nState v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997); State v. Caldwell, 300\r\nS.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816; State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. 1, 292 S.E.2d 581\r\n(1982), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406\r\nS.E.2d 315 (1991).  Mere exposure to pretrial publicity does not automatically\r\ndisqualify a prospective juror. State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d\r\n816.  When jurors have been exposed to such publicity, a denial of a change\r\nof venue is not error where jurors are found to have the ability to lay aside\r\nany impressions or opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence\r\npresented at trial.  Id. Moreover, it is the defendant's burden to demonstrate\r\nactual juror prejudice as a result of news accounts of the defendant's case.\r\nState v. Owens, 293 S.C. 161, 359 S.E.2d 275 (1987).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey cites Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d\r\n751 (1961) and Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d\r\n847 (1984), for the proposition that pretrial publicity may be so severe as to\r\ncreate a presumption of prejudice in the community, and therefore, make it\r\nimpossible for the defendant to receive a fair trial.  However, in Dowd, the\r\nCourt stated there was no requirement that jurors -be totally ignorant of the\r\nfacts and issues involved in the case.  \"It is sufficient if the juror can lay\r\naside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence\r\npresented in court.\" Dowd, 366 U.S. at 723, 81 S. Ct. at 1643, 6 L. Ed. 2d\r\nat 756.  The Court in Dowd ultimately concluded that the pretrial publicity\r\nwas unduly prejudicial to the defendant because eight of the twelve jurors\r\nfinally placed in the jury box expressed, during voir dire, their belief that the\r\ndefendant was in fact  guilty.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6In Dowd, the pretrial news coverage was extremely intense and\r\nnegative toward the defendant.    The coverage included details of the\r\ndefendant's background, including references to crimes he committed when\r\n\r\n\r\np.40\r\n\r\nSTATE  V.  KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In the instant case, there was no indication that any of the jurors\r\nfinally seated had formed a pretrial opinion that Kelsey was guilty.  Nine of\r\nthe twelve jurors admitted they had been exposed to some pretrial media\r\ncoverage, but they told the trial judge they could put aside what they had\r\nheard and render a verdict based on the evidence presented at trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \"[A defendant's] mere assertion that the jurors could have been\r\nsubconsciously affected by. . .media exposure is insufficient to show\r\nprejudice.\" State v. Owens, 293 S.C. at 167, 359 S.E.2d at 278.  Kelsey has\r\nnot gone beyond this mere assertion to show actual prejudice in his case.\r\nAlthough media coverage was widespread and intense before Kelsey's trial,\r\nthere was no indication that the trial court's voir dire failed to produce an\r\nimpartial jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  PITTING OF WITNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial\r\nwhen Payne's attorney attempted to pit Kelsey's testimony against a police\r\nofficer's testimony.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey was arrested by officer Slavin in Maryland.  At trial, Slavin\r\ntestified that when Kelsey was detained in his police car, Kelsey asked if he\r\nwas going to be treated as an adult or juvenile.  Slavin told him he would be\r\ntreated as an adult.  Slavin then testified, \"[Kelsey] wanted to know why\r\nbecause he said he was a juvenile when he did it.\" The State also introduced\r\ninto evidence a copy of Slavin's incident report to corroborate his testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n During Payne's cross-examination of Kelsey, the following exchange\r\noccurred:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.    Have you read that document [Slavin's incident report] you\r\n just denied ever seeing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.    I have never read through this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.    You have never seen anything like that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe was a juvenile, convictions for arson almost 20 years previously, and\r\nburglary and AWOL court-martial charges.  The news media further accused\r\nhim of being a parole violator, announced his police line-up identification, his\r\nconfession to the six murders, and his offer to plead g-uilty.  Dowd, 366 U.S.\r\nat 725, 81 S.. Ct. at 1644.\r\n\r\n\r\np.41\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE   V. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.    No, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.    Anyone who says you have would, of course, be mistaken\r\n or lying; is that correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKelsey's attorney immediately objected, arguing the question improperly\r\npitted Kelsey's testimony against Slavin's testimony.  Kelsey moved for a\r\nmistrial.  The trial judge sustained Kelsey's objection, but denied his motion\r\nfor a mistrial.  Payne's counsel continued with the cross-examination of\r\nKelsey:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.    So when [Slavin] said that you said, \"I was juvenile when\r\n I did it,\" Mr. Slavin was incorrect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A.   Yes, sir, he was.\r\n\r\n\r\nKelsey again objected on the same grounds as before.  The trial judge\r\nsustained the objection but denied Kelsey's motion for a mistrial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion\r\nof the trial judge and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  State v. Crim, 327 S.C. 254, 489 S.E.2d 478 (1997); State v.\r\nDawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 377 S.E.2d 298 (1989).  The power of the court to\r\ndeclare a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest caution and for plain\r\nand obvious causes stated into the record by the trial judge. State v.\r\nDawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 377 S.E.2d 298.  The granting of a motion for a\r\nmistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident\r\nis so grievous that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way. 75B\r\nAm. Jur. 2d Trial Â§ 1706 at 491 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We first note that any prejudice to Kelsey could have been removed by\r\nthe trial court striking the testimony and giving a curative instruction to the\r\njury.  See State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996)(an instruction\r\nto disregard incompetent evidence usually is deemed to have cured the error\r\nin its admission unless on the facts of the particular case it is probable that\r\nnotwithstanding such instruction or withdrawal the accused was prejudiced).\r\nHowever, Kelsey's attorney failed to make such a motion before the trial\r\ncourt.  See 75 Am.  Jur. 2d Trial Â§ 467 at 642 (a motion for mistrial does not\r\nautomatically include a motion to strike as a lessor prayer for relief).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNonetheless, we find that Kelsey was not unfairly prejudiced by the\r\n\r\n\r\np.42\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntestimony.  Although it is improper for an attorney to cross-examine a\r\nwitness in such a manner as to force him to attack the veracity of another\r\nwitness, improper \"pitting\" constitutes reversible error only if the accused was\r\nunfairly prejudiced. State v. Sapps, 295 S.C. 484, 369 S.E.2d 145 (1988).\r\nVVhlle Kelsey's credibility was at issue in the case, Kelsey admitted on direct\r\nexamination that he had, in fact, placed the pipe bomb into Richey's mouth.\r\nThe critical issue for the jury to decide was whether Richey was alive or dead\r\nwhen Kelsey committed this act.  The above colloquy between Kelsey and\r\nPayne's attorney did not directly relate to this issue.  Kelsey merely disputed\r\ntelling Officer Slavin that he was a juvenile when he \"did it.\" Any prejudice\r\nto Kelsey was minimal and does not warrant reversal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n V. PRIOR STATEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in denying his right to\r\nintroduce a prior statement in order to defend against the State's allegation\r\nthat he testified untruthfully during his testimony before the jury.  We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n During the State's cross-examination of Kelsey, the solicitor emphasized\r\nthat Kelsey's trial testimony was inconsistent with testimony he had given\r\nat the December 5, 1994 family cour-t waiver hearing and with statements he\r\nhad given to SLED agent Dan Choate on September 29, 1994.  In response,\r\nKelsey called Choate to the stand and attempted to elicit testimony from him\r\nconcerning Kelsey's prior September statement.  The State objected, arguing\r\nthe defense was trying to introduce a prior consistent statement which was\r\nimpermissible under Rule 801(d)(1), SCRE.  Kelsey's attorney responded,\r\narguing that he was entitled to have the entire inconsistent statement\r\nintroduced so that it could be viewed in context.  The trial judge sustained\r\nthe State's objection.  Kelsey did not proffer any of the excluded testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Generally, where a portion of a witness's prior inconsistent statement\r\nhas been introduced to impeach that witness, the entire statement is\r\nadmissible in rebuttal to explain the inconsistency.  See 98 C.J.S. Witnesses\r\nÂ§ 622 at 636 (1957); Wigmore On Evidence Â§ 1045 (Chadbourn rev. 1970).\r\nHowever, the mere mention of a conversation or statement does not\r\nautomatically entitle the opponent to bring out the other parts.  Remaining\r\nportions which are not relevant or material in the explanation of the\r\ninconsistency are not admissible.  See People v. Cowper, 496 N.E.2d 729 (111.\r\nApp.  Ct. 1986); State v. Eugenio, 565 N.W.2d 798 (Wis.  Ct.  App. 1997); 98\r\nC.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 622 at 637.  The trial court has broad discretion in\r\ndetermining whether to admit such evidence.  See State v. Daly, 798 S.W.2d\r\n\r\n\r\np.43\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n725 (Mo.  Ct.  App. 1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n At trial, the solicitor asked Kelsey if Richey's mouth was bleeding\r\ninside the car.  Kelsey responded that there was a small trace of blood on\r\nRichey's mouth.  The following colloquy then took place between Kelsey and\r\nthe solicitor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.    Mr. Choate over here. You had a conversation with Mr. Choate\r\n and your lawyer was there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.    Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.    Do you remember Mr. Choate said, \"Mr. Kelsey, was there any\r\n blood on Melanie or anywhere in that car?\" You said, \"No, sir, it\r\n wasn't.\" Didn't you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.    I don't remember that brief conversation. I mean. I tried to write\r\n down exactly what we talked about right afterwards.  I said we\r\n had a brief conversation before and that then they gave me the\r\n forms and I wrote it down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n At trial, Kelsey's attorney argued that Kelsey had a right to have the\r\nentire statement introduced so that it could be viewed in context.  However,\r\nthere was no attempt to explain why the other portions of the September\r\nstatement were relevant or material in explaining the inconsistency.\r\nAdditionally, Kelsey failed to proffer any of the excluded testimony.  See\r\nState v. Anderson, 304 S.C. 551, 406 S.E.2d 152 (1991)(where no proffer of\r\nexcluded testimony is made, the Court is unable to determine whether the\r\nappellant was prejudiced by the trial judge's refusal to admit the testimony\r\ninto evidence).  We therefore find that the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in sustaining the State's objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. CODEFENDANT'S STATEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n At trial, Kelsey's attorney called F.B.I. agent Harold Harrison to the\r\nstand to testify.  Kelsey sought to elicit testimony from Harrison concerning\r\nstatements Payne made to the F.B.I. during its investigation of Richey's\r\ndeath.  Payne's attorney objected, arguing Payne's credibility could not be\r\nimpeached unless Payne took the stand.  Kelsey's attorney responded, stating\r\nthat the purpose of the testimony was to rebut Payne's theory that Kelsey\r\nhad co-opted Payne's statement and made it his own.  Kelsey made an in\r\ncarnera proffer of the testimony.  The proffer revealed that the interview did\r\n\r\n\r\np.44\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot contain any admission of guilt by Payne, but did discuss the sequence of\r\nevents surrounding the crime.  The trial judge sustained the objection, stating\r\nthat Payne might still present a defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Even if Payne's statements were relevant as rebuttal evidence, Kelsey\r\nwas not prejudiced by the trial judge's ruling.  Lee had already testified that\r\nPayne fabricated his story and had instructed Lee to \"Rip everything around\"\r\nand tell the authorities that Kelsey killed Richey if questioned.  Moreover,\r\nLee's story at trial was more consistent with Kelsey's version of events than\r\nwith Payne's.  Thus, even if Payne's statements were relevant, they were, at\r\nbest, needless presentation of cumulative evidence.  See Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.  CODEFENDANT'S PHYSICAL APPEARANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in not allowing him to present\r\nevidence concerning Payne's altered appearance at trial.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n At trial, Kelsey called Mae Guin, a guidance counselor from Payne's\r\nformer high school.  Kelsey's attorney attempted to question Guin about\r\nPayne's changed appearance since high school.  Payne's attorney objected,\r\narguing Payne's altered appearance was irrelevant.  Kelsey argued that\r\nPayne's appearance at trial was an attempt to give the impression that he\r\nwas something he was not.  The trial judge sustained Payne's objection and\r\ngave a curative instruction to the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Evidence regarding the physical condition of a party is admissible if\r\nrelevant to an issue in the case. 29 Am.  Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 560 at 627.  The\r\nonly ground offered by Kelsey to support the introduction of Guin's testimony\r\nwas that Payne was trying be something he was not.  Payne's appearance\r\nwas in no other way relevant to the case.  We hold that the prejudicial effect\r\nof such evidence substantially outweighed any probative value it may have\r\nhad.  See Rule 403, SCRE.  Thus, it was properly excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.  SEVERANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\r\nseverance in the case.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Before trial, Payne's attorney moved to have separate trials.  Kelsey did\r\nnot join in the motion.  The trial judge denied Payne's motion.  After the\r\ndefense rested its case, Kelsey's attorney moved for a mistrial and argued\r\nthat Kelsey was entitled to a severance.  The trial judge denied the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.45\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In South Carolina, crirrlinal defendants who are jointly tried for murder\r\nare not entitled to separate trials as a matter of right. State v. Holland, 261\r\nS.C. 488, 201 S.E.2d 118 (1973); State v. Crowe, 258 S.C. 258, 188 S.E.2d 379\r\n(1972).  Motions for a severance and separate trial are addressed to the\r\ndiscretion of the trial court. State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118\r\n(1997); State v. Chaffee, 285 S.C. 21, 328 S.E.2d 464 (1984), overruled on\r\nother grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nAbsent a showing of an abuse of discretion, this Court will not disturb the\r\ntrial court's ruling on appeal. State v. Thompson, 279 S.C. 405, 308 S.E.2d\r\n364 (1983).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that severance should have been granted based on the\r\nprejudice discussed in issues 5, 6, and 7 of this appeal.  As discussed above,\r\nKelsey was not unfairly prejudiced by any of the trial court's rulings\r\ndiscussed in issues 5, 6, and 7, nor was he unfairly prejudiced in any other\r\nway.  At most, any prejudice was incidental and therefore insufficient to\r\ndemonstrate an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in denying\r\nseverance.  See United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914 (Ist Cir. 1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.  PRIOR BAD ACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a\r\nmistrial when Payne's attorney cross-examined him about prior bad acts that\r\nallegedly occurred in Georgia.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On cross-examination, Payne's attorney asked Kelsey if he had had any\r\nlegal problems or been arrested before July 12, 1994, in Georgia.  Kelsey\r\nresponded that he had not.  Payne's attorney then asked Kelsey if he had\r\nhad any legal problems after July 12, 1994.  Before Kelsey could answer,\r\nKelsey's attorney objected.  Payne's attorney made an in camera proffer of\r\nthe testimony.  Kelsey was asked whether he had ever been charged with the\r\ncrime of forgery.  Kelsey responded that he was not aware of any such\r\ncharges.  Payne's attorney withdrew the question.  Kelsey moved for a\r\nmistrial which the trial judge denied.  When the jury returned, the trial\r\njudge gave the following curative instruction: \"I have stricken the last\r\nquestion.  Let me be sure and remind you that an attorney's question is not\r\nevidence and I have stricken all that.  So you will disregard that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Under Rule 608(b), SCRE, specific instances of the conduct of a witness\r\nmay be inquired into on cross-examination if probative of the witness's\r\ncharacter for truthfulness or untruthfulness.  South Carolina's Rule is\r\nidentical to the Federal rule.  The inquiry under Rule 608(b) is limited to\r\n\r\n\r\np.46\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose specific instances of misconduct which are clearly probative of\r\ntruthfulness or untruthfulness such as forgery, bribery, false pretenses, and\r\nembezzlement.  See Weinstein's Federal Evidence, Character and Conduct of\r\nWitness Â§ 608.12(4)(a-b) (1998).  However, the cross-examiner may not go on\r\na \"fishing expedition\" in the hopes of finding some misconduct. State v.\r\nMcGuire, 272 S.C. 547, 253 S.E.2d 103 (1979).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In this case, Payne's attorney inquired into a prior act of forgery.\r\nWhen Kelsey stated he was not aware of any such charge, Payne's attorney\r\nproperly withdrew the question.  See Rule 609(b), SCRE (specific instances\r\nof conduct may not be -proved by extrinsic evidence).  We hold that any\r\nprejudice to Kelsey was cured by the trial judge's curative instruction to the\r\njury.  See State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (an instruction to\r\ndisregard incompetent evidence usually is deemed to have cured the error in\r\nits admission unless on the facts of the particular case it is probable that\r\nnotwithstanding such instruction or withdrawal the accused was prejudiced).\r\nThus, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for\r\nmistrial.  See State v. Crim, 327 S.C. 254, 489 S.E.2d 478 (decision to deny\r\nmistrial will not be overturned on appeal absent abuse of discretion).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. DIAGRAM &amp; PHOTOGRAPHS\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in admitting State's exhibits 18\r\nand 19 into evidence.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Exhibits 18 and 19 consisted of a diagram of the crime scene and\r\nphotographs of various bone and bomb fragments and clothing found at the\r\nscene.  Kelsey notes that Richey's body was discovered some forty-six days\r\nafter the crime was conunitted.  Kelsey suggests that weather or local fauna\r\ncould have altered the crime scene during this period.  Thus, the State's\r\ndepictions were inaccurate representations of the scene and therefore\r\nprejudicial to Kelsey.  Kelsey also argues the evidence was cumulative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The relevance, materiality, and admissibility of photographs are matters\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court.  If the photographs serve to\r\ncorroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit them. State\r\nv. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996).  A photograph should be\r\nexcluded only if it is calculated to arouse the jury's sympathy or prejudice or\r\nis irrelevant or unnecessary to substantiate facts.  Id. In this case, the\r\nphotographs corroborated other testimony concerning the condition of Richey's\r\nbody as first discovered by police at the crime scene.  Additionally, the\r\nlocation of bone and bomb fragments clearly supported testimony that a bomb\r\n\r\n\r\np.47\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetonated in Richey's mouth.  Kelsey merely hypothesizes that the crime\r\nscene could have been disturbed by natural forces.  We hold that the trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting the exhibits into evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. CONSPIRACY AND MERE PRESENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in failing to give proper\r\nconspiracy and mere presence instructions.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey contends that the trial court's mere presence charge was blended\r\nin so closely with the accomplice liability charge that it was misleading.\r\nKelsey further argues that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the\r\njury that one's mere association with a person who conu-nits a crime does not\r\nmake a defendant an accomplice or a co-conspirator to the guilty perpetrator.\r\nThe trial court's instruction provided, in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow of course, mere presence at the scene is insufficient to prove\r\nsomeone guilty of a crime.  The burden is upon the state to prove\r\nevery element of the crime charged.  If you find after reviewing\r\nall of the evidence that the state has proven that the defendant\r\nwas only present at the scene of the crime and they have not\r\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt any other participation in the\r\ncrime, then you must find a defendant not guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law says that proof of mere presence at the scene of the\r\ncrime is not sufficient to find someone guilty.  But, of course the\r\nlaw also says that the hand of one is the hand of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law says -- that if a person -- if a crime is committed by two\r\nor more persons who are acting together in the commission of a\r\ncrime, then the act of one is the act of both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We find the trial court's charge was not misleading. It clearly\r\nexplained that the prosecution had  to prove every element of the crime and\r\nthat mere presence was not enough to sustain a conviction.  Moreover, the\r\ntrial judge extensively instructed the jury on the requisite criminal intent for\r\neach of the charged crimes.  In charging the jury on conspiracy, the trial\r\njudge explained, \"Before a defendant may be convicted ... it must be proven\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed and that the defendant\r\nwas a knowing party to the conspiracy . . . .\" (emphasis added).  We hold\r\nthat the trial court's instructions, taken as a whole, were adequate.  See\r\nState v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991)(jury instructions must be\r\n\r\n\r\np.48\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidered as a whole and if as a whole, they are free from error, any\r\nisolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible\r\nerror).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.  MISTAKE OF FACT\r\n\r\n\r\n Kelsey argues that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury\r\non the law of mistake of fact.  Kelsey contends that he believed Richey was\r\ndead when he placed the pipe bomb into her mouth.  He asserts that even\r\nif Richey were alive when he did this, his mistaken belief that she was dead\r\nnegates the criminal intent required to be convicted of murder.  Thus, he was\r\nentitled to a jury charge.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Kelsey requested the following jury instruction:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case the state is required to prove beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that the defendant Joe Kelsey was not operating under a\r\nmistake of fact.  If the state can not prove beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that defendant Joe Kelsey knew that the victim was still\r\nalive when the pipe bomb was placed in her mouth, then\r\ndefendant Joe Kelsey is entitled to a verdict of not guilty as to\r\nthe charge of murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A mistake of fact which negates the existence of the mental element of\r\nthe offense, will preclude conviction. 21 Am.  Jur. 2d Criminal Law, Â§ 141 at\r\n276 (1981); William Shepard McAninch, Criminal Law of South Carolina, 542\r\n(1996).  If the particular offense is a general intent crime, the mistake of fact\r\nmust be reasonable.  See State v. Dizon, 390 P.2d 759 (Haw. 1964)(the\r\nmistake must not be due to the negligence or carelessness of the defendant).\r\nMoreover, a trial court is not required to give an instruction on mistake of\r\nfact unless and until the defendant introduces some evidence, direct or\r\ncircumstantial, of a reasonable basis for having made the mistake. United\r\nStates v. Norquay, 987 F.2d 475 (8th Cir. 1993).\r\n\r\n\r\n It is dubious, at best, to suggest that Kelsey's belief in this regard was\r\nobjectively reasonable.  Despite this, there are more fundamental reasons for\r\nrejecting Kelsey's argument.  First, the trial judge extensively charged. the\r\njury on the requisite criminal intent for murder.  The trial judge's instruction\r\nprovided, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMurder is the killing of any person with malice aforethought,\r\neither express or implied.  Again, murder is the killing of any\r\n\r\n\r\np.49\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELSEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson with malice aforethought, either express or implied.  Now,\r\nin order to convict these defendants on murder . . . the state\r\nmust prove not only that the defendant killed Melanie Kaye\r\nRichey; but they must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nthey did so with malice aforethought. . . . There must be a\r\ncombination of the previous evil intent and the act producing the\r\nfatal result.  Proof of malice may be express or direct, such as,\r\nwhere there is evidence of previous threats or evidence of lying\r\nin wait.  In other words, circumstances which show directly that\r\nan intent to kill existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court's instructions made clear that the State not only had to prove\r\nthat Kelsey killed Richey, but that he did so with the requisite intent, i.e.,\r\nwith malice aforethought.  Therefore, Kelsey's belief that Richey was dead\r\nwould be part of the determination of whether Kelsey \"intended\" to kill\r\nRichey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We also note that Kelsey's requested jury instruction did not accurately\r\nstate the law in that it failed to provide that Kelsey's mistake of fact must\r\nhave been reasonable.  The proposed charge orily stated that the State must\r\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kelsey was not operating under a\r\nmistake of fact.  Thus, it was not error for the trial court to refuse to give\r\nthe requested jury charge.  See State v. Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 317 S.E.2d 452\r\n(1984)(a trial court does not err in refusing to give a requested jury\r\ninstruction where it does not state the correct law).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the trial court on all issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and        Associate Justice C.

Jones, of Florence; and Barbara\r\nTolson-Haywood, of Hartsville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n BURNETT, A.J.: In this domestic action, respondent, Wilma\r\nR. Poston, was adjudged guilty of contempt for failing to abide by prior\r\norders of the family court.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded\r\nfinding the judge applied the wrong standard of proof in holding\r\nrespondent in criminal contempt. Poston v. Poston, Op.  No. 96-UP-431\r\n\r\n\r\np.51\r\n\r\nPOSTON v. POSTON \r\n\r\n(S.C. Ct.  App. filed November 26, 1996) (Cureton, J. concurring and\r\ndissenting).  We affirm as modified in part; reverse in part; and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The parties were married in 1970.  They had four children.  In\r\n1992, the family court issued a decree of separate maintenance and\r\nsupport and awarded custody of the children to petitioner.  In 1993, the\r\nfamily court terminated respondent's visitation and barred her from\r\nhaving any personal and telephone contact with two of the parties' minor\r\nchildren.  The court also restrained respondent from going within one\r\nblock of the marital home where the children resided and from going to\r\ntheir schools, sporting events and church events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In September 1994, the family court issued an order and rule\r\nto show cause following petitioner's filing of a contempt petition.  At the\r\nhearing, petitioner produced evidence demonstrating respondent violated\r\nthe 1993 order by visiting the home and telephoning the children on\r\nseveral occasions.  In its order issued in 1995, the court found. respondent\r\nwillfully violated the 1993 order.  The family court ruled as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Respondent] is in willful contempt.  She shall be sentenced to\r\n120 days incarceration but may purge herself of contempt by\r\nstrict compliance with this Order and the prior Order -\r\n[December 21, 1993].  An additional restriction shall be\r\nimposed to prohibit [respondent] from coming within 50 yards\r\nof the children; and [respondent] shall be required to pay the\r\nattomey's fees as ordered herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n The Court of Appeals reversed this order finding the family\r\ncourt judge held respondent in criminal contempt and applied the wrong\r\nstandard of proof.  The Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the\r\nfamily court for further proceedings.  Id. Judge Cureton disagreed with\r\nthe majority's holding that respondent was held in criminal contempt.\r\nHowever, he recommended reversing the family court order to the extent it\r\ncan be read to impose sanctions in advance for a violation of the new\r\nrestriction included in the contempt order issued in 1995. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\np.52\r\n\r\nPOSTON v. POSTON \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the family court\r\nheld respondent in criminal contempt?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Did the Court of Appeals err in vacating the award of\r\nattorney's fees to petitioner?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Petitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding\r\nrespondent was held in criminal contempt.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The major factor in determining whether a contempt is civil or\r\ncriminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised, including the\r\nnature of the relief and the purpose for which the sentence is imposed.\r\n17 Am.Jur.2d Contempt Â§ 9 (1990); see also Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. 624,\r\n108 S.Ct. 1423, 99 L.Ed.2d 721 (1988); State v. Magazine, 302 S.C. 55, 393\r\nS.E.2d 385 (1990), abrogated on other grounds by. State v. Easler, 327\r\nS.C. 655, 393 S.E.2d 385 (1997).  The purpose of civil contempt is \"to\r\ncoerce the defendant to do the thing required by the order for the benefit\r\nof the complainant.\" Gompers v. Buck's Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. 418,\r\n441, 31 S.Ct. 492, 498, 55 L.Ed. 797, 806 (1911).  The primary purposes of\r\ncriminal contempt are to preserve the court's authority and to punish for\r\ndisobedience of its orders. State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 447 S.E.2d\r\n213 (Ct.  App. 1994).  \"If it is for civil contempt the punishment is\r\nremedial, and for the benefit of the complainant.  But if it is for criminal\r\ncontempt the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court.\"\r\nHicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. at 631, 108 S.Ct. at 1429, 99 L.Ed.2d at 731\r\n(quoting Gompers v. Buck's Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. at 441, 31 S.Ct.\r\nat 498, 55 L.Ed. at 806).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \"An unconditional penalty is criminal in nature because it is\r\n'solely and exclusively punitive in nature.'\" Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. at\r\n633, 108 S.Ct. at 1430, 99 L.Ed.2d at 732 (citing Penfield Co. v. SEC, 330\r\nU.S. 585, 593, 67 S.Ct. 918, 922, 91 L.Ed. 1117, 1124 (1947)).  \"The relief\r\n'cannot undo or remedy what has been done nor afford any compensation\r\nand the contemnor cannot shorten the term by promising not to repeat his\r\noffense.\"' Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. at 633, 108 S.Ct. at 1430, 99 L.Ed.2d\r\n\r\n\r\np.53\r\n\r\nPOSTON v. POSTON \r\n\r\n at 732 (citing Gompers v. Buck's Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. at 442, 31\r\n S.Ct. at 498, 55 L.Ed. at 806).  \"If the relief provided is a sentence of\r\n imprisonment, . . . it is punitive if the sentence is limited to imprisonment\r\n for a definite period.\" Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. at 632, 108 S.Ct. at 1429,\r\n 99 L.Ed.2d at 731; see also State v. Magazine, supra.  If the sanction is a\r\n fine, it is punitive when it is paid to the court.  However, a fine that is\r\n payable to the court may be remedial when the contemnor can avoid\r\n paying the fine simply by performing the affirmative act required by the\r\n court's order. Hicks v. Feiock, supra; State v. Magazine, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n In civil contempt cases, the sanctions are conditioned on\r\n compliance with the court's order. Hicks v. Feiock, supra; State v.\r\n Magazine, supra. \"The conditional nature of the punishment renders the\r\n relief civil in nature because the contemnor 'can end the sentence and\r\n discharge himself at any moment by doing what he had previously refused\r\n to do.\"' Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. at 633, 108 S.Ct. at 1430, 99 L.Ed.2d\r\n at 732 (citing Gompers v. Buck's Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. at 442, 31\r\n S.Ct. at 498, 55 L.Ed. at 806).  \"If the relief provided is a sentence of\r\n imprisonment, it is remedial if the defendant stands committed unless and\r\n until he performs the affirmative act required by the court's order ......\r\n Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. at 632, 108 S.Ct. at 1429, 99 L.Ed.2d at 731.\r\n \"Those who are imprisoned until they obey the order, 'carry the keys of\r\n their prison in their own pockets.\"' Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. at 633, 108\r\n S.Ct. at 1430, 99 L.Ed.2d at 732 (citing Penfield Co. v. SEC, 330 U.S. at\r\n 590, 67 S.Ct. at 921, 91 L.Ed. at 1123).  If the sanction is a fine, it is\r\n remedial and civil if paid to the complainant even though the contemnor\r\n has no opportunity to purge himself of the fine or if the contemnor can\r\n avoid the fine by complying with the court's order. Hicks v. Felock. supra;\r\n State v. Magazine, supra; see also In re General Motors Corp., 61 F.3d\r\n 256 (4th Cir. 1995), opinion after remand, 110 F.3d 1003 (4th Cir.), cert.\r\n denied,     U.S.    , 118 S.Ct. 61, 139 L.Ed.2d 24 (1997) (remedies for\r\n civil contempt include ordering the contemnor to reimburse the\r\n complainant for losses sustained and for reasonable attorney's fees); 17\r\n Am.Jur.2d Contempt Â§ 237 (1990) (court may impose a fine payable to the\r\n aggrieved party as compensation for losses sustained); Annotation, Right of\r\n Injured Party to Award of Compensatory Damages or Fine in Contempt\r\n Proceeding, 85 A.L.R.3d 895 (1978); United States v. United Mine Workers\r\n of America, 330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947); Curlee v.\r\n Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d 915 (1982) (contempt was civil where\r\n appellant could purge himself of one year sentence by paying respondent's\r\n expenses she incurred in recovering the children from appellant).\r\n\r\n\r\np.54\r\n\r\nPOSTON v. POSTON \r\n\r\nCompare with State v. Magazine, supra (because contemnor could not\r\npurge himself of the contempt by merely complying with the court's order\r\nwhere contemnor was ordered to serve one year in prison or pay to the\r\ncourt a fine of $1500.00 the contempt was criminal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Civil contempt must be proven by clear and convincing\r\nevidence. United Mine Workers of America v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 114\r\nS.Ct. 2552, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994) (burden of proof in civil contempt\r\nproceeding is clear and convincing); In re General Motors Corp., supra\r\n(civil contempt must be proven by clear and convincing evidence); 17\r\nAm.Jur.2d Contempt Â§ 207; see also Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 306\r\nS.E.2d 624 (1983) (willfulness of the violation must be shown by clear and\r\nspecific acts or conduct); Curlee v. Howle, supra (before a person may be\r\nheld in contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to the acts or\r\nconduct upon which such finding is based).  In a criminal contempt\r\nproceeding, the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. State v.\r\nBowers, 270 S.C. 124, 241 S.E.2d 409 (1978); State v. Bevilacqua, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The United States Supreme Court has held a defendant\r\ncharged with a serious as opposed to a petty criminal contempt 's entitled\r\nto a jury trial. See Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct.\r\n2687, 41 L.Ed.2d 912 (1974) (a contemnor had no right to a jury trial\r\nwhere the sentence imposed is confinement for six months or less); Frank\r\nv. U.S., 395 U.S. 147, 89 S.Ct. 1503, 23 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969) (lengthy\r\nprobation was not serious enough to entitle conterrmor to a jury trial);\r\nMuniz v. Hoffman, 422 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 2178, 45 L.Ed.2d 319 (1975)\r\n(payment of a $10,000 fine was not serious).  But see Ex Parte Griffin,\r\n682 S.W.2d 261 (Tex. 1984) (a $104,000 fine and a sentence to jail for 30\r\ndays was a serious offense entitling the contemnor to a jury trial).  A civil\r\ncontempt proceeding does not require a jury trial. Shillitani v. U.S., 384\r\nU.S. 364, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966) (no jury trial is required\r\nfor a civil contempt proceeding even though the resulting imprisonment\r\nmay be long because the contemnor may avoid the sanction-by complying\r\nwith the court's order); see also 17 Am.Jur.2d Contempt Â§ 203.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In a civil contempt proceeding, a contemnor may be required to\r\nreimburse a complainant for the costs he incurred in enforcing the court's\r\nprior order, including reasonable attorney's fees.  The award of attorney's\r\nfees is not a punishment but an indemnification to the party who\r\ninstituted the contempt proceeding.  Thus, the court is not required to\r\nprovide the contemnor with an opportunity to purge himself of these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.55\r\n\r\nPOSTON v. POSTON \r\n\r\nattorney's fees in order to hold him in civil contempt.  See Whetstone v.\r\nWhetstone, 309 S.C. 227, 420 S.E.2d 877 (Ct.  App. 1992) (court properly\r\nawarded wife attorney's fees incurred as the result of husband's contempt);\r\n17 Am.Jur.2d Contempt Â§ 241 (it is within the trial court's discretion to\r\naward reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party in a civil contempt\r\nproceeding); A.S. Klien, Annotation, Allowance of Attorney's Fees in Civil\r\nContempt Proceedings, 43 A.L.R.3d 793 (1972); see also Curlee v. Howle,\r\nsupra; Golden v. Gallardo, 295 S.C. 393, 368 S.E.2d 684 (1988) (attorney's\r\nfees are recoverable in post-divorce litigation concerning visitation and\r\nsupport of parties' minor children).  A governmental body, as a\r\ncomplainant, may recover attorney's fees in a successful contempt\r\nproceeding, provided no statute prohibits recovery. Donovan v. Burlington\r\nNorthern Inc., 781 F.2d 680 (9th Cir. 1986) (an award of attomey's fees to\r\nthe governmental agency, the complainant, is within the court's discretion);\r\nMatter of St. Charles Mfg.  Co., 663 F. Supp. 310 (N.D. 111. 1987) (holding\r\nan award of attorney's fees to government was proper because such an\r\naward is within the inherent power of the court to remedy civil contempt);\r\nUnited States v. Greyhound Corp., 370 F. Supp. 881 (N.D. 111. 1974) (upon\r\na finding of civil and/or criminal contempt, a court may award to the\r\ncomplainant, as part of the civil relief, attorney's fees); 17 Am.Jur.2d\r\nContempt Â§ 243.  Although usually a complainant is not entitled to\r\nattorney's fees in a criminal contempt proceeding, depending on the\r\ncircumstances, such an award may be proper. 17 Am.Jur.2d Contempt Â§\r\n247.  After all, the award of attorney's fees is not part of the punishment;\r\ninstead, this award is made to indemnify the party for expenses incurred\r\nin seeking enforcement of the court's order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of civil contempt sanctions:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The contemnor is ordered to pay a fine to the\r\ncourt; however, he may purge himself of the fine by\r\ncomplying with the prior court order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The contenmor is given a jail sentence to be,\r\nserved until he agrees to comply with the prior\r\ncourt order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  The conteirmor is ordered to pay a\r\nfine/damages to complainant and is ordered to pay\r\na fine to the court; however, the contenmor may\r\npurge himself of the fine payable to the court by\r\n\r\n\r\np.56\r\n\r\nPOSTON v. POSTON \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplying with the prior court order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The contemnor is ordered to pay a\r\nfine/damages to complainant and is given a jail\r\nsentence to be served until he agrees to comply\r\nwith the prior court order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of criminal contempt sanctions:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The contemnor is ordered to pay a fine to the\r\ncourt.  Even if the contemnor performs the\r\naffirmative act required by the prior court order,\r\nthe fine must still be paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The contemnor is sentenced to jail for a definite\r\nperiod of time.  Even if the contemnor performs the\r\naffirmative act required by the prior court order,\r\nthe contemnor must still serve the entire jail\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  The contemnor is given a choice between\r\npaying a fine to the court or serving a definite\r\nperiod of time in jail.  The contemnor must do one\r\nor the other, thus he cannot purge himself entirely\r\nof the sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In our opinion, it is impossible to determine whether the\r\ncontempt sanction in this case is criminal or civil.1 The contempt order is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1The Court of Appeals based its finding that the contempt was\r\ncriminal in nature on the fact that respondent had to pay petitioner's\r\nattorney's fees regardless of whether she complied with the family court\r\norders prohibiting her from having contact with her children.  However, as\r\ndiscussed above, the award of the attorney's fees is not determinative.\r\nPetitioner was awarded attorney's fees for successfully bringing this\r\nmatter before the family court.  The family court had the discretion to\r\ndetermine whether to reimburse petitioner for the expenses he incurred in\r\npursuing this matter.  Thus, the court is not required to provide\r\nrespondent with an opportunity to purge herself of these attorney's fees in\r\norder to hold her in civil contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\np.57\r\n\r\nPOSTON v. POSTON \r\n\r\nnot clear; instead, it is a hybrid because the sanction has characteristics of\r\nboth civil and criminal contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n While the potential sentence of imprisonment is for a definite\r\nperiod, it will not be imposed unless and until respondent violates one of\r\nthe orders at issue.  This is a characteristic of civil contempt because\r\nrespondent can avoid the prison sentence by complying with the orders\r\nprohibiting her from having contact with her children.  Respondent can\r\npurge herself of the prison term by performing the affirmative act --\r\ncomplying with the family court's orders.  Moreover, other language in the\r\nfamily court order at issue indicates the purpose of the contempt sanction\r\nis to coerce respondent to comply with the orders prohibiting her from\r\nhaving contact with her children, not to punish her for violating the\r\nprevious court order.  If the purpose of the sanction was to punish\r\nrespondent for violating the order, the family court would have ordered\r\nrespondent to prison immediately instead of making the sentence\r\nconditional upon future violations of the orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On the other hand, if respondent violates the orders\r\nprohibiting her from having contact with her children, she will go to jail\r\nfor a fixed period of time with no ability to purge herself of the sentence.\r\nThis is a characteristic of criminal contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Further, the family court order can be read as imposing a\r\nsanction on respondent for future alleged violations of the orders without\r\nany determination by a tribunal that respondent willfully violated the\r\norder on that occasion.2By punishing respondent for future violations\r\n without first holding a hearing to determine if respondent willfully\r\nviolated the orders, the court could potentially violate respondent's due\r\nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\r\nConstitution and Article I, Â§ 3 of the South Carolina Constitution. See\r\nBloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968) (most\r\nprocedural requirements applicable to other criminal trials are applicable\r\nto a hearing on criminal contempt including notice and an opportunity to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2JudgeCuretondiscussedthis possibility in his concurring and\r\ndissenting opinion. Poston, supra.  However, Judge Cureton only\r\naddressed the new restriction added in the 1995 order.  He concluded the\r\norder can be read to prematurely sanction respondent for violating the\r\nnew restriction in the 1995 order in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\np.58\r\n\r\nPOSTON v. POSTON \r\n\r\nbe heard); Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. at 632, 108 S.Ct. at 1429-30, 99\r\nL.Ed.2d at 731-32 (\"criminal penalties may not be imposed on someone\r\nwho has not been afforded the protections the [United States] Constitution\r\nrequires of such proceedings\"); State v. Brown, 178 S.C. 294, 182 S.E. 838\r\n(1935), appeal dismissed by, 298 U.S. 639, 56 S.Ct. 750, 80 L.Ed. 137\r\n(1936) (due process requires a person shall have a reasonable opportunity\r\nto be heard before a legally appointed and qualified impartial tribunal\r\nbefore any binding order can be made affecting his rights to life, liberty, or\r\nproperty); 16A Am.Jur.2d Constitutional Law Â§ 812 (1979) (due process\r\nrequires notice and an opportunity to be heard).  Compare with Morrissey\r\nv. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (requiring a\r\nhearing be held prior to revoking probation because it must be determined\r\nif the violations warrant revocation); see also 59 Am.Jur.2d Pardon and\r\nParole Â§Â§ 101 &amp; 106 (1987).  Like probation revocation, respondent cannot\r\nbe punished for violating the orders in the future unless the willfulness of\r\nthe violation is shown by clear and specific acts or conduct.  Moseley v.\r\nMosier, supra.  If in the future respondent violates the family court orders,\r\na new contempt proceeding must be initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Therefore, we affirm that portion of the Court of Appeals'\r\nopinion remanding the case to the family court.  However, we reverse the\r\nCourt of Appeals' finding respondent was held in criminal contempt.  Upon\r\nremand, the family court should clarify its intent and issue an order\r\nsetting forth a contempt sanction that is either clearly criminal or clearly\r\ncivil in accordance with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n II.\r\n\r\n\r\n Petitioner claims because the contempt was civil in nature, the\r\nCourt of Appeals erred in vacating the award of attorney's fees to\r\npetitioner.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n As discussed in Section 1, the imposition of attorney's fees on\r\nrespondent was not intended as part of the sanction.  Instead, the family\r\ncourt imposed the attorney's fees on respondent because petitioner was\r\nsuccessful in bringing this action and petitioner should be reimbursed for\r\nthe expenses he incurred.  Thus, we reinstate the family court's award of\r\nattorney's fees to petitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED IN PART; REVERSED IN\r\nPART; AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\np.59\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24803","title":"State v.

Wilson, of Conway, for\r\nrespondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n MOORE, A.J.: Appellant was convicted of murdering a police\r\nofficer and sentenced to death.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\np.60\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HILL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On March 7, 1994, Officer Spencer Guerry of the Georgetown\r\nPolice Department stopped appellant in the parking lot of a car wash.\r\nAppellant was driving a silver/gray Honda Prelude with expired Colorado\r\nplates.  He did not have a valid driver's license and he, had marijuana in\r\nthe car.  Officer Guerry took appellant's Colorado identification card and\r\ncar registration and called the information in to the dispatcher.  As he\r\nwas walking back to appellant's car, he was shot once through the cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n After the shooting, appellant drove to his house, picked up his\r\n girlfriend, Wendy, and some of his belongings, and then drove to his\r\n mother's mobile home.  He told his mother he was in trouble and asked if\r\n Wendy could borrow her car.  His mother refused but offered to drive.  His\r\n mother and Wendy followed appellant down a dirt road where appellant\r\n drove his car into a ditch.  They then returned to his mother's mobile\r\n home and appellant asked Wendy to report his car stolen.  Wendy refused.\r\n Appellant left the mobile home for a while.  During his absence, the police\r\n arrived searching for appellant.  Later, appellant returned to his mother's\r\n mobile home.  He took a shower, washed his clothes, and poured Clorox on\r\n his hands.  He then called the police and was arrested.  Appellant's\r\n defense at trial was that someone had been hiding in his backseat and\r\n shot Officer Guerry.  At trial, several witnesses testified appellant was the\r\n only person in the Honda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcited Utterance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant contends the trial judge erred in refusing to allow a\r\nwitness to testify about hearsay evidence under the excited utterance or\r\nres gestae exception.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kenneth Grant was a block away from the car wash when the\r\nshooting occurred.  Fifteen minutes after the shooting, Grant went to the\r\ncar wash.  He testified in camera that after being at the car wash for\r\nanother 15 or 20 minutes, he heard an unidentifiable person in the crowd\r\nstate there were two suspects.  The trial judge ruled this hearsay\r\ntestimony inadmissible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Ru-le 803 (2), SCRE, states: \"The following are not excluded by\r\nthe hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness: ...\r\n(2) Excited utterance.  A statement relating to a startling event or\r\ncondition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement\r\n\r\n\r\np.61\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HILL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncaused by the event or condition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n The rationale behind the excited utterance exception is that\r\nthe startling event suspends the declarant's process of reflective thought,\r\nthus reducing the likelihood of fabrication.  See State v. Harrison, 298 S.C.\r\n333, 380 S.E.2d 818 (1989)(decided prior to the adoption of the Rules of\r\nEvidence but discussed the \"excited utterance\" exception in relation to res\r\n estae . In determining whether a statement falls within the excited\r\nutterance exception, the totality of the circumstances is viewed.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Statements which are not based on firsthand information, as\r\n where the declarant was not an actual witness to the event, are not\r\n admissible under the excited utterance or spontaneous declaration\r\n exception to the hearsay rule.\" 23 C.J.S. Crim.  Law Â§ 876 (1989).  The\r\n hearsay statement of an unknown bystander is admissible under the\r\n excited utterance exception only when the circumstances which surround it\r\n would affect the declarant in a way that assures its spontaneity and,\r\n therefore, its reliability for trustworthiness. People v. Mares, 705 P.2d\r\n 1013, 1016 (Colo. 1985).  See also People v. Fields,, 71 III.App.3d 888, 390\r\n N.E.2d 369 (1979)(if nature of event or circumstances indicate bystander\r\n did not observe the act, declaration should be excluded); State v.  Kent\r\n 157 Mich.App. 780, 404 N.W.2d 668 (1987)(declarant must have had.\r\n opportunity to personally observe the matter of which he speaks);\r\n Commonwealth v. Stetler, 494 Pa. 551, 431 A.2d 992 (1981)(declarant\r\n must have perceived the happening); Underwood v. State, 604 S.W.2d 875\r\n (Tenn.  Crim.  App. 1979)(excited utterance of bystanders admissible when\r\n declarant observed the act and the declaration arose from personal\r\n observation).  Cf Crawford v. Charleston-Isle of Palms Traction Co., 126\r\n S.C. 447, 120 S.E. 381 (1923)(under res gestae exception, declarant must\r\n have had opportunity to personally observe the matter of which he\r\n speaks).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n There is no evidence the unidentified declarant witnessed the\r\nshooting.  Further, it is unknown whether the declarant was under the\r\nstress of excitement caused by the event.  Therefore, the trial judge did\r\nnot err in ruling this statement inadmissible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresence of Uniformed Officers\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant contends the trial judge erred in refusing to clear\r\nthe courtroom and the hallways of uniformed officers.  Appellant also\r\nmoved for the trial judge to order officers who were witnesses to dress in\r\n\r\n\r\np.62\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HILL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncivilian clothing.1 Appellant contends this was a show of force which\r\ndenied him a fair trial.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n To prevail on such a claim, appellant must,show that the\r\nmeasures taken in the courtroom created either an actual or inherent\r\nprejudicial effect on the jury.  Inherent prejudice occurs when \"an\r\nunacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.\"\r\nHolbrook v. Flynn, 475 U.S. 560, 572, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 1346-47, 89 L.Ed.2d\r\n525, 535 (1986). State v. Tucker, _ S.C. _, 478 S.E.2d 260.9 271\r\n(1996)(citing Holbrook.  In Holbrook, the United States Supreme Court\r\nheld the presence of four uniformed officers seated directly behind the\r\ndefendant was not so inherently prejudicial that respondent was thereby\r\ndenied his constitutional right to a fair trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Here, appellant conceded that of the six people he counted,\r\nsome were bailiffs and personnel of the solicitor's office.  We cannot tell\r\nfrom the record how many uniformed officers were present.  We also\r\ncannot tell if these officers were witnesses waiting to testify.  There were\r\nat least 17 police officers (not counting SLED agents) who testified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In this case, the number of officers is unknown and the role of\r\nthe majority of the officers was not to provide additional security, but\r\nrather testify as witnesses.  Any actual prejudice in this case is wholly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The State argues appellant's argument is procedurally barred\r\nbecause he made this motion in limine and failed to renew the objection at\r\ntrial and obtain a final ruling citing State v. Schumpert, 435 S.E.2d 859,\r\n312 S.C. 502 (1993).  The State also argues this same procedural bar for\r\nappellant's issue regarding television cameras.  We disagree.  Appellant\r\nmade these motions during voir dire.  Generally, a motion in limine seeks\r\na pretrial evidentiary ruling to prevent the disclosure of potentially\r\nprejudicial matter to the jury.  See State v. Floyd, 295 S.C. 518, 369 S.E.2d\r\n842 (1988).  A pre-trial ruling on the admissibility of evidence is\r\npreliminary, and is subject to change based on developments at trial.  Id.\r\nHere, the issues appellant raised were not motions in limine. See\r\nHernandez v. State,  767 S.W.2d 902 (Tex.  Ct.  App. 1989)(appellant's\r\nmotion made during voir dire was not a true motion in limine).  The\r\nuniformed officers and television cameras were, according to appellant,\r\nalready affecting the jurors.  These were not motions in limine about the\r\nadmissibility of evidence which would not effect the trial until actually\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n\r\np.63\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HILL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeculative.  Appellant simply has presented no evidence to show the\r\npresence of the officers had any effect on the jury.  Further, without\r\nanything more than the mere assertion that six officers were present in\r\nthe courtroom, we cannot find appellant has shown any inherent prejudice.\r\nAccordingly, we find no actual or inherent prejudice.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Moreover, at the sentencing phase, appellant renewed his\r\nobjection and the trial judge went over specifically the number of officers\r\nin the courtroom.  The trial judge again denied the motion and appellant\r\nis not appealing this ruling.  Appellant stated there were four bailiffs, one\r\nuniformed officer near him, two uniformed officers near the door and two\r\nuniformed officers on the back row.  The appellant then stated if that was\r\nall of the officers in the courtroom, he was satisfied.  He was concerned\r\nthe courtroom might fill up with officers at a later time.  There were\r\nfewer officers present during the guilt phase which is the basis for this\r\nissue on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n As to requiring the officers who were witnesses to dress in\r\ncivilian clothing, we find this issue has no merit.  The trial court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in allowing the officers to testify while in uniform\r\nsince the officers were acting in their official capacity and not as civilians.\r\nPeople v. Beil, 76 III.App.3d 924, 395 N.E.2d 400 (1979).  See also Brown v.\r\nIndiana, 256 Ind. 444, 446, 269 N.E.2d 377, 378 (1971)(\"It would be\r\nnothing short of ludicrous for this Court to hold these officers would be\r\nrequired to change into civilian clothes before entering the court room to\r\ntestify.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelevision cameras\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant contends the trial judge erred in refusing to order\r\nthe television cameras to discontinue filming during jury selection.\r\nAppellant argues the television cameras were intimidating the jurors.  We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, appellant points to two jurors.  One juror originally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The appellant states the presence of the uniformed officers resulted\r\nin a \"carnival-like atmosphere.\" However, he does not point to any\r\nevidence or show how the officers' presence might have disrupted the trial\r\nor influenced the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\np.64\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HILL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad not given correct information about his mental status.  The juror sent\r\nthe trial judge a note stating he did not give correct information and he\r\nwanted to inform the court he was on medication for depression.  The trial\r\njudge cleared the courtroom and inquired as to the jurqr's mental status\r\nand his medication.  This juror stated, \"[T]here were people in the room\r\nthat I did not want to have this information . . . \" The juror never stated\r\nhe was troubled by only the media or, in particular, the cameras.  The\r\nother juror stated he thought the voir dire process was going to be more\r\nprivate and he did not realize the media and others would be present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant's argument addresses only the presence of television\r\ncameras in the courtroom, while these jurors' concerns were about privacy\r\nin general.  Further, we note both of these jurors were found unqualified\r\nby the trial judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Lastly, appellant contends camera crews from three television\r\nstations were present at trial and created a disruptive atmosphere.  This\r\ninformation is not in the record.  In fact, when appellant made this\r\nmotion, the court noted there was only one television crew present.  The\r\ntrial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to remove the cameras\r\nfrom the courtroom.  Accordingly, this issue has no merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVoir Dire Regarding Specific Mitigating Circumstance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant wanted to ask jurors whether they would consider\r\nthat appellant did not have a significant prior criminal history of violence.\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge erred in not allowing him to ask this\r\nquestion on voir dire.3 We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The authority and responsibility of the trial court is to focus\r\nthe scope of the voir dire examination as set forth in S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§14-7-1020 (Supp. 1995). State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619\r\n(1984).  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(D) (Supp. 1995) grants a capital\r\ndefendant the right to examine jurors through counsel but does not\r\nenlarge the scope of voir dire permitted under Â§ 14-7-1020. State v.\r\nOwens, 293 S.C. 161, 359 S.E.2d 275 (1987).  The manner in which these\r\nquestions are pursued and the scope of any additional voir dire are\r\nmatters of trial court discretion. State v. Smart, 278 S.C. 515, 299 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 We note the trial judge also ruled that he would not let the State\r\nidentify any specific aggravating circumstance during voir dire.\r\n\r\n\r\np.65\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HILL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n686 (1982).\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant cites Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 119 L.Ed.2d\r\n492, 112 S.Ct. 2222 (1992), for the proposition that general questions\r\nabout whether a juror would follow the law are not adequate in voir dire.\r\nIn Morgan, the United States Supreme Court held the defendant was\r\nentitled to know if jurors would consider general mitigating evidence.  The\r\nCourt did not hold that the defendant was entitled to know if a juror\r\nwould consider specific mitigating evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In United States v. Tipton, 90 F.3d 861 (4th Cir. 1996), the\r\ncourt held the trial court's refusal to allow questioning of jurors about\r\nspecific mitigating factors did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\r\nAppellant had wanted to ask jurors whether they would be willing to\r\nconsider mitigating factors such as appellant's \"deprived poor background,\"\r\n66 emotional,\" \"physical abuse,\" \"young age,\" \"limited intelligence,\" and \"brain\r\ndysfunction.\" The court stated that \"[t]he undoubted fact that such\r\ndetailed questioning might have been somehow helpful to appellant in\r\nexercising peremptory challenges does not suffice to show an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\" Id. at 880.  The court reasoned that the trial judge had\r\nsufficiently voir dired the jurors to cull out any prospective juror who\r\nwould always vote for the death penalty whatever the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 11 S.Ct. 1899, 1905, 114\r\nL.Ed.2d 493 (1991), the United States Supreme Court held a defendant is\r\nentitled to specific questions only if the failure to ask them would render\r\nhis trial \"fundamentally unfair.\" Here, the trial judge stated he would\r\nallow appellant to ask whether a juror would consider mitigating\r\ncircumstances as presented by the defense and as instructed by the court.\r\nThis general question covers whether a juror would refuse to consider\r\nmitigating circumstances and does not render appellant's trial unfair.\r\nAccordingly, this issue has no merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Victim Impact Evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant contends the trial court erred in allowing the\r\nadmission of victim impact evidence.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n At the time of appellant's trial, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1550\r\n(1985) provided that a victim may submit to the court at the time of\r\nsentencing a victim impact statement to be considered by the judge.\r\nSubsection (A) provided: \"The provisions of this section govern the\r\n\r\n\r\np.66\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HILL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisposition of any offense within the jurisdiction of the General Sessions\r\nCourt, excluding any crime for which a sentence of death is sought, in any\r\ncase which involves an identified victim whose whereabouts are known.\"\r\n(emphasis added).4 Appellant contends this language prohibited victim\r\nimpact evidence from being admitted at his trial.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n This section merely limits the victim impact evidence in non-\r\ncapital cases.  It does not address the admission of victim impact evidence\r\nin capital proceedings. By merely excluding capital proceedings, this\r\nsection does not prohibit any victim impact evidence from being admitted\r\nin capital sentencing proceedings.5 Section 16-3-1550 merely sets forth the\r\nprocedure for victim impact statements for other crimes.  There is no\r\nstatutory section which provides for the introduction of victim impact\r\nevidence in a death penalty case.  However, our case law clearly allows for\r\nits introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115\r\nL.Ed.2d 720 (1991), the United States Supreme Court reversed its prior\r\nprecedent regarding the admission of evidence of a victim's personal\r\ncharacteristics and the emotional impact of the murder on the victim's\r\nfamily in a capital sentencing hearing.  We adopted Payne in State v.\r\nJohnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991).  Accordingly, this issue has\r\nno merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant's remaining arguments are affirmed pursuant to\r\nRule 220 (b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Issue 1: State v.\r\nBabb, 299 S.C. 451, 385 S.E.2d 827 (1989)(denial of motion for continuance\r\nwill not be disturbed absent clear abuse of discretion resulting in\r\nprejudice); Issue 6: Washington v. Whitaker, _ S.C.       451 S.E.2d 894\r\n(1994)(admission of evidence is within sound discretion of trial court and\r\nits ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent clear abuse of discretion);\r\nIssue 8: State v. Simpson, __ S.C.__    , 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996)(Simmons V.\r\nSouth Carolina,     U.S.    , 114 S.Ct. 2187,     L.Ed.2d - (1994),\r\napplies only when defendant is ineligible for parole and future\r\ndangerousness is argued).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 This section was re-written by 1997 Act No. 141, Â§ 3, effective\r\nOctober 1, 1997.  This exclusionary language is not in the current statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 5 We also note subsection (F) states: \"No sentence may be invalidated\r\nbecause of failure to comply with the provisions of this section.\"\r\n\r\n\r\np.67\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HILL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We have conducted the proportionality review pursuant to S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985).  The sentence was not the result of passion,\r\nprejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; the evidence supports the finding\r\nof the aggravating circumstance; and the sentence is not disproportionate\r\nto that imposed in similar cases.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\nDeputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior\r\nAssistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter,\r\nIII, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Donald V. Myers,\r\nof Lexington, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n WALLER, A.J.: Powers was convicted of murder, first degree burglary,\r\nand assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK).  He was respectively\r\nsentenced to death, life imprisonment and twenty years.  We consolidate\r\nPowers' direct appeal with our mandatory review of his death sentence.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.69\r\n\r\nSTATE v. POWERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n In the early morning hours of September 8, 1960, Powers, then 16\r\nyears old, broke into the home of 68 year old Yeoman Senn (Victim) and his\r\nwife Linnie.  He went to their bedroom where he stabbed Victim 10 times in\r\nthe chest, shoulder and arm; one of the wounds slashed Victim's aorta; he\r\nbled to death.  Linnie Senn was beaten in the face and chest and suffered a\r\nbroken collar bone and 6 fractured ribs.  Powers stole several dollars in small\r\nchange from the Senn's home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n While in custody on larceny charges in January, 1991, Powers confessed\r\nto Yeoman Senn's murder.  The matter was transferred from juvenile court\r\nto general sessions court where, after a trial in February, 1996, Powers was\r\nsentenced to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Did the State's strike of Juror #28 violate Batson v.\r\nKentucky?1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Did the court err in requiring Powers, for purposes of jury\r\nselection, to reveal his witness list?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Does the State's delay in filing a notice of intent estop it from\r\nseeking a death sentence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Should the trial court have held an in camera hearing to\r\ndetermine the admissibility of victim impact testimony?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.   Did the court err, at sentencing, in admitting color\r\nphotographs of the victim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Did the court err, at sentencing, in admitting a videotape of\r\nthe crime scene?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Did the court err in refusing to permit defense counsel to\r\nspecifically voir dire the jury as to whether it would consider\r\nPowers' age as a mitigating circumstance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). \r\n\r\np.70\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. POWERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. JUROR # 28\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers contends the state's strike of Juror # 28 violated Batson v.\r\nKentucky, and Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120\r\nL.Ed.2d 33 (1992).  This issue is patently unpreserved for review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n After both sides had exercised peremptory challenges and a jury had\r\nbeen chosen, the trial court asked, \"[w]hat is the position of the defense in\r\nregard to a Batson hearing?  Do you request one or not?\" Counsel for Powers\r\nspecifically responded, \"[w]e do not make a Batson challenge.\" The trial court\r\nnonetheless required the solicitor to articulate the reasons for his peremptory\r\nchallenges.  After the solicitor had stated the basis for his strikes, the trial\r\ncourt asked if the defense \"wanted to put anything on the record in regard\r\nto solicitor's presentation.\" Defense counsel declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers' failure to raise any objection to the strike precludes review of\r\nthis issue on appeal. State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996);\r\nState v. Johnston, 489 S.E.2d 228 (Ct.App. 1997) (failure to object to\r\ndismissal of juror in violation of Batson and Georgia v. McCollum constitutes\r\nwaiver of those issues on appeal).  See also People v. Baker, 621 N.Y.S.2d\r\n615 (1995)(argument that prosecutor improperly exercised peremptory\r\nchallenges to exclude homosexual prospective jurors unpreserved).  Contrary\r\nto Powers' contention, the mere fact that jurors have an equal protection\r\nright to serve does not relieve him of the burden of preserving the issue for\r\nappeal. See State v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 472 S.E.2d 235 (1996); State v.\r\nByram, __ S.C.__, 485 S.E.2d 360, (1997) (failure to raise constitutional\r\nissues at trial results in waiver on appeal).  Accordingly, we decline to\r\naddress this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 2. WITNESS LIST\r\n\r\n\r\n The trial court ordered \"that the State and the defendant present to the\r\nCourt and identify to the Court all witnesses to be called at trial so that I\r\ncan qualify this jury with some decree of accuracy and pursuant to the law.\"\r\nPowers contends this ruling conflicts with our holdings in State v. Miller, 289\r\nS.C. 316, 345 S.E.2d 489 (1986) and State v. Hall, 268 S.C. 530, 235 S.E.2d\r\n112, 114 (1977).  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Miller, we held it is error to require, prior to trial, that the\r\n\r\n\r\np.71\r\n\r\nSTATE v. POWERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefendant supply the state with a list of his witnesses.2In Hall, 268 S.C.\r\n530, 235 S.E.2d 112, 114 (1977), we held a defendant is not required to\r\nannounce in advance the nature of his defense. Miller and Hall are\r\ninapposite.  Here, Powers was not required to reveal, as a matter of pretrial\r\ndiscovery, his witness list to the state, nor was he required to announce the\r\nnature of his defense.  He was merely required at the outset of trial to\r\ndisclose his witnesses to the court for purposes of jury selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n It is the duty of the trial judge to see that a jury of unbiased, fair and\r\nimpartial persons is impaneled. State v. Matthews, 291 S.C. 339, 353 S.E.2d\r\n444 (1986); State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990).  The\r\ndetermination of whether a juror is qualified to serve on a death penalty case\r\nis within the sole discretion of the trial judge and is not reversible on appeal\r\nunless wholly unsupported by the evidence. State v. Plemmons, 286 S.C. 78,\r\n332 S.E.2d 765 (1985), vacated on other grounds, 476 U.S. 1102, 106 S.Ct.\r\n1943, 90 L.Ed.2d 353 (1986); State v. Spann, 279 S.C. 399, 308 S.E.2d 518\r\n(1983).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Although we have not previously addressed this issue, other courts have\r\n mandated a defendant divulge his witness list prior to voir dire of the jury.\r\n See State ex rel Hill v. Reed, 483 S.E.2d 89 (W.Va. 1996) (lower court acted\r\n within its discretion in ordering state and petitioner to provide the court with\r\n a list of witnesses on the first day of trial prior to voir dire of jury); People\r\n v. Cangiano, 502 N.Y.S.2d 349 (1986) (disclosure of prospective witnesses is\r\n required to determine whether any prospective juror is related to or knows\r\n any one of them and may be challenged for cause3, and disclosure\r\n immediately prior to jury selection cannot prejudice defense absent\r\n extraordinary circumstances); State v. Ussery, 416 S.E.2d 610 (N.C. 1992)(no\r\n abuse of discretion in requirement that defendant divulge potential witnesses\r\n for voir dire purposes); People v. Perry, 569 N.E.2d 287 (111.  App. 1991); Com.\r\n v. Larsen, 682 A.2d 783 (Pa. 1996).  See also Mau v. North American\r\n Asbestos Corporation, 509 N.E.2d 112 (Ill.  App. 1987) (list of witnesses is not\r\n \"work product\" and statute limiting disclosure of witnesses applied only to\r\n pretrial discovery).  We find the trial court acted within its discretion in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Miller dealt with former Circuit Court rule 103, now Rule 5,\r\nSCRCrimP.  Rule 5 is inapplicable here; it deals with pre-trial discovery of\r\ndocuments in a criminal case; it does not address disclosure of witness lists\r\nduring voir dire for purposes of jury selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 3Notably, in the present case, the trial court struck one juror for cause\r\nafter the defense disclosed its witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\np.72\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. POWERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequiring disclosure of Powers' witness list during jury selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n 3. ESTOPPEL TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers next asserts the trial court erred in denyin4 his motion to estop\r\nthe state from seeking the death penalty where it failed to serve him with\r\na \"Notice of Intent To Seek The Death Penalty\" for more than three years\r\nafter his indictment.  We find no estoppel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers' failure to raise a speedy trial motion precludes review of this\r\nissue. State v. Burroughs, Op.  No. 2726, S.C. Ct.  App. filed Sept. 27, 1997\r\n(Davis Adv.  Sh.  No. 28).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In any event, the only notice requirement for the state to seek the\r\n death penalty is that the defendant be given 30 days notice prior to trial.\r\n S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-26(A) (Cum.Supp. 1996); State v. Young, 319 S.C. 33,\r\n 459 S.E.2d 84 (1995).  Powers claims, citing Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127,\r\n 112 S.Ct. 1810, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992), that the jury \"was entitled to see the\r\n true demeanor of the defendant at the time that the crime was committed.\"\r\n Riggins merely held that forced medication, during trial, denies a defendant\r\n due process unless it is essential to medicate the defendant to enable him to\r\n be tried. Riggins is inapplicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n As Powers was given the notice required by section 16-3-26, the trial\r\ncourt properly ruled the state was not estopped to seek the death penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 4. VICTIM IMPACT EVIDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers next contends the trial court erred in failing to hold an in\r\ncamera hearing on the admissibility of the state's victim impact evidence.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n This Court has never required an in camera hearing prior to admitting\r\nvictim impact evidence, and the cases implicitly recognize that such a hearing\r\nis not necessary. See State v. Byram, _ S.C. _, 485 S.E.2d 360, 365\r\n(1997).  On the contrary, we have held it is within the trial judge's discretion\r\nwhether to rule on the admissibility of evidence prior to its being offered in\r\nthe regular course of the trial. State v. Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 298 S.E.2d\r\n212 (1982).  We have also recognized that in all situations other than an\r\nassault on the voluntariness of a confession, the granting of a motion for a\r\nsuppression hearing is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial judge.\r\nState v. Patton, 322 S.C. 408, 472 S.E.2d 245 (S.C. 1996), citing United\r\n\r\n\r\np.73\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. POWERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStates v. Odom, 736 F.2d 104, 110 (4th Cir.1984). See also State v. Silver,\r\n307 S.C. 326, 414 S.E.2d 813 (Ct.App.1992), aff'd as modified, 314 S.C. 483,\r\n431 S.E.2d 250 (1993) (criminal defendant does not have an absolute right to\r\na pretrial, in camera hearing and ruling on an in limine motion to exclude\r\nbreathalyzer results in a DUI trial).  We hold it is within the trial court's\r\ndiscretion whether to hold an in camera prior to admitting victim impact\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Moreover, the victim impact evidence in this case was properly\r\n admitted.  The entirety of the evidence presented was the brief testimony of\r\n Senn's daughter, Deborah, and his wife, Linnie.  This testimony was well\r\n within the parameters of previous cases of this state, and was permissible to\r\n demonstrate Mr. Senn's uniqueness as a human being and the impact his\r\n death had on his family. See State v. Rocheville, 310 S.C. 20, 425 S.E.2d 32,\r\n cert. denied, 508 U.S. 978, 113 S.Ct. 2978, 125 L.Ed.2d 675 (1993) (victim\r\n impact evidence served purpose of showing the specific harm committed by\r\n the defendant and merely portrayed victims as unique individuals); Riddle v.\r\n State, 314 S.C. 1, 443 S.E.2d 557, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1003, 115 S.Ct. 518,\r\n 130 L.Ed.2d 424 (1994) (testimony of victim's stepdaughter regarding victim's\r\n standing in the community, victim's grandchildren, and the impact the crime\r\n personally had on stepdaughter was relevant to establish the victim as a\r\n unique human being and to show specific harm committed by defendant);\r\n State v. Ivey , _ S.C. _, 481 S.E.2d 125 (1997) (testimony of victim's\r\n mother that victim pled for his life and that his death was useless held\r\n permissible).  We find no error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 5. COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers next asserts 6 color photographs admitted at the sentencing\r\nphase of his trial were so gruesome and prejudicial as to require reversal.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The relevance, materiality and admissibility of photographs are matters\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court.  If the photographs serve to\r\ncorroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit them. State\r\nv, Tucker, supra; State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349, cert. denied,\r\n__U.S. __      , 116 S.Ct. 2566, 135 L.Ed.2d 1083 (1996). A photograph should\r\nbe excluded only if it is calculated to arouse the jury's sympathy or prejudice\r\nor is irrelevant or unnecessary to substantiate facts. State v. Todd ' 290 S.C.\r\n212, 349 S.E.2d 339 (1986).  Photographs of the victim's body are admissible\r\nin the sentencing phase of a capital trial to show the circumstances of the\r\ncrime and the character of the defendant. State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281,\r\n\r\n\r\np.74\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. POWERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n350 S.E.2d 180 (1986).  The trial judge must balance the prejudicial effect of\r\nthe photographs against their probative value.  However, the scope of the\r\nprobative value is much broader during the sentencing phase of a capital\r\ntrial. State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We have viewed the photos and, although they are not pleasant, they\r\ndepict the victim's body in substantially the same condition as Powers left it,\r\nand are relevant to demonstrate the circumstances of the crime.  The autopsy\r\nphotographs corroborate the pathologist's testimony describing the wounds\r\nVictim received.  Accordingly, we find the photos were properly admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers contends, citing State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357\r\n (1995), that photographs are admissible only to demonstrate an aggravating\r\n circumstance in the case.  We disagree.  Although Franklin held certain color\r\n photographs admissible because they served to demonstrate the aggravating\r\n circumstance of torture, Franklin does not stand for the proposition that such\r\n photographs may be admitted only to demonstrate an aggravating\r\n circumstance.  Such a holding would be contrary to the majority of this\r\n Court's opinions addressing the admissibility of color photos at the sentencing\r\n phase of a capital trial and finding them relevant and admissible so long as\r\n they demonstrate the circumstances of the crime and the character of the\r\n defendant, or they depict the victim's body in substantially the same\r\n condition in which the defendant left it. State v. Tucker, supra, State v.\r\n Williams, supra; State v. Komahrens; Riddle v. State 314 S.C. 1, 443 S.E.2d\r\n 557 (1994); State v. Gilbert, 277 S.C. 53, 283 S.E.2d 179 (1981).  See also\r\n State v. Shaw, 273 S.C. 194, 255 S.E.2d 799 (1979) (photographs depicting\r\n postmortem abuse to victim's body properly admitted, not as additional\r\n evidence in aggravation of punishment, but as evidence of the\r\n circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the individual\r\n defendant).  Accordingly, we find the photos were properly admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 6. VIDEOTAPE\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers next asserts error in the admission of a videotape, at\r\nsentencing, of the crime scene as police found it in the early morning hours\r\nof Sept. 8, 1990.  The videotape depicts Victim's body exactly as police found\r\nit, and is not unduly gruesome.  We find the videotape permitted the jury to\r\ngain a true perspective of the scene precisely as Powers left it.  Accordingly,\r\nit was properly admitted. Accord State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d\r\n368 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, unlike still photographs, the videotape allowed the jury to\r\n\r\n\r\np.75\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. POWERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n gain a dimensional viewpoint, accord Camargo v. State, 941 S.W.2d 404 (Ark.\r\n 1997); Flores v. State, 915 S.W.2d 651 (Tex.  App. 1996) (generally, videotapes\r\n give a more panoramic representation of the evidence than a still photograph\r\n and, thus, may be more helpful to the jury than a still photo), and sheds\r\n light on the violence done to the victim.  See Williams v. State, 874 S.W.2d\r\n 369 (Ark. 1994) (videotape and photographs showed the nature and extent of\r\n wounds which were relevant to showing the defendant's intent as could be\r\n inferred from the type of weapon used, the manner of use, and the nature,\r\n extent and location of wounds); Wellons v. State, 463 S.E.2d 868 (Ga. 1995)\r\n (videotape showing location of body and murder scene was probative of\r\n defendant's intent and mental state). See generally Allen, Admissibility of\r\n Visual Recording, 41 A.L.R.4th 877, Â§ 11(a) (1985).  Admission of the\r\n videotape was proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 7. VOIR DIRE RE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers contends, citing Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222\r\n (1992), that he should have been permitted to ask prospective jurors their\r\n opinion of various mitigating circumstances.     We recently rejected an\r\n identical contention in State v. David Claylon Hill, S.C. Sup.  Ct.  Op.  No. 24803\r\n (filed June 8,, 1998) (Davis Adv.  Sh.  No. 21 at 60) See also State v.\r\n Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997) (upholding trial court's\r\n limitation of voir dire regarding mitigating circumstances).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n As noted by our opinion in Hill, Morgan v. Illinois does not require the\r\nquestioning concerning specific mitigating factors.  Morgan merely recognized\r\nthat a capital defendant may challenge for cause any prospective juror who\r\nindicates he or she will automatically vote for death in every case.4Morgan\r\ndoes not, however, stand for the proposition that a defendant is entitled to\r\nopen-ended inquiry regarding a prospective juror's sentiments on each and\r\nevery possible aggravating and mitigating circumstance.  Other courts have\r\nspecifically rejected an identical contention.  See State of North Carolina v.\r\nSkipper, 446 S.E.2d 252, cert. denied 115 S.Ct. 953, 130 L.Ed.2d 895 (N.C.\r\n1994) (holding that Morgan does not require a defendant to be permitted to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4Recently, in State v. Bennett, we reversed a sentencing phase\r\nproceeding where a juror's response to voir dire indicated that if eleven other\r\njurors so voted, he would always go along with the majority and vote for a\r\nsentence of death.       Under these circumstances, we found he would\r\n\"automatically\" vote for death such that he was not qualified. State v.\r\nBennett, Op.  No. 24718, S.C. Sup.  Ct. filed Dec. 1, 1997 (Davis Adv.  Sh.  No.\r\n33).\r\n\r\n\r\np.76\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE v. POWERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvoir dire jurors regarding how they would be affected by evidence of mental\r\nimpairment, age, and other mitigating circumstances, since such questions\r\nwould \"stake out\" juror and pledge him to a future course of action; general\r\nquestions as to whether juror would consider mitigating circumstances as\r\ncharged by the judge are sufficient); State v. Wilson, 659 N.E.2d 292 (Ohio\r\n1996) (Morgan does not require individual voir dire on separate mitigating\r\nfactors); State v. Kreutzer, 928 S.W.2d 854 (Mo. 1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Here, Powers was permitted to question jurors if they would consider\r\naggravating and mitigating circumstances as charged by the trial court; and\r\nwas specifically permitted to ask if they would consider age as a mitigating\r\ncircumstance if so charged by the judge.  The trial court acted within its\r\ndiscretion in limiting the scope of voir dire in this case. State v. Patterson,\r\nsupra (manner and scope of additional voir dire are matters within trial\r\ncourt's discretion).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Powers remaining issues are affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR,\r\nand the following authorities: Powers' Issue 4 (Notice of Prior Bad Acts)--\r\nState v. Gaskins, 284 S.C. 105, 326 S.E.2d 132 (1985); State v. Plath, 277\r\nS.C. 126Y 284 S.E.2d 221 (1981); Powers' Issue 5 (Polygraph)-- State v.\r\nPressley, 290 S.C. 251, 349 S.E.2d 403 (1986); State v.

We have conducted the\r\nproportionality review required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(c) (1985).

Savitz, 111, of S.C.\r\nOffice of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for\r\nappellant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles Molony Condon, Deputy\r\nAttorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\nDeputy Attorney General Donald Zelenka, all of\r\nColumbia; and Solicitor Walter M. Bailey, of\r\nSummerville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNETT, A.J.: Appellant Thomas Treshawn Ivey was\r\nconvicted of the murder, kidnaping, and armed robbery of Robert\r\nMontgomery. He was sentenced to death for murder and thirty years\r\nimprisonment for armed robbery. This appeal consolidates appellant's\r\ndirect appeal with the mandatory review provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n16-3-25 (1985). We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\np.3\r\n\r\nState v. Ivey\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early January 1993, appellant and Vincent Neumon escaped\r\nfrom a prison in Alabama. Appellant and Neumon stole a truck and drove\r\nto Columbia, South Carolina, Neumon's hometown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeumon testified during the guilt phase of appellant's trial.\r\nAccording to Neumon's testimony, on the evening of January 13, 1993,\r\nappellant suggested the two men should rob some people. Appellant\r\ncarried a pistol in his coat pocket while the two men walked through\r\nColumbia. They stopped at Owens Steel. A maroon Suburban was parked\r\noutside. Mr. Montgomery came out of Owens Steel. At gunpoint,\r\nappellant led Montgomery back into the building to obtain the keys to the\r\nvehicle. When they returned, Neumon drove the vehicle, Mr. Montgomery\r\nsat beside him, and appellant sat in the back. Mr. Montgomery was\r\nscared and begged the two men not to hurt him; he stated he had a young\r\nchild at home and his wife was expecting another child. Neumon and\r\nappellant assured Mr. Montgomery he would not be hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeumon drove to North, South Carolina. At that point,\r\nappellant stated \"this is far enough.\" Neumon stopped the vehicle.\r\nAppellant told Mr. Montgomery to get out of the vehicle. Neumon\r\nremained in the vehicle. Appellant and Mr. Montgomery walked away.\r\nNeumon testified he saw the \"flame\" flash from the gun twice. Appellant\r\nreturned to the vehicle with the pistol in his hand. Appellant later told\r\nNeumon when he shot Mr. Montgomery in the back of the head his hair\r\n\"jumped up.\" He then rolled Mr. Montgomery over and'shot him in the\r\nchest. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeumon explained, prior to the murder, he (Neumon)\r\nborrowed the murder weapon from someone. On cross-examination,\r\ndefense counsel asked Neumon if he had borrowed the pistol from \"Fletch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1After failing to locate a \"chop-shop\" in Atlanta, Neumon and\r\n\r\nappellant disposed of Mr. Montgomery's vehicle in Winnsboro. They stole\r\nanother vehicle and drove to Sumter. In Sumter, appellant shot and killed\r\npolice officer Thomas Harrison. Appellant's conviction and death sentence\r\nfor the murder of Officer Harrison were affirmed by this Court in State v.\r\nIvey , 325 S.C. 137, 481 S.E.2d 125 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\np.4\r\n\r\nState v. Ivey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeumon stated he had.2\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a brief recess, the trial judge informed tAe parties he had\r\nreceived a note from Juror Young which stated: \"I know the person,\r\nFletch, that Mr. Neumon was talking about.\" Defense counsel and the\r\nsolicitor agreed the judge should examine Juror Young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter completion of Neumon's testimony, the trial judge asked\r\nJuror Young to remain in the courtroom and excused the remaining\r\nmembers of the jury. The trial judge examined Juror Young as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Okay, Ms. Young, you sent out a note that says, \"I know\r\nthe person, Fletch, that Mr. Neumon was talking about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Uh huh.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Do you feel like you know that same person?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. If it is the same person, would that have any effect (sic) on\r\nyour ability to be fair and impartial in this case, just because\r\nyou know Fletch?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. No, it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Ma'am.\r\nA. It shouldn't affect me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Okay. It shouldn't have any effect (sic) on you at all, you\r\njust wanted us to know that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Yeah.\r\nQ. Okay. All right, we appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\" Fletch\" was not identified as a potential witness during voir dire\r\n\r\nand did not testify at either stage of appellant's trial.\r\n\r\n\r\np.5\r\n\r\nState v. Ivey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solicitor stated no objection to Juror Young remaining on\r\nthe jury. Defense counsel requested Juror Young be removed. The trial\r\njudge denied the motion to remove Juror Young, observing she had stated\r\nher Icnowledge of \"Fletch\" would have no effect on her ability to remain\r\nfair and impartial. The trial judge then inquired if either party had\r\nitanything else.\" Defense counsel replied negatively. The court recessed\r\nfor the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following morning, after discussing other matters, defense\r\ncounsel moved to question Juror Young regarding her knowledge of\r\n\"Fletch.\" The trial judge denied the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nRelying on S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(D) and 14-7-1020 (Supp.\r\n1997), appellant now argues he was entitled to question Juror Young\r\nabout her relationship with \"Fletch.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant's request to ask additional questions of Juror Young\r\nwas untimely. If dissatisfied with the trial judge's examination of Juror\r\nYoung, appellant should have immediately moved for permission to make\r\nadditional inquiries of the juror. Appellant's request for additional\r\nquestioning the day after the trial judge had examined Juror Young and\r\nruled her qualified was untimely. State v. Nance, 25 S.C. 168 (1886)(if\r\ncounsel considered questioning by court perfunctory or otherwise\r\nunsatisfactory, the objection should have been made at the time of the\r\nquestioning); 50A C.J.S. Juries Â§ 489 (1997)(a party, by failing to object in\r\na timely fashion, waives any irregularity in the examination of jurors).\r\nAccordingly, this issue is not properly preserved for appeal. State v.\r\n Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991)(a contemporaneous objection\r\nis required to preserve an error for appellate review).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any event, neither Â§ 16-3-20(D) nor Â§ 14-7-1020 entitled\r\nappellant to question Juror Young. Section 14-7-1020 sets forth the\r\nparameters of inquiry for prospective jurors by the trial judge. Section 16-\r\n3-20(D) grants a capital defendant the right to examine jurors through\r\ncounsel but does not enlarge the scope of voir dire permitted under Â§ 14-7-\r\n1020. State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997), cert. denied,\r\n__U.S.__, 118 S.Ct. 146, 139 L.Ed.2d 92. These two statutes govern the\r\nselection of prospective jurors, not the situation where, as here, the court\r\nis informed of a matter which may justify the discharge of a seated juror.\r\n\r\n\r\np.7\r\n\r\nState v. Ivey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge properly inquired into the effect Juror Young's\r\nknowledge of \"Fletch\" would have on her ability to be fair and impartial.3\r\nJuror Young unequivocally stated her knowledge of \"Fletch\" would have no\r\neffect on her ability to render an impartial verdict. The trial judge did not\r\nabuse his discretion in allowing Juror Young to remain on the jury. State\r\nv.

(Dissenting): I respectfully dissent. I would affirm appellant's convictions,\r\nbut I would reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased upon the non-definitive nature of Juror Young's response to the court that her ability\r\nto be fair and impartial \"should not\" be affected by the fact that she knew Fletch, and the cursoriness\r\nof the trial judge's examination, I would hold that the trial judge erred in failing to allow further\r\nexamination of Juror Young. (Emphasis added.) During the following portion of his guilt phase\r\ncross-examination Vincent Neumon, appellant's accomplice, admitted that he (Neumon) had\r\nborrowed the murder weapon from an individual named Fletch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.

You told Fletch y'all were going to rob some drug dealers, and isn't\r\nit true that since you're from Columbia, you know where the drug dealers live, you know\r\nthose areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. True.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the jury was sent out and another issue was discussed out of the jury's\r\npresence. Prior to bringing the jury back into the courtroom, the trial judge advised counsel that he had received from one\r\n  of the jurors a note which stated: \"I know the person, Fletch, that Mr.\r\nNeumon was talking about.\" With counsel's assent, the Judge ruled that the juror would be\r\nquestioned at the conclusion of Mr. Neumon's examination, and testimony resumed in the presence of the jury. At the end\r\n of the state's case, except for the author of the note, the jurors were excused for the evening recess. Juror Young was then\r\n examined by the Court as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Okay, Ms. Young, you sent out a note that says, \"I know the person, Fletch, that Mr. Neumon was talking about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Uh huh.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Do you feel like you know that same person?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. If it is the same person, would that have any effect on your ability to be fair and impartial in this case, just because you\r\n know Fletch?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. No, it shouldn't,\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Ma'am.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. It shouldn't affect me.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Okay. It shouldn't leave any effect on you at all, you just wanted us to know that?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Okay. All right, we appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State did not object to allowing Juror Young to continue on the case. Defense counsel\r\nobjected as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\np.1 0\r\n\r\nSTATE v. IVEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CULLER: Your Honor, we would argue that, you know, certainly if she has said\r\nthat she knows the same Fletch, this guy is someone from whom the gun was rented,\r\nthe drugs would be provided later, it was a Three fifty-seven Magnum, that causes\r\nus some problems and we would ask that she be removed.\r\nThe Court denied the defense motion to remove Ms. Young from the jury. When the trial\r\nresumed the next moming Mr. Early, one of the defense attorneys, made the following request to\r\nquestion Juror Young:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. EARLY: You recall, Ms. Young was a juror that we had moved to strike for cause\r\nin Winnsboro. She initially started out as a, a always death juror, and then she\r\nequivocated and came around, according the --Your Honor ruled that she came\r\naround to a Number Three juror. We just feel like that Fletch, who was the guy that\r\nprovided the gun to Neumon, being involved in the drug world, the gun world, and\r\nall the other situations, he's such an important character in this event, that I'd like to\r\nknow more about her knowledge of Fletch and question her on her ability to be\r\nunbiased and firm in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court denied appellant's motion to question Juror Young, holding that Fletch was\r\nneither a witness nor a party and that he was not a major player in the case. Appellant contends it\r\nwas reversible error for the court to deny his motion to allow further questioning of Juror Young\r\nand, consequently, his death sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing. I agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the impartiality of the juror is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge.\r\nState v. Johnson, 248 SC 153, 149 S.E.2d 348 (1966). Johnson Involved the qualification of\r\nmembers of the jury venire before being seated as jurors and dealt with the trial judge's discretion in qualifying a jury based\r\n upon general information available at the beginning of that trial. Likewise, S.C. Code Â§Â§ 16-')-20(D) and 14-7-1020 (1976)\r\n (Supp. 1997) address voir dire examination of venirepersons. Conversely, the question before this court relates to a\r\n particular juror's knowledge of an individual who was not the subject of voir dire examination, but who was introduced\r\n through testimony elicited during the trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn denying appellant's request for further questioning of Juror Young, the trial judge stated\r\nthat Fletch \". . . is, if anything, a very peripheral character, but certainly, not even a witness.\" On\r\nthe contrary, mention of the name Fletch occurs several times in the record in conjunction with\r\ncrucial evidence. Cross examination connected Fletch with illegal activities which had the potential to be known by people\r\n who knew Fletch, including Juror Young. Testimony suggested that Fletch was involved in drug dealing. Fletch was\r\n reportedly the person who provided the gun used in the commission of the crime for which the appellant was charged.\r\nUpon hearing the testimony concerning Fletch. Juror Young obviously felt compelled to apprise the trial court of the fact\r\n that she knew Fletch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEssentially, the trial judge's examination consisted of restating the text of Ms. Young's note,\r\nand no further information about the juror's knowledge of or relationship with Fletch was elicited\r\nby the court. I hold the view that after Juror Young's repeated response that knowing Fletch\r\n\r\n\r\np.11\r\n\r\nSTATE v. IVEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"should not\" affect her ability to be fair and impartial, further examination was required to ascertain the context in which\r\n the juror was acquainted with Fletch. Recognizing that qualification of jurors on voir dire is within the discretion of the\r\n judge, a review of the voir dire examination of Juror Young tends to support Appellant's concern over Juror Young's\r\n ability to accord fair and impartial consideration to this capital case. In her reply to a series of voir dire questions on her\r\n view of imposing capital punishment, the record reflects that Juror Young equivocated on whether she could vote for a\r\n penalty of less than death for a defendant found guilty of killing someone. The defense had sought unsuccessfully to strike\r\n Juror Young for cause on the basis of her responses on voir dire examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority cites State v. Nance, 25 S.C. 168 (1886), to support its holding that the\r\nappellant waived his right to further examination of the juror by failing to make a timely objection. I note that, according to\r\n the record, the issue of Juror Young's disclosure that she knew Fletch was the last business taken up by the court at the end\r\n of the court day and among the first items considered when the trial resumed the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs set forth in the majority opinion, whether and in what form to conduct an inquiry may\r\ndepend upon the circumstances. 50A C.J.S. Juries Â§ 503 (1997). The trial of a capital case and the imposition of the\r\n resulting punishment are inherently different from any other criminal prosecution. At the very least, justice demands and\r\n conscience dictates that the irretrievable extinguishment of human life by the state be preceded by a conscionable effort to\r\n be thorough, fair and reasonably certain that adequate measures are ... observed to minimize the likelihood of an illegal\r\n execution. State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991)(Finney, A.J., dissenting). Clearly, the circumstances\r\n attending Juror Young's revelation warranted a more thorough inquiry than was conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would hold that the record before this court supports appellant's entitlement to a new\r\nsentencing proceeding due to the failure of the trial court to ascertain, through appropriate\r\nexamination, the extent of Juror Young's knowledge of Fletch and whether or not there existed such knowledge of or\r\n connection with Fletch as would affect her ability to render a fair and impartial verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cumulative effective of Juror Young's inclination to impose the penalty of death, and\r\nthe absence from this record of responses by the Juror which would enable the court to ascertain the extent of her\r\n knowledge of Fletch, an individual whose name was raised in connection with parties whose roles were significant in this\r\n case raises, in my mind, serious questions as to Juror Young's ability to accord the appellant a fair and impartial trial. I\r\n would reverse appellant's death sentence and remand for a new sentencing proceeding\r\n\r\n\r\np.12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24808","title":"Taylor v.

(CIBL) appeals the trial court's order awarding respondent\r\nGayle H. Taylor (Mrs. Taylor) attorney's fees and costs under the South\r\nCarolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (the UTPA).1 S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-\r\n140(a) (1985).  We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) violate equal protection\r\nbecause it allows recovery of attorney's fees for successful\r\nplaintiffs but not for successful defendants? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in awarding $500,000\r\nin attorney's fees and $24,068 in costs? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n I. \r\n  \r\n CIBL argues Â§ 39-5-140 violates the United States and South\r\nCarolina Constitutions' equal protection provisions2 because it provides for\r\nrecovery of attorney's fees to prevailing plaintiffs but not to prevailing\r\ndefendants.  CIBL relies on Southeastern Home Building &amp; Refurbishing v.\r\nPlatt, 283 S.C. 602, 325 S.E.2d 328 (1985). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Both the United States and South Carolina Constitutions forbid\r\ndenial by the State of the equal protection of the laws.  A court will\r\ndeclare a statute unconstitutional if its repugnance to the Constitution is\r\nclear beyond a reasonable doubt.  \"When the constitutionality of a statute\r\nawarding attorney's fees is questioned as a violation of equal protection, a\r\ncourt must determine whether the legislative classification is rationally\r\nrelated to the object of the statute.\" Id., S.C. at 603, S.E.2d at 329. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Southeastern Home Building, id., the Court held an award\r\nof attorney's fees to prevailing plaintiffs but not prevailing defendants \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-10 to -160 (1985). \r\n\r\n2 U.S. Const. amend.  XIV; S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§ 3.\r\np.11\r\n\r\nTAYLOR v. MEDENICA\r\nunder the mechanics' lien statute violated equal protection.  The Court\r\ndetermined giving priority to claims regarding work performed and\r\nmaterials furnished did not justify the classification.  The Court noted,\r\n\"[i]ndeed, authorizing fee awards to prevailing defendants, as well as\r\nplaintiffs, would not chill the laborer's right to seek relief in court.\" Id.\r\nS.C. at 604, S.E.2d at 329. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On other occasions, however, the Court has upheld the\r\nstatutory allowance of attorney's fees to prevailing plaintiffs but not to\r\nprevailing defendants. See Bradley v. Hullander 277 S.C. 327, 287 S.E.2d\r\n140 (1982)(securities fraud cases); Coker v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 265 S.C.\r\n260, 217 S.E.2d 784 (1975)(bad faith denial of insurance claims); see also\r\nMissouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railroad Co. of Texas v. Cade, 233 U.S. 642, 34\r\nS.Ct. 678, 58 L.Ed.2d 1135 (1914)(statute designed to promote prompt\r\npayment of small claims providing recovery of attorney's fees to plaintiffs\r\nbut not defendants did not violate 14th Amendment).  In Bradley v.\r\nHullander, supra, S.C. at 330, S.E.2d at 141, the Court noted \"[r]equiring\r\nthe unsuccessful defendant to pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees is a\r\nlegitimate tool in enforcing the underlying public policy of the statute.\" \r\n  \r\n In relevant part, Section 39-5-140(a) provides: \r\n  \r\nUpon the finding by the Court of the violation of [the UTPA],\r\nthe Court shall award to the person bringing such action under\r\nthis section reasonable attorney's fees and costs. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The purpose of the UTPA is to discourage unfair methods of\r\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts in the conduct of any trade or\r\ncommerce. Â§ 39-5-20.  To be actionable under the UTPA, the unfair or\r\ndeceptive act or practice must have an impact upon the public interest.\r\nYork v. Conway Ford, Inc., 325 S.C. 170, 480 S.E.2d 726 (1997); Daisy\r\nOutdoor Advertising Co., Inc. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 473 S.E.2d 47 (1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The attorney's fee provision of Â§ 39-5-140 is rationally related\r\nto the policy objectives of the UTPA.  Allowing plaintiffs who successfully\r\npursue an action under the UTPA to recover their attorney's fees\r\nencourages individuals to pursue litigation to protect the public interest.\r\nSimilarly, requiring unsuccessful defendants to pay the plaintiff's attorney's\r\nfee discourages tradesmen from engaging in unfair methods of competition\r\nand unfair or deceptive acts in the conduct of trade or commerce, thereby\r\nalso enforcing the purpose of the UTPA.  We find the attorney's fee\r\nprovision of the UTPA is a legitimate tool which supports the policy \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nTAYLOR v. MEDENICA\r\nobjectives of the statute.  Consequently, the attorney's fee provision does\r\nnot violate equal protection. \r\n  \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n CIBL argues the lower court's award of $500,000 in attorny's\r\nfees and $24,068 in costs is excessive and not supported by the affidavits of\r\nMrs. Taylor's attorneys.  Specifically, CIBL contends the attorny's fee\r\naward is substantially more than Mrs. Taylor's trebled damages of\r\n$108,726.  Additionally, CIBL claims the affidavits are insufficient because\r\n1) they include estimates of time spent, 2) include tim spent before the\r\nfiling of the second amended complaint, and 3) fail to apportion time spent\r\nbetween claims against CIBL and claims against defendant Dr. Rajko D.\r\nMedenica.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In determining a reasonable attorney's fee, the court should\r\nconsider the following six factors: 1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of\r\nthe case; 2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; 3) the professional\r\nstanding of counsel; 4) the contingency of compensation; 5) the beneficial\r\nresults obtained; and 6) the customary legal fees for similar services.\r\nJackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997); Blumberg v. Nealco\r\nInc, 310 S.C. 492, 427 S.E.2d 659 (1993).  Consideration should be given to\r\nall six factors; none of the factors is controlling. Baron Data Systems, Inc.\r\nv. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 (1989).  On appeal, an award for\r\nattorney's fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient evidence in the record\r\nsupports each factor. Jackson v. Speed, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The trial court considered each of the above factors in setting\r\nthe attorney's fee award.  The trial judge based his award on the affidavits\r\nsubmitted by Mrs. Taylor's three attorneys and the affidavit of an attorney\r\nwho did not participate in this matter but attested the hourly rates and \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 Briefly, Mrs. Taylor brought this action against Dr. Medenica and\r\nCIBL alleging negligence and violation of the UTPA.  The jury returned a\r\nverdict in Mrs. Taylor's favor.  The trial court required Mrs. Taylor to elect\r\nbetween recovery under negligence and the UTPA.  Mrs. Taylor, CIBL, and\r\nDr. Medenica appealed.  This Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and\r\nremanded the matter to the trial court to consider Mrs. Taylor's\r\napplication for attorney's fees and costs from the date on which she filed\r\nher second amended complaint alleging a violation of the UTPA. Taylor v.\r\nMedenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996). \r\n  \r\np.13\r\n\r\nTAYLOR v. MEDENICA\r\nhours submitted were appropriate.4 The trial judge noted he had presided\r\nover a number of the discovery motions in this case, all of the pretrial\r\nmotions, and the two and one-half week trial.  The court determined the\r\namount of time estimated by Mrs. Taylor's attorneys, approximately 1500\r\nhours, was appropriate, if not conservative.  The court recognized all of\r\nMrs. Taylor's attorneys were experienced and capable trial attorneys and\r\nagreed the hourly rates for each were appropriate.  The court noted the\r\nattorneys had accepted this case on a contingency fee basis and opined it\r\nthought UTPA actions were one of the most difficult types of cases to try.\r\nThe trial court recognized the beneficial results obtained by the attorneys,\r\nboth in terms of the $108,726 recovered under the UTPA by Mrs. Taylor\r\nfrom CIBL and in terms of the public benefit in deterring CIBL from\r\nsimilar conduct. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In addition, the trial court took judicial notice that CIBL\r\nvigorously contested Mrs. Taylor's claims it had violated the UTPA, thereby\r\nrequiring Mrs. Taylor to present witnesses in response.  Mrs. Taylor's\r\nexperts testified CIBL's laboratory tests were excessive, \"absolutely\r\nbizarre,\" and the results were questionable.  One expert testified he\r\nbelieved the tests were conducted for the purpose of generating income.\r\nOne witness testified there was no medical reason for any of the tests,\r\n Another witness testified the tests were paid to Mrs. Taylor yet\r\nmedically worthless. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We have reviewed the affidavits submitted by counsel and\r\nagree they are somewhat deficient.  One affidavit includes approximately\r\n78 hours of time for work performed prior to the filing of Mrs. Taylor's\r\nsecond amended complaint. See footnote 3. Moreover, the affidavits do\r\nnot specifically state the time spent on the UTPA claim against CIBL. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In spite of these deficiencies, we conclude there is evidence\r\nwhich supports the approximately 1500 hours of time spent by Mrs.\r\nTaylor's attorneys on this matter.  The affidavits note the time spent by\r\nother attorneys and some legal professionals was not submitted for\r\nreimbursement.5 The judge who presided over the majority of this matter \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 The trial court did not award attorney's fees for work performed by\r\nattorney Thomas C. Taylor since he was also a party to the action. \r\n  \r\n 5 One attorney noted, at times, three or four lawyers in his firm\r\nperformed work on Mrs. Taylor's case, however, he did not include their \r\n  \r\np.14 \r\n  \r\n\r\nTAYLOR v. MEDENICA \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstated the submitted time was, in his view, conservative.  Furthermore,\r\ntime spent is but one factor to consider in setting a reasonable attorney's\r\nfee. Baron Data Systems, Inc. v. Loter, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n With regard to the issue of estimates, two of the three\r\naffidavits state the attorneys did not keep records of the time spent on this\r\ncase.6 Nonetheless, the accompanying time sheets do list specific services\r\nrendered and the time spent performing each service.  We conclude the\r\naffidavits and accompanying time sheets fairly reflect the time spent by the\r\nattorneys on this matter. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Finally, there is no requirement that an attorney's fee be less\r\nthan or comparable to a party's monetary judgment.  This Court has\r\napproved an award of attorney's fees where the fee substantially exceeded\r\nthe actual recovery. Baron Data Systems, Inc. v. Loter, id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We conclude the trial judge properly considered all six factors\r\nin determining the appropriate attorney's fee and find his decision\r\nawarding $500,000 in attorney's fees and $24,068 in costs7 is supported by\r\nthe record. Jackson v. Speed, supra.8 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Associate Justice\r\nJasper M. Cureton, concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\ntime in his submission.  Another attorney averred two paralegals expended\r\nseveral hundred hours each on this matter, but he did not submit a record\r\nof their time. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 6 We assume the attorneys meant they did not keep contemporaneous\r\ntime records. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 7 CIBL offers no argument in support of its claim the costs awarded\r\nwere inappropriate.  Accordingly, we decline to address this issue. First\r\nSavings Bank v.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\nDeputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of\r\nColumbia; and Solicitor Holman C. Gossett, Jr., of\r\nSpartanburg, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n BURNETT, A.J.: Appellant Theodore Kelly was convicted of\r\nmurdering his estranged wife, Imogene Kelly (Mrs.  Kelly), and her\r\ndaughter's fiancee, Keith Epps.  Appellant was also convicted of assault and\r\nbattery with intent to kill for his attack on Mrs. Kelly's daughter, Tracy \r\n  \r\np.3\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith.  Appellant was sentenced to death for the murders1 and twenty\r\nyears for assault and battery with intent to kill. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\n This incident arose out of a domestic dispute between appellant\r\nand Mrs. Kelly.  Mrs. Kelly's daughter, Tracy, testified her mother had\r\nobtained a restraining order against appellant in March of 1994.  She\r\nfurther stated Mrs. Kelly contacted the police on June 7, 1994, at\r\napproximately 5:30 p.m. because appellant had come to her residence.\r\nHowever, when the police arrived, they refused to enforce the order\r\nbecause they determined appellant had been living in the residence after\r\nthe March restraining order was issued.  Therefore, the police informed\r\nMrs. Kelly her restraining order was invalid and she would have to obtain\r\na new order.  The police did escort appellant off the premises.  After\r\nanother discussion later that same evening between the police, Mrs. Kelly\r\nand appellant, Mrs. Kelly agreed to place appellant's clothes in a plastic\r\ngarbage bag and leave it for him on the front porch. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Tracy testified she saw appellant outside the house around\r\n 10:00 p.m. that night; however, she did not call the police because she\r\n thought he was there to get his clothes.  Mrs. Kelly, Tracy's five-year-old\r\n son, and Mrs. Kelly's three-year-old adopted daughter went to bed around\r\n 10:00 p.m. They all slept in the same bed.  Tracy and Keith were in\r\n Tracy's bedroom.  Around 11:00 p.m., Keith went out to his car.\r\n Immediately after Keith left the house, Tracy heard a gunshot and then\r\n appellant ran into Tracy's bedroom.  She attempted to hide in her closet;\r\n however, appellant attacked her and shot her twice.  Appellant then ran\r\n out of Tracy's room and into her mother's room.  Tracy heard her mother\r\n say \"no Theodore\" and she heard two gunshots.  During this time Tracy\r\n attempted to leave the room; however, appellant returned to her room and\r\n she, again, ran to the closet.  As appellant attempted to pull Tracy out of\r\n the closet, he shot at her again but missed.  Appellant then returned to\r\n Mrs. Kelly's room and Tracy heard the sound of a physical assault.  Tracy\r\n again attempted to leave the room; however, appellant returned and began\r\n striking her on the head with the gun.  Appellant then went into the\r\n kitchen, returned with a knife, and stabbed Tracy several times.\r\n Appellant went toward the front of the house and Tracy was able to \r\n  \r\n\r\n1The jury found the following statutory aggravating circumstance:\r\ntwo or more persons were murdered by the defendant by one act or\r\npursuant to one scheme.

KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nescape and run to a neighbor's house for help. \r\n  \r\n Tracy's son, who was in the bedroom with Mrs. Kelly, testified\r\nthe sound of a gunshot woke him and he saw appellant shoot and beat\r\nMrs. Kelly.  Tracy's son testified appellant told him to go back to sleep\r\nand he did. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Keith's body was found outside the home with a .25 caliber\r\ngunshot wound to the head.  Mrs. Kelly's body, severely beaten and with\r\ntwo .25 caliber gunshot wounds, was found in her bedroom.  Tracy\r\nsuffered two gunshot and several stab wounds.  Fortunately, she survived\r\nthe attack.  Remarkably, the two children, who were sleeping in Mrs.\r\nKelly's bedroom, were unharmed.  The gun was never found.  The clothes\r\nMrs. Kelly had left on the porch for appellant were gone. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellant testified after his dispute with Mrs. Kelly he went to\r\nplay softball.  Because he was upset, he decided not to play and rode with\r\nsome men to a liquor store where he purchased and consumed a pint of\r\nliquor.  Appellant then testified he went with the men to a crack house\r\nnear Mrs. Kelly's residence, where he ingested some cocaine.  Appellant\r\npurchased a .25 caliber automatic pistol from patrons of the crack house\r\nand walked to Mrs. Kelly's residence to pick up his clothes.  When he\r\narrived, Keith opened the front door and began threatening appellant.\r\nKeith and appellant fought.  During the fight, Tracy and Mrs. Kelly came\r\nto the door and Mrs. Kelly threw Keith a gun and told Keith to shoot\r\nappellant.  When Keith reached for the gun, appellant shot him with the\r\n.25 caliber pistol.  Appellant testified he did not remember anything after\r\nthat point until he was back at the crack house.  A pistol clip from a .380\r\ncaliber pistol or a nine millimeter pistol was found outside Mrs. Kelly's\r\nresidence.  This clip could not be used in a .25 caliber pistol. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n ISSUES \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in refusing to grant\r\nappellant's motion for a mistrial based on juror misconduct? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. Did the trial judge err in denying appellant's motion for a\r\nnew trial based on information obtained about one of the jurors\r\nafter the conclusion of the trial? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII.  Did the trial judge err in finding appellant competent to\r\nstand trial prior to the presentation of the defense case in the \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KEL.LY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npenalty phase of the trial? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n I. \r\n  \r\n Appellant argues the trial judge erred in refusing to grant his\r\nmotion for a mistrial based on juror misconduct.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n After all the testimony had been presented, but prior to closing\r\narguments in the penalty phase of the trial, the trial judge received a note\r\nfrom Juror S.2 The note indicated a religious pamphlet concerning God's\r\nview on capital punishment was being circulated in the jury room.  Upon\r\nreceiving the note, the trial judge questioned the jurors individually to\r\ndetermine who, if anyone, had read the pamphlet and what information\r\nwas contained in the pamphlet. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n First, the trial judge questioned Juror S, who claimed she had\r\nonly seen the outside cover of the pamphlet.  According to Juror S, Juror\r\nO had brought the pamphlet into the jury room and Juror O had shared\r\nthe pamphlet with Juror H and Juror A. Juror S also stated other\r\nmembers of the jury were reading their Bibles on an individual basis.  The\r\ntrial judge voir dired the jurors named by Juror S as to whether they had\r\nreceived or been exposed to a pamphlet.  None of the jurors admitted to\r\nbeing exposed to any material outside of the courtroom.  All the jurors\r\nconfirmed they could render a fair and impartial verdict based solely on\r\nthe evidence presented in the courtroom. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Because the trial judge was concerned the jurors did not\r\nunderstand his questions, he inquired again and specifically asked the\r\njurors if they had read a pamphlet expressing God's view on capital\r\npunishment.  Four jurors admitted to either seeing and/or reading the\r\npamphlet.  However, three of these jurors claimed they could not recall\r\nany of the contents of the pamphlet or whether it expressed a view on\r\ncapital punishment.  Further, these jurors stated the pamphlet had not\r\nbeen offered to them until that morning.  These three jurors indicated\r\ntheir exposure to this pamphlet would not interfere with their ability to\r\nrender a fair and impartial verdict.  The fourth juror, Juror O, admitted\r\nthe pamphlet belonged to her and that her prayer partner at church had\r\ngiven her this pamphlet prior to sequestration.  Juror O showed the \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 The names of the jurors are not relevant to this discussion. \r\n\r\np.6\r\n\r\nSTATE v.  KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npamphlet to the trial judge and stated the pamphlet contained Biblical\r\nreferences on capital punishment.3 Juror O further admitted she offered\r\nthis pamphlet to other jurors; however, she was unsure if any of the other\r\njurors had actually read the pamphlet.  Two other members of the jury\r\nindicated they were reading their Bibles on their own. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellant's counsel made a motion for a mistrial based on this\r\npamphlet arguing the jurors had been less than truthful when initially\r\nquestioned under oath, at least four jurors had been tainted by the\r\npamphlet and, because Juror O possessed this pamphlet prior to the\r\ncommencement of the trial, both phases of the trial were affected.4 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The trial judge denied appellant's mistrial motion; however, he\r\ndid dismiss Juror O. The trial judge specifically found the pamphlet did\r\nnot influence the verdict rendered in the guilt phase because the pamphlet\r\nconcerned capital punishment.  The trial judge further concluded no other\r\njuror had been exposed to the contents of this pamphlet and the remaining\r\njurors indicated they could render a fair and impartial verdict based on\r\nhis instructions.  Therefore, the trial judge found the remaining jury\r\nmembers were not biased by the pamphlet. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \r\n  \r\n\r\n3The pamphlet, \"God, Law, and Capital Punishment,\" expresses a\r\npro-death penalty view and references Bible passages to support its view. \r\n  \r\n 4Appellant did not argue to the trial judge that the jurors were\r\n engaging in premature deliberations.  Therefore, this issue is not\r\n preserved for appellate review. State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d\r\n 360 (1997) (an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge\r\n in order to be preserved for appellate review).  Further, in his brief,\r\n appellant relies on the Bible reading by certain jurors as a ground for a\r\n mistrial.  Although this issue was raised in the new trial motion, it was\r\n not raised as a ground for a mistrial.  Thus, appellant cannot properly\r\n raise this type of trial error for the first time in his new trial motion.\r\n State v. Holmes, 320 S.C. 259, 464 S.E.2d 334 (1995). cert. denied, ____\r\n U.S. ____, 116 S.Ct. 2507, 135 L.Ed.2d 197 (1996) (evidentiary error cannot\r\n be raised for first time in a new trial motion).  Further, possession by\r\n jurors of personal Bibles consulted for personal guidance in the jury room\r\n prior to deliberations is not per se jury misconduct. See Jones v. Kemp,\r\n 706 F. Supp. 1534 (N.D. Ga. 1989) (misconduct occurs when the Bible was\r\n allowed in the jury room for use by a deliberating jury). \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution guarantee a defendant a fair trial by a panel of impartial and\r\nindifferent jurors. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48\r\nL.Ed.2d 126 (1976); Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d\r\n751 (1961); see also S.C. Const. art 1, Â§Â§ 3 &amp; 14.  To safeguard these\r\nrights, \"it is required that the jury render its verdict free from outside\r\ninfluences of whatever kind and nature.\" State v. Cameron, 311 S.C. 204,\r\n207, 428 S.E.2d 10, 12 (Ct.  App. 1993). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In a criminal prosecution, the conduct of the jurors should be\r\nfree from all extraneous or improper influences.  Unless the misconduct\r\naffects the jury's impartiality, it is not such misconduct as will affect the\r\nverdict.  The trial court has broad discretion in assessing allegations of\r\njuror misconduct.  Relevant factors to be considered in determining\r\nwhether outside influences have affected the jury are the number of jurors\r\nexposed, the weight of the evidence properly before the jury, and the\r\nlikelihood that curative measures were effective in reducing the prejudice.\r\nGenerally, the determination of whether extraneous material received by a\r\njuror during the course of the trial is prejudicial is a matter for\r\ndetermination by the trial court. 23A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 1365 (1989). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The granting or refusing of a motion for a mistrial lies within\r\n the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed\r\n on appeal unless an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law\r\n occurs. State v. Wasson, 299 S.C. 508, 386 S.E.2d 255 (1989).  A mistrial\r\n should not be granted unless absolutely necessary.  Instead, the trial judge\r\n should exhaust other methods to cure possible prejudice before aborting a\r\n trial. Id. In order to receive a mistrial, the defendant must show error\r\n and resulting prejudice. Id. The trial judge is in the best position to\r\n determine the credibility of the jurors; therefore, this Court should grant\r\n him broad deference on this issue. State v. Johnson, 248 S.C. 153, 149\r\n S.E.2d 348 (1966) (the question of the impartiality of the juror is\r\n addressed to the discretion of the trial judge); State v. Loftis, 232 S.C. 35,\r\n 100 S.E.2d 671 (1957) (refusing to interfere with the discretion of a trial\r\n judge in matters involving the jury because the trial judge has the\r\n opportunity to consider the credibility of the jurors). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n While it was improper for Juror O to possess this pamphlet, in\r\nour opinion, appellant failed to show prejudice.  Initially, we find it\r\nillogical to assume Juror O was influenced in the guilt phase of the trial\r\nbecause of this pamphlet.  At most, this pamphlet may influence a juror to\r\nsentence a convicted defendant to death for his crime.  Therefore, the trial\r\njudge correctly concluded this pamphlet did not affect the verdict rendered \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nSTATE v.  KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby the jury in the guilt phase of this trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Moreover, the trial judge is in the best position to determine\r\nthe credibility of the jurors and he found them credibly and capable of\r\nrendering an impartial verdict based solely on the evidence. See State v.\r\nJohnson, supra.  The trial judge conducted extensive voir dire of the jurors\r\nboth prior to empaneling the jury and during questioning concerning this\r\nincident.  The trial judge questioned jurors extensively about potential\r\nbiases and prejudices and, thus, placed himself in the best position to\r\nassess the truthfulness of the jurors.  Further, the trial judge consistently\r\nadmonished the jury not to discuss the case and not to consider\r\nextraneous material.  The trial judge did not find members of the jury\r\nwere being untruthful.  We respect this finding. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Further, the misconduct occurred prior to deliberations and the\r\n trial judge immediately removed the tainted juror. See United States v.\r\n Hill, 688 F.2d 18 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1074, 103 S.Ct. 498, 74\r\n L.Ed.2d 638 (1982) (both jurors exposed to extraneous materials were\r\n dismissed from the jury prior to deliberations and the materials were\r\n immediately removed from the jury room; therefore, defendant suffered no\r\n prejudice); State v. Rodgers, 435 P.2d 864 (Ariz.  Ct.  App. 1967), vacated on\r\n other grounds, 442 P.2d 840 (Ariz. 1968) (affirming trial court where\r\n although the juror committed misconduct by reading a book on criminal\r\n instructions during a recess, the trial court carefully went into the effect of\r\n the extracurricular reading and concluded there was no prejudice); Jordan\r\n v. State, 429 S.E.2d 97 (Ga.  Ct.  App. 1993) (affirming trial court where\r\n trial court questioned juror who had brought material into the jury room\r\n and found no harm); Earley v. State, 595 So.2d 430 (Miss. 1992) (finding\r\n no abuse of discretion where the only juror who read the entire newspaper\r\n article was promptly dismissed and the other jurors who had only read\r\n portions of the article which were not prejudicial were retained); Lane v.\r\n State, 881 P.2d 1358 (Nev. 1994), cert. dismissed, 514 U.S. 1058, 115 S.Ct.\r\n 1444, 131 L.Ed.2d 323 (1995) (no abuse of discretion in denying\r\n defendant's motion for a mistrial where the juror who brought the book\r\n into the jury room was removed and all other jurors indicated upon\r\n questioning that they had not been influenced by the dismissed juror and\r\n would follow the law as instructed); State v. Bonney, 405 S.E.2d 145 (N.C.\r\n 1991) (upholding the trial court's denial of defendant's mistrial motion\r\n where trial court conducted a thorough inquiry and court removed juror\r\n who had brought a book entitled \"The Complete Jack the Ripper\" into the\r\n jury room during the trial and had watched the news coverage of this trial\r\n on television); State v. Searles, 621 A.2d 1281 (Vt. 1993) (trial court has \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscretion in evaluating the impact of a news account upon the jury and,\r\nwhere some jurors had knowledge of the news account but no juror\r\nresponded that the knowledge would influence the juror's judgment, there\r\nwas no showing of an abuse of discretion). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n There is no evidence suggesting any juror except Juror O had\r\naccess to the pamphlet prior to the morning of closing arguments in the\r\nsentencing phase of the trial.  Therefore, the deliberations of the\r\nremaining jurors were not tainted by the pamphlet and, in our opinion,\r\nthe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying appellant's motion\r\nfor a mistrial.  Instead, the trial judge took appropriate action by\r\nremoving the tainted juror from the jury and replacing her with an\r\nalternate juror to ensure appellant received a fair and impartial verdict. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n II. \r\n  \r\n Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his new\r\ntrial motion based on information obtained about Juror P after the trial\r\nconcluded.  Specifically, appellant claims Juror P's failure to disclose his\r\nparticipation in a death penalty rally in 1986 during voir dire prevented\r\nappellant from making an intelligent decision in exercising his peremptory\r\nstrikes.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Juror P was never specifically asked during voir dire about his\r\nparticipation in a death penalty rally.  The defense did question Juror P\r\nabout his \"position\" on the death penalty.  Juror P's response to this\r\nquestion was it would depend on the situation.  Juror P admitted he had\r\nthought about the death penalty in the past.  During voir dire, Juror P\r\nindicated he could be fair and impartial and depending on the\r\ncircumstances he could return either a life sentence or death sentence.\r\nJuror P indicated once again he could be impartial when questioned about\r\nthe pamphlet incident. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n After the jury returned its sentence in this case, a local\r\nnewspaper article quoted Juror P as saying \"l think the only thing I regret\r\nis that [appellant] has only one life to give for the two he took.\" In the\r\narticle, Juror P revealed in 1986 while a student at Winthrop College, he\r\nled a group of 40 students on a trip to Columbia to attend the execution of\r\nTerry Roach.  An article in the Winthrop paper indicated Juror P was\r\nsupporting the execution of Roach; however, he was not advocating\r\nexecution in all cases.  Further, the rally was organized as an educational\r\nprogram in an effort to raise social awareness. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellant's new trial motion was premised on Juror P's\r\nmisleading and incomplete answers on voir dire.  Appellant maintained\r\nthat had he been aware of Juror P's activities, he would have exercised a\r\npreemptory strike to exclude Juror P from the jury.  After careful review\r\nof Juror P's voir dire and the newspaper articles, the trial judge denied\r\nthe new trial motion finding nothing Juror P did in 1986 had any bearing\r\non his voir dire in this case.  The trial judge found Juror P qualified as a\r\npotential juror and his activities in 1986 did not disqualify him.  He\r\nrefused to allow appellant to question Juror P. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellant does not claim Juror P was disqualified as a\r\npotential juror as a matter of law.  Instead, the question is whether Juror\r\nP intentionally concealed information during voir dire, thus denying\r\nappellant the opportunity to make an informed decision concerning the\r\nseating of this prospective juror. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n A trial court's denial of a new trial motion will not be\r\ndisturbed on review absent a showing of an abuse of discretion which\r\nresults in prejudice to the defendant. State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 377\r\nS.E.2d 298 (1989); State v. Savage, 306 S.C. 5, 409 S.E.2d 809 (Ct.  App.\r\n1991). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The United States and South Carolina Constitutions guarantee\r\na criminal defendant the right to an impartial jury.  U.S. Const. amend.\r\nVI; S.C. Const., art. 1, Â§ 14.  To protect both parties' right to an impartial\r\njury, the trial judge must ask potential jurors, inter alia, whether they\r\nhave formed an opinion about a case or are aware of any bias or prejudice\r\nagainst a party. State v. Cason, 317 S.C. 430, 454 S.E.2d 888 (1995); S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 14-7-1020 (Supp. 1997).  This Court has recognized trial\r\njudges and attorneys cannot fulfill their duty to screen out biased jurors\r\nwithout accurate information. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNecessarily it is expected and required that jurors in\r\ntheir answers shall be completely truthful and that they\r\nshall disclose, upon a general question, any matters\r\nwhich might tend to disqualify them from sitting on the\r\ncase for any reason.  It therefore becomes imperative\r\nthat the answers be truthful and complete.  False or\r\nmisleading answers may result in the seating of a juror\r\nwho might have been discharged by the Court, challenged\r\nfor cause by counsel or stricken through the exercise of\r\nperemptory challenge. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.11\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Gulledge, 277 S.C. 368, 371, 287 S.E.2d 488, 490 (1982) (quoting\r\nPhotostat Corp. v. Ball, 338 F.2d 783 (10th Cir. 1964)); see also 47\r\nAm.Jur.2d Jury Â§Â§ 195, 208-09 (1995). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \"[A new trial] is required only when the court finds the\r\n[intentionally] concealed information would have supported a challenge for\r\ncause or would have been a material factor in the use of the party's\r\nperemptory challenges.  The inquiry must focus on the character of the\r\nconcealed information, not on the mere fact that a concealment occurred.\"\r\nThompson v. O'Rourke, 288 S.C. 13, 15, 339 S.E.2d 505, 508 (1986).\r\nUsing the juror disqualification analysis developed by this Court, our first\r\nquestion is whether Juror P intentionally concealed information in not\r\nrevealing his past activities during voir dire. Gray v. Bryant, 298 S.C.\r\n2851, 379 S.E.2d 894 (1989). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Here, we find no abuse of discretion because Juror P did not\r\nintentionally conceal information during voir dire. Gray v. Bryant, supra\r\n(finding intentional concealment where juror failed to disclose relationship\r\nwhen asked specifically about existence of relationship); State v. Savage,\r\nsupra (finding failure to disclose relationship was not intentional).\r\nAppellant failed to show Juror P's responses during voir dire were\r\nuntruthful or deceitful.  When questioned about his \"position\" on the death\r\npenalty, Juror P admitted he had \"thought about it in the past.\" However,\r\nhe indicated his \"position\" would depend on the circumstances of each\r\ncase.  Juror P was not specifically asked if he had participated in death\r\npenalty activities in the past.  In our opinion, a question concerning Juror\r\nP's \"position\" on the death penalty would not elicit the information\r\nappellant claims was intentionally concealed.  Further, Juror P's activities\r\nin 1986 only indicate he supported the execution of Roach, not that he\r\nsupported execution in all cases.  This is consistent with his testimony\r\ngiven during voir dire indicating that, depending on the circumstances, he\r\ncould impose a life sentence or a death sentence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellant contends the trial judge should have granted a\r\ncontinuance in the penalty phase of the trial when Dr. Lillian Tidler, a\r\ncourt qualified forensic psychiatrist, concluded appellant could not\r\ncompetently make a rational decision to take the stand and testify. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellant was diagnosed as suffering from Bipolar Type-II\r\nDisorder (depression with hypermanic features); a history of alcohol abuse; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nborderline intellectual functioning; and a partial complex seizure disorder.\r\nHe also has paranoid tendencies and periodically experiences\r\nhallucinations.  During the competency hearing on August 7, 1995, Dr.\r\nTidler testified appellant was competent to stand trial; however, she\r\ninformed the trial court that the stress of this trial could cause appellant\r\nto hallucinate resulting in impairment of his rational understanding of\r\nthese proceedings.  While the trial judge found appellant competent to\r\nstand trial, he ordered Dr. Tidler to be available to perform competency\r\nexams during the trial in case appellant's condition deteriorated. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Prior to presentation of the defense case in the penalty phase,\r\nDr. Tidler testified that upon her most recent examination, she found\r\nappellant competent even though he was experiencing some auditory\r\nhallucinations.  Dr. Tidler opined: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt is my opinion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\r\nthat overall [appellant] possesses a rational and factual\r\nunderstanding of the courtroom trial process and overall\r\npossesses the ability to assist [lead counsel] and his other\r\nattorney in his defense; however, in terms of taking the stand\r\nand making a rational decision, in that area I find he is not,\r\nbut overall I find he meets the statutory requirements overall.\r\n. . .  He's competent in assisting [trial counsel], however, he\r\ndisregards their legal advice based on his irrational thinking. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDr. Tidler testified, guided in part by auditory hallucinations from his\r\ndead sister, appellant hoped that by asking the jury for death he would\r\nreceive a life sentence.  Dr. Tidler stated the decision to testify and ask for\r\nthe death penalty was not a rational decision or consistent with\r\nappellant's wish to live.  On cross-examination, Dr. Tidler testified\r\nappellant possessed a rational and factual understanding of the courtroom\r\nproceedings.  Further, upon inquiry by the trial judge, Dr. Tidler stated\r\nappellant understood the roles of the judge, solicitor, defense counsel and\r\njury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The trial judge then questioned appellant.  Appellant indicated\r\nhe no longer wished to testify; however, he did want to address the jury\r\nduring closing arguments.  The trial judge then found appellant was still\r\ncompetent to stand trial.  Appellant's counsel did not object to this ruling,\r\nnor did they seek other relief.  During closing arguments, appellant did\r\naddress the jury and ask for death in a fairly incoherent statement; \r\n  \r\np.13\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhowever, he did not testify.5 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On appeal, appellant contends the trial judge should have\r\ncontinued the penalty phase until appellant was competent to consult\r\nrationally with his attorneys regarding whether to make a statement to\r\nthe jury.  This claim is unpreserved for review having neither been raised\r\nto nor ruled upon below. State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760,\r\ncert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 118 S.Ct. 146 (1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The test for competency to stand trial or continue trial is\r\n whether the defendant has the sufficient present ability to consult with his\r\n lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he\r\n has a rational, as well as a factual, understanding of the proceedings\r\n against him. Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\r\n 103 (1975); Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d\r\n 824 (1960); State v.

The purpose of requiring a defendant to be competent\r\n is \"to ensure that he has the capacity to understand the proceedings and\r\n to assist counsel.\" Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 402, 113 S.Ct. 2680,\r\n 2688, 125 L.Ed.2d 321, 329 (1993); see also Bell v. Evatt, 72 F.3d 421 (4th\r\n Cir. 1995), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 2533, 135 L.Ed.2d 1056\r\n (1996) (finding the trial judge only had to ensure the defendant had the\r\n capacity to understand, the capacity to assist, and the capacity to\r\n communicate with his counsel, not that the defendant was acting in\r\n accordance with his capacity).  A defendant must be competent throughout\r\n the trial, not just at its commencement. Drope v. Missouri, supra.  The\r\n defendant bears the burden of proving his incompetence by a\r\n preponderance of the evidence. State v. Nance, supra.  The trial court's\r\n determination of competency will be upheld if it has evidentiary support\r\n and is not against the preponderance of the evidence.  Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n5Defense counsel informed the trial court prior to closing arguments\r\nin the penalty phase that they had advised appellant not to address the\r\njury.  However, the mere fact that appellant chose to disregard his\r\nlawyer's advice does not make him incompetent to stand trial. See State\r\nv. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 360 S.E.2d 706 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1020,\r\n108 S.Ct. 734, 98 L.Ed.2d 682 (1988); Adams v.

KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We uphold the trial court's determination that appellant was\r\ncompetent.  In reaching his conclusion, the trial judge considered Dr.\r\nTidler's testimony, his own observations and appellant's testimony. See\r\n22A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 554 (1989) (trial judge is sole judge of the\r\ncredibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, and he\r\nalso is entitled to evaluate the conflicting testimony).  Dr. Tidler found\r\nappellant possessed a rational and factual understanding of the\r\nproceedings.  Further, contrary to Dr. Tidler's assertion that appellant was\r\nirrationally disregarding his counsels' advice not to testify, appellant\r\nindicated he was following his counsels' advice and did not want to testify.\r\nThus, appellant was capable of consulting with and assisting his defense\r\nlawyers.  Because there is evidentiary support for the conclusion reached\r\nby the trial court, and a finding of competency based on the record is not\r\nagainst the preponderance of the evidence, we affirm on this issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW \r\n  \r\n After reviewing the entire record, we conclude the death\r\nsentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\r\nfactor, and the jury's finding of the statutory aggravating circumstance of\r\ntwo or more persons were murdered by the defendant by one act or\r\npursuant to one scheme is supported by the evidence. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 16-3-25 (1985).  Further, we hold the death penalty is neither excessive\r\nnor disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases.

(Dissenting): I respectfully dissent.  I would\r\nreverse and remand.  In my view, the inappropriate possession and\r\nuse of the extraneous pamphlet by jury members so tainted the jury\r\nthat its contents affected the ability of the jury to be fair and\r\nimpartial at both the guilt and penalty phases of appellant's\r\nbifurcated trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n After a recess at the close of the presentation of penalty\r\nphase evidence, the trial judge held a conference in chambers with\r\ncounsel and the appellant.  The judge advised that he had received\r\nfrom a juror a note which stated that a pamphlet was being passed\r\naround in the jury room concerning God's word on the death penalty.\r\nJuror S was brought into chambers and the following is a portion of\r\nher examination by the judge. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTHE COURT: Can you tell me a little bit about what that\r\n pamphlet says?\r\nTHE JUROR: I haven't had it in my hands, so I don't know,\r\n but I saw the outside cover of it.  It says -- it's like\r\n God's word on criminal punishment; and I know they have\r\n that; and one of the girls brought her Bible this\r\n morning.  She has been like quoting passages and having\r\n everybody read out of the Bible.  Well, not everybody,\r\n but like two people and having them read some stuff.  I\r\n mean, I'm one of the most Christian people you can ever\r\n meet, but I don't think this is the time or the place.\r\nTHE COURT:   All right. Have you seen this pamphlet?\r\nTHE JUROR:   I've seen the outside of it. I have not looked\r\n inside of it.\r\nTHE COURT:   Do you know if any other jurors have seen it?\r\nTHE JUROR:   Yes, they have.\r\nTHE COURT:   Can you tell me how many?\r\nTHE JUROR:   I can't think how many, but I can say probably at\r\n least four -- at least.\r\nBY THE COURT: Do you know which ones?\r\nTHE JUROR: [Juror O] has it.  I saw her put it in her purse.\r\n. . .\r\nBY THE COURT: Is she the one that brought it?\r\nTHE JUROR: Yes, I'm almost positive she is the one that\r\n brought it.  I mean, it is in her purse right now.  I saw\r\n her put it in there.  There's her; there's I think four\r\n of them have seen it.   I'm pretty sure [Juror H] has.\r\n I'm not positive on [Juror H], but I'm pretty sure she\r\n has.\r\nTHE COURT: That's [Juror H]. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.16\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KEL.LY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUROR: Yes.  And also I think [Juror A] has seen it --\r\n [Juror A].  I didn't realize until, you know, the last\r\n person was looking at and they had been talking about it,\r\n but I did not know what it was until I saw the outside\r\n cover of it.\r\n. . .\r\nTHE COURT: All right.  And in so far as the reading of\r\n the scriptures, is that something that they have done\r\n individually? \r\n  \r\nTHE JUROR: Yes.  I mean, I just heard yell out, you know,\r\n read Deuteronomy, like 4:16, or something like that, and\r\n that's a good one to read, this one, and that one will\r\n make you think, or something like that. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At the conclusion of her examination, Juror S was sent to a\r\nseparate jury room, and each of the other jurors was examined out\r\nof the presence of the other jurors.  The trial judge asked whether\r\nthey had personally seen, read, been confronted by or exposed to\r\nany materials or literature other than the testimony and evidence\r\npresented in the courtroom or any discussions concerning the case\r\nbesides jury deliberations at the conclusion of the guilt phase. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Ten of the jurors, including Jurors A, H, O, and the\r\nalternate, responded in the negative.      Juror P qualified his\r\nresponse by saying that he had not seen anything \"concerning this\r\ncase or trial.\"    Juror S was recalled to give a more detailed\r\ndescription of the pamphlet.  The remaining eleven jurors and the\r\nalternate were then brought in separately and questioned\r\nspecifically about the pamphlet.  Eight, including Juror P, denied\r\nthat a pamphlet or any other literature was passed around or\r\ndiscussed in the jury room.   In the pertinent portions of their\r\nexamination, the remaining four responded as follows. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFrom the examination of Juror OR: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTHE COURT:  . . . Have you since this trial began read a\r\n pamphlet entitled God's Word on Criminal Punishment?\r\nTHE JUROR: Yes, sir.\r\nTHE COURT: You have? Could you tell me what it says?\r\nTHE JUROR: I couldn't really remember what it said. I\r\n just was reading through it while we was waiting.\r\nTHE COURT: When was that?\r\nTHE JUROR: This morning. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.17 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v.  KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Juror W stated that she had seen a pamphlet, but had neither\r\nseen the name on it nor held it.  She recalled one juror saying to\r\nanother \"here, read, you know, you might want to read this,\" or\r\nsomething . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n From the examination of Juror H: \r\n  \r\nTHE COURT: Since the jury has been placed together and\r\n sequestered, have you read a pamphlet entitled God's word\r\n on Criminal Punishment?\r\nTHE JUROR: I've seen it floating around.  I haven't actually\r\n read it myself.\r\nTHE COURT: You haven't read it.\r\nTHE JUROR: I have looked at it.\r\nTHE COURT: I beg your pardon?\r\nTHE JUROR: I have looked at it, but I haven't actually\r\n read it as far as reading it, \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Juror O admitted obtaining the pamphlet prior to sequestration\r\nfrom her \"prayer partner,\" and stated that she had been reading it\r\nfor reassurance that she was making the proper decision. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellant moved for a mistrial, asserting that the jurors had\r\nbeen less than truthful when first questioned, that at least four\r\njurors had been tainted by the pamphlet, and that because Juror O\r\nhad obtained the pamphlet prior to the commencement of trial, she\r\nharbored a bias toward guilt and capital punishment.1a The trial\r\njudge removed Juror O from the jury, but denied the motion for a\r\nmistrial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On appeal, appellant argues that the trial judge erred in\r\nallowing the trial to proceed with a jury whose deliberations had\r\nbeen tainted by the introduction of extraneous material.  I agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n I concur in so much of the majority's opinion as alludes to\r\nthe criteria for a fair and impartial jury as set out in the Sixth \r\n  \r\n\r\n1aWe note that in his argument to the trial judge, counsel\r\n for appellant did not explicitly assert that the evidence showed\r\n that at least some of the jurors were engaging in premature\r\n deliberations.  We view such misconduct as very serious;\r\n especially where, as here, the jury has been warned against it.\r\n See, e.g., Gallman v. State, 307 S.C. 273, 414 S.E.2d 780\r\n (1992). \r\n  \r\np.18\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution;\r\nEstelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126\r\n1976; Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751\r\n(1961); and S.C. Const. art I, Â§Â§ 3,14. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n However, removing Juror O from the jury was inadequate to cure\r\nthe prejudicial effect of the pamphlet.  The record reflects that\r\nat least four jurors had involvement with the pamphlet.  Excluding\r\nJuror O, two of the four admitted either looking at or reading\r\nthrough the pamphlet in the jury room.     \"It is fundamental that\r\nevery litigant who is entitled to trial by jury is entitled to an\r\nimpartial jury, free to the furtherest extent practicable from\r\nextraneous influences that may subvert the fact-finding process.\"\r\nHaley v. Blue Ridge Transfer Co., 802 F.2d 1532, 1534 (1986); State\r\nv. Cameron, 311 S.C. 204, 207, 428 S.E.2d 10, 12 (Ct.  App. 1993). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Where the misconduct involves the jurors' exposure to outside\r\ninfluences, the \"cases are strongest in which the juror has lent\r\nhimself to such influence as signified a willingness to receive\r\nadvice or favors.\" State v. Rowell, 75 S.C. 494, 511, 56 S.E.\r\n23,29 (1906).    Contrary to the majority's view, I find in this\r\nrecord ample evidence that the jury had access and exposure to the\r\npamphlet throughout the morning.      When the judge examined the\r\njurors the second time, at least one juror besides Juror O admitted\r\nto \"reading through the pamphlet while we were waiting,\" on the\r\nmorning in question.  Another \"saw it floating around,\" turned a\r\npage or two and \"saw\" the captions; and a third juror \"saw\" the\r\npamphlet.   Not until after mid-day did one of the other jurors\r\nadvise the judge of the pamphlet.  Obviously, members of the jury\r\nwere willing to receive the information and advice contained in the\r\npamphlet. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Furthermore, the jurors were less than forthcoming when\r\nquestioned by the judge. Compare State v. Rowell, supra.  Their\r\ndemeanor with regard to candor raises concern when viewed in\r\nconnection with daily admonitions by the trial judge that the only\r\nthing they were \"to consider is what they see and hear in that\r\ncourtroom, nothing more and nothing less.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n I would hold that the extraneous material in the jury room and\r\nthe presence of Juror O throughout most of the proceedings so\r\nprejudiced the outcome of both phases of appellant's trial that a\r\nnew trial is mandated. State v. Wasson, 299 S.C. 508, 386 S.E.2d\r\n255 (1989).  First, Juror O stated that she obtained the pamphlet\r\nprior to sequestration, which raises the stark implication that \r\n  \r\np.19\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nguilt was already presumed and that appellant's death sentence was\r\na foregone conclusion as a result of the jury being tainted by the\r\ninfluence of Juror O and through its exposure to the pamphlet. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Second, the inordinate brevity of jury deliberations in this\r\ncapital case under the circumstances here raises serious questions\r\nrelating to the deliberative process.          The jury required\r\napproximately thirty minutes to render the guilty verdict and less\r\nthan two hours to return the death sentence.  In my opinion, the\r\nrecord clearly infers that the jury was improperly influenced\r\nthroughout its deliberations by Juror O and the author's views as\r\nexpressed in the pamphlet. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The 32 page pamphlet, entitled God, Law, and Capital\r\nPunishment, by Richard W. De Haan, \"teacher of the Radio Bible\r\nClass, worldwide ministry through radio, television, literature\"\r\nbears a copyright date of 1974 and is a part of the record on\r\nappeal.    Author De Haan makes an impassioned plea in favor of\r\ncapital  punishment  and cites uncorroborated  facts  and\r\nunsubstantiated statistics to support his argument. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In my judgment, exposing appellant's jury to the pamphlet is\r\ntantamount to permitting an advocate of capital punishment to offer\r\nunauthorized evidence in circumvention of the constitution,\r\nstatutory and common law, and the rules of court; to make\r\nunregulated rebuttal of evidence properly admitted at trial; and to\r\npresent unrestrained argument in support of the death sentence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In charging his interpretation of God's law on capital\r\npunishment, the author assumes the role of pre-eminent trial judge\r\nand implies that where there may be conflict between the law as\r\ncharged by the state judge and that charged by the author, the\r\nauthor's instructions should be controlling.  Mr. De Haan, through\r\nhis pamphlet, is present in the jury room as a thirteenth juror\r\ndeliberating upon evidence and the law received from two sources -\r\nthe trial court and his pamphlet. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The following are excerpts from the pamphlet.  \"Over the past\r\ndecade, nearly 300 policemen have been killed while performing\r\ntheir duties.\" (pg. 1) Quoting the distraught father of a girl\r\nwho had been raped and murdered,\"This sort of thing has happened\r\nall too often, and must be stopped!\" (pg. 2) \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\nSTATE v.  KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I find it difficult to minimize the prejudicial effect of the\r\nfollowing comments upon the emotions of a jury considering the\r\nguilt and punishment of a defendant on trial for his life. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Whenever this principle of an \"eye for ad eye . . . \" is\r\n followed by a society, mankind is bettered.         God is\r\n pleased when this expression of His will            [capital\r\n punishment] is carried out  ... (pg. 13) We must  not fail\r\n to carry out the proper sentence [capital punishment]    . . .\r\n (pg. 14) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHe has given specific demands for the punishment of those\r\nwho break these laws, including the death penalty for\r\ndeliberate murder. . . . The Lord in His perfect holiness\r\nand justice therefore has ordained that the deliberate\r\nkiller must pay for his crime by forfeiting his own right\r\nto life.    (pp. 18-19)   Government must see to it that\r\nGod's principles are in force, and this includes capital\r\npunishment for willful murder. (p. 21) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n . . . In 1966 and 1967, when the death penalty was still on\r\n the books in our country, not one policeman was killed\r\n from ambush.  But during the 4 years from 1968 through\r\n 1971, after capital punishment was no longer a threat, 49\r\n policemen died as a result of being shot down. . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe price of leniency toward murderers is heavy. . . .\r\nHundreds of people have been slain by men released after\r\nserving time for a murder conviction.  J. Edgar Hoover\r\ntold a congressional subcommittee that 19.men who killed\r\npolicemen from 1960 to 1970 had previously been convicted\r\nof first-degree murder. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn conclusion, then, capital punishment is reasonable and\r\nfair. It meets God's holy demands of justice   . . .   Most\r\nimportant of all, it is commanded by God.          Through\r\nrevelation He established it as the way to deal with\r\nkillers.  He expects every society to carry it out, and\r\nis displeased when a community disregards this important\r\nobligation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Mr. De Haan concludes the chapter with a cautionary note to\r\nthe jury.  \"Let me ask you a personal question.  Are you prepared\r\nfor the day you must stand before God's tribunal?  His judgments\r\nare always fair, and He never makes mistakes.\" (pp. 21-23) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.21\r\n\r\nSTATE v.  KELLY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The trial court is under an obligation to safeguard the right\r\nto trial by an impartial jury throughout the proceedings.        The\r\nright to an impartial jury is not satisfied until the collective\r\njudgment of the jury is the product of a trial by an impartial\r\ntrier of fact, capable and willing to follow the law and render an\r\nimpartial verdict on the evidence. 50A C.J.S. Juries Â§ 225. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Although this dissent is specific as to Issue I of appellant's\r\nappeal, insofar as it relates to the impartiality of appellant's\r\ntrial jury, reference is made to Issue II.       The record reflects\r\nthat while he was a student in 1986, Juror P led a group of 40\r\nstudents on a trip to Columbia to support the execution of Terry\r\nRoach.    Voir dire examination for appellant's jury did not\r\nspecifically address Juror P's participation in a death penalty\r\nrally and the facts were not divulged prior to trial.             When\r\nquestioned about his \"position\" on the death penalty, Juror P\r\nadmitted that he had thought about the death penalty, but indicated\r\nthat he could be fair and impartial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n After the jury returned appellant's sentence, a newspaper\r\nquoted Juror P as saying, \"I think the only thing I regret is that\r\n [appellant] has only one life to give for the two he took.\" When\r\nconsidered in its totality, the compelling conclusion is that the\r\noutcome of both phases of appellant's trial was influenced by\r\ncumulative bias on the part of his jury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n I find that the interjection of extraneous facts and editorial\r\ncomments into the jury's deliberations created bias and prejudice\r\nagainst the appellant and affected the ability of the jury to\r\nrender fair and impartial verdicts at both phases of appellant's\r\nbifurcated trial.  I would reverse appellant's conviction and death\r\nsentence and remand for a new trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTOAL, A.
