\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent\r\n  pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits\r\n  misconduct and consents to the imposition of an admonition or a public\r\n  reprimand, agrees to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics\r\n  School and Trust Account School, and to pay the costs of these proceedings.Â  We\r\n  accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  Further, respondent shall\r\n  complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account\r\n  School within one (1) year of the date of this opinion and shall pay the costs\r\n  of these proceedings within thirty (30) days of this opinion.Â  The facts, as\r\n  set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent represented the plaintiff in a\r\n  post-divorce domestic action.Â  The parties reached a verbal agreement at a\r\n  hearing and the family court instructed respondent to draft a proposed order.Â \r\n  The next day, respondent faxed his original proposed order to opposing counsel\r\n  for review.Â  In response, opposing counsel drafted his own version of the\r\n  proposed order and faxed it to respondent.Â  Respondent has no record or\r\n  recollection of receiving opposing counsel's draft, but does not dispute\r\n  opposing counsel's records demonstrating his version of the draft order was\r\n  successfully faxed to respondent's office.\r\nUnaware of opposing counsel's response,\r\n  respondent again faxed his original proposed order to opposing counsel.Â  He\r\n  attached the same fax cover sheet he had previously used but marked &quot;second\r\n  request&quot; and the date at the bottom of the document.Â  Approximately a week\r\n  later, respondent submitted his proposed order to the family court along with a\r\n  copy of his fax cover sheet indicating he had made a third attempt to receive\r\n  opposing counsel's input on the proposed order before submitting it to the\r\n  court.Â  The fax cover sheet warned that the proposed order would be given to\r\n  the judge on a specific date if opposing counsel had not responded.Â  Although\r\n  he asserts he sent the &quot;third request&quot; fax to opposing counsel,\r\n  respondent cannot document transmission of the fax to opposing counsel and\r\n  opposing counsel insists he did not receive the &quot;third request&quot;\r\n  fax.Â Â  \r\nRespondent did not serve opposing counsel\r\n  with a copy of the proposed order when he submitted it to the family court.Â  It\r\n  was not until respondent received additional correspondence in which opposing\r\n  counsel inquired about the proposed order and asked respondent not to submit it\r\n  to the court until they reached an understanding that respondent advised he had\r\n  already submitted the order to the family court.Â  By that time, the judge had\r\n  already signed and filed the order.Â  Ultimately, additional litigation was\r\n  necessary to resolve issues opposing counsel had with the order.Â Â  \r\nRespondent admits his submission of the\r\n  proposed order to the family court without serving it at the same time and by\r\n  the same manner on opposing counsel violated Rule 5(b)(3), SCRCP.Â  He further\r\n  admits his conduct violated Rules 3.4(c) and 3.5(b), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR,\r\n  although he submits his violation of these rules was unintentional and\r\n  inadvertent.Â  Respondent believed when he submitted his original proposed order\r\n  to the court that he had complied with Rule 5, SCRCP, because he had previously\r\n  submitted it to opposing counsel for review and was unaware of opposing\r\n  counsel's response.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nComplainant A hired respondent to\r\n  represent her in a divorce action and custody action.Â  Respondent filed the\r\n  complaint.Â  At the temporary hearing, the family court awarded Complainant A\r\n  temporary custody, set visitation as Complainant A had requested, and appointed\r\n  a Guardian ad Litem (GAL).Â  The family court instructed respondent to prepare\r\n  the proposed order. \r\nBefore the order was drafted and signed,\r\n  Complainant A attempted to pay her portion of the GAL's retainer.Â  The GAL\r\n  would not accept payment until the court had issued a written order so\r\n  Complainant A submitted her check to respondent's office with the intention it\r\n  would be forwarded to the GAL at the appropriate time.Â  Respondent's assistant\r\n  mistakenly believed the check was for earned legal fees and deposited the check\r\n  into respondent's operating account.Â  The error was not discovered for many\r\n  months and was resolved only after the GAL threatened Complainant A with a\r\n  contempt action for failing to pay her portion of the retainer and Complainant\r\n  A twice informed respondent's office that she had submitted her portion of the\r\n  retainer to the office.Â  Respondent states that the first time Complainant A\r\n  informed his office that she had given the retainer check to the office, she\r\n  did not provide a copy of the check.Â  When she provided a copy of the check,\r\n  the error was quickly realized and resolved. \r\nThe temporary order respondent drafted\r\n  and the family court signed erroneously set visitation by reference to a\r\n  non-existent prior order rather than the pleadings.Â  Respondent explains he\r\n  erroneously referred to a prior order because the parties had been exercising\r\n  visitation as set out in the temporary order from a prior domestic action in\r\n  another county which had been previously dismissed for inactivity.Â Â  \r\nThe erroneous reference in the order\r\n  respondent drafted and the court signed resulted in confusion between the\r\n  parties.Â  Complainant A asked respondent to resolve the matter.Â  Respondent\r\n  attempted to have the order amended by consent, but the parties could not reach\r\n  agreement on the language for an amended order. \r\nRespondent admits he also failed to\r\n  timely communicate the father's request for extended summer visitation to\r\n  Complainant A.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nComplainant B hired respondent to\r\n  represent her in a domestic matter involving child custody, visitation, and\r\n  support.Â  At the time respondent was hired, the parties were operating under an\r\n  order from a prior action which gave custody of the child to the paternal\r\n  grandmother and required both parents to pay child support to her through the family\r\n  court.Â  \r\nSeveral months after the new action\r\n  commenced, Complainant B advised respondent the parties had reached an\r\n  agreement which opposing counsel would reduce to writing.Â  Respondent\r\n  repeatedly asked opposing counsel about the agreement, but did not receive any\r\n  substantive response for several months.Â  \r\nFinally, opposing counsel faxed a\r\n  proposed consent order to respondent.Â  It provided that physical custody would\r\n  be transferred to Complainant B, her child support arrearage would be forgiven\r\n  upon receipt of a specified partial payment, and she would begin receiving\r\n  child support from the father.Â  Respondent informed opposing counsel that the\r\n  proposed order was satisfactory and asked him to provide a signature page for\r\n  Complainant B to sign.Â  Opposing counsel never provided a signature page for\r\n  the parties to sign and did not submit the consent order to the family court\r\n  for more than one year.Â  However, in accordance with the parties' agreement,\r\n  Complainant B paid her child support arrearage and the child was placed in her\r\n  care.Â  While Complainant B was operating under the agreement but no order existed,\r\n  she could not prove the child was lawfully in her care, reportedly did not\r\n  receive child support from the father, and did not have an enforceable child\r\n  support order. Â Additionally, during this time, she was the subject of a\r\n  contempt proceeding for the arrearage she owed to the grandmother under the\r\n  prior order although that matter was successfully resolved with respondent's assistance.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he failed to adequately\r\n  follow up on the status of the proposed consent order or take other actions to\r\n  protect Complainant B's interests.Â Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent's bank reported that a check\r\n  drawn on his trust account was dishonored for insufficient funds.Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledges he issued a check to a client for the client's portion of a settlement\r\n  before depositing the settlement funds into his trust account.Â  Respondent\r\n  deposited the settlement funds on the same day he issued the check to his\r\n  client.Â  A review of respondent's trust account records revealed he had a\r\n  reserve of approximately $1,200.00 of his own funds in the account.Â  \r\nRespondent has now modified his office\r\n  practice to ensure funds are deposited and collected before they are disbursed.Â \r\n  Additionally, he has withdrawn his excess personal funds from his trust account\r\n  and now maintains only enough of his personal funds in the account as is\r\n  necessary to pay service charges.\r\nThroughout the investigation of these\r\n  matters, respondent has been fully cooperative with ODC.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence\r\n  and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client\r\n  reasonably informed about status of matter); Rule 1.15(a) (lawyer shall hold\r\n  property of client or third party which is in lawyer's possession in connection\r\n  with representation separately from lawyer's own property); Rule 1.15(b) (lawyer\r\n  may deposit the lawyerâ€™s own funds in client trust account for sole purpose of\r\n  paying service charges on that account, but only in amount necessary for that\r\n  purpose); Rule 1.15(d) (lawyer shall promptly deliver to client or third person\r\n  any funds or other property that client or third person is entitled to receive\r\n  and, upon request by client or third person, shall promptlyrender full accounting regarding such property); Rule\r\n  1.15(f) (lawyer shall not disburse funds from account containing the funds of\r\n  more than one client or third person unless funds to be disbursed have been\r\n  deposited in the account and are collected funds); Rule 3.4(c) (lawyer shall\r\n  not knowingly disobey obligation under the rules of a tribunal); and Rule 3.5(b)\r\n  (lawyer shall not communicate ex parte with a judge during proceeding unless\r\n  authorized to do so by law or court order).Â  Respondent acknowledges that\r\n  his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  Within one\r\n  (1) year of the date of this opinion, respondent shall complete the Legal\r\n  Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account School and, within\r\n  thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, he shall pay the costs of these\r\n  proceedings.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26897","title":"In the Matter of Harry Ennis Bodiford","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26897","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court publicly reprimanded a lawyer.","date":"2010-12-06","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Harry Ennis\r\n          Bodiford, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26897\r\nSubmitted November 8, 2010 - Filed December 6, 2010Â Â  \r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.\r\n          Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Susan B.

Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for a\r\n  lawyer to commit a criminal act involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,\r\n  fraud, deceit or misrepresentation);Â  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice).Â  \r\nFurther, respondent admits his\r\n  misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for lawyer to be convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or a\r\n  serious crime), and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to\r\n  bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct\r\n  demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender\r\n  his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26900","title":"In the Matter of Fred Wallace Woods, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26900","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court imposed a public reprimand on a lawyer.","date":"2010-12-06","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Fred\r\n          Wallace Woods, Jr., Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion\r\nNo. 26900\r\nSubmitted\r\nNovember 8, 2010 - Filed December 6, 2010Â Â  \r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.

Â In February 2008, a second defect in the deed was\r\n  discovered and corrected.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he\r\n  did not notify the purchaser of the problems with the recording of her deed or\r\n  the efforts he made to correct the same on her behalf.Â  The purchaser\r\n  independently learned that her deed had not been timely recorded and was\r\n  unaware at the time of her complaint that the deed had recently been properly\r\n  corrected and recorded.Â  \r\nMatter\r\n  III\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented the husband in a domestic case brought by the wife.Â  At the start\r\n  of a temporary hearing, respondent learned the court imposed an eight-page\r\n  limit on affidavits.Â  Respondent had intended to submit affidavits in excess of\r\n  the page limit and, thus, selected three affidavits which complied with the\r\n  court's rule.Â  Respondent did not bring copies of the affidavits and other\r\n  documents to the hearing.Â  The court and opposing counsel agreed to proceed\r\n  without the copies with the understanding opposing counsel would be provided\r\n  with copies upon the arrival of respondent's staff member. \r\nOne of the submitted\r\n  affidavits was that of respondent's client's mother who lived out-of-state, but\r\n  whose affidavit was notarized by a member of respondent's staff.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits the document was not signed or affirmed by the client's mother in the\r\n  notary's physical presence and it appears to have been signed by someone other\r\n  than the client's mother.\r\nRespondent explains\r\n  that he and his employee spoke with his client's mother by telephone and video\r\n  conference prior to mailing the affidavit to her and that he spoke with her\r\n  upon receipt of the signed affidavit.Â  Although respondent acknowledges he was\r\n  aware of how the document had been notarized and recognizes the notary\r\n  procedure used was improper, he believed his client's mother had signed the\r\n  document when he submitted it to the court.Â  He further notes that his client's\r\n  mother has since signed an affidavit which contains the same substantive\r\n  information as the first affidavit.Â  \r\nImmediately after the\r\n  hearing, respondent met with his client and employee in private before\r\n  providing opposing counsel with copies of the documents he had submitted to the\r\n  court.Â  Respondent provided opposing counsel with six affidavits, including\r\n  copies of the affidavits he had submitted to the court.Â  Â Five of the\r\n  affidavits bore &quot;original signatures&quot; for the affiants, while the\r\n  signature of the notary on each document was a photocopy.Â  Of those five\r\n  affidavits, two bore signatures appearing to be those of the affiants (the\r\n  client's sister and mother), although neither document had been signed by the\r\n  purported affiant and neither document indicated it was a conformed copy.Â  The\r\n  client's mother and sister later signed statements containing the same substantive\r\n  information contained in the original affidavits.\r\nSoon after the\r\n  hearing, respondent withdrew from the case as a result of a conflict of\r\n  interest unrelated to these allegations, although he continued to represent his\r\n  client for the limited purpose of preparing the temporary order requested by\r\n  the court.Â  Opposing counsel thereafter made several inquiries of respondent\r\n  and his staff in an attempt to identify the notary appearing on the affidavits\r\n  respondent had provided.Â  Respondent did not respond to the inquiries because\r\n  he did not believe he had a duty to confer with opposing counsel as to any\r\n  subject other than the proposed order. \r\nThe staff member who\r\n  notarized the affidavits provided to the court and opposing counsel in this\r\n  matter is the same staff member who notarized the documents in Matter I.Â  She\r\n  is no longer employed by respondent.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct,\r\n  he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation);\r\n  Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\r\n  representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed\r\n  about status of matter); Rule 3.3(a) (lawyer shall not knowingly offer false\r\n  evidence); Rule 5.3 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that\r\n  non-lawyer employee's conduct is compatible with professional obligations of\r\n  lawyer; lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of non-lawyer employee if lawyer\r\n  knows of conduct at time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated and\r\n  fails to take reasonable action); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct\r\n  for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for lawyer to engage\r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to engage in\r\n  conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct)\r\n  and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We\r\n  find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand\r\n  respondent for his misconduct.Â  Within one (1) year from the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall complete the Legal\r\n  Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account School and, within\r\n  twenty (20) days of the date of this opinion, he shall read and require each of\r\n  his employees to read the South Carolina Notary Public Manual published by the South\r\n  Carolina Secretary of State.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND. \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Zelenka, all of Columbia, and Solicitor\r\n  Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Appellant was convicted of two counts of murder, armed\r\n  robbery, and unlawful possession of a weapon, and received consecutive life\r\n  sentences for the murders, thirty years for armed robbery, and five years for\r\n  the weapons charge.Â  Appellant was tried jointly with Sharod Frazier.Â  On\r\n  appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in denying appellantâ€™s\r\n  mistrial motion, made after a Stateâ€™s witness committed a Bruton-type[1] error.Â  We agree and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Stateâ€™s primary\r\n  witness was Sammy Baker a/k/a Supercat.Â  Supercat testified about his\r\n  activities on November 16-17, 2004.Â  In relevant part, he testified that he\r\n  took his friend Rashad Sharice Thomas a/k/a Rock to meet up with Rockâ€™s friend,\r\n  co-defendant Frazier a/k/a Shy.Â  Eventually they picked up Shyâ€™s cousin,\r\n  appellant LeQuint Johnson a/k/a Q.Â  Supercat did not know appellant.Â  Rock\r\n  testified that Supercat, Shy, and appellant were together when they dropped him\r\n  off at his home around 9 pm on the 16th.Â  He did not see or hear\r\n  from them again.\r\nSupercat testified\r\n  that he, Shy, and appellant went to Nasty Catâ€™s club, a/k/a The Barn, where\r\n  Supercat saw his friend Tyrone Dinkins, a/k/a Good Buddy.Â  Supercat followed\r\n  Good Buddy, with Shy and appellant riding as passengers, to St. Charles Road\r\n  where people raced their cars and bet on the races.Â  The racing continued until\r\n  1 or 1:30 am November 17, when the racers decided to return to Nasty Catâ€™s\r\n  club.Â  Shy and appellant stayed in Supercatâ€™s car while at St. Charles Road,\r\n  and apparently no one saw them there just as no one had seen them earlier at\r\n  Nasty Catâ€™s club.Â  Bud Reames, an older man riding as a passenger with Good\r\n  Buddy, stayed in that car as well.\r\nWhen the racers\r\n  returned to Nasty Catâ€™s, Supercat testified he and Good Buddy went in the bar\r\n  but that Shy and appellant stayed in the car.Â  The club was closing, so\r\n  Supercat and Good Buddy drove to the Shell Station to buy gas.Â  A videotape\r\n  from the Shell Station shows Supercat and Good Buddy there around 2 am on the\r\n  morning of the 17th, although there was testimony that the time\r\n  might be off by an hour.\r\nAfter riding around\r\n  in their cars for a while, Supercat testified he challenged Good Buddy to a\r\n  race.Â  Good Buddy said to follow him, but that he had to stop and do something\r\n  under his hood before he could race.Â  Supercat testified Good Buddy pulled over\r\n  and Supercat pulled in behind him.Â  Supercat testified he got out of his car to\r\n  help Good Buddy, who was out of his car, when gunshots rang out.Â  Supercat\r\n  testified he saw Shy standing by Good Buddy.Â  When the gunfire ended, Shy told\r\n  Supercat to get in the car and drive, while appellant, also armed and outside\r\n  the car, told Shy they needed to kill Supercat.Â  As Supercat drove, Shy\r\n  threatened Supercatâ€™s sister, and then proceeded to count money.Â  Supercat\r\n  testified that he met up with Shy later at the Piggly Wiggly where Shy, who\r\n  told Supercat he was a Blood, threatened Supercat. Â A witness testified she\r\n  observed this long conversation and that Supercat looked fearful. \r\nAt 6:40 am on\r\n  November 17th, an officer was dispatched to check out a report of a\r\n  black male (Good Buddy) lying on the ground on the driverâ€™s side of a parked\r\n  car in which a second black male (Reames) was observed seated in the\r\n  passengerâ€™s seat.Â  A SLED crime scene investigator testified that the man on\r\n  the groundâ€™s pants pocket was turned inside out, and change was scattered\r\n  around the body and on top of it.Â  Good Buddy was known to carry a good deal of\r\n  cash.Â  It was clear the two men had been shot to death.\r\nThe forensic\r\n  pathologist testified Good Buddy had eight gunshot wounds from a 0.22.Â  Reames,\r\n  Good Buddyâ€™s passenger, had been shot twice with a 0.38 or a 0.357 magnum.Â \r\n  Their time of death was estimated to have been 5 am.Â  \r\nShy\r\n  and appellant were tried jointly.Â  Pre-trial, appellant sought a severance\r\n  because Shy had made a statement to the police which implicated himself and\r\n  another person (â€œKnockâ€).Â  Alternatively, appellant sought suppression of Shyâ€™s\r\n  statement.Â  In this statement, Shy stated that he and â€˜Knockâ€™ were present when\r\n  Supercat and another friend talked about getting Good Buddy.Â  According to the\r\n  statement, Shy and Knock were in Supercatâ€™s car when they went to a gas station,\r\n  then followed Good Buddy and pulled him over.Â  Supercat got out of the car and\r\n  â€œlet looseâ€ (i.e. shot) both people in Good Buddyâ€™s car, using a 0.22 on Good\r\n  Buddy and a 0.38 on the old guy (i.e. Reames).Â  Shy admitted he and Knock took\r\n  money from Good Buddyâ€™s pockets after Supercat killed him.Â  Shy did not\r\n  identify Knock.\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge denied both appellantâ€™s motion for a severance and his request that\r\n  Shyâ€™s statement not be admitted at their joint trial.Â  The State suggested that\r\n  Shyâ€™s statement could be redacted to eliminate the references to â€˜Knock.â€™Â  At\r\n  some point the trial judge apparently ruled that Shyâ€™s statement, with the two\r\n  references to â€˜Knockâ€™ redacted, would be admitted.[2]\r\nPrior\r\n  to the introduction of Shyâ€™s statement, the trial judge gave the jury this\r\n  charge:\r\n\r\n\tLadies\r\n  and gentlemen, youâ€™re going to see the document in evidence that I have\r\n  admitted.Â  Certain portions of that document contain information that is not\r\n  admissible in this case.Â  Information that is not admissible, you should not consider\r\n  in your deliberations.Â  So donâ€™t - the fact that you see a certain part of it\r\n  has been struck out, you should not consider that in any way.Â  You will see\r\n  those portions that are admissible in this case in your deliberations.Â  So\r\n  those that have been redacted have nothing to do and are not admissible to this\r\n  evidence in this case.\r\n\r\nSheriffâ€™s Investigator J.D.\r\n  Dellinger testified to this statement given to him by â€œShyâ€ Frazier:\r\n\r\n\tI met\r\n  Supercat in Churchwood.Â  I was on my way to work, but I stopped and began to\r\n  talk to Supercat.Â  I didnâ€™t go to work because I left with Supercat.Â  We drove\r\n  around for a while talking about who we going to rob for this day.Â  We went to\r\n  Nasty Catâ€™s Barn, then Supercat met Seneca.Â  They talked for a while on how\r\n  they were going to get Good Buddy.Â  Supercat stopped talking, then got in the\r\n  car and told me to drive off.Â  I did.\r\n\tWe went\r\n  to this gas station, then we followed Good Buddy.Â  We pulled him over.Â \r\n  Supercat jump out, talk for a second, then let loose on both people.Â  Me stayed in the car while Supercat let loose on both people.Â  Then\r\n\tme jumped out the car and got the money out of Good Buddyâ€™s pockets.Â  The gun\r\n  Supercat had used on Good Buddy was a .22 revolver and he used a .38 revolver\r\n  on old guy.\r\n\t(bold\r\n  representing points at where the words â€œand Knockâ€ were covered up with black\r\n  magic marker).\r\n\r\nInvestigator\r\n  Dellinger continued to testify to his observations at the scene, and towards\r\n  the end of his testimony the following exchange occurred between Investigator\r\n  Dellinger and the solicitor:\r\n\r\n\tQ.Â \r\n  Now, was [appellant] arrested?\r\n\tA.Â \r\n  Yes, sir, he was.\r\n\tQ.Â  And\r\n  the arrest of [appellant], how did that come about?\r\n\tA.Â \r\n  Based on our investigation.\r\n\tQ.Â \r\n  Based on your investigation.Â  And what else?\r\n\tA.Â  Iâ€™m\r\n  not sure I understand.\r\n\tQ.Â  The\r\n  conversation with Sammy Baker [Supercat]?\r\n\tA.Â  Mr.\r\n  Baker [Supercat] and Mr. Frazier [Shy].\r\n\tQ.Â \r\n  Okay.\r\n\r\nAppellant immediately moved\r\n  for a mistrial, arguing that the judgeâ€™s â€œredactionâ€ charge coupled with\r\n  Investigator Dellingerâ€™s testimony that his conversation (i.e., the one leading\r\n  to the statement) with Shy led to appellantâ€™s arrest effectively violated Bruton by allowing Shy, a non-testifying codefendant, to inculpate appellant.Â  Since\r\n  Shy did not testify, appellant was denied the ability to confront or\r\n  cross-examine him in violation of the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay\r\n  rules.Â  The judge found the error did not rise to the level requiring a\r\n  mistrial. \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the\r\n  trial judge err in denying appellantâ€™s mistrial motion?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe denial of a\r\n  mistrial motion following improper testimony by a Stateâ€™s witness is a matter\r\n  resting in the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion, and will be\r\n  overturned on appeal only where there is an abuse of discretion amounting to an\r\n  error of law.Â  State v. Crawley, 349 S.C. 459, 562 S.E.2d 683 (2002).Â \r\n  We find such an error here.\r\nThis case presents\r\n  an unusual Bruton-type issue.Â  Under Bruton, a non-testifying\r\n  co-defendantâ€™s confession that inculpates another defendant is inadmissible at\r\n  their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed that the confession can only\r\n  be used as evidence against the confessor.Â  However, such a confession may be admissible\r\n  if the confession is redacted in a way that removes any reference to the\r\n  non-testifying codefendant.Â  Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200 (1987); Gray\r\n    v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185 (1998).Â  \r\nShyâ€™s\r\n  confession was redacted to eliminate his references to â€œKnock;â€ there is,\r\n  however, no evidence that appellant is known as â€œKnock.â€Â  On the other hand,\r\n  the redacted confession clearly has had a name eliminated from it, and the jury\r\n  was charged about this omission.Â  Investigator Dellingerâ€™s statement that appellantâ€™s\r\n  arrest was based in part on Dellingerâ€™s â€œconversationâ€ with Shy, the same\r\n  conversation in which Shy gave his confession, effectively told the jury that\r\n  Shyâ€™s unredacted statement named appellant.Â  This evidence violated the hearsay\r\n  rules as well as appellantâ€™s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. \r\nThe\r\n  State argues this is not truly a Bruton error, citing United States\r\n    v. Akinkoye, 185 F.3d 192 (4th Cir. 1999).Â  In Akinkoye,\r\n  the codefendantsâ€™ confessions were retyped and the phrase â€œanother personâ€\r\n  substituted in each.Â  The fourth circuit held the redacted statement did not\r\n  facially implicate the other defendant.Â  Akinkoye is inapposite: the\r\n  issue here is not the redacted statement itself, but rather whether the\r\n  statement when combined with Investigator Dellingerâ€™s reluctant identification\r\n  of Shy as having implicated appellant in the crime was an error requiring that\r\n  the court grant a mistrial.Â  The State also argues harmless error based upon\r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s limiting instruction that the jury not consider anything\r\n  removed from the redacted statement.Â  This type of instruction cannot mitigate\r\n  a Confrontation Clause violation.Â  Bruton, supra.\r\nThere is no\r\n  overwhelming evidence against appellant, as only Supercatâ€™s testimony places\r\n  him at the scene and identifies him as a participant. Investigator Dellingerâ€™s\r\n  â€œinadvertent slipâ€ strongly implied that Shyâ€™s statement named appellant along\r\n  with â€œmeâ€ as present and participating, when in fact appellant was not\r\n  even named in that statement. \r\nAppellant\r\n  has demonstrated both constitutional error and prejudice.Â  The trial court\r\n  erred in denying his mistrial motion. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellantâ€™s\r\n  convictions are \r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  While I believe error was committed\r\n  at the trial court level, I do not believe that error is preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  The majority's opinion holds that the specific redaction created a Bruton violation. Â In my opinion, Frazierâ€™s statement should not have been redacted to\r\n  begin with.Â  The effect of the majority's opinion is to bring Bruton in\r\n  through the back door.Â  The purpose of the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s\r\n  holding in Bruton was to prevent a defendant from being implicated by\r\n  the statements or confession of a non-testifying co-defendant.Â  \r\nIn my mind, there is nothing in Frazierâ€™s statement\r\n  that implicates Johnson.Â  To the contrary, Frazier stated that he and â€œKnockâ€\r\n  were seated in Bakerâ€™s car at the time of the shooting.Â  Frazier's description\r\n  of Knock at the Jackson v. Denno hearing did not fit the description of\r\n  the defendant.Â  Frazier stated that Knock had braids.Â  At that same hearing,\r\n  Officer Dellinger admitted that when he interviewed Johnson shortly after the\r\n  murders, &quot;[h]is hair was cut short.&quot;Â  According to the trial\r\n  testimony of Baker, Johnson and Frazier are cousins.Â  However, Frazier's\r\n  testimony regarding the identity of Knock does not reflect a familial\r\n  relationship.Â  Frazier stated that Knock &quot;stay on the back street near the\r\n  man who sell juice and other things . . . .&quot;Â  Referring to how he knew\r\n  Knock, Frazier stated, &quot;I just got out in June and he get out in August.â€Â \r\n  When asked directly by defendantâ€™s counsel to whom he was referring when he\r\n  used the name Knock, Frazier elusively stated that â€œ[i]tâ€™s a person,â€ and then\r\n  denied that person was Johnson.Â  Therefore, Frazier's statement, in its\r\n  original form, did not implicate Johnson.Â  Had the full statement been before\r\n  the jury, Officer Dellinger's testimony would not have implicated Johnson.Â  It\r\n  was the redaction itself that implicated Johnson, and therefore I do not\r\n  believe these facts square with Bruton.\r\nDuring a pre-trial hearing, defense counsel motioned\r\n  the judge to either sever the trial or to rule Frazier's statement wholly\r\n  inadmissible.Â  The trial judge denied both these motions and instead chose to\r\n  redact any reference to Knock contained in Frazier's statement.Â  Why defense\r\n  counsel did not then object to the redaction of an exculpatory statement is a\r\n  mystery; however, that mystery may be better solved in a post-conviction relief\r\n  hearing. This issue is not preserved, nor does it properly raise a Bruton issue.Â \r\n  Therefore, I would affirm the conviction. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968).\r\n[2] Whether this redaction was necessary or appropriate is not before the Court.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26903","title":"Earthscapes v.

Bowen, of Laughlin &amp; Bowen, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This\r\n  action was commenced by Earthscapes Unlimited, Inc. (Respondent) in February\r\n  2006 by service of a summons, complaint, and lis pendens on Richard and Ann\r\n  Ulbrich (Appellants) seeking foreclosure of a mechanic's lien, alleging breach\r\n  of contract, and in the alternative, seeking judgment under quantum meruit.Â \r\n  Appellants' answer included a third-party claim against J.E. Black Construction\r\n  Company, Inc. (J.E. Black).Â  Respondent filed an amended complaint and lis pendens\r\n  adding all other mechanic's lien claimants as parties.Â  On September 7, 2007,\r\n  the circuit court entered an order in which it found J.E. Black to be in\r\n  default as to all parties for failing to comply with discovery and failure to\r\n  obtain counsel.Â  On December 28, 2007, the circuit court consolidated several\r\n  pending cases involving mechanic's liens seeking foreclosure on Appellants'\r\n  property, but the circuit court did not include this case in that consolidation.Â \r\n  On June 12, 2008, this case was tried without a jury resulting in an award for\r\n  Respondent in the amount of $26,342.80 in principal damages, pre-judgment\r\n  interest of $5,548.96, and costs and attorney's fees of $19,761.74.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  This Court certified this case for review pursuant to Rule\r\n  204(b), SCACR.Â  \r\nFacts\r\nRespondent\r\n  is a small landscape company doing business primarily in Berkeley Hall\r\n  Plantation (Berkeley) in Bluffton.Â  Respondent is not a licensed general\r\n  contractor.Â  On December 30, 2004, Appellants contracted with J.E. Black to\r\n  build their home inside Berkeley for $1,100,000.Â  Within the contract was a\r\n  $30,000 allowance for landscaping and an irrigation system.Â  Construction\r\n  within Berkeley is regulated by an Architectural Review Board (ARB).Â  In order\r\n  to receive a permit to construct a home in Berkeley it is necessary to obtain\r\n  approval of the ARB.Â  The ARB requires that all homes be landscaped, that a\r\n  landscape plan be submitted, and a landscape fee be paid in order to receive a\r\n  building permit.\r\nDuring the summer\r\n  of 2005, when the house was under construction, Richard Ulbrich (Ulbrich),\r\n  Appellant homeowner, met Donnie Ward (Ward), Respondent's owner and operator.Â \r\n  How the two first met is in dispute.Â  Ulbrich testified he was introduced to\r\n  Ward at Joseph Black's (Black) house, where Respondent provided landscaping\r\n  services.Â  Black is the owner of the general contractor J.E. Black.Â  Ward\r\n  testified he met Ulbrich one day as he was performing landscaping services on\r\n  the house adjacent to Appellants' lot.Â  Ward also testified that Ulbrich asked\r\n  if he would landscape Appellants' yard and draw up a landscape design for the\r\n  home.\r\nRespondent\r\n  submitted a proposal to Ulbrich for landscaping at the price of $32,677.89.Â \r\n  After reviewing the proposal, Ulbrich asked Respondent if he could perform the\r\n  work for $30,000.Â  Respondent agreed to do the work for $30,000.Â  Respondent\r\n  next obtained the landscaping permit from the ARB and commenced work on\r\n  Appellants' property.Â  Respondent's work on the property included ordering and\r\n  installing plant materials for the home, installing an irrigation system, and\r\n  installing landscape lighting.Â  The alleged contract for this work was never\r\n  put in writing.Â  Ward testified he failed to put the contract in writing\r\n  because of the friendship he forged with Ulbrich, hence, he did the work\r\n  &quot;on a handshake instead of a signature.&quot;\r\nDuring the course\r\n  of landscaping, Ulbrich asked Respondent to provide some additional work not\r\n  included in the original proposal.Â  This extra work included the installation\r\n  of drainage for water runoff, adding additional plant materials, and the\r\n  installation of a well for yard irrigation.Â  \r\nOn December 9,\r\n  2005, Respondent presented a bill to Appellants in the amount of $33,555.Â  This\r\n  bill included the agreed upon charge of $30,000 for the original work, $2,950\r\n  for the irrigation well, $320 for additional plants, and $285 for the extra\r\n  drainage work.Â  On December 23, 2005, Ulbrich issued a check to Respondent in\r\n  the amount of $3,270.[1]Â \r\n  Ulbrich then telephoned Respondent and informed him that he had paid the remainder\r\n  of the landscaping bill to the general contractor J.E. Black, that he would not\r\n  pay Respondent's bill, and that Respondent should ask J.E. Black for the\r\n  money.Â  Respondent served its mechanic's lien dated January 18, 2006 on\r\n  Appellants, and when no payment was forthcoming, filed this action on February\r\n  16, 2006.\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  held Respondent had a valid and subsisting mechanic's lien on Appellants'\r\n  property.Â  The circuit court distinguished the facts of the present case from\r\n  those in Skiba v. Gessner, 374 S.C. 208, 648 S.E.2d 605 (2007).Â  The\r\n  circuit court held Respondent actually performed labor and supplied materials\r\n  that attached to and became part of the real estate adding to its value.Â \r\n  However, in Skiba the party did not receive the protection of the\r\n  mechanic's lien statutes where the worker merely prepared land for landscaping\r\n  and did no work relating to a building or structure.[2]Â \r\n  The circuit court also found there was a contract between Appellants and\r\n  Respondent for the landscaping work performed on Appellants' property.Â  The\r\n  circuit court noted that absent its ruling on the mechanic's lien, it would\r\n  have found against Appellants for the same amount of money under the quantum\r\n  meruit claim.\r\nIssues\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court lack subject matter \r\n\t\t\tjurisdiction over the action?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in finding unjust \r\n\t\t\tenrichment to be an alternate form of recovery?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in finding that there was \r\n\t\t\ta contract between Appellants and Respondent?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in finding the mechanic's \r\n\t\t\tlien statutes applied?&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Subject\r\n  Matter Jurisdiction\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action.Â  Appellants\r\n  misconstrue this issue as an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  &quot;[S]ubject\r\n  matter jurisdiction refers to a court's constitutional or statutory power to\r\n  adjudicate a case.&quot;Â  Johnson v. S.C. Dep't of Prob., Parole, &amp;\r\n    Pardon Servs.,&nbsp;372 S.C. 279, 284, 641 S.E.2d 895, 897&nbsp;(2007) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  The circuit court clearly has subject matter jurisdiction to hear\r\n  disputes related to the mechanic's lien statutes and construction contracts.Â \r\n  The proper manner to couch this issue would be whether there is a statutory\r\n  prohibition against the enforcement of the alleged contract and mechanic's lien\r\n  at issue.Â  However, because Appellants did not raise section 40-11-370 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code as an affirmative defense at any stage in the proceedings below,\r\n  we find this affirmative defense was not properly pled.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted above, the circuit court held Respondent had a valid and subsisting\r\n  mechanic's lien on Appellants' property by distinguishing Skiba and\r\n  finding Respondent actually performed labor and supplied materials that\r\n  attached to and became part of the real estate adding to its value.Â  Appellants\r\n  then submitted a Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider, arguing that the circuit\r\n  court should dismiss Respondent's claims because Respondent did not have a license\r\n  required by sections 40-11-20, -30 and -370 of the South Carolina Code.[3]Â \r\n  Hence, Respondent could not pursue a claim at law or in equity.Â  Appellants\r\n  never made a motion to amend their pleadings to incorporate the arguments\r\n  presented in their Rule 59(e) motion. \r\nA\r\n  party in replying to a preceding pleading shall affirmatively set forth his or\r\n  her defenses.Â  Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  &quot;Every defense, in law or fact, to a\r\n  cause of action in any pleading . . . shall be asserted in the responsive\r\n  pleading thereto . . . .&quot;Â  Rule 12(b), SCRCP; see also Strickland\r\n    v. Strickland,&nbsp;375 S.C. 76, 85, 650 S.E.2d 465, 470&nbsp;(2007) (&quot;[A]ffirmative\r\n  defenses to a cause of action in any pleading must generally be asserted in a party's\r\n  responsive pleading.&quot;).Â  &quot;Statutory prohibition is in the nature of\r\n  an affirmative defense precluding enforcement of a contract and should be pled.&quot;Â  Madren v. Bradford,&nbsp;378 S.C. 187, 193, 661 S.E.2d 390,\r\n  393&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (citing Costa and Sons Constr. Co. v. Long, 306\r\n  S.C. 465, 469, 412 S.E.2d 450, 453 (Ct. App. 1991)); see also Skiba,\r\n  374 S.C. at 210, 648 S.E.2d at 606 (noting that section 40-11-370 is an\r\n  affirmative defense).Â  &quot;The failure to plead an affirmative defense is\r\n  deemed a waiver of the right to assert it.&quot;Â  Whitehead v. State,\r\n  352 S.C. 215, 220, 574 S.E.2d 200, 202&nbsp;(2002).Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP provides\r\n  an exception to the waiver rule by permitting a party to amend his or her\r\n  pleadings to conform to the evidence.Â  Madren, 378 S.C. at 193, 661\r\n  S.E.2d at 393.Â  \r\nIn Madren,\r\n  there was a motion to dismiss prior to trial and a post-trial Rule 59(e) motion,\r\n  both arguing that sections 40-11-30 and -370 precluded a contract from being\r\n  enforced because the opposing party did not have a contractor's license.Â  Id. at 192, 661 S.E.2d at 393.Â  However, the party making those motions never made\r\n  a motion to amend its pleadings.Â  Id. at 193, 661 S.E.2d at 393.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of those motions on the\r\n  basis that the party making those motions &quot;should not be able to argue for\r\n  a potential benefit from an affirmative defense without his being required to\r\n  affirmatively plead it.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  this case, there was a Rule 59(e) post-trial motion filed arguing that section\r\n  40-11-370 of the South Carolina Code precludes the enforcement of this action.Â \r\n  However, Appellants never amended their pleadings to incorporate this\r\n  affirmative defense.Â  Appellants cannot benefit from an affirmative defense\r\n  that was never pled.Â  Hence, we affirm the circuit court's denial of Appellants'\r\n  Rule 59(e) post-trial motion. \r\nII.&nbsp; Quantum\r\n  Meruit\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the trial court erred in finding quantum meruit to be a basis upon which\r\n  Respondent can recover.Â  We disagree. \r\nAn action based on a theory of quantum meruit sounds in equity.Â  Columbia Wholesale Co., Inc. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130&nbsp;(1994)\r\n  (citation omitted). Â When reviewing an action\r\n  in equity, an appellate court reviews the evidence to determine facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Denman\r\n    v. City of Columbia,&nbsp;387 S.C. 131, 140, 691 S.E.2d 465, 470&nbsp;(2010).Â \r\n  Absent an express contract, recovery under quantum meruit is based on\r\n  quasi-contract.Â  Columbia Wholesale Co., Inc., 312 S.C. at 261, 440\r\n  S.E.2d at 130.Â  The elements of a quantum meruit claim are: (1) a benefit\r\n  conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) realization of that benefit\r\n  by the defendant; and (3) retention by the defendant of the benefit under\r\n  conditions that make it unjust for him to retain it without paying its value.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the circuit court held absent the mechanic's lien claim, &quot;I\r\n  would still find in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the\r\n  same amount of money under the quantum meruit, or unjust enrichment\r\n  claim.&quot; (italics in original).Â  The benefit conferred by Respondent to\r\n  Appellants was the work performed by Respondent on Appellants' property.Â  Appellants\r\n  have realized and enjoyed the benefit of the work performed by Respondent.Â \r\n  Finally, allowing Appellants to retain the benefit of Respondent's work without\r\n  paying its value under the circumstances of this case would be unjust.Â  Hence,\r\n  we find under the theory of quantum meruit Appellants owe Respondent the same\r\n  amount of damages awarded at the circuit court.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Contract\r\n  and Mechanic's Lien\r\nBecause\r\n  an appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive, an analysis of the remaining issues in\r\n  unnecessary.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598&nbsp;(1999).Â  Because we affirm the\r\n  circuit court on the quantum meruit claim, it is not necessary to determine\r\n  whether there was an express contract or whether the mechanic's lien statutes\r\n  apply to this factual scenario.[4]Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nBecause\r\n  Appellants never amended their pleadings to incorporate their affirmative\r\n  defense, we affirm the circuit court's denial of Appellants' Rule 59(e)\r\n  post-trial motion.Â  Moreover, we find that Appellants owe Respondent the same\r\n  amount of damages awarded at the circuit court under the theory of quantum\r\n  meruit.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] While a payment of $3,270 would leave a balance of $30,285, Respondent's claim\r\n  in the circuit court sought $30,000.Â  The circuit court awarded $26,342.80 in\r\n  principal damages to Respondent after subtracting for a credit due to\r\n  Appellants and for costs Appellants incurred.\r\n[2] Appellants did not raise the Skiba case until their Rule 59(e) motion.Â \r\n  It appears from the record that the circuit court judge's order of June 20,\r\n  2008 is the first mention of issues pertaining to Skiba.\r\n[3] Regarding license requirements necessary to contract\r\n  work, section 40-11-30 of the South Carolina Code states:\r\n\r\n\tNo entity or individual may practice as a\r\n  contractor by performing or offering to perform contracting work for which the\r\n  total cost of construction is greater than five thousand dollars for general\r\n  contracting or greater than five thousand dollars for mechanical contracting\r\n  without a license issued in accordance with this chapter. Â \r\n\r\n&quot;General\r\n  construction&quot; is defined as &quot;the\r\n  installation, replacement, or repair of a building, structure, highway, sewer,\r\n  grading, asphalt or concrete paving, or improvement of any kind to real\r\n  property.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-20(8) (2001).Â  &quot;General contractor&quot; is defined as &quot;an\r\n  entity which performs or supervises or offers to perform or supervise general\r\n  construction.&quot;Â  Id.Â§ 40-11-20(9).Â  A contractor's failure\r\n  to hold a license required by section 40-11-30 is governed by section 40-11-370\r\n  of the South Carolina Code, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\t(A) It is unlawful to use the term\r\n  &quot;licensed contractor&quot; or to perform or offer to perform general or\r\n  mechanical construction without first obtaining a license as required by this\r\n  chapter.\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\t(C) An entity which does not have a valid license as required by\r\n  this chapter may not bring an action either at law or in equity to enforce the\r\n  provisions of a contract. An entity that enters into a contract to engage in\r\n  construction in a name other than the name that appears on its license may not\r\n  bring an action either at law or in equity to enforce the provisions of the\r\n  contract.\r\n\r\n[4] While the circuit court did find there was a contract between the two parties\r\n  in this action, it never awarded damages because of a breach of that contract.Â \r\n  Rather, the circuit court chose the theory of quantum meruit as an alternate\r\n  remedy.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26904","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, Seventh Circuit Solicitor's\r\n  Office, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  HEARN: Anthony Andres Torres (&quot;Torres&quot;) appeals the circuit court's admission into evidence of autopsy photographs and a videotape\r\n  recording during the sentencing phase of his capital murder trial.Â Â  Torres\r\n  contends the photographs should have been excluded based on South Carolina Rule\r\n  of Evidence 403, and the videotape recording should have been excluded based on\r\n  either Rule 403 or Section 16-3-25(C)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2003).Â Â \r\n  We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn May of 2007, Union County Emergency Services\r\n  received a call reporting a one-car accident involving a van.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Torres was identified by witnesses in a police photo line-up as the driver of\r\n  the van. \r\nOfficers arrived on the scene of the accident shortly\r\n  after Torres fled the area and discovered that the van was registered in the\r\n  name of Ann Emery. Officers found Ann and her husband Charles Ray Emery's\r\n  (collectively &quot;the Emerys&quot;) belongings in the van, and based on that\r\n  discovery, requested a welfare check on their residence.Â  \r\nUpon arriving at the Emerys' residence and getting no\r\n  response at the front door, officers walked around the house to check for signs\r\n  of forced entry.Â  Finding none, officers entered the residence through an unsecured\r\n  door, immediately smelled the odor of gasoline, and noticed the house felt\r\n  hot.Â  Officers discovered the body of Charles Ray Emery lying face down on the\r\n  mattress in the bedroom. The body of Ann Emery was discovered on the floor\r\n  beside the bed after EMS arrived on scene. Â Due to the extent of their\r\n  injuries, neither body could be identified at the scene, and identification was\r\n  accomplished at the hospital during an autopsy. Â Due to the compromising\r\n  position of Ann Emery's body at the scene, a sexual assault kit was\r\n  administered. Â Semen taken from Ann Emery's body by way of the kit matched DNA\r\n  of Torres. Torres was indicted on: two counts of armed robbery; two counts of\r\n  murder; one count of burglary of a dwelling, first degree; one count of attempt\r\n  to burn; and one count of criminal sexual conduct, first degree.Â  A jury trial\r\n  was held, resulting in a verdict of guilty on all counts.\r\nDuring the sentencing phase, the State sought to\r\n  introduce a video recording showing prison guards using pepper-spray to force\r\n  Torres to comply with a pat-down request.Â  The events documented on the tape\r\n  occurred the night that Torres was found guilty.Â  Torres refused to allow\r\n  prison guards to touch him when the guards requested that he place his hands on\r\n  the wall for a pat-down.Â  The guards explained that the pat-down was policy and\r\n  indicated that if he continued to refuse, Torres would be pepper-sprayed.Â \r\n  Torres continued to resist after several requests for compliance, so the guards\r\n  used pepper-spray to restrain him.Â  Torres objected, citing Section\r\n  16-3-25(C)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2003); Rule 403, SCRE; and a\r\n  violation of Miranda v. Arizona.Â  However, the trial judge overruled\r\n  Torres' objections and admitted the video recording.Â  Additionally, the State\r\n  introduced sixteen autopsy photographs of the Emerys.Â  Torres objected again,\r\n  citing Rule 403. Â The trial judge excluded three of the photographs based on\r\n  Rule 403 and admitted the remaining thirteen. \r\nThe defense called various witnesses who testified regarding\r\n  Torres' mental issues throughout his childhood and adult life and his substance\r\n  abuse problems. Â James Aiken, a prison consultant, testified nothing in Torres'\r\n  records or in the video recording shown by the State gave him any concern about\r\n  Torres' ability to adapt to life in prison because wardens would be able to\r\n  manage his behavior. \r\nAt the end of the sentencing phase, the jury\r\n  recommended Torres be sentenced to death. Â The trial judge sentenced Torres to\r\n  death, finding the evidence warranted the imposition of the death penalty, and\r\n  the imposition was not the result of prejudice, passion, or any other arbitrary\r\n  factor.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tTorres raises two issues on appeal: \r\n\t\r\n\t\t1.&nbsp; Did the trial judge commit\r\n  reversible error at sentencing by allowing the State to introduce autopsy\r\n  photographs of the victims in violation of Rule 403, SCRE?\r\n\t\t2.&nbsp; Did the trial judge commit\r\n  reversible error at sentencing by allowing the State to introduce a video\r\n  recording of Torres being pepper-sprayed and subdued in the detention center in\r\n  violation of Section 16-3-25(C)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2003) and Rule\r\n  403, SCRE? \r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, &quot;[i]n criminal cases, an appellate\r\n  court reviews errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the\r\n  trial court unless clearly erroneous.&quot;Â  State v. Bryant, 372 S.C.\r\n  305, 312, 642 S.E.2d 582, 586 (2007). &quot;The relevance, materiality, and\r\n  admissibility of photographs are matters within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court and a ruling will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 184, 577 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Autopsy Photographs\r\nTorres contends the trial judge should have excluded\r\n  the autopsy photographs of the Emerys because the photographs were more\r\n  prejudicial than probative in violation of Rule 403, SCRE, and only served to\r\n  inflame the emotions of the jury.Â  We disagree, as we do not believe the trial\r\n  judge abused his discretion in admitting the photographs.Â  \r\nPhotographs calculated to arouse the sympathy or\r\n  prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are irrelevant or not\r\n  necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.Â  State v. Brazell,\r\n  325 S.C. 65, 78, 480 S.E.2d 64, 72 (1997).Â  Under Rule 403, SCRE, &quot;evidence\r\n  may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\n  danger of unfair prejudice.&quot;Â  To be classified as unfairly prejudicial,\r\n  photographs must have a &quot;tendency to suggest a decision on an improper\r\n  basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 55, 456 S.E.2d 357, 361 (1995) (internal quotation\r\n  omitted).Â  In the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial, the scope of the\r\n  probative value is much broader than the guilt phase.Â  See State v.\r\n    Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 289, 350 S.E.2d 180, 186 (1986).Â Â  \r\nThe State offered several autopsy photographs into\r\n  evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial.Â Â  The State argues that the\r\n  photographs were properly admitted because they corroborated witness testimony\r\n  and were introduced to illustrate the circumstances of the crime and the\r\n  character of the defendant.Â  It is well settled in this state that &quot;[i]f\r\n  the photograph serves to corroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of\r\n  discretion to admit it.&quot;Â  State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 508, 466\r\n  S.E.2d 349, 353 (1996); see also State v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 290, 676\r\n  S.E.2d 690, 697 (2009).Â  In addition, this Court has held that autopsy\r\n  photographs may be presented to the jury in an effort to show the circumstances\r\n  of the crime and character of the defendant.Â  See State v. Rosemond, 335\r\n  S.C. 593, 597, 518 S.E.2d 588, 590 (1999); State v. Burkhart, 371 S.C.\r\n  482, 487, 640 S.E.2d 450, 453 (2007). Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe doctor who performed the autopsy used the\r\n  introduced photographs during his testimony to illustrate the number of\r\n  injuries, location of the injuries, and manner in which the injuries were\r\n  committed.Â  We do not suggest that these autopsy photographs are mild and easy\r\n  to view; some of the photographs are close-ups of the victims' injuries and are\r\n  graphic in nature.Â  However, the purpose of the close-ups was to help identify\r\n  the nature of each particular injury.Â  The net effect of the photographs was to\r\n  show what Torres did to the Emerys, which goes straight to circumstances of the\r\n  crime.Â  \r\nMoreover, the trial judge did exercise his discretion\r\n  by excluding three of the State's photographs, ruling that they were\r\n  duplicative and prejudicial.Â  While the admitted photographs graphically depict\r\n  the injuries of the victim, this was a particularly horrific crime, and the admission\r\n  of the photographs did not unduly prejudice the jury.Â  See Brazell, 325\r\n  S.C. at 78, 480 S.E.2d at 72.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial judge's\r\n  decision to admit them. \r\nAlthough we affirm the admission of the photographs,\r\n  we take this opportunity to address an area of growing concern to this Court.Â \r\n  The photographs at issue in this case, while admissible, are at the outer\r\n  limits of what our law permits a jury to consider.Â  Moreover, the State also\r\n  sought to introduce evidence in the form of an autopsy dissection photo at\r\n  trial, which the trial judge wisely excluded.Â  Today, we strongly encourage all\r\n  solicitors to refrain from pushing the envelope on admissibility in order to\r\n  gain a victory which, in all likelihood, was already assured because of other\r\n  substantial evidence in the case.\r\nII.&nbsp; Video Recording\r\nAs part of its case-in-chief during the sentencing\r\n  phase, the State introduced a video recording of Torres in prison. Â Torres\r\n  argues that the introduction of this video recording injected an arbitrary\r\n  factor into the sentencing phase in violation of section 16-3-25(C)(1) and Rule\r\n  403, SCRE.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â  \r\nAs mentioned above, a trial judge has wide latitude\r\n  concerning the admissibility of evidence.Â  See Rosemond, 335 S.C. at\r\n  596, 518 S.E.2d at 589-90.Â  Nonetheless, section 16-3-25(C)(1) establishes that\r\n  a death sentence must be vacated if it was &quot;imposed under the influence of\r\n  passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. &quot;Â  \r\nEvidence admitted during the sentencing phase of a\r\n  capital murder trial must be relevant to the character of the defendant or the\r\n  circumstances of the crime.Â Â  See Burkhart, 371 S.C. at 487, 640 S.E.2d\r\n  at 453; State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 587, 300 S.E.2d 63, 72 (1982).Â \r\n  &quot;[A]daptability to prison life . . . is clearly admissible [ ] and . . . evidence\r\n  of the defendant's characteristics may include prison conditions if narrowly\r\n  tailored to demonstrate the defendant's personal behavior in those\r\n  conditions.&quot;Â  Burkhart, 371 S.C. at 488, 640 S.E.2d at 453\r\n  (emphasis added); see also State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 174, 478\r\n  S.E.2d 260, 270 (1996) (determining that defendant's future dangerousness and\r\n  his adaptability to prison life are legitimate interests in the sentencing\r\n  phase of a capital case). \r\nThe video recording in this case demonstrates exactly\r\n  the type of evidence that Burkhart permits.Â Â  The video shows Torres'\r\n  behavior in a routine prison situation where he repeatedly refused to accede to\r\n  prison guards' numerous requests to submit to a pat-down.Â  Because the video\r\n  recording is probative on the issue of Torres' adaptability to prison life,\r\n  which is a legitimate concern in the sentencing phase of a capital case, the\r\n  video does not introduce an arbitrary factor into the jury's determination.Â Â  \r\nNonetheless, this evidence is still subject to Rule\r\n  403, SCRE.Â  The appellate court reviews a trial judge's ruling on admissibility\r\n  of evidence pursuant to an abuse of discretion standard and gives great\r\n  deference to the trial court.Â  See State v. Holland, 385 S.C. 159, 171,\r\n  682 S.E.2d 898, 904 (Ct. App. 2009).Â Â Â  We believe the trial judge's ruling was\r\n  correct because the probative value far outweighs any prejudice stemming from\r\n  the video and any unfair prejudice is de minimis.Â Â  The video recording\r\n  presented the jury with competent evidence to showcase Torres' character and\r\n  adaptability to prison life by illustrating Torres in an actual routine prison\r\n  situation.Â Â  While prior testimony had already established Torres' prior\r\n  convictions and his problems with maintaining parole conditions, this video\r\n  recording was unique in its application to a specific parameter held by this\r\n  Court to not be arbitrary in the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial.Â  See\r\n    Burkhart, 371 S.C. at 488, 640 S.E.2d at 453.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs his final argument, Torres claims that introducing\r\n  the video recording gave undue emphasis to the evidence, relying on State v.\r\n    Gulledge, 277 S.C. 368, 287 S.E.2d 488 (1982).Â  We find Gulledge is readily\r\n  distinguishable from the present case.Â Â  Gulledge held that allowing the\r\n  jury to take a tape recording transcript into the jury room placed undue\r\n  emphasis on that evidence.Â  Id. at 371-72, 287 S.E.2d at 490.Â  Torres is\r\n  not arguing that the jury should not have been allowed to take the video into the\r\n  jury room; rather he argues the video should not have been introduced in the\r\n  first place.Â  Nothing in Gulledge supports the idea that the tape\r\n  recording was not appropriately introduced. Instead, Gulledge provides\r\n  that the trial judge should not have allowed the jury to take the tape\r\n  transcripts into the jury room.Â  Furthermore, the video recording here goes to\r\n  Torres' adaptability to prison life and character, factors which are clearly\r\n  relevant to the jury's sentencing decision.Â  See Burkhart, 371 S.C. at\r\n  488, 640 S.E.2d at 453.Â  Therefore, the trial judge properly allowed the video\r\n  into evidence. Â \r\nPROPORTIONALITY\r\n  REVIEW\r\nPursuant\r\n  to Section 16-3-25(C) of the South Carolina Code (2003), we must conduct a\r\n  proportionality review.Â  We find the death sentence was not the result of\r\n  passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.&nbsp; Furthermore, a review\r\n  of other decisions demonstrates that Appellant's sentence is neither excessive\r\n  nor disproportionate. &nbsp;See, e.g., State v. Allen, 386\r\n  S.C. 93, 687 S.E.2d 21 (2009) (involving double murder and arson); State v. Woods,\r\n  382 S.C. 153, 676 S.E.2d 128 (2009) (imposing the death penalty for murder,\r\n  first degree burglary, and criminal sexual conduct).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, we affirm\r\n  Appellant's death sentence.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

Lindemann, of Davidson &amp; Lindemann, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Appellant was injured when his employer's vehicle in\r\n  which he was riding as a passenger collided with a vehicle driven by an\r\n  uninsured driver.Â  Appellant has collected $13,520.21 in workers' compensation\r\n  benefits, and has a tort suit pending against the uninsured driver.Â  Respondent\r\n  issued an automobile liability policy to employer. Â It provides for $15,000 in\r\n  uninsured motorist (UM) coverage, but also has an offset clause for\r\n  compensation benefits.Â  Fifteen thousand dollars is the minimum coverage under\r\n  the UM statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 (2002).\r\nAppellant filed\r\n  this declaratory judgment action seeking a determination whether his tort\r\n  recovery can be offset against his compensation award if the result of that\r\n  offset would be to reduce his recovery under the UM provision below $15,000.Â \r\n  The trial court granted respondent summary judgment, holding that the policy's\r\n  offset clause[2] was &quot;valid and enforceable&quot; even if the effect were to reduce\r\n  appellant's recovery below the statutorily mandated minimum coverage.Â \r\n  Appellant appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Can a\r\n    workers' compensation offset clause be applied so as to reduce an employee's\r\n    recovery under an employer's automobile liability policy's UM coverage below\r\n    the statutory mandatory minimum?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAll motor vehicles\r\n  required to be registered in South Carolina must be insured.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-10-10; Â§ 56-10-220 (2004).Â  Pursuant to South Carolina's automobile\r\n  insurance statute, &quot;No automobile insurance policy . . . may be issued or\r\n  delivered unless it contains a provision by endorsement or otherwise\r\n  [providing] uninsured motorist [UM]&quot; coverage.Â  Â§ 38-77-150(A).[3]Â \r\n  However, this chapter also contains S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-220, titled\r\n  &quot;Additional liability which automobile insurance policy need not\r\n  cover,&quot; which provides:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    automobile policy need not insure any liability under the Workers' Compensation\r\n    Law nor any liability on account of bodily injury to an employee of the insured\r\n    while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured, or while\r\n    engaged in the operation, maintenance, or repair of the motor vehicle nor any\r\n    liability for damage to property owned by, rented to, in charge of, or\r\n    transported by the insured.\r\n\r\nThis case presents the novel\r\n  question whether, when an employer chooses to cover its non-domestic employee\r\n  under an automobile liability policy, the employee's recovery under the\r\n  policyâ€™s mandatory UM coverage can be reduced by, or offset against, the\r\n  workers compensation benefits received by the employee.\r\nWhen an employer\r\n  has chosen to insure his non-domestic employees under his automobile liability\r\n  policy, and a part of that policy has voluntary underinsured (UIM) coverage,\r\n  that policy may lawfully provide for a set-off of UIM benefits against the\r\n  compensation benefits received by an injured employee. Williamson v. U.S.\r\n    Fire Ins. Co., 314 S.C. 215, 442 S.E.2d 587 (1994).\r\nIn Williamson,\r\n  the Court was asked whether an employer's automobile liability policy which\r\n  contained a workers' compensation offset provision would apply to an employee\r\n  claim for UIM benefits.Â  The Williamson opinion noted that in Ferguson\r\n    v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 96, 198 S.E.2d 522 (1973), the\r\n  Court struck down a provision in an employee's own policy which purported to\r\n  offset workers compensation benefits against the employee's UM recovery.Â  In Ferguson,\r\n  the Court stated:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    public policy declared by our uninsured motorist statute imposes an obligation\r\n    on insurers to provide protection to their insureds against loss caused by\r\n    wrongful conduct of an uninsured motorist, and any limiting language in an\r\n    insurance contract which had the effect of providing less protection than made\r\n    obligatory by the statutes is contrary to public policy and is of no force and\r\n    effect.\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of the\r\n  predecessor to Â§ 38-77-220 in the Ferguson decision.Â  Appellant relies\r\n  on this passage from Ferguson to argue for reversal. \r\nWilliamson distinguished Ferguson because the policy in Ferguson was the employee's own while Williamson involved the employer's policy.Â \r\n  The Williamson opinion also states &quot;The same statute and public\r\n  policy does not operate in cases where voluntary coverage has been provided by\r\n  an employer.&quot;Â  It is not immediately clear what &quot;same statute&quot;\r\n  or &quot;voluntary coverage&quot; the Williamson court is referring to\r\n  here.Â  We conclude, and appellant agreed at oral argument, that the reference\r\n  to a statute is to Â§ 38-77-220.Â  Moreover, the reference to voluntary coverage\r\n  is not to UIM coverage, but rather to the employer's voluntary decision to\r\n  purchase bodily injury coverage for its non-domestic employees.\r\nThe\r\n  parties make much of the fact that the predecessor to Â§ 38-77-220 was not cited\r\n  in Ferguson.Â  We find the omission easily explainable as that statute\r\n  applies only to employers who are purchasing automobile insurance policies.[4]Â \r\n  SectionÂ  38-77-220 first permits an automobile policy to exclude &quot;any\r\n  liability under the Workers' Compensation Law.&quot;Â  Second, the statute\r\n  permits an employer to exclude an employee, other than a &quot;domestic,&quot;\r\n  altogether from bodily injury coverage under the policy.Â  Williamson, supra; see also State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. James, 337 S.C. 86, 522\r\n  S.E.2d 345 (Ct. App. 1999) (repeating this holding).Â  \r\nSection\r\n  38-77-220 can only apply to employers as only they can &quot;insure any\r\n  liability under&quot; compensation law or have employees.Â  Williamson also\r\n  holds that one of the policies underlying Â§ 38-77-220 is to relieve the\r\n  employer of paying double premiums, one to its workers' compensation carrier\r\n  and one to its automobile liability policy carrier, a policy consideration\r\n  which is not applicable to employees.Â  Read in context, and made somewhat more\r\n  clear in the nextÂ  paragraph of the opinion, Williamson holds not only\r\n  that Â§ 38-77-220 did not apply in Ferguson, but that also the public\r\n  policy against permitting an offset against UM benefits expressed in Ferguson does not apply to employer-purchased liability policies.\r\nAppellant also\r\n  relies on the following passage from Williamson to argue that the\r\n  compensation offset is only available to an employer who voluntarily purchases\r\n  UIM coverage and not to the statutorily mandated UM coverage:\r\n\r\n  As long\r\n    as the employee is able to fully recover the damages sustained, we believe the\r\n    better public policy is to encourage employer voluntary coverage by not\r\n    exposing employers to mandatory duplicative insurance premiums and by not\r\n    allowing duplicative recoveries by employees.Â  We therefore hold that S.C. CODE\r\n    ANN. Â§ 38-77-220 (1989) allows an employer's automobile insurance carrier to\r\n    offset workers' compensation benefits received by an employee.Â  The offset\r\n    shall be applied against the total of damages sustained once the employee has\r\n    been fully compensated for the injuries.\r\n  Williamson,\r\n    314 S.C. at 219, 442 S.E.2d at 589.\r\n\r\nRead in context, the\r\n  &quot;voluntary&quot; reference in this Williamson passage and in the passage\r\n  cited earlier, is to employers who voluntarily decide to cover their\r\n  non-domestic employees despite the opt-out provision of Â§ 38-77-220 and not, as\r\n  appellant would read it, to voluntary coverages such as UIM.\r\nThe public policy\r\n  of this State is to encourage employers to voluntarily purchase bodily injury\r\n  coverage for their employees in their automobile liability policies.Â  Williamson, supra.Â  Once such policy is bought, it will necessarily include\r\n  mandatory UM coverage as required by Â§ 38-77-150. Â See Antley v.\r\n    Nobel Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 621, 567 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If an\r\n  employer opts to provide voluntary bodily injury coverage for his employees, no\r\n  public policy is violated if the employer is permitted to offset the employee's\r\n  recovery under the automobile policy against the employee's compensation\r\n  benefits, so long as that offset does not operate so as to make the employee\r\n  less than whole.Â  Here, assuming appellant receives some recovery in his tort\r\n  suit against the uninsured driver, the first $13,520.21 of that recovery will\r\n  be offset against the policy, and appellant will then draw against the $15,000\r\n  in employer-provided UM coverage until his damages are paid or the policy limit\r\n  is reached.[5]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  order permitting respondent to offset appellant's workers' compensation\r\n  benefits against his recovery under the automobile liability policy is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and J. Ernest Kinard, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] As of this juncture there is no class action.\r\n[2] Respondent's policy covers the\r\n  following &quot;limit of liability:&quot;\r\n\r\n  3.Â  Any amount payable under this insurance shall be\r\n    reduced by:\r\n  \r\n    a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â All sums paid or payable under\r\n      any workers' compensation . . . law\r\n  \r\n\r\n[3] Subject, of course, to persons who opt to be uninsured under Â§ 56-10-510.\r\n[4] To the extent State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231,\r\n  530 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000) conflicts with this interpretation of Â§\r\n  38-77-220, it is overruled.\r\n[5] To the extent that Antley indicates that the Court of Appeals would\r\n  reach a different result, it is overruled.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2010-12-16-02","description":"","date":"2010-12-20","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn re: Amendments to the Rules of  Professional Conduct, \r\nRule 407, SCACR, and the Code of Judicial  Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe Commission on Lawyer  Conduct and the Commission on Judicial Conduct have proposed certain amendments  to the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and the Code of Judicial  Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR.&nbsp; The Commission on Lawyer Conduct  proposes amending Rule 7.3(d)(3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule  407, SCACR, to update the contact information for the Commission on Lawyer  Conduct.&nbsp; The Commission on Judicial  Conduct proposes amending the Terminology section of the Code of Judicial  Conduct to include a definition of &quot;serious crime&quot; and revising Canon  3(D) to require that judges self-report arrests for certain crimes.\r\nPursuant to Article V, &sect; 4, of the South Carolina Constitution,  we hereby adopt the proposed amendments.&nbsp;  These amendments shall become effective immediately.&nbsp; A copy of the amended rules is attached.\r\nIT  IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     s/Jean H.

Shore and Jan Shore's (Petitioners) request for a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the court of appealsâ€™ decision in Linda\r\n    Mc Company, Inc. v. Shore, 375 S.C. 432, 653 S.E.2d 279&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2007) affirming the trial court's issuance of an order to execute and levy a\r\n  judgment against Petitioners.Â  Petitioners have submitted a petition for\r\n  rehearing which we now deny.Â  Also, this opinion is submitted in place of the\r\n  opinion previously issued in this case.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  December 8, 1994, Petitioners agreed to give The Linda Mc Company, Inc.\r\n  (Respondent) a judgment by confession as settlement of litigation over unpaid\r\n  sales commissions.Â  That judgment was entered June 2, 1995,[1] and provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  1. [Petitioners] confess judgment to [Respondent] in the amount of\r\n    $110,000.00 and hereby authorize the Clerk of Court for Lancaster County, South\r\n    Carolina, to enter judgment in favor of [Respondent]\r\n    against [Petitioners], jointly and severally, for such amount, plus such costs\r\n    and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by [Respondent]\r\n    in enforcing the unconditional guaranty, a copy of which is attached hereto as\r\n    Exhibit 1 (the â€œGuarantyâ€).Â  [Petitioners] further waive the service of any\r\n    summons and complaint praying for such judgment.Â  \r\n  2. [Petitioners] agree that [Respondent] may immediately, by affidavit through its\r\n    attorneys, set forth the correct amount of this Judgment by adjusting the\r\n    amount stated above for any credits previously applied by [Respondent], and that [Respondent] may apply to\r\n    a court of competent jurisdiction for a judgment against [Petitioners], jointly\r\n    and severally, in the amount of the total sum due and owing hereunder, plus\r\n    costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by [Respondent]\r\n    in enforcing the Guaranty, without further notice to [Petitioners] and without\r\n    further authority from [Petitioners]; provided, however, that in no event may\r\n    said sum exceed $110,000.00, plus costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred\r\n    by [Respondent] in enforcing\r\n    the Guaranty.Â  [Petitioners] authorize the entry of judgment for the amount due\r\n    and owing as set out in the affidavit, which judgment will continue to bear\r\n    interest at the highest legal rate permitted by law. Â The Judgment by\r\n    Confession is not contingent upon any other considerations or proceedings and\r\n    the Court is authorized to enter judgment for the amount set forth in the\r\n    affidavit.\r\n\r\nSometime\r\n  after the judgment was entered, Petitioners paid Respondent $55,000.Â  On\r\n  February 20, 2004, Respondent wrote a letter to Petitioners acknowledging an\r\n  agreement to waive all post-judgment interest if Respondent received the remaining\r\n  $55,000 before May 7, 2004.Â  Petitioners paid Respondent $26,750 by check dated\r\n  May 13, 2004.[2]Â  \r\nOn\r\n  July 29, 2004, Respondent filed a petition for supplemental proceedings\r\n  alleging that Petitioners possessed assets subject to execution on the\r\n  judgment.Â  Petitioners issued a check to Respondent in the amount of $28,500 on\r\n  August 3, 2004.Â  On August 9, 2004, the trial court granted Respondent's\r\n  petition for supplemental proceedings and referred the matter to a special\r\n  referee.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 1, 2004, the special referee conducted a hearing to determine whether\r\n  Petitioners had any assets that could satisfy the balance of the judgment.Â \r\n  Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, alleging the\r\n  judgment was void.Â  Petitioners' motion was denied and the special referee\r\n  concluded the judgment was valid and enforceable. \r\nOn\r\n  May 24, 2005, the special referee conducted another hearing at which\r\n  Petitioners argued the February 20, 2004 agreement was modified by a phone\r\n  message left by Jan Shore (Jan) to Respondent's attorney such that the parties\r\n  reached an accord and satisfaction.Â  Jan testified that on May 13, 2004 she\r\n  called and left a message on Respondent's attorney's answering machine stating\r\n  she intended to split the remainder of the balance into two payments and\r\n  &quot;that if there was any problem with that to please call me.&quot;[3]Â \r\n  In that message she also stated she would pay the balance by the end of the\r\n  next quarter, which would have been July or August.Â  Respondent's attorney\r\n  testified that he recalled receiving phone calls from Petitioners but did not\r\n  know what they were about and never called them back.[4]\r\nOn\r\n  June 3, 2005, the special referee issued his report to the circuit court\r\n  finding Petitioners owed interest outstanding from the entry of the judgment to\r\n  date, as well as costs and attorneys' fees, and there had been no accord and\r\n  satisfaction.Â  On that same day, the circuit court issued an order to execute\r\n  and levy upon assets owned by Petitioners.Â  Petitioners did not raise the\r\n  matter of the judgment's expiration in the trial court.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  appealed to the court of appeals, which held: (1) the absence of an affidavit\r\n  did not render the judgment void; (2) because Petitioners did not argue that\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-30 (2005) deprived the judgment of active energy to the\r\n  trial court, that issue was not preserved for appellate review; (3) there was\r\n  no accord and satisfaction; and (4) because estoppel was not presented to and\r\n  ruled upon by the trial court, it was not preserved for appellate review.Â  Linda\r\n    Mc Company, Inc., 375 S.C. at 437-42, 653 S.E.2d at 281-84.[5]Â \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\nISSUES\r\nI. Was\r\n  the entry of the judgment void because Respondent failed to follow the terms of\r\n  the parties' agreement to fix the amount of the judgment?\r\nII. Does\r\n  section 15-39-30 deprive the judgment of active energy?\r\nIII. Was\r\n  there an accord and satisfaction?\r\nIV. Should\r\n  Respondent be estopped from arguing that there was no accord agreement because\r\n  it did not respond to the phone message?\r\nV. Did\r\n  the expiration of the judgment render it and any supplemental proceedings to it\r\n  moot?\r\nVI. Did\r\n  the expiration of the judgment deprive the circuit court of jurisdiction to\r\n  proceed with supplemental proceedings or execution?\r\nVII. Did\r\n  the court of appeals decision establish an unworkable rule of procedure?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law.&quot;Â  Porter v.\r\n  Labor Depot,&nbsp;372 S.C. 560, 567, 643 S.E.2d 96, 100&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2007) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;The issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.&quot;Â  Jeter v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 369\r\n  S.C. 433, 438, 633 S.E.2d 143, 146&nbsp;(2006) (citation omitted).Â  An\r\n  appellate court may decide questions of law with no particular deference to the\r\n  trial court.Â  In re Campbell, 379 S.C. 593, 599, 666 S.E.2d 908,\r\n  911&nbsp;(2008) (citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI. Terms\r\n  of the Parties' Agreement\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue Respondent failed to follow the terms of the parties' agreement to fix\r\n  the amount of the judgment.Â  Thus, its entry was void and the court's actions\r\n  flowing from that entry are without jurisdiction.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-360 (2005) states: \r\nBefore a judgment by confession shall be entered a\r\n  statement in writing must be made and signed by the defendant and verified by\r\n  his oath to the following effect:\r\n\r\n  (1) It must state the amount for which judgment may be\r\n    entered and authorize the entry of judgment therefor; \r\n  (2) If it be for the money due or to become due, it\r\n    must state concisely the facts out of which it arose and must show that the sum\r\n    confessed therefor is justly due or to become due;Â  and \r\n  (3) If it be for the purpose of securing the plaintiff\r\n    against a contingent liability, it must state concisely the facts constituting\r\n    the liability and must show that the sum confessed therefor does not exceed the\r\n    liability. \r\n\r\nRule\r\n  60(b)(4), SCRCP provides the court may relieve a party or his legal\r\n  representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding if the judgment is\r\n  void.Â  &quot;The definition of 'void' under the rule only encompasses judgments\r\n  from courts which failed to provide proper due process, or judgments from\r\n  courts which lacked subject matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction.&quot;Â  McDaniel v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, 478 S.E.2d\r\n  868, 871&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (citations omitted). \r\nPetitioners\r\n  contend the lack of an affidavit from Respondent setting forth the exact amount\r\n  due under the judgment renders the judgment void.[6]Â \r\n  However, the language pertaining to the affidavit in the judgment is permissive\r\n  and not mandatory.Â  It states an affidavit setting forth the correct amount of\r\n  the judgment &quot;may&quot; be submitted by Respondent.Â  The judgment complies\r\n  with the statutory requirements of section 15-35-360 because it was made in\r\n  writing, signed by Petitioners, and verified by their oath.Â  Moreover, the lack\r\n  of an affidavit does not render the judgment void under Rule 60, SCRCP, because\r\n  the absence of an affidavit has no bearing on the subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  of the court.Â  Hence, because the judgment satisfies section 15-35-360 and the\r\n  submission of an affidavit was permissive and not mandatory, the court of\r\nappeals correctly held the judgment was not invalid for lack of an affidavit.Â Â \r\nII.&nbsp;Section\r\n  15-39-30\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue section 15-39-30 deprives the judgment of active energy and execution may\r\n  not issue thereon because ten years have passed since the entry of the judgment.Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals held this argument was not presented to the trial court and\r\n  was therefore not preserved for appellate review. Linda Mc Company, Inc.,\r\n  375 S.C. at 438, 653 S.E.2d at 282.Â  In reaching this conclusion the court of\r\n  appeals found &quot;our supreme court construes the ten-year time limit on\r\n  judgments in section 15-39-30 as a statute of limitations.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  440, 653 S.E.2d at 283.Â  Moreover, the court of appeals noted Petitioners had\r\n  the opportunity to raise the defense in a motion to amend their pleadings or a\r\n  motion to alter, amend, or vacate and did not do so.Â  Id. at 439, 653\r\n  S.E.2d at 282.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the court of appeals relied on LaRosa\r\n    v. Johnston,&nbsp; 328 S.C. 293, 493 S.E.2d 100&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997), in which\r\n  the debtor did assert the statutory defense as it became available by way of a\r\n  motion to alter.Â  Because the issue was preserved in that case, the court of\r\n  appeals reversed the court below and held the judgment expired seven days\r\n  before a master's order was filed compelling payment of LaRosa's judgment.Â  LaRosa,\r\n  328 S.C. at 297, 493 S.E.2d at 102.Â  Thus, the judgment expired and could not\r\n  be enforced.Â  It is clear from the court of appeals' holding in the present\r\n  case that if Petitioners had filed a motion to alter, amend, and vacate in the\r\n  trial court, its decision would have favored Petitioners.Â  While the proper\r\n  interpretation of section 15-39-30 will have no impact on the present case's\r\n  outcome because Petitioners lost on issue preservation grounds in the court of\r\n  appeals, it will have an impact on future litigants.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  Section 15-39-30 states:\r\n  Executions may issue upon final judgments or decrees\r\n    at any time within ten years from the date of the original entry thereof and\r\n    shall have active energy during such period, without any renewal or renewals\r\n    thereof, and this whether any return may or may not have been made during such\r\n    period on such executions.\r\n\r\nIn Hardee v. Lynch, 212 S.C. 6, 46 S.E.2d 179&nbsp;(1948), this Court\r\n  dismissed the argument that the statutory period in which an execution may\r\n  issue served as a statute of limitations, which would be considered waived\r\n  unless pleaded.Â Â  The Court in that case stated: \r\n\r\n  In order for a law to be a statute of limitations, it\r\n    must contain within itself a specific statement limiting the time within which\r\n    an action is to be brought. . . . [The statute at issue] provides no limitation\r\n    period, but completely destroys any right of action upon judgments. Â The\r\n    logical result of the [statute] was to utterly extinguish a judgment after the\r\n    expiration of ten years from the date of entry.\r\n\r\nHardee, 212 S.C. at 16-17, 46 S.E.2d at 183.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  court of appeals in this case committed error when it found section 15-39-30 is\r\n  a statute of limitations.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  the Court in Hardee also stated our state's statutes &quot;clearly\r\n  evince the legislative purpose to nullify the effective force of a judgment\r\n  after ten years, unless revived, or suit thereon be brought before the\r\n  expiration of the period allowed by law.&quot;Â  Id. at 14, 46 S.E.2d at\r\n  182; see also Hughes v. Slater, 214 S.C. 305, 312, 52\r\n  S.E.2d 419, 422&nbsp;(1949) (indicating filing an action preserves lien even\r\n  though statutory period expires while the matter is pending). Â But see Garrison v. Owens, 258 S.C. 442, 446-47, 189 S.E.2d 31, 33&nbsp;(1972)\r\n  (&quot;A judgment lien is purely statutory, its duration as fixed by the\r\n  legislature may not be prolonged by the courts and the bringing of an action to\r\n  enforce the lien will not preserve\r\n  it beyond the time fixed by the statute, if such time expires before the action\r\n  is tried.&quot;).[7]Â Â \r\n  Hence, while section 15-39-30 is not a statute of limitations, it operates like\r\n  a statute of limitations under the facts presented here.Â  We want to stress\r\n  that this is a narrow holding limited to facts similar to those at issue in\r\n  this case.Â  Hence, when a party has complied with the applicable statutes, as\r\n  Respondent did in this case, and is merely waiting on a court's order regarding\r\n  execution and levy, the ten year limitation found in section 15-39-30 is\r\n  extended to when the court finally issues an order.Â  To hold otherwise would\r\n  put those trying to enforce their judgments at the mercy of the court system to\r\n  conclude the matter within the ten-year period.[8]Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the judgment was entered June 2, 1995 and the order was issued June\r\n  3, 2005.Â  While the order came after the ten-year period, a petition for\r\n  supplemental proceedings was filed before the ten-year period expired.Â \r\n  Therefore, the judgment had active energy on June 3, 2005 because that order\r\n  was the result of the supplemental proceedings filed during the ten-year\r\n  period.Â  This result renders the court of appeals application of issue\r\n  preservation in this case moot.\r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, section 15-39-30 is not a statute of limitations but it does\r\n  operate similar to one under these factual circumstances.Â  Furthermore, if a\r\n  party takes action to enforce a judgment within the ten-year statutory period\r\n  of active energy, the resulting order will be effective even if issued after\r\n  the ten-year period has expired.Â  Hence, regarding this issue the decision of\r\n  the court of appeals should be affirmed as modified.Â  \r\nIII. Accord\r\n  and Satisfaction\r\nPetitioner\r\n  contends the court of appeals erred in affirming the special referee's decision\r\n  that there was no accord and satisfaction.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  an action at law, the appellate court will correct any error of law, but it\r\n  must affirm the special referee's factual findings unless there is no evidence\r\n  that reasonably supports those findings.&quot;Â  Roberts v. Gaskins, 327\r\n  S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (citation omitted). Â The\r\n  elements of an accord and satisfaction\r\n  are (1) an agreement between the parties to settle a dispute and (2) the\r\n  payment of the consideration which supports the agreement.Â  Historic\r\n    Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon, 381 S.C. 417, 430, 673 S.E.2d 448,\r\n  455&nbsp;(2009) (citation omitted).Â  Like any contract, in order to constitute an accord and satisfaction, there must\r\n  have been a meeting of the minds.Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  &quot;The\r\n  debtor must intend and make unmistakably clear that the payment tendered fully\r\n  satisfies the creditor's demand.&quot;Â  Tremont Const. Co., Inc. v. Dunlap,\r\n  310 S.C. 180, 182, 425 S.E.2d 792, 793&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992) (citation omitted).\r\n  Â &quot;Without an agreement to discharge the obligation there can be no accord,\r\n  and without an accord there can be no satisfaction.&quot;Â  Id. (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue that due to Jan's phone messages to counsel for Respondent, Respondent\r\n  was aware of Petitioners' proposal to modify the accord agreement, and by not\r\n  responding, Respondent accepted that proposal allowing for the remaining\r\n  payment to be late.Â  The special referee found there was never a meeting of the\r\n  minds such that an accord and satisfaction occurred.Â  Moreover, the special\r\n  referee found Petitioners did not comply with the terms of the February 20,\r\n  2004 agreement because payment of the outstanding balance came after the date\r\n  called for in the agreement.Â  The court of appeals correctly affirmed the special\r\n  referee's decision because there was never a meeting of the minds regarding the\r\n  alleged modification of the February 20 agreement.Â  It was never unmistakably\r\n  clear that the late payment and telephone message left to Respondent's attorney\r\n  modified the agreement.Â  Because there is evidence to support the special\r\n  referee's finding, the court of appeals correctly affirmed the special referee. \r\nIV. Estoppel\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue Respondent should be estopped from denying a modification of the\r\n  agreement took place.Â  This issue has not been preserved for review.\r\nPetitioners\r\n  contend Respondent had a duty to respond to Jan's phone message, and by not\r\n  responding they are now estopped from denying a modification of the agreement.Â \r\n  The court of appeals found this argument was neither presented to nor addressed\r\n  by the trial court and thus not preserved for appellate review.Â  See In re\r\n    Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732&nbsp;(2004) (&quot;In\r\n  order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by\r\n  the trial court.&quot;); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship,&nbsp;359 S.C.\r\n  505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715&nbsp;(2004) (&quot;It is well settled that, but for a\r\n  very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue\r\n  unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.&quot;).Â  The court\r\n  of appeals correctly held this issue is not preserved for appellate review\r\n  because it was not raised to and ruled upon below. \r\nV.&nbsp; Mootness\r\nPetitioners\r\n  contend the expiration of the judgment renders it and any proceedings\r\n  supplemental to it moot.Â  We disagree. \r\n&quot;An\r\n  appellate court will not pass on moot and academic questions or make an\r\n  adjudication where there remains no actual controversy.&quot;Â  Curtis v.\r\n    State,&nbsp;345 S.C. 557, 567, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596&nbsp;(2001) (citation\r\n  omitted). Â &quot;Moot appeals differ from unripe appeals in that moot appeals\r\n  result when intervening events render a case nonjusticiable.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted). Â &quot;'A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered,\r\n  will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy. Â This is\r\n  true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to\r\n  grant effectual relief.'&quot;Â  Id. at 567-68, 549 S.E.2d at 596\r\n  (quoting Mathis v. S.C. State\r\n    Highway Dep't, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973)).\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue an actual controversy ceased to exist upon the expiration of the\r\n  statutory period making the case moot.Â  Even if this Court agreed with\r\n  Petitioners' interpretation of section 15-39-30, there would still be a dispute\r\n  regarding issue preservation.Â  Nonetheless, there is an actual controversy\r\n  between the parties and expiration of the ten-year time limit did nothing to\r\n  extinguish that controversy or render this Court unable to grant effectual\r\n  relief.\r\nVI. Subject\r\n  Matter Jurisdiction\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue the expiration of the judgment deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction\r\n  to proceed with either the supplemental proceedings or execution.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â Â  \r\n&quot;Subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is 'the power to hear and determine cases of the general\r\n  class to which the proceedings in question belong.'&quot;Â  Dove v. Gold\r\n    Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600&nbsp;(1994) (quoting Bank\r\n      of Babylon v. Quirk, 472 A.2d 21, 22 (Conn. 1984)).Â  The issue of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time including when raised for the first\r\n  time to an appellate court.Â  See Tatnall v. Gardner, 350 S.C.\r\n  135, 137, 564 S.E.2d 377, 378 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nEven\r\n  if this Court were to hold that the expiration of the judgment foreclosed\r\n  Respondent's ability to enforce the judgment, it would not affect the subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction of the circuit court to hear the dispute.Â  The running of\r\n  the ten-year period does not influence the power of the circuit court to hear\r\n  disputes related to section 15-39-30.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nVII. Unworkable\r\n  Rule of Procedure\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues the effect of the court of appeals decision is to establish an\r\n  unworkable rule of procedure.Â  This issue has not been preserved for review.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  argument not made to an intermediate appellate court and ruled on by that court\r\n  is not preserved for review in this Court.Â  See City of Columbia v.\r\n    Ervin, 330 S.C. 516, 519-20, 500 S.E.2d 483, 485&nbsp;(1998).Â  Because this\r\n  issue was not presented to the court of appeals, it is not preserved for our\r\n  review. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons, the decision of the court of appeals is affirmed as\r\n  modified.Â  \r\nActing Justices James E.\r\n  Moore and John H. Waller, Jr., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in part, dissenting\r\n  in part in a separate opinion.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  While I concur in parts I,\r\n  III, IV, V, VI, and VII of the majority opinion, I disagree with the majority's\r\n  analysis in part II dealing with the import and interpretation of section\r\n  15-39-30.Â  The majority is correct in concluding that section 15-39-30 is not a\r\n  statute of limitation.Â  In my view, the majority is incorrect in concluding\r\n  that it operates similar to one under the facts of this case.\r\nSection\r\n  15-39-30 is not a statute of limitation, but it is clearly a statute of\r\n  repose.Â  There is a significant difference between the two.Â  A statute of\r\n  limitation is an affirmative defense that allows a party to avoid suit.Â  A\r\n  statute of limitation has no effect on the validity of the claim; it only\r\n  effects the claim's enforcement.Â  In contrast, a statute of repose is not a\r\n  claim-avoidance mechanism.Â  Instead, a statute of repose extinguishes the\r\n  claim, in this case the judgment.Â  As we have stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  A statute of limitations is a procedural device that\r\n    operates as a defense to limit the remedy available from an existing cause of\r\n    action.Â  A statute of repose creates a substantive right in those protected to\r\n    be free from liability after a legislatively determined period of time.Â  Langley\r\n      v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 403-04, 438 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1993).Â  A\r\n        statute of repose is typically an absolute time limit beyond which liability no\r\n        longer exists and is not tolled for any reason because to do so would upset the\r\n        economic balance struck by the legislative body.Â  Id. at 404, 438\r\n    S.E.2d at 243. \r\n\r\nCapco\r\n  of Summerville, Inc. v. J.H. Gayle Constr. Co., 368 S.C. 137, 142, 628 S.E.2d 38, 41 (2006)\r\n  (emphasis added); Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 138, 580 S.E.2d\r\n  109, 113-14 (2003).\r\nThis\r\n  Court has repeatedly stated that a statute of repose is not tolled for any\r\n  reason.Â  Langley v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 404, 438 S.E.2d 242, 243\r\n  (1993); Capco, 368 S.C. at 142, 628 S.E.2d at 41.Â  Therefore, in my\r\n  view, the majority's reliance on Hardee v. Lynch, 212 S.C. 6, 46 S.E.2d\r\n  179 (1948) and Hughes v. Slater, 214 S.C. 305, 52 S.E.2d 419 (1949) is\r\n  misplaced.Â  Neither case supports extending the life of a judgment after the\r\n  expiration of the statute of repose.Â  Furthermore, the majority's reference to\r\n  language in Hardee stating that our state's statutes &quot;clearly\r\n  evince a legislative purpose to nullify the effective force of a judgment after\r\n  ten years, unless revived, or suit thereon be brought&quot; is taken out of\r\n  context.Â  Hardee, 212 S.C. at 14, 46 S.E.2d at 182.Â  Additionally, it\r\n  ignores the fact that the statutory scheme referred to in Hardee has\r\n  been repealed and its obsolescence acknowledged by the Hardee court.Â  Id. at 13, 46 S.E.2d at 182.Â  The Hardee court was referring to the way\r\n  judgments were treated prior to the change in the law.Â  Although the judgment\r\n  in Hardee was more than ten years old, the applicable law affecting the\r\n  judgment allowed the judgment to be revived for another ten years if suit was\r\n  brought.Â  After the expiration of twenty years, there was a presumption of\r\n  payment.Â  This presumption of payment was effective unless the judgment\r\n  creditor brought suit prior to the expiration of the twenty-year period.Â  Id. at 12, 46 S.E.2d at 181.Â  The law, however, subsequently changed and eliminated\r\n  the possibility of suit on the judgment after twenty years.Â  The statute that\r\n  allowed for the revival of a judgment was also repealed, thus ending the active\r\n  energy of a judgment after ten years.Â  Id. at 13, 46 S.E.2d at 182.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching its conclusion, the Hardee court referred to its decision in United\r\n    States Rubber Company v. McManus, 211 S.C. 342, 45 S.E.2d 335 (1947), for\r\n  an understanding of the effects of Act No. 516 of the Acts of the General\r\n  Assembly for the year 1946, 44 Statutes at Large, 1436.Â  Hardee, 212\r\n  S.C. at 13, 46 S.E.2d at 181.Â  In recognizing that Act 516 radically changed\r\n  the operation and effect of existing statutes governing judgments, the McManus court stated:\r\n\r\n  Prior to the passage of the 1946 Act . . . the\r\n    limitation for bringing an action on a judgment was twenty years, Section 387,\r\n    subsection 1.Â  Section 743, subsection 1, provided that judgments shall\r\n    constitute a lien on the real estate of the judgment debtor for ten years from\r\n    date of entry.Â  And the procedure was set forth in subsections 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7\r\n    of Section 743 as to how judgments could be renewed or revived within the\r\n    period of ten years by the service of a summons upon the judgment debtor.Â \r\n    Section 745 permitted an action on a judgment after the lapse of twenty years\r\n    from the date of its entry.\r\n\r\nBy Act of the general assembly approved March 22,\r\n  1946, 44 Stat. at Large 1436, the legislature repealed subsection 1 of Section\r\n  387, thus taking away the right to bring an action upon a judgment within\r\n  twenty years.Â  The Act likewise repealed subsections 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of\r\n  Section 743 of the Code, which authorized the renewal or revival of judgments\r\n  within the period of ten years, and also repealed Section 745 of the Code,\r\n  which permitted an action upon a judgment after a lapse of twenty years from\r\n  the date of the original entry thereof.\r\nMcManus, 211\r\n  S.C. at 345-46, 45 S.E.2d at 336.\r\nAs\r\n  noted by the Hardee court, &quot;[t]he logical result of the 1946\r\n  enactment, 44 Stats. 1436, was to utterly extinguish a judgment after the\r\n  expiration of ten years from the date of entry.&quot;Â  Hardee, 212 S.C.\r\n  at 17, 46 S.E.2d at 183.\r\nThe Hardee court specifically declined to address the question of what\r\n  happens when a timely-filed action to enforce a judgment is not concluded prior\r\n  to the expiration of the ten-year repose period as it was unnecessary to\r\n  resolve the issue before it.Â  Hardee, 212 S.C. at 13, 46 S.E.2d at 182.Â \r\n  But, the Court in Garrison v. Owens, 258 S.C. 442, 189 S.E.2d 31 (1972),\r\n  squarely confronted the question and concluded that an action to enforce the\r\n  lien will not preserve it beyond the time by statute if such time expires before\r\n  the action is tried.Â  Id. at 446-47, 189 S.E.2d at 33 (&quot;A judgment\r\n  lien is purely statutory, its duration as fixed by the legislature may not be\r\n  prolonged by the courts and the bringing of an action to enforce the lien will\r\n  not preserve it beyond the time fixed by the statute, if such time expires\r\n  before the action is tried.&quot;).Â  I believe the Garrison court was\r\n  correct and, thus, I would uphold its decision.Â  If the law is to be changed,\r\n  it must be done by the Legislature not the Court.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent, and would vacate the Court\r\n  of Appeals' opinion and the circuit court's &quot;Order to Execute and\r\n  Levy&quot; filed June 3, 2005.Â  I concur fully in Justice Beatty's analysis of\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-30 (2005).Â  Moreover, any question whether a judgment\r\n  can be enforced more than ten years after it was filed is answered conclusively\r\n  by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-130 (2005).Â  This statute provides that the sheriff's\r\n  or other officer's authority to levy and execute final process ceases when the\r\n  judgment's &quot;active energy&quot; ends &quot;as provided by law,&quot; i.e.\r\n  ten years after the original entry of judgment.Â  In fact, an officer who fails\r\n  to return the process at the first regular term of common pleas after the\r\n  expiration of the judgment is subject to penalties for neglect of duty.Â  S. C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-140 (2005).\r\nÂ Since the judgment cannot be\r\n  enforced by execution and levy after ten years, it is futile to continue court\r\n  proceedings after that date.Â  Upon the passage of ten years, the judgment is\r\n  unenforceable as a matter of law, and all process related to it, whether in the\r\n  courts or in the hands of the sheriff or other officer, must cease.Â  Such a\r\n  bright line rule[9] benefits debtors, creditors, and other commercial\r\n  entities by allowing all interested parties to review the judgment rolls and\r\n  know with certainty the date upon which a judgment will lose its efficacy.\r\nSince the &quot;Order to\r\n  Execute and Levy&quot; cannot be performed as the judgment upon which it is\r\n  predicated has no &quot;active energy,&quot; I would vacate both the decision\r\n  of the Court of Appeals and that order itself.\r\nI respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The judgment was subject to execution and levy until June 2, 2005.\r\n[2] The sheriff sought to execute on the judgment, but the execution was returned\r\n  nulla bona.Â  Nulla bona is â€œ[a] form of return by a sheriff or constable upon\r\n  an execution when the judgment debtor has no seizable property within the\r\n  jurisdiction.â€ Â Black's Law Dictionary 1172 (9th ed. 2009).\r\n[3] Under the February 20, 2004 agreement the balance was due on May 7, hence the\r\n  May 13 partial payment and phone message came after the date the balance was to\r\n  be paid.\r\n[4] He testified that his secretary would check and log his messages, but often did\r\n  not include the substance of the message.\r\n[5] The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court.\r\n[6] Petitioners argue that the judgment required Respondent to submit an affidavit\r\n  setting forth the exact amount due under the judgment.Â  \r\n[7] The better and more equitable approach is that taken in Hardee.Â  The Garrison approach produces harsh results for those seeking to enforce judgments.Â  \r\n[8] LaRosa and Garrison are overruled to the extent they are\r\n  inconsistent with this opinion.Â  \r\n[9] I am unclear as to what action by a debtor can extend a judgmentâ€™s â€œactive\r\n  energy.â€Â  Either the period is extended so â€œlong as a party has taken steps\r\n  within the ten year period to enforce the judgmentâ€ or such an extension is\r\n  limited to the majorityâ€™s â€œnarrow holdingâ€ and â€œlimited to facts similar to\r\n  those at issue in this case.â€ \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
