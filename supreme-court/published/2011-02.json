Â§ 44-53-395 (2002).Â Â  After respondent\r\n  successfully completed the Pre-Trial Intervention Program, the solicitor\r\n  entered a nolle prosquei of the charge.Â Â Â  Â \r\nMatter II\r\nWhile employed by a law firm,\r\n  respondent represented Nationwide Insurance Company policyholders.Â  Between\r\n  October 2009 and December 2009, she submitted timesheets in one client's case\r\n  for attendance at twenty (20) roster meetings in Richland County.Â  It was later\r\n  discovered that the client's case had been removed from the roster in late 2008\r\n  pursuant to Rule 40(j), SCRCP.Â  It was further discovered that the billing for\r\n  the roster meetings and related entries were fabricated as respondent had not\r\n  attended any roster meetings in the case.Â  As a result of the fabricated\r\n  entries, Nationwide Insurance Company was overbilled in the approximate amount\r\n  of $10,566.00.Â  Respondent's law firm fully repaid Nationwide Insurance Company\r\n  for the overbilling.Â  The law firm represents it is not due any restitution\r\n  from respondent.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by her\r\n  misconduct she has violated the followingÂ  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not charge unreasonable fee), Rule 1.15\r\n  (lawyer shall safeguard client funds), Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 8.4(b) (lawyer shall not commit criminal\r\n  act that reflects adversely on lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as\r\n  lawyer in other respects), Rule 8.4(c)\r\n    (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act involving\r\n    moral turpitude), Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving\r\n    dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and Rule 8.4(e) (it is\r\n    professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to\r\n    the administration of justice).Â  In addition, respondent admits\r\n  that her actions constitute grounds for discipline under the following\r\n  provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a\r\n  ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\n  engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring\r\n  the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the\r\n  practice of law for nine (9) months, retroactive to the date of her interim\r\n  suspension.Â  Within thirty days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall\r\n  pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.Â  Within fifteen days of the filing of\r\n  this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating she has complied\r\n  with the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26923","title":"In the Matter of David C.

\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to the imposition of any sanction up to a two year definite suspension\r\n  from the practice of law.Â  See Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  He requests the suspension be made retroactive to June\r\n  22, 2009, the date of his interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Danielson,\r\n  383 S.C. 319, 679 S.E.2d 525 (2009).Â  Further, within one (1) year of the\r\n  Court's acceptance of the Agreement, respondent agrees to make full restitution\r\n  to all clients, persons, or other entities harmed as a result of his misconduct\r\n  and, before seeking reinstatement, to sign a monitoring agreement with Lawyers\r\n  Helping Lawyers. \r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement and impose a two (2) year Â suspension from the practice of\r\n  law, not retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â Â  Further,\r\n  within one (1) year of the date of this order, respondent shall pay full\r\n  restitution to all clients, persons, and entities harmed as a result of the\r\n  misconduct reported herein.Â  Before seeking reinstatement, respondent shall\r\n  enter into a monitoring agreement on terms recommended by Lawyers Helping\r\n  Lawyers.Â  \r\nThe facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent a client in a claim against a lender.Â  Respondent obtained\r\n  a favorable settlement for his client.Â Â  Counsel for the lender prepared and\r\n  transmitted a settlement package containing documents to be signed by\r\n  respondent's client.Â  Opposing counsel set a deadline for the execution and\r\n  return of the settlement documents.Â  \r\nRespondent had\r\n  difficulty contacting the client to arrange the execution of the settlement\r\n  documents and became fearful that his failure to timely reach the client might\r\n  result in the settlement being withdrawn.Â  Consequently, without the prior\r\n  consent or knowledge of the client, respondent signed the client's name to the\r\n  settlement documents, including the release and settlement agreement, the new\r\n  mortgage, and affidavit of the client.Â  Respondent then signed as witness to\r\n  the client's signature on the mortgage, falsely indicating that he had\r\n  witnessed the client sign the mortgage.Â  In addition, respondent had an\r\n  employee of his law firm falsely sign as witness to the client's signature.Â \r\n  Respondent then falsely signed as a notary public on the mortgage.Â  Respondent\r\n  had the employee falsely witness the client's affidavit and release and\r\n  settlement agreement.Â  Respondent sent the documents to opposing counsel who\r\n  had the mortgage recorded in the public record.Â  \r\nSubsequent to\r\n  the documents being sent to opposing counsel, the client contacted respondent's\r\n  firm about signing the documents.Â  Respondent readily admitted his misconduct\r\n  to his partners and self-reported the matter to Disciplinary Counsel.Â \r\n  Thereafter, the client signed new settlement documents which were forwarded to\r\n  opposing counsel.Â  The falsely executed documents were cancelled of record and\r\n  the new, properly executed documents were recorded in their place.Â  \r\nMatter II  \r\nRespondent\r\n  notarized that he had witnessed his client's signature on an Inventory and\r\n  Appraisement when, in fact, he had not witnessed the signature, but had,\r\n  instead, found the signed document in his &quot;inbox.&quot;Â Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nIn\r\n  December 2006, respondent was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder.Â \r\n  He received treatment until March of 2007 when he lost his health insurance and\r\n  could no longer afford his medication.Â  Respondent's depression worsened to the\r\n  point where he was unable to work on his client matters and failed to\r\n  communicate with his clients.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  was initially diligent in his representation of Client A, but as his depression\r\n  increased, respondent acknowledges he failed to communicate with this client\r\n  and failed to work on this client's case.Â  Respondent failed to comply with a\r\n  Final Decision of the South Carolina Bar Resolution of Fee Disputes Board which\r\n  awarded $400 to Client A.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent\r\n  was initially diligent in his representation of Client B, but as his depression\r\n  increased, respondent acknowledges he failed to communicate with this client\r\n  and failed to work on her case.Â  Client B was unable to obtain a copy of her\r\n  file because she could not reach respondent.Â  Respondent also failed to respond\r\n  to telephone calls and letters from the probate judge about this matter.Â Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent\r\n  met with Client C about several matters.Â  After reviewing the matters,\r\n  respondent informed Client C he could not assist him with two matters but would\r\n  represent him upon execution of a fee agreement and payment of $500 for a third\r\n  matter.Â  Client C paid respondent $200 but failed to execute the fee\r\n  agreement.Â  Respondent acknowledges that, as his depression increased, he\r\n  failed to communicate with Client C and failed to refund the $200 payment to\r\n  Client C.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent\r\n  met with Ms. Doe to discuss representation.Â  Ms. Doe did not retain respondent\r\n  but left documents with him.Â  Respondent acknowledges that he failed to respond\r\n  to Ms. Doe's telephone calls and, as a result, she was unable to obtain the\r\n  documents she left with him.Â  Respondent represents his depression prevented\r\n  him from properly handling this matter.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client D in a divorce matter.Â  After the final hearing, respondent\r\n  failed to promptly submit the final order to the judge and failed to prepare a QUADRO order and quit claim deed.Â Â  Respondent represents his depression\r\n  prevented him from properly representing this client.Â  \r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to adequately communicate with Client E and was unavailable when the\r\n  client attempted to contact him to retrieve documents in order to seek other\r\n  representation.Â Â  Respondent represents his depression prevented him from\r\n  properly representing this client.Â  \r\nMatter IX\r\nRespondent\r\n  was retained by Client F who paid a fee of $3,000.Â  Respondent failed to\r\n  adequately communicate with Client F and failed to work on the case due to his\r\n  depression.Â  Further, respondent failed to comply with a Final Decision of the\r\n  South Carolina Bar Resolution of Fee Disputes Board awarding $3,000 to Client F.Â  \r\nMatter X\r\nClient G\r\n  retained respondent to represent him in a matter.Â  Respondent asserts that, due\r\n  to his depression, he failed to adequately communicate with Client G and\r\n  stopped working on Client G's case\r\nMatter XI\r\nIn each\r\n  of the matters reported above, respondent was subpoenaed to appear to give a\r\n  statement to Disciplinary Counsel pursuant to Rule 19(c), RLDE.Â  Respondent\r\n  failed to appear in accordance with the subpoena.Â  Further, in several of the\r\n  matters, he did not respond to Disciplinary Counsel's Supplementary Notice of\r\n  Full Investigation.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413,\r\n  RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail\r\n  to comply with a subpoena issued under Rule 413, SCACR, or knowingly fail to respond\r\n  to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority to include a request for a\r\n  response or appearance under Rule 19, RLDE), Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground\r\n  for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office taken to practice law\r\n  in this state and contained in Rule 402(k), SCACR), and Rule 7(a)(10) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail to comply with a final\r\n  decision of the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board).Â  In addition, respondent\r\n  admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent\r\n  representation to client ); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable\r\n  diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4(a)(3) (lawyer shall\r\n  keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter); Rule 1.4(a)(4)\r\n  (lawyer shall promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule\r\n  1.15 (lawyer shall\r\n  promptly deliver to client or third person any funds or other property that\r\n  client or third person is entitled to receive); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make\r\n  reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of client);\r\n  Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for\r\n  information from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the\r\n    Rules of Professional Conduct).; and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct\r\n    for lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice).Â  Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement and suspend respondent from the practice of law for two\r\n  (2) years, not retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â Â \r\n  Within one (1) year of the date of this order, respondent shall pay full\r\n  restitution to all clients, persons, and entities harmed as a result of his misconduct\r\n  reported herein.Â  Before seeking reinstatement, respondent shall enter into a\r\n  monitoring agreement on terms recommended by Lawyers Helping Lawyers.Â  Within\r\n  fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and

Dedman, IV, both of Gallivan, White &amp; Boyd, of Greenville,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tGray T.\r\n  Culbreath, of Collins &amp; Lacy, of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae Association of\r\n  American Railroads. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  The City of Cayce\r\n  (&quot;City&quot;) cited Norfolk Southern Railway Company (&quot;Norfolk&quot;)\r\n  for violating a public nuisance ordinance, Cayce, SC, Code Â§ 28-251.Â  The citation was based on the condition of one\r\n  of Norfolk's bridges that was covered with rust and graffiti.Â  A municipal\r\n  judge found Norfolk guilty of violating the ordinance.Â  The circuit court\r\n  reversed based on its determination the ordinance was preempted by federal\r\n  law.Â  The City appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nNorfolk\r\n  is a corporation and common carrier of freight by rail.Â  It operates trains in\r\n  twenty-two states and has over 20,000 miles of track.Â  As part of these\r\n  operations, Norfolk ships goods in interstate commerce through South Carolina\r\n  and maintains tracks, yards, bridges, trestles, and other facilities within the\r\n  state.Â  \r\nNorfolk\r\n  owns or has a leasehold interest in a railroad bridge crossing over U.S.\r\n  Highway 321 in Cayce, South Carolina that is at the center of this dispute\r\n  (&quot;Bridge&quot;).[1]Â \r\n  The Bridge was constructed in 1955 and has been part of Norfolk's rail operations\r\n  since that time.Â  \r\nIn a series of\r\n  communications from 2005 to 2007, the City asked Norfolk to paint the Bridge\r\n  due to the rust and graffiti covering the structure.Â  The City noted the Bridge\r\n  is located on &quot;a main thoroughfare&quot; in the City and &quot;is an\r\n  eyesore and a nuisance&quot; that &quot;creates a negative impression about the\r\n  City and [Norfolk] for the thousands of people who drive through and reside in\r\n  the area.&quot;Â  The City asserted the Bridge's condition detracts from the\r\n  value of property in the surrounding area.Â  Norfolk declined, stating it did\r\n  not have funds available for the refurbishment.Â  \r\nOn May 1, 2007, the\r\n  City amended its municipal ordinance, Cayce, SC,Â  Code Â§&nbsp;28-251, to provide a public nuisance shall include\r\n  certain structures above street grade that are &quot;rusted.&quot;Â  Section\r\n  28-251 provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n\tPublic\r\n  nuisances affecting public order shall include, but not be limited to, the\r\n  following:\r\n\t(1)Â  All\r\n  structures bearing graffiti;\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\t(7)Â  All\r\n  privately-owned structures elevated above street grade and extending over or\r\n  across public streets or highways, such as overpasses, bridges, trestles or\r\n  elevated passageways, whose exterior finish is destroyed, decayed, dilapidated,\r\n  deteriorated or rusted.Â  \r\n\r\nThe 2007 amendment\r\n  added only subsection (7), as subsection (1) regarding structures bearing\r\n  graffiti existed in the prior version of the ordinance.[2]Â  \r\nThereafter in 2007,\r\n  the City cited Norfolk for violating section 28-251 based on the graffiti and\r\n  rust covering the Bridge.Â  After a bench trial, the municipal judge found\r\n  Norfolk guilty of violating the ordinance and fined Norfolk $500.00.Â  \r\nNorfolk appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the\r\n  municipal judge's ruling in an order filed July 30, 2009.Â  The circuit court\r\n  concluded the municipal ordinance is preempted by both the Interstate Commerce\r\n  Commission Termination Act (&quot;ICCTA&quot;), 49 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 10101-16106 (2007\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2010) and the Federal Railroad Safety Act (&quot;FRSA&quot;), 49\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 20101-20167 (2007 &amp; Supp. 2010).Â  Based on its ruling regarding\r\n  federal preemption, the circuit court noted it was unnecessary to reach the\r\n  additional grounds raised by Norfolk in support of reversal.Â  The City appeals\r\n  from this order. \r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn\r\n  criminal appeals from a municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a\r\n  de novo review; rather, it reviews the case for preserved errors raised to it\r\n  by an appropriate exception.Â  City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C.\r\n  12, 646 S.E.2d 879 (2007); Rogers v. State, 358 S.C. 266, 594 S.E.2d 278\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004); City of Landrum v. Sarratt, 352 S.C. 139, 572 S.E.2d\r\n  476 (Ct. App. 2002); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-105 (Supp. 2009)\r\n  (&quot;There shall be no trial de novo on any appeal from a municipal\r\n  court.&quot;).Â  &quot;Therefore, our scope of review is limited to correcting\r\n  the circuit court's order for errors of law.&quot;Â  Suchenski, 374 S.C.\r\n  at 15, 646 S.E.2d at 880; see also City of Aiken v. Koontz, 368\r\n  S.C. 542, 629 S.E.2d 686 (Ct. App. 2006) (observing that in reviewing criminal\r\n  cases, the appellate court's review is limited to reversal for errors of law).\r\nAnalysis\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the City argues the circuit court erred in reversing the municipal\r\n  court conviction because federal law does not preempt enforcement of the City's\r\n  ordinance.\r\nThe\r\n  City contends that, under the plain language of the City's ordinance,\r\n  structures covered by rust and graffiti fall within the definition of a public\r\n  nuisance.Â  Further, there are no factual disputes involved in this appeal as\r\n  both parties agree that the Bridge had extensive rust and graffiti on it when\r\n  the City issued the citation.Â  The City argues the circuit court therefore committed\r\n  an error of law in concluding the ordinance is rendered inapplicable to Norfolk\r\n  based on federal preemption.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nI.Â  Supremacy Clause\r\nThe\r\n  Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the United States Constitution establishes\r\n  the principle of federal preemption:\r\n\r\n\tThis Constitution, and the laws of the United States\r\n  which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made . . . under the\r\n  Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the\r\n  Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws\r\n  of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. Â \r\n\r\nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.\r\nSince the decision\r\n  in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316 (1819), it has been settled that\r\n  state law that conflicts with federal law is &quot;without effect.&quot; Cipollone\r\n    v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992); see also Maryland\r\n      v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 746 (1981) (&quot;It is basic to this\r\n  constitutional command that all conflicting state provisions be without\r\n  effect.&quot;).\r\nThe Supreme Court\r\n  of the United States has held there are two cornerstones to federal preemption\r\n  jurisprudence.Â  Wyeth v. Levine, 129 S.&nbsp;Ct. 1187 (2009).Â  First,\r\n  the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.Â  Id. at 1194.Â  Second, in all preemption cases, particularly in those in which\r\n  Congress has legislated in a field that the states have traditionally occupied,\r\n  the courts start with the assumption that the historical police powers of the\r\n  states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear\r\n  and manifest purpose of Congress.Â  Id. at 1194-95.Â  Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  intent of Congress may be explicitly stated in the statute's language or\r\n  implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.Â  Altria Group, Inc. v.\r\n    Good, 129 S. Ct. 538 (2008); Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 516.Â  In the\r\n  absence of an express congressional command, state law is preempted if the law\r\n  actually conflicts with federal law, or if federal law so thoroughly occupies\r\n  the legislative field as to make reasonable the inference that Congress has\r\n  left no room for the states to supplement it.Â  Altria Group, 129 S. Ct. at\r\n  543; Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 516.\r\nThus, &quot;[u]nder the principle of federal\r\n  law supremacy, there are three ways that federal law can preempt state law: (1)\r\n  where Congress makes its intent to preempt state law explicit in statutory\r\n  language; (2) where state law regulates conduct in a field that Congress\r\n  intends for the federal government to occupy exclusively; or (3) where there is\r\n  an actual conflict between state and federal law.&quot;Â  Anderson v. BNSF Ry.\r\n    Co., 291 S.W.3d 586, 589&nbsp;(Ark. 2009); see also Priester v.\r\n      Cromer,&nbsp;388 S.C. 425, 428, 697 S.E.2d 567, 569&nbsp;(2010) (&quot;A\r\n  federal law may either expressly preempt a state law through specific language\r\n  clearly stating its intent or it may impliedly preempt a state law through\r\n  field preemption or conflict preemption.&quot;). \r\nII.Â  ICCTA Preemption\r\nIn\r\n  the current matter, the circuit court ruled the City's ordinance is preempted\r\n  by the ICCTA.Â  \r\n&quot;As\r\n  the title of the legislation implies, ICCTA [the ICC Termination Act] abolished\r\n  the Interstate Commerce Commission, while simultaneously creating the Surface\r\n  Transportation Board (STB) to replace it and to perform many of the same\r\n  regulatory functions.&quot;Â  Anderson, 291 S.W.3d at 589.\r\nSection\r\n  10501(a)(1) of the ICCTA generally sets forth the STB's &quot;jurisdiction over\r\n  transportation by rail carrier.&quot;Â  49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 10501(a)(1) (2007).Â \r\n  Subsection (b) provides that the jurisdiction of the STB is exclusive, and it\r\n  contains an explicit preemption clause:\r\n\r\n\t(b) Â The\r\n  jurisdiction of the Board over-\r\n\t(1) transportation\r\n  by rail carriers, and the remedies provided in this part with respect to\r\n  rates, classifications, rules (including car service, interchange, and other\r\n  operating rules), practices, routes, services, and facilities of such\r\n    carriers; and\r\n\t(2) Â the\r\n  construction, acquisition, operation, abandonment, or discontinuance of\r\n  spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks, or facilities, even\r\n  if the tracks are located, or intended to be located, entirely in one State, \r\n\t\r\n\tis\r\n  exclusive. Except as otherwise\r\n  provided in this part, the remedies provided under this part with respect to\r\n    regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies\r\n    provided under Federal or State law.\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 10501(b) (emphasis added).\r\nWhen\r\n  a federal statute contains an express provision\r\n  regarding preemption, the preemption inquiry must focus on the plain wording of that provision, which generally\r\n  contains the most reliable evidence as to whether Congress intended to preempt\r\n  state law. Â CSX Transp. v. Easterwood, 507 U.S. 658 (1993).\r\nA\r\n  Georgia federal district court has remarked, &quot;It is difficult to imagine a\r\n  broader statement of Congress's intent to preempt state regulatory authority over\r\n  railroad operations.&quot;Â  CSX\r\n    Transp., Inc. v. Ga. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,\r\n  944 F. Supp. 1573, 1581&nbsp;(N.D. Ga. 1996).Â  The ICCTA &quot;grant[s] . . .\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction over almost all matters of rail regulation to the\r\n  STB.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nBy\r\n  its language, the ICCTA &quot;broadly precludes state regulation of those\r\n  matters [specified in 49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 10501(b)].&quot;Â  Burlington N. &amp;\r\n    Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Dep't of Transp., 206 P.3d 261, 263&nbsp;(Or. Ct. App.\r\n  2009).\r\nThe\r\n  broad nature of Congress's preemption under the ICCTA is further evidenced by\r\n  the ICCTA's expansive definitions.Â  The ICCTA defines a &quot;railroad&quot; as\r\n  including the following:\r\n\r\n\t(A) a bridge, car float, lighter, ferry, and\r\n  intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad;\r\n\t(B) the road used by a rail carrier and owned by it or\r\n  operated under an agreement; and\r\n\t(C) a switch, spur, track, terminal, terminal facility,\r\n  and a freight depot, yard, and ground, used or necessary for transportation[.]\r\n\r\n49 U.S.C.A. Â§ 10102(6) (2007)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The ICCTA defines &quot;transportation&quot; to encompass:\r\n\r\n\t(A) a locomotive, car, vehicle, vessel, warehouse, wharf,\r\n  pier, dock, yard, property, facility, instrumentality, or equipment of any kind\r\n  related to the movement of passengers or property, or both, by rail, regardless\r\n  of ownership or an agreement concerning use; and\r\n\t(B) services related to that movement, including receipt,\r\n  delivery, elevation, transfer in transit, refrigeration, icing, ventilation,\r\n  storage, handling, and interchange of passengers and property[.]\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 10102(9).Â  We agree with the circuit court's\r\n  observation that, considering the definitions contained in section 10102,\r\n  &quot;when [s]ection 10501(b) grants the STB exclusive jurisdiction over\r\n  'railroads' and 'transportation by rail carriers,' it includes the railroad's\r\n  bridges and any operations conducted thereupon for the purpose of\r\n  transportation.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  municipal judge found ICCTA preemption did not apply because there was no\r\n  specific federal regulation covering the appearance of railroad bridges.Â \r\n  However, we hold that ICCTA preemption does apply, even if there is no direct\r\n  conflict with a specific regulation, if the ordinance interferes with the\r\n  railroad's ability to conduct its operations or otherwise unreasonably burdens\r\n  interstate commerce.Â  Direct conflict is only one circumstance under which state\r\n  law is preempted by federal law.Â  Anderson, 291 S.W.3d at 589; Priester,\r\n  388 S.C. at 428, 697 S.E.2d at 569.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals of Washington found an express conflict was not required in a\r\n  case holding two city ordinances, one regulating the length of time railroad\r\n  switching activities could block city streets and the other prohibiting\r\n  switching during peak hours, were preempted by the ICCTA.Â  City of Seattle v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., 22 P.3d 260 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001).Â  The court\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tHere,\r\n  the City of Seattle claims the ordinances are merely local traffic regulations\r\n  which are not expressly preempted, or preempted in any other way, specifically\r\n  because there is no conflict between the ICCTA and the city's traffic\r\n  ordinances. Â We agree that state and local governments may retain certain\r\n  police powers and may apply non-discriminatory regulation to protect the public\r\n  health and safety, but under the ICCTA the actions or regulations of those\r\n  governments may not have the effect of foreclosing or restricting the\r\n  railroad's ability to conduct its operation or otherwise unreasonably burden\r\n  interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nId. at 262; see also City of Auburn v. United\r\n  States Gov't, 154 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 1998) (stating &quot;the\r\n  pivotal question is not the nature of the state regulation, but the language\r\n  and congressional intent of the specific federal statute&quot; and holding\r\n  state and local permitting laws were preempted by the ICCTA even though they\r\n  concerned &quot;environmental&quot; rather than &quot;economic&quot; regulation\r\n  because jurisprudence supports a broad reading of Congress's preemption intent,\r\n  not a narrow one).\r\nIn the current\r\n  appeal, James Carter, the Chief Engineer of Bridges and Structures for Norfolk,\r\n  testified that Norfolk operates trains in twenty-two states on over 20,000\r\n  miles of track. Carter stated Norfolk does not paint bridges for cosmetic\r\n  purposes, but that Norfolk had offered to allow the City to do it, and Norfolk\r\n  would have donated the expense for its employees to provide flagging services,\r\n  but the City had declined the offer.Â  Carter stated the City did not raise any\r\n  structural concerns about the Bridge.Â Â Â  \r\nHe testified\r\n  the most recent inspection at the time of trial had been on April 11, 2007, and\r\n  no safety or structural issues were then noted. Â Carter stated maintaining the\r\n  structural integrity of the Bridge and other structures was Norfolk's most\r\n  important consideration, and that Norfolk had to allocate its funds for safety\r\n  issues rather than for aesthetic concerns.Â  Carter stated graffiti on the\r\n  Bridge did not have any impact on the Bridge's structural integrity or safety.Â \r\n  Further, there had been no notation on the inspection report that the rust\r\n  posed a safety hazard.Â  \r\nCarter asserted the\r\n  impact of the City's ordinance on Norfolk would be more than just requiring it\r\n  to paint the Bridge.Â  He stated many of the older bridges were covered with\r\n  lead paint, and any painting would require removal of the old lead paint in an\r\n  environmentally safe manner.Â  He estimated it could cost approximately $250,000\r\n  to paint the entire Bridge, including the lead removal.Â  Carter opined that if\r\n  Norfolk were required to do that for all of its bridges in South Carolina, it\r\n  would cost millions of dollars, and this would have an impact upon Norfolk's\r\n  ability to devote its resources to safety-related projects. Â Carter stated it\r\n  would be difficult to operate a system of over 20,000 miles of track if the\r\n  regulations in each community were different, so a uniform set of regulations\r\n  was &quot;extremely important.&quot;Â  \r\nThe Association of\r\n  American Railroads (&quot;the Association&quot;) has filed an Amicus Curiae Brief\r\n  in support of the circuit court's determination that the City's ordinance is\r\n  preempted by the ICCTA.Â  The Association states this &quot;case presents an\r\n  issue of great significance to the railroad industry as a whole.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Association opines that, if the City's nuisance ordinance were upheld, and\r\n  other municipalities across the nation similarly declared railroad trestles,\r\n  bridges, and other structures bearing graffiti or rust to be a public nuisance\r\n  and subjected the railroads to criminal penalties or forced them to undertake\r\n  remedial measures, &quot;the interference with rail transportation operations\r\n  throughout the national rail network, as well as the adverse economic consequences\r\n  to the railroad industry, would be significant and would constitute an\r\n  unreasonable burden on interstate rail transportation.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Association argues case law makes clear that a state or a local law, whether\r\n  premised on environmental, zoning, nuisance, or as here, &quot;aesthetic&quot;\r\n  grounds, is not saved from preemption under the ICCTA by its ostensible\r\n  regulatory purpose or by the descriptive nomenclature used if its effect\r\n  otherwise falls with the scope of the ICCTA.Â  \r\nWe hold the circuit\r\n  court correctly determined the ICCTA preempts enforcement of the nuisance ordinance\r\n  against Norfolk.Â  Bridges are expressly considered part of the railroad's\r\n  operations under the definitional section of the ICCTA and the enforcement of\r\n  the City's ordinance against Norfolk will have an effect on its railroad\r\n  operations that falls within the scope of the ICCTA.Â  See, e.g., Village\r\n    of Mundelein v. Wis. Cent. R.R., 882 N.E.2d 544, 552 (Ill. 2008) (&quot;A\r\n  state law may not frustrate the operation of federal law by claiming some\r\n  purpose other than that specifically addressed by the federal law.Â  Rather, the\r\n  supremacy clause renders invalid any state legislation that frustrates the full\r\n  effectiveness of federal law.&quot;); Krentz v. Consol. Rail Corp.,&nbsp;910\r\n  A.2d 20, 34 (Pa. 2006) (&quot;[I]t is the effect of the state law that\r\n  matters in determining preemption, not its intent or\r\n  purpose.&quot; (quoting Teper v. Miller, 82 F.3d 989, 995 (11th Cir.\r\n  1996) (alteration in original)); cf. Pace v. CSX Transp., Inc.,\r\n  613 F.3d 1066 (11th Cir. 2010) (holding Georgia property owners' nuisance claim\r\n  against CSX for noise and smoke from increased traffic caused by adding a side\r\n  track near their property was preempted by the ICCTA; although the owners\r\n  argued they did not seek a remedy that would impact CSX's operations, the\r\n  Eleventh Circuit held any kind of remedy was preempted by the ICCTA,\r\n  which expressly covered side tracks).Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  although the aesthetic appearance of bridges is not specifically covered in the\r\n  ICCTA, the challenged provision need not be in direct conflict with the ICCTA\r\n  for preemption to apply.Â  See, e.g., Anderson v. BNSF Ry. Co., 291\r\n  S.W.3d 586, 592&nbsp;(Ark. 2009) (holding although the ICCTA did not expressly\r\n  mention railroad crossings, the jurisdiction of the ICCTA was exclusive over anything\r\n  having an economic impact on the railroad and thus was preempted by the act\r\n  (citing Franks Inv. Co. v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 534 F.3d 443 (5th Cir.\r\n  2008))).\r\nThe\r\n  purpose of the ICCTA is to prevent the development of a patchwork of local and\r\n  state regulations affecting the railroad industry, as the enactment of\r\n  differing standards and requirements would inevitably be detrimental to the orderly functioning of the\r\n  industry as a whole.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Federal Railroad Administration has recently adopted Bridge Safety Standards,\r\n  75 F.R. 41282-01 (July 15, 2010) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pts. 213 &amp;\r\n  237); currently available at 2010 WL 2771218.Â  It is noted therein that\r\n  &quot;[t]here are nearly 100,000 railroad bridges in the United States&quot;\r\n  and &quot;[t]hese bridges are owned by over 600 different entities.&quot;Â  The\r\n  standards were not in effect at the time this action arose, but they indicate\r\n  the intent that federal law govern the maintenance and condition of railroad\r\n  bridges.Â  The need for uniformity is readily apparent based on the number of\r\n  bridges throughout the United States and the diversity of ownership.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the City's public nuisance ordinance is ostensibly directed to aesthetic issues, its enforcement against Norfolk does\r\n  have an impact on its operations since railroad bridges and trestles are, by\r\n  federal law, considered part of the operations of the industry.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  affirm the circuit court's determination that the ICCTA preempts enforcement of\r\n  the City's ordinance against Norfolk.\r\nConclusionÂ  \r\n \r\nWe\r\n  conclude the circuit court properly determined the ICCTA preempts enforcement\r\n  of the City's public nuisance ordinance against Norfolk and affirm on this\r\n  basis.Â  Consequently, we need not reach the remaining issues presented on\r\n  appeal.[3]\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice Howard P. King, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The Bridge is referred to as &quot;Bridge R 111.6&quot;\r\n  in court documents. \r\n[2]Â  Section 28-261 declares public nuisances unlawful:Â \r\n  &quot;No person or entity shall create any nuisance or public nuisance in the\r\n  city, and no person shall by action or inaction allow or permit a nuisance or\r\n  public nuisance to occur or continue on any property which he owns, manages,\r\n  leases, controls, possesses or occupies.&quot;Â  Cayce, SC, Code Â§&nbsp;28&#8209;261. \r\n[3]Â  Because we find the ordinance is preempted based on\r\n  the ICCTA, we need not consider the additional basis for preemption found by\r\n  the circuit court under the FRSA.Â  Cf. City of Seattle v. Burlington\r\n    N. R.R. Co., 22 P.3d 260, 263 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001) (remarking\r\n  consideration of whether an ordinance was additionally preempted under the FSRA\r\n  was &quot;not necessary&quot; after finding it was already preempted by the&nbsp; ICCTA).Â  None of the remaining issues asserted by the City were ruled upon below\r\n  and, therefore, were not preserved for appeal.Â  See Ulmer v. Ulmer,&nbsp;369\r\n  S.C. 486, 490, 632 S.E.2d 858, 861&nbsp;(2006) (&quot;An appellate court will\r\n  not consider issues on appeal which have not been preserved for appellate\r\n  review.&quot;).Â  Having ruled on the merits of the circuit court's order, it is\r\n  unnecessary to entertain Norfolk's argument regarding an additional sustaining\r\n  ground.Â  See I'On, L.L.C. v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tSenior\r\n  Appellate Defender Joseph L. Savitz, III, of South Carolina Commission on\r\n  Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â Â Â Â Â  David\r\n  Dwight Smith shot and killed Robert Finley in a failed drug deal.Â  The trial\r\n  court charged the jury on the law of murder and self-defense, but refused to\r\n  charge voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, or accident. The jury\r\n  convicted Smith of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of\r\n  a violent crime.[1]Â \r\n  The court of appeals held Smith was entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge\r\n  and reversed his convictions.Â  The court of appeals declined to address whether\r\n  Smith was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter or accident charge.Â  We\r\n  granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  We reverse and\r\n  reinstate Smith's convictions and sentence. \r\nI.\r\nIn the early morning hours of January 12, 1997, Robert Finley (Victim) called Angie\r\n  Smith's home looking for crack cocaine.Â  Angie\r\n  contacted David Dwight Smith, a known drug dealer.Â  Angie knew Smith and knew\r\n  Smith had previously sold crack cocaine to Victim.Â  Victim owed Smith $40 from\r\n  their most recent drug transaction. \r\nWhen Smith and Angie arrived at the trailer, Smith sent Angie inside\r\n  to facilitate the drug deal.Â  Angie returned to the car and informed Smith that\r\n  Victim wanted to deal directly with Smith.Â  Smith grabbed a gun from under the\r\n  seat, exited the car, and entered the trailer.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Angie estimated Smith was inside for approximately two minutes.Â  The\r\n  trailer door opened, and Angie saw Smith and Victim engaged in a scuffle and\r\n  &quot;falling out the door.&quot;Â  Angie testified she heard a pop and saw\r\n  Victim's body fall to the ground.Â  Smith then got into the car and told her\r\n  &quot;you don't know nothing, you don't see nothing,&quot; and they drove away.\r\n\r\nSmithâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding the events leading up to his arrival at the trailer\r\n  mirrored Angie's.Â  Regarding the encounter with Victim inside the trailer,\r\n  Smith testified as follows:Â  Victim wanted $50 worth of crack cocaine.Â  Smith\r\n  placed the drugs on the counter for inspection.Â  Victim informed Smith he had\r\n  no money, but he would pay him the next day.Â  Smith refused to again give\r\n  Victim drugs on credit.Â  Victim responded that he was taking the drugs anyway\r\n  and approached Smith with a &quot;real serious demeanor.&quot;Â  At this point, Smith\r\n  pulled his gun and pointed it at Victim, who was unarmed.Â  Victim continued to approach Smith, stating &quot;what\r\n  are you gonna do, shoot me, give me the gun, I'll shoot myself.&quot;Â  Victim\r\n  grabbed Smith, trying to knock the gun out of Smithâ€™s hand.Â  Smith struck\r\n  Victim in the face with the gun.Â  As the two men were struggling near the\r\n  entrance to trailer, the &quot;the gun went off.&quot;\r\nII.Â  \r\nThe trial court\r\n  charged the jury on the law of murder and self-defense.Â  The trial court\r\n  refused to charge voluntary manslaughter because it found no evidence of\r\n  sufficient legal provocation.Â  The trial court refused to charge accident and\r\n  involuntary manslaughter because it found there was no evidence Smith was\r\n  acting lawfully.Â  The court of appeals held the trial court erred in failing to\r\n  give a voluntary manslaughter charge and reversed his convictions.Â  We granted\r\n  the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  \r\nThe law to be charged to the jury is to be determined by the\r\n  evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 364, 380\r\n  S.E.2d 834, 835 (1989).Â  If there is any evidence to warrant a jury\r\n  instruction, a trial court must, upon request, give the instruction.Â  State\r\n    v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 632, 545 S.E.2d 805, 819 (2001).Â  A trial court\r\n  commits reversible error when it fails to give a requested charge on an issue\r\n  raised by the evidence presented.Â  Lee, 298 S.C. at 364, 380 S.E.2d at\r\n  835. Â \r\n\r\nIII.\r\na.&nbsp; Voluntary Manslaughter\r\nThe trial court properly refused Smithâ€™s request for a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge.Â  Voluntary manslaughter is the intentional and unlawful\r\n  killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal\r\n  provocation.Â  State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 572, 647 S.E.2d 144, 167 (2007).Â  The sudden heat of\r\n  passion, upon sufficient legal provocation, while it need not dethrone reason\r\n  entirely, or shut out knowledge and volition, must be such as would naturally\r\n  disturb the sway of reason, render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of\r\n  cool reflection, and produce what, according to human experience, may be called\r\n  an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  Id. at 572, 647 S.E.2d\r\n  at 167.Â  In determining whether\r\n  the act which caused death was impelled by heat of passion or by malice, all\r\n  the surrounding circumstances and conditions are to be taken into\r\n  consideration, including previous relations and conditions connected with the\r\n  tragedy, as well as those existing at the time of the killing.Â  State\r\n    v. Norris, 253 S.C. 31, 35 168 S.E.2d 564, 566 (1969); State v. Gardner,\r\n  219 S.C. 97, 105, 64 S.E.2d 130, 134 (1951).Â  &quot;To warrant the court in eliminating the offense of\r\n  manslaughter it should clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever\r\n  tending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.&quot;Â  Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. at 572, 647 S.E.2d at 168.\r\nWe recognize an overt,\r\n  threatening act or physical encounter may constitute sufficient legal\r\n  provocation.Â  See id. at 573, 647 S.E.2d at 168, (citing Gardner, 219 S.C. at 105, 64 S.E.2d at 134) (observing that &quot;[t]his Court has\r\n  previously held that an overt, threatening act or a physical encounter may\r\n  constitute sufficient legal provocation.&quot;).Â  While Smith's assertion of\r\n  legal provocation is dubious at best, the record is devoid of any evidence of\r\n  heat of passion.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  a defendant to be entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge, there must be\r\n  evidence of both sufficient legal provocation and heat of passion at the time\r\n  of the killing.Â  See State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511,\r\n  513 (2000) (&quot;Both heat of passion and sufficient\r\n  legal provocation must be present at the time of the killing.â€).Â \r\n  According to Smith, he was not enraged, incapable of\r\n  &quot;cool reflection,&quot; or acting &quot;under an uncontrollable impulse to\r\n  do violence.&quot;Â  Because of the absence of any evidence of heat of passion,\r\n  the trial court properly declined the voluntary manslaughter charge.[2]Â \r\n  We reverse the court of appeals on this issue.\r\nb.&nbsp; Involuntary Manslaughter\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is: (1) the unintentional killing of\r\n  another without malice, but while engaged in an unlawful activity not amounting\r\n  to a felony and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or\r\n  (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless\r\n  disregard for the safety of others.Â  State\r\n    v. Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 380-81,\r\n  605 S.E.2d 522, 526 (2004). \r\nSmith contends he was entitled to a charge\r\n  under the second definition of involuntary manslaughter because the evidence\r\n  would support a finding that he was lawfully armed in self-defense at the time\r\n  the fatal shot occurred.Â  We find no such evidence.\r\nSmith\r\n  entered the trailer to sell crack cocaine, a felony, to Victim.Â  Smith pursued\r\n  the drug deal while armed with a loaded gun, knowing Victim owed him $40 from a\r\n  previous drug transaction.Â  During the confrontation, Smith brandished the gun\r\n  and used it to pistol-whip Victim.Â  According to Smith, he pistol-whipped\r\n  Victim because Victim was approaching him in a &quot;real serious\r\n  demeanor.&quot;Â  Victim was unarmed, the door to Victim's trailer was unlocked,\r\n  and there is no evidence Smith was unable to retreat from the dangerous\r\n  situation he created.Â  Based on these facts, we find no evidence to support Smith's\r\n  assertion that he was acting lawfully by arming himself in self-defense.Â \r\n  Specifically, there is no evidence to suggest that Smith was without fault in\r\n  bringing on the difficulty, that he believed or actually was in imminent danger\r\n  of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or that he &quot;had no\r\n  other probable means of avoiding the danger&quot; other than drawing the loaded\r\n  weapon.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly refused the involuntary\r\n  manslaughter instruction. \r\nc.&nbsp; Accident\r\nFor a homicide to be excusable on the ground of accident, it must\r\n  be shown the killing was unintentional, the defendant was acting lawfully, and\r\n  due care was exercised in the handling of the weapon.Â  State v. Burriss, 334\r\n  S.C. 256, 259, 513 S.E.2d 104, 106 (1999).Â  Because Smith was\r\n  acting unlawfully, he was not entitled to an accident charge.[3]Â  \r\nIV.\r\nWe reverse the\r\n  court of appeals' determination that Smith was entitled to a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge.Â  We further hold Smith was entitled to neither an\r\n  involuntary manslaughter charge nor an accident charge.Â  In reversing the court\r\n  of appeals, we reinstate Smith's convictions and sentence.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; This was Smith's second trial on the charges.Â  The\r\n  convictions and sentences from his first trial were vacated on post-conviction\r\n  relief.\r\n[2]&nbsp; The trial court correctly observed that there\r\n  was no evidence of self-defense, observing, &quot;I just donâ€™t see how in the\r\n  world that the evidence can be construed that [Smith] was without fault in\r\n  bringing on the difficulty, and how he was in imminent danger of losing his\r\n  life or sustaining serious bodily injury.&quot;Â  It is not entirely clear why\r\n  self-defense was charged.Â  It appears that the State focused its objections to\r\n  the requests for charges on voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter\r\n  and accident.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Moreover, there is no evidence Smith exercised\r\n  due care in the handling of the gun.Â  See\r\n    State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 51 n.2,\r\n  584 S.E.2d 110, 112 n.2 (2003) (&quot;To\r\n  satisfy the legal defense of accident, it must be shown that the defendant used\r\n  due care in the handling of the weapon.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26927","title":"State v.

Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In\r\n  this case, Ronald J. Sheppard, the former CEO of HomeGold Financial, Inc.\r\n  (HomeGold), was charged with securities fraud, obtaining property under false\r\n  pretenses, and conspiracy.Â  He was found guilty on all three charges and sentenced\r\n  to a total of twenty years imprisonment.Â  Sheppard appeals, seeking either to\r\n  have his convictions vacated, or to have his sentences vacated and remanded for\r\n  resentencing, arguing: (1) he was denied a fair trial because of a third\r\n  party's contact with a juror; (2) the state grand jury lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction over the counts of obtaining property under false pretenses and\r\n  conspiracy; (3) section 14-7-1820 of the South Carolina Code violates the\r\n  constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws; and (4) the circuit\r\n  court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence disproportionate to those of\r\n  his co-conspirators. \r\nFacts/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nThis case stems\r\n  from the financial collapse and ultimate bankruptcy of HomeGold, a financial\r\n  services company heavily involved with subprime mortgages.Â  Carolina Investors,\r\n  Inc. originally financed the sale of cemetery plots, but later expanded into\r\n  other lending.Â  Carolina Investors was ultimately purchased by another company,\r\n  which took over Carolina Investors' lending operations.Â  Carolina Investors\r\n  continued to sell debt instruments, but the money it raised went to fund the\r\n  operation of its parent company, primarily through a series of intercompany\r\n  loans.Â  In 1998, the parent company began losing money, became a publicly\r\n  traded company, and changed its name to HomeGold Financial, Inc.Â  HomeGold\r\n  began losing hundreds of millions of dollars and its indebtedness to Carolina\r\n  Investors continued to grow.Â  In an effort to stabilize the company, HomeGold\r\n  merged with HomeSense, Sheppard's subprime mortgage lending business, and\r\n  Sheppard became its CEO.Â  After several years of financially abusing the\r\n  company, Sheppard resigned his position with HomeGold to create a new company\r\n  to buy HomeGold's mortgage business.Â  Shortly thereafter, HomeGold filed for\r\n  bankruptcy.Â Â  \r\nIn November 2005, a\r\n  state grand jury indicted Sheppard on eleven charges stemming from his\r\n  involvement with the mishandling of HomeGold's business and financial\r\n  operations.Â  The circuit court granted Sheppard's motion to dismiss eight of\r\n  the eleven charges.Â  Sheppard was found guilty and sentenced for the three\r\n  remaining charges, with the sentences to run consecutively: (1) securities\r\n  violation, ten years; (2) obtaining property by false pretenses, five years;\r\n  and (3) conspiracy, five years.Â  \r\nIssues\r\nSheppard\r\n  presents the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tWas Sheppard deprived of his constitutional right \r\n\t\t\tto a fair trial before an impartial jury when a spectator made \r\n\t\t\tcontact with a juror in an elevator?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the state grand jury have subject matter \r\n\t\t\tjurisdiction over the counts of obtaining property by false \r\n\t\t\tpretenses and conspiracy?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.\r\n\t\t\tDoes section 14-7-1820 of the South Carolina Code \r\n\t\t\tviolate the constitutional prohibitions against the passage of ex post facto laws?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court abuse its discretion by \r\n\t\t\timposing a sentence on Sheppard that was substantially greater than \r\n\t\t\tthe sentences of the co-conspirators?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn criminal cases,\r\n  the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus,\r\n  367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  The conduct of a criminal\r\n  trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who will not\r\n  be reversed in the absence of a prejudicial abuse of discretion.Â  State v.\r\n    Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212&nbsp;(1982). Â  Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Contact with Juror\r\nSheppard\r\n  argues that a spectator's contact with a juror deprived him of a fair and\r\n  impartial trial because the circuit court judge failed to cure the resulting\r\n  prejudice.Â  We disagree.\r\nSheppard\r\n  invokes the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution\r\n  in his conclusory argument that he was denied a fair trial by a spectator's\r\n  comment to a juror in an elevator, and by the circuit court judge's failure to\r\n  remedy any resulting prejudice.Â  The comment itself is not in the record, and\r\n  the only information about the comment is found when the circuit court judge\r\n  addresses the jury:\r\n\r\n\tMadam\r\n  Forelady and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, hope you had a good weekend.Â \r\n  For the juror who reported an inappropriate comment on the elevator on\r\n  Thursday, I appreciate that, I will deal with that and thank you for making\r\n  that report. \r\n\r\nSheppard contends the judge\r\n  was required to ensure Sheppard received a fair and impartial trial by\r\n  interviewing the juror to ascertain the extent of any potential prejudice and\r\n  by giving the entire jury a curative instruction, even in the absence of any\r\n  objection or motion by defense counsel.Â  He argues not only that the circuit\r\n  court was required to address the issue without motion or objection, but also\r\n  that this Court may reach the unpreserved issue because the issue is\r\n  &quot;absolutely essential to a fair trial&quot; and resolving the question now\r\n  is in the interest of judicial economy.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  Sheppard has not properly preserved this issue for appellate review.Â  After the\r\n  judge addressed the jury regarding the comment, Sheppard made no motion or\r\n  objection; instead, he immediately began cross-examining a witness.Â  Our law is\r\n  clear that a party must make a contemporaneous objection that is ruled upon by\r\n  the trial judge to preserve an issue for appellate review. Â State v. Johnson,\r\n  363 S.C. 53, 58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005).Â  This rule also applies to\r\n  constitutional arguments.Â  See State v. Owens, 378 S.C. 636, 638, 664\r\n  S.E.2d 80, 81 (2008) (finding constitutional claims not preserved for review\r\n  without a contemporaneous objection at trial).\r\nSecond,\r\n  aside from the preservation problem, Sheppard is clearly arguing for this Court\r\n  to apply the plain error rule.Â  While Sheppard does not use the phrase\r\n  &quot;plain error,&quot; he states that the circuit court judge had the\r\n  obligation to investigate and cure any potential prejudice even without\r\n  objection or motion from defense counsel.Â  This Court, however, has routinely\r\n  held the plain error rule does not apply in South Carolina state courts.Â  See\r\n    Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 306, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997)\r\n  (recognizing South Carolina appellate courts have consistently refused to apply\r\n  the plain error rule).Â  Instead, a party must have a contemporaneous and\r\n  specific objection to preserve an issue for appellate review.Â  Johnson,\r\n  363 S.C. at 58, 609 S.E.2d at 523.Â  Thus, Sheppard's argument that a judge\r\n  commits an abuse of discretion by not ex mero motu[1] addressing an issue at trial is not supported by our\r\n  case law.Â  Therefore, because Sheppard has not preserved this issue for review\r\n  and because this Court does not apply the plain error rule, his argument fails.\r\nII.&nbsp; State Grand Jury's\r\n  Indictment\r\nSheppard\r\n  argues the state grand jury did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the\r\n  counts of obtaining property under false pretenses and conspiracy, and\r\n  therefore his convictions should be vacated.Â  We disagree.\r\nSheppard\r\n  cloaks his argument as subject matter jurisdiction, but he is actually\r\n  challenging the sufficiency of the indictment when he argues the state grand\r\n  jury did not have jurisdiction over the counts of obtaining property under\r\n  false pretenses and conspiracy.Â  He contends section 14-7-1630 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code does not specifically include these charges, and that these\r\n  charges are not related to the securities violations that are expressly\r\n  included in the grand jury's jurisdiction.Â  For this reason, he argues, he\r\n  could not have been properly charged with these crimes, and the circuit court\r\n  consequently lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict him.\r\nCertainly,\r\n  issues relating to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.Â  State\r\n    v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 498 (2005).Â  In Gentry,\r\n  this Court clarified that a court's subject matter jurisdiction is that court's\r\n  power &quot;to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the\r\n  proceedings in question belong.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Further, the sufficiency of\r\n  an indictment is a question separate from and does not implicate subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499.Â  Thus, this Court held\r\n  that if an indictment is challenged as insufficient or defective, that\r\n  challenge must be raised before the jury is sworn.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  there is no question that the circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  over the crimes charged.Â  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11 (&quot;The\r\n  Circuit Court shall be a general trial court with original jurisdiction in\r\n  civil and criminal cases . . . .&quot;)Â  Despite Sheppard's phrasing and\r\n  denial, he is challenging the sufficiency of the indictment when he claims the\r\n  state grand jury could not consider the counts of obtaining property under\r\n  false pretenses and conspiracy.Â  As explained in Gentry, any challenge\r\n  to the sufficiency of the indictment must be made before the jury is sworn.Â  Id. at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499.Â  While Sheppard did timely file a motion to quash\r\n  the indictment, he only challenged eight of the eleven counts, conceding the\r\n  counts upon which he was ultimately convicted were within the limited subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction of the state grand jury.Â  Therefore, Sheppard\r\n  mischaracterizes his argument as one of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Further,\r\n  because he failed to timely challenge these counts in the indictment and\r\n  instead went to trial on the charges, he cannot now, having lost at trial, come\r\n  back to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment.Â  See Gentry, 363\r\n  S.C. at 102, 610 S.E.2d at 499-500 (quoting State v. Faile, 43 S.C. 52,\r\n  59-60, 20 S.E. 798, 801 (1895)).\r\nFurther,\r\n  we disagree with the substance of Sheppard's argument that the statute granting\r\n  the state grand jury authority over securities violations does not encompass\r\n  the crimes of obtaining property by false pretenses and conspiracy.Â  While the\r\n  statute establishing the jurisdiction of the state grand jury plainly evidences\r\n  the General Assembly's intent to limit said jurisdiction, we do not believe it\r\n  intended to hinder the grand jury's ability to investigate and indict for crimes\r\n  committed in the course of conduct of an enumerated crime.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1630 (Supp. 2009).Â  Subsection 7 of the statute grants\r\n  jurisdiction to the state grand jury over &quot;a crime involving a violation\r\n  of Chapter 1, Title 35 of the Uniform Securities Act, or a crime related to\r\n  securities fraud or a violation of the securities laws.&quot;Â  Id. Â§\r\n  14-7-1630(7).Â  We find the language &quot;or a crime related to&quot; is broad\r\n  enough to encompass those crimes committed in the same course of conduct as an\r\n  enumerated crime.Â  Thus, the state grand jury has jurisdiction over the charges\r\n  of obtaining property by false pretenses and conspiracy, even though those\r\n  specific crimes may not be enumerated elsewhere in section 14-7-1630, because\r\n  they were committed in the same course of conduct as the securities violations.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Section 14-7-1820 and the Ex\r\n  Post Facto prohibition\r\nSheppard\r\n  argues section 14-7-1820 of the South Carolina Code is an unconstitutional ex\r\n  post facto law.Â  However, Sheppard has not preserved this issue for appellate\r\n  review.Â  It appears from the record this argument is being made for the first\r\n  time on appeal.Â  Our law is clear than an issue may not be raised for the first\r\n  time on appeal.Â  See I'on LLC v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n  422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).\r\nSection\r\n  14-7-1820 states, in its entirety, &quot;This article applies to offenses\r\n  committed both before and after its effective date.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  14-7-1820 (Supp. 2009).Â  Sheppard argues this section violates the\r\n  constitutional prohibitions against the passage of ex post facto laws because\r\n  section 14-7-1630 of the South Carolina Code, the section that describes the\r\n  jurisdiction of the state grand jury, did not include jurisdiction over\r\n  securities violations until it was amended in 2003 in response to the HomeGold\r\n  financial disaster.Â  Sheppard argues that because the amendment was an ex post\r\n  facto law, it is unconstitutional and that section of the statute is void.Â \r\n  Therefore, he argues, because that unconstitutional section was the only grant\r\n  of authority to the state grand jury over securities violations, the state\r\n  grand jury did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the counts in the\r\n  indictment, and his convictions should be vacated.Â  This argument, however, is again\r\n  a thinly veiled attempt to reach subject matter jurisdiction because Sheppard\r\n  has not preserved his ex post facto argument for appellate review.Â  See\r\n    Gentry, 363 at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499 (a challenge to the indictment must\r\n  be made before the jury is sworn).\r\nIV.&nbsp; Disproportionate Sentence\r\nSheppard\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in sentencing him to twenty years total\r\n  imprisonment because his sentence was disproportionately greater than those of\r\n  his co-conspirators.Â  This argument, however, was not raised to the trial\r\n  judge; therefore, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See\r\n    State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999) (&quot;[T]his\r\n  Court has consistently held that a challenge to sentencing must be raised at trial,\r\n  or the issue will not be preserved for appellate review.&quot;) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Ex mero motu is a synonym for sua sponte.Â  State v.

King, of Willcox, Buyck &amp; Williams, of Florence, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tDwight\r\n  Christopher Moore, of Moore Law Firm, of Sumter, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Maurice\r\n  and Marquise Stinney were expelled from Sumter High School for being involved\r\n  in a fight with other students.Â  After appealing the expulsions up to the Board\r\n  of Trustees (the Board), Joseph and Cynthia Stinney (the Stinneys), Maurice's\r\n  and Marquise's parents, filed a suit in circuit court against Sumter School\r\n  District 17 (the District) for violating Maurice's and Marquise's due process\r\n  rights, among other claims.Â  The circuit court granted the District's motion\r\n  for summary judgment on the due process claim, finding the Stinneys failed to\r\n  exhaust their administrative remedies.Â  The court of appeals reversed, and this\r\n  Court granted the District's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nIn\r\n  September 2003, Maurice and Marquise Stinney were expelled from Sumter High\r\n  School for their involvement in a fight with two other students.Â  The District\r\n  superintendent and the Board both upheld the expulsions upon appeal, in October\r\n  2003 and November 2003, respectively.Â  Maurice and Marquise had the right to\r\n  appeal the Board's decision to the circuit court but they did not.Â  \r\nNearly\r\n  two years later, the Stinneys brought a suit against the District in circuit\r\n  court, alleging, among other causes of action, the District's actions or\r\n  inactions regarding the expulsions violated Maurice's and Marquise's due\r\n  process rights.Â  The circuit court granted the District's motion for summary\r\n  judgment as to the due process claim because the Stinneys failed to exhaust\r\n  their administrative remedies by not appealing to the circuit court.Â  The court\r\n  of appeals reversed, holding the Stinneys had exhausted their administrative\r\n  remedies.Â  Stinney v. Sumter School District 17, 382 S.C. 352, 359-60,\r\n  67 S.E.2d 760, 764 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  This Court granted a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review that decision.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nSummary judgment is\r\n  appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear\r\n  that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose,\r\n  350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002). Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAnalysis\r\nThe\r\n  District argues the court of appeals erred in failing to affirm summary\r\n  judgment as to the due process claim.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court granted summary judgment on the Stinneys' due process claim\r\n  because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as to that claim.Â \r\n  This was legal error.[1]Â \r\n  Regardless, we find that the Stinneys were afforded all process that was\r\n  constitutionally due and affirm the grant of summary judgment.\r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court has said the fundamental touchstone of due process\r\n  is the opportunity to be heard.Â  Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 579, 95 S.\r\n  Ct. 728, 739 (1975).Â  The Supreme Court further stated that the type of hearing\r\n  required to be provided will depend upon the nature of the case.Â  Id. at\r\n  579, 95 S. Ct. at 738.Â  For example, in Goss, the Supreme Court held a\r\n  public school student facing a short-term suspension need only be provided with\r\n  notice of the claims against him and an opportunity to explain his side of the\r\n  facts, and was not constitutionally guaranteed a full adversarial hearing.Â  Id. at 581, 95 S. Ct. at 740.Â  \r\nExpulsion\r\n  is a more serious disciplinary action than is suspension.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  procedures and protections given to the accused student should be greater than\r\n  the informal, immediate hearing that was authorized in Goss.Â  \r\nWithout\r\n  deciding the constitutional minimum that must be given in these circumstances,\r\n  we find those procedures and protections outlined in section 59-63-240 to be\r\n  constitutionally sufficient.Â  The statute reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tIf\r\n  procedures for expulsion are initiated, the parents or legal guardian of the\r\n  pupil shall be notified in writing of the time and the place of a hearing\r\n  either before the board or a person or committee designated by the board. At\r\n  the hearing the parents or legal guardian shall have the right to legal counsel\r\n  and to all other regular legal rights including the right to question all\r\n  witnesses. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-63-240 (2004).Â \r\n  This statute affords notice, the opportunity to be heard, the right to be\r\n  represented by counsel, and the right to present evidence and question\r\n  witnesses.Â  The record shows the Stinneys were provided with the process\r\n  established in the statute.Â  The Stinneys chose not to be represented by\r\n  counsel during the initial hearing, and the fact that they did not present\r\n  evidence or exercise their statutory right to question witnesses does not\r\n  create a procedural due process violation.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis\r\n  Court can affirm for any reason appearing in the record.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR; I'on\r\n    L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722\r\n  (2000).Â  Accordingly, we hold the Stinneys were provided with due process, and\r\n  we reverse the court of appeals and affirm the circuit court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment as to the Stinneys' due process claim.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice Dorothy Mobley Jones, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Both the circuit court and the court of appeals erred in applying the doctrine\r\n  of exhaustion of administrative remedies in this case.Â  The doctrine of\r\n  exhaustion of administrative remedies only applies when a litigant invokes the\r\n  original jurisdiction of the circuit court to adjudicate a claim based upon a\r\n  statutory violation for which the legislature has provided an administrative\r\n  remedy.Â  Thomas Sand Co. v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 349 S.C. 402, 563\r\n  S.E.2d 109 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When an administrative remedy is not available for\r\n  the injury suffered, the doctrine of exhaustion is not applicable.Â  Id.Â  Here,\r\n  the claim before the Board was an appeal of the expulsionsâ€”the Stinneys were\r\n  seeking to have the expulsions reversed.Â  The Stinneys did not appeal the\r\n  Board's decision upholding the expulsions to the circuit court.Â  Instead, they\r\n  initiated a new suit in the circuit court seeking damages and alleging\r\n  negligence, violations of due process, and failure to follow disciplinary procedures.Â \r\n  This new suit was a tort claim, not a statutory violation for which the\r\n  legislature has provided an administrative remedy.Â  For that reason, exhaustion\r\n  simply is inapplicable to the new suit.Â  This conclusion does not indicate that\r\n  any litigant in an administrative process can bring a tort suit to collaterally\r\n  attack the findings of the administrative bodies.Â  Res judicata still applies\r\n  in the administrative setting, and such determinations may bar subsequent\r\n  litigation.Â  See Earle v. Aycock, 276 S.C. 471, 475, 279 S.E.2d 614, 616\r\n  (1981) (administrative decision can have preclusive effect in collateral\r\n  litigation).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26929","title":"EllisDon Construction v.

Patrick Smith, both of Harper, Lambert &amp; Brown, of Greenville,\r\n  for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tChristian\r\n  M. Emanuel, of Columbia; James W. Logan, Jr. and Stacey Todd Coffee, both of Logan,\r\n  Jolly &amp; Smith, of Anderson; Keith C. McCook, Frank S. Potts, and Edwin E.\r\n  Evans, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this case, EllisDon Construction (Appellant) appeals the\r\n  decision of the circuit court that held Appellant was not entitled to interest\r\n  under section 34-31-20 of the South Carolina Code (1987 &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  We\r\n  affirm.Â  \r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nAppellant,\r\n  a general contractor, had contracted with Clemson University (Clemson) to\r\n  construct a new science complex on Clemson's campus.Â  The contract stated that\r\n  Clemson would pay interest to Appellant in accordance with the Prompt Payment\r\n  Act found at section 29-6-50 of the South Carolina Code (2007).Â  This section\r\n  reads, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\tIf a periodic or final payment to a contractor is delayed by more\r\n  than twenty-one days . . . the owner, contractor, or subcontractor shall pay\r\n  his contractor or subcontractor interest, beginning on the due date, at the\r\n  rate of one percent a month or a pro rata fraction thereof on the unpaid\r\n  balance as may be due. However, no interest is due unless the person being\r\n  charged interest has been notified of the provisions of this section at the\r\n  time request for payment is made. \r\n\r\nClemson withheld a portion of the payment for the project,\r\n  claiming Appellant had materially failed to perform its contractual\r\n  obligations.Â  After failed mediation attempts, the Chief Procurement Officer\r\n  found that Appellant failed to meet the requirement for receiving an award of\r\n  interest under section 29-6-50 because it failed to provide Clemson notice of\r\n  the statute when it requested payment.Â  The Procurement Review Panel (Panel)\r\n  reasoned that although Appellant failed to meet the notice requirement of\r\n  section 29-6-50, it would be inequitable to hold that EllisDon could not\r\n  collect prejudgment interest.Â  Thus, the Panel held Appellant was entitled to\r\n  interest under the general interest statute found at section 34-31-20(A) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code.[1]Â \r\n  The circuit court reversed the Panel, finding that Appellant had not met the\r\n  requirements of section 29-6-50, and that section 34-31-20(A) only applies in\r\n  the absence of a contractually agreed upon interest provision.Â  Appellant\r\n  appealed to the court of appeals, and this Court certified the case pursuant to\r\n  Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act governs the\r\n  judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380 (Supp. 2008). Â An appellate court may reverse the decision of an\r\n  administrative agency if it is affected by an error of law.Â  Id. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(5).\r\nAnalysis\r\nAppellant argues that the circuit court erred in holding South\r\n  Carolina's general interest statute was not applicable to the contract in\r\n  question.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe circuit court found section 29-6-50, incorporated into the\r\n  contract in this case, is properly applicable to the contract.Â  The circuit\r\n  court also found that Appellant failed to satisfy the notice requirements under\r\n  that statute, and therefore is not entitled to interest under section 29-6-50.Â \r\n  Appellant does not challenge that finding on appeal; therefore, the only\r\n  question is whether section 34-31-20(A), the general interest statute, also applies\r\n  in this case.Â  Appellant argues the general interest statute applies to all\r\n  cases where any sum of money is due and owing, and that this statute is not\r\n  superseded by section 29-6-50.Â  The circuit court, however, relying on Sears\r\n    v. Fowler, 293 S.C. 43, 358 S.E.2d 574 (1987), found the general interest\r\n  statute only applies when an interest rate has not been agreed to in the\r\n  contract.Â  In Sears v. Fowler, this Court stated that the general\r\n  interest statute does not apply when the parties have contracted for a\r\n  different interest rate.Â  293 S.C. at 45, 358 S.E.2d at 575 (citing Turner\r\n    Coleman, Inc. v. Ohio Const. &amp; Eng'g, Inc., 272 S.C. 289, 251\r\n  S.E.2d 738 (1979)).Â  Appellant, however, argues that reliance upon Turner\r\n    Coleman is misplaced because in that case the contract noted a particular\r\n  interest rate, and in this case the contract incorporated a statute that\r\n  determines the interest rate.Â  That is a distinction without a difference, and Sears\r\n    v. Fowler and Turner Coleman are controlling in the instant case.Â \r\n  Therefore, Appellant is not entitled to interest under section 34-31-20(A)\r\n  because it contracted for a different rate of interest.\r\nFurther, the circuit court correctly found that the Panel\r\n  improperly awarded Appellant interest under the general interest statute\r\n  because the Panel felt it would be inequitable to do otherwise.Â  As the circuit\r\n  court explains, equity is only available when a party is without an adequate\r\n  remedy at law.Â  See Key Corp. Capital, Inc. v. County of Beaufort, 373\r\n  S.C. 55, 61, 644 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2007) (&quot;While equitable relief is\r\n  generally available where there is no adequate remedy at law, an adequate legal\r\n  remedy may be provided by statute.&quot;).Â  In this case, Appellant had a legal\r\n  remedy for collecting interestâ€” it needed only to meet the requirements of\r\n  section 29-6-50 to be entitled to interest.Â  A party failing to fulfill the\r\n  requirements of its legal remedy cannot later come to the courts complaining of\r\n  hardship, seeking an equitable remedy.Â Â  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nBecause the contract specified an interest amount, section 34-31-20(A)\r\n  does not apply.Â  Therefore, the circuit court did not err in reversing the\r\n  judgment of the Panel, and the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majority's decision to affirm the\r\n  circuit court's order, but write separately as I reach this result by a\r\n  different route.Â  \r\nWhile it is\r\n  certainly accurate to say that parties may contract for a different interest\r\n  rate than that provided by the prejudgment interest statute,[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20 (Supp. 2009), I do not find that rule applicable\r\n  here.Â  The parties' contract provides, in subparagraph 9.7.2, that Clemson\r\n  &quot;shall pay interest on delayed certified payments to [appellant] in\r\n  accordance with Section 29-6-50 of the SC Code of Laws.&quot;Â  While this\r\n  provision expressly incorporates the Prompt Payment Act into the contract, it\r\n  does not alter a statutorily-set interest rate.Â  Moreover, neither the Act nor\r\n  subparagraph 9.7.2 are applicable to this contract dispute, which does not\r\n  involve certified periodic or final payments, but rather arises from\r\n  appellant's successful claim that Clemson wrongfully withheld monies due under\r\n  the contract.\r\nI find, however,\r\n  that appellant is barred from recovering prejudgment interest by the doctrine\r\n  of sovereign immunity.Â  It is well-settled that the doctrine bars recovery of\r\n  interest against the State &quot;unless [the State has been] bound by an act of\r\n  the Legislature or by a lawful contract of its executive officers . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Monarch Mills v.

Neuschafer, all of Collins\r\n  &amp; Lacy, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  Respondent\r\n  brought this inverse condemnation action against South Carolina Department of\r\n  Transportation (SCDOT).Â  The master in equity granted summary judgment in favor\r\n  of respondent.Â  SCDOT appeals.Â  We\r\n  reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent owned a\r\n  tract of land located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Killian\r\n  Road (running east to west) and Farrow Road (running north to south).Â  A\r\n  railroad track owned by Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) runs\r\n  parallel to Farrow Road, adjacent to respondent's property.Â  Respondent never\r\n  had direct access to Farrow Road from its property.Â  Respondent directly\r\n  accessed Killian Road using a driveway to the right of the railroad track.\r\nIn\r\n  2006, Norfolk Southern entered an agreement with SCDOT whereby SCDOT closed the\r\n  portion of Killian Road that contained a railroad grade crossing near the\r\n  intersection of Farrow Road.[1]Â \r\n  After the road closing, respondent could no longer access Farrow Road by\r\n  turning left onto Killian road and crossing the Norfolk Southern tracks.Â  Instead,\r\n  respondent had to turn right onto Killian Road, then right onto Longtown Road,\r\n  and travel around the back of the property to the point where Longtown Road\r\n  intersects Farrow Road.\r\nRespondent\r\n  subsequently brought this inverse condemnation action seeking damages for the\r\n  lost value of its land that purportedly resulted from the taking of its access\r\n  rights to Farrow Road.Â  The master in equity granted summary judgment in favor\r\n  of respondent.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp; Did the master err in finding Hardin\r\n  v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 371 S.C. 598, 641 S.E.2d 437 (2007) does not\r\n  apply to this case?\r\n\tII.&nbsp; Did the master err in granting\r\n  summary judgment in favor of respondent?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Applicable Law\r\n&nbsp;SCDOT argues the master erred in finding Hardin should only apply prospectively.Â  We agree.\r\nPrior to the Court's decision in Hardin,\r\n  a landowner's ability to recover damages as a result of a re-configuration of\r\n  road access depended on the location of his land with reference to the road\r\n  vacated and the effect of the vacation on his rights as an abutting landowner.Â  See City of Rock Hill v. Cothran, 209 S.C. 357, 40 S.E.2d 239\r\n  (1946).Â  The Cothran Court held a landowner is not entitled to recover\r\n  damages unless he has sustained a &quot;special injury,&quot; which is an\r\n  injury different in kind and not merely in degree from that suffered by the\r\n  public at large.Â  Id at 368-69, 40 S.E.2d at 243-44.\r\nIn Hardin, the Court abandoned the\r\n  &quot;special injury&quot; analysis which previously existed in this state's\r\n  jurisprudence, and specified that the focus in these cases should be how any\r\n  road re-configuration affects a property owner's easements.Â  Hardin, 371\r\n  S.C. at 609, 641 S.E.2d at 443.\r\n&quot;The general rule regarding retroactive\r\n  application of judicial decisions is that decisions creating new substantive\r\n  rights have prospective effect only, whereas decisions creating new remedies to\r\n  vindicate existing rights are applied retrospectively.&quot;Â  Toth v. Square\r\n    D Co., 298 S.C. 6, 8, 377 S.E.2d 584, 585 (1989).Â  &quot;Prospective\r\n  application is required when liability is created where formerly none\r\n  existed.&quot;Â  Id.; See also Marcum v. Bowden, 372\r\n  S.C. 452, 643 S.E.2d 85 (2007) (the holding that an adult social host who\r\n  knowingly and intentionally serves an alcoholic beverage to a person between\r\n  the ages of 18 and 20 created tort liability where formerly there was none, and\r\n  thus, the Court's decision should be applied prospectively); Ludwick v. This\r\n    Minute of Carolina, 287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d 213 (1985) (employment law\r\n  case first recognizing the tort of retaliatory discharge, thereby creating a new cause of action and a new\r\n  substantive right); McCaskey v. Shaw, 295 S.C. 372, 368 S.E.2d 672 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1988) (the Court's recognition of a tort for the negligent infliction of\r\n  emotional distress created a new cause of action and should be applied\r\n  prospectively).\r\nWe find the master erred in concluding Hardin should only be applied prospectively.Â  At the outset, we note counsel for\r\n  respondent candidly agreed at oral argument that Hardin should apply\r\n  here.Â  We find Hardin created no new right or cause of action, but,\r\n  rather restated the focus in determining whether a road re-configuration\r\n  amounts to a taking.Â  Thus, Hardin applies retrospectively.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Summary Judgment\r\nSCDOT argues the\r\n  master in equity erred in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nWhen reviewing an\r\n  order granting summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard\r\n  as the trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law. Â Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into\r\n  the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  USAA\r\n    Property and Cas. Ins. Co. v. Clegg, 377 S.C. 643, 653, 661 S.E.2d 791, 796\r\n  (2008). Â In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court\r\n  must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Â Fleming,\r\n  350 S.C. at 493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nPrivate\r\n  property shall not be taken for public use without the payment of &quot;just\r\n  compensation.&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 13.Â  The elements of an action for\r\n  an inverse condemnation are:Â  (1) affirmative conduct of a government entity;\r\n  (2) the conduct effects a taking; and (3) the taking is for a public use.Â  Byrd\r\n    v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 657, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79 (2005).Â  A \r\nplaintiff's right to recovery in an inverse\r\n  condemnation case is premised upon the ability to show that he or she has suffered\r\n  a taking.Â  Hardin, 371 S.C. at 604, 641 S.E.2d at 441.A property owner in South Carolina has an\r\n  easement for access to and from any public road that abuts his property,\r\n  regardless whether he has additional access to and from another public road.Â  Hardin,\r\n  371 S.C. at 606, 641 S.E.2d at 442.Â  A property owner also has an easement for\r\n  access to and from the public road system.Â  Id.Â  In cases addressing\r\n  road re-configuration, the focus must be on a landowner's actual property\r\n  interests; that is, his easements.Â  Hardin, 371 S.C. at 609, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  at 443.Â  \r\nAs explained above, the master in equity\r\n  erred in finding Hardin does not apply to this case.Â  The master,\r\n  however, went on to state respondent would prevail even under Hardin.Â \r\n  Specifically, the master found the railroad track did not destroy the\r\n  contiguity of respondent's property for purposes of determining whether the\r\n  property abuts Farrow Rd.Â  Thus, the master concluded SCDOT's closing of the\r\n  grade crossing effected a taking of respondent's easement of access to Farrow\r\n  Road.Â  \r\nWe find the master\r\n  erred in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent.Â  There is no\r\n  question respondent satisfied the first element of inverse condemnation, as SCDOT's closing of Killian Road was affirmative conduct of a government\r\n  entity.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to SCDOT, however, we\r\n  find that while the closure was effected for a public purpose, there remains a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact whether SCDOT's actions constituted a taking.Â \r\n  Specifically, there is a question whether respondent had an easement of access\r\n  as an abutting landowner to Farrow Road. Â Respondent's property is separated\r\n  from Farrow Road by the strip of land surrounding the railroad track, and there\r\n  has been no evidence presented of the quantum of the estate of that portion of\r\n  land.Â  Because further inquiry into the facts of this case is desirable to\r\n  clarify the application of the law, we find summary judgment was not\r\n  appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on our finding\r\n  the factual record is insufficient for summary judgment, the decision of the\r\n  master is\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  I concur in result and agree that the presence of a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact renders summary judgment inappropriate.Â  I write separately\r\n  because my view of the law is reflected in Justice Waller's dissent in Hardin\r\n    v.

Â This Court certified this\r\n  case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nFacts/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nOn\r\n  November 26, 2006, the Clarendon County Sheriff's Office received an anonymous\r\n  tip about dogfighting at a mobile home off Jackson Road in Clarendon County.Â \r\n  Respondents Orlando Coulette (Coulette) and Jennifer Lyles (Lyles) lived in the\r\n  mobile home.Â  This tip was received around 7:00 p.m. when the officers were\r\n  just about to change shifts.Â  Because the tip came in around shift change, the\r\n  deputies were instructed to stay over and wait at a church approximately two\r\n  miles from the mobile home in case they were needed.Â  Two deputies then drove\r\n  past the Jackson Road address on a public road and observed a large number of\r\n  vehicles parked at the mobile home and spotlights shining in an area next to\r\n  the mobile home.Â  \r\nApproximately\r\n  forty-five minutes to an hour after receiving the anonymous tip, law\r\n  enforcement gathered at the church, paired up in several cars, and drove to the\r\n  address to investigate further.Â  The mobile home was located down a dirt road\r\n  shared by at least one other mobile home.[1]Â \r\n  The deputies initially had their car headlights off as they drove down the\r\n  shared road.Â  When the deputies turned their headlights on, they saw people and\r\n  dogs running away from the mobile home.Â  Sergeant Clay Conyers testified that\r\n  as he got out of his car to chase the people and the dogs, he could hear dogs\r\n  fighting in the woods behind the mobile home.Â Â  Two deputies testified that\r\n  while they were driving down the dirt road they saw a portable dogfighting pit\r\n  in the area with the spotlights.Â  Corporal Bernie Thorton testified that as the\r\n  deputies arrived, people were trying to dismantle the dogfighting pit.Â Â Â  \r\nThe deputies\r\n  apprehended and detained the people who ran away, and captured as many loose\r\n  dogs as possible.Â  Sergeant Dan Cutler (Sergeant Cutler) was the investigations\r\n  supervisor called to the Jackson Road location after the deputies found\r\n  evidence of dogfighting there.Â  After Sergeant Cutler observed the dogfighting\r\n  pit with fresh blood and hair on the panels, and a dog with fresh lacerations,\r\n  he advised the deputies to place the Respondents under arrest for dogfighting.Â \r\n  While securing the scene, deputies saw in plain view dogfighting paraphernalia,\r\n  including a dogfighting pit, dog muzzles, drugs, syringes, several injured\r\n  dogs, and a dog suspension collar.Â  Deputies obtained a search warrant the next\r\n  day and seized additional evidence from the yard and from inside the mobile\r\n  home.Â  The probable cause for the search warrant was premised on the evidence\r\n  seized the previous night. \r\nPrior to trial, Coulette and Lyles moved to suppress all evidence seized on the property on the\r\n  ground that law enforcement did not have a warrant and there was not an\r\n  emergency such that the deputies could come onto the property.Â  The other\r\n  Respondents joined the motion to suppress, contending their seizures and\r\n  subsequent arrests were premised on their presence at the scene and the\r\n  illegally seized evidence.Â  The State argued Respondents had no expectation of\r\n  privacy in the driveway and the visible front of the residence.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  fleeing people and dogs created exigent circumstances that justified the\r\n  warrantless entry onto the property.Â  The State further asserted the evidence\r\n  seized without a warrant was in plain view, and the arrests were based on that\r\n  evidence.Â  \r\nAfter hearing\r\n  testimony, the circuit court granted Respondents' motion to suppress, finding\r\n  the exigent circumstances exception did not apply, and the plain view exception\r\n  was precluded because discovery of the evidence was not inadvertent.Â  Because\r\n  the search warrant for the mobile home was obtained based on the evidence\r\n  seized without a warrant, the court suppressed all of the State's evidence,\r\n  precluding further prosecution of the State's case.Â Â  \r\n\r\nIssue\r\nDid the\r\n  circuit court err in granting Respondents' motion to suppress because the\r\n  evidence at issue was properly seized under the plain view and exigent\r\n  circumstances exceptions to the warrant requirement, and inadvertent discovery\r\n  is not required for purposes of the plain view exception to the warrant\r\n  requirement?\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\n&quot;The\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Gaster, 349\r\n  S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93&nbsp;(2002) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error\r\n  of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary\r\n  support.&quot;Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528,\r\n  539&nbsp;(2000) (citation omitted).Â  When reviewing a Fourth Amendment search\r\n  and seizure case, an appellate court must affirm if there is any evidence to\r\n  support the ruling. Â State v. Missouri, 361 S.C. 107, 111, 603 S.E.2d\r\n  594, 596&nbsp;(2004) (citation omitted).Â  &quot;The appellate court will\r\n  reverse only when there is clear error.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe State contends\r\n  the circuit court erred as a matter of law in granting Respondents' motion to\r\n  suppress because the evidence at issue was properly seized under the plain view\r\n  and exigent circumstances exceptions to the warrant requirement.Â  The State\r\n  further contends that inadvertent discovery is not required for purposes of the\r\n  plain view exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe Fourth\r\n  Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  U.S. Const.\r\n  amend. IV.Â  &quot;A search compromises the individual interest in privacy; a\r\n  seizure deprives the individual of dominion over his or her person or\r\n  property.&quot;Â  Horton v. California,&nbsp;496 U.S. 128, 133, 110 S.\r\n  Ct. 2301, 2306&nbsp;(1990) (citation omitted).Â  Warrantless searches and\r\n  seizures are unreasonable absent a recognized exception to the warrant\r\n  requirement.Â  Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 390, 98 S. Ct. 2408, 2412\r\n  (1978) (citations omitted).Â  Recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement\r\n  include plain view and exigent circumstances.Â  See State v. Beckham,&nbsp;334\r\n  S.C. 302, 317, 513 S.E.2d 606, 613&nbsp;(1999) (recognizing the plain view\r\n  doctrine as an exception to the warrant requirement); State v. Brown,\r\n  289 S.C. 581, 587, 347 S.E.2d 882, 886&nbsp;(1986) (recognizing the exigent\r\n  circumstances doctrine as an exception to the warrant requirement). \r\nI.&nbsp; Plain\r\n  View\r\n&quot;Under\r\n  the 'plain view' exception to the warrant requirement, objects falling within\r\n  the plain view of a law enforcement officer who is rightfully in a position to\r\n  view the objects are subject to seizure and may be introduced as\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  Beckham, 334 S.C. at 317, 513 S.E.2d at 613.Â \r\n  Consistent with federal law prior to 1990, South Carolina case law regarding\r\n  the plain view exception requires: (1) the initial intrusion which afforded the\r\n  authorities the plain view was lawful; (2) the discovery of the evidence was\r\n  inadvertent; and (3) the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately\r\n  apparent to the seizing authorities.Â  Beckham, 334 S.C. at 317, 513\r\n  S.E.2d at 613 (citation omitted).Â  However, in Horton v. California,&nbsp;496\r\n  U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301&nbsp;(1990), the United States Supreme Court (USSC)\r\n  discarded the inadvertent discovery requirement for the plain view exception.Â \r\n  In doing so, the USSC noted, &quot;evenhanded law enforcement is best achieved\r\n  by the application of objective standards of conduct, rather than standards\r\n  that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the officer.&quot;Â  Horton,&nbsp;496\r\n  U.S. at 138, 110 S. Ct. at 2308-09.Â  Moreover, &quot;[t]he fact that an officer\r\n  is interested in an item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course\r\n  of a search should not invalidate its seizure if the search is confined in area\r\n  and duration by the terms of a warrant or a valid exception to the warrant\r\n  requirement.&quot;Â  Id. at 138, 110 S. Ct. at 2309.Â  We take this\r\n  opportunity to join with the majority of states and adopt Horton, thereby\r\n  discarding the inadvertence requirement of the plain view doctrine.Â  Hence, the\r\n  two elements needed to satisfy the plain view exception are: (1) the initial\r\n  intrusion which afforded the authorities the plain view was lawful and (2) the\r\n  incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent to the seizing\r\n  authorities.\r\nA.&nbsp; Initial\r\n  Intrusion Was Lawful\r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the deputies' observations from the public highway and the\r\n  dirt road, the anonymous tip, and the exigent circumstances that developed\r\n  after the deputies entered the shared dirt road justified the initial intrusion\r\n  onto the property surrounding Coulette's residence to capture fleeing suspects\r\n  and dogs, ensure public safety, and prevent further destruction of evidence.Â \r\n  We agree.[2]\r\n1.&nbsp; Investigative\r\n  Authority and Exigent Circumstances\r\n&quot;What\r\n  a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is\r\n  not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.&quot;Â  Katz v.

U.S., 517 U.S. 806, 814, 116 S. Ct. 1769,\r\n  1775&nbsp;(1996) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).Â  In the Fourth\r\n  Amendment context, a court is concerned with determining whether a reasonable\r\n  officer would be moved to take action.Â  See id. at 815, 116 S.\r\n  Ct. at 1775.Â Â  \r\nIn this case, the\r\n  deputies responded to an anonymous tip by first driving by the residence on a\r\n  public road.Â  From this road, deputies observed a large number of vehicles at\r\n  the mobile home and saw spotlights shining next to the mobile home.Â  These\r\n  observations were not subject to any Fourth Amendment protection because they\r\n  were knowingly exposed to the public.Â  Moreover, these observations would give\r\n  a reasonable police officer in the deputies' position cause to go forward.Â \r\n  However, even absent these observations, the police had the investigative\r\n  authority to approach the front door of the mobile home in order to investigate\r\n  the anonymous tip.Â  Respondent Coulette's defense counsel admitted that the\r\n  police may lawfully knock on the door after receiving a complaint.Â  If the\r\n  deputies could properly drive up the dirt driveway to get to the front door,\r\n  then their observations of the dogfighting pit and fleeing people and dogs did\r\n  not exceed their investigative authority.\r\nThe\r\n  deputies' observations as they drove down the dirt road corroborated the\r\n  anonymous tip and gave them ample reason to believe dogfighting was in\r\n  progress.Â  Exigent circumstances developed when the suspects started fleeing.Â \r\n  Moreover, the presence of dogs created a potential danger to the deputies.Â \r\n  Hence, the deputies had the authority to perform a protective sweep of the\r\n  premises.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  initial intrusion by the deputies onto Coulette's property was lawful, both\r\n  because the deputies had the investigative authority to enter the property,\r\n  pursuant to the anonymous tip and observation from a public road, and because\r\n  exigent circumstances developed after entering the private driveway.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find that the State has satisfied the first element of the plain\r\n  view exception to the warrant requirement. \r\n\r\nB.&nbsp; Incriminating\r\n  Nature of Evidence Was Immediately Apparent\r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the incriminating nature of the evidence they saw in plain\r\n  view was immediately apparent.Â  We agree.\r\nWhile securing the\r\n  scene, deputies saw in plain view dogfighting paraphernalia, including the\r\n  dogfighting pit, dog muzzles, drugs, syringes, several injured dogs, and a dog\r\n  suspension collar.Â  The incriminating nature of this evidence was immediately\r\n  apparent considering the deputies were there to investigate a tip concerning\r\n  dogfighting.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nAs noted above, the\r\n  better approach to the plain view doctrine is to discard the inadvertent\r\n  discovery requirement as the United States Supreme Court did in Horton.Â \r\n  Thus, the two elements necessary for the plain view doctrine are: (1) the\r\n  initial intrusion which afforded the authorities the plain view was lawful and\r\n  (2) the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent to the\r\n  seizing authorities.Â  In this case, the initial intrusion by the deputies was\r\n  lawful and the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent,\r\n  hence, the suppression of the evidence by the circuit court is reversed.Â  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur. Acting Justice Howard P. King concurring in part and\r\n  dissenting in part in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE\r\n  KING:Â  Respectfully, I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I agree with\r\n  the majority that the inadvertent discovery requirement is no longer realistic,\r\n  and that we should join the majority of states in discarding this requirement.Â \r\n  However, I disagree that this Court may then decide the remaining two\r\n  requirements of the plain view doctrine according to its own view of the\r\n  facts.Â  For that reason, I would remand the case for the trial court to make\r\n  those determinations.\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002) (citations omitted).Â \r\n  The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will\r\n  not be reversed unless it is based upon an error of law.Â Â  State v. McDonald,\r\n  343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  Here, the trial court granted\r\n  the defendants' motion to suppress based upon an error of lawâ€”its conclusion\r\n  that the State must prove the discovery was inadvertent.[3]Â \r\n  The trial court did not make specific findings regarding the remaining\r\n  requirements of the plain view doctrine: (1) whether the initial intrusion\r\n  which afforded the authorities the plain view was lawful, and (2) whether the\r\n  incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent to the seizing\r\n  authorities.Â  See State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 317, 513 S.E.2d 606,\r\n  613 (1999) (outlining the requirements of the plain view doctrine).Â  Therefore,\r\n  in my view, the proper result would be to adopt the appropriate standard as\r\n  established in Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S.Ct. 2301\r\n  (1990), and remand the case to allow the trial court to make the factual\r\n  determinations regarding the remaining two elements.\r\nPLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It appears from the Record that the dirt road is a private road.\r\n[2] At trial, the State conceded that the anonymous tip alone would not have\r\n  created probable cause to search.Â  The State contends that the circuit court\r\n  erroneously interpreted this concession to mean there was no probable cause at\r\n  the time the deputies entered Coulette's property.Â  We agree. Â The State argued\r\n  throughout the motion hearing that the search and seizure was supported by the\r\n  exigent circumstances and plain view doctrines.\r\n[3] Certainly, the trial judge could not foresee a change in the law, and he\r\n  correctly relied upon the existing law when he made his ruling.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26932","title":"Oblachinski v.

Knox McMahon, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No.Â  26932\r\nHeard November 4, 2010 - Filed February\r\n  22, 2011Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHeath Preston Taylor, of Taylor Law Firm, LLC, of West Columbia, and\r\n  Katherine Carruth Goode, of Winnsboro, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tMark Steven Barrow, of Sweeny Wingate &amp; Barrow, PA, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN: In this case, we are asked to decide\r\n  whether South Carolina should recognize a third party cause of action for\r\n  negligent diagnosis of sexual abuse.Â  We hold no such cause of action exists and affirm the circuit court's grant\r\n  of summary judgment.Â Â  Â Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nDwight\r\n  Raymond Reynolds (&quot;Reynolds&quot;), as the Medical Director of the\r\n  Lexington County Children's Center, Inc., examined a four-year old girl\r\n  (&quot;Victim&quot;) for sexual abuse.Â  Reynolds examined Victim for thirty\r\n  seconds to one minute, took photographs and videotape for later reference,\r\n  diagnosed Victim with a torn hymen, and concluded she had been sexually\r\n  abused.Â  Kirby Oblachinski (&quot;Oblachinski&quot;) subsequently was indicted\r\n  for criminal sexual conduct with a minor, but the charges were dropped after a\r\n  second doctor concluded Reynolds misdiagnosed the child and opined Reynolds'\r\n  examination fell below the standard of care.Â  \r\nOblachinski brought\r\n  a civil suit against his accusers, and Reynolds testified during that action on\r\n  Oblachinski's behalf.Â  Reynolds admitted there was no evidence of blunt\r\n  force trauma to the hymen, Victim had a &quot;perfectly normal hymen,&quot; and\r\n  he had made a mistake in his earlier diagnosis. Following this civil suit,\r\n  Oblachinski brought a separate suit against Reynolds and Lexington Pediatric\r\n  Practice, (collectively, \r\n  &quot;Respondents&quot;) alleging negligence in examining and diagnosing\r\n  Victim. \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court granted Respondents' motion for summary judgment, finding that\r\n  Respondents owed no duty of care to Appellant.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nOblachinski\r\n  raises one issue on appeal:Â  Did the circuit court err in granting summary\r\n  judgment to Respondents based on a determination that they owed no duty of care\r\n  to Oblachinski?Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment, an appellate\r\n  court applies the same standard applied by the circuit court.Â  Lanham v.\r\n    Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d\r\n  331, 333 (2002).&nbsp; Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\r\n  issue of material fact such that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a\r\n  matter of law.&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488,\r\n  493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  &quot;In determining whether any triable\r\n  issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n  the non-moving party.&quot;Â  David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C.\r\n  242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006).Â Â  A motion for summary\r\n  judgment on the basis of the absence of a duty is a question of law for the\r\n  court to determine. See Doe v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 375 S.C. 63, 72, 651 S.E.2d 305, 309 (2007) (recognizing that whether a duty exists is a question of law\r\n  for the courts).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOblachinski contends the circuit court erred by finding Reynolds\r\n  owed no duty of care to him.Â  Oblachinski therefore urges this Court to find an\r\n  exception to the general rule that no duty of care exists between a physician\r\n  and a third party.Â Â  Respondents argue South Carolina case law limits\r\n  situations where a third party can bring a suit against a physician, and that\r\n  these facts do not fall within the recognized exception to the general rule.Â \r\n  We agree with Respondents and affirm the circuit court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment.Â  \r\nAn essential element in a cause of action\r\n  based upon negligence is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the\r\n  defendant to the plaintiff.Â  Without a duty, there is no actionable negligence.Â Â  Bishop v. S.C. Dep't of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 82\r\n  (1998) (citing Rogers v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Parole &amp; Community Corrections, 320 S.C. 253, 464 S.E.2d 330 (1995)).Â Â  As a general rule, only\r\n  a patient can maintain an action against a doctor for medical negligence.Â  See\r\n    id. at 91, 502 S.E.2d at 84.Â  However, a doctor-patient relationship is not\r\n  required in every legal action against a medical provider.Â  Hardee v. Bio-Medical Applications of S.C., Inc., 370 S.C. 511, 515, 636 S.E.2d 629, 631 (2006) (citing Bishop,\r\n  331 S.C. at 92, 502 S.E.2d at 84.).Â  Limited circumstances exist where a\r\n  reasonably foreseeable third party can maintain a suit against a physician for\r\n  malpractice.Â  Bishop, 331 S.C. at 92, 502 S.E.2d at 84.Â Â  \r\nIn Bishop,\r\n  following the grandmother's involuntary commitment of the mother, the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Mental Health (&quot;Department&quot;) determined the\r\n  victim's mother was not mentally ill and released her.Â Â  The next day, the\r\n  mother arrived at the grandmother's home and after being permitted to remove\r\n  her minor daughter from the grandmother's care, the mother physically abused\r\n  the child.Â Â  The grandmother brought a negligence action against the\r\n  Department, contending the child was a foreseeable plaintiff, and that the Department\r\n  owed a duty to the child to properly diagnose and treat the mother.Â Â  See\r\n    Bishop, 331 S.C. at 84, 502 S.E.2d at 80.Â  While recognizing the\r\n  possibility that a reasonably foreseeable third party could bring a claim\r\n  against a physician under certain circumstances, the Court held Department's\r\n  duty to properly diagnose and treat was owed only to the mother, and not to the\r\n  child.Â  See id. at 92, 502 S.E.2d at 84.Â  \r\nSeveral\r\n  years later, in Hardee, the Court found the facts gave rise to the duty\r\n  recognized in Bishop. There, the Hardees were injured when a\r\n  patient of a dialysis center lost control of his automobile and struck their vehicle\r\n  after leaving one of his treatments.Â  See Hardee, 370 S.C. at 513, 636\r\n  S.E.2d at 630. The Hardees sued the dialysis center for negligence, asserting\r\n  it should have warned the patient of the risks of operating a motor vehicle\r\n  after a dialysis treatment.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor\r\n  of the dialysis center and this Court reversed, finding the center had a duty to\r\n  warn a dialysis patient of the risks associated with operating a motor vehicle,\r\n  and by failing to do so, it breached the duty owed to the Hardees as reasonably\r\n  foreseeable third parties injured by the patient's actions. Id. at 516,\r\n  636 S.E.2d at 631-32.Â  \r\nOblachinski\r\n  argues Hardee and Bishop permit reasonably foreseeable third\r\n  parties to pursue negligence claims against medical providers.Â  Initially, we\r\n  note that although the Bishop Court stated that such a duty may exist\r\n  under limited circumstances, no duty was recognized on the facts of that case.Â \r\n  Moreover, &quot;[f]oreseeability of injury, in and of itself, does not give rise to a duty.&quot;Â  Charleston\r\n    Dry Cleaners &amp; Laundry, Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co., 355 S.C. 614, 618, 586 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2003) (citing South\r\n      Carolina State Ports Authority v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., 289\r\n  S.C. 373, 346 S.E.2d 324 (1986)).Â  Â Importantly, the duty recognized in Hardee mirrored the duty owed to the patient.Â  As noted in Hardee, &quot;this\r\n  duty owed to third parties is identical to the duty owed to the patient, i.e.,\r\n  a medical provider must warn a patient of the attendant risks and effects of\r\n  any treatment.&quot;Â  Hardee, 370 S.C. at 516, 636 S.E.2d at 632. In\r\n  both Bishop and Hardee, the actions hinged on conduct by the\r\n  patient which injured the third-party plaintiff.Â  Here, Oblachinski asks us to\r\n  extend the limited duty recognized in Hardee to a non-patient injured by\r\n  the negligence of the doctor in diagnosing a patient. Â Â Â Even though the harm\r\n  which befell Oblachinski as a result of the misdiagnosis may have been\r\n  reasonably foreseeable, we believe important policy concerns weigh against\r\n  extending a duty to him in this case.\r\nThe devastating nature of child sexual abuse charges requires that\r\n  they be lodged only after a careful and thorough investigation.Â  Juxtaposed\r\n  against this important principle is the equally compelling goal of protecting\r\n  children from sexual abuse. Â Â Medical diagnoses of sexual abuse as well as a\r\n  child's ability to accurately relate the history of such incidents are not as\r\n  absolute and infallible as they ought to be, given the serious consequences\r\n  that may result.Â Â  In our view, the good faith willingness of medical providers\r\n  to identify the existence of sexual abuse should not be chilled or otherwise\r\n  compromised by subjecting them to malpractice actions.Â  While in no way\r\n  minimizing the traumatic effect to an individual wrongfully accused of child\r\n  sexual abuse, an analysis of the competing policy ramifications of our decision\r\n  persuades us to refuse to recognize a cause of action in this situation.Â Â  \r\nWe note that no other state has recognized a cause of action under\r\n  similar facts. Â Instead, other jurisdictions have specifically declined to\r\n  extend a duty of care from physicians to third parties in such instances.Â Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Althaus ex rel. Althaus v.\r\n      Cohen, 562 Pa. 547,\r\n  553-54, 756 A.2d 1166, 1169 (2000) (consequences of burdening medical\r\n  professionals outweighed imposing duty of care); Vineyard v. Kraft, 828 S.W.2d 248, 252-53 (Tex. App. 1992) (physician owed\r\n  no duty to father of child in connection with alleged negligent misdiagnosis of\r\n  sexual abuse).Â  A Texas case, Dominguez\r\n    v. Kelly, 786 S.W.2d 749\r\n  (Tex. App. 1990), is instructive.Â  There, criminal proceedings were instituted\r\n  against Dominguez, in part because of Dr. Kelly's examination and report that\r\n  the female victim, who had been brought to Kelly by a member of the Texas\r\n  Department of Human Services, had been sexually assaulted along with a\r\n  discovery of syphilis.Â  Id. at 750.Â Â  Subsequent testing negated Kelly's\r\n  conclusion of syphilis.Â  Dominguez sued Kelly for negligence in the diagnosing\r\n  and reporting of his conclusions, and summary judgment was granted in favor of Â Kelly\r\n  based on the lack of a duty owed by Kelly to Dominguez. Dominguez, 786\r\n  S.W.2d at 750-51.Â  The Texas Court of Appeals held that the &quot;doctor's only\r\n  duty is to conduct the examination in a manner not to cause harm to the person\r\n  being examined.&quot; Id. (citing Johnston v. Sibley, 558 S.W.2d\r\n  135 (Tex. App. 1977)).Â  Similarly here, we believe Respondents' duty extended\r\n  only to the patient.\r\nThe dissent contends we should recognize a duty of care between\r\n  professionals and third parties as it relates to reckless examination and\r\n  diagnosis.Â  The arguments before the circuit court on the motion for summary\r\n  judgment were based solely on whether a duty existed on these facts.Â  While the\r\n  dissent correctly notes that Oblachinski pled recklessness in his complaint, at\r\n  no time during the arguments on the motion before the circuit court, at the\r\n  post-trial motion stage, or in briefs or oral argument before us was the issue\r\n  of recklessness raised. Therefore, whether a duty might exist between a\r\n  physician and a third party based on reckless misdiagnosis of sexual abuse is\r\n  not an issue before this Court and we decline to address it. Langley v. Boyter, 284 S.C. 162, 181, 325 S.E.2d 550, 561 (1984), rev'd, 286 S.C.\r\n  85, 332 S.E.2d 100 (1985) (â€œ[A]ppellate courts in\r\n  this state, like well-behaved children, do not speak unless spoken to and do\r\n  not answer questions they are not asked.â€).Â Â  \r\nWe decline to be the first state appellate court to recognize the\r\n  existence of a duty flowing between a physician and a third party under these\r\n  circumstances.Â  Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment.[1] Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I dissent in part and\r\n  concur in part.Â  I agree that the question of the existence of a duty is one\r\n  for the Court, and that policy concerns must govern our decision to extend the\r\n  duty of a diagnosing physician to a third party.Â  I also agree that we must\r\n  tread warily where the diagnosis sought to be challenged is that of sexual\r\n  abuse of a child.Â  Moreover, these concerns lead me to agree that negligence\r\n  alone is not the appropriate standard for the duty.Â  I would hold, however,\r\n  that a professional owes a duty to third persons to refrain from examining and\r\n  diagnosing a child as a victim of sexual abuse in a reckless manner.[2]Â \r\n  In finding such a duty, I have considered not only the stigma that attaches to\r\n  a person accused of such abuse, but also of the suffering of a child falsely\r\n  labeled a sexual abuse victim.\r\nI would reverse the\r\n  order of the circuit court as I find that appellant pled that respondent\r\n  recklessly misdiagnosed sexual abuse, and thus alleged a breach of the duty\r\n  that I would recognize today.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Because we find no duty of care\r\n  exists, we decline to address Respondents' other arguments.Â Â  See State v.

Rule\r\n  8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that\r\n  reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a\r\n  lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for\r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\r\n  misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer\r\n  to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  \r\nFurther, respondent admits her\r\n  misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for lawyer to be convicted of a serious crime), and 7(a)(5) (it\r\n  shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to\r\n  pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice\r\n  law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent from the practice of law retroactively to the\r\n  date of her interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\n  that she has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender\r\n  her Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Since formal charges were not filed prior to\r\n  January 1, 2010, an indefinite suspension remains a possible sanction under\r\n  prior Rule 7(b)(2), RLDE.Â  See Amendments to the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement Order dated October 16, 2009.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26934","title":"In the Matter of David Harrison Smith, II","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26934","description":"This is an opinion disbarring a lawyer.","date":"2011-02-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of David Harrison\r\n      Smith, II,Â Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26934\r\nSubmitted January 24, 2011 - Filed February 22, 2011Â Â  \r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Ericka M.

Â If respondent had conducted\r\n  monthly reconciliations, he would have discovered a significant number of\r\n  outstanding checks, some more than four years old.Â Â Â  \r\nÂ In August 2009, a warrant was\r\n  issued for Ms. Pressley's arrest in connection with the checks drawn on\r\n  respondent's trust account.Â  Respondent fully cooperated with law enforcement\r\n  in the investigation and prosecution of Ms. Pressley.Â  Respondent also retained\r\n  an outside accountant to reconcile his account and to determine the extent of the\r\n  misappropriation.Â  Further, he replaced his clients' funds with personal funds,\r\n  and he opened a new trust account and made arrangements with his bank to insure\r\n  that outstanding checks were paid from the new account.Â  Respondent reissued\r\n  checks to replace outstanding checks that had not been delivered.Â  He\r\n  self-reported this matter to ODC in January 2010.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he violated\r\n  other provisions of the Court's rules.Â  In particular, he admits he failed to\r\n  adequately account for law firm funds maintained on deposit in his trust\r\n  account to cover bank charges and fees, resulting in overdrafts to that\r\n  subaccount.Â  Further, he did not prepare settlement statements on all of his\r\n  contingency cases in violation of Rule 1.5, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Moreover,\r\n  respondent's firm had a practice of disbursing checks to clients and to his\r\n  firm prior to actually depositing and collecting the funds to cover the\r\n  disbursements.\r\nIn addition, respondent issued\r\n  at least two checks to cash.Â  Although he has been able to document the\r\n  purposes of those checks and demonstrate the funds were properly paid,\r\n  respondent acknowledges he violated the provision of Rule 417, SCACR, that\r\n  requires trust account checks be made payable to a named payee and not to cash.Â \r\n  Finally, on two occasions following the opening of his new trust account,\r\n  respondent inadvertently wrote checks from the wrong account, resulting in\r\n  insufficient funds.Â  The errors were corrected upon discovery and no client\r\n  funds were lost.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct,\r\n  he has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR,\r\n  particularly Rule 1.5 (contingent fee agreement shall be in writing signed by\r\n  the client and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined), Rule\r\n  1.15 (lawyer shall safe keep client funds; lawyer shall not disburse funds from\r\n  an account containing funds of more than one client or third person unless\r\n  funds to be disbursed have been deposited in the account and are collected\r\n  funds), and Rule 5.3 (lawyer having direct supervisory authority over\r\n  non-lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is\r\n  compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer).Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the\r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent also admits he violated the recordkeeping\r\n  provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand with conditions.Â  Accordingly, we accept the\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his\r\n  misconduct.Â  Further, within six months of the date of this order, respondent\r\n  shall complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Trust Account School and,\r\n  for a period of one year from the date of this opinion, respondent shall submit\r\n  his monthly trust account reconciliations to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26936","title":"In the Matter of Marva Ann Hardee-Thomas","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26936","description":"The Supreme Court held that definite suspension for a period of two years was an appropriate sanction for an attorney who mishandled clientsâ€™ trust account funds and failed to maintain adequate trust account records, such that a forensic accounting was required to understand the extent of the misappropriation of client funds.","date":"2011-02-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Marva Ann Hardee-Thomas Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26936\r\nHeard January 6, 2011 - Filed February 22,\r\n  2011Â Â  \r\nTWO YEAR DEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley\r\n  M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and William C. Campbell, Assistant\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tJames\r\n  K. Holmes, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this\r\n  attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed\r\n  formal charges on allegations of misconduct against Marva Ann Hardee-Thomas\r\n  (Respondent) involving her mishandling of clients' trust account funds.Â \r\n  Following a hearing, the Hearing Panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the\r\n  Panel) recommended Respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of\r\n  law, along with certain other requirements.Â  Neither the ODC nor Respondent\r\n  took exception to the Panel Report.[1]Â \r\n  However, because the sanction of indefinite suspension is no longer an\r\n  available sanction under the revised South Carolina Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE),[2] this Court determines Respondent's sanction without recommendation from the\r\n  Panel and orders Respondent's suspension from the practice of law for a period\r\n  of two (2) years from the date of this opinion.Â  Further, we adopt all of the\r\n  additional recommendations made by the Panel and order Respondent to complete\r\n  these recommendations within the time period recommended by the Panel. \r\nFacts\r\nI.&nbsp; Matter A\r\nIn Matter\r\n  A, a client complained that Respondent failed to pay medical providers out of\r\n  the settlement proceeds of a personal injury case, resulting in a tax lien\r\n  being placed on the client and negatively impacting the client's credit\r\n  rating.Â  In Respondent's Answer, she contended that she delayed in paying the\r\n  surgeon and chiropractor because of uncertainty as to whether Medicaid had paid\r\n  the doctors and placed a statutory lien on the settlement proceeds, or whether\r\n  Respondent was to pay the doctors directly.Â  Respondent maintained that as soon\r\n  as she resolved the Medicaid lien question she paid the medical providers.Â \r\n  Respondent paid the medical providers more than a year after she received the\r\n  settlement proceeds on behalf of the client in Matter A.Â  Respondent did not\r\n  deposit the amounts necessary to pay medical providers into the trust account,\r\n  and finally paid the providers out of her office account.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Matter B\r\nIn Matter\r\n  B, a client complained that he was not paid the amount owed to him after\r\n  Respondent settled his accident case with an insurance company. Respondent\r\n  answered that she received the settlement check for that case on the day she\r\n  had met with the ODC and was placed on interim suspension.Â  She deposited the\r\n  full check for $4,500 into her trust account, which brought the balance to\r\n  $2,715.81.Â  Respondent admitted that $3,000 was owed to her client and that she\r\n  does not know why there were not enough funds in her trust account to cover the\r\n  balance.Â  Respondent paid neither the medical providers listed on the settlement\r\n  statement nor the client.Â  The client was forced to file a claim with the South\r\n  Carolina Bar Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (Lawyers' Fund) to recover for\r\n  his loss. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Matter C \r\nIn Matter C, the client complained that Respondent\r\n  failed to pay medical providers out of the proceeds of the client's settlement.Â \r\n  Respondent admits that she failed to pay $3,589.70 to certain medical providers\r\n  as represented in the settlement statement to the client.Â  The client in Matter\r\n  C was unable to recover from the Lawyers' Fund because she must first satisfy\r\n  medical bills before she seeks recovery from the Lawyers' fund, and she lacks\r\n  the funds to do so.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Matter D\r\nIn Matter D, Respondent failed to pay third party\r\n  medical providers in the amount of $1,826.50, as represented in the settlement\r\n  statement given to the client.Â  The client was also unable to recover from the\r\n  Lawyers' fund because she must first satisfy medical bills before she seeks\r\n  recovery from the Lawyers' fund, and she lacks the funds to do so.\r\n\r\nV.&nbsp; Various Trust Account\r\n  Matters\r\nIn\r\n  addition to the failure to pay settlement sums to certain clients and medical\r\n  providers, Respondent failed to properly maintain trust account records,\r\n  reconcile her trust account, or maintain client ledgers pursuant to the\r\n  requirements of Rule 1.15 of Rule 407, SCACR, and Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent carried\r\n  a negative balance of $96.11 in her trust account from July 19, 2007 to August\r\n  14, 2007.Â  Additionally, Respondent paid several bills from her trust account\r\n  that were unrelated to client matters.Â  Respondent maintained her office,\r\n  trust, and personal accounts at the same bank and mistakenly authorized a payment\r\n  from her trust account of $595.79 to pay her husband's BellSouth phone bill,\r\n  never reimbursing the trust account. Â Respondent mistakenly caused drafts\r\n  payable to Bank of America to be drawn from her trust account in the amounts of\r\n  $500 and $160 that were negotiated to a credit card company for expenses unrelated\r\n  to client matters, then failed to reimburse the trust fund for these mistaken\r\n  drafts.Â  On several occasions, Respondent wrote checks on her trust account\r\n  made payable to herself with the memo field reflecting &quot;Law Office\r\n  Costs&quot; without any accounting as to which client's case these costs were\r\n  charged.Â  Generally, Respondent's trust account was so poorly maintained that\r\n  an accurate accounting was not possible with the records provided and, therefore,\r\n  it is unknown which clients are owed funds and what funds are missing from the\r\n  trust account. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nUltimately,\r\n  the Panel found that Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:\r\n\r\n\tRule 1.1 (Competence)\r\n\tRule 1.3 (Diligence)\r\n\tRule 1.15 (Safekeeping Property)\r\n\tRule 8.4 (a) (Misconduct)\r\n\tRule 8.4(d) (Conduct involving\r\n  dishonesty)\r\n\tRule 8.4(e) (Conduct prejudicial\r\n  to the administration of justice)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Panel found\r\n  that Respondent violated Rules 7(a)(1) &amp; 7(a)(6), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nThe Panel determined that Respondent should be\r\n  indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.Â  Additionally, the Panel\r\n  recommended that Respondent undergo a full forensic accounting of her trust\r\n  account, reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for all payments made on her behalf, and\r\n  receive continuing legal education in trust accounting prior to petitioning\r\n  this Court for reinstatement into the practice of law.Â  Finally, the Panel\r\n  recommended that Respondent immediately pay restitution to the parties who were\r\n  unable to collect from the Lawyers' Fund, and pay for the cost of the\r\n  proceedings.Â  Respondent testified that she would agree to all of these\r\n  recommendations.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThe\r\n  sole authority to discipline attorneys and decide appropriate sanctions after a\r\n  thorough review of the record rests with this Court.Â  In re Thompson,\r\n  343 S.C. 1, 10-11, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  In such matters, this Court may\r\n  draw its own conclusions and make its own findings of fact. Â Id.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, the findings and conclusions of the Panel are entitled much\r\n  respect and consideration.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  \r\nAnalysis\r\nThe\r\n  sanction of indefinite suspension recommended by the Panel was no longer an\r\n  available sanction under the amended RLDE contained in Rule 413, SCACR.Â \r\n  Therefore, this Court will determine a sanction without a recommendation from\r\n  the Panel. The record of this case includes five attorney discipline opinions,\r\n  all decided prior to the rule changes, and apparently relied upon by the Panel\r\n  when deciding what sanctions to impose on Respondent.Â  In four of the five\r\n  cases, the attorneys were disbarred as a result of the misappropriation of\r\n  rather large sums of clients' trust account monies.Â  It appears that the Panel\r\n  found the present case to be more in line with In re Johnson, 380 S.C.\r\n  76, 668 S.E.2d 416 (2008), an attorney discipline matter resulting in\r\n  indefinite suspension.Â  In that case, Respondent was charged with three\r\n  instances of misconduct, all involving the misappropriation of clients'\r\n  settlement funds. Id. at 80-81, 668 S.E.2d at 418.Â  The quantity of\r\n  money misappropriated in that case was substantially higher than in the present\r\n  case and appeared to be a product of deception, rather than a product of\r\n  careless record-keeping.Â  See id. (Over a five year period, and after\r\n  repeated inquiry from the client, Respondent wired only $5,525 of the $75,822\r\n  in settlement proceeds to a client, misappropriating the rest).Â  Regardless of\r\n  the factual differences between the two cases, it is apparent that the Panel\r\n  believed a lesser sanction than disbarment was in order for Respondent's\r\n  actions.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Panel's finding that a lesser sanction than disbarment is\r\n  merited in this case.Â  With the exception of the client in Matter B, whose\r\n  settlement check arrived on the day that Respondent was placed on interim\r\n  suspension, Respondent disbursed settlement sums to her clients, but in many\r\n  cases failed to make full payments to third party medical providers.Â \r\n  Respondent's handling of her trust account was, at best, haphazard and\r\n  slovenly; at worst, deceptive.Â  However, considering the comparative cases and\r\n  the mitigating factors noted by the Panel, we believe that a term of definite\r\n  suspension from the practice of law will allow Respondent to adequately reflect\r\n  on her actions and to learn proper methods of recording and administering\r\n  client funds. \r\nFrom\r\n  a review of attorney discipline cases under the revised RLDE where trust\r\n  account mismanagement was involved and where a lesser sanction than disbarment\r\n  was imposed, In the Matter of Witcraft bears the strongest resemblance\r\n  to this case. 387 S.C. 301, 692 S.E.2d 534 (2010).Â  In that case, the attorney\r\n  received a settlement check in the amount of $21,000, of which $19,000 was owed\r\n  his client.Â  Id. at 303, 692 S.E.2d at 535.Â  The attorney did not\r\n  immediately disburse the proceeds, but instead misappropriated the money and\r\n  was waiting to obtain funds from other sources to replace the funds owed to his\r\n  client.Â  Id.Â  The attorney finally admitted to the client that he could\r\n  not pay the client what was owed to him, but would pay him $5,000 from his\r\n  personal account and issue a promissory note for the remainder.Â  Id.Â  An\r\n  accounting of the attorney's trust fund showed that he used the money to pay debts\r\n  owed on his student loan, various credit card companies, and retail stores.Â  Id.Â \r\n  This Court imposed a two year definite suspension.Â  Id.\r\n&quot;This Court has made it abundantly clear than an\r\n  attorney is charged with a special responsibility in maintaining and preserving\r\n  the integrity of trust funds.&quot; In the Matter of Houston, 382 S.C.\r\n  164, 167, 675 S.E.2d 721, 723 (2009) (citation omitted).Â  Here, Respondent\r\n  admits that she failed to properly maintain adequate financial records, and as\r\n  a result, clients' money was used to pay her personal expenses and other\r\n  clients' expenses.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  of Respondent's inept handling of trust account funds, medical providers did\r\n  not receive payment for their services, a client was unable to apply for credit\r\n  due to a tax lien placed by a medical provider, and another client did not\r\n  receive the money owed to him under a settlement agreement.Â  The failure to\r\n  keep proper financial records in accordance with the Rules is a serious offense\r\n  and merits a serious sanction.Â  This Court considers as an aggravating\r\n  circumstance the duration of Respondent's reckless record- keeping habits.Â \r\n  Additionally, Respondent had prior disciplinary history that included a Letter\r\n  of Caution without a finding of misconduct, and an Admonition citing Rules 1.1\r\n  (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), and 1.4 (Communication).Â  However, Respondent's\r\n  full acceptance of responsibility for her actions and her willingness to accept\r\n  all of the recommendations of the Panel, bear in favor of a two year definite suspension,\r\n  rather than disbarment.Â Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we order Respondent's suspension from the practice of law for a period\r\n  of two years from the date of this opinion.Â  Additionally, we follow the\r\n  Panel's recommendations and order that prior to Respondent's petition for\r\n  reinstatement into the practice of law, Respondent must undergo a forensic\r\n  audit of her trust accounts for the years 2001 through 2007, complete the South\r\n  Carolina Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program and Trust Accounting School, and\r\n  reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for all payments made on her behalf.Â  Respondent\r\n  must also reimburse the ODC for the costs of these proceedings within sixty\r\n  days of this opinion.Â  Finally, if Respondent has not done so already, she\r\n  shall immediately pay restitution to the clients of Matters C and D, who were\r\n  unable to recover from the Lawyers' Fund, in the amounts specified by the\r\n  Panel.Â  Â \r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  Neither party filed briefs with this Court.Â  Therefore, the parties are deemed\r\n  to have accepted the Panel's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\n  recommendations.Â  See Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;The\r\n  failure of a party to file a brief taking exceptions to the report constitutes\r\n  acceptance of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\n  recommendations.&quot;).Â  \r\n[2] See Amendments to the South Carolina Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Order dated October 16, 2009 (the amended rules apply to cases\r\n  where formal charges are pending on the effective date of January 1, 2010).Â  In\r\n  this case, the formal charges were filed on November 20, 2008 and May 19, 2009,\r\n  but these charges were pending on January 1, 2010.Â  Therefore, the new rules\r\n  should have been applied in this case.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
