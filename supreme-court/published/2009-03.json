Furthermore, the individual components of a steel belted\r\n    radial tire are designed to work in conjunction with the other components of\r\n    that tire.Â  As a result, the forces exerted on the tire during its operation\r\n    are subject to the combined effects of many parameters, including tire size;\r\n    inflation pressure; component materials, dimensions, and gauge; as well as\r\n    vehicle characteristics.Â  Therefore, it is not accurate to gauge the\r\n    performance of any particular tire by focusing on one isolated component or\r\n    compound.\r\n  . . . . \r\n  . . . Given the inherent design of any steel belted radial tire, .\r\n    . . the areas of the steel belt edges are generally the areas of highest\r\n    stress/strain. Â As a result, any steel belted radial tire can sustain a\r\n    tread/belt separation due to numerous service conditions such as overloading,\r\n    underinflation, punctures, road hazards, impact damage and so forth.\r\n\r\nQueiser\r\n  further explained that rubber compound formulas cannot be reverse engineered\r\n  from the finished product because once a tire is cured, the chemical\r\n  composition changes. Queiser asserted that because the physical properties of\r\n  the subject tire itself could be inspected and tested, â€œ[a]ccess to the formulas\r\n  is unnecessary to determine whether the tire was properly designed and\r\n  manufactured.â€Â  As to the trade secret nature of the skim stock formula,\r\n  Queiser described the formula as â€œone of Bridgestone/Firestoneâ€™s most valuable\r\n  assets and most closely guarded secrets.â€Â  \r\nAt his\r\n  deposition, when asked why the skim stock formula was unnecessary in the\r\n  instant litigation, Queiser responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  Well, I guess in this case, as I understand it, all that you would\r\n    need is what you essentially have.Â  You have the tire, you have the ability to\r\n    test the tire, test its physical properties.Â  It has been my experience that\r\n    that is all you need to evaluate the condition of the tire as it relates to its\r\n    performance.Â  It is my experience that the ability to have the chemical\r\n    information, the recipe, really doesnâ€™t answer those questions for you.Â  The\r\n    formula or recipe doesnâ€™t give you the performance, frankly, which is the most\r\n    important element.\r\n\r\nQueiser\r\n  elaborated that when the federal government investigated certain tires\r\n  manufactured by Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., which were similar to tires\r\n  recalled by Firestone in August 2000, â€œ[f]ormula was not part of the report . .\r\n  . , it was all about the performance, the design of the tire from a mechanical\r\n  and structural perspective and the performance of that tire.Â  It was not about\r\n  the chemical constituents or the recipe.â€ When pressed by Respondentâ€™s\r\n  counsel as to whether the skim compound or manufacturing process was ever\r\n  considered as part of the federal investigation, Queiser answered as follows:\r\n\r\n  No, I would not say â€œnever\r\n    considered.â€Â  But certainly it was something that was clearly early set aside\r\n    as a probable cause.Â  We had so many tires produced from so many different\r\n    plants with that same formula, hundreds of which . . . had absolutely no claim\r\n    or lawsuit associated with them on that same compound.Â  That formula or\r\n    compound, per se, no, it wasnâ€™t a factor early on.\r\n\r\nQueiser also described how rubber changes over time from\r\n  exposure to oxygen and ozone, noting that â€œ[t]he environment, the use of the\r\n  tire or the rubber, how the rubber is used, [and] other external influences\r\n  naturally are a part of its properties over time.â€Â  Queiser acknowledged that\r\n  oxidation in general would cause changes in the makeup of a rubber compound,\r\n  but qualified his statement saying that chemical changes in rubber compounds,\r\n  in his opinion, were still not fully understood by modern science.Â  Queiser also acknowledged that antidegradants are\r\n  added to the skim stock compound to combat the effects of oxygen on a tire and\r\n  that there were â€œother inherent qualitiesâ€ of other ingredients in the tire\r\n  which â€œmay also lend themselves to some resistance to change.â€Â  Queiser\r\n  nonetheless adhered to his view that by physically testing the subject tire -\r\n  perhaps by viewing it at a microscopic level - would be the appropriate way to\r\n  assess whether there is a design defect.Â  \r\nFinally, Queiser testified that the skim\r\n  stock compound chemically interfaces with the brass which covers the steel\r\n  belts, and that this â€œis one of the essences of the trade secret nature of the\r\n  chemical composition and the production of that compound.â€Â  If a competitor were\r\n  to have knowledge on this aspect of tire design, Queiser stated that the\r\n  competitor would essentially acquire â€œa companyâ€™s decadesâ€™ worth of experienceâ€\r\n  which would give it â€œa huge competitive advantage.â€Â  \r\nRespondent presented three experts to opine on the need\r\n  for the skim stock formula in support of the motion to compel.Â  Robert C. Ochs\r\n  stated in an affidavit that he had evaluated the subject tire to determine why\r\n  the tire failed.[5]Â \r\n  Ochs averred as follows:\r\n\r\n  My initial evaluation of the tire reveals that the tire failed\r\n    prematurely as a result of a defect in the tire.Â  At this time I cannot state\r\n    whether the defect is in the manufacture or design of the tire.Â  \r\n  [Respondent has] requested that I work together with James E.\r\n    Duddey, Ph.D. and Richard J. Smythe, Ph.D. to determine if the failure was the\r\n    result of a manufacturing defect or a design defect.Â  In order to perform the\r\n    specific work requested by [Respondent] it will be necessary to compare the\r\n    failed tire with its initial physical properties as designed by Bridgestone.Â  \r\n  Because this failure involves a separation of the tread belt, it\r\n    will be necessary to examine the skim compound formula to aid in determining\r\n    the true nature of the defect.Â  Once the skim compound used to manufacture the\r\n    subject tire is analyzed, both for its intended physical properties and as\r\n    compared to the central compound formula, I will then be able to render\r\n    opinions on the true nature of the defect.\r\n\r\nRespondentâ€™s second expert, Dr. James Duddey inspected the failed\r\n  tire and made the following observations in his affidavit:[6]\r\n\r\n  Examination of the tire demonstrates a premature failure caused by\r\n    the separation of the steel belts.Â  The tire shows evidence of surface cracking\r\n    that could be caused by fatigue or premature rubber aging.Â  The tire tread\r\n    piece examined demonstrates a degree of hardness in the skim stock that may be\r\n    related to either the initial physical properties of the rubber compound or\r\n    premature aging.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  because Respondentâ€™s counsel specifically requested that Duddey review the skim\r\n  stock formula to determine whether a design defect existed in the subject tire,\r\n  and whether changes made to the antidegradant package used in the skim stock\r\n  formula affected the aging mechanical properties of the tire, Duddey stated that\r\n  he needed â€œaccess to documents showing the initial physical properties of the\r\n  rubber compound to determine whether there exists a plant specific\r\n  manufacturing issue or an overall design issue.â€Â  \r\nAt his deposition,\r\n  Duddey acknowledged that a number of factors, such as overload and\r\n  underinflation, could cause belt separation in tires that were properly\r\n  designed.Â  Duddey also explained that there were multiple possible causes for\r\n  the increased hardness found in the subject tire, including oxidative aging and\r\n  heat exposure.Â  \r\nAs to needing the skim stock formula in order to determine why the\r\n  subject tire exhibited hardness, Duddey testified that â€œas a starter you need\r\n  to know what the properties were as the tire was designed and manufactured and\r\n  then you need to try to make some judgment as to if itâ€™s significantly\r\n  different than when it was manufactured, how it got to that point.â€Â  Duddey\r\n  admitted, however, that both the hardness and the cracking found in the subject\r\n  tire did not necessarily relate back to the formulation of the compound, but\r\n  could also have been associated with how the tire had been used.Â  Duddey explained\r\n  that if Bridgestone provided the skim stock formula for the subject tire,\r\n  ultimately all he could do was make a comparison as to â€œwhat is the general\r\n  practice that is out there in the supplier literature and the technical\r\n  literature.â€Â  \r\nRespondentâ€™s\r\n  third expert, Dr. Richard Smythe, was hired to analyze certain materials within\r\n  the tire deemed important by experts Ochs or Duddey.[7]Â  Smythe indicated that he would\r\n  design an analytical protocol in order to evaluate certain aspects of the skim\r\n  stock formula and that if Ochs and Duddey determined that the subject tire did\r\n  not exhibit the physical properties intended by its design, he would be able to\r\n  assist in a root-cause analysis of why that tire failed.Â  Smythe asserted that\r\n  it was â€œabsolutely necessaryâ€ that he know all of the ingredients in the rubber\r\n  compound in order to render his expert opinion in the matter.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter considering the expertsâ€™ depositions and the partiesâ€™\r\n  supplemental briefs, the trial court issued an order compelling discovery and issued\r\n  a restrictive protective order.[8]Â \r\n  Specifically, the trial court found that Respondent had met the prerequisites\r\n  for discovery of trade secret information under either Rule 26(c), SCRCP, or\r\n  the South Carolina Trade Secrets Act, S .C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-10 et seq. (Supp. 2007) (hereinafter â€œTrade Secrets\r\n  Actâ€).Â  The trial court\r\n  concluded that Respondentâ€™s experts had established the need for the skim stock\r\n  formula, stating as follows:\r\n\r\n  [Respondentâ€™s] claim [is] that the failed tire experienced a steel\r\n    belt separation.Â  It further appears it is the skim stock compound that is\r\n    designed to provide adhesion between the steel belts and between surrounding\r\n    components.Â  As such, the composition of the ingredients, both actual and\r\n    intended, and the method by which the rubber compound was made is relevant to\r\n    the inquiry into why the subject tire failed.Â  While it may be possible, it\r\n    appears unlikely that [Respondent] could seriously pursue a design defect\r\n    theory without access to the materials and methods used to manufacture the\r\n    portion of the tire claimed to be responsible for the failure.\r\n\r\nBridgestone\r\n  thereafter petitioned for certiorari review of the trial courtâ€™s order in this\r\n  Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction.Â  The Court granted the petition and Bridgestone\r\n  raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    What is the\r\n  appropriate standard for the discovery of trade secret information in a product\r\n  liability action?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court\r\n  err in finding that Respondent established the requisite need for Bridgestone&rsquo;s\r\n  trade secret skim stock formula?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOrdinarily,\r\n  an order compelling discovery is not directly appealable.Â  Lowndes Products,\r\n    Inc. v. Brower, 262 S.C. 431, 205 S.E.2d 184&nbsp;(1974).Â  Nevertheless, a\r\n  writ of certiorari may be issued when exceptional circumstances exist.Â  See\r\n    In re Breast Implant Product Liability Litigation, 331 S.C. 540, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  445 (1998).Â  The instant case presents such exceptional circumstances as it\r\n  involves a novel question of law in a matter that has been the subject of\r\n  numerous claims in state and federal courts.Â  A decision by this Court at this\r\n  time best serves the interests of judicial economy by eliminating the numerous\r\n  inevitable appeals raising this novel issue of significant public interest.Â  Id. n.2. Â \r\nOn\r\n  certiorari, review by the Court is confined to the correction of errors of\r\n  law.Â  Berry v. Spigner, 226 S.C. 183, 84 S.E.2d 381 (1954).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe\r\n  begin our analysis by putting the legal nature of a trade secret into context.Â \r\n  As aptly described in a recent opinion by the Indiana Supreme Court:\r\n\r\n  Trade\r\n    secrets are unique creatures of the law, not property in the ordinary sense,\r\n    but historically receiving protection as such. Â Unlike other assets, the value of a trade secret\r\n    hinges on its secrecy. Â As more people or organizations learn the secret, the\r\n    value quickly diminishes. Â For this reason, owners or inventors go to great\r\n    lengths to protect their trade secrets from dissemination.\r\n  The value of trade secret\r\n    protection to a healthy economy has been widely accepted for some time. Â Over\r\n    the last two hundred years, the law has developed mechanisms for accomplishing\r\n    this end.\r\n\r\nBridgestone Am. Holding, Inc. v. Mayberry, 878 N.E.2d 189, 192&nbsp;(Ind. 2007) (footnote omitted).\r\nHowever, it is also\r\n  true that â€œtrade secrets may be valuable during the\r\n  course of litigation not involving misappropriation claims, and there are\r\n  moments when justice requires disclosure.â€Â  Id. at 193.Â  In spite of\r\n  this acknowledgement of the potential value of trade secrets in litigation, the Mayberry court also cautioned that â€œcourts must proceed with care when\r\n  supervising the discovery of trade secrets, lest the judiciary be used to\r\n  achieve misappropriation or mere leverage.â€Â  Id.\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Standard for Discovery of Trade Secrets\r\nThe\r\n  question of what standard governs the discovery of trade secret information is\r\n  a novel issue in South Carolina.Â  Under the Trade Secrets Act, a person â€œaggrieved\r\n  by a misappropriation, wrongful disclosure, or wrongful use of his trade\r\n  secrets may bring a civil action to recover damages incurred as a result of the\r\n  wrongful acts.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-30(C).Â  The Trade Secrets Act addresses\r\n  discovery matters and provides in pertinent part as follows: \r\n\r\n  (A) In an action under this\r\n    chapter, a court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by\r\n    reasonable means, which may include granting protective orders in connection\r\n    with discovery proceedings, holding hearings in-camera, sealing the records of\r\n    the action, and ordering any person involved in the litigation not to disclose\r\n    an alleged trade secret without prior court approval.\r\n  (B) In any civil action where discovery is sought of\r\n    information designated by its holder as a trade secret, before ordering\r\n    discovery a court shall first determine whether there is a substantial need by\r\n    the party seeking discovery for the information.\r\n  â€œSubstantial needâ€ as used in\r\n    this section means:\r\n  \r\n    (1) the allegations in the initial pleading setting\r\n      forth the factual predicate for or against liability have been plead with particularity;\r\n    (2) the information sought is directly relevant to the\r\n      allegations plead with particularity in the initial pleading;\r\n    (3) the information is such that the proponent of the\r\n      discovery will be substantially prejudiced if not permitted access to the\r\n      information; and\r\n    (4) a good faith basis exists for the belief that\r\n      testimony based on or evidence deriving from the trade secret information will\r\n      be admissible at trial.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-60.Â \r\n  Although Respondent suggests that the Trade Secrets Act only applies to those\r\n  actions alleging trade secret misappropriation,[9] we find that the plain language of Â§ 39-8-60(B) clearly indicates that trade\r\n  secrets may be protected during discovery not only in misappropriation cases,\r\n  but in â€œany civil actionâ€ where trade secrets are sought during discovery.Â  See\r\n    Key Corp. Capital, Inc. v. County of Beaufort, 373 S.C. 55, 59, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  675, 677&nbsp;(2007) (noting that where a statuteâ€™s language is plain,\r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, the court has no right to impose\r\n  another meaning).Â  \r\nThis\r\n  is not to say, however, that the â€œsubstantial needâ€ language of the Trade\r\n  Secrets Act is the sole relevant inquiry in determining the standard governing\r\n  trade secret information.Â  As Respondent points out, the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure also provide for the protection of trade secret information\r\n  when such information is sought during discovery.Â  Specifically, Rule 26(c),\r\n  SCRCP, allows for protective orders under certain circumstances as follows:\r\n\r\n  Upon motion by a party or by\r\n    the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, the\r\n    court in which the action is pending . . . may make any order which justice\r\n    requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment,\r\n    oppression, or undue burden by expense, including one or more of the following:\r\n    . . . (7) that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or\r\n    commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated\r\n    way.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  determining whether trade secret information is subject to a protective order\r\n  under Rule 26(c)(7), federal and state courts typically apply a balancing test that\r\n  incorporates a â€œrelevant and necessaryâ€ standard for the party seeking to\r\n  discover the trade secret information.[10]Â \r\n    See generally 8 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Watson, Annotation, Discovery of Trade\r\n    Secret in State Court Action, 75 A.L.R.4th 1009, 1028-30 (1990).Â  The test\r\n  is a three-part inquiry:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The party opposing discovery must\r\n  show that the information sought is a trade secret and that disclosure would be\r\n  harmful.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    If trade secret status is\r\n  established, the burden shifts to the party seeking discovery to show that the\r\n  information is relevant and necessary to bring the matter to trial. \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    If both parties satisfy their\r\n  burden, the court must weigh the potential harm of disclosure against the need\r\n  for the information in reaching a decision. \r\n  \r\n\r\nSee\r\n  also Mayberry, 878 N.E.2d at 193; Coca-Cola\r\n    Bottling Co. of Shreveport, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 107 F.R.D. 288, 292-93\r\n(D. Del. 1985).[11]Â  \r\nWe disagree\r\n  with Respondentâ€™s argument that our determination that the Trade Secrets Act applies\r\n  to any civil action impermissibly supplants a rule of civil procedure.Â  See\r\n    Baggerly v. CSX Transp., Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 635 S.E.2d\r\n  97&nbsp;(2006) (rejecting an interpretation of a statute which would have\r\n  contravened a rule of evidence).Â  Unlike the statute at issue in Baggerly,\r\n  Â§ 39-8-60 does not improperly limit the operation of Rule 26, but rather is\r\n  consistent with Rule 26 in that both provide for reasonable restrictions on the\r\n  discovery of trade secrets.Â  The Trade Secrets Act therefore does not supplant,\r\n  but rather complements, Rule 26(c), SCRCP.Â  Cf. Mayberry, 878\r\n  N.E.2d at 194 (finding that the application of Rule 26 to trade secrets â€œshould\r\n  be informed by Indianaâ€™s enactment of the Uniform Trade Secrets Actâ€). \r\nTo\r\n  this end, we hold that the balancing test associated with the discovery of\r\n  trade secret information under Rule 26(c), SCRCP, governs the discovery of\r\n  trade secret information in this matter.Â  Regarding the requirement that the\r\n  trade secret information must be â€œrelevant,â€ we hold that the information must\r\n  be relevant not only to the general subject matter of the litigation, but also relevant\r\n  specifically to the issues involved in the litigation.Â  See Duplan Corp. v.\r\n    Deering Milliken, Inc., 397 F.Supp. 1146, 1185&nbsp;(D.S.C. 1974).Â  For the\r\n  trade secret information to be deemed â€œnecessary,â€ we hold that the party\r\n  seeking the information â€œcannot merely assert unfairness but must demonstrate\r\n  with specificity exactly how the lack of the information will impair the\r\n  presentation of the case on the merits to the point that an unjust result is a\r\n  real, rather than a merely possible, threat.â€Â  In re Bridgestone/Firestone,\r\n    Inc., 106 S.W.3d 730, 733&nbsp;(Tex. 2003); accord\r\n      Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 709,\r\n  713&nbsp;(Cal. Ct. App. 1992) (holding that a party seeking discovery must make\r\n  a â€œparticularized showingâ€ that â€œthe information sought is essential to a fair\r\n  resolution of the lawsuitâ€).Â  â€œImplicit in this is the notion that suitable\r\n  substitutes must be completely lacking.â€ Â Mayberry,&nbsp;878 N.E.2d at\r\n  196.Â  In other words, the trial court must evaluate whether there are\r\n  reasonable alternatives available to the party seeking the discovery of the\r\n  information, and ultimately, the trial court must require the discovery of a\r\n  trade secret only when â€œthe issues cannot be fairly adjudicated unless the\r\n  information is available.â€Â  Wright &amp; Miller, Â§ 2043. \r\nFrom\r\n  here, we turn to an analysis of the second issue on appeal in order to\r\n  determine whether Respondent meets the â€œrelevant and necessaryâ€ standard of\r\n  proof for discovery of a trade secret.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Application of the standard to Respondentâ€™s request\r\nfor Bridgestoneâ€™s skim stock formula\r\nBridgestone argues\r\n  that the trial court erred in finding that discovery of the skim stock formula\r\n  was necessary to Respondentâ€™s case.Â  Specifically, Bridgestone contends that:Â \r\n  (1) the expert testimony does not establish that if the experts were provided\r\n  the skim stock formula and related manufacturing information, they would\r\n  necessarily be able to opine on a defect; and (2) other methods, such as testing\r\n  the tire itself, are available to Respondent.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn our view, Respondentâ€™s expertsâ€™ reasons for opining that the\r\n  formula was necessary for their analyses do not rise to the level of\r\n  specificity required for discovery of trade secrets.Â  For example, expert\r\n  Smythe did not elaborate on why it was â€œabsolutely necessaryâ€ that he know the\r\n  skim stock formula in order to render his expert opinion in the matter.Â \r\n  Furthermore, although expert Ochs concluded in his affidavit that it was necessary\r\n  to compare the failed tire with its initial physical properties because the\r\n  tireâ€™s failure involved a separation of the tread belt, Ochs never explained\r\n  how the occurrence of a tread belt separation should result in the automatic\r\n  conclusion that the belt separation was related to the initial physical\r\n  properties of the tire requiring disclosure of the skim stock formula.Â  Given\r\n  Queiserâ€™s and Duddeyâ€™s testimony on the many potential causes of tread belt\r\n  separation related to the usage of the tire rather than its initial physical\r\n  properties, we find that Ochsâ€™s testimony lacks the precision required for\r\n  Respondent to show that disclosure of Bridgestoneâ€™s skim stock formula is\r\n  necessary to this case.Â  See also\r\n    Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d at 716 (finding that the tire expert did not â€œdescribe\r\n  with any precision how or why the formulas were a predicate to his ability to\r\n  reach conclusions in the caseâ€).Â  \r\nExpert Duddeyâ€™s reasoning for acquiring the formula\r\n  was similarly vague.Â  In his affidavit, Duddey initially attributed the\r\n  apparent surface cracking on the subject tire to either\r\n  â€œfatigue or premature rubber aging,â€ and the degree of hardness in the skim\r\n  stock to â€œeither the initial physical properties of the rubber compound or\r\n  premature aging.â€ When later asked at\r\n  deposition to elaborate on the need for the skim stock formula, Duddey\r\n  responded that â€œas a starter you need to know what the properties were as the\r\n  tire was designed and manufactured and then you need to try to make some judgment\r\n  as to if itâ€™s significantly different than when it was manufactured, how it got\r\n  to that point.â€Â  Duddey provided no indication in his response at deposition\r\n  that he had examined and subsequently discarded the alternative theories\r\n  propounded in his affidavit for the tireâ€™s failure.Â  For this reason, we find\r\n  that this testimony fails to adequately articulate how disclosure of the skim\r\n  stock formula is critical to the analysis in this case.Â  \r\nWe find also find no evidence that the skim stock\r\n  formula is essential to a defect inquiry.Â  Bridgestoneâ€™s expert Queiser clearly\r\n  indicated that because a tire is a complex object made up of many compounds, it\r\n  would be inaccurate to gauge the performance of a\r\n  particular tire by focusing on one isolated component or compound.Â  Queiser also\r\n  noted how properties of the skim rubber compounds change as the tire\r\n  ages.Â Â  Respondentâ€™s experts, however, focused solely\r\n  on the tireâ€™s initial properties without addressing Queiserâ€™s assertions\r\n  regarding the interaction of compounds in the tire during the curing process\r\n  and throughout the tireâ€™s lifetime.Â  In this way, we find Respondentâ€™s experts\r\n  failed to provide a sufficiently complete argument as to why the skim stock\r\n  formula was necessary to their analyses of this case. \r\nFurthermore, the expertsâ€™ testimony provides no\r\n  detailed indication as to how the case is incapable of being fairly adjudicated\r\n  without the trade secret information.Â  See In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.,\r\n  106 S.W.3d at 733 (holding that the party seeking trade secret information\r\n  cannot simply claim unfairness but must show â€œwith specificity how the lack of\r\n  the information will impair the presentation of the case on the merits to the\r\n  point that an unjust result is a real, rather than a merely possible,\r\n  threatâ€).Â  While we recognize the logic in Respondentâ€™s\r\n  theory that in order to prove a tire design or manufacturing defect, it would\r\n  be useful to have knowledge of the original recipe and whatever manufacturing\r\n  deviations were made from that recipe, we reiterate that the standard for\r\n  discovery of trade secret information is â€œnecessary,â€ not â€œuseful.â€Â  See Bridgestone/Firestone,\r\n    Inc. v. Superior Court, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d at 715 (finding that â€œit is not\r\n  enough that a trade secret might be usefulâ€ to the party seeking discovery).Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we find that the trial court failed to analyze the availability of reasonable\r\n  alternatives to the discovery of the trade secret. Â Specifically, a chemical\r\n  analysis necessitating the discovery of Bridgestoneâ€™s skim stock formula is not\r\n  the sole, or even the best, way to test for defects.Â  We\r\n  find an October 2001 report issued by the National Highway Traffic\r\n  Safety Administration (NHTSA) particularly\r\n  instructive to the Court in this regard.[12]Â  The stated purpose of the federal investigation documented in this\r\n  report was to determine whether Firestoneâ€™s August 2000 recall of Wilderness AT\r\n  tires was adequate in scope.Â Â  The report focused on non-recalled tires that\r\n  were manufactured primarily as original equipment for Ford Explorers, yet were\r\n  similar to the tires recalled by Firestone in 2000.Â  The study used peer tires,\r\n  mostly Goodyear Wrangler tires, in order to compare performance results to the\r\n  Wilderness AT tires being evaluated.\r\nThe methods of the federal\r\n  recall investigation, employed on both Firestone tires and the peer tires,\r\n  included â€œthorough analyses of available data regarding the performance of\r\n  tires in the field; shearography analysis to evaluate crack initiation and\r\n  growth patterns and their severity in tires obtained from areas of the country\r\n  where most of the failures have occurred; and observations, physical\r\n  measurements, and chemical analyses.â€Â  NHTSA Report at iii.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  NHTSA conducted belt peel adhesion testing, a physical test on one-inch wide\r\n  samples of tire tread which are essentially pulled by a tensile test machine\r\n  â€œto measure the force required to â€˜peelâ€™ the two belts apart.â€Â  Id.Â  The report explained the purpose of this test as follows:\r\n\r\n  [T]he properties of the belt wedge\r\n    and skim rubber compounds change as the tire ages.Â  These changes reduce the\r\n    compoundsâ€™ resistance to fatigue crack growth and catastrophic failure.Â  One\r\n    measure of the degradation of the belt rubber is the peel adhesion test.Â  This\r\n    test is most directly related to the belt rubberâ€™s resistance to a final,\r\n    catastrophic belt-leaving-belt failure.\r\n\r\nId.Â  The report specifically noted there was\r\n  â€œno evidence of a belt wire-to-rubber adhesion issue.â€Â  Id. at 23 n.38.\r\nThe NHTSA\r\n  concluded that a safety-related defect existed in Firestone Wilderness AT\r\n  P235/75R15 and P255/75R16 tires manufactured prior to May 1998 at specified\r\n  manufacturing facilities.Â  One of the primary findings was that the design of\r\n  the shoulder pocket of the tires could â€œcause high stresses at the belt edge\r\n  and lead to a narrowing of the wedge gauge at the pocket,â€ indicated by â€œa\r\n  series of weak spots around the tireâ€™s circumference, leading to the initiation\r\n  and growth of cracksâ€ in the tires. Â Id. at 30.Â  \r\nWe find it significant that the NHTSA, without focusing on the skim stock\r\n  formula, conducted physical testing of the tires and ultimately arrived at a\r\n  scientifically-supported conclusion that there was a design defect which caused\r\n  belt separation.Â  This reliance on a structural analysis to determine\r\n  defect, rather than a chemical analysis, provides tangible proof that other adequate means of testing for defects are available\r\n  to Respondent and that therefore, Respondentâ€™s case will not be substantially\r\n  impaired if he is denied access to the trade secret information.Â  We note that\r\n  other jurisdictions have similarly recognized that physically\r\n  testing the tire itself for defects, including testing at a molecular level if\r\n  necessary, may be a suitable substitute for testing based on the skim\r\n  stock formula.Â  See Mayberry,&nbsp;878 N.E.2d at 196 (noting that\r\n  testimony revealed that an inspection of the failed tire appears to be â€œmore\r\n  than an adequate substitute for examining the skim stock formulaâ€); In re\r\n    Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 106 S.W.3d at 733 (finding that because a tireâ€™s physical properties can be tested\r\n  without knowing the recipe for the skim stock compound, tests on a finished\r\n  tire are â€œmore probative of defect than its skim stock formula would beâ€).Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  the discovery already available to Respondent for analysis of the alleged\r\n  defect includes information about development, design review, and testing of\r\n  tires manufactured with the same specifications as the tire in this case.Â  Bridgestone\r\n  has also produced or agreed to produce analysis reports of inner liner problems\r\n  with similar tires, reports from cut tire analysis done at the Hofu plant, and\r\n  records and depositions from similar cases involving Bridgestone tires.Â  The\r\n  variety of information these documents encompass provides Respondent with\r\n  â€œsuitable substitutesâ€ for analysis of the skim stock formula itself.Â  Mayberry,\r\n  878 N.E.2d at 196.Â  Thus, particularly in light of the discovery obtainable in\r\n  this case, Respondent has not shown that the case is incapable of being fairly\r\n  adjudicated without the trade secret information.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we hold that under the proper standard governing the discovery\r\n  of trade secrets, knowledge of Bridgestoneâ€™s skim\r\n  stock formula is not â€œnecessaryâ€ in order for\r\n  Respondent to litigate the instant product liability action.[13]Â  Accordingly, we hold that\r\n  the trial court erred in finding that Respondent was entitled to discovery of\r\n  Bridgestoneâ€™s trade secret information.\r\nWe\r\n  note that Bridgestone should not use our holding in this matter at trial to\r\n  suggest weaknesses in Respondentâ€™s case due to his expertsâ€™ ignorance about the\r\n  formula.Â  See In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 106 S.W.3d at 734\r\n  (recognizing that it would be unfair for the manufacturer to argue the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s case was impaired due to lack of evidence that the manufacturer\r\n  withheld); Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d\r\n  at 716 n.8 (noting that it would be unfair for the manufacturer to challenge an\r\n  expert at trial about his knowledge of the skim stock formula).Â  Indeed, if at\r\n  any time during the litigation, Respondent can satisfy his burden of showing\r\n  necessity, this matter could be revisited.Â  See In re Bridgestone/Firestone,\r\n    Inc., 106 S.W.3d at 734 (finding that while the mere possibility of\r\n  unfairness is not enough to warrant disclosure of the information, this issue\r\n  can be addressed should it materialize).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold that Respondent failed\r\n  meet the standard for the discovery of Bridgestoneâ€™s trade secret information,\r\n  and therefore, we reverse the decision of the trial court compelling the\r\n  disclosure of Bridgestoneâ€™s trade secret.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent, and would affirm the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order compelling petitioner to disclose the skim stock\r\n  formula.Â  Since this order is before us on a common law writ of certiorari, we\r\n  may reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision only if it is affected by an error of\r\n  law.Â  Berry v. Spigner, 226 S.C. 183, 84 S.E.2d 381 (1954).Â  We cannot\r\n  consider the facts, â€œexcept to ascertain whether the order is wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence.â€Â  Id.Â  Since I find evidence in the record,\r\n  particularly the affidavit of Dr. Duddey, which supports the circuit courtâ€™s\r\norder, I would affirm.\r\nIn my opinion, the\r\n  majority reverses not because there is no evidence, nor because the circuit\r\n  court committed an error of law, but because, in the majorityâ€™s view, the\r\n  petitionersâ€™ experts were more persuasive than those of respondent.Â  For\r\n  example, the majority states respondentâ€™s experts did not address Queiserâ€™s\r\n  assertion that a tireâ€™s performance is not dependent on its initial\r\n  composition. Dr. Duddey, however, acknowledged that post-manufacturing factors\r\n  could explain the tireâ€™s failure, but also maintained that he needed the\r\n  formula in order to determine whether a design defect, perhaps in the\r\n  antidegradant package component of the formula, contributed to its failure.Â  In\r\n  my view, whether this was sufficiently specific is a judgment call for the\r\n  trial judge.\r\nMoreover, the\r\n  majority opines that â€œa chemical analysis necessitating the discovery of\r\n  Bridgestoneâ€™s skim stock formula is not the sole, or even the best, means to\r\n  test for defectâ€ and holds there is â€œno evidence that the skim stock formula is\r\n  essential to a defect inquiry.â€Â  It is not respondentâ€™s burden under either the\r\n  Trade Secrets Act or Rule 26 (c) (7), SCRCP to demonstrate that knowledge of\r\n  the trade secret is the â€œbestâ€ or â€œsoleâ€ way for it to proceed, nor that it is\r\n  â€œessential,â€ but rather that it has a â€œsubstantial needâ€[14] for this â€œrelevant and necessaryâ€[15] information.Â  Applying our limited scope of review on certiorari[16] to the order before us, I would hold there is evidence to support the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s findings that respondent has met his burden.\r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The subject tire is a P235/75R15 Radial ATX steel\r\n  belted radial passenger tire and was designed for use as a replacement tire.Â \r\n  At the time of the accident, the subject tire was being used as a spare and was\r\n  the only Bridgestone tire on the Explorer; Michelen manufactured the other\r\n  three tires.\r\n[2] According to Bridgestoneâ€™s expert witness, steel belt skim stock is â€œa\r\n  specifically formulated rubber compound calendered onto the steel cord to form\r\n  the steel belts in a steel belted radial passenger or light truck tire,â€ which\r\n  is â€œformulated to provide, among other things, adhesion between the rubber and\r\n  steel cord, and between the belts and surrounding components.â€Â  The formula of\r\n  a rubber compound such as the steel belt skim stock â€œtypically contains the\r\n  chemicals or ingredients used in the compound; the quantities or relative\r\n  percentages of those ingredients; and the manner in which those ingredients are\r\n  processed to form the compound and give it the desired physical properties\r\n  after it is vulcanized, or cured.â€ \r\n[3] Respondent has not disputed\r\n  that the skim stock formula is a trade secret.Â  Under South Carolina law, a trade secret is defined as\r\n  information, including a formula or process, that:\r\n\r\n  (i) derives independent economic value, actual or\r\n    potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily\r\n    ascertainable by proper means by the public or any other person who can obtain\r\n    economic value from its disclosure or use, and\r\n  (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the\r\n    circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-20(5)(a) (Supp. 2007).\r\n[4] Queiser, an employee of Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc.\r\n  since 1994, holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in aeronautical and astronautical\r\n  engineering as well as a masterâ€™s degree in engineering mechanics.Â  He stated\r\n  that he has â€œpersonally developed steel belted radial tires from concept\r\n  through . . . productionâ€ and that his experience included analysis of tire\r\n  failure.Â  \r\n[5] Ochs holds a bachelorâ€™s degree and a masterâ€™s degree in mechanical\r\n  engineering.Â  Michelin employed Ochs from 1969-1994, during which time his work\r\n  included analysis of failed passenger and light truck tires.\r\n[6] Duddey holds a Ph.D. in physical organic chemistry and\r\n  worked for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for thirty-two years.Â  \r\n[7]Â \r\n  Smythe, an analytical chemist, has been exposed to at least one proprietary\r\n  skim stock formula and has performed work on rubber compounds to determine why\r\n  they failed.Â  Smythe is not a tire engineer and does not claim to have\r\n  expertise in tire design or manufacturing.Â  \r\n[8] The trial court found that a protective order could be fashioned to protect the\r\n  trade secret status of the information, but â€œ[b]ecause the parties are in a\r\n  better position to narrow the issues on the terms of a protective order,â€ the\r\n  trial court instructed the parties to collaborate on the specific terms of the\r\n  protective order.Â  There is no protective order in the record presumably\r\n  because Bridgestone filed its petition for a writ of certiorari less than a\r\n  month after the trial courtâ€™s order.\r\n[9] In support of his position, Respondent asserts Griego\r\n  v. Ford Motor Co., 19 F.Supp.2d 531, 533 (D.S.C. 1998), in which the\r\n  federal district court held that the Trade Secrets Act\r\n  does not apply to a product liability action because it â€œis not based on\r\n  misappropriation of a trade secret or protection against such a\r\n  misappropriation.â€Â  We decline to adopt the reasoning set forth in Griego and note that a federal court decision interpreting state law is not\r\n  binding on this Court.Â  Blyth v. Marcus, 335 S.C. 363, 517 S.E.2d\r\n  433 (1999).\r\n[10] The language of Rule 26(c), SCRCP, mirrors that of\r\n  federal Rule 26(c).Â  Because there is no South Carolina precedent construing\r\n  this rule, federal interpretation\r\n  of Rule 26(c) is persuasive authority.Â  See State v. Colf, 332 S.C. 313, 317, 504 S.E.2d 360, 361 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n[11] Likewise, in jurisdictions where trade secrets are\r\n  protected by a codified evidentiary privilege, the courts apply a similar\r\n  balancing test.Â  See, e.g., In re Contâ€™l Gen. Tire, Inc.,\r\n  979 S.W.2d 609 (Tex. 1998); Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court,\r\n  9 Cal.Rptr.2d 709 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992).\r\n[12] See U.S. Depâ€™t of Trans., NHTSA, Office of Defects Investigation, Engineering\r\n  Analysis Report and Initial Decision Regarding EA00-023 Firestone Wilderness AT\r\n  Tires (October 2001) (hereinafter â€œNHTSA Reportâ€).Â  \r\n[13] Contrary to the dissentâ€™s assertion, we do not reverse the trial courtâ€™s order\r\n  compelling discovery based on our view of the expertsâ€™ testimonies.Â  Rather, we\r\n  reverse because Respondent failed as a matter of law to meet the applicable\r\n  standard governing the discovery of trade secrets.Â  \r\n[14] S.C.

Pitts, of Smoot, Pitts, Elliott &amp; Biel, of Hilton Head Island, for\r\n          Appellant\r\n        Robert\r\n          V. Mathison, Jr., of Mathison &amp; Mathison, of Hilton Head Island, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER:Â  This is a direct\r\n  appeal from the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of appellant Jim Aaronâ€™s action to\r\n  enforce California and Indiana judgments against respondent Susan Mahl (a/k/a\r\n  Susan Scott).Â  We certified the appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and now reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRespondent was a California attorney.[1]Â  Between 1996 and 1999, respondent\r\n  was a civil litigator and managing partner with the law firm now known as Rehon &amp; Roberts (â€œR&amp;Râ€).[2]Â \r\n  Respondent left the firm in November 1999 to start her own firm.Â  In January\r\n  2000, R&amp;R brought a California lawsuit against respondent for fraud and deceit, breach of fiduciary duty,\r\n  conversion, and other causes of action.\r\nIn\r\n  February 2001, she closed her practice, moved out of California, and then\r\n  traveled with appellant, who was her boyfriend at the time.Â  Eventually, she\r\n  moved to Bluffton, South Carolina.Â  In July 2001, respondent bought a house in\r\n  Bluffton for $234,918 in cash, although the Bluffton house originally was\r\n  titled in appellantâ€™s name.Â  According to appellant, respondent titled the\r\n  house in his name in order to secure it from judgment.[3]Â \r\n  Moreover, in August 2001, respondent petitioned the South Carolina family court\r\n  to legally change her name from Susan J. Mahl to Susan J. Scott.[4]Â  \r\nR&amp;Râ€™s case against\r\n  respondent went to trial on September 17, 2001.Â  By this time, the California trial court had struck respondentâ€™s answer and cross complaint due to discovery\r\n  abuse.Â  Respondent did not appear at trial, and judgment was entered in\r\n  R&amp;Râ€™s favor.Â  The California court granted general damages in the amount of\r\n  $749,572.37, plus $150,000 in punitive damages (â€œthe California judgmentâ€).Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  trial, respondent moved to have both the California judgment, and the sanction\r\n  order which had struck her answer, set aside. Respondent represented that after\r\n  she moved out of California, she received her mail through a mailing service\r\n  located in South Dakota.Â  Respondent claimed that although she had been aware\r\n  her trial originally had been set for September 10, 2001, she never received\r\n  notice that the case was scheduled for September 17, 2001, and did not know her\r\n  attorney had withdrawn on September 7, 2001.Â  She also alleged that her mental\r\n  condition - major depression - impaired her ability to participate in the\r\n  litigation.Â \r\n\r\nThe California trial court denied her motion to set aside the judgment.[5] Respondent appealed, but the California Court of Appeal affirmed.Â  Rehon\r\n  &amp; Roberts v. Mahl, 2003 WL 22810438, 1 (Cal. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2003).Â \r\n  The California Supreme Court denied review on February 18, 2004. Â \r\nIn November or\r\n  December of 2001, R&amp;R assigned the California judgment for\r\n    collection to appellant (â€œthe Assignmentâ€).[6]Â \r\n  There was also a collection agreement between R&amp;R and appellant.Â \r\n  This document stated, inter alia, that R&amp;R retained appellant as a\r\n  collector, and thereby assigned the California judgment to him.[7]Â \r\n  Appellant was to receive 50% of the proceeds he collected.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  December 2001, appellant filed suit against respondent in both Indiana and  South Carolina to enforce the California judgment.Â  The lawsuit filed in South Carolina is the subject of the instant appeal.\r\nOn October 24,\r\n  2002, the Indiana circuit court granted appellant summary judgment in favor of\r\n  appellant (â€œthe Indiana judgmentâ€).Â  The Indiana court specifically rejected\r\n  respondentâ€™s argument that R&amp;Râ€™s assignment to appellant was an invalid\r\n  partial assignment.Â  Respondent did not appeal the Indiana judgment.Â  In\r\n  January 2003, the Indiana court barred respondent from\r\n  disposing, transferring or removing any of her assets, and specifically ordered\r\n  respondent not to transfer any interest in her Bluffton house.Â  \r\nVarious pretrial\r\n  orders were also issued by the South Carolina court in the instant case.Â  For\r\n  example, on October 8, 2003, Judge Kemmerlin (the first Master in Equity\r\n  assigned to this case) entered an order which directed the Beaufort Clerk of\r\n  Court to enroll and index the California judgment, but delayed execution until\r\n  the California appellate process had finalized.\r\nAppellant moved for\r\n  summary judgment in the instant action after the California judgment became\r\n  final.Â  The trial court, however, denied the motion and ordered appellant to\r\n  produce the collection agreement.Â  In July 2004, respondent amended her\r\n  complaint to assert various counterclaims and defenses, including fraud on the\r\n  court and the affirmative defense of unclean hands.Â  \r\nOn March 20, 2006,\r\n  the case went to trial before Master-in-Equity Coltrane acting as a special\r\n  circuit court judge.Â  Ultimately, the trial court issued a written order of\r\n  judgment which found that appellant could not enforce the California judgment.Â \r\n  The trial court found various aspects of the collection agreement â€œtroubling,â€\r\n  and specifically found that the Assignment from R&amp;R to appellant was\r\n  invalid.Â  Additionally, the trial court decided that appellantâ€™s hands were\r\n  unclean because his actions were â€œrendered possible only through his personal\r\n  relationship withâ€ respondent. Â Accordingly, the trial court dismissed\r\n  appellantâ€™s complaint.[8]\r\nBoth parties moved\r\n  to alter or amend the judgment order.Â  In its amended order, the trial court\r\n  ruled on the issue of whether R&amp;R should have been joined as a plaintiff at\r\n  trial.Â  The trial court found that because appellant had previously objected to\r\n  respondentâ€™s pretrial attempts to join R&amp;R, he was estopped from seeking to\r\n  join the firm as a party.Â  Moreover, the trial court found joinder of R&amp;R\r\n  would not be just under Rule 21, SCRCP.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in failing\r\n  to find that respondent could not collaterally attack the California and Indiana judgments and by not giving full, faith and credit to both the California and Indiana judgments? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n     Did the trial court err in ruling\r\n  that appellant had unclean hands?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  action to enforce a judgment is an action at law. Â Minorplanet Sys. USA Ltd.\r\n    v. American Aire, Inc., 368 S.C. 146, 149, 628 S.E.2d 43, 45&nbsp;(2006).Â \r\n  In an action at law, tried by a judge without a jury, the findings of the trial\r\n  court must be affirmed if there is any evidence to support them. Â Townes\r\n    Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Full Faith and Credit / Collateral Estoppel\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial court erred by not granting full faith and credit to the California judgment and the Indiana judgment, both of which are final judgments.Â  In\r\n  addition, appellant contends the trial court should not have allowed respondent\r\n  to collaterally attack those judgments at the South Carolina trial.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution\r\n  provides that â€œFull Faith and Credit\r\n  shall be given in each state to the ... judicial proceedings of every other\r\n  state.â€ U.S. Const. art. IV, Â§ 1.Â  Generally, full faith and credit â€œâ€˜requires every\r\n  State to give to a judgment at least the res judicata effect which the\r\n  judgment would be accorded in the\r\n    State which rendered it.â€™â€Â  Hospitality Mgmt. Assocs. v.\r\n      Shell Oil Co., 356 S.C. 644, 653, 591 S.E.2d 611, 616&nbsp;(2004) (quoting Durfee v. Duke, 375 U.S. 106, 109 (1963)).Â  Therefore, â€œa foreign\r\n  judgment which is regular on its face generally may not be collaterally\r\n  attacked.â€Â  Bankers Trust Co. v. Braten, 317 S.C. 547, 550, 455 S.E.2d\r\n  199, 200&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).\r\nIn\r\n  other words, â€œthe judgment of a state court should\r\n  have the same credit, validity and effect, in every other court of the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.â€Â  Id.; see also Hamilton v. Patterson, 115 S.E.2d 68, 70&nbsp;(1960) (a\r\n  defendant may not a second time challenge the validity of a plaintiffâ€™s right\r\n  which has ripened into a judgment) (citation omitted).\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court erred by not enforcing the California judgment in South Carolina.Â  This judgment resulted from a trial at which respondent did not appear.Â \r\n  She subsequently attempted to set aside the judgment, but all her attempts at\r\n  appeal were denied by the California courts.Â  Thus, the trial court should have\r\n  followed the general principles of Full Faith and Credit in the instant case\r\n  and given effect to R&amp;Râ€™s valid foreign judgment.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  the basic principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel also apply. Â Res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the\r\n  claims arise out of the same occurrence that was the subject of a prior action\r\n  between those parties.Â  E.g., Riedman Corp. v. Greenville Steel\r\n    Structures, Inc., 308 S.C. 467, 469, 419 S.E.2d 217, 218&nbsp;(1992).Â  Collateral\r\n  estoppel prevents a party from re-litigating an issue in a subsequent suit which\r\n  was actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.Â  E.g., Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 349, 585 S.E.2d 281, 285&nbsp;(2003).\r\nHere,\r\n  respondent expressly raised the issue about the validity of the Assignment to\r\n  the circuit court in Indiana.[9]Â \r\n  The circuit court in Indiana granted appellant summary judgment and specifically rejected respondentâ€™s attack on the Assignment.Â  Respondent did not appeal from\r\n  that order.Â  Thus, the Indiana judgment, like the California judgment before\r\n  it, became final and is entitled to Full Faith and Credit.Â  Clearly, respondent\r\n  should have been collaterally estopped from making the same argument about the\r\n  Assignment to the South Carolina courts.Â  Id.\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  respondent maintains that because the collection agreement was not disclosed in\r\n  either the California or the Indiana litigation, she is permitted not only to\r\n  raise and litigate the issue again, but to have the entire lawsuit dismissed\r\n  because of the existence of the collection agreement (which she alleges\r\n  invalidates the Assignment).Â  Respondent, however, has already had her bites at\r\n  the apple.Â  In both the California and Indiana actions, respondent\r\n  unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the assignment; ultimately, she prevailed\r\n  here in South Carolina on the very same issue.Â  This was error.Â  We find res\r\n    judicata and collateral estoppel apply to preclude her from re-litigating\r\n  issues which have already been actually litigated in a prior action.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  further contends that the failure to produce the collection agreement amounts\r\n  to extrinsic fraud, and therefore, an exception should be made to the general\r\n  rules governing Full, Faith, and Credit and collateral estoppel.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is true that these general rules may not apply â€œwhere extrinsic fraud has been\r\n  practiced to procure the judgment.â€Â  Bankers Trust Co. v. Braten, 317\r\n  S.C. at 550, 455 S.E.2d at 200.Â  However, allegations that a party failed to\r\n  disclose documents generally amount to intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, fraud.\r\n  Â Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 579 S.E.2d 605 (2003).Â  Moreover,\r\n  relief from a judgment is generally denied in a case of intrinsic fraud because\r\n  when an issue has been litigated and determined in a former action, it â€œshould\r\n  not be retried, â€¦ otherwise litigation would be interminable.â€Â  Id. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (citation omitted).\r\nRespondent\r\n  maintains that a fraud on the court was perpetrated in Indiana when appellant\r\n  and his attorneys attached the Assignment to the complaint seeking to enforce\r\n  the California judgment.Â  In respondentâ€™s view, this amounted to a fabrication\r\n  because the collection agreement is the â€œtrueâ€ assignment document.Â  She\r\n  therefore argues the Indiana attorneys engaged in a scheme to defraud, and\r\n  appellant committed perjury in his affidavits which stated that the Assignment\r\n  was â€œa true and correct copy of the assignment.â€Â  \r\nAppellant, on the\r\n  other hand, argues that the collection agreement does not negate the Assignment,\r\n  and thus, there was nothing false about presenting the Assignment as evidence\r\n  that R&amp;R had assigned the California judgment to him for collection.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the facts of the instant case do not establish an extrinsic fraud on the\r\n  court.Â  See id. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (â€œThe subornation of perjury\r\n  by an attorney and/or the intentional concealment of documents by an attorney\r\n  are actions which constitute extrinsic fraud.â€).[10]Â  \r\n2.Â  Unclean Hands\r\nAppellant argues that the equitable defense of unclean hands should not have\r\n  been allowed because he was not seeking equity, but instead was pursuing an\r\n  action at law - the domestication and enforcement of a foreign judgment.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nThe doctrine\r\n  of unclean hands â€œprecludes a plaintiff from recovering in equity if he\r\n  acted unfairly in a matter that is the subject of the litigation to the\r\n  prejudice of the defendant.â€Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98,\r\n  107 n.2, 531 S.E.2d 287, 292 n.2,&nbsp;(2000) (emphasis added).Â  The equitable\r\n  doctrine of unclean hands, however, has no application\r\n  to an action at law.Â  E.g., Holmes v. Henderson,&nbsp;549 S.E.2d 81 (Ga. 2001); Ellwood v. Mid\r\n    States Commodities, Inc.,&nbsp;404 N.W.2d 174, 184&nbsp;(Iowa 1987).Â  Thus,\r\n  the trial court erred in applying this particular equitable defense to the\r\n  instant case because appellant was not seeking to recover in equity.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons outlined above, we reverse the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s dismissal and remand for enforcement of the California judgment.[11]\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  In my view, Appellantâ€™s repeated failure to present the Collection\r\n  Agreement amounted to extrinsic fraud, and I would therefore hold that the\r\n  trial court properly dismissed Appellantâ€™s action to enforce the California judgment.\r\nExtrinsic\r\n  fraud is fraud that induces a person not to present a case or deprives a person\r\n  of the opportunity to be heard. Â Relief is granted for extrinsic fraud on the\r\n  theory that because the fraud prevented a party from fully exhibiting and\r\n  trying his case, there has never been a real contest before the court on the\r\n  subject matter of the action.Â  Chewning\r\n    v. Ford Motor Co., 354\r\n  S.C. 72, 80, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610 (2003)\r\n  (quoting Hilton Head Ctr. of\r\n    South Carolina v. Public Serv. Commâ€™n,\r\n  294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)). On the other hand, intrinsic fraud\r\n  is fraud which was presented and considered in the trial.Â  Chewning, 354\r\n  S.C. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610.Â  It is fraud which misleads a court in\r\n  determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the\r\n  fraud.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, Appellant retained Attorney Thomas Botkin to negotiate an\r\n  assignment agreement between him and Rehon &amp; Roberts for collection of the California judgment.[12]Â \r\n  Subsequently, Botkin filed suit in Indiana on behalf of Appellant to enforce\r\n  the California judgment.Â  In the complaint, Botkin alleged that the California judgment had been assigned to Appellant, and he attached Appellantâ€™s supporting\r\n  affidavit and a copy of the Assignment as proof of his right to enforce the\r\n  judgment.Â  The Collection Agreement was never referenced in the complaint or at\r\n  any time during the Indiana litigation.Â  Likewise, in the South Carolina\r\n  complaint, Botkin[13] attached a copy of the Assignment in support of his motion to enforce the\r\n  judgment and never disclosed the existence of the Collection Agreement.Â  It was\r\n  not until 2004 following the Masterâ€™s order to compel that the Collection\r\n  Agreement was disclosed.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  my view, the evidence shows that Appellantâ€™s attorney intentionally concealed\r\n  the Collection Agreement.Â  As a result of these actions, Respondent was\r\n  prevented from fully litigating her claim that the assignment was invalid[14] during the Indiana litigation.Â  See Chewing, 354 S.C. at 84, 579 S.E.2d\r\n  at 611 (recognizing that where an\r\n  attorney embarks on a scheme to intentionally conceal documents, extrinsic\r\n  fraud constituting a fraud upon the court occurs).Â  For these reasons, I would hold that repeatedly\r\n  failing to disclose the Collection Agreement constituted extrinsic fraud, and\r\n  therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to give full faith and credit\r\n  to the Indiana judgment.Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was admitted to the California Bar in\r\n  1980.Â  Effective February 1, 2001, her status changed to inactive.Â  On July 29,\r\n  2005, respondent had disciplinary charges pending, and she tendered her\r\n  resignation.Â  Respondentâ€™s resignation became effective as of September 14,\r\n  2005. Â See http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=95447.\r\n[2] The firm was previously named Mahl Rehon Walworth\r\n  &amp; Roberts.Â  \r\n[3] Appellant subsequently deeded the house back to her\r\n  on October 5, 2001. Nonetheless, respondent filed suit against appellant in Indiana on October 11, 2001.Â  According to respondent, appellant â€œhad\r\n  misappropriated funds entrusted to him.â€Â  As of the time of trial in South Carolina, the Indiana litigation between respondent (as plaintiff) and appellant (as\r\n  defendant) was still pending.Â  Moreover, in the instant case, respondent\r\n  admitted that she encumbered the Bluffton house by mortgages despite the fact\r\n  that the Indiana court had ordered against such encumbrances. \r\n[4] Respondent declared on the name change petition that\r\n  she had â€œno intention to defraud anyone or to avoid creditors by virtue of the\r\n  name change.â€Â  The family court granted her the name change on September 24,\r\n  2001.Â  In the instant case, appellant testified that respondent told him she\r\n  was going to change her name in order to â€œdisappearâ€ and avoid her creditors.Â  \r\n[5] The California judge specifically found that\r\n  respondent â€œdeliberately refrained from obtaining information about the status\r\n  of her case.â€Â  The judge also rejected respondentâ€™s allegations that her mental\r\n  condition impaired her functioning, and noted respondent had been â€œactive in\r\n  litigation in other states, including a change of her surname, buying and\r\n  selling real estate in two different states, and significant travel.â€Â  The\r\n  judge also specifically noted that respondent had â€œthe wherewithal to transfer\r\n  the title to her late model Jaguar automobile within a few days after she\r\n  purportedly learned of the judgment against her.â€Â  \r\n[6] The assignment itself is undated, but testimony from\r\n  appellantâ€™s attorney at the South Carolina trial establishes the approximate\r\n  date of the assignment.Â  \r\n[7] The collection agreement was not disclosed in either\r\n  the California litigation or the Indiana litigation. Â In May 2004, its\r\n  production was ordered by the South Carolina court.Â  This will be further\r\n  discussed infra.\r\n[8] Respondentâ€™s counterclaims were also dismissed\r\n  because she did not oppose appellantâ€™s directed verdict motion.Â  \r\n[9] Furthermore, in the California post-judgment\r\n  litigation, respondent also claimed the Assignment was invalid.Â  \r\n[10] At most, respondentâ€™s allegations amount to\r\n  nondisclosure of a documentÂ  which generally is considered intrinsic fraud;\r\n  thus, the issue should not have been re-litigated.Â  \r\n[11] We decline to address appellantâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (an appellate court need not address additional issues if the resolution of another issue is dispositive).\r\n[12] Botkinâ€™s signature appears on the Collection Agreement.Â  \r\n[13] Botkin was admitted pro hac vice to represent Appellant in the South Carolina litigation.Â  \r\n[14] The Collection Agreement purports to disclaim any fiduciary duty between the\r\n  parties and appears to be a partial assignment, both of which are prohibited\r\n  under California law.Â  Thus, the alleged assignment upon which Appellant relied\r\n  for his authority to enforce the judgment was invalid.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26608","title":"Davie v.

Â Petitioner\r\n  primarily contends the PCR judge erred in ruling that plea counsel was not ineffective\r\n  for failing to communicate a fifteen-year plea offer made by the State.Â  We\r\n  reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s order, vacate Petitionerâ€™s sentence, and remand for re-sentencing.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nPursuant\r\n  to a plea agreement, Petitioner pled guilty in November 2000 to trafficking\r\n  crack cocaine, third offense; distribution of crack cocaine, third offense;\r\n  distribution of crack cocaine within proximity of a public park; conspiracy to\r\n  violate the South Carolina drug laws; unlawful conduct toward a child; failure\r\n  to stop for a blue light; driving under suspension, third offense; and child\r\n  endangerment.Â  In exchange for Petitionerâ€™s â€œstraight upâ€ plea, the State\r\n  agreed to dismiss additional charges.Â  At the plea hearing, the State\r\n  stipulated that the dismissal of the other charges would preclude the State\r\n  from seeking a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for\r\n  Petitioner.[1] Â The judge sentenced Petitioner to an aggregate of twenty-seven yearsâ€™\r\n  imprisonment.Â  Petitioner did not directly appeal his plea or sentence.Â  \r\nOn April 12, 2001,\r\n  Petitioner filed a PCR application.Â  In his application, Petitioner moved for\r\n  the PCR court to vacate his guilty plea and sentence on the ground the State\r\n  reneged on a twenty-five-year sentencing cap. Â In an amended application,\r\n  Petitioner raised several subject matter jurisdiction challenges to the charges\r\n  for which he pled guilty.Â  Additionally, Petitioner alleged he was denied\r\n  effective assistance of counsel on the ground his plea counsel failed to\r\n  properly advise him of the sentencing enhancements for his prior drug\r\n  offenses.Â  In an amended application dated July 31, 2002, Petitionerâ€™s PCR\r\n  counsel reiterated Petitionerâ€™s prior claims but also alleged that plea counsel\r\n  had failed to inform Petitioner of a written plea agreement in which the State\r\n  offered a fifteen-year sentence in exchange for Petitionerâ€™s plea to all of the\r\n  pending charges. \r\nAt the PCR hearing,\r\n  Petitioner testified that two years after he pled guilty he discovered the\r\n  State initially extended a plea offer of fifteen years.Â  Because plea counsel\r\n  never communicated this offer to him, Petitioner claimed ineffective assistance\r\n  of counsel.Â  Petitioner stated he would have accepted the fifteen-year deal had\r\n  he been aware of it prior to the plea proceeding.Â  \r\nPlea counsel\r\n  testified he was not aware of the Stateâ€™s offered plea agreement for a\r\n  fifteen-year sentence until after the offer had expired.  Counsel explained\r\n  he was in the process of relocating his office at the time the State mailed its\r\n  written plea offer.Â  As part of the office relocation, counsel stated he\r\n  acquired a new post office box.Â  Had he been aware of the offer, counsel\r\n  claimed he would have communicated it to Petitioner.Â  Counsel believed\r\n  Petitioner would have accepted the plea offer had it been communicated to him. Counsel\r\n  further testified that the only subsequent offer was the one Petitioner\r\n  accepted at his plea hearing, wherein Petitioner pled â€œstraight upâ€ to the\r\n  eight charges in return for the State dropping the remaining three charges and\r\n  seeking a sentence of life without parole. \r\nAt the conclusion\r\n  of the PCR hearing, Petitionerâ€™s counsel argued that plea counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  communicate the plea offer to Petitioner constituted ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel.Â  In terms of relief, counsel requested the PCR court remand the case\r\n  for a re-sentencing hearing with the directive that the new sentence could not\r\n  exceed the twenty-seven-year sentence that was previously imposed.Â  \r\nThe judge denied\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s request for relief, finding â€œno proof of ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel regarding the unfortunate circumstances, which caused a plea offer to\r\n  lapse prior to [Petitionerâ€™s] consideration of the same.â€ Â The judge stated it\r\n  was â€œunfortunateâ€ that Petitioner did not have the opportunity to consider the\r\n  fifteen-year plea offer.Â  However, the judge noted the offer was not available\r\n  to Petitioner at the time of his guilty plea.Â  Additionally, the judge found\r\n  Petitioner knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty given he was fully advised of\r\n  the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty and he understood the underlying\r\n  charges of his guilty plea.Â  The judge also concluded Petitioner ultimately\r\n  benefited from the Stateâ€™s agreement by avoiding a sentence of life without\r\n  parole.[2]Â  \r\nThe Court granted\r\n  the Petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner\r\n  contends his plea counsel was ineffective in failing to communicate the Stateâ€™s\r\n  initial fifteen-year plea offer to him.Â  Because he would have accepted the\r\n  offer, Petitioner asserts he was prejudiced by counselâ€™s deficient performance.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  This Court has held that a defendant has the right to\r\n  effective assistance of counsel during the plea bargaining process.Â  Judge\r\n    v. State, 321 S.C. 554, 471 S.E.2d 146 (1996), overruled on other\r\n      grounds by Jackson v. State, 342 S.C. 95, 535 S.E.2d 926\r\n  (2000).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate\r\n  assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all\r\n  significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331,\r\n  642 S.E.2d 590, 596, cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).Â Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  â€œIn the context of a guilty plea, the court must determine\r\n  whether 1) counselâ€™s advice was within the range of competence demanded of\r\n  attorneys in criminal cases- i.e. was counselâ€™s performance deficient, and 2)\r\n  if there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the\r\n  defendant would not have pled guilty.â€ Smith v. State, 369 S.C. 135,\r\n  138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006) (citing Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-58 (1985)). Â â€œThe\r\n  defendantâ€™s undisputed testimony that he would not have pled guilty to the\r\n  charges but for trial counselâ€™s advice is sufficient to prove that defendant\r\n  would not have pled guilty.â€Â  Id. at 138, 631 S.E.2d at 261.Â  â€œIn\r\n  determining guilty plea issues, it is proper to consider\r\n  the guilty plea transcript as well as evidence at the PCR\r\n  hearing.â€ Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s findings\r\n  of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 368,\r\n  610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  In\r\n  reviewing the PCR courtâ€™s decision, an appellate court is concerned only with\r\n  whether any evidence of probative value exists to support that decision.&nbsp; Smith,\r\n  369 S.C. at 138, 631 S.E.2d at 261.Â  This Court will uphold the findings of the\r\n  PCR court when there is any evidence of probative value to support them, and\r\n  will reverse the decision of the PCR court when it is controlled by an\r\n  error&nbsp;of law.&nbsp; Suber, 371 S.C. at 558-59, 640 S.E.2d at 886.\r\nTo\r\n  prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner was\r\n  required to prove that 1) plea counselâ€™s failure to communicate the Stateâ€™s\r\n  initial, fifteen-year plea offer constituted deficient performance, and 2) he\r\n  was prejudiced by this deficient performance, i.e., there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that but for counselâ€™s deficient performance, he would\r\n  have accepted the original plea offer. \r\nDeficient Performance\r\nAlthough\r\n  our appellate courts have not directly addressed the question of whether\r\n  counselâ€™s failure to communicate a plea offer to his or her client constitutes\r\n  deficient performance, other cases of deficient performance in the context of\r\n  plea bargaining would appear to support Petitionerâ€™s position.Â  See, e.g., Sprouse v. State, 355 S.C. 335, 340, 585 S.E.2d 278, 281 (2003) (finding\r\n  defendant was entitled to post-conviction relief where the State failed to\r\n  honor the plea agreement it made with defendant and trial counsel failed\r\n  to ensure that the State adhered to the original plea agreement); Thompson\r\n    v. State, 340 S.C. 112, 116-17, 531 S.E.2d 294, 296-97 (2000) (concluding\r\n  defendant established a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel where trial\r\n  counsel failed to object when the solicitor recommended the maximum sentence in\r\n  violation of the plea agreement); Jordan v. State, 297 S.C. 52, 53-54,\r\n  374 S.E.2d 683, 684-85 (1988) (holding trial counsel rendered ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel in failing to withdraw guilty plea after State reneged on\r\n  plea, and reasoning that counselâ€™s conduct in not protecting defendantâ€™s right\r\n  to enforce the plea agreement with the solicitorâ€™s office fell below â€œprevailing\r\n  professional normsâ€).\r\nBecause\r\n  our appellate courts have not specifically ruled on this issue, we are guided\r\n  by the decisions of other state and federal jurisdictions.Â  As we view these\r\n  cases, we believe an adoption of a rule that counselâ€™s failure to convey a plea\r\n  offer constitutes deficient performance would be consistent with the majority of\r\n  other state and federal jurisdictions.Â  The theory underlying these decisions\r\n  is that such conduct constitutes unreasonable performance under the prevailing\r\n  professional standards established by the American Bar Association or\r\n  state-specific ethical rules of conduct.Â  Pursuant to these professional\r\n  standards, counsel is required to fully communicate with the client so that the\r\n  client can make an informed decision regarding any proposals by the State.Â  See United States v.

Sarno, Annotation, Adequacy of Defense Counselâ€™s Representation of\r\n    Criminal Client Regarding Plea Bargaining, 8 A.L.R. 4th 660 (1981 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2008) (discussing state and federal decisions determining the adequacy,\r\n  competency, or effectiveness of defense counselâ€™s representation of a criminal\r\n  accused in connection with plea bargaining and negotiating).\r\nTurning\r\n  to the facts of the instant case, we find that plea counselâ€™s failure to convey\r\n  the Stateâ€™s initial plea offer to Petitioner constituted deficient\r\n  performance.Â  Although counselâ€™s failure to do so could be construed as\r\n  excusable neglect if one believes that the Stateâ€™s written offer was truly lost\r\n  in the process of counselâ€™s office relocation, we do not believe that such\r\n  neglect would negate the deficient performance.Â  Even if counsel is given the\r\n  benefit of the doubt that he was not aware of the plea offer until after the\r\n  expiration date, we find counsel was deficient in not objecting at the plea\r\n  hearing.Â  During the plea hearing, the solicitor informed the circuit court\r\n  judge that â€œ[t]he original plea offer in this matter has not been accepted by\r\n  the due date of September 11th of this year, and so we told the defendant we\r\n  were ready to go to trial.â€Â  In view of the solicitorâ€™s statement, it was\r\n  incumbent upon plea counsel to object or in some way indicate to the court that\r\n  he had no knowledge of the original plea offer.Â  Had counsel done so, he might\r\n  have been able to convince the solicitor to reinstate this plea offer or\r\n  persuade the circuit court judge to impose a fifteen-year sentence.Â  Because\r\n  counsel failed to make any attempt to protect Petitionerâ€™s interests regarding\r\n  this significantly lower sentence, we conclude counselâ€™s performance fell below\r\n  the prevailing professional norms and, thus, constituted deficient performance.\r\nPrejudice\r\nGiven\r\n  our finding that plea counselâ€™s failure to communicate the Stateâ€™s initial plea\r\n  offer constituted deficient performance, the question becomes whether\r\n  Petitioner was prejudiced by this deficient performance.Â  We believe this is\r\n  the most difficult question of the analysis because a definitive method of\r\n  evaluating the prejudice prong does not appear to exist in our state or other\r\n  jurisdictions.Â  Although most state courts follow the traditional, two-part Strickland test, differences appear to arise in what type of evidence must be presented to\r\n  establish prejudice.\r\nSome\r\n  state courts have not required the defendant to present additional evidence.Â \r\n  Instead, the courts have essentially presumed prejudice merely based on the\r\n  fact that plea counsel failed to communicate a plea offer.Â  These courts have\r\n  reasoned that counselâ€™s failure to communicate a plea offer, whatever the\r\n  terms, was inherently prejudicial because the deficient conduct prevented the\r\n  defendant from making an informed decision. Â See, e.g.,Â  State v.\r\n    Simmons, 309 S.E.2d 493, 498 (N.C. Ct. App. 1983) (concluding defendant was\r\n  â€œclearly prejudiced by his attorneyâ€™s failure to inform him of the [plea\r\n  bargain] offerâ€); Harris v. State, 875 S.W.2d 662, 665 (Tenn. 1994)\r\n  (â€œThere is no doubt that the prejudice suffered by defendant was the direct\r\n  result of failure on the part of defense counsel to discuss the plea bargain\r\n  offer with his client and his failure to respond timely to the Stateâ€™s offer.â€); State v. James, 739 P.2d 1161, 1167 (Wash. Ct. App. 1987) (â€œIf we were\r\n  presented with a finding, supported by substantial evidence, that in fact\r\n  [counsel] failed to convey the plea negotiation to his clients, we would have\r\n  no hesitation in concluding they were denied effective assistance of counsel on\r\n  this error alone.â€).\r\nOther\r\n  state courts have found prejudice based on the defendantâ€™s self-serving\r\n  statements that he would have accepted the plea offer had he been made aware of\r\n  it.Â  See, e.g., People v. Culpepper, 567 N.Y.S.2d 327, 328 (N.Y. App.\r\n  Div. 1990) (finding no prejudice where defendant did not say that â€œhe would\r\n  have accepted the alleged plea offer if it had been transmittedâ€).\r\nIn\r\n  contrast, other courts have utilized a burden of proof that is seemingly higher\r\n  and requires objective evidence to show prejudice.Â  In these cases, the\r\n  defendant must show not only that he would have accepted the offer, but also\r\n  that he would have received a lesser sentence than that which he received or\r\n  acted differently had he been aware of the plea offer. Â See, e.g., Cottle\r\n    v. State, 733 So. 2d 963, 967 (Fla. 1999) (â€œ[C]ourts in this state have\r\n  recognized claims arising out of counselâ€™s failure to inform a defendant of a\r\n  plea offer, and have required a claimant to show that:Â  (1) counsel failed to\r\n  communicate a plea offer . . ., (2) defendant would have accepted the plea\r\n  offer but for the inadequate notice, and (3) acceptance of the Stateâ€™s plea\r\n  offer would have resulted in a lesser sentence.â€); Williams v. State,\r\n  605 A.2d 103, 110 (Md. 1992) (holding evidence of prejudice was â€œampleâ€ where\r\n  the inference was supported by â€œobjective evidenceâ€ that the outcome would have\r\n  been different had petitioner accepted the Stateâ€™s plea offer); Commonwealth\r\n    v. Copeland, 554 A.2d 54, 61 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988) (vacating defendantâ€™s\r\n  sentence and remanding for an evidentiary hearing during which defendant would\r\n  have the burden of proving that:Â  (1) an offer for a plea was made; (2) trial\r\n  counsel failed to inform him of such offer; (3) trial counsel had no reasonable\r\n  basis for failing to inform him of the plea offer; and (4) he was prejudiced\r\n  thereby); cf. State v. Lopez, 743 N.W.2d 351, 358 (Neb. 2008)\r\n  (defendant failed to establish that she was prejudiced by counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  communicate offer of plea agreement where defendantâ€™s claims were contradicted\r\n  by evidence introduced by the State and defense counsel). Â Â \r\nFinally,\r\n  some jurisdictions have declined to adopt a definitive rule and, instead,\r\n  advocated a case-by-case analysis looking strictly at the facts of each case. See,\r\n    e.g., Lloyd v. State, 373 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ga. 1988) (finding defendant\r\n  was not prejudiced by counselâ€™s deficient performance, and stating â€œ[w]e prefer\r\n  to examine the facts of each case and grant relief where there is at least an\r\n  inference from the evidence that the defendant would have accepted the offer as\r\n  made or something similarâ€); Hanzelka v. State, 682 S.W.2d 385, 387 (Tex. Ct. App. 1984) (â€œThis Court has concluded further that counselâ€™s deficient performance\r\n  prejudiced Hanzelka in that under the terms of the plea bargain he would not\r\n  have served any time in jail.â€). Â \r\nWe\r\n  find a case-by-case approach is most consistent with our prior decisions and\r\n  effectively achieves the ultimate goal of assessing whether but for counselâ€™s\r\n  deficient performance a defendant would have accepted the Stateâ€™s proposed plea\r\n  bargain and that he would have benefited from the offer.Â  Because presumed\r\n  prejudice is reserved to very limited situations, we hold that a defendant must\r\n  show actual prejudice.Â  See Nance v. Ozmint, 367 S.C. 547, 552,\r\n  626 S.E.2d 878, 880 (2006) (â€œAbsent [three narrow circumstances of presumed\r\n  prejudice identified in United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984)],\r\n  defendants must show actual prejudice under Strickland.â€).Â Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  it is not always necessary for a defendant to offer objective evidence to\r\n  support a claim of actual prejudice.Â  Instead, depending on the facts of the\r\n  case, a defendantâ€™s self-serving statement may be sufficient to establish\r\n  actual prejudice.Â  See Jackson v. State, 342 S.C. 95, 97, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 926, 927 (2000) (rejecting objective evidence requirement established in Judge and finding Petitioner proved he was prejudiced by counselâ€™s\r\n  deficient performance in failing to properly advise the Petitioner that he was\r\n  pleading to a felony rather than a misdemeanor where Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  uncontradicted testimony established that he would not have pled had he known\r\n  the charge was a felony), overruling Judge v. State, 321 S.C.\r\n  554, 562, 471 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1996) (â€œThe second prong of the ineffective assistance inquiry--prejudice--is\r\n  shown by demonstrating through objective evidence . . . [the existence\r\n  of] a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s advice, [the defendant]\r\n  would have accepted the plea. Â Mere statements by the PCR petitioner that he\r\n  would have accepted the plea agreement but for counselâ€™s incompetence are\r\n  insufficient to show prejudice because they are self-serving and inherently\r\n  unreliable.â€) (citation omitted); see also Smith v. State,\r\n  369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006) (â€œThe defendantâ€™s undisputed\r\n  testimony that he would not have pled guilty to the charges but for trial\r\n  counselâ€™s advice is sufficient to prove that defendant would not have pled\r\n  guilty.â€). \r\nApplying these\r\n  principles to the facts of the instant case, we conclude that Petitioner has\r\n  proven he was prejudiced by plea counselâ€™s deficient performance.Â  Initially,\r\n  we conclude that the difference in the sentence Petitioner received and the\r\n  plea offer is proof of prejudice.Â  We reach this conclusion for several\r\n  reasons.Â  First, the solicitor and plea counsel both acknowledged that the State\r\n  originally offered a fifteen-year sentence in exchange for Petitionerâ€™s guilty\r\n  plea.Â  Secondly, plea counsel admitted that he failed to communicate this offer\r\n  to Petitioner.Â  Thirdly, both plea counsel and Petitioner testified that had\r\n  this offer been communicated Petitioner would have accepted the plea\r\n  agreement.Â  Finally, had Petitioner accepted the original offer, he would have\r\n  received a significantly lower sentence than the twenty-seven-year sentence\r\n  that was imposed.\r\nRemedy\r\nIn\r\n  light of our holding that Petitioner has established ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel, the final issue to be resolved is the relief to which Petitioner is\r\n  entitled.Â  Notably, Petitioner has not set forth a specific request for relief\r\n  in his brief.Â  However, a review of his PCR applications and the PCR hearing indicates\r\n  that Petitioner appears to seek relief in the form of a new sentencing\r\n  hearing.Â  As will be discussed, we agree that a re-sentencing hearing is the\r\n  appropriate form of relief.\r\nIn\r\n  formulating the appropriate relief, we are guided by general constitutional principles.\r\n  Â Confronted with the issue presented in the instant case, the Kentucky Court of\r\n  Appeals explained:\r\n\r\n\tRemedies for ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel â€œâ€˜should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional\r\n  violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.â€™â€ Turner\r\n    v. Tennessee, 858 F.2d 1201, 1207 (6th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 502\r\n  U.S. 1050, 112 S. Ct. 915, 116 L.Ed.2d 815 (1992) (quoting United States v.\r\n    Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 354, 101 S. Ct. 665, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981)) . . . â€œIndeed,\r\n  the only way to neutralize the constitutional deprivation suffered by [a\r\n  defendant] would seem to be to provide [the defendant] with an opportunity to\r\n  consider the [Commonwealthâ€™s initial] plea offer with the effective assistance\r\n  of counsel.â€ Turner, 858 F.2d at 1208. \r\n\tThe United States\r\n  Supreme Court has expressed that specific performance of a plea agreement is an\r\n  allowable remedy where one has been denied constitutionally-guaranteed\r\n  effective assistance of counsel.

(Citation omitted).\r\n\tIt has been\r\n  clearly established that when a criminal defendant successfully achieves\r\n  relief, either through a direct or collateral attack to the conviction, he â€œmay\r\n  not be subjected to greater punishment for exercising that right.â€ Id. at 1208 (Citing \r\n\tBlackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 94 S. Ct. 2098, 40\r\n  L.Ed.2d 628 (1974)). The rebuttable presumption of vindictiveness is valid\r\n  where there is a â€œrealistic likelihoodâ€ of prosecutorial retaliation. In\r\n  ascertaining the existence of a realistic likelihood, the â€œcourts should focus\r\n  on â€˜the nature of the right assertedâ€™ and â€˜the timing of the prosecutorâ€™s\r\n  action.â€™â€ Turner, 858 F.2d at 1208 (quoting United States v. Goodwin,\r\n  457 U.S. 368, 381-82, 102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982)).\r\n\r\nOsborne v.\r\n  Commonwealth, 992 S.W.2d\r\n  860, 865 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).\r\nBecause there is\r\n  no evidence in the record that Petitioner expressed a desire to proceed to\r\n  trial rather than plead guilty, we find a remand for a new trial is not the\r\n  appropriate remedy.Â  See United States v. Blaylock, 20 F.3d 1458,\r\n  1468 (9th Cir. 1994) (â€œSeveral\r\n  courts have recognized that where the ineffective assistance occurred before trial, as in cases where the harm consisted in defense counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  communicate a plea offer to defendant, . . . [granting a] subsequent fair trial\r\n  does not remedy this deprivation.â€) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nFurthermore, given\r\n  Petitioner was never apprised of the plea offer, we do not believe that\r\n  specific performance would be the appropriate remedy in that Petitioner did not\r\n  detrimentally rely on the offer.Â Â  Cf. Custodio v. State, 373\r\n  S.C. 4, 13, 644 S.E.2d 36, 40 (2007) (finding counsel rendered ineffective\r\n  assistance in failing to have plea agreement enforced and concluding the\r\n  appropriate remedy was specific performance of the plea agreement because\r\n  defendant detrimentally relied on the promised plea agreement); Sprouse v.\r\n    State, 355 S.C. 335, 340, 585 S.E.2d 278, 281 (2003) (holding counsel was\r\n  ineffective in failing to ensure that the State adhered to the original plea\r\n  agreement and remanding for specific performance of the plea agreement given it\r\n  would grant â€œthe parties nothing more and nothing less than the benefit for\r\n  which they originally bargainedâ€).Â  Accordingly, we hold that the appropriate\r\n  remedy is a new sentencing hearing.\r\nGiven\r\n  that we cannot compel the State to reinstate or the circuit court judge to\r\n  accept the original, fifteen-year plea offer, we remand the case for a new\r\n  sentencing hearing with the limitation that Petitionerâ€™s sentence should not\r\n  exceed the original sentence of twenty-seven yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  See Commonwealth v. Copeland, 554 A.2d 54, 61 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988) (â€œWe\r\n  cannot compel the Commonwealth to reinstate its plea bargain offer; nor can we\r\n  dictate what sentence may be imposed if appellant pleads guilty without so\r\n  advantageous an offer as he had before, or if he goes to trial and is again\r\n  convicted.â€).\r\nThe\r\n  State and the circuit court judge should take into consideration the prior fifteen-year\r\n  plea offer. Â See Harris v. State, 974 So. 2d 1149, 1151 (Fla.\r\n  Dist. Ct. App. 2008) (concluding that, if on remand, counsel is found to have\r\n  been ineffective in failing to properly advise defendant prior to revocation\r\n  then there should be a â€œgood faith resumption of plea negotiationsâ€); Lyles\r\n    v. State, 382 N.E.2d 991, 994 (Ind. Ct. App. 1978) (holding counsel was\r\n  ineffective in failing to convey Stateâ€™s plea bargain offer and remanding â€œwith\r\n  instructions to conduct a guilty plea hearing, assuming, as equity indicates\r\n  under the limited facts of this case, the Stateâ€™s offer continuesâ€); Becton\r\n    v. Hun, 516 S.E.2d 762, 768 (W.Va. 1999) (finding counsel was ineffective\r\n  in failing to convey Stateâ€™s plea offer and remanding for a new sentencing\r\n  hearing, but recognizing that the trial court would not be bound by the Stateâ€™s\r\n  original sentencing recommendation).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find that counsel was deficient in failing to communicate\r\n  the Stateâ€™s fifteen-year plea offer to Petitioner.Â  Given that both Petitioner\r\n  and plea counsel testified Petitioner would have accepted the fifteen-year\r\n  offer, an offer that was twelve years less than what Petitioner received, we\r\n  conclude Petitioner has proven that he was prejudiced by counselâ€™s deficient\r\n  performance.Â  Accordingly, we vacate Petitionerâ€™s sentence and remand for a\r\n  re-sentencing hearing.Â  In re-sentencing Petitioner, the circuit court judge shall\r\n  take into consideration the Stateâ€™s prior fifteen-year plea offer.Â  We further\r\n  direct that any sentence Petitioner receives should not exceed the original\r\n  twenty-seven-year sentence.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nWALLER and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

Â Petitioner was\r\n  alleged to be the shooter. Â Because Petitioner was seventeen at the time, he\r\n  was further charged with possession of a pistol under the age of twenty-one.Â  A\r\n  week following the January 21st shooting incident, a search of Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  residence yielded a pistol.Â  The handgun seized from Petitionerâ€™s residence was\r\n  in no manner connected to the shooting incident at Voorhees College.Â  Moreover, Petitioner was not charged with underage possession of the pistol seized\r\n  from his residence.Â  We are troubled by the Stateâ€™s effort to admit the\r\n  unrelated firearm in evidence.Â  More troubling is Petitionerâ€™s trial counselâ€™s\r\n  failure to object to the admission of the unrelated pistol.\r\nWe\r\n  hold that the failure to object to this clearly inadmissible evidence was\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  We reject the suggestion that the failure\r\n  to object to the unrelated pistol can be justified as a valid trial strategy.Â  Whitehead\r\n    v. State, 308 S.C. 119, 122, 417 S.E.2d 529, 531 (1992) (â€œCourts must be wary\r\n  of second-guessing counselâ€™s trial tactics; and where counsel articulates a\r\n  valid reason for employing certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.â€).Â  Substantial, and easily avoidable,\r\n  prejudice resulted from Petitionerâ€™s failure to challenge the admission of the\r\n  firearm unconnected to the charged offenses.Â  State v. McConnell, 290\r\n  S.C. 278, 280, 350 S.E.2d 179, 180 (1986) (holding the admission of bullets and\r\n  a pistol unconnected to the crime was erroneous and prejudicial).\r\nThe\r\n  admission of this irrelevant and prejudicial evidence undermines confidence in\r\n  the outcome of the trial. Â Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  590, 596 (2007) (â€œ[The prejudice prong is satisfied when] there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have\r\n  been different.Â  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\r\n  undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.â€) (internal citations\r\n  omitted); Von Dohlen v. State, 360 S.C. 598, 603, 602 S.E.2d 738, 740-41\r\n  (2004) (â€œIn order to prove counsel was ineffective, the applicant must show\r\n  that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have\r\n  been different.Â  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\r\n  the outcome of the trial.â€).Â  As both the deficient performance and prejudice\r\n  prongs are satisfied, we hold trial counsel was ineffective.Â  Strickland v.

Mill, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  We granted a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Temple v. Tec-Fab, Inc,\r\n  370 S.C. 383, 635 S.E.2d 541 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The issue on certiorari is\r\n  whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing an award of treble damages for\r\n  a violation of the Payment of Wages Act.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part,\r\n  and remand to the trial court.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nTemple was employed\r\n  at Tec-Fab, Inc., a metal fabrication company in York County, for a salary of\r\n  $5000 per month.Â  In December 2000, Temple purchased a 15% ownership interest\r\n  in the company from Tec-Fabâ€™s president and sole shareholder, Richard Lytle.Â  Temple became corporate vice-president and ran the company on a daily basis; his salary\r\n  was increased to $6000 per month.Â  Temple remained employed by Tec-Fab until\r\n  February 2003, at which time he was fired by Lytle.Â  The letter of termination\r\n  advised Temple he would receive back pay upon receipt of money from Accutron, a\r\n  Tec-Fab customer, in one month.\r\nTemple filed a\r\n  complaint in April 2003, alleging Tec-Fab failed to pay his monthly wages for\r\n  the months of September, October, November, and half of December 2002, as well\r\n  as February 2003, thereby owing him back wages.Â  The complaint sought treble\r\n  damages under the Payment of Wages Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-10 to -110\r\n  (1986 &amp; Supp. 2005). \r\nTec-Fab and Lytle\r\n  answered and counterclaimed, alleging Temple 1) had failed to remit to it\r\n  $15,000 in payments he had received from Accutron, 2) had failed to return a\r\n  truck owned by Tec-Fab, and 3) had kept $5114 in proceeds from the sale of\r\n  scrap metal which was owed to Tec-Fab.Â  At trial, Temple admitted he had kept\r\n  some of the proceeds from the sale of scrap metal, such that the master ruled\r\n  Tec-Fab was entitled to a set-off of $5114 against the back-wages owed.Â  Based\r\n  on Lytleâ€™s testimony that he told Temple subsequent to his firing that he could\r\n  keep the Tec-Fab truck if he assumed the liability on it (which was\r\n  $20,568.30), the circuit court found there was no conversion of the vehicle nor\r\n  any set-off required.Â  \r\nThe trial court further\r\n  ruled Temple was entitled to the gross amount of his back wages, totaling\r\n  $27,500.00, which was then reduced by the $5114 scrap metal proceeds.[1]Â Â \r\n  The masterâ€™s order goes on to state that the gross sum of $22,385.75 â€œwill\r\n    be trebled as required by statute, giving a total award of wages to\r\n  Plaintiff of $67,157.25.â€Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  Temple was also awarded\r\n  $7069.50 in costs and attorneys fees.Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed the award of treble damages, finding the circuit court\r\n  committed an error of law in concluding the statute mandated trebling.Â  It\r\n  further held, after a review of the record on appeal, that there was a bona\r\n  fide dispute over the wages in question.Â  It therefore modified Templeâ€™s award to $22,385.75 (Templeâ€™s gross unpaid wages less the $5,114.25 withheld in\r\n  company proceeds). \r\nISSUE\r\nThe sole issue on\r\n  certiorari is whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the award of\r\n  treble damages to Temple?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn an action at law\r\n  tried without a jury, an appellate courtâ€™s scope of review extends merely to\r\n  the correction of errors of law.Â  The Court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  findings unless they are found to be without evidence that reasonably supports\r\n  those findings. Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81,\r\n  86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals held the circuit courtâ€™s ruling was controlled by an error of law,\r\n  inasmuch as the trial court held the statute required the imposition of\r\n  treble damages.Â  We agree. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  41-10-80(c) states, â€œ[i]n case of any failure to pay wages due to an employee\r\n  as required by Section 41-10-40 or 41-10-50 the employee may recover in a civil\r\n  action an amount equal to three times the full amount of the unpaid wages, plus\r\n  costs and reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees as the court may allow.â€Â  The language of\r\n  Â§ 41-10-80(c) is discretionary and not mandatory.Â  In Rice v. Multimedia,\r\n    Inc., 318 S.C. 95, 98, 456 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1995), we held that â€œ[t]he\r\n  imposition of treble damages in those cases where there is a bona fide dispute\r\n  would be unjust and harsh.â€Â  The Court went on to note:\r\n\r\n\t[T]here\r\n  are some wage disputes when the issue may involve a valid close question of law\r\n  or fact which should properly be decided by the courts. We do not believe the\r\n  legislature intended to deter the litigation of reasonable good faith wage\r\n  disputes; we do believe the legislature intended to punish the employer who\r\n  forces the employee to resort to the court in an unreasonable or bad faith wage\r\n  dispute.\r\n\r\nId. at 99, 456 S.E.2d at 384.Â  A finding that an employee\r\n  is entitled to recover unpaid wages is not equivalent to a finding that there\r\n  existed no bona fide dispute as to the employeeâ€™s entitlement to those wages.Â  Oâ€™Neal\r\n    v. Intermedical Hosp. of South Carolina, 355 S.C. 499, 585 S.E.2d 526 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2003).Â  Accord Futch v. McAlister, 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591 (1999) (employee was not entitled to treble damages under Payment of Wages\r\n  Act in light of bona fide dispute as to whether employer owed any wages based\r\n  on employeeâ€™s alleged disloyalty).\r\nAlthough we agree\r\n  with the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling that the trial judgeâ€™s award of treble\r\n  damages was controlled by an error of law, we find it was for the trial court\r\n  to determine, in the first instance, whether there existed a bona fide dispute\r\n  such that treble damages were not warranted.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122,\r\n    124 (1991) (Court of Appeals should\r\n  not address an issue which was not explicitly ruled on below).Â  Accordingly, to\r\n  the extent the Court of Appeals ruled on this question, its opinion is reversed\r\n  and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further consideration.Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.[2]Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The master ordered the record re-opened to\r\n  ascertain the amount of scrap metal proceeds retained by Temple unless he\r\n  consented to the amount of $5114, as stated by Tec-Fab; Temple consented.Â  This\r\n  was an amended order; the original order indicated Temple was entitled to net,\r\n  rather than gross wages.\r\n[2] Â The parties assert that the Court of Appeals\r\n  also reversed the award of attorneys fees and costs; we find no language to\r\n  this effect in the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.Â Â  The trial court is directed to\r\n  address this issue on remand and may award attorneys fees and costs in its\r\n  discretion.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26611","title":"Jordan v.

App. filed January 11, 2007).Â \r\n  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We\r\n  affirm\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\n\r\nPetitioner\r\n  Thomas Jordan was employed as a driver by Respondent Kelly Company, Inc., a\r\n  hauling company specializing in transporting heavy equipment.Â  On January 11,\r\n  2003, following the completion of a long haul route from Virginia to Texas, Petitioner suffered a heart attack.Â  Petitioner filed a claim for workersâ€™\r\n  compensation benefits and alleged that the heart attack was proximately caused\r\n  by unusual and extraordinary duties during this haul.\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, Petitioner testified that on Wednesday, January 8, 2003, Kelly\r\n  Company sent him to pick up a large piece of equipment in Virginia and\r\n  transport it to Texas by Friday, January 10, 2003.Â  Because the equipment had\r\n  not been loaded, Petitioner departed seven hours past schedule, leaving him\r\n  only two hours of travel time on Wednesday.[1]Â \r\n  Additionally, Petitioner testified that the required permits were not ready for\r\n  him when he left Virginia and he therefore had to drive without the permits\r\n  until he could pick up copies at a truck stop.Â  On Thursday, Petitioner drove\r\n  from North Carolina to Alabama, and on Friday he drove from Alabama to Louisiana.Â  Petitioner informed a dispatcher that he would not be able to deliver the\r\n  equipment to Texas by the Friday deadline, but the dispatcher informed\r\n  Petitioner that the deadline was extended to 12:00 p.m. Saturday.Â  When\r\n  Petitioner arrived in Texas on Saturday morning, he was unable to take the exit\r\n  that his permit required him to take because the exit was under construction.Â \r\n  As a result, he had to deviate from his route through downtown Houston.Â  Petitioner made the delivery at 11:57.Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  testified that he began experiencing symptoms associated with a heart attack\r\n  during the haul and on Saturday night.Â  He further testified that the haul was\r\n  extremely stressful because he was forced to leave Virginia and travel without\r\n  the required permits and to drive illegally through downtown Houston without a\r\n  special permit or police escort.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  single commissioner found that Petitionerâ€™s heart attack was precipitated by\r\n  unusual and extraordinary conditions of his employment on the trip.Â  The full\r\n  commission reversed and found that Petitioner was performing his job duties as\r\n  a long haul driver in the ordinary and usual manner.Â  The circuit court\r\n  reversed the full commissionâ€™s decision and reinstated the award of benefits.Â \r\n  The court of appeals reversed the circuit court and held that that substantial\r\n  evidence in the record supported the full commissionâ€™s decision denying\r\n  benefits.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  granted Petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari to review the court of\r\n  appealsâ€™ decision, and Petitioner presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  court of appeals err in finding substantial evidence in the record exists to\r\n  support the full commissionâ€™s findings?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the full commission is the\r\n  ultimate fact finder.Â Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341\r\n  S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  This Court must affirm the findings of\r\n  fact made by the full commission if they are supported by substantial evidence.\r\n  Â Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981). Â Substantial\r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering\r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the\r\n  agency reached. Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d\r\n  843, 845 (1999).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues\r\n  that the court of appeals erred in holding that substantial evidence in the\r\n  record exists to support the full commissionâ€™s findings.Â  We disagree.\r\nA claimant may recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits if he sustains an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the\r\n  course of the employment.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (2006).Â  The general rule is that a heart attack is\r\n  compensable as a workerâ€™s compensation accident if it is induced by unexpected\r\n  strain or overexertion in the performance of the duties of a claimantâ€™s\r\n  employment or by unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  Hoxit\r\n    v. Michelin Tire Corp., 304 S.C. 461, 464, 405 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1991).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  our view, the court of appeals correctly held that substantial evidence in the\r\n  record supported the full commissionâ€™s finding that Petitioner\r\n  was not performing his job duties under unusual or extraordinary conditions of\r\n  his employment.Â  Although Petitioner testified that the haul was extremely\r\n  stressful, Petitionerâ€™s boss and co-worker testified that the Kelly Company\r\n  did not impose deadlines and that it was not unusual for employees to deviate\r\n  from their routes due to construction.Â  Petitioner admitted that he had left without permits on prior deliveries and that when this\r\n  would happen, he would pick up a faxed copy of the permits at the nearest truck\r\n  stop.Â  Furthermore, evidence in the record showed that Petitioner smoked\r\n  cigarettes, had abused alcohol, suffered from high blood pressure, and had a\r\n  family history of heart disease.Â  \r\nAlthough the record contains conflicting evidence, this Court is\r\n  not in a position to weigh the evidence presented in workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  hearing.Â  See Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442 (holding that the final determination of\r\n  witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the\r\n  full commission, and it is not the task of an appellate court to weigh the\r\n  evidence as found by the full commission).Â  Accordingly, we hold that\r\n  substantial evidence in the record supports the full commissionâ€™s finding that\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s heart attack was not induced by unexpected strain or overexertion\r\n  in the performance of the duties of his employment or by unusual and\r\n  extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™\r\n  decision denying benefits.Â Â  \r\nWALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner testified that drivers are only allowed to transport heavy equipment\r\n  during daylight hours.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26612","title":"RRR, Inc. v.

Johnson, III, of Johnson &amp; Barnette, LLP, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Petitioner filed\r\n  a legal malpractice action against respondents.Â  The trial judge granted respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment\r\n  on the issue of whether respondents owed petitioner a fiduciary duty with\r\n  respect to a congressional life insurance policy issued to petitionerâ€™s late\r\n  husband.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding the issue was not preserved\r\n  for review.Â  Spence v. Wingate, 378 S.C. 486, 663 S.E.2d 70 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, dispense with further\r\n  briefing, reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion, and remand the matter to the\r\n  Court of Appeals for a ruling on the merits of petitionerâ€™s arguments.\r\nAt the\r\n  hearing on respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment, respondents argued they\r\n  were entitled to summary judgment because there existed no attorney-client\r\n  relationship between respondents and petitioner; therefore, respondents owed no\r\n  duty to petitioner.Â  Petitioner countered that she was a former client of\r\n  respondents, and maintained respondents owed her a fiduciary duty based on the relationship.Â \r\n  The trial judge granted summary judgment, finding respondents â€œowed no duty or\r\n  obligationâ€ to petitioner.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals held the issue was not preserved for review because petitioner\r\n  failed to file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals found the argument was not preserved because the trial judge\r\n  did not mention petitionerâ€™s alternative theory of liability that, as a former\r\n  client of respondents, she had a continuing fiduciary relationship with\r\n  respondents.Â  \r\nWe hold\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in finding the issue was not preserved for appeal.Â  The\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s order granted respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment on precisely the grounds argued by respondents at the summary judgment hearing.Â  While that\r\n  order did not restate the ground on which petitioner opposed the motion - a\r\n  duty based on the existence of a prior attorney-client relationship - the order\r\n  explicitly addresses that argument by ruling respondents â€œowed no duty or\r\n  obligationâ€ to petitioner.Â  This ruling is sufficient to preserve petitionerâ€™s\r\n  argument that respondents owed a duty to petitioner, and petitioner was not\r\n  required to file a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend in order to preserve the\r\n  issue for appeal.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338\r\n  S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (holding that, if the losing party\r\n  has raised an issue in the lower court, but the court fails to rule upon it,\r\n  the party must file a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment in order\r\n  to preserve the issue for appellate review).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the Court of Appeals erred in finding the issue was not preserved for\r\n  review, and we remand the matter to the Court of Appeals for a ruling on the\r\n  merits.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, BEATTY, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur; TOAL, C.J., and\r\n  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26614","title":"In the Matter of Michael T.

Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\t\t\t\tJ.\r\n  Steedley Bogan, of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any\r\n  sanction provided for in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the\r\n  agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The\r\n  facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent\r\n  entered into a contract with his friend and business associate, Complainant.Â \r\n  In the contract, respondent agreed to purchase a residential lot from\r\n  Complainant and Complainant agreed to finance the purchase.Â  There was no\r\n  written contract memorializing the terms of the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  \r\nRespondent prepared all of\r\n  the documents to complete the conveyance of the property, including the deed,\r\n  the mortgage, and the note.Â  In preparing these documents, respondent was\r\n  acting in a representative capacity for Complainant.Â  Â \r\nComplainant knew\r\n  respondent was an attorney with experience in residential real estate\r\n  transactions.Â  As a result, she did not consult with or obtain her own counsel\r\n  for the sale of her property to respondent.Â  Â Â  \r\nRespondent failed to\r\n  disclose to Complainant that it was a conflict of interest for him to engage in\r\n  a transaction with a client.Â  He did not obtain Complainantâ€™s written waiver of\r\n  or consent to the conflict and he did not advise Complainant to seek the advice\r\n  of independent counsel prior to entering into the transaction.Â  \r\nRespondent conducted a\r\n  closing in which he delivered two checks to Complainant as the agreed-upon down\r\n  payment.Â  At the closing, respondent instructed Complainant to sign two sets of\r\n  documents, one naming himself as grantee and one naming his LLC as grantee.Â  \r\nRespondent did not file\r\n  the deed or the mortgage after the closing.Â  He did not deliver the note to\r\n  Complainant.Â  \r\nWhen Complainant attempted\r\n  to negotiate the down payment checks, they were returned for insufficient\r\n  funds.Â  At respondentâ€™s request, Complainant attempted to negotiate the checks\r\n  a second time.Â  Again, the checks were returned for insufficient funds.Â  \r\nTwo months after the\r\n  closing, respondent applied for a loan to purchase another residential\r\n  property.Â  He attempted to use the lot he purchased from Complainant as\r\n  collateral.Â  The loan officer informed respondent that the deed conveying the\r\n  lot to him was not recorded.Â  At that time, respondent recorded the deed, but\r\n  not the mortgage.Â  \r\nRespondent paid\r\n  Complainant only five of the twelve scheduled payments in the year following\r\n  the closing.Â  He did not pay the balance in full which was due at the end of\r\n  the year.Â  \r\nSix months after the\r\n  balance in full was due, respondent brought his payments current, but did not\r\n  pay off the balance.Â  Ultimately, Complainant hired a lawyer.Â  Respondent then\r\n  sold the lot and paid her in full from the proceeds.Â  \r\nRespondent agrees the\r\n  terms of the transaction with Complainant were not fair and reasonable to\r\n  Complainant because respondentâ€™s personal financial situation rendered him\r\n  unable to pay as agreed.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nOn\r\n  December 21, 2007, respondent signed a plea agreement in which he pled to an\r\n  information charging him with one count of wire fraud.[1] Â The plea agreement was accepted by\r\n  the United States District Court on January 22, 2008.Â  The wire fraud to which\r\n  respondent pled guilty involved unauthorized transfers of client funds from\r\n  respondentâ€™s trust accounts for respondentâ€™s personal benefit from 2003 to\r\n  2007.Â  The total amount of funds respondent fraudulently obtained from his\r\n  trust accounts was $2,325,404.18. \r\nThe\r\n  unauthorized transfers from respondentâ€™s trust accounts resulted in a series of\r\n  checks being presented on insufficient funds which were reported to the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct by respondentâ€™s bank as required by Rule 1.15(h),\r\n  RLDE.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his\r\n  misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer \r\nshall act with reasonable diligence and promptness\r\n    in representing a client); Rule 1.7 (lawyer shall not represent client if\r\n    representation involves a conflict of interest unless specified conditions are\r\n    met); Rule 1.8 (lawyer shall not knowingly acquire possessory interest adverse\r\n    to client unless specified conditions are met); Â Rule 1.15\r\n  (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection\r\n  with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 8.4(b) (it\r\n  is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects\r\n  adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in\r\n  other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to\r\n  engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\r\n  deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct\r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice).Â  \r\nRespondent further admits his\r\n  misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline\r\n  for lawyer to be convicted of crime or moral turpitude or serious crime), Rule\r\n  7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct\r\n  tending to pollute administration of justice, bring courts or legal profession\r\n  into disrepute, or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule\r\n  7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate oath of\r\n  office).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent from the practice of law.Â  Further, before he\r\n  may file a Petition for Reinstatement, respondent must make restitution to all\r\n  clients, banks, the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection, and any other entities\r\n  which have been harmed as a result of his misconduct in connection with this\r\n  matter.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall\r\n  file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with\r\n  Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of\r\n  Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  Â  Â \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On August 7, 2007. the Court placed respondent\r\n  on interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Jordan, 374 S.C. 350, 650\r\n  S.E.2d 58 (2007).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26615","title":"Hiott v.

State, 375 S.C. 354, 652 S.E.2d 436 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We granted Hiottâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari and now reverse.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nHiott was convicted\r\n  of incest with his daughter after a two-day criminal trial on January 16 and\r\n  17, 2003.Â  He filed a PCR application on June 9, 2003.Â  Hiott was represented\r\n  by counsel at the PCR hearing.Â Â Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the hearing, Hiott asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective for, among\r\n  other things, failing to discover that his daughter had previously been\r\n  molested by a family friend.Â  He also contended the prosecution committed a Brady[1] violation by not disclosing this information to the defense.Â Â Â  \r\nHiottâ€™s\r\n  trial counsel apparently first became aware of the incident when one of Hiottâ€™s\r\n  family members advised him about it during Hiottâ€™s criminal trial.Â  Hiott\r\n  maintained the incident did not occur to him because he had put it out of his\r\n  mind, but if counsel had adequately questioned him it likely would have â€œjogged\r\n  [his] memoryâ€ and he probably would not have been convicted.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge found Hiottâ€™s claims in this regard were â€œabsurdâ€ and â€œpatently\r\n  frivolousâ€ because Hiott was the complaining party in the molestation case, yet\r\n  he supposedly forgot to mention it to his trial attorney.Â  The PCR judge further\r\n  found the prosecution did not commit a Brady violation as the\r\n  information was readily available to Hiott.Â  The PCR judge ruled the remaining\r\n  issues raised by Hiott were also without merit.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge imposed a $3,000 sanction on Hiott under Rule 11, SCRCP, finding\r\n  Hiottâ€™s testimony and claims were frivolous.Â  The PCR judge stated that he\r\n  considered many variables in making this decision, including the time and\r\n  expense incurred by the South Carolina Attorney Generalâ€™s Office, the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Corrections, Hiottâ€™s appointed attorney, and the court.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed the imposition of a sanction under Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  Hiott\r\n    v. State, 375 S.C. 354, 652 S.E.2d 436 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We granted Hiottâ€™s\r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari. \r\nII.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  decision of the PCR judge may be reversed when it is controlled by an error of\r\n  law.Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 526 S.E.2d 222 (2000).Â  This Court\r\n  is entitled to decide a novel question of law without any particular deference\r\n  to the lower court.Â  Page v. State, 364 S.C. 632, 615 S.E.2d 740 (2005).\r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRule\r\n  11(a), SCRCP provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n  The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a\r\n    certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion or other paper; that to\r\n    the best of his knowledge, information and belief there is good ground to\r\n    support it; and that it is not interposed for delay. \r\n  . . . .\r\n  . . .Â  If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed\r\n    in violation of this Rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative,\r\n    may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an\r\n    appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or\r\n    parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of\r\n    the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee.\r\n\r\nThe sole\r\n  issue before the Court of Appeals, as here, is whether the PCR judge erred in\r\n  finding Rule 11 applies to PCR proceedings.[2]Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals, noting this was a case of first impression, affirmed the\r\n  PCR judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  The court first noted that the Uniform Post-Conviction\r\n  Procedure Act specifically provides that the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure are applicable in PCR actions.Â  Hiott, 375 S.C. at 357, 652\r\n  S.E.2d at 437.\r\nSection\r\n  17-27-80 of the Act provides:Â  â€œAll rules and statutes applicable in civil\r\n  proceedings are available to the parties.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-80 (2003).Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals stated all rules that apply in civil cases apply to PCR\r\n  actions; therefore, â€œRule 11 would apply to PCR proceedings because PCR actions\r\n  are civil.â€Â  Hiott, 375 S.C. at 357, 652 S.E.2d at 437.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals next observed that the South Carolina Legislature has\r\n  specifically limited the application of discovery in PCR proceedings in section\r\n  17-27-150[3] of the Act, and stated that â€œ[i]f the legislature sought to limit the\r\n  applicability of Rule 11 to PCR proceedings as it sought to limit the discovery\r\n  process, the legislature would have inserted constricting language to that\r\n  effect in the Act.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  citing Rule 1 and Rule 71.1(a), SCRCP, the Court of Appeals observed that â€œthe\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure support the conclusion that Rule 11 is\r\n  applicable to PCR actions.â€Â  Id. at 357-58, 652 S.E.2d at 437.Â Â Â  \r\nRule\r\n  1, SCRCP states:Â  â€œThese rules govern the procedure in all South Carolina\r\n  courts in all suits of a civil nature whether cognizable as cases at law\r\n  or in equity, with the exceptions stated in Rule 81.â€Â  Rule 81 contains\r\n  no exception stating Rule 11 is inapplicable in PCR actions. \r\nRule\r\n  71.1(a), SCRCP, regarding PCR actions, provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a) Procedure.Â \r\n    The procedure for post-conviction relief is provided by the Uniform\r\n    Post-Conviction Procedure Act (Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 to -120 (1985).[4]Â \r\n    The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to the extent that they\r\n    are not inconsistent with the Act.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals concluded:Â  â€œGiven the plain language of Rules 1 and 71.1 and\r\n  that Rule 11 is consistent with the Act, ample justification exists to conclude\r\n  Rule 11 applies to PCR situations.â€Â  Hiott, 375 S.C. at 358, 652 S.E.2d\r\n  at 438.\r\nOn\r\n  review, Hiott asserts that Rule 11 sanctions should not apply in PCR proceedings\r\n  because â€œ[t]o hold otherwise would be to put a chilling effect on an\r\n  applicantâ€™s right to file for post-conviction relief.â€Â  Hiott states PCR\r\n  applications are often prepared by the petitioners themselves or other inmates,\r\n  and they are often not educated in the law and are not readily able to discern\r\n  meritorious issues.[5]Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State, in contrast, contends a circuit court judge has the authority to\r\n  sanction a PCR applicant just like any other plaintiff in a civil action and\r\n  that PCR applicants â€œdo not have special rights to present frivolous claims and\r\n  testimony.â€Â  The State argues â€œan applicantâ€™s education, representation by\r\n  counsel, potential reliance on an individual [who] is unlicensed to practice\r\n  law, and the manner in which a claim is raised are all considerations that a\r\n  circuit court could properly examine to determine if sanctions are\r\n  appropriate.â€Â  Moreover, any â€œ[s]anctions imposed . . . can be reviewed on appeal.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals correctly determined there is currently no provision in either\r\n  the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act or the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure that expressly prohibits the application of Rule 11 in PCR\r\n  actions.Â  \r\nIn an analogous\r\n  case, however, this Court previously held that a statute revoking inmate\r\n  credits for prisoners submitting frivolous claims or giving false testimony\r\n  should not be applied to PCR applicants.Â  In Wade v. State, 348 S.C.\r\n  255, 559 S.E.2d 843 (2002), the petitioner filed a PCR application, which was\r\n  denied.Â  The PCR judge also revoked petitionerâ€™s inmate credits under section\r\n  24-27-200 of the Inmate Litigation Act (ILA) for testifying falsely at the PCR\r\n  hearing.[6]Â  Id. at 257, 559 S.E.2d at 844.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  stated this provision â€œmay not stop a prisoner from utilizing the PCR\r\n  structure, but it would assuredly chill a prisonerâ€™s exercise of a\r\n  constitutional right,â€ and â€œ[s]uch a result is contrary to the long tradition\r\n  of giving prisoners ready access to PCR [proceedings].â€Â  Id. at 262, 559\r\n  S.E.2d at 846.\r\nFurther,\r\n  we reasoned that, although the ILA applies to civil actions, and PCR actions\r\n  are civil, courts treat PCR actions differently than traditional civil cases:\r\n\r\n  Courts treat PCR differently than traditional civil\r\n    cases.Â  For example, PCR actions are the only type of case which this Court\r\n    mandates appellate counsel must brief all arguable issues, despite counselâ€™s\r\n    belief the appeal is frivolous.Â  A lawyer knowingly filing a frivolous claim\r\n      in any other civil case violates Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  Additionally, a PCR\r\n    applicant who is granted a hearing has a statutory right to be represented by a\r\n    court-appointed attorney.Â  This right does not generally exist for plaintiffs\r\n    in civil cases.\r\n\r\nId. at 263, 559 S.E.2d at 847 (internal citations and\r\n  footnote omitted) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn Hiott,\r\n  the Court of Appeals, citing Wade, stated that it was â€œcognizant that\r\n  â€˜[c]ourts treat PCR differently than traditional civil cases,â€™â€ but\r\n  nevertheless concluded PCR courts have the authority to issue Rule 11 sanctions\r\n  against PCR applicants â€œgiven the plain language of the [Uniform\r\n  Post-Conviction Procedure] Act and the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure[.]â€Â  Hiott, 375 S.C. at 358, 652 S.E.2d at 438.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the PCR judge in the current case was understandably concerned with the\r\n  potential abuse of PCR proceedings by inmates filing meritless claims, as noted\r\n  in Wade, â€œthe legislative and judicial systems already place limitations\r\n  to deter inmate litigation abuse in the PCR process.â€Â  Wade, 348 S.C. at\r\n  263, 559 S.E.2d at 847.Â  \r\nâ€œFirst,\r\n  a petitioner must raise all available grounds for relief in the first PCR\r\n  application since successive actions are usually barred.â€Â  Id. at\r\n  263-64, 559 S.E.2d at 847; see also Aice v. State, 305 S.C. 448,\r\n  409 S.E.2d 392 (1991) (discussing successive applications); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-27-90 (2003) (stating all grounds for relief must be raised in the first PCR\r\n  application unless the court finds there is a sufficient reason why they were\r\n  not asserted in the original application).Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œSecond,\r\n  an applicant must file the PCR application within one year of the final\r\n  resolution of the criminal conviction.â€Â  Wade, 348 S.C. at 264, 559\r\n  S.E.2d at 847; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003) (stating a\r\n  PCR application â€œmust be filed within one year after the entry of a judgment of\r\n  conviction or within one year after the sending of the remittitur to the lower\r\n  court from an appeal or the filing of the final decision upon an appeal,\r\n  whichever is laterâ€).\r\nâ€œThird,\r\n  a petitioner faces a one-year deadline to file an application asserting a newly\r\n  created standard or right, and to raise newly discovered material facts.â€Â  Wade,\r\n  348 S.C. at 264, 559 S.E.2d at 847; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(B),\r\n  (C) (2003) (providing one year from the determination of a newly created\r\n  standard or right in subsection (B) and one year from the time new evidence was\r\n  discovered, or could have been discovered by due diligence, in subsection (C)).\r\nTogether,\r\n  these provisions effectively grant an individual â€œone chance to argue for\r\n  reliefâ€ within a year of the final appeal; consequently, â€œ[t]hese limitations\r\n  adequately prevent inmates from abusing the PCR process.â€Â  Wade, 348\r\n  S.C. at 264, 559 S.E.2d at 847.Â Â  \r\nGiven the public policy\r\n  considerations involved, including our recognition in Wade that PCR\r\n  actions are treated differently than traditional civil cases and that sanctions\r\n  of any kind could chill a petitionerâ€™s pursuit of PCR, as well as the fact that\r\n  there are already limitations in place that serve to curb the potential abuse\r\n  of the PCR process, we hold that Rule 11 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure does not apply in PCR proceedings.Â  We can discern no practical\r\n  benefit to be obtained by imposing sanctions on PCR petitioners who are often indigent.Â \r\n  Further, the increase in appellate review that would be necessitated by the challenges\r\n  to any sanctions imposed would create an additional burden on the resources of\r\n  the courts, which would effectively thwart the stated purpose of imposing\r\n  sanctions in the first place.\r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we hold, as a matter of public policy, that Rule 11 of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply to PCR proceedings.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Timothy M. Cain, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n[2]Â  The Court of Appeals noted that â€œHiott does not\r\n  argue the PCR judge abused his discretion by imposing sanctions.Â  The sole\r\n  issue on appeal is whether the PCR judge had authority to issue Rule 11\r\n  sanctions.Â  Thus, we do not address whether the PCR judge abused his discretion\r\n  in sanctioning Hiott.â€Â  Hiott, 375 S.C. at 358 n.5, 652 S.E.2d at 438\r\n  n.5.\r\n[3]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-150(A) (2003) (â€œA\r\n  party in a noncapital post-conviction relief proceeding shall be entitled to\r\n  invoke the processes of discovery available under the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure if, and to the extent that, the judge in the exercise of his\r\n  discretion and for good cause shown grants leave to do so, but not\r\n  otherwise.â€).\r\n[4]Â \r\nThe Act has been updated to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 to -120 (2003).\r\n[5] Hiott also maintains the Court of Appeals\r\n  â€œapparentlyâ€ found it was frivolous that he did not present testimony for some\r\n  of the claims he raised in his PCR application and penalized him.Â  He asserts\r\n  that requiring a petitioner to present meritless claims, however, would create\r\n  an undue burden on the courts.Â  As the State correctly points out, the Court of\r\n  Appeals made no such finding and did not examine the validity of Hiottâ€™s PCR\r\n  claims.Â  Thus, there is no merit to this allegation.\r\n[6]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-27-200 (2007) (providing for the forfeiture of\r\n  inmate credits by a prisoner who submits a frivolous claim, testifies falsely,\r\nunreasonably delays a proceeding, or abuses the discovery process).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26616","title":"Tennant v.

Thompson, all of Trask and Howell, of\r\n          Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the single\r\n  commissioner denied benefits, and the full commission, the circuit court, and\r\n  the court of appeals affirmed.Â  Tennant v. Beaufort County Sch. Dist. Op. No. 2007-UP-056 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 8, 2007).Â  This Court granted\r\n  a writ of certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner Marsha\r\n  Tennant worked as a special education teacher for thirty years prior to working\r\n  for Respondent in that same role.Â  In the fall of 2001, after being employed\r\n  for approximately one year with Respondent, two new aides were assigned to\r\n  assist Petitioner with her students in the classroom.Â  As the year progressed,\r\n  Petitioner was concerned that the aides were not performing their job in violation\r\n  of federal Individualized Education Programs regulations and worried that the\r\n  aidesâ€™ performances would jeopardize the education program.Â  Both Petitioner\r\n  and the aides complained to the supervisor.\r\nOn\r\n  October 18, 2001, after an argument with the aides, Tennant felt faint and went\r\n  to the nurseâ€™s office, where the nurse recorded Petitionerâ€™s blood pressure as\r\n  elevated.Â  Petitioner later returned to the nurseâ€™s office complaining of chest\r\n  pains and dizziness.Â  The nurse recorded a higher blood pressure and called an\r\n  ambulance.Â  The emergency room doctor diagnosed Petitioner with a stress\r\n  reaction.Â  \r\nAt the hearing,\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s family doctor (â€œFamily Doctorâ€) testified that Petitioner suffered a panic attack that was caused by work\r\n  conditions and diagnosed Petitioner with â€œsituational depression and panic\r\n  disorder.â€Â  Additionally, Petitioner submitted the deposition testimony of a\r\n  licensed social worker (â€œSociologistâ€) who began treating Petitioner at her\r\n  psychotherapy practice after the anxiety attack. Â Sociologist diagnosed\r\n  Petitioner with post traumatic stress disorder and continued panic attacks and\r\n  concluded that Petitioner should not return to work as a special education\r\n  teacher. Â Respondent submitted a letter from a psychiatrist (â€œPsychiatristâ€) who\r\n  evaluated Petitioner.Â  She concluded that Petitioner suffered a single anxiety\r\n  attack, but that Petitioner did not require additional medical treatment and\r\n  could return to work.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  single commissioner found that Petitioner failed to prove that the conditions\r\n  of her employment were either extraordinary or unusual.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  single commissioner gave greater weight to the testimony of Psychiatrist than\r\n  to the testimonies of Family Doctor and Sociologist and ruled that Sociologist\r\n  was not qualified to render an opinion on causation under South Carolina case\r\n  law.Â  The full commission ruled that Sociologistâ€™s testimony should be made a\r\n  part of the record, but affirmed the denial of benefits.Â  The circuit court and\r\n  the court of appeals found that substantial evidence in the record supported a\r\n  finding that Petitioner did not suffer a compensable injury, and therefore,\r\n  affirmed the full commissionâ€™s decision.\r\nWe granted\r\n  a writ of certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision, and Petitioner\r\n  presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    court of appeals err in affirming the order denying benefits because the full\r\n    commissionâ€™s decision is not support by substantial evidence?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\nREVIEW\r\nThis Court must affirm the findings of fact made by the full commission\r\n  if they are supported by substantial evidence. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276\r\n  S.C. 130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981). Â Substantial evidence is not a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole,\r\n  would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached. Tiller\r\n    v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d\r\n  843, 845 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues that the court of appeals erred in affirming the\r\n  full commissionâ€™s finding that she did not suffer a compensable injury.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  order to recover for mental injuries caused solely by emotional stress, or\r\n  â€œmental-mentalâ€ injuries, the claimant must\r\n  show that she was exposed to unusual and extraordinary conditions in her employment\r\n  and that these unusual and extraordinary conditions were the proximate cause of\r\n  the mental disorder.Â  Powell\r\n    v. Vulcan Materials Co., 299\r\n  S.C. 325, 384 S.E.2d 725 (1989).Â  This standard, also known\r\n  as the â€œheart attack standard,â€ balances the employeeâ€™s interests with the\r\n  employerâ€™s interests and provides a framework which ensures that the claimant\r\n  shows that she suffered a work-related injury.Â  Requiring a claimant to prove\r\n  exposure to â€œunusual or extraordinaryâ€ circumstances in a mental-mental injury\r\n  claim is consistent with the heightened burden required to prove a claim for\r\n  intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, a cause of action that\r\n  also allows recovery for mental injuries in the absence of physical injury.Â  See\r\n    Hasson v. Scalise Builders of South Carolina, 374\r\n  S.C. 352, 356, 650 S.E.2d 68, 71 (2007),\r\n  quoting Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 166, 276 S.E.2d\r\n  776, 780 (1981) (recognizing that â€œwhere\r\n  physical harm is lacking, the courts should look initially for more in the way\r\n  of extreme outrage as an assurance that the mental disturbance claimed is not\r\n  fictitiousâ€).\r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, Petitioner alleges that the aidesâ€™ insubordination created the unusual\r\n  and extraordinary conditions, which caused her panic attack.Â  Petitioner testified that the aides would walk out of the\r\n  classroom and refused to escort the children to the bathroom and that several\r\n  of her students regressed in their progress as a result of the aidesâ€™ actions.Â \r\n  She also testified that she reported her concerns to her supervisor, but the\r\n  supervisor sided with the aides and would not help her.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find substantial evidence in the record supports the full commissionâ€™s findings.Â \r\n  Although the conflict may have been stressful, it was not an unusual or\r\n  extraordinary circumstance of Petitionerâ€™s employment.Â  Neither the aides nor Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  supervisor threatened her, and the conflict never involved physical contact.Â  Petitioner\r\n  admits that a special education teacher is an inherently stressful job, and Social\r\n  Worker conceded that a panic attack may be triggered absent unusual or\r\n  extraordinary circumstances.Â  Additionally, Petitionerâ€™s supervisor testified\r\n  that conflicts\r\n  like the one between Petitioner and the aides were not unusual.Â  In\r\n  our view, cases\r\n  in which the Court has found unusual and extraordinary circumstances that\r\n  resulted in a mental injury involve much more extreme and severe facts.Â  See Shealy v. Aiken County, 341\r\n  S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000)\r\n  (finding the combination of death threats, gun incidents with\r\n  violent drug dealers, high tension confrontations, fear of being uncovered, and\r\n  loss of security as a police officer constituted unusual or extraordinary\r\n  conditions of employment when they occur over several months); Stokes v. First Nat. Bank, 306\r\n  S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1991)\r\n  (concluding that the extreme prolonged increase in employeeâ€™s\r\n  work hours, combined with additional job responsibilities, constituted unusual\r\n  and extraordinary conditions of employment); Powell, 299 S.C. at 328,\r\n  384 S.E.2d at 727 (holding that an intense verbal exchange between the employee\r\n  and the supervisor constituted unusual and extraordinary condition of\r\n  employeeâ€™s work). Â \r\nAccordingly, we hold that substantial evidence in the record\r\n  exists to support the commissionâ€™s decision that Petitioner failed to meet her burden that she suffered a\r\n  compensable injury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™\r\n  decision upholding the denial of benefits.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26617","title":"In the Matter of James W.

\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.\r\n          Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary\r\n          Counsel. \r\n        James W.\r\n          Fayssoux, of Greenville, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the\r\n  imposition of an admonition, a public reprimand, or the imposition of a definite\r\n  suspension not to exceed sixty (60) days.Â  We accept the Agreement and impose a\r\n  public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  self-reported to ODC that he, along with several other lawyers, numerous\r\n  non-lawyers, and several business entities had been named as defendants in\r\n  civil litigation initiated by a lender.Â  Respondentâ€™s errors and omissions\r\n  carrier settled the litigation by paying damages in an agreed amount of $35,000\r\nto the lender.Â  \r\nIt is\r\n  now known that, as a result of a federal investigation, James Byrd, Eric Byrd,\r\n  and their related business associates and/or entities entered into schemes to\r\n  acquire and then sell real estate at inflated values to the detriment of the\r\n  purchasers and to a lender who made loans to those purchasers.Â  Due to those\r\n  schemes, the lender made loans to persons it would not have otherwise approved.Â \r\n  Further, the lender made loans contrary to its policies and procedures and in\r\n  amounts in excess of its lending policies and procedures which it had in place\r\n  to promote timely repayment and to prevent default upon its loans secured by\r\n  real estate mortgages.Â  Subsequently, both the Byrds and others were indicted\r\nand sentenced to terms in federal prison for wire, mail, and/or bank fraud.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  represents that he was unaware of any criminal activity in connection with any\r\n  of the real estate transactions he handled that were arranged by the Byrds.Â \r\n  ODC does not dispute this representation.Â  Further, respondent represents that\r\n  he does not believe that his activities constituted criminal acts and ODC does\r\nnot dispute this representation.[1]Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  twenty-eight (28) real estate closings which were handled by respondent as\r\n  arranged by one or both of the Byrds revealed irregularities that ODC contends\r\n  constitute lawyer misconduct on the part of respondent.Â  With the advantage of\r\n  information revealed by hindsight and the investigation by the federal\r\nauthorities and ODC, respondent agrees with ODCâ€™s contention.Â  \r\nIn one\r\n  transaction, respondent wrote a check on his trust account payable to Vision\r\n  Enterprises, an entity known by respondent to be owned and/or controlled by one\r\n  or more of the Byrds.Â  The check was for the exact amount due to the seller\r\n  Eric Byrd on a related HUD-1 Settlement Statement prepared by respondent.Â  As a\r\n  result, the information furnished to the borrower and lender on the HUD-1\r\ncontained incorrect information.Â  \r\n In\r\n  another transaction, Vision Enterprises placed an $18,000 mechanics lien\r\n  against real property acquired by James Byrd who then sold the same property\r\n  the next day, paying the mechanics lien out of the proceeds of that sale.Â \r\n  Respondent prepared the closing papers and made the disbursements.Â  It is now\r\n  recognized that Byrd, through his colleagueâ€™s placement of the mechanics lien,\r\n  actually placed the mechanics lien against himself and then paid it out of the\r\n  proceeds of the sale to a borrower and a loan made by the lender, even though\r\n  little or no repairs were made to the property.Â  ODC contends respondent should\r\n  have recognized this was a sham mechanics lien because it was placed on\r\n  property by an entity or person known to respondent to be a Byrd confidant the\r\nvery day before Byrd and/or a Byrd-controlled entity sold the property.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  several other Byrd-arranged closings, the HUD-1s prepared by or at the\r\n  direction of respondent showed money being withheld for repairs.Â  It is now\r\n  known that little, if any, such repairs warranting the amount withheld were\r\n  actually made.Â  Respondent withheld the funds and paid them over to one or more\r\n  of the Byrds and/or one or more entities controlled by or having a very close\r\n  working relationship with the Byrds.Â  In retrospect, respondent now recognizes\r\n  that, as a result, both borrowers and lenders were acquiring interest in real\r\n  property at inflated values and/or there was greater consideration begin\r\n  received by the seller than reflected on the corresponding HUD-1s prepared by\r\nrespondent.Â  \r\nIn three\r\n  other transactions, respondentâ€™s firmâ€™s pension and profit sharing plan\r\n  provided loans in Byrd-arranged transactions (and then sold those properties\r\n  for a profit).Â  By participating in the transactions, respondent had business\r\n  dealings with a client without complying with the requirements of the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct. \r\nFurther,\r\n  the properties were sold to Byrd under financing to the pension and profit\r\n  sharing plan (secured by notes and mortgages to that plan from Byrd or Byrd-controlled\r\n  entities).Â  Respondent prepared the closing documents in these transactions and\r\n  then handled the closings when Byrd sold these three properties to borrowers.Â \r\n  Monies from these transactions were applied toward the notes and mortgages, but\r\n  no mention of the monies being paid to the pension and profit sharing plan of\r\n  respondentâ€™s firm were made on the borrowersâ€™ HUD-1s.Â  By omitting the\r\n  information from the HUD-1s, the information given to the lender and borrowers\r\n  was not entirely correct.Â  Further, respondent issued title insurance policies\r\n  that did not make exception to the mortgages, notwithstanding the fact that the\r\n  mortgages were publicly recorded.Â  These three transactions were the subject of\r\n  the civil litigation against respondent and the federal indictments against the\r\nByrds and others.Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  another transaction, Eric Byrd was the seller and another Byrd business\r\n  associate was the buyer in the arrangement.Â  Â Â Respondent was aware of the\r\n  relationship between the seller and buyer and closed the transaction.Â  Line 201\r\n  on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement (earnest money paid by borrowers) states that\r\n  $12,000 was paid as earnest money by the borrower when, in fact, no such amount\r\n  was received by respondent into his firmâ€™s trust account and no notation â€œPOCâ€\r\n  (paid outside of closing) was made on that line.Â  As a result, the receipts and\r\n  disbursements made out of respondentâ€™s trust account were not consistent with\r\nthe information on the HUD-1.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  several other matters closed by respondent, James Byrd purchased transactions\r\n  as refinancings which allowed Byrd to circumvent the lenderâ€™s guidelines, procedures,\r\n  and policies applicable to purchase transactions to avoid the lender making\r\n  loans on property at inflated amounts.Â  In furtherance of this scheme, a\r\n  Byrd-controlled land trust served as a straw buyer giving a note and mortgage.Â \r\n  Respondent was aware that the land trust was a Byrd-related and controlled\r\n  entity.Â  In hindsight, respondent acknowledges the peculiarities of these\r\n  transactions should have served as â€œred flagsâ€ that improprieties were being\r\ncommitted in connection with these real estate transactions.Â  \r\nAnother\r\n  Byrd scheme was to make fictitious notes and mortgages from Byrd cohorts as\r\n  â€œborrowersâ€ to Next Generation (an entity known at the time by respondent to be\r\n  Byrd-controlled). Â While respondent did not draft these notes and mortgages, in\r\n  some cases they were drawn and recorded the day before respondent conducted the\r\n  closings on the encumbered property sold to genuine borrowers.Â  Respondent\r\n  should have seen additional â€œred flagsâ€ when Byrd left the closing with a check\r\n  made to the lender, especially when a known Byrd family member was the\r\nborrower.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  represents that all checks exchanged during these transactions were honored\r\n  upon presentment.Â  ODC does not dispute this representation.Â  However, it is\r\n  now known that personal checks which were brought to closings handled by\r\n  respondent in some of the transactions by the Byrds or their associates would\r\n  only be made good out of the proceeds of the ultimate, inflated sales of the\r\nsubject property.Â  \r\nToward\r\n  the end of their relationship, respondent began having concerns about the\r\n  propriety of the Byrdsâ€™ transactions.Â  Around the same time, one of the Byrds\r\n  asked respondent to assist in â€œflipâ€ transactions; respondent recognized participating\r\n  in a â€œflipâ€ transaction would constitute misconduct.Â  Respondent ceased closing\r\ntransactions for the Byrds.\r\nRespondent\r\n  has been engaged in the practice of law since 1972.Â  He has no prior\r\n  disciplinary history.Â  He has fully cooperated with ODCâ€™s inquiries into this\r\nmatter.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that\r\n  his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers).Â  In addition, respondent admits he has violated the following\r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.7(a) (lawyer shall not represent\r\n  client if representation involves concurrent conflict of interest); Rule 1.8(a)\r\n  (lawyer shall not enter into business transaction with client or knowingly\r\n  acquire a pecuniary or security interest adverse to a client unless certain\r\n  conditions are met); Rule 4.1(a) (in course of representing client, lawyer\r\n  shall not make false statement of material fact to a third person); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer\r\n    to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\n    misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or\r\n    misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer\r\n    to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe misconduct reported in this opinion would\r\n  normally warrant the imposition of a suspension from the practice of law.Â \r\n  However, because respondent self-reported his misconduct to ODC, fully\r\n  cooperated with the disciplinary investigation, and has served the Bar of this\r\n  State for more than thirty years with no prior disciplinary history, we find\r\n  that a public reprimand is warranted.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\nand KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was not charged with any criminal\r\n  activity in connection with the transactions reported in this opinion and\r\nneither respondent nor ODC expect any charges to be filed in the future.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26618","title":"Berry v.

Carter, of South Carolina Commission on\r\n          Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Attorney\r\n          General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n          Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General S.\r\n          Prentiss Counts, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â Â Â Â Â  We granted a writ of certiorari\r\n  to review the denial of Donald\r\n  D. Berryâ€™s application for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  Berry pled guilty to\r\n  a drug charge, second offense, and was sentenced to prison.Â  The prior offense\r\n  for enhancement purposes was a drug paraphernalia conviction.Â  Because a drug\r\n  paraphernalia conviction does not qualify as a prior offense for enhancement\r\n  purposes under South Carolinaâ€™s statutory scheme and plea counsel neither informed\r\n  Berry of this fact nor made an objection in the plea court, we reverse the\r\n  denial of PCR, vacate the guilty plea, and remand to the general sessions\r\n  court.\r\nI.\r\nBerry pled guilty to manufacturing methamphetamine, second\r\n  offense, and was sentenced to seven yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  The plea was enhanced\r\n  to a second offense by Berryâ€™s prior conviction for possession of drug\r\n  paraphernalia.Â  As part of the plea agreement, an accompanying possession with\r\n  intent to distribute methamphetamine charge was dismissed.Â  The PCR court found\r\n  Berry did not establish his entitlement to relief and denied his application.Â \r\n  Berry sought a writ of certiorari, which we granted.\r\nSection\r\n  44-53-470 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) states, â€œ[a]n offense is\r\n  considered a second or subsequent offense if . . . the offender has been\r\n  convicted within the previous ten years of a violation of a provision of this\r\n  article or of another state or federal statute relating to narcotic drugs,\r\n  marijuana, depressants, stimulants, or hallucinogenic drugs . . . .â€Â \r\n  Additionally, section 44-53-375(B)(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2007) provides the following requirements for an enhanced offense:\r\n\r\n  [F]or a second offense or if, in the case of a first conviction of\r\n    a violation of this section, the offender has been convicted of any of the laws\r\n    of the United States or of any state, territory, or district relating to\r\n    narcotic drugs, marijuana, depressant, stimulant, or hallucinogenic drugs, the\r\n    offender must be imprisoned for not less than five years nor more than thirty\r\n    years, or fined not more than fifty thousand dollars, or both.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nWhether\r\n  a drug paraphernalia conviction qualifies as a prior offense for enhancement\r\n  purposes has not been decided by this Court.Â  The question is one of statutory\r\n  construction. Â See State\r\n    v. Dingle, 376 S.C. 643, 649, 659\r\n  S.E.2d 101, 105 (2008) (â€œIn interpreting statutes, the Court looks to the plain\r\n  meaning of the statute and the intent of the Legislature.â€). Â Moreover, in construing a criminal statute, we are guided by the\r\n  rule of lenityâ€”the principle that any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of\r\n  the accused. Â State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991) (â€œ[W]hen a statute is penal in nature, it must be\r\n  construed strictly against the State and in favor of the defendant.â€).Â  We hold that the Legislature intended a prior\r\n  offense to qualify for enhancement purposes only if the prior offense â€œrelates\r\n  toâ€ one of the statutorily enumerated drugs.\r\nTo\r\n  construe a paraphernalia conviction as â€œrelating toâ€ drugs would be contrary to\r\n  unambiguously expressed legislative intent and additionally violate the rule of\r\n  lenity long established in our jurisprudence.Â  Moreover, were we to construe\r\n  the phrase â€œrelate toâ€ so loosely as to include a paraphernalia conviction,\r\n  there would essentially be no limitation for qualifying enhancement offenses.Â \r\n  We therefore hold that a conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia may not be used for enhancement purposes as it does\r\n  not â€œrelate toâ€ drugs as statutorily mandated.\r\nIII.\r\nIneffective Assistance of Counsel\r\nWe now\r\n  turn to Berryâ€™s PCR claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  To establish a\r\n  claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, a PCR\r\n  applicant must prove deficient representation and resulting prejudice. Â Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).\r\nWhere\r\n  a defendant pleads guilty upon the advice of counsel, post-conviction relief is\r\n  available only when the applicant proves the advice he received from counsel\r\n  â€œfell below an objective standard of reasonablenessâ€ and that â€œbut forâ€ counselâ€™s\r\n  deficient representation, he would not have pled guilty.Â  Hill v. Lockhart,\r\n  474 U.S. 52, 56-59 (1985). Â Plea counsel for Berry acknowledges he neither\r\n  challenged the Stateâ€™s reliance on the paraphernalia conviction for enhancement\r\n  purposes, nor informed Berry of the potential challenge.\r\nA. Deficient Representation\r\nWe\r\n  find plea counselâ€™s failure to inform Berry of the potential challenge of the\r\n  use of the paraphernalia conviction for enhancement purposes amounts to deficient\r\n  representation.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 687.Â  In so ruling, we recognize that a defendant, for a host of legitimate reasons, may\r\n  plead guilty to an offense for which a valid legal challenge may exist.Â  See\r\n    Rollison v. State, 346 S.C. 506, 510, 552 S.E.2d 290, 292 (2001) (â€œA\r\n  defendant may, as part of a plea bargain, agree to plead guilty to a crime for\r\n  which he has been indicted (or to which he has waived grand jury presentment),\r\n  but of which he is not guilty.â€); Anderson v. State, 342 S.C. 54, 58,\r\n  535 S.E.2d 649, 651 (2000) (â€œWe find\r\n  the decision to accept a plea to voluntary manslaughter notwithstanding the\r\n  lack of any provocation was simply a tactical maneuver to avoid the very real\r\n  possibility that the jury might come back with a verdict of murder.Â  Accordingly, we find the plea was knowingly and voluntarily\r\n  entered.â€).Â  The difference in such circumstances between a valid guilty\r\n  plea and an invalid guilty plea lies in the knowing and voluntary nature of the\r\n  plea.Â  Here, counsel never informed Berry of the potential challenge to the use\r\n  of the drug paraphernalia conviction for enhancement.Â  In fact, Berryâ€™s plea counsel never gave any thought to the issue.\r\nWe\r\n  believe the Sixth Amendment guarantee of effective assistance of counsel requires\r\n  that counsel accurately inform a defendant, to the extent possible, of the\r\n  qualifying nature of a prior offense for enhancement purposes.Â  It may well be\r\n  that in situations unlike the one before us, the answer is unclear.Â  Yet, an\r\n  accused is entitled to counselâ€™s considered and reasonable judgment.[1]Â \r\n  In fact, uncertainty concerning a potential legal challenge may well provide a\r\n  defendant a catalyst in plea negotiations with the State.Â  In this regard, a\r\n  defendant may choose to forgo a legal challenge and opt for what he considers a\r\n  favorable plea arrangement, especially where other charges will be dismissed or\r\n  sentences are run concurrently.\r\nThis\r\n  â€œgive and takeâ€ lies at the heart of virtually every guilty plea, as plea\r\n  agreements allow our overly burdened criminal courts to function.Â  The point,\r\n  for purposes of the issue before us, is that such decisions must be made\r\n  knowingly and voluntarily with the advice of constitutionally competent\r\n  counsel.Â  Simply saying â€œI never gave it a thoughtâ€ falls short of the Sixth\r\n  Amendment guarantee of effective assistance of counsel.Â  As a result, we find\r\n  counselâ€™s failure to even consider whether a paraphernalia conviction qualifies\r\n  for enhancement, and so inform Berry, fell below the standard of objective\r\n  reasonableness.Â  We therefore find plea counsel provided constitutionally deficient\r\n  representation.\r\nB.\r\n  Prejudice\r\nWe\r\n  next turn to the second step in the analysisâ€”whether Berry was prejudiced by the\r\n  deficient representation.Â  Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 687.Â  As this was a guilty plea, Berry â€œmust show that there\r\n  is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, he would not have\r\n  pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.â€Â  Hill, 474 U.S. at 59.Â  During the PCR hearing, Berry repeatedly said that he would have gone to trial\r\n  had he known that his paraphernalia conviction did not qualify as a prior\r\n  offense for enhancement purposes.

Knight was an elderly resident of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, who died on\r\n  October 3, 2005, as a result of lung cancer.Â  Approximately one month prior to\r\n  her death, attorney M. Robin Morris was engaged by Knight to prepare her estate\r\n  plan.Â  Morris provided Knight with an estate planning questionnaire.Â  Knight returned the estate\r\n  planning questionnaire to Morris on Thursday, September 22, 2005.Â  Appellants Robert A. Rydde and Brandon Konija, and others, were included\r\n  as prospective will beneficiaries in the questionnaire completed by Knight.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  Tuesday, September 27, 2005, Morris delivered to Knight a portion of the\r\n  requested estate plan documents: a durable healthcare power of attorney and a\r\n  durable financial power of attorney.Â  These documents were not executed.Â \r\n  Knight was incapacitated on September 28, for she was on a respirator in the\r\n  intensive care unit and was in a drug-induced sleep.Â  As noted, Knight died on\r\n  October 3.\r\nBecause a will was not prepared for execution prior to Knightâ€™s\r\n  death, her estate passed through intestacy.Â  Appellants filed this legal malpractice action under various\r\n  theories, all of which are premised on the imposition of a duty on Morris in\r\n  favor of the non-client prospective beneficiaries. Â Morris answered the\r\n  complaint by moving to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.\r\nII.\r\nThe learned trial judge\r\n  determined that Appellantsâ€™ complaint failed to â€œstate facts sufficient to\r\n  constitute a cause of action.â€Â  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  On appeal from the\r\n  dismissal of a case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), an appellate court applies the\r\n  same standard of review as the trial court.Â  Williams v. Condon,\r\n  347 S.C. 227, 233, 553 S.E.2d 496, 500 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  That standard requires\r\n  the Court to construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the nonmovant\r\n  and determine if the â€œfacts alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible\r\n  from the pleadings would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the\r\n  case.â€Â  Id. at 233, 553 S.E.2d at 499.\r\nIII.\r\nAppellants\r\n  assert that attorney Morris owed them a duty to draft a will for Knight (naming\r\n  Appellants as beneficiaries) between Thursday September 22, 2005, and the\r\n  following Tuesday, September 27, which was the day before Knight became\r\n  completely unresponsive. Â Without pause, we reject the notion of imposing a\r\n  duty on an attorney in favor of a prospective beneficiary for the attorneyâ€™s purported\r\n  negligent failure to timely draft a will.\r\nA.\r\nWe begin with South Carolina law.Â  A plaintiff in a legal malpractice action must establish four\r\n  elements: (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; (2) a breach of\r\n  duty by the attorney; (3) damage to the client; and (4) proximate cause of the\r\n  clientâ€™s damages by the breach.Â  Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard,\r\n  322 S.C. 433, 435 n.2, 472 S.E.2d 612, 613 n.2 (1996); Ellis v. Davidson,\r\n  358 S.C. 509, 523, 595 S.E.2d 817, 824 (Ct. App. 2004); Hall v. Fedor,\r\n  349 S.C. 169, 174, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œBefore a claim for\r\n  malpractice may be asserted, there must exist an attorney-client\r\n  relationship.â€Â  Am. Fed. Bank, FSB v. No. One Main Joint Venture, 321\r\n  S.C. 169, 174, 467 S.E.2d 439, 442 (1996); see also Pye v. Estate of Fox,\r\n  369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006) (â€œ[A]n attorney is immune from\r\n  liability to third persons arising from the performance of his professional\r\n  activities as an attorney on behalf of and with the knowledge of his client.â€\r\n  (quoting Gaar v. N. Myrtle Beach Realty Co., Inc., 287 S.C. 525, 528,\r\n  339 S.E.2d 887, 889 (Ct. App. 1986))).Â  \r\nB.\r\nOur\r\n  decision today not to impose a duty on an attorney in favor of a prospective\r\n  beneficiary for alleged negligent failure to draft a will follows the law in\r\n  other jurisdictions.Â  We find persuasive the reasoning of decisions from New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Florida.Â  We reference these three jurisdictions, for these\r\n  states recognize generally that an attorney owes a duty to a non-client intended\r\n  beneficiary of an executed will where it is shown that the testatorâ€™s intent has\r\n  been defeated or diminished by negligence on the part of the attorney,\r\n  resulting in loss to the beneficiary.Â  Having relaxed the traditional privity requirement\r\n  in legal malpractice claims, these states nevertheless draw the line and refuse\r\n  for compelling policy reasons to permit a malpractice claim by a non-client for\r\n  negligent failure to draft a will. [1]\r\nÂ The\r\n  Connecticut Supreme Court was presented with this issue in Krawczyk v.\r\n    Stingle, 543 A.2d 733 (Conn. 1988).Â  While acknowledging its precedent permitting\r\n  a cause of action against an attorney who failed to draft a will in conformity\r\n  with a testatorâ€™s wishes, the Krawczyk court addressed â€œwhether such\r\n  liability should be further expanded to encompass negligent delay in completing\r\n  and furnishing estate planning documents for execution by the client.â€Â  Id. at 735.Â  The Connecticut Supreme Court concluded â€œthat the imposition of\r\n  liability to third parties for negligent delay in the execution of estate\r\n  planning documents would not comport with a lawyerâ€™s duty of undivided loyalty\r\n  to the client.â€Â  Id. at 736.Â  Krawczyk advanced the following\r\n  policy rationale for its decision, with which we concur:\r\n\r\n  A central dimension of the attorney-client relationship\r\n    is the attorneyâ€™s duty of â€œ[e]ntire devotion to the interest of the client.â€ Â This\r\n    obligation would be undermined were an attorney to be held liable to third\r\n    parties if, due to the attorneyâ€™s delay, the testator did not have an\r\n    opportunity to execute estate planning documents prior to death.Â  Imposition of\r\n    liability would create an incentive for an attorney to exert pressure on a\r\n    client to complete and execute estate planning documents summarily.Â  Fear of liability\r\n    to potential third party beneficiaries would contravene the attorneyâ€™s primary\r\n    responsibility to ensure that the proposed estate plan effectuates the clientâ€™s\r\n    wishes and that the client understands the available options and the legal and\r\n    practical implications of whatever course of action is ultimately\r\n    chosen.Â  These potential conflicts of interest are especially significant in\r\n    the context of the final disposition of a clientâ€™s estate, where the testatorâ€™s\r\n    testamentary capacity and the absence of undue influence are often central\r\n    issues.Â  \r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted).\r\nIn Sisson\r\n  v. Jankowski, 809 A.2d 1265 (N.H. 2002), the New Hampshire Supreme Court answered\r\n  a certified question from the United States District Court for the District of New\r\n  Hampshire: â€œ[w]hether . . . an attorneyâ€™s negligent failure to arrange for his\r\n  or her clientâ€™s timely execution of a will . . . which failure proximately\r\n  caused the client to die intestate, gives rise to a viable common law claim\r\n  against that attorney by an intended beneficiary of the unexecuted will.â€Â  Id. at 1265-66.Â  Sisson, relying on Krawczyk and other authorities,\r\n  answered the question in the negative.Â  By focusing on â€œthe importance of an\r\n  attorneyâ€™s undivided loyalty to a client,â€ the Sisson analysis mirrors\r\n  the self-evident policy considerations discussed in Krawczyk.Â Â  \r\n\r\n  [W]e\r\n    conclude that the risk of interfering with the attorneyâ€™s duty of undivided\r\n    loyalty to the client exceeds the risk of harm to the prospective beneficiary.Â \r\n    For these reasons, we join the majority of courts that have considered this\r\n    issue and hold that an attorney does not owe a duty of care to a prospective\r\n    will beneficiary to have the will executed promptly.\r\n\r\nId. at 1270.\r\nWe\r\n  next turn to a Florida Court of Appeals case, Babcock v. Malone, 760\r\n  So.2d 1056 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2000). Â Babcock and others filed a lawsuit\r\n  alleging that their uncleâ€™s lawyer was â€œnegligent in failing to timely prepare\r\n  a new will for [him].Â  As a result, their uncle died before executing the new\r\n  will under which [Babcock and the others] would have inherited, and instead\r\n  they were left nothing.â€Â  Id. at 1056.Â  The trial court dismissed the\r\n  lawsuit for failure to state a cause of action.Â  Babcock focused on the\r\n  absence of an executed will and rejected the legal malpractice claim, noting\r\n  the â€œrisk of misinterpreting the testatorâ€™s intentâ€ and the â€œheighten[ed] . . .\r\n  tendency to manufacture false evidence that cannot be rebutted due to the\r\n  unavailability of the testator.â€Â  Id. at 1057 (quoting Espinosa v.\r\n    Sparber, Shevin, Shapo, Rosen &amp; Heilbronner, 612 So.2d 1378, 1380 (Fla. 1993)). Â \r\nC.\r\nAnd\r\n  finally, this Courtâ€™s recent recognition of a physicianâ€™s limited duty to third\r\n  parties lends Appellants no support.Â  In Hardee v. Bio-Medical Applications\r\n    of S.C., Inc., 370 S.C. 511, 636 S.E.2d 629 (2006), a physician failed to\r\n  warn a patient of the ill effects that could result from dialysis treatment.Â \r\n  While driving home following the dialysis treatment, the patient lost control\r\n  of his vehicle and collided with a vehicle in which Allene and Kathleen Hardee\r\n  were traveling.Â  The Hardees filed a tort action against the physician for\r\n  failure to provide appropriate warnings to the patient.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  reversed the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the physician and noted\r\n  that â€œa medical provider has a duty to warn [the patient] of the dangers\r\n  associated with medical treatment.â€ Â Id. at 516, 636 S.E.2d at 631.Â \r\n  Based on the duty to warn the patient, we held that â€œa medical provider who\r\n  provides treatment which it knows may have detrimental effects on a patientâ€™s\r\n  capacities and abilities owes a duty to prevent harm to patients and to\r\n  reasonably foreseeable third parties by warning the patient of the attendant\r\n  risks and effects before administering the treatment.â€Â  Id. at 516, 636\r\n  S.E.2d at 631-32.Â  Appellants misapprehend the reach of Hardee.\r\nThe\r\n  central feature in Hardeeâ€™s â€œvery narrow holdingâ€ is the recognition\r\n  that â€œthis duty owed to third parties is identical to the duty owed to the\r\n  patient.â€ Id. at 516, 636 S.E.2d at 632. Â Thus, a medical providerâ€™s\r\n  breach of a potential duty to reasonably foreseeable third parties is\r\n  inextricably connected to a breach of duty to the patient.Â  We stressed that\r\n  â€œour holding does not hamper the doctor-patient relationship.â€Â  Id. at 516, 636 S.E.2d at 632.\r\nHardee lends Appellants no aid.Â  The imposition of a duty on\r\n  an attorney to a prospective beneficiary of a nonexistent will would wreak\r\n  havoc on the attorneyâ€™s ethical duty of undivided loyalty to the client and\r\n  force an impermissible wedge in the attorney-client relationship. Â The\r\n  rationale and policy underpinnings of Hardee support our rejection of\r\n  the duty Appellants seek to impose. \r\nIV.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, under the circumstances presented, we see no reason to depart from\r\n  existing law which imposes a privity requirement as a condition to maintaining\r\n  a legal malpractice claim in South Carolina.Â  We hold an attorney owes no duty\r\n  to a prospective beneficiary of a nonexistent will.Â  The judgment of the trial\r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] While Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Florida all recognize that a non-client may maintain a legal malpractice claim under\r\n  certain circumstances, these states follow different approaches.Â  These states,\r\n  however, are uniform in their rejection of a claim by a non-client for alleged\r\n  negligence for the failure to draft a will.Â  For an in depth analysis of the\r\n  different approaches in the Nation, see Max.

South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, 372 S.C.\r\n  119, 641 S.E.2d 45 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  In Brownlee, the South Carolina\r\n  Court of Appeals reversed a circuit court order affirming the denial of dock\r\n  permits to Samuel Brownlee and Richard Jolly (Landowners) by DHECâ€™s Office of\r\n  Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM).Â  We reverse, finding DHEC properly\r\n  denied the permit requests. \r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nLandowners\r\n  have property on Johns Island that is adjacent to an unnamed tributary of the Bohicket River in Charleston County, South Carolina.Â  Landowners brought this action against\r\n  DHEC after it denied their requests for construction permits to extend their\r\n  docks across the tributary to the Bohicket River.Â  Landowners asserted the\r\n  location of a dock owned by a neighbor, Lawrence Atkinson, was situated near\r\n  the mouth of the tributary in a manner that made the water no longer\r\n  navigable.Â Â Â  \r\nDHEC\r\n  denied the permits on the basis it would be contrary to existing regulations to\r\n  allow the docks to cross the tributary.Â  Specifically, after DHEC staff\r\n  conducted a boat trip in the area, DHEC determined the tributary was navigable\r\n  and that construction of the docks would violate the regulatory prohibition on\r\n  crossing navigable creeks.Â  DHEC advised the Landowners of its decision in\r\n  letters sent in April 2002:\r\n\r\n\tOCRM staff [DHEC] has determined that authorizing the\r\n  dock extension would be counter to Regulations.Â  OCRM Regulations specifically\r\n  state, â€œdocks shall not impede navigation and they can only extend to the first\r\n  navigable creek as evidenced by a significant change in grade.â€Â  OCRM staff\r\n  performed a boat trip and found that the creek exhibits significant width (50&#8242;)\r\n  and change in grade at your dock that exudes the very nature of a waterbody\r\n  that is navigable.Â  Furthermore, the creek has an established history of public\r\n  use as evidenced by the 4 docks that currently access this creek.Â  \r\n\r\nDHEC relied upon several provisions,\r\n  including former 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n) (Supp. 2001),[1] in support of the denial of Landownersâ€™ applications.Â  This regulation has\r\n  since been amended, but the former version relied upon by DHEC at the time the\r\n  permit applications were considered is controlling for purposes of this appeal.[2] \r\nUpon review, an\r\n  administrative law judge[3] (ALJ) ordered DHEC to issue the permits.Â  The ALJ noted that â€œ[a] creek is not\r\n  navigable unless the waterway has the capacity for â€˜valuable floatage,â€™â€ and\r\n  the test is not whether it is accessible at all times, but whether it is\r\n  accessible at the ordinary stage of the water.â€Â  He stated that â€œthe area of\r\n  the tributary in front of [Landownersâ€™] property is currently a defined\r\n  channel, as evidenced by a significant change in grade with the surrounding\r\n  marsh.â€Â  However, he â€œconclude[d] that in order for a waterway to be legally\r\n  navigable under Regulation 30-12A(2)(n), the navigation of the waterway must\r\n  not be so impeded as to create a frequent hazard.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  ALJ stated the waterway was not navigable and explained â€œthe determination that\r\n  the tributary is not navigable is due to a man-made impediment.Â  If the\r\n  Atkinson dock is removed from its location in the mouth of the tributary, theÂ \r\n  impediment would no longer exist and the tributary would be a navigable\r\n  stream.â€Â  The ALJ reversed DHECâ€™s decision and remanded the case for DHEC to\r\n  either have the Atkinson dock removed from its current location and built as\r\n  permitted[4] or to approve Landownersâ€™ applications.Â  \r\nUpon motion, the ALJ amended his order â€œto clarify [his] conclusionsâ€ as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThough\r\n  the waters of the tributary in front of the [Landownersâ€™] property are\r\n    navigable, the waterway itself is not navigable because the mouth of the\r\n      tributary cannot safely be entered at the ordinary stages of the tide.Â \r\n  This case presents exceptional facts because the safety of the navigation\r\n  varies depending upon the winds, tide, currents, etc.Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  \r\n\r\nIn this amended order, the\r\n  ALJ ordered DHEC to grant outright Landownersâ€™ permit applications to extend\r\n  their docks to the Bohicket River.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel (the Appellate Panel) reversed the ALJ\r\n  and reinstated the denial of the permits, finding the ALJ had erred in several\r\n  conclusions of law.Â  Specifically, the Appellate Panel found the ALJ â€œerred in\r\n  his interpretation of 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n), where he\r\n  concludes in Conclusion of Law Number 6, that â€˜in order for a waterway to be\r\n  legally navigable . . . , the navigation of the waterway must not be so impeded\r\n  as to create a frequent hazard.â€™â€Â  In addition, the panel found the ALJ\r\n  committed â€œreversible error in Conclusion of Law Number 4, specifically:Â  â€˜the\r\n  facts establish that the mouth of the tributary cannot be consistently\r\n  navigated safely at the ordinary stages of the tides because of the Atkinson\r\n  dock.Â  Therefore, I find that it currently is not a navigable waterway.â€™â€Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel.Â  The circuit court stated the\r\n  â€œcentral issueâ€ in this case â€œconcerns an interpretation of state law that\r\n  limits the circumstances under which docks may be constructed across navigable\r\n  waterways, specifically the interpretation of . . . Reg. 30-12 . . . .â€Â  The\r\n  circuit court concluded that the Appellate Panel acted â€œwithin the scope of\r\n  [its] authority by setting forth [its] own interpretation of the regulationsâ€\r\n  and â€œagree[d] with [its] interpretation that Reg. 30-12 prohibits the crossing\r\n  of navigable waterways unless there is an obstruction, which prohibits\r\n  navigation at most stages of the tide cycle.â€Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  further review, the South Carolina Court of Appeals reversed in a split\r\n  decision.Â  The majority found the ALJ had not committed an error of law and his\r\n  factual findings were supported by substantial evidence and should be upheld\r\n  under the applicable standard of review.Â  Brownlee, 372 S.C. at 126, 641\r\n  S.E.2d at 48.Â  In particular, the majority held the Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  determination that the ALJ had misinterpreted what constitutes a navigable\r\n  waterway under Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n) was in error.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  dissent, in contrast, agreed with the Appellate Panelâ€™s determination that the\r\n  ALJ erred in his interpretation of what legally constitutes a navigable\r\n  waterway.Â  The dissent noted that the ALJ had expressly found the tributary was\r\n  navigable, but the ALJ had, nevertheless, concluded that because navigation at\r\n  the mouth of the tributary was impeded by the Atkinson dock, the tributary was\r\n  rendered nonnavigable.Â  Id. at 133, 641 S.E.2d at 52 (Goolsby, J.,\r\n  dissenting).Â  The dissent contended that â€œ[t]he mere fact that an artificial\r\n  structure, such as Atkinsonâ€™s dock, impedes navigation, does not make the\r\n  waterway nonnavigableâ€ and that there was â€œno compelling reason to reverse the\r\n  agencyâ€™s interpretation of its own regulation.â€Â  Id. at 134, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  at 52.Â  This Court granted DHECâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari.\r\nII.Â  ISSUES\r\nOn\r\n  certiorari, DHEC contends the Court of Appeals erred in evaluating the legal\r\n  standard for navigability in this case as a question of fact rather than a\r\n  question of law.Â  DHEC also contends the Appellate Panelâ€™s interpretation of\r\n  its regulation should be awarded deference and upheld.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  350 S.C. 159, 565 S.E.2d 119 (Ct.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 363 S.C. 67, 75, 610 S.E.2d 482, 486 (2005); see also Brown\r\n      v.

Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  30-12(A)(2)(n) (Supp. 2001) (emphasis added).\r\nâ€œNavigable\r\n  water is a public highway which the public is entitled to use for the purposes\r\n  of travel either for business or pleasure.â€Â  State ex rel. Lyon v. Columbia\r\n    Water Power Co., 82 S.C. 181, 189, 63 S.E. 884, 888 (1909).\r\nNavigable\r\n  water is protected under state law to ensure public access.Â  S.C. Const. art.\r\n  XIV, Â§ 4 (declaring navigable waters to be public highways for which citizens\r\n  are entitled to free access); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 49-1-10 (Supp. 2008) (â€œAll\r\n  streams which have been rendered or can be rendered capable of being navigated\r\n  by rafts of lumber or timber by the removal of accidental obstructions and all\r\n  navigable watercourses and cuts are hereby declared navigable streams and such\r\n  streams shall be common highways and forever free . . . .â€).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  determining navigability, â€œ[t]he true test to be applied is whether a stream\r\n  inherently and by its nature has the capacity for valuable floatage,\r\n  irrespective of the fact of actual use or the extent of such use.â€Â  State ex\r\n    rel. Medlock v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 289 S.C. 445, 449, 346\r\n  S.E.2d 716, 719 (1986).Â  â€œValuable floatage is not necessarily commercial\r\n  floatage.â€Â  Id.Â  Commercial use of the waterway is not required for it\r\n  to be navigable; and pleasure traffic is entitled to protection in using the\r\n  waterway.Â  Hughes v. Nelson, 303 S.C. 102, 399 S.E.2d 24 (Ct. App.\r\n  1990). \r\nâ€œValuable\r\n  floatageâ€ is a term that has been used as the standard in this state for many\r\n  years.Â  See Heyward v. Farmersâ€™ Mining Co., 42 S.C. 138, 19 S.E.\r\n  963 (1894) (applying this term).Â  â€œValuable floatageâ€ is not determined by what\r\n  specific size or class of vessel or object can achieve buoyancy in the\r\n  waterway; rather, the term is defined broadly to include any legitimate and\r\n  beneficial use, whether commercial or recreational.Â  Whiteâ€™s Mill Colony,\r\n    Inc. v. Williams, 363 S.C. 117, 125, 609 S.E.2d 811, 815 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\n\tAs\r\n  we have previously stated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tSection\r\n  49-1-10 of the South Carolina Code does not change the definition of navigable\r\n  waters, but merely emphasizes the law already declared and set out in Heyward\r\n    v. Farmers Mining Company, 42 S.C. 138, 19 S.E. 963 (1894). Â The Court in \r\n\t\tHeyward rendered a thorough pronouncement of the law of navigability. Â As noted in \r\n\t\tHeyward, the common law doctrine that the navigability of a stream is to be determined\r\n  by the ebb and flow of the tide was repudiated in South Carolina in the case of \r\n\t\tState v. Pacific Guano Co., 22 S.C. 50 (1884).\r\n\t\tThe Court\r\n  clarified in Heyward v. Farmers Mining Company, 19 S.E. at 971, that neither\r\n    the character of the craft nor the relative ease or difficulty of navigation\r\n    are tests of navigability. Â The surroundings (e.g. marshland) need not be\r\n  such that it may be useful for the purpose of commerce nor that the stream is\r\n  actually being so used. Â The Court points out a distinction between navigable\r\n  waters of the United States and navigable waters of the State. Â In order to be\r\n  navigable under the United States, the water must connect with other water\r\n  highways so as to subject them to the laws of interstate commerce. Â This is not\r\n  a requirement for navigability of waters under the control of the State.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    State ex rel. Medlock, 289 S.C. at 449, 346 S.E.2d at 719 (emphasis added).\r\nAccess\r\n  at all times is not required for the waters to be navigable.Â  In Hughes v.\r\n    Nelson, the Court of Appeals held a canal was navigable despite the fact\r\n  that, â€œ[a]t certain times of the year, the canal has very little water in it,\r\n  making access difficult.â€Â  Hughes, 303 S.C. at 104, 399 S.E.2d at 25.Â \r\n  The canal was approximately fifteen feet wide and twelve feet deep and had been\r\n  used by the public for fishing and recreation, but not commercial traffic.Â \r\n  Nelson blocked the opening to the canal and argued it was not navigable because\r\n  â€œthe canal cannot sustain boat traffic or be fished for certain periods during\r\n  the year because of insufficient depth.â€Â  Id. at 106, 399 S.E.2d at 26.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  rejecting the argument the canal was not navigable, the Court of Appeals\r\n  stated:Â  â€œThe test of navigability is not whether a waterway is accessible at\r\n  all times.Â  Rather, the test is whether it is accessible â€˜at the ordinary stage\r\n  of the water.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting State v. Columbia Water Power Co.,\r\n  82 S.C. 181, 186, 63 S.E. 884, 888 (1909)).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  â€œ[i]n order that the stream or body of water be classed as navigable, it need\r\n  not be navigable in its entirety.â€Â  65 C.J.S. Navigable Waters Â§ 7\r\n  (2000).Â  â€œIn other words, a stream or body of water which is susceptible of\r\n  being used in its ordinary condition as a highway of commerce may be navigable\r\n  regardless of whether it admits the passage of boats at all portions thereof,\r\n  and the general character of a stream as being navigable is not changed by the\r\n  fact that at a particular place it is not in fact navigable by boats.â€Â  Id. Â \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the ALJ specifically stated that â€œthe waters of the tributary in\r\n  front of [Landownersâ€™] property are nagivable,â€ but nevertheless\r\n  concluded that â€œthe waterway itself is not navigable because the mouth of\r\n    the tributary cannot safely be entered at the ordinary stages of the tide.Â \r\n  This case presents exceptional facts because the safety of the navigation varies\r\n  depending upon the winds, tide, currents, etc.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  The ALJ\r\n  referred to the test for navigability, but added the additional qualification\r\n  that navigation of the waterway must not be so impeded as to create a frequent\r\n  hazard.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  fact that the mouth of the tributary has a man-made impediment does not render\r\n  the entire tributary nonnavigable.Â  â€œThe navigability of water does not depend\r\n  on its actual use for navigation, but on its capacity for such use . . . .Â \r\n  [T]he definition of navigable water embraces, not only that which is actually\r\n  used, but that which is susceptible of use for navigation in its ordinary\r\n  state.â€Â  State ex rel. Lyon, 82 S.C. at 187, 63 S.E. at 888.Â  In State\r\n    ex rel. Lyon, we held that the fact that a waterway ceased to be passable\r\n  because a lock at the Broad River terminus had been so neglected that it could\r\n  not be used did not render the waterway nonnavigable as the waterway was\r\n  capable of navigation up to the lock.Â  Id. \r\nAs\r\n  the dissent noted in the current appeal, the test for navigability does not\r\n  hinge on the existence of man-made impediments or other obstructions, and these\r\n  impediments do not cause the waterway to lose its characterization as\r\n  navigable.[6]Â  See 65 C.J.S. Navigable Waters Â§ 8 (2000) (â€œAs a general rule a\r\n  stream or other body of water is not rendered nonnavigable because of\r\n  occasional difficulties attending navigation.Â  The existence of occasional\r\n  natural obstructions do not destroy the navigability of a river.Â  So, a stream\r\n  may be navigable despite the obstruction of falls, rapids, sand bars, carries,\r\n  or shifting currents.Â  Artificial obstructions which are capable of being\r\n  abated by the due exercise of pubic authority do not prevent a stream from\r\n  being regarded as navigable . . . .â€ (footnotes omitted)); see also State\r\n    v. Head, 330 S.C. 79, 89, 498 S.E.2d 389, 394 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œ[T]he\r\n  existence of occasional natural obstructions to navigation, such as rapids or\r\n  falls, or the construction of authorized or unauthorized artificial\r\n  obstructions to navigation, such as dams, generally does not change the\r\n  character of an otherwise navigable stream.â€).\r\nThe\r\n  ALJâ€™s factual findings are not in dispute in this case, but his conclusions as\r\n  to navigability were based on not only the facts, but also his interpretation\r\n  of the legal test for navigability.Â  See 65 C.J.S. Navigable Waters Â§ 3 (2000) (â€œEach determination as to navigability must rest on the facts and\r\n  circumstances of the particular case.Â  To these facts and circumstances,\r\n  however, certain judicial standards are to be applied for determining whether\r\n  the complex of conditions with respect to the capacity of the water . . .\r\n  renders it a navigable stream.â€).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  ALJ essentially found the tributary was navigable but for the Atkinson dock;\r\n  however, our precedent establishes that the entire tributary did not lose its\r\n  navigability merely because there was an impediment that made access at the\r\n  mouth of the tributary where it joined the Bohicket River more difficult.Â  See State v. Head, 330 S.C. at 91, 498 S.E.2d at 395 (holding the judge\r\n  applied an erroneous test of navigability by agreeing that the creek in\r\n  question was navigable except for a â€œstopping pointâ€ such as a dam that\r\n  prevented navigability); see also 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters Â§ 125\r\n  (2002) (â€œOnce a waterway has been deemed navigable, it remains so; it retains\r\n  its navigable status, even though it is . . . presently incapable of use\r\n  because of changed conditions or the presence of obstructions.â€).Â  Thus, we\r\n  hold the ALJ committed an error of law in assessing navigability in this case\r\n  and that the Court of Appeals decision should be reversed.\r\nC.Â  Atkinson Dock\r\nFinally,\r\n  we note that the Court of Appeals correctly observed in its majority opinion\r\n  that the cause of this entire litigation is the location of the Atkinson dock,\r\n  which has made traversing the mouth of the tributary where it meets the Bohicket River more difficult.Â  Brownlee, 372 S.C. at 128, 641 S.E.2d at 49.Â  As that\r\n  court remarked, â€œThe dock remains to this day in the same place, still impeding\r\n  navigation.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  believe this is a prime example of an â€œ[a]rtificial obstruction[] which [is]\r\n  capable of being abated by the due exercise of public authority,â€ 65 C.J.S. Navigable\r\n    Waters Â§ 8, and we are bewildered as to why DHEC has allowed the Atkinson\r\n  dock to remain in this location since 1991.Â  After Atkinson built his nonconforming\r\n  dock, he requested an as-built permit, but the request was promptly denied and\r\n  Atkinson was advised that enforcement proceedings would be commenced to require\r\n  the dock to be brought into compliance.Â  Although an administrative order was\r\n  issued on November 22, 1991 directing Atkinson to relocate the dock within\r\n  thirty days, the record on appeal revealed no further action taken in this\r\n  regard.\r\nDHEC\r\n  opined during oral argument that its failure to require compliance could have\r\n  arisen from a general lack of resources, particularly its inability to perform on-site\r\n  inspections for every permit application.Â  However, an on-site inspection was already\r\n  conducted by DHEC in 1991 that revealed the dock was not in compliance.Â  Thus, DHEC\r\n  needed only to follow up on its own directives.Â  After oral argument in this\r\n  matter, DHEC investigated further and subsequently submitted a letter from the\r\n  Coastal Council to Atkinson dated October 27, 1992 advising him that it had\r\n  amended Atkinsonâ€™s permit and had approved the â€œas-builtâ€ dock.Â  No explanation\r\n  is provided as to why Atkinsonâ€™s dock was approved in this manner.Â  We note the\r\n  unnecessary litigation that has been spawned with this case and several others by\r\n  the location of the Atkinson dock constitutes a waste of valuable judicial\r\n  resources.Â  Public funds would have been better spent in enforcing compliance\r\n  rather than engaging in protracted litigation to resolve what is essentially a dispute\r\n  among neighbors.\r\nSection\r\n  49-1-10 of the South Carolina Code declares that obstruction of a stream is a\r\n  â€œnuisance and such obstruction may be abated as other public nuisances are by\r\n  law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 49-1-10 (Supp. 2008).Â  We strongly believe that equal\r\n  enforcement of the rules and regulations and compliance with the law by all\r\n  parties is absolutely essential to avoiding precisely the problems generated\r\n  here.\r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the forgoing, we find the ALJ committed legal error in reversing the\r\n  Appellate Panel and that DHECâ€™s denial of the permit requests should be\r\n  reinstated.Â  However, we urge DHEC to take the proper steps to prevent\r\n  additional unnecessary litigation in this regard.Â  The decision of the Court of\r\n  Appeals is, hereby,\r\n\r\nREVERSED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., and\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in\r\n  a separate opinion in which WALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I join the majority except as to Part 3 C captioned\r\n  â€œAtkinson Dockâ€ and the second sentence of the Conclusion urging DHEC\r\n  â€œto take proper steps to prevent additional unnecessary litigation.â€ As I read\r\n  this record, we are not asked, nor do we have any basis, to comment upon\r\n  Coastal Councilâ€™s decision to amend the permit and approve the â€œas-builtâ€ dock,\r\n  to scold DHEC, to imply that the dock constitutes a â€œpublic nuisance,â€ or to\r\n  suggest that there has been an unequal enforcement of rules and regulations.Â \r\n  In my opinion, an appellate court must confine its discussion as narrowly as\r\n  possible solely to the issues properly presented for its consideration.Â  As\r\n  Chief Judge Sanders famously wrote, â€œ[A]ppellate courts in this state . . . .\r\n  do not answer questions they are not asked.â€Â  Langley v.

Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 30-12(A)(1)(n) (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).Â  DHEC notes that under\r\n  either version of the regulation - the one in effect when the permits were\r\n  first considered or the current regulation - DHEC would deny the permit\r\n  applications.Â  Under the current regulation, access must be prohibited by a man-made or natural restriction to warrant an exception, and the parties\r\n  acknowledge that access is not prohibited at this time.Â  Landowners\r\n  argue there was an intervening version of the regulation that allowed a\r\n  navigable creek to be bridged if the creek merely had impeded access, so the\r\n  permits should be granted.Â  However, we find this argument is unavailing as it\r\n  is clear that this prior version, which existed for a limited time, is not\r\n  applicable in this case and it does not mandate granting of the permits, in any\r\n  event. \r\n[3]Â  The name has since changed to the Administrative Law Court. \r\n[4]Â  In 1991, as Atkinson was building his dock, the\r\n  South Carolina Coastal Council, the predecessor to DHECâ€™s OCRM, discovered\r\n  through a neighborâ€™s report and an on-site inspection that he was not in\r\n  compliance with the dock permit he had been issued.Â  Atkinson requested\r\n  authorization for construction of the dock â€œas-built.â€Â  By letter dated\r\n  September 4, 1991, DHEC denied the request, finding the location of the dock is\r\n  substantially different from that originally permitted and that it â€œpresents a\r\n  hazard to navigation both in its proximity to the mouth of the tributary and in\r\n  its channelward extension.â€Â  Atkinson was advised in the letter that\r\n  enforcement proceedings would be instituted to bring the dock into compliance.Â \r\n  On November 22, 1991, the Coastal Council issued an Administrative Order\r\n  finding the Atkinson dock was not in compliance with the permit and instructing\r\n  Atkinson to relocate the dock within thirty days.Â  However, there is no\r\n  indication in the record that any enforcement action was ever taken.Â  At oral\r\n  argument, we asked DHEC for further information about the status of the\r\n  Atkinson dock.Â  DHEC subsequently provided a letter dated October 27, 1992 from\r\n  the Coastal Council to Atkinson advising Atkinson that his â€œpermit has been\r\n  amended to authorize the â€˜as-builtâ€™ dockâ€ and that the amendment closed the\r\n  â€œenforcement fileâ€ in this case.Â  Atkinson was advised, however, that â€œ[t]his\r\n  letter does not relieve you of your responsibility of acquiring any other\r\n  applicable federal or local permits that may be required.â€Â  \r\n[5]Â  The review procedure under the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act was changed by 2006 South Carolina Laws Act No. 387, which\r\n  eliminated the review of the ALJâ€™s determination by the Appellate Panel.Â  Chem-Nuclear\r\n    Sys. v. South Carolina Bd. of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 374 S.C. 201,\r\n  648 S.E.2d 601 (2007).Â  However, this appeal continues under the prior\r\n  procedure.\r\n[6]Â  In his original order the ALJ found the tributary\r\n  was navigable at mid-tide and higher and it was possible to easily navigate\r\n  around the Atkinson dock, though the dock presented a hazard:Â  â€œWhile the\r\n  tributary itself can be navigated at mid-tide and higher, the â€˜theadâ€™ of the\r\n  stream goes underneath the Atkinson dock and is an impediment to boaters\r\n  attempting to enter or exit the tributary.Â  Though it is possible to easily\r\n  navigate around the dock, as reflected by the experience of the OCRM staff,\r\n  that ease of navigation is dependent upon unpredictable winds and currents.Â \r\n  Therefore, I find that the Atkinson dock as it is currently situated presents a\r\n  frequent hazard to safe navigation in and out of the tributary at the ordinary\r\n  tides due to the location of the channel of the tributary under the Atkinson\r\n  dock, the existence of the sand bar/mud flat on the side of the mouth opposite\r\n  the Atkinson dock, and the prevailing winds and currents.â€Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26621","title":"Kiriakides v.

Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-70 (1991)â€ allowing the School District to\r\n  enter upon the property to make a survey, to determine the location of proposed\r\n  improvements, and to prepare an appraisal.Â Â Â  \r\nDue to the workload\r\n  of the appraiser, the appraisal was first given to the School District in late\r\n  July 2002.Â  On or about August 12, 2002, the School District served Kiriakides\r\n  with a â€œCondemnation Notice and Tender of Paymentâ€ pursuant to the South\r\n  Carolina Eminent Domain Procedure Act.[2]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  School District never filed the condemnation action with the court, however,\r\n  because on August 23, 2002, Kiriakides instituted the current action\r\n  challenging the right of the School District to condemn his property.Â  In his\r\n  pleadings, Kiriakides additionally sought damages for inverse condemnation and\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees, alleging â€œ[t]he stigmatization of [his] property as well as\r\n  the unreasonable delay in commencing condemnation [proceedings] has amounted to\r\n  an inverse condemnation of [his] property.â€Â  \r\nIn May\r\n  2003, because of the urgency of the school construction project and the\r\n  existence of this litigation challenging the right to proceed with\r\n  condemnation, the School District notified Kiriakides that it had abandoned its\r\n  efforts to condemn the property.Â  The School District ultimately purchased a\r\n  different piece of property located nearby.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  in December 2005, the master held a bench trial regarding Kiriakidesâ€™s\r\n  complaint.Â  By order filed May 4, 2006, the master ruled in favor of the School\r\n  District, finding as follows:Â  (1) Kiriakidesâ€™s challenge to the School\r\n  Districtâ€™s right to condemn his property was moot because the School District\r\n  had abandoned its condemnation efforts; (2) any challenge to the delay in the\r\n  condemnation proceedings was likewise moot and there was no evidence of delay,\r\n  in any event; and (3) Kiriakides had not established his inverse condemnation\r\n  claim and was not entitled to damages.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a post-trial motion and hearing, the master awarded Kiriakides $6,500 in\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to a provision in the South Carolina Eminent Domain Procedure\r\n  Act based on his finding that the School District had â€œabandoned its\r\n  condemnation efforts.â€Â  This cross appeal followed.Â  \r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Kiriakides challenges the masterâ€™s ruling in favor of the School\r\n  District on his claim for inverse condemnation, and the School District challenges\r\n  the masterâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees to Kiriakides.\r\nA.Â  KIRIAKIDESâ€™S APPEAL\r\nKiriakides contends\r\n  the master erred in denying his claim for inverse condemnation.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  concept of inverse condemnation was originally conceived as a remedy for the\r\n  physical taking of private property without following eminent domain\r\n  procedures.â€Â  11A Eugene McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations Â§\r\n  32.132.20 (3d ed. 2000) (citing, inter alia, Woods v. State,\r\n  314 S.C. 501, 431 S.E.2d 260 (Ct. App. 1993)).Â  â€œInverse condemnation is,\r\n  therefore, a cause of action against a governmental defendant to recover the\r\n  value of property which has been taken in fact by a governmental entity\r\n  although not through eminent domain procedures.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œOne basic difference between condemnation and inverse condemnation is that in condemnation proceedings, the governmental\r\n  entity is the moving party, whereas, in inverse condemnation, the property owner is the\r\n  moving party.â€Â  South Carolina\r\n    State Highway Depâ€™t v. Moody,&nbsp;267 S.C. 130, 136, 226 S.E.2d 423,\r\n  425&nbsp;(1976).Â  \r\nA\r\n  landowner has the burden of proving damages for the taking of the landownerâ€™s\r\n  property, whether through condemnation proceedings or by inverse condemnation.Â  Brenco v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 377 S.C. 124, 128, 659 S.E.2d\r\n  167, 169 (2008) (citing Owens v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 239\r\n  S.C. 44, 54, 121 S.E.2d 240, 245 (1961)).\r\nNot all\r\n  damages that are suffered by a private property owner at the hands of the\r\n  governmental agency are compensable.Â  Woods v. State, 314 S.C. 501, 504,\r\n  431 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  The property itself must suffer some\r\n  diminution in substance, or it must be rendered intrinsically less valuable.Â  Id. \r\nâ€œ[I]n\r\n  an inverse condemnation case, the trial judge will determine whether a claim\r\n  has been established; the issue of compensation may then be submitted to a jury\r\n  at either partyâ€™s request.â€Â  Cobb v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp.,&nbsp;365\r\n  S.C. 360, 365, 618 S.E.2d 299, 301&nbsp;(2005).\r\nInverse\r\n  condemnation claims can result from two instances:Â  â€œAn inverse condemnation\r\n  may result from the governmentâ€™s physical appropriation of private property, or\r\n  it may result from government-imposed limitations on the use of private\r\n  property.â€Â  Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 656, 620 S.E.2d 76,\r\n  79&nbsp;(2005).\r\nIn\r\n  the second instance, where there is a regulatory inverse condemnation, there\r\n  are two elements that must be shown:Â  (1) affirmative conduct, and (2) a\r\n  taking.Â  Id. at 657, 620 S.E.2d at 80.Â  The analysis of whether a taking\r\n  has occurred is governed by the case of Penn Central Transportation Co. v.\r\n    City of New York, 438 U.S. 104 (1978) when the claim stems from an\r\n  allegation of a temporary denial of less than all economically viable use of\r\n  the property.Â  Id. at 658, 620 S.E.2d at 80.Â  â€œIn the context of a\r\n  regulatory delay, the Penn Central inquiry is whether the delay ever\r\n  became unreasonable.â€Â  Id. at 81, 620 S.E.2d at 660.Â  â€œUntil regulatory\r\n  delay becomes unreasonable, there is no taking.â€Â  Id. Â \r\nAs enumerated\r\n  in Byrd, two circumstances are particularly important:Â  (1) the economic\r\n  impact on the claimant, especially the extent to which the governmental entity\r\n  has interfered with the claimantâ€™s investment-backed expectations, and (2) the\r\n  character of the governmental action.Â  Id. at 659, 620 S.E.2d at 80\r\n  (citing Penn Central, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978)).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the case now before us, the parties conceded, and the master specifically\r\n  found, that there was never any physical occupation or appropriation of\r\n  Kiriakidesâ€™s property, the first type of taking under Byrd.Â  Rather,\r\n  Kiriakides asserted the stigmatization of his property by the threat of\r\n  condemnation amounted to a regulatory inverse condemnation under the\r\n  second prong of Byrd.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  rejecting this assertion of a regulatory inverse condemnation, the master found\r\n  there was no act and no taking by the School District that would come within\r\n  the parameters of an inverse condemnation claim.Â  The master noted:Â  â€œThe\r\n  parties agree that the School District never imposed any regulations or\r\n  restrictions on the property of Mr. Kiriakides.Â  The School Districtâ€™s\r\n  pre-condemnation activities and the service of the Condemnation Notice and\r\n  Tender of Payment to Mr. Kiriakides certainly did not give rise to a taking,\r\n  regulatory or otherwise.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  master stated that â€œ[a] regulatory taking by its very nature\r\n  necessitates the existence of some regulation, statute, ordinance, zoning law,\r\n  or similar rule of law that impacts a landownerâ€™s use of his property.Â  In\r\n  other words, regulatory takings exist only in conjunction with affirmative\r\n  governmental restrictions on the use of land.â€Â  The master further stated:Â  â€œSuch\r\n  was the essence of the Byrd case, where Mr. Byrdâ€™s property was\r\n  restricted by zoning regulations, and in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal\r\n    Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992)[,] where land use restrictions constituted a\r\n  regulatory taking.Â  That does not exist in this case.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  master additionally observed his conclusion was supported by public policy, namely,\r\n  the construction of public projects would be severely impeded if the government\r\n  incurred liability for inverse condemnation as a result of merely announcing\r\n  plans to condemn, citing National By-Products, Inc. v. City of Little Rock,\r\n  916 S.W.2d 745, 749 (Ark. 1996) (â€œConstruction of public-works projects would\r\n  be severely impeded if the government could incur inverse condemnation\r\n  liability merely by announcing plans to condemn property in the future.â€); Santini\r\n    v. Connecticut Hazardous Waste Management Service, 739 A.2d 680, 691 (Conn.\r\n  1999) (â€œ[I]f the government were to be considered as having accomplished a\r\n  compensable taking as a result of mere planning that, because of its publicity,\r\n  harmed the value of property, public planning would be discouraged . . . .â€); City\r\n    of Buffalo v. J. W. Clement Co., 269 N.E.2d 895, 903-04 (N.Y. 1971)\r\n  (stating the threat of condemnation generally does not constitute a taking and\r\n  any changes in value are incidents of ownership).Â  The master stated that\r\n  Kiriakidesâ€™s arguments, â€œif accepted, would have a devastating impact on government\r\n  and its citizens.â€Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree\r\n  with the masterâ€™s determination that Kiriakides did not establish a claim for\r\n  inverse condemnation.Â  We find no merit to his arguments that the mere threat\r\n  of a condemnation suit stigmatized his property and that the School Districtâ€™s alleged\r\n  delay in bringing this action entitled him to damages for an inverse\r\n  condemnation.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court of the United States has held that the â€œimpairment of the market\r\n  value of real property incident to otherwise legitimate government action\r\n  ordinarily does not result in a taking.â€Â  Kirby Forest Indus. v. United States, 467 U.S. 1, 15 (1984).Â  In Kirby Forest, the Supreme Court concluded\r\n  the landowner â€œfailed to demonstrate that its\r\n  interests were impaired in any constitutionally significant way before the\r\n  Government tendered payment and acquired title in the usual course.â€Â  Id. at 16. \r\nThe\r\n  mere institution of condemnation proceedings does not constitute a taking, as\r\n  it is a legitimate exercise of the governmentâ€™s authority.Â  See generally 29A C.J.S. Eminent Domain Â§&nbsp;90 (2007) (stating the mere planning in\r\n  anticipation of a public improvement is not an actionable taking of property);\r\n  J. R. Kemper, Annotation, Plotting or Planning in Anticipation of\r\n    Improvement as Taking or Damaging of Property Affected, 37 A.L.R.3d 127\r\n  (1971 &amp; Supp. 2008) (discussing acts performed in preparation for and as\r\n  part of condemnation proceedings and the imposition of liability therefor).\r\nThe\r\n  evidence shows that the School District and Kiriakides engaged in extensive\r\n  negotiations concerning a voluntary sale of the property until at least April\r\n  2002.Â  During this time, no public action was taken by the School District that\r\n  would â€œstigmatizeâ€ the property as Kiriakides alleges, as the communications\r\n  were solely with Kiriakides and there was no public filing of a condemnation\r\n  action.Â  The first public communication occurred when Kiriakides refused to\r\n  allow an appraiser to enter his property and the School District filed a motion\r\n  in April 2002 seeking an order allowing entry.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  when negotiations failed, the School District followed the statutory procedures\r\n  for an eminent domain action and served a notice of condemnation in August\r\n  2002.Â  Kiriakides challenged the School Districtâ€™s right to condemn within\r\n  thirty days of being served with notice by the School District by filing the\r\n  current, separate action, as was his right under state law, which stayed the\r\n  condemnation proceedings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-470 (2007) (providing\r\n  an â€œaction [challenging a condemnorâ€™s right to condemn] must be commenced\r\n  within thirty days after service of the Condemnation Notice upon the landownerâ€\r\n  and that â€œ[a]ll proceedings under the Condemnation Notice are automatically\r\n  stayed until the disposition of the action, if any, unless the landowner and\r\n  the condemnor consent otherwiseâ€).\r\nWe\r\n  discern no unreasonable delay or bad faith conduct on the part of the School District in this matter.Â  The School District never tried to obtain possession of\r\n  Kiriakides land, and until Kiriakides refused to allow an appraiser on his\r\n  property, it had made no public filing in this case. Â If anything, Kiriakidesâ€™s\r\n  failure to cooperate with the School Districtâ€™s efforts to obtain an appraisal\r\n  and his challenge to the School Districtâ€™s right to condemn extended these proceedings.Â \r\n  Further, Kiriakides presented no evidence of damages.Â  He offered no proof that\r\n  the value of his property was diminished or that he lost any potential sales of\r\n  his property due to the proceedings.Â  In fact, Kiriakides admitted that he had\r\n  not tried to sell his property during this time. \r\nThe School Districtâ€™s actions were part of the statutorily-mandated process for condemnation,\r\n  and did not constitute an unreasonable delay in these circumstances that would\r\n  establish a compensable claim.Â  See Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc.\r\n    v. Tahoe Regâ€™l Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 335 (2002) (â€œA rule that\r\n  required compensation for every delay in the use of property would render\r\n  routine government processes prohibitively expensive or encourage hasty\r\n  decision-making.â€); Woods, 314 S.C. at 504, 431 S.E.2d at 262 (holding not\r\n  all damages suffered by private property owners at the hands of the government\r\n  are compensable).Â  The nine-month period between the time the School District\r\n  served notice of the condemnation in August 2002 until it notified Kiriakides\r\n  in writing in May 2003 that it was abandoning the condemnation proceeding due\r\n  to Kiriakidesâ€™s opposition and the need to proceed with the project did not\r\n  establish a taking.Â  Cf. Byrd, 365 S.C. at 661-63, 620 S.E.2d at 82\r\n  (finding an eleven-month delay in evaluating the rezoning of certain property\r\n  did not result in a regulatory taking and inverse condemnation).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  master observed that cases from other jurisdictions overwhelmingly hold that\r\n  normal activities incident to condemnation do not rise to the level of a\r\n  taking.Â  See Joseph M. Jackovich Revocable Trust v. Alaska Depâ€™t of\r\n    Transp., 54 P.3d 294, 302 (Alaska 2002) (stating â€œthere is no indication\r\n  the state did anything more than make announcements, prepare and publish plans,\r\n  and provide publicity concerning the projectâ€ and no evidence the state\r\n  interfered with the property rights of the landowners); City of Chicago v.\r\n    Loitz, 295 N.E.2d 478, 480 (Ill. App. Ct. 1973) (observing â€œthe weight of\r\n  authority in other states and in the Federal courts, is that mere planning by a\r\n  governmental body in anticipation of the taking of land for public use and\r\n  preliminary steps taken to accomplish this, without the filing of proceedings\r\n  and without physically taking or actual invasion of the real estate, is not\r\n  actionable by the owner of the landâ€).Â  \r\nTo\r\n  the extent Kiriakidesâ€™s alleges the master improperly considered public policy\r\n  in determining no inverse condemnation occurred in this matter, we find no\r\n  error.Â  The master merely cited this as additional support for his conclusion\r\n  that Kiriakidesâ€™s position was untenable because if it was accepted, the\r\n  government would be faced with inverse condemnation claims every time it\r\n  attempted to survey property and obtain an appraisal, which would preclude the\r\n  government from engaging in normal activities incident to a condemnation.Â \r\n  Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we affirm the masterâ€™s determination that\r\n  Kiriakides did not establish a claim for inverse condemnation. \r\nB.Â  THE SCHOOL DISTRICTâ€™S APPEAL\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In its cross\r\n  appeal, the School District contends the master erred in awarding statutory attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees to Kiriakides.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  the order ruling on Kiriakidesâ€™s complaint, the master found that, â€œbecause the\r\n  School District abandoned its condemnation efforts, that part of the present\r\n  litigation challenging its right to condemn has been rendered moot.â€Â \r\n  Kiriakides filed a post-trial motion seeking a determination whether he was\r\n  entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees, stating he had requested attorneysâ€™ fees in his\r\n  complaint, but the issue was not addressed in the masterâ€™s order.[3]Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the master issued an order on December 5, 2006, finding Kiriakides\r\n  was entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to section 28-2-510(C) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, which allows a landowner costs and fees in the event a condemnor\r\n  abandons a â€œcondemnation actionâ€ as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIf the\r\n  condemnor abandons or withdraws the condemnation action in the manner\r\n  authorized by this chapter, the condemnee is entitled to reasonable attorney\r\n  fees, litigation expenses, and costs as determined by the court.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-510(C)\r\n  (2007) (emphasis added). Â Â Â \r\nThe master\r\n  concluded a reasonable fee would be $6,500, which â€œfairly represents the\r\n  portion of the fees in this case that were necessarily related to the issues of\r\n  abandonment or withdrawal of the condemnation action by the Defendant.â€[4]Â \r\n  On appeal, the School District contends this was error.\r\nThe\r\n  decision to award or deny attorneysâ€™ fees under a state statute will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Layman v. State, 376\r\n  S.C. 434, 444, 658 S.E.2d 320, 325&nbsp;(2008).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the conclusions of the trial court are either controlled by an error of\r\n  law or are based on unsupported factual conclusions.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œSimilarly,\r\n  the specific amount of attorneysâ€™ fees awarded pursuant to a statute\r\n  authorizing reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees is left to the discretion of the trial\r\n  judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Id.\r\n(1)\r\n  Â Applicability of Section 28-2-510(C).\r\nThe School District\r\n  argues the master erred in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees to Kiriakides under section\r\n  28-2-510(C) of the South Carolina Eminent Domain Procedure Act because the\r\n  statute is inapplicable. Â The School District asserts that, although it served Kiriakides with a Condemnation Notice and Tender of Payment, it never filed the notice with the circuit court; therefore, the action was never commenced.Â  Consequently,\r\n  it is not liable for attorneysâ€™ fees for the abandonment of a â€œcondemnation\r\n  action.â€\r\nThe master rejected\r\n  this argument, finding â€œunder the unique facts of this case,â€ a party is\r\n  entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees if the condemnor abandons the action after service of the Condemnation Notice.Â  The master reasoned that â€œ[t]o hold otherwise\r\n  would . . . encourage a governmental entity to serve its Condemnation Notice,\r\n  chill the value of the property, negotiate until it determines that the value\r\n  sought by the landowner is still too high or that another parcel is more\r\n  suitable, and then unilaterally withdraw its Notice with complete impunity\r\n  since a condemnation lawsuit was never filed.Â  All to the detriment of the\r\n  landowner.Â  This certainly cannot be the result intended by our Legislature.â€Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 3 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, a civil action is generally\r\n  deemed commenced by filing and serving a summons and complaint.Â  Rule 3(a),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  Under this rule, both filing and service are required to institute an\r\n  action.Â  See 24 S.C. Juris. Rules of Civil Procedure Â§&nbsp;3.2 (1994)\r\n  (â€œSubpart 3(a) requires both the filing and service of a summons and complaint\r\n  prior to the commencement of a civil action.Â  The South Carolina courts have\r\n  demanded literal compliance with Rule 3(a).â€).\r\nThe\r\n  provisions of the South Carolina Eminent Domain Procedure Act, however, constitute\r\n  the exclusive procedure for condemnation in this state.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  28-2-210 (2007).Â  Moreover, these provisions control over the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Id. Â§ 28-2-120 (â€œIn the event of conflict\r\n  between this act and the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, this act\r\n  shall prevail.â€).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, section 28-2-30(5) specifically states a â€œâ€˜[c]ondemnation actionâ€™\r\n  includes all acts incident to the process of condemning property after the\r\n    service of a Condemnation Notice.â€Â  Id. Â§ 28-2-30(5) (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nThe\r\n  Act also makes reference to service in other provisions.Â  For example, section\r\n  28-2-470 provides that a separate action to challenge the condemnorâ€™s right to\r\n  condemn automatically stays a proceeding for condemnation, and the Act requires\r\n  this separate action to be filed within thirty days after service of the\r\n  Condemnation Notice.Â  Id. Â§ 28-2-470. Â \r\nIn addition, the\r\n  Act defines litigation expenses as those incurred from the time of service of\r\n  the Condemnation Notice, again referencing service:\r\n\r\n\t(14)\r\n  â€œLitigation expensesâ€ means the reasonable fees, charges, disbursements, and\r\n  expenses necessarily incurred from and after service of the Condemnation\r\n    Notice, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees . . . .\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 28-2-30(14) (emphasis added).\r\nThe provisions of\r\n  the Act are unique and thus the commencement of the condemnation action cannot be\r\n  measured in terms of regular civil proceedings:\r\n\r\n\tThe Act\r\n  does not require the issuance of a summons and complaint and the filing of\r\n  responsive pleadings.Â  Rather, the procedure begins with service of a\r\n    condemnation notice.Â  The condemnation notice may be served in any manner\r\n  allowed for serving a summons and complaint in a civil action.Â  \r\n\r\n18 S.C. Juris. Eminent\r\n  Domain Â§ 38 (1993) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).\r\nAlthough there\r\n  are references to filing in the Act,[5] we hold service marks the time for commencement of the action as defined in the\r\n  Act.Â  Thus, we find section 28-2-510(C) is applicable in this instance.Â  \r\n(2)\r\n  Â Contingency Fee Agreement.Â  \r\nThe School District further argues the master erred in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees to Kiriakides\r\n  because he legally owed no fees to his attorneys.Â  One of Kiriakidesâ€™s\r\n  attorneys testified that he and his co-counsel had no written fee agreement with\r\n  Kiriakides, but they did have a contingency fee arrangement with him - their\r\n  understanding was they were to be paid if Kiriakides recovered on his claims.Â \r\n  The attorney acknowledged that they had not billed Kiriakides for any fees and\r\n  that Kiriakides had paid no fees.Â  [R. 44-46]Â  The School District argues that,\r\n  because Kiriakides did not prevail on his inverse condemnation claim and he did\r\n  not obtain a recovery, no attorneysâ€™ fees were legally due, relying upon the\r\n  case of South Carolina Public Service Authority v. Weeks, 201 S.C. 199, 22\r\n  S.E.2d 249 (1942).\r\nIn Weeks,\r\n  we considered a statutory provision allowing attorneysâ€™ fees for the\r\n  abandonment of eminent domain proceedings that provided as follows:\r\n\r\n\tAt any\r\n  time prior to the final conclusion of the condemnation proceeding provided for\r\n  in this Act and prior to entry into possession by such State Authority, it may\r\n  abandon, withdraw or dismiss such condemnation proceedings upon payment by it\r\n  to the owner of all costs and expenses incurred by the owner, and the amount of\r\n  such costs and expenses shall constitute a lien, for the payment thereof, upon\r\n  any award theretofore deposited in said proceeding by said Authority.\r\n\r\nId. at 200-01, 22 S.E.2d at 249.\r\nThe parties in Weeks had a contingency fee agreement to compensate the attorneys one-half of the\r\n  amount recovered over and above what the condemnor offered, but there was no\r\n  recovery obtained as the condemnation proceeding was abandoned.Â  Id. at 202, 22 S.E.2d at 250.Â  Consequently, no fees were owed under the terms of\r\n  the agreement.Â  The trial judge allowed attorneysâ€™ fees, however, on the theory\r\n  of quantum meruit.Â  Id. Â Upon review, we noted that, we found this was\r\n  error, stating: \r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  agreement was for a contingent fee, contingent upon recovery and, incidentally,\r\n  recovery of more than the amount offered for the land by the condemnor.Â  This\r\n  contingency never occurred, the event of recovery did not transpire, because\r\n  the condemnation was abandoned, and the right to that course by the condemnor\r\n  is not challenged.\r\n\t* *\r\n  * * \r\n\tUndoubtedly, generally where an attorney is discharged\r\n  without cause by his client after they have entered into a contingent fee\r\n  agreement, he is entitled to compensation. . . .Â  \r\n\tThe latter, however, is not the case now presented.Â  No\r\n  action on the part of the landowners prevented the happening of the\r\n  contingency; it failed because of the abandonment of the condemnation by the\r\n  appellant.Â  The inevitable result is that the attorneys by force of the terms\r\n  of their contract, voluntarily entered into, are entitled to no compensation.\r\n\r\nId. at 202-03, 22 S.E.2d at 250.\r\nThe master noted\r\n  the holding of the Weeks case, but concluded:Â  â€œNotwithstanding, I find\r\n  that Plaintiff and his attorneys had a reasonable expectation of payment and\r\n  that [section 28-2-510(C)] entitles Plaintiff, as the owner of property which\r\n  was subject to an abandoned condemnation action, to reasonable attorneys[â€™]\r\n  fees.Â  Further, even though an express contract for legal services was not\r\n  entered into, the law in this State is clear that under the facts of a case\r\n  such as this, the law will imply one.â€Â  \r\nKiriakides\r\n  maintains Weeks is distinguishable because the statute there referred to\r\n  â€œall costs and expenses incurred by the owner,â€ which requires the fees to be\r\n  actually incurred, whereas section 28-2-510(C) generally provides for the recovery\r\n  of â€œreasonableâ€ attorneysâ€™ fees, which means the fees need not be actually\r\n  incurred.Â  The South Carolina Eminent Domain Procedure Act, however, defines â€œlitigation\r\n  expensesâ€ as those â€œreasonable . . . expenses necessarily incurred from\r\n  and after service of the Condemnation Notice, including, but not limited to,\r\n  reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-30(14) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the current appeal, Kiriakidesâ€™s attorneys had an unwritten agreement to be\r\n  paid on a contingency basis - essentially they would recover a percentage of\r\n  any award Kiriakides obtained.Â  They included a request for attorneysâ€™ fees in\r\n  their pleadings, but the School District subsequently abandoned its\r\n  condemnation action.Â  As one treatise has stated:\r\n\r\n\tSome courts have denied recovery for attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  which were wholly contingent upon the payment of an award or judgment in the\r\n  condemnation proceeding, when the proceeding was abandoned by the condemnor.Â  [Citing, \r\n\tinter alia, South Carolina Public Service Authority v. Weeks, 201 S.C. 199, 22\r\n  S.E.2d 249 (1942).]Â  However, other courts have held or recognized that the\r\n  recovery of attorneysâ€™ fees in such a situation is not barred by the existence\r\n  of a contingency fee agreement between the property owner and the ownerâ€™s\r\n  attorney, rejecting the\r\n  contention that the contingent nature of the agreement meant that fees were not\r\n  â€œincurredâ€ by the landowner and thus not recoverable.\r\n\r\n2 Robert L.\r\n  Rossi, Attorneysâ€™ Fees Â§ 11:38 (3d ed. 2001) (footnotes omitted).\r\nWe agree\r\n  with the masterâ€™s determination that Kiriakides was entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  under these circumstances. Â We hereby overrule Weeks to the extent that\r\n  it conflicts with section 28-2-510(C), as the obvious intent of this statute is\r\n  to allow a landowner to recover his expenses in the event of abandonment of a\r\n  condemnation proceeding.Â  Further, we see no reason to differentiate situations\r\n  where a party terminates the attorney and those where the condemnor terminates\r\n  the proceeding.Â  Having found the School District abandoned its efforts to\r\n  condemn Kiriakidesâ€™s property, we hold attorneysâ€™ fees were properly awarded.Â  We\r\n  note that on appeal the School District has challenged Kiriakidesâ€™s entitlement\r\n  to attorneysâ€™ fees, but it has not challenged the reasonableness of the\r\n  masterâ€™s award.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the award of attorneysâ€™ fees to\r\n  Kiriakides in the amount of $6,500. \r\nIII. CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we affirm the masterâ€™s determination that Kiriakides has not\r\n  established his claim for inverse condemnation and that Kiriakides is entitled\r\n  to attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to section 29-2-510(C) of the South Carolina Code for\r\n  the School Districtâ€™s abandonment of its condemnation proceeding.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  KITTREDGE, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Alex Kiriakides, Jr. passed away before oral\r\n  argument was held in this matter.Â  This appeal continues via his personal\r\n  representatives.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The Act is codified at S.C.

Mitchell, Op. No. 2006-UP-403 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 11,\r\n  2006).Â  We granted Petitioner a writ of certiorari to review the court of\r\n  appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nOn December 30, 2003, Petitioner Curtis Jerome\r\n  Mitchell entered a Bi-Lo grocery store in Rock Hill.Â  A store employee observed\r\n  Petitioner pick up two twelve-pack cases of chewing tobacco and proceed past\r\n  the point of sale towards the exit without paying.Â  The employee approached\r\n  Petitioner as he reached the exit door and asked him to return the chewing\r\n  tobacco.Â  Petitioner presented a pocket knife and told the employee, â€œGo ahead,\r\n  mother f****r, try something.Â  Iâ€™ll kill you.â€Â  Petitioner then walked out the\r\n  exit door with the chewing tobacco.Â  \r\nPetitioner was\r\n  subsequently apprehended and indicted by the York County grand jury for armed\r\n  robbery.Â  On April 21, 2004, Petitioner was tried before a jury.Â  After the\r\n  state rested its case, Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel moved for directed verdict on\r\n  the grounds that Petitioner completed the crime of larceny before using force\r\n  or intimidation, and therefore did not commit an armed robbery.Â  The trial\r\n  court ruled that a person may be convicted of armed robbery if he arms himself\r\n  at any time during commission of the larceny, and instructed the jury accordingly.Â \r\n  The trial court based its ruling on this Courtâ€™s opinion in State v. Keith,\r\n  283 S.C. 597, 325 S.E.2d 325 (1985).Â  The jury returned a guilty verdict.Â  \r\nOn appeal to the\r\n  court of appeals, Petitioner argued that: (1) the trial court erred by refusing\r\n  to grant Petitionerâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the charge of armed\r\n  robbery, where the evidence showed that Petitioner had completed the larceny\r\n  prior to the threat of force; and (2) the trial court erred in instructing the\r\n  jury that a robber need not be armed at all times during the commission of the\r\n  larceny in order to be guilty of armed robbery.Â  The court of appeals affirmed\r\n  the trial court, holding that armed robbery may be proved by showing that the\r\n  defendant became armed before asportation of the property, and that the trial\r\n  court properly instructed the jury that a robber need not be armed at all time\r\n  during the commission of a theft in order to be found guilty of armed robbery.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn criminal cases,\r\n  this Court will review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C.\r\n  41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum,\r\n  338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â  On review, this Court is limited to determining whether the\r\n  trial court abused its discretion. Â State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196,\r\n  200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990).Â  This Court does not re-evaluate the facts\r\n  based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply\r\n  determines whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis \r\nPetitioner argues that the court of appeals\r\n  erroneously affirmed the trial courtâ€™s finding that he was properly charged\r\n  with armed robbery.Â  Petitioner submits that he should have instead been\r\n  charged with separate offenses for petit larceny and assault with intent to\r\n  kill or assault of a high and aggravated nature.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nArmed robbery\r\n  occurs when a person commits robbery while either armed with a deadly weapon or\r\n  alleging to be armed by the representation of a deadly weapon.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 16-11-330 (2003).Â  Included in armed robbery is the lesser included offense\r\n  of robbery, which is defined as â€œthe felonious or unlawful taking of money,\r\n  goods, or other personal property of any value from the person of another or in\r\n  his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 424, 578 S.E.2d 32, 42 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Larceny,\r\n  which is a lesser included offense in the crime of robbery, is defined as the\r\n  felonious taking and carrying away of the goods of another against the ownerâ€™s\r\n  will or without his consent.[1]Â  Id.Â  â€œThus, it is the use or alleged use of a deadly weapon that\r\n  distinguishes armed robbery from robbery, and the employment of force or threat\r\n  of force that differentiates a robbery from a larceny.â€Â  State v. Moore,\r\n  374 S.C. 468, 477, 649 S.E.2d 84, 89 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  \r\nThe central issue\r\n  in the present case involves the determination of at what point asportation\r\n  becomes final so that a larceny may not become a robbery.Â  We considered that\r\n  issue, pursuant to a different set of factual circumstances, in State v.\r\n    Keith, 283 S.C. 597, 325 S.E.2d 325 (1985).Â  In that case, the defendant\r\n  Keith was one of three unarmed men, who accosted the victim as he walked along\r\n  a public street.Â  The men rifled through the victimâ€™s pockets and removed cash\r\n  from his wallet.Â  The men also found the victimâ€™s pocketknife, which they used\r\n  to stab the victim repeatedly.Â  Keith was convicted of armed robbery and on\r\n  appeal argued that the conviction was improper because he did not become armed\r\n  until after he had taken the victimâ€™s money.Â  We disagreed and held that â€œwhen\r\n  a defendant commits robbery without a deadly weapon, but becomes armed with a\r\n  deadly weapon before asportation of the victimâ€™s property, a conviction for\r\n  armed robbery will stand.â€Â  Keith, 283 S.C. at 598-99, 325 S.E.2d\r\n  at 326.Â  We also noted that â€œthe crime of robbery is not completed the moment\r\n  the stolen property is in the possession of the robbers, but may be deemed to\r\n  continue during their attempt to escape.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nPetitioner argues\r\n  that Keith is inapposite to the present case.Â  We disagree.Â  Keithâ€™s\r\n  enduring legacy, which is directly relevant to the present case, is the\r\n  â€œcontinuous offense theory.â€Â  This theory is articulated thoroughly in the\r\n  court of appealsâ€™ opinion in State v. Moore, which involves a set of\r\n  facts nearly identical to the present case.Â  374 S.C. at 478, 649 S.E.2d at\r\n  89.Â  \r\nIn Moore, defendant Moore entered a Wal-Mart, picked up a package of over-the-counter\r\n  medication from a display shelf, and walked toward the exit.Â  A security guard\r\n  followed Moore out of the door and stopped him just outside the door on the\r\n  sidewalk.Â  Moore then brandished a handgun, and the security guard, fearing his\r\n  safety, ended the encounter and returned inside the store.Â  Moore was later\r\n  apprehended and charged with armed robbery.\r\nAt trial, Moore moved for directed verdict on the same grounds raised by Petitioner.Â  Moore argued that he could not be convicted of armed robbery because the asportation of the\r\n  property occurred before the confrontation and no force or threat of force was\r\n  used to take the merchandise.Â  The trial court denied Mooreâ€™s motion on the\r\n  grounds that asportation, a necessary element of armed robbery, continues\r\n  during the escape.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s ruling, and began its analysis with\r\n  the Keith opinion, which it interpreted to support â€œthe continuous\r\n  offense theory.â€Â  This theory â€œprovides that [a robbery] has occurred â€˜not only\r\n  if the perpetrator uses force or intimidation to take possession of the\r\n  property, but also if force or intimidation is used to retain possession\r\n  immediately after the taking, or to carry away the property, or to facilitate\r\n  escape.â€[2]Â  Id. (quoting State v. Meyers, 620 So.2d 1160, 1163 (La. 1993)).Â  As articulated by the court of appeals, the theory supports the proposition\r\n  that â€œa â€˜takingâ€™ is not complete - that is to say, has not come to an end -\r\n  until the perpetrator has neutralized any immediate interference with his or\r\n  her possession.â€Â  Id. at 480, 649 S.E.2d at 90.Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  believe the court of appealsâ€™ opinion in Moore articulates the correct\r\n  view of the law in the present case.Â  This view is in keeping with the majority\r\n  of states and legal authorities.Â  See id. at 480-482, 649 S.E.2d\r\n  at 90 (listing the twenty-seven states to have adopted the continuous offense\r\n  theory by statute and the eight states to have adopted the theory by common\r\n  law).Â  See also Model Penal Code Â§ 222.1(1) (2001) (adopting the\r\n  position that a robbery occurs when force or intimidation is part of the entire\r\n  act, and includes the use of force or intimidation to retain possession of the\r\n  thing taken or to escape or prevent pursuit); 77 C.J.S. Robbery Â§ 4 (2008)\r\n  (â€œAsportation is not confined to a fixed point in time.Â  The taking away is a\r\n  transaction which continues as the perpetrators depart from the place where the\r\n  property was seized, and may, under appropriate circumstances, be deemed to\r\n  continue even after such departure from the place of seizure.â€); 67 Am.Jur.2d\r\n  Robbery Â§ 4 (â€œAlthough the required force or threat of force for the offense of\r\n  armed robbery must either precede or be contemporaneous with the taking of a\r\n  victimâ€™s property, the use of a dangerous weapon at any point in the robbery\r\n  will constitute armed robbery as long as it reasonably can be said to be part\r\n  of a single occurrence.â€).Â Â  \r\nApplied\r\n  to the facts of the present case, the continuous offense theory requires that we\r\n  affirm the court of appeals.Â  It is clear that Petitioner did not complete the\r\n  asportation of the chewing tobacco until after he employed the threat of force\r\n  to secure his escape and retain possession of the goods.Â  Thus, the trial court\r\n  was correct to deny Petitionerâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the charge for\r\n  armed robbery.\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we hereby affirm the decision of the court of appeals.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  The â€œtaking and carrying awayâ€ of goods is often referred to as the element of\r\n  â€œasportation.â€\r\n[2] The rationale for adopting the continuous offense\r\n  theory is to effectuate the purpose of the distinction between larceny and\r\n  robbery:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  purpose of the force or intimidation element of the crime of robbery is to\r\n  distinguish, by imposition of a more severe penalty, those takings which pose a\r\n  greater risk to the victim.Â  The danger to the victim, however, is identical\r\n  whether the force or intimidation is employed against the victim immediately\r\n  before or after the actual taking.\r\n\r\nÂ Id.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26623","title":"State v.

Â Woods now argues it\r\n  was reversible error for the trial court to transfer jury selection from Marion County back to Clarendon County.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen a\r\n  trial judge grants or denies a motion for a change of venue after adequate voir\r\n    dire of prospective jurors, the decision will not be overturned absent\r\n  extraordinary circumstances.Â  State v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  904, cert. denied 128 S.Ct. 622 (2007).Â  The moving party has the burden\r\n  of demonstrating actual juror prejudice.Â  State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C.\r\n  494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990).Â  \r\nA\r\n  mistrial is the equivalent of no trial and leaves the cause pending in the\r\n  circuit court.Â  State v. Smith, 336 S.C. 39, 518 S.E.2d 294 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999).Â  It leaves the parties â€œas though no trial had taken place.â€ Grooms\r\n    v. Zander, 246 S.C. 512, 514, 144 S.E.2d 909, 910 (1965) (rulings of trial\r\n  judge in proceeding ending in mistrial represent no binding adjudication upon\r\n  the parties as the mistrial leaves the parties in status quo ante). Â A court\r\n  ruling as to admissibility and competency of testimony during a trial which is\r\n  later declared a mistrial results â€œin no binding adjudication of the rights of\r\n  the parties.â€ Keels v. Powell, 213 S.C. 570, 572, 50 S.E.2d 704, 705\r\n  (1948).Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Manning, 329 S.C.1, 495 S.E.2d 191 (1997), upon a retrial in a capital\r\n  case, the trial court granted the stateâ€™s motion to change venue from Dillon County to Kershaw County.Â  On appeal, this Court held the trial court â€œabused his\r\n  discretion in granting the Stateâ€™s motion to change venue based on pretrial\r\n  publicity because no evidentiary facts supported a finding of actual juror\r\n  prejudice toward the State.â€Â  Id. at 9, 409 S.E.2d at 195. Â Â However, we\r\n  noted that â€œwe think the better practice is to attempt to seat a jury prior\r\n    to ruling on a motion to change venue based on pretrial publicity.â€Â  Id.Â  (Emphasis supplied).Â Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the case having resulted in a mistrial, it was a nullity and therefore began\r\n  anew when called again for trial.Â  State v. Mills, 281 S.C. 60, 314 S.C.\r\n  324, cert. denied 469 U.S. 930 (1984) (when mistrial occurs because of\r\n  inability of jury to agree on verdict, it is the same as if no trial took place).Â \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in attempting to\r\n  seat a jury from Clarendon County prior to ruling on the motion to change\r\n  venue.Â  \r\nInasmuch as the trial court was able to select an unbiased jury\r\n  pursuant to our mandate in Manning, we find no error.Â  Accord State\r\n    v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d 904, (2007) (grant or denial of change\r\n  of venue after adequate voir dire of prospective jurors will not be\r\n  overturned absent extraordinary circumstances).Â  \r\n2.Â  EXCUSAL OF\r\n  JUROR FOR CAUSE\r\nWoods\r\n  next asserts the trial court erred in excusing Juror Carolyn Hilton for\r\n  cause.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  prospective juror may be excluded for cause when his or her views on capital\r\n  punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties\r\n  as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.Â  State v. Evins,\r\n  373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d 904 (2007); State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283, 621\r\n  S.E.2d 883 (2005), cert. denied 547 U.S. 1133 (2006). When reviewing the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s qualification or disqualification of prospective jurors, the\r\n  responses of the challenged juror must be examined in light of the entire voir\r\n    dire.Â  Id.Â  The determination whether a juror is qualified to serve\r\n  in a capital case is within the sole discretion of the trial judge and is not\r\n  reversible on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence. Â Id.Â  A jurorâ€™s disqualification will not be disturbed on appeal if there is a\r\n  reasonable basis from which the trial court could have concluded the juror\r\n  would not have been able to faithfully discharge his responsibilities as a\r\n  juror under the law.Â  State v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 392 S.E.2d 157, cert.\r\n    denied 498 U.S. 881 (1990).Â  Deference must be paid to the trial court who\r\n  saw and heard the juror. Â Id. Â There will be situations where a trial\r\n  court is left with the definite impression a prospective juror would be unable\r\n  to faithfully and impartially apply the law, and this is why deference must be\r\n  paid to the trial court. Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985).\r\nDuring voir\r\n  dire, Juror Hilton was questioned extensively concerning her views on\r\n  capital punishment.Â  When initially questioned about which type of juror she\r\n  would be,[3] she indicated she would always vote for life imprisonment.Â  When the three\r\n  types of jurors were explained to her again, she indicated she would be the\r\n  third type of juror, indicating she would wait and see before deciding on\r\n  punishment.Â  When the trial court questioned her as to whether, if they got to\r\n  a sentencing phase, she could consider a life sentence, she responded, â€œyes.â€Â \r\n  However, when the court went further and questioned if, depending on the facts\r\n  and circumstances, she could vote to return a verdict imposing the death\r\n  penalty, she replied, â€œno.â€Â  The lawyers then questioned Juror Hilton and she\r\n  reiterated to the solicitor that she could not vote for the death penalty.Â  She\r\n  continued to maintain she would vote for life and could not vote for death.Â \r\n  After some vacillation, she indicated she would not feel comfortable signing a\r\n  death verdict.Â  \r\nDefense\r\n  counsel then examined Juror Hilton, advising her that all twelve jurors would\r\n  have to sign beyond a reasonable doubt to vote for a sentence of death.Â  Hilton\r\n  replied she â€œguessedâ€ she could vote for such a sentence.Â  When questioned\r\n  whether she could, after the vote occurred, confirm her vote on the verdict\r\n  form, she again replied, â€œI guess.â€Â  After further voir dire and much\r\n  vacillation, Juror Hilton ultimately maintained she was a type three juror, and\r\n  felt she could vote for a death sentence and sign the death verdict.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court then meticulously reflected on whether Juror Hilton was qualified;\r\n  the judge was clearly concerned that Juror Hiltonâ€™s initial responses seemed\r\n  adamant in stating she could not vote to impose a death sentence.Â  The trial\r\n  court felt her initial responses that she would not vote for a death sentence\r\n  did not reflect any real confusion.Â  The trial judge ultimately ruled that he\r\n  would re-read the transcript of Juror Hiltonâ€™s testimony before making a ruling\r\n  the next day.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  she was discharged for the evening, Juror Hilton was advised to go home and to\r\n  call a recorded message after 6:00 p.m. the following night to find out when\r\n  she was to return to the courthouse.Â Â  She was also told that when she\r\n  returned, she was to bring with her enough clothing and personal items to stay\r\n  for the seven to ten day duration of trial. Â The next day, the Clerk advised the\r\n  trial judge that Juror Hilton had not come to court, and they had to go out and\r\n  find her.Â  She also failed to bring any clothing or personal items.Â  \r\nAfter further voir dire, the trial court ruled Juror Hilton\r\n  was not qualified to serve, both because of her vacillation over the death\r\n  penalty, and because of her inability to follow the courtâ€™s instructions.Â Â Â  \r\nWoods now asserts Juror Hilton was improperly disqualified\r\n  inasmuch as her views reflect an ability to recommend the death penalty in an\r\n  appropriate case.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially,\r\n  Woods does not challenge the trial courtâ€™s alternate basis for removing Juror\r\n  Hilton, i.e., that she would not follow simple instructions.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  ruling is the law of the case and there is no basis for reversal.Â  Sloan v.\r\n    S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 365 S.C. 299, 618 S.E.2d 876 (2005); South\r\n      Carolina Tax Commâ€™n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 316 S.C. 163, 447\r\n  S.E.2d 843 (1994) (failure to appeal an alternative ground of judgment below\r\n  will result in affirmance). \r\nIn any\r\n  event, the trial court acted within its discretion in disqualifying the juror.Â  Accord State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283, 621 S.E.2d 883 (2005), citing Commonwealth v. Duffey, 855 A.2d 764 (Pa. 2004) (where voir dire indicated juror was somewhat unclear as to her convictions regarding imposition\r\n  of the death penalty, and these concerns could have substantially impaired her\r\n  ability to function as an impartial juror, the trial court was in the best\r\n  position to make that determination and did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  dismissing the prospective juror for cause); State v. Green, supra (the determination of whether a juror is qualified to serve on a death penalty\r\n  case is within the sole discretion of the trial judge and is not reversible on\r\n  appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling on\r\n  this issue is affirmed.[4]\r\nPROPORTIONALITY\r\n  REVIEW\r\nWe have\r\n  conducted a proportionality review pursuant to S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)\r\n  (2003). We find the death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or\r\n  any other arbitrary factor. Furthermore, a review of prior cases shows the\r\n  death sentence in this case is proportionate to that in similar cases and is\r\n  neither excessive nor disproportionate to the crime. See State v. Stanko,\r\n  376 S.C. 571, 658 S.E.2d 94, cert. denied 129 S.Ct. 182 (2008); State\r\n    v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d 904 (2007); State v.

Woods, 376 S.C. 125, 654 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied Oct. 23, 2008.Â  Woods was also tried and convicted of\r\n  burglary, armed robbery and assault and battery with intent to kill in\r\n  connection with a May 27, 2003 attack upon an eighty-four year old Clarendon County woman named Laura Jackson.Â  These convictions were recently affirmed by\r\n  the Court of Appeals.Â  State v. Woods, Op. No. 2008-UP-536 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Sept. 16, 2008).Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  The judge specifically noted the primary reason\r\n  he had granted the motion to change venue in the first trial was due to the\r\n  stateâ€™s consent, and the fact that the state wanted to be able to complete the\r\n  trial in September 2006, before one of the solicitors was leaving to become a judge.Â \r\n  The court ruled that if it had not been for this consideration, the motion to\r\n  move the trial to Marion County would have been denied.Â  \r\n[3]Â  The trial court gave the jury a sheet listing\r\n  the three types of jurors: 1) would always vote for death, 2) would always vote\r\n  for life, or 3) would wait and hear facts and circumstances before deciding on\r\n  punishment.Â  \r\n[4] Â The remaining issues are affirmed pursuant to\r\n  Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Woodsâ€™ Issue 3- Nix\r\n    v.

Â§\r\n  2703(d) and 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3127(2)(B) (2006).Â  The court further found that parts\r\n  of the undercover investigation violated internal policies.Â  The court denied\r\n  Respondentâ€™s Motion to Dismiss but granted Respondentâ€™s Motion to Suppress\r\n  certain evidence obtained pursuant to the orders and evidence obtained by\r\n  methods which violated the policies.Â  The State appealed to this Court.[1]Â \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nFrom\r\n  March 12, 2006 until May 5, 2006, a detective with the Spartanburg County\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Office and member of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force\r\n  (ICAC) chatted on Yahoo! Instant Messenger with an individual using the screen\r\n  name â€œDanger6552000,â€ which also displayed the name â€œRoge Wilson.â€[2]Â \r\n  While chatting, the detective used a profile he created that indicated that the\r\n  person chatting was a thirteen-year-old girl named â€œMelanie.â€[3]Â Â \r\n  The detective testified that many of the chats with Roge from March 12 until\r\n  March 20 were conducted from his personal computer at his home, at times at\r\n  which he was not officially on duty.\r\nIn\r\n  the first chat, Roge noted that Melanie was thirteen years old and made\r\n  sexually explicit comments, attempting to engage Melanie in cybersex.Â  In later\r\n  chats, Roge continued to make sexually explicit comments.Â  Roge stated multiple\r\n  times that he could not engage in actual sexual acts with Melanie until she was\r\n  sixteen years old, but at one point he agreed to come see Melanie and at\r\n  another agreed to meet her at the mall and take her to a hotel room, on both\r\n  occasions for the purpose of having sex with Melanie.\r\nOn\r\n  March 23, the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office requested an order from The Honorable\r\n  G. Thomas Cooper, Chief Administrative Judge for the Fifth Judicial Circuit,\r\n  under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2703(d) to obtain information from Yahoo! related to the\r\n  screen names used by Roge.Â  The State received the IP address[4] from Yahoo! and determined that the address belonged to Bellsouth Internet\r\n  Service.Â  The State then requested another Â§ 2703(d) order to obtain the\r\n  subscriber information and connection logs associated with the IP address,\r\n  which was granted by the Honorable James W. Johnson, Jr.Â  Based on the information\r\n  provided by Bellsouth, the State determined that the screen names used by Roge\r\n  belonged to Respondent.Â  On May 8, the State requested and received another\r\n  order from Judge Cooper to obtain more information about Respondentâ€™s account. \r\nThe\r\n  State indicted Respondent on one count of criminal solicitation of a minor in\r\n  violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-342 (2006).Â  The circuit court held\r\n  pre-trial hearings to deal with various motions made by Respondent.Â  The judge\r\n  granted Respondentâ€™s Motion to Suppress information obtained from the discovery\r\n  orders after finding that the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office did not comply with South Carolina law relating to the issuance of orders for pen registers and trap and trace\r\n  devices. Â As a result, in the view of the trial judge, the South Carolina\r\n  courts were not authorized to issue the orders under Â§ 2703(d).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the trial judge suppressed evidence of the internet chats between Respondent\r\n  and the undercover officer which took place between March 12 and March 20 due\r\n  to the fact that chats during this period were not conducted in compliance with\r\n  ICAC Task Force standards.Â  The State appealed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppellate\r\n  courts are bound by fact findings in response to motions preliminary to trial\r\n  when the findings are supported by the evidence and not clearly wrong or\r\n  controlled by error of law.

Amerson, 311 S.C. 316, 320, 428\r\n  S.E.2d 871, 873 (1993).Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in finding that the South \r\n\t\t\tCarolina courts were not authorized to issue the discovery orders \r\n\t\t\tunder Â§ 2703(d)?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tB. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in suppressing evidence \r\n\t\t\tof chats between March 12 and March 20 due to violations of ICAC policies?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA. Authority to issue Â§\r\n  2703(d) discovery orders\r\nThe\r\n  State connected Respondent to the screen names associated with Roge through the\r\n  use of criminal discovery orders allowed by the federal PATRIOT Act.Â  At the\r\n  circuit court, the State acknowledged that the substantive factual showings\r\n  contained in the applications made to Judge Cooper and Judge Johnson were less\r\n  than the probable cause standard required to obtain an order for a pen register\r\n  or trap and trace device under South Carolina law and that the sole legal\r\n  authority upon which it relied in obtaining each of its discovery orders was 18\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 2703&nbsp; (d).Â  The statute provides:\r\n\r\n\t(d) Requirements for Court Order. - A court order for\r\n  disclosure under subsection (b) or (c) may be issued by any court that is a\r\n  court of competent jurisdiction and shall issue only if the governmental entity\r\n  offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds\r\n  to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the\r\n  records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing\r\n  criminal investigation.Â  In the case of a State governmental authority, such a\r\n  court order shall not issue if prohibited by the law of such State. \r\n\r\n18 U.S.C. Â§ 2703(d) (2006).Â \r\n  The term â€œcourt of competent jurisdictionâ€ is defined in 18 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  3127(2)(B):\r\n\r\n\t(2) the term â€œcourt of competent jurisdictionâ€ means -\r\n\t. . . \r\n\t(B) a court of general criminal jurisdiction of a\r\n  State authorized by the law of that State to enter orders authorizing the use\r\n  of a pen register or a trap and trace device;\r\n\r\n18 U.S.C. Â§ 3127 (2006).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found that the orders were not properly issued because, in his\r\n  view, (1) the issuing courts were not â€œcourt[s] of competent jurisdictionâ€\r\n  since they were not authorized to enter orders authorizing use of a pen\r\n  register or trap device; and (2) South Carolina law prohibits Â§ 2703(d)\r\n  orders.Â  We hold that both findings were legal errors.\r\n(1) Court of competent\r\n  jurisdiction\r\nSection\r\n  2703(d) provides that â€œ[a] court order for disclosure under subsection (b) or\r\n  (c) may be issued by any court that is a court of competent jurisdiction . . .\r\n  .â€ 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2703(d).Â  Section 3127(2)(B) defines a â€œcourt of competent\r\n  jurisdictionâ€ as a â€œcourt of general criminal jurisdiction of a State\r\n  authorized by the law of that State to enter orders authorizing the use of a\r\n  pen register or a trap and trace device.â€ 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3127(2)(B).Â  \r\nThere\r\n  is no dispute that the circuit court qualifies as a court of general criminal\r\n  jurisdiction under the South Carolina Constitution. S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Â§ 17-29-30(A)(2) allows a law enforcement officer of this State to apply for a\r\n  pen register from any circuit court. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-29-30.\r\nNonetheless,\r\n  the circuit court found that the issuing courts were not courts of competent\r\n  jurisdiction because, given that the State admittedly did not show probable\r\n  cause, the courts were not authorized to issue pen registers in the instant\r\n  case.Â  In short, he found that the courts failed the second part of Â§ 3127.Â  This\r\n  was error.\r\nSection\r\n  2703 sets forth standards required in order to obtain information.Â \r\n  Specifically, Â§ 2703(d) requires a showing of â€œspecific and articulable facts\r\n  showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a\r\n  wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought,\r\n  are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.â€ 18 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  2703(d).Â  It is unlikely that Congress intended to require, as a threshold\r\n  matter, that the forum stateâ€™s standard for the issuance of pen devices be met\r\n  and then require that â€œreasonable suspicionâ€ standards of Â§ 2703(d) be met\r\n  before a court order is issued.Â  Moreover, such an interpretation would defeat\r\n  uniformity.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  more logical reading of the statute is that by requiring that applications\r\n  under Â§ 2703(d) be heard by a â€œcourt of competent jurisdictionâ€ Congress meant\r\n  to ensure that the courts deciding whether or not to issue Â§ 2703(d) orders\r\n  were competent to consider whether or not to grant orders of a similar type.Â \r\n  For this reason, we find that the circuit court erred in finding that the South\r\n  Carolina circuit courts were not â€œcourt[s] of competent jurisdictionâ€ for\r\n  purposes of Â§ 2703.\r\n(2) Prohibited by the law\r\n  of such State\r\nThough\r\n  Â§ 2703(d) allows for courts to issue orders for disclosure, it also limits the\r\n  courtâ€™s power to do so where a State governmental authority seeks the order. 18\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 2703(d).Â  In that case, â€œsuch a court order shall not issue if\r\n  prohibited by the law of such State.â€ Id.Â  In addition to finding that\r\n  the issuing courts were not â€œcourts of competent jurisdictionâ€ under Â§ 3127,\r\n  the circuit court found, under Â§ 2703(d), that the orders were prohibited by South Carolina law. \r\nThe\r\n  trial court found Â§ 2703(d) orders were prohibited by S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-29-20(A) (â€œExcept as provided in this section, no person may install or use\r\n  a pen register or trap and trace device without first obtaining a court order\r\n  under Â§ 17-29-40.â€).Â  The fundamental flaw in the trial courtâ€™s reasoning is in\r\n  equating the issuance of pen registers and trap and trace devices with Â§\r\n  2703(d) orders.Â  Section 2703(d) addresses orders issued under subsection (b)\r\n  or (c) of Â§ 2703. 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2703(d).Â  Neither subsection calls for the\r\n  issuance or use of pen registers and/or trap and trace devices.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  information obtained through the use of either subsection is very different\r\n  from the information obtained through the use of a pen register and trap and\r\n  trace device.Â  \r\nA\r\n  pen register or trap and trace device is different from a Â§ 2703(d) order in\r\n  two main ways.Â  First, while Â§ 2703(d) orders seek information retrospectively,\r\n  a pen register or trap and trace device captures information after its\r\n  installation. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-29-10.Â  The devices intercept\r\n  information in transmission while Â§ 2703(d) orders elicit information already\r\n  in the possession of the provider. See 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2703(b), (c).Â  \r\nSecond,\r\n  information obtained by a Â§ 2703(d) order is more specific than information\r\n  obtained through use of a pen register or a trap and trace device.Â  While Â§ 2703(d)\r\n  orders may be limited to a certain subscriber or time period, pen registers and\r\n  trap and trace devices capture all phone numbers dialed from the targeted phone\r\n  line without regard to the relevance to the ongoing investigation. See 68 Am. Jur. 2d Pen Registers Â§ 342 (2008).\r\nBecause\r\n  Â§ 2703(d) orders do not call for issuance of a pen register or trap and trace\r\n  device and allow parties to obtain information different than that obtained by\r\n  a pen register or trap and trace device, we find that Â§Â§ 17-29-10, et seq. does\r\n  not establish that Â§ 2703(d) orders are prohibited by South Carolina law.Â \r\n  Therefore, the trial court erred in finding that the orders were improperly\r\n  issued on this ground. \r\n\r\nB. Suppression due to\r\n  violation of ICAC policies\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court suppressed evidence of the chats between Roge and the undercover\r\n  officer that occurred between March 12 and March 20 due to the officerâ€™s\r\n  non-compliance with the ICAC Program and Investigative Standards (ICAC\r\n  Standards) which were incorporated into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\r\n  between Spartanburg and the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  MOU provides, among other things, that no personally owned equipment should be\r\n  used in ICAC investigations and that only sworn, on-duty ICAC personnel should\r\n  conduct investigations in an undercover capacity.Â  At the pre-trial hearing,\r\n  the undercover officer admitted violating the policies by communicating with Roge\r\n  while the officer was officially off-duty and using his personal computer,\r\n  rather than on ICAC computers.Â  The ICAC computers are equipped with software\r\n  capable of recording various information concerning all communications sent and\r\n  received in the course of undercover investigation.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the violations of the MOU and ICAC Standards go to the weight\r\n  rather than the admissibility of the evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nThis\r\n  Court has held on a number of occasions that violations of procedure go to the\r\n  weight, rather than the admissibility of evidence. See, e.g., State\r\n    v. Huntley, 349 S.C. 1, 562 S.E.2d 472 (2002) (failure to conduct\r\n  breathalyzer test using required sample); State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419,\r\n  544 S.E.2d 835 (2001) (flaw in chain of custody).Â  Moreover, exclusion is\r\n  typically reserved for constitutional violations. See Huntley,\r\n  349 S.C. at 6, 562 S.E.2d at 474 (â€œExclusion of evidence should be limited to\r\n  violations of constitutional rights and not to statutory violations, at least\r\n  where the defendant cannot demonstrate prejudice at trial resulting from the\r\n  failure to follow statutory procedures.â€).\r\nThe\r\n  MOU and ICAC Standards are not codified and were created, not by the\r\n  Legislature, but by law enforcement.Â  The MOU and ICAC Standards serve a variety\r\n  of purposes.Â  We find that the violation of the MOU and ICAC policies speak to\r\n  the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  circuit court erred in suppressing the chats between March 12 and March 20 on\r\n  this basis.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court erred in finding a violation of Â§ 2703(d) and in suppressing\r\n  evidence on that basis and on the basis of violations of ICAC Standards.Â  We\r\n  therefore reverse the circuit court.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The State appealed pursuant to State v.
