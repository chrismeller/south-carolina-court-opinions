County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 622\r\n  S.E.2d 733 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We are called upon to construe the effect of an\r\n  amendment to the Newberry County Zoning Ordinance.Â  The Newberry County Council\r\n  amended the county zoning ordinance on December 11, 2002 by adding a single\r\n  wordâ€”â€œlandfillâ€â€”to a list of uses that may be allowed in what is classified as\r\n  R-2 Rural District.Â  It is undisputed that prior to the amendment, a landfill\r\n  was permitted in R-2 districts only as a â€œspecial exception.â€Â  The question\r\n  before us is whether the single-word amendment to the zoning ordinance effected\r\n  a change in a landfill from a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ to a â€œpermitted use.â€Â  We\r\n  hold the amendment had no effect on the proper use classification of a\r\n  landfill.Â  A landfill remains a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ in R-2 districts.Â  We\r\n  reverse the contrary opinion of the court of appeals.Â  \r\nI.\r\nEagle\r\n  Container owns a 328-acre tract of land in Newberry County which is zoned R-2\r\n  Rural District.Â  On May 16, 2003, Eagle Container applied for a special\r\n  exception to construct and operate a landfill on the property.Â  Before this\r\n  request was acted upon, Eagle Container apparently learned of the amended\r\n  ordinance.Â  On June 2, 2003, it applied for, and received, a permit to operate\r\n  the proposed landfill.Â  Two days later, on June 4, 2003, a representative for Newberry County wrote Eagle Container a letter advising the permit had been issued in error\r\n  and was being revoked.Â  The letter stated, â€œPursuant to Newberry County Zoning\r\n  Ordinance, landfills are permitted only in R-2 [d]istricts as special\r\n  exceptions, which require approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals after a\r\n  hearing.Â  Consequently, I am hereby reinstating the Special Exception\r\n  Application filed on May 16, 2003.â€[1]Â  \r\nOn June\r\n  17, 2003, Eagle Container filed suit, contending a landfill was a â€œpermitted\r\n  useâ€ under the ordinance and, as such, the permit should be reinstated.Â  The\r\n  parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, each contending there were no\r\n  genuine issues as to any material fact.Â  The circuit court granted Eagle\r\n  Container summary judgment, ruling a landfill is a â€œpermitted useâ€ within the\r\n  meaning of the Countyâ€™s recently amended ordinance.Â  The County appealed, and\r\n  the court of appeals affirmed.Â  Eagle Container Co. v. County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 622 S.E.2d 733 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nII.\r\nBecause\r\n  we are called upon to construe the meaning of an unambiguous ordinance, our\r\n  review does not track the fact-based summary judgment review path.[2]Â  Issues\r\n  involving the construction of ordinances are reviewed as a matter of law under\r\n  a broader standard of review than is applied in reviewing issues of fact.Â  Sea\r\n    Island Scenic Parkway Coalition v. Beaufort County Bd. of Adjustments &amp;\r\n    Appeals, 321 S.C. 548, 550, 471 S.E.2d 142, 143 (1996).Â  â€œAlthough great deference is accorded the\r\n  decisions of those charged with interpreting and applying local zoning\r\n  ordinances, â€˜a broader and more independent review is permitted when the issue\r\n  concerns the construction of an ordinance.â€™â€Â  Charleston County Parks &amp;\r\n    Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995)\r\n  (internal citation omitted) (quoting Sea Island Scenic Parkway Coalition v.\r\n    Beaufort County Bd. of Adjustments &amp; Appeals, 316 S.C. 231, 235, 449\r\n  S.E.2d 254, 256 (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  â€œThe determination of legislative intent is\r\n  a matter of law.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nWe begin our analysis with the procedural history which led to the\r\n  December 11, 2002 amendment to the Newberry County Zoning Ordinance that is at\r\n  the center of this dispute.Â  In December 2001, Newberry County adopted Zoning\r\n  Ordinance No. 12-24-01 to provide a comprehensive plan for land uses and\r\n  restrictions in Newberry County.Â  Article 3 of the ordinance establishes zoning\r\n  districts.Â  The various zoning districts were established â€œfor the purposes of\r\n  guiding development . . . and promoting public health, safety, morals,\r\n  convenience, order, appearance, prosperity, and general welfare . . . .â€ \r\nSection 301 sets forth a nonexclusive listing of what uses may be\r\n  allowed in the respective zoning districts. When the ordinance was enacted, R-2\r\n  Rural Districts were defined in section 301 as follows:\r\n\r\n  R-2 districts require large parcels for uses, allow rural and\r\n    residential uses, including manufactured homes on individual lots, agricultural\r\n    and related uses, ranching, recreation and hunting, a variety of government\r\n    service uses, and limited business uses.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  ordinance provides for three classifications of uses that may be permitted:Â  a\r\n  â€œpermitted use,â€ a â€œconditional use,â€ or a â€œspecial exception.â€Â  These terms of\r\n  art are defined in Article 2 of\r\n  the zoning ordinance and are applied to the specific uses in Article 5,\r\n  specifically section 501:\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Permitted Uses:Â  Permitted uses listed in the district\r\n    use tables in this Division are permitted outright. \r\n  2.Â  Conditional Uses:Â  Conditional uses in the district use\r\n    tables are permitted by the Zoning Administrator without further review\r\n    upon compliance with the conditions specified in the tables.\r\n  3. Special Exceptions:Â  Special exceptions are permitted after review and approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon compliance with\r\n    the general conditions in the regulations.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nThe County amended section 301 on December 11, 2002 by adding â€œlandfillâ€\r\n  as a use allowed in R-2 Rural Districts. The amendment reads:\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS,\r\n    Ordinance No. 12-24-01 permits various uses in R&#8209;2 Rural Districts; and\r\n  WHEREAS,\r\n    landfills should be allowed in the R-2 Rural Districts.\r\n  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AS FOLLOWS:\r\n  Article 3, Section 301 is amended to add text â€œlandfillâ€ to\r\n    the uses permitted in R-2 Rural District.Â  The text is added to the Newberry\r\n    County Zoning Ordinance.Â  \r\n\r\n(Last emphasis added.)Â  Â Â \r\nIt\r\n  is undisputed that prior to this amendment a landfill was allowed in R-2\r\n  districts only as a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ under section 501. Â Â Section 501 sets forth the following\r\n  conditions for approval of a landfill within R-2 districts by the Board of\r\n  Zoning Appeals:\r\n\r\n  (1) Approvals shall be conditioned on the applicant receiving all\r\n    state and federal approvals; \r\n  (2) All uses are a minimum of 1,000 feet from adjoining property\r\n    lines;\r\n  (3) The use would not constitute a safety hazard or a traffic\r\n    hazard;\r\n  (4) The use is not detrimental to adjacent land uses in the vicinity.Â  \r\n\r\nWhen Eagle Containerâ€™s post-amendment permit application was\r\n  ultimately treated by the County as an application for a â€œspecial exception,â€\r\n  Eagle Container filed the underlying action in circuit court seeking\r\n  declaratory relief and mandamus.Â  Eagle Container successfully argued in the\r\n  circuit court that the single-word amendment to section 301 changed landfills\r\n  from a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ to a â€œpermitted use.â€Â  The court of appeals\r\naffirmed, from which we granted a writ of certiorari.\r\nThe dispositive question is whether the Newberry County\r\n  Council, in amending section 301, changed landfill from a â€œspecial exceptionâ€\r\nto a â€œpermitted use.â€Â  \r\nWe proceed from the familiar premise that in the area of\r\n  statutory construction, our role is limited to determining legislative intent\r\n  and effectuating that intent.Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are\r\n  subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be\r\n  reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed\r\nin light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â  \r\nâ€œ[W]ords\r\n  in a statute must be construed in context,â€ and â€œthe meaning of particular\r\n  terms in a statute may be ascertained by reference to words associated with\r\n  them in the statute.â€Â  S. Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. S.C. Windstorm &amp; Hail\r\n    Underwriting Assâ€™n, 306 S.C. 339, 342, 412 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1991).Â  â€œThe\r\n  language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter\r\n  and accords with its general purpose.â€Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v.\r\n    Leatherman,&nbsp;309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846&nbsp;(1992).Â  â€œIf a\r\n  statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite\r\n  meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation\r\n  and the court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.â€Â  Miller\r\n    v. Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 447, 441 S.E.2d 319, 321&nbsp;(1994).\r\nBoth the circuit court and the court of appeals construed the\r\n  phrase â€œuses permittedâ€ in the descriptive language of the announcement setting\r\n  forth the amendment as unambiguously reflecting the intent of County Council to\r\n  change the classification of a landfill in R-2 districts from a â€œspecial\r\n  exceptionâ€ to a â€œpermitted use.â€Â  In so ruling, the courts erroneously elevated\r\n  the significance of this prefatory, nonbinding language.Â  In any event, such a\r\n  construction cannot withstand scrutiny, because reference to an allowed use as\r\n  a â€œuse permittedâ€ is not the same thing as the term of art â€œpermitted use.â€[3]Â  In fact, each of the three use\r\n  classifications (permitted, conditional and special exception) incorporates the\r\n  term â€œpermittedâ€ by definition.Â  Referring to any allowed use as a â€œuse\r\n  permittedâ€ sheds no light on the proper classification of the use.Â  Under the\r\n  clear and unambiguous approach utilized by the Newberry County Zoning\r\n  Ordinance, it is section 501, not section 301, that determines whether an\r\n  allowed use is classified as a â€œpermitted use,â€ â€œconditional use,â€ or â€œspecial\r\nexception.â€Â  \r\nMoreover, neither the circuit court nor the\r\n  court of appeals was persuaded by County Councilâ€™s failure to amend section 501\r\n  of the ordinance, which lists a landfill as a special exception.Â  In this\r\n  regard, the court of appeals invoked the principle of â€œlast legislative\r\n  expressionâ€ to confer a landfill as a â€œpermitted use.â€Â  â€œUnder the â€˜last\r\n  legislative expressionâ€™ rule, where conflicting provisions exists, the last in\r\n  point of time or order of arrangement, prevails.â€Â  Ramsey v. County of McCormick, 306 S.C. 393, 397, 412 S.E.2d 408, 410 (1991).Â  The last\r\n  legislative expression rule, however, â€œis purely an arbitrary rule of\r\n  construction and is to be resorted to only when there is clearly an\r\n  irreconcilable conflict, and all other means of interpretation have been\r\n  exhausted.â€Â  Feldman v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 203 S.C. 49, 54, 26 S.E.2d 22,\r\n  24 (1943).Â  Here, there is no irreconcilable conflict.Â  Because Articles 3 and\r\n  5 of the zoning ordinance serve different functions, the amendment at issue\r\n  here creates no conflict as to the proper use classification of a landfill in a\r\nR-2 district.\r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals further held that â€œthe amending ordinance directly contradicts\r\n  section 501â€™s classification of landfills thereby repealing the classification\r\n  and obviating the need to consider the existence of the â€˜special useâ€™\r\n  requirements.â€Â  Eagle Container, 366 S.C. at 626, 622 S.E.2d at 741.Â Â \r\n  From this finding, the court of appeals held that the amendment to section 301\r\n  repealed section 501.Â  Id.Â  This was error, for the reasons noted\r\n  above.Â  Succinctly stated, the addition of the term â€œlandfillâ€ in the listing\r\n  of allowed uses in section 301 creates no conflict within the ordinance.Â \r\n  Article 3 of the zoning ordinance simply does not speak to the proper use\r\n  classification of allowed uses within the various zoning districts; the proper\r\n  use classification is the function of Article 5.Â  Given the different purposes\r\n  served by Articles 3 and 5, the single-word amendment to section 301 may be\r\n  easily reconciled with the balance of the ordinance, specifically including\r\n  Article 5 and section 501.Â  See, e.g., Capco of Summerville, Inc. v.\r\n    J.H. Gayle Constr. Co., 368 S.C. 137, 141-42, 628 S.E.2d 38, 41&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (â€œRepeal by implication is disfavored, and is found only when two statutes are\r\n  incapable of any reasonable reconcilement.Â  Moreover, the repugnancy must be\r\n  plain, and if the two provisions can be construed so that both can stand, a court shall so construe\r\nthem.â€ (internal citation omitted)).\r\nIV.\r\nWe\r\n  readily acknowledge this statutory construction dispute was fostered by the\r\n  actions of Newberry County, especially the initial granting of Eagle\r\n  Containerâ€™s permit application.Â  Nevertheless, well established principles of\r\nstatutory construction dictate the result we reach today.\r\nIn sum, the Article 3, section 301, listing of uses permitted\r\n  has no bearing on the proper use classification of an allowed use as a\r\n  â€œpermitted use,â€ a â€œconditional use,â€ or a â€œspecial exception.â€ We hold the\r\n  mere addition of the word â€œlandfillâ€ to the listing in section 301 of uses\r\n  permitted did not alter the use classification of a landfill.Â  Use\r\n  classification is governed by Article 5, and accordingly, a landfill remains a\r\nâ€œspecial exceptionâ€ use in R-2 districts.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  The record on appeal does not contain the â€œSpecial Exception Application filed\r\n  on May 16, 2003.â€Â  It is undisputed that the County revoked the permit approval\r\non the basis that a landfill is a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ in the R-2 District. \r\n[2]Â  When reviewing a fact-based grant of summary\r\n  judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial\r\n  court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Englert, Inc. v. LeafGuard USA, Inc.,\r\n  377 S.C. 129, 659 S.E.2d 496 (2008).Â  Under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, summary judgment\r\n  is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\r\n  and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there\r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  \r\n[3]Â  We, too, view the intent of County Council as\r\n  unambiguous, and when we examine the purpose of Article 3 of the ordinance\r\n  juxtaposed to Article 5, we conclude that Article 3 is not intended to\r\n  distinguish the various classifications of uses allowed.Â  As the court of\r\n  appeals correctly observed, â€œArticle 3 of the Zoning Ordinance establishes\r\n  zoning districts and lists the general purposes for each zoning district. . .\r\n  .Â  Article 5 sets forth the zoning district regulations [and] [s]ection 500\r\n  classifies three types of uses for the zoning districts . . . .â€Â  Eagle\r\n    Container, 366 S.C. at 617, 622 S.E.2d at 736.Â  A review of the various\r\n  districts listed in section 301 reveals a collection of uses without regard to\r\n  classification as permitted, conditional or special exception.Â  The proper use\r\n  classification of allowed uses is the very function of Article 5, specifically\r\n  section 501.Â  Moreover, were we to find an ambiguity as a result of the\r\n  amendment to section 301, the result would not change. It is clear that the County amended the\r\n  ordinance with full knowledge that a landfill was a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ in R-2\r\n  Districts.Â  Prior to the passing of the amended ordinance, the Newberry County Planning/Zoning\r\n  Director explained:\r\n\r\n  This\r\n    has been a source of confusion for some applicants who were interested in\r\n    finding out what was permitted in R-2 and where in particular landfills were\r\n    permitted.&nbsp; We thought it might need to be added as a clarification\r\n    only.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not adding the use to the district; the district\r\n    already has that use as a Special Exception.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nNotably, these\r\n  recorded statements were made at a County Council meeting during a reading of\r\n  the amended ordinance.Â  In any event,\r\n  were we to indulge in the fiction that the amendment to section 301 created a\r\n  conflict within the ordinance, the ordinance itself provides the manifest\r\n  legislative intent for the resolution of any such conflict.Â  Article 4, section\r\n  400, of the ordinance requires â€œthe most restrictive . . . standards shall\r\n  governâ€ in the event of a conflict among provisions.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to Rule 607 (h)(1), SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2008-08-27-01","description":"The Supreme Court has amended Rule 607, SCACR, to provide for a fee schedule for requests to provide transcripts on an expedited basis.","date":"2008-09-02","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPursuant to Article V, &sect;4, of the South Carolina Constitution, Rule 607 (h)(1), SCACR, is amended by adding the following:\r\n\r\n   (J)\tThe following per page costs apply to requests to produce a transcript on an expedited basis:\r\n  \r\n    (i)\tA fee of Four Dollars and Twenty-Five Cents ($4.25) for original transcripts delivered within seven days of the request and Seventy-Five Cents ($.75) for a copy.\r\n    (ii)\tA fee of Five Dollars and Twenty-Five Cents \r\n      ($5.25) for original transcripts delivered overnight and One Dollar ($1.00) for a copy.\r\n    (iii)\tA fee of Six Dollars and Twenty-Five Cents \r\n    ($6.25) for original transcripts delivered on a daily basis and One Dollar ($1.00) for a copy.\r\n  \r\n\r\n      This amendment is effective immediately, and is applicable to all requests received by a court reporter on or after the date of this order. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     s/Jean H.

Greenville County, 325 S.C. 154,\r\n  480 S.E.2d 718 (1997). \r\nAppellants claim Town did not have\r\n  the power to enact the ordinance because the regulation of smoking is preempted\r\n  by State law.Â  After the briefs were filed in this case, we addressed this\r\n  argument in Foothills Brewing Concern, Inc. v. City of Greenville, Â­Â­Â­377\r\n  S.C. 355, 660 S.E.2d 264 (2008), and concluded that State law does not\r\n  expressly preempt the regulation of smoking by a local government.Â  Further, we\r\n  find no implied preemption.Â  See South Carolina State Ports Auth. v.\r\n    Jasper County, 368 S.C. 388, 629 S.E.2d 624 (2006) (under the implied\r\n  preemption doctrine, an ordinance is preempted when the state statutory scheme\r\n  so thoroughly and pervasively covers the subject as to occupy the entire field,\r\n  or when the subject mandates statewide uniformity).Â Â  \r\nAppellants also argue the regulation of indoor\r\n  tobacco smoke is preempted by the federal Occupational Safety and Health\r\n  Administration (OSHA) and our State Occupational Health and Safety laws, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 41-15-10 et seq. (1986 and Supp. 2007).Â  Federal courts have\r\n  declined to find OSHA preempts state law, e.g., Empire State\r\n    Restaurant and Tavern Assoc., v. New York State, 360 F. Supp. 2d 454 (N.D.\r\n  N.Y. 2005), and we conclude there is no federal preemption of local regulation.Â \r\n  Further, we find nothing in our State laws regarding workplace safety\r\n  indicating the legislature intended to preempt the regulation of indoor tobacco\r\n  smoke in the workplace.\r\n2.Â  Penalty\r\nTownâ€™s ordinance imposes a fine of $500 and/or\r\n  thirty days in jail.Â  Appellants contend the ordinance is invalid because it\r\n  criminalizes conduct that is not illegal under State law.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAs we held in Foothills Brewing,\r\n  Article VIII, Â§ 14, of our State Constitution[1] requires uniformity regarding the criminal law of this State and local\r\n  governments may not criminalize conduct that is legal under a statewide\r\n  criminal law.Â  See also Martin v. Condon, 324 S.C. 183, 478\r\n  S.E.2d 272 (1996)).[2]Â \r\n  Here, the State has not preempted the regulation of indoor smoking; a local\r\n  government may therefore criminalize indoor smoking, but only to the extent\r\n  consistent with State law.Â  See City of North Charleston v. Harper,\r\n  306 S.C. 153, 410 S.E.2d 569 (1991) (local governments may not enact ordinances\r\n  that impose greater or lesser penalties than those established by state law).Â  Townâ€™s\r\n  ordinance is invalid in that it imposes a criminal penalty for smoking in\r\n  places where smoking is not illegal under State law.Â  \r\nTown contends, however, that the offending\r\n  provision regarding a thirty-day jail term should be severed pursuant to the ordinanceâ€™s\r\n  severance clause and the remaining fine be construed as a civil penalty.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  The fine imposed under the ordinance is $500.[3] Â A violation of the provisions of the Clean Indoor Air Act restricting indoor\r\n  smoking is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $10 to $25. See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-95-50 (2002).Â  The fine imposed by Townâ€™s ordinance is\r\n  substantially greater than the criminal fines imposed under the Clean Indoor\r\n  Air Act for tobacco smoking offenses and cannot be construed as simply a civil\r\n  fine.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find the penalty provision of the ordinance\r\n  unconstitutional because it conflicts with State criminal law by imposing a\r\n  criminal penalty for conduct that is not illegal under State law.Â  The order of\r\n  the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Article VIII, Â§ 14 reads:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  enacting provisions required or authorized by this article, general law\r\n  provisions applicable to the following matters shall not be set aside . . .Â \r\n  (5) criminal laws and the penalties and sanctions for the transgression\r\n  thereof; . . . .\r\n\r\n[2]In Foothills Brewing, we examined the ordinance\r\n  in question and concluded it did not constitute a criminal law because a\r\n  violation of the ordinance was designated an â€œinfractionâ€ and the only penalty\r\n  imposed was a fine.Â  In this respect, the ordinance in Foothills Brewing is different from the ordinance here which imposes a fine and/or thirty days in\r\n  jail.Â  Foothills Brewing therefore is not dispositive on this issue. \r\n[3] The recent amendment of the ordinance changing the\r\n  penalty is not before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26540","title":"Campbell v.

Campbellâ€™s (Mother) petition to review a\r\n  court of appeals decision setting aside a probate court order appointing two\r\n  examiners to evaluate Motherâ€™s mental competency in a conservatorship\r\n  proceeding brought by her daughter, Respondent Mary Schuyler Campbell\r\n  (Daughter).Â  We affirm the decision of the court of appeals as modified in\r\n  accordance with our interpretation of the statute governing the appointment of\r\n  examiners in conservatorship proceedings. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nDaughter\r\n  petitioned to have herself appointed as conservator of Motherâ€™s assets before\r\n  the probate court for Cherokee County, claiming that (1) Mother was no longer\r\n  mentally capable of caring for herself or her assets due to dementia, and (2)\r\n  Motherâ€™s assets were being reduced due to undue influence over Mother by her\r\n  financial advisor William W. Brown (Brown).[1]Â \r\n  Mother filed an answer denying the need for the appointment of a conservator\r\n  and arguing that if the court determined she needed a conservator, Brown had\r\n  priority to assume the role as her attorney in fact.Â  \r\nIn April 2002, Mother listed\r\n  Dr. John Cathcart and Dr. Preston Edwards to testify at the conservatorship\r\n  proceeding as expert witnesses on her behalf.Â  Drs. Cathcart and Edwards were\r\n  both lifelong personal friends of Mother, and Dr. Edwards had occasionally seen\r\n  Mother for medical reasons over a period of nearly fifty years when Mother\r\n  primarily resided in Gaffney. Shortly after being designated as expert\r\n  witnesses, Mother invited each of the doctors and their wives to dinner while\r\n  she was in Greenville on other matters.Â  Although the doctors were family\r\n  friends of Mother, their respective social outings with her at this time were also\r\n  for purposes of observation and evaluation of Mother as her expert witnesses.Â  The\r\n  record reveals that Motherâ€™s counsel provided Dr. Edwards with a document\r\n  entitled â€œOutline of Testimonyâ€ summarizing what he might be asked at trial as\r\n  an expert witness.Â  The document was also intended to guide Dr. Edwards in his\r\n  conversation with Mother at their dinner together, indicated by the documentâ€™s\r\n  listing of â€œdiscussion of business or financial matters,â€ followed by the\r\nexclamation â€œdonâ€™t ask if none!â€Â  \r\nIn August 2002, the probate\r\n  court ordered the appointment of Drs. Cathcart and Edwards to examine Mother,\r\n  evaluate her mental competency, and render an opinion to the probate court on\r\n  the need for the appointment of a conservator pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-407\r\n  (1987).Â  Mother does not dispute that the probate court conferred with Motherâ€™s\r\n  counsel during the preparation of the order appointing Drs. Cathcart and\r\n  Edwards.Â  On the other hand, Daughter was entirely unaware that the probate\r\n  court was considering an appointment of examiners until Daughterâ€™s counsel\r\n  received a copy of the order from Motherâ€™s counsel postmarked two days after\r\n  the probate court had actually issued the order.Â  Daughter immediately filed a\r\n  motion to reconsider the appointment on the grounds that Drs. Cathcart and\r\n  Edwards were not â€œdisinterested parties.â€Â  The probate court scheduled a\r\nhearing for October.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to the probate courtâ€™s appointment of examiners, however, arrangements had\r\n  already been made for Drs. Cathcart and Edwards to evaluate Mother, and\r\n  therefore, only seven days after the courtâ€™s appointment, a privately chartered\r\n  jet flew Drs. Cathcart and Edwards, accompanied by Brown, to see Mother at her\r\n  current residence in Florida.Â  The doctors each testified that they met with\r\n  Motherâ€™s Florida psychiatrist, visited with Mother and Father during the\r\n  afternoon, and flew back by the same private jet that same evening.Â  Each\r\n  doctor was compensated $2,000.00.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the October hearing, the probate court determined that Â§ 62-5-407 did not\r\n  require the appointed examiners to be disinterested and that the doctors were\r\n  â€œwell know[n] to this Court as outstanding physicians and as qualified to act\r\n  as the Court-appointed examiners in the matter.â€Â  Therefore, the probate court\r\n  denied Daughterâ€™s motion to reconsider the appointment of Drs. Cathcart and\r\n  Edwards.\r\nAt\r\n  the same hearing, Daughter moved for recusal after the probate judge directed unfavorable\r\n  personal comments at Daughterâ€™s counsel.Â  Daughter additionally based her\r\n  motion for recusal on the ex parte communications with Motherâ€™s counsel prior\r\n  to the appointment of mental health examiners.Â  The probate court denied the\r\n  motion and proceeded to a hearing on the merits of Daughterâ€™s petition to\r\n  appoint a conservator.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  only evidence presented as to the merits of Daughterâ€™s petition was the\r\n  testimony of Drs. Cathcart and Edwards.[2]Â Â \r\n  The doctors testified that they did not perform any medical or psychological\r\n  examinations of Mother, however both were confident in their findings that\r\n  Mother was competent to handle her financial affairs based on their personal\r\n  friendship with Mother, their informal dinner with Mother in April 2002,\r\n  communication with Motherâ€™s Florida psychiatrist, and the August 2002 visit\r\n  with Mother in Florida.Â  The probate court therefore dismissed Daughterâ€™s\r\n  petition for appointment of a conservator.\r\nDaughter\r\n  appealed the probate courtâ€™s orders to the circuit court, alleging that the\r\n  probate court erred in (1) appointing examiners that were the product of ex\r\n  parte communications; (2) appointing examiners that were not disinterested\r\n  parties; (3) failing to grant Daughterâ€™s motion for recusal; and (4) finding\r\n  Mother mentally competent.Â  The circuit court set aside the probate courtâ€™s\r\n  order appointing the examiners, finding that Â§ 62-5-407 implicitly required\r\n  court-appointed examiners to be disinterested, and that the probate court therefore\r\n  abused its discretion in naming Drs. Cathcart and Edwards as examiners when\r\n  Mother had previously designated them as expert witnesses on her behalf.Â \r\n  Because of the probate courtâ€™s error in this regard, the circuit court set\r\n  aside the probate courtâ€™s order dismissing Daughterâ€™s petition to appoint a\r\n  conservator.Â  The circuit court also found that the Cherokee County probate judge should have recused himself and therefore transferred the case to\r\n  Spartanburg County Probate Court.\r\nMother\r\n  appealed and the court of appeals affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s ruling setting\r\n  aside the probate courtâ€™s appointment of examiners and order of dismissal.Â  In\r\n    the Matter of Campbell, 367 S.C. 209, 625 S.E.2d 233 (Ct. App. 2006). The\r\n  court did not address the issue of recusal, noting that Mother conceded the\r\n  issue had been rendered moot due to the death of the probate judge during the\r\n  pendency of the appeal.Â  Id. at 212 n.1, 625 S.E.2d at 235 n.1.Â Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted certiorari, and Mother raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    court of appeals err in affirming the circuit courtâ€™s order setting aside the\r\n    probate courtâ€™s orders based upon a determination that S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    62-5-407 implicitly requires that court-appointed physicians be disinterested?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe interpretation of a statute is a\r\n  question of law for the Court.Â  Vaughan v. McLeod Regional Med. Ctr.,\r\n  372 S.C. 505, 509, 642 S.E.2d 744, 746 (2007).Â  An appellate court may decide\r\n  questions of law with no particular deference to the trial court.Â  Dreher v.\r\n    Dreher, 370 S.C. 75, 79, 634 S.E.2d 646, 648 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that the court of appeals erred in interpreting S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  62-5-407 to implicitly require that court-appointed examiners in a\r\n  conservatorship proceeding be disinterested and independent.Â  \r\nThe cardinal\r\n  rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\n  legislature.Â  Dreher, 370 S.C. at 80, 634 S.E.2d at 648.Â  To this end, the\r\n  words of the statute must be given their&nbsp;plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle\r\n  or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846\r\n  (1992).Â  If the language of a statute is unambiguous, then the rules of statutory construction are unnecessary and the\r\n  court may not impose another meaning.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79,\r\n  85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  \r\nSection\r\n  62-5-407(b) provides that upon receipt of a petition for appointment of a\r\n  conservator due to alleged mental deficiency, â€œthe court shall direct that the\r\n  person to be protected be examined by one or more physicians designated by the\r\n  court, preferably physicians who are not connected with any institution in\r\n  which the person is a patient or is detained.â€\r\nInitially,\r\n  we find that the circuit court and the court of appeals erred in interpreting Â§\r\n  62-5-407 to implicitly require that the court-appointed examiner be\r\n  disinterested.Â  In drafting the provisions governing conservatorship\r\n  proceedings, the legislature undoubtedly sought to establish a framework within\r\n  which the probate court could exercise its discretion with the best interests\r\n  of the allegedly incapacitated person in mind.Â  It would be inconsistent with\r\n  the subjective theory of â€œbest interestsâ€ for the Court to find an overriding\r\n  requirement that all examiners appointed under Â§ 62-5-407 be completely disinterested\r\n  parties.Â  In fact, in certain instances of alleged mental incapacity, it may\r\n  actually be preferable to seek the opinion of a treating physician who is\r\n  familiar with the patient.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  is not to say, however, that the court of appealsâ€™ analysis entirely misses the\r\n  point.Â  Rather, the primary flaw in the opinion below is that it fails to\r\n  distinguish between a â€œdisinterestedâ€ party and an â€œunbiasedâ€ party.Â  Although\r\n  the statute does not impose a per se requirement of disinterestedness, basic\r\n  tenets of justice in our jurisprudence dictate that the appointed examiners\r\n  must be able to render an objective opinion.Â Â  As the court of appeals rightly\r\n  acknowledged, the obvious purpose of the statute permitting the appointment of\r\n  examiners â€œis to provide the probate court with a medical opinion regarding the\r\n  personâ€™s mental capacity, and it is inherent that such an opinion come from a\r\n  neutral physician.â€Â  Campbell, 367 S.C. at 213, 625 S.E.2d at 236.Â  The\r\n  statuteâ€™s â€œpreferenceâ€ for the examiner to be unaffiliated with any institution\r\n  in which the examinee is a patient lends support to the notion that the\r\n  legislature intended for the appointed examiner to be unbiased, for presumably,\r\n  only an unbiased examiner can render an opinion to the probate court that\r\n  considers the best interests of the allegedly incompetent party.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  although the court of appeals erred in interpreting an overriding requirement\r\n  of disinterestedness into Â§ 62-5-407, we hold that the probate court is\r\n  nevertheless obligated to appoint neutral and objective examiners and that\r\n  failure to do so amounts to an abuse of discretion subject to reversal on\r\n  appeal.[3]Â  \r\nTo\r\n  this end, we hold that the court of appeals was correct in affirming the\r\n  setting aside of the probate courtâ€™s appointment of Drs. Cathcart and Edwards.Â \r\n  Mother had previously designated the doctors as expert witnesses and it is\r\n  evident in the record that Motherâ€™s counsel had coached them as such prior to\r\n  their evaluative meetings with Mother.Â  Mother also compensated the doctors for\r\n  the work they performed as her expert witnesses.Â  In our view, these\r\n  circumstances illustrate the fundamental incompatibility in assuming a dual\r\n  role as an expert witness for a party to the litigation and as a neutral\r\n  examiner for the court.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  hold that the probate court committed an abuse of discretion in appointing Drs.\r\n  Cathcart and Edwards as examiners in the conservatorship proceeding.\r\nAdditionally, although Mother\r\n  does not raise to this Court the issue of whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  recusing the probate judge, we briefly address the circuit courtâ€™s ruling on\r\n  the matter because we disagree with the court of appealsâ€™ apparent finding that\r\n  the death of the probate judge during the pendency of the appeal rendered the\r\nissue moot. \r\nIn our view, the circuit\r\n  court properly ordered the recusal of the probate judge.Â  In addition to the\r\n  preparation of an order of appointment that we find was strongly influenced by\r\n  ex parte contact, the probate judge expressed his own favorable opinions on Motherâ€™s\r\n  counsel and the appointed examiners in open court, while directing disparaging\r\n  personal remarks at Daughterâ€™s counsel.Â  These incidents, in our view, are\r\n  manifestations of a clear bias on the part of the probate judge, and therefore,\r\n  we hold that the circuit judge properly ordered the recusal of the probate\r\n  judge and the transfer of the case from Cherokee County Probate Court to\r\nSpartanburg County Probate Court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm as modified the court of appealsâ€™ decision setting\r\n  aside the probate courtâ€™s order appointing Drs. Cathcart and Edwards as\r\n  examiners in a conservatorship proceeding.Â  Accordingly, we remand the case to\r\n  the Spartanburg County Probate Court for further proceedings consistent with this\r\n  opinion.\r\nMOORE, WALLER,\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Letitia H. Verdin, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Daughter brought the conservatorship proceeding with respect to both her\r\n  parents, however, the probate courtâ€™s appointment of examiners at issue in this\r\n  case only pertains to Mother.Â  Incidentally, Father passed away during the\r\npendency of this appeal.\r\n[2] Counsel for Daughter explained to the probate court that he was not prepared to\r\n  proceed with a hearing on the merits because the notice of hearing had given\r\n  him the impression that the court would only be hearing Daughterâ€™s motion to\r\nreconsider the appointment of Motherâ€™s examiners.\r\n[3] See Parkman v. Hanna, 311 S.C. 20, 22, 426\r\n  S.E.2d 743, 744 (1992) (â€œThe authority of the Probate Court, derived from the\r\n  statute and precedent case law, will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.â€).

App. 2006).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n In 1973, Wife\r\n  married Husband #1.Â  They never lived together, but never divorced.Â  In 1985,\r\n  Wife and Husband #2 participated in a marriage ceremony.Â  In 2002, Wife filed\r\n  an action seeking separate support and maintenance and ancillary relief from\r\n  Husband #2.Â  During the course of discovery, Husband #2 learned Wife had never\r\n  been divorced from Husband #1, although she had filed but never served a\r\n  complaint in 1973.Â  In 2003, Husband #2 filed an action seeking to declare\r\n  their marriage void as bigamous.Â  After that action was filed, Wife filed a\r\n  separate suit seeking an annulment of her marriage to Husband #1.Â  This case\r\nwas expedited[1] and an order granting an annulment filed October 31, 2003.Â  \r\nWife then filed a\r\n  motion to dismiss Husband #2â€™s bigamy action based on the October 31, 2003,\r\n  order granting her an annulment and declaring her first marriage void ab\r\n    initio.Â  The family court held Wife was â€œbarred from defending against\r\n  [Husband #2â€™s] action to void the parties [sic] marriage on the basis of the\r\n  Order of Annulmentâ€¦,â€Â  Â Â Wife appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the family\r\n          courtâ€™s decision that Wife could not assert her annulment to defeat Husband\r\n          #2â€™s bigamy claim?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Court of Appeals\r\n  majority affirmed the family court, relying primarily on S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-1-80 (Supp. 2007), titled â€œBigamous marriage shall be void: exceptionsâ€:\r\n\r\n  All\r\n    marriages contracted while either of the parties has a former wife or husband\r\n    living shall be void.Â  But this section shall not extend to a person whose husband\r\n    or wife shall be absent for the space of five years, the one not knowing the\r\n    other to be living during that time, not [sic] to any person who shall be\r\n    divorced or whose first marriage shall be declared void by the sentence of a\r\n    competent court.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of\r\n  Appeals that this statute is dispositive of Wifeâ€™s claim.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the statute, since Wifeâ€™s Husband #1 was still living in 1985, her purported\r\n  marriage to Husband #2 was void unless one of the three statutory exceptions is\r\n  met.Â  The first exception, the five year abandonment clause is not implicated\r\n  here, nor is the second, since Wife was not divorced from Husband #1.Â  Wife\r\n  relies upon the third exception, which excepts from the bigamy definition an\r\n  individual â€œwhose first marriage shall be declared void by the sentence of a\r\n  competent court.â€\r\nThe question is\r\n  whether the October 2003 annulment order declaring Wifeâ€™s first marriage void ab\r\n    initio relates back so as to validate her purported 1985 marriage.Â  In\r\n  construing a statute, we need not resort to rules of construction where the\r\n  statuteâ€™s language is plain.Â  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361,\r\n  585 S.E.2d 292 (2003).Â  Under the statuteâ€™s terms, Wifeâ€™s â€œmarriageâ€ to Husband\r\n  #2 was â€œvoidâ€ from the inception since at the time of that marriage she had a\r\n  living spouse and that marriage had not been â€œdeclared void.â€Â  Â§ 20-1-80.\r\nWhile\r\n  an annulment order relates back in most senses, it does not have the ability to\r\n  validate the bigamous second â€œmarriage.â€Â  Since there was no marriage under the\r\n  plain terms of the statute when the ceremony between Wife and Husband #2 was\r\n  performed in 1985, there was nothing to be â€œrevivedâ€ by the annulment order in\r\n  2003.Â  See e.g., Day v. Day, 216 S.C. 334, 58 S.E.2d 83\r\n  (1950) (â€œA mere marriage ceremony between a man and a woman, where one of them\r\n  has a living wife or husband, is not a marriage at all.Â  Such a marriage is\r\n  absolutely void, and not merely voidableâ€) [2]; Howell v. Littlefield, 211 S.C. 462, 46 S.E.2d 47 (1947) (â€œ[Husbandâ€™s]\r\n  existing marriageâ€¦incapacitated himâ€¦to contract another marriageâ€¦.â€).Â  The\r\n  statute speaks to the status quo at the time the marriage was contracted, and\r\n  does not contemplate either a prospective or a retroactive perspective.Â  Any\r\n  other construction of Â§ 20-1-80 would lead to uncertainty and chaos.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  under South Carolinaâ€™s current view of bigamy, the family court has\r\n  jurisdiction to decide all ancillary matters where it annuls a marriage and\r\n  declares it void ab initio.Â  Rodman v. Rodman, 361 S.C. 291, 604\r\n  S.E.2d 399 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  It would be inconsistent at best to hold that a\r\n  marriage declared void ab initio never existed for bigamy purposes, yet\r\n  can serve as the foundation for a family courtâ€™s division of property, alimony,\r\n  and/or child support.Â  The Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the family court\r\n  ruling on this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice Georgia V. Anderson, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The complaint was filed October 21, 2003, the hearing was held October 31,\r\n2003, and the order annulling that marriage signed the same day as the hearing.\r\n[2] Wife would distinguish Day since it involves the first exception to the\r\n  bigamy statute rather than the third.Â  What is important about Day is not\r\n  the exception, but rather the rule: the bigamous marriage is not a marriage at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26542","title":"Wogan v.

Kunze, 366 S.C. 583, 623 S.E.2d 107 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  We affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Dr. Kunze, as\r\n  modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitionerâ€™s husband, James J. Wogan, was diagnosed\r\n  with rectal cancer in 1997 and was treated with chemotherapy by an oncologist,\r\n  Dr. Thomas.Â  Mr. Wogan developed a very severe case of diarrhea, resulting in\r\n  malnutrition and dehydration, for which he was referred to Respondent, Dr.\r\n  Kunze, a gastroenterologist.Â  A colostomy was performed to stop the diarrhea\r\n  but did not remedy the problem.Â  Dr. Kunze placed\r\n  Wogan on the drug Sandostatin SC, which was inserted subcutaneously\r\n  three times a day and was not covered by Medicare.Â  Sandostatin SC stopped the diarrhea within a few days.Â  \r\nA few weeks later, Dr. Kunze suggested Mr. Wogan try a new drug,\r\n  Sandostatin LAR, which could be administered monthly, and was, according to\r\n  Woganâ€™s complaint, covered by Medicare.Â  Dr. Kunze refused to pre-order the\r\n  Sandostatin LAR and administer it in his office because he did not believe it was\r\n  covered by Medicare unless the diarrhea was caused by the chemotherapy.Â  The\r\n  chemotherapist, Dr. Thomas, was of the opinion that it was not covered.Â  Dr.\r\n  Thomas also refused to prescribe and administer the medication. Dr. Kunze ultimately\r\n  agreed to administer the Sandostatin LAR, but he required the Wogans to\r\n  purchase the monthly doses directly from a pharmacy.Â  \r\nThe Wogans purchased Sandostatin LAR at a cost of $2000 per month\r\n  for three months.[1] Â Neither Dr. Kunze nor Dr. Thomas would assist them with filing a Medicare\r\n  claim.Â  Mr. Wogan died in October 2001.\r\nMrs. Wogan filed this action against Dr. Kunze and others,\r\n  alleging (1) negligence based on both medical malpractice from the surgery and\r\n  Dr. Kunzeâ€™s failure to file Medicare claims for the Sandostatin LAR; (2) breach\r\n  of Dr. Kunzeâ€™s contract with Medicare under which it was alleged Mr. Wogan was\r\n  a third-party beneficiary; (3) violations of the South Carolina Unfair Trade\r\n  Practices Act (UTPA); (4) breach of fiduciary duty in failing to file the\r\n  Medicare claim; and (5) loss of consortium.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court granted partial summary judgment to Dr. Kunze, holding Mrs. Wogan\r\n  could not assert a state law negligence claim based on Kunzeâ€™s failure to comply\r\n  with a federal act, where the federal act (Medicare Act) did not allow a\r\n  private right of action.Â  The trial court further rejected Woganâ€™s breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty claim, finding the only breaches alleged (medical malpractice\r\n  and failure to file a claim) had been alleged in the negligence cause of\r\n  action.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.[2]\r\n\r\nISSUES[3]\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Did the Court\r\n    of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Wogan could not\r\n    maintain a state negligence claim against Dr. Kunze based upon his failure to\r\n    file the Medicare claim?\r\n   2.Â  Was summary\r\n    judgment properly granted on the breach of fiduciary duty claim?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the\r\n  grant of summary judgment, this Court applies the same standard which governs\r\n  the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there\r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  In determining whether triable issues of fact exists,\r\n  the evidence and all factual inferences must be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party.Â Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth., 354 S.C.\r\n  397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  If evidentiary facts are not disputed\r\n  but the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them are, summary judgment\r\n  should be denied.Â  Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 415, 401 S.E.2d\r\n  169, 171 (1991).Â  The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of\r\n  cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  George v. Fabri,\r\n  345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001).\r\n1.Â  NEGLIGENCE[4]Â Â Â Â  \r\nWogan contends the Court of Appeals erred\r\n  in affirming the grant of summary judgment to Dr. Kunze.Â  She asserts liability\r\n  is based, not on a violation of the Medicare Act,[5] but upon a violation of the standard\r\n  of care of a reasonable physician.Â  Wogan claims it was a breach of the\r\n  standard of care for Dr. Kunze to refuse to file a Medicare claim on her\r\n  behalf.Â  The trial court and Court of Appeals held that, inasmuch as there is\r\n  no right of action under the Medicare Act, Wogan could not base her state law\r\n  claim on Dr. Kunzeâ€™s failure to file such a claim.Â  We agree with the result\r\n  reached in this case; however, we find the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding overly\r\n  broad.\r\nContrary to the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling, there are some circumstances\r\n  in which a state law negligence claim may be maintained against a third party\r\n  as a result of the denial of Medicare benefits.Â  The United States Supreme\r\n  Court addressed this issue peripherally in Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 615 (1984).Â  Heckler involved a suit brought by three people who were\r\n  denied reimbursement for bilateral carotid body resection (BCBR) surgery and\r\n  one person who declined the surgery because he was unable to pay for it.Â  They\r\n  brought an action challenging the Secretary of Health and Human Servicesâ€™\r\n  ruling that the surgery was neither reasonable nor necessary.Â  Although the\r\n  case involved the issue of whether the plaintiffs could maintain suit in\r\n  federal court, or were first required to exhaust their administrative remedies\r\n  via review pursuant to 42 USC Â§ 405 (g) of the Medicare Act, the Supreme Court\r\n  held â€œ[I]t seems to us that it makes no sense to construe the claims of those\r\n  three respondents as anything more than, at bottom, a claim that they should be\r\n  paid for their BCBR surgery.â€Â  466 U.S. at 614.Â Â  Accordingly, the Court held\r\n  that because the plaintiffsâ€™ claims were â€œinextricably intertwinedâ€ with their\r\n  claim for benefits, that they were required to proceed under the Medicare\r\n  Act.Â Â  The Court recognized that there may be an exception in certain special\r\n  cases where claims are â€œwholly collateralâ€ to a claim for benefits under the\r\n  Act, or where there is a colorable claim that an erroneous â€œdenial of\r\n    benefits in the early stages of the administrative process will injure them in\r\n    a way that cannot be remedied by the later payment of benefits.â€Â  466 U.S. at 618 (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\nAn example of such an exception was demonstrated in Ardary v.\r\n  Aetna Health Plans of California, Inc. 98 F.3d 496 (9th Cir. 1996), cert.\r\n    denied 520 U.S. 1251 (1997).Â  There, the decedent suffered a heart attack\r\n  and was taken to a small, rural hospital near her home, which had neither\r\n  intensive care nor cardiac facilities.Â  The decedentâ€™s husband requested she be\r\n  air-lifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center, a larger and better\r\n  equipped facility, but the request was denied, and Mrs. Ardary died.Â  Ardary\r\n  filed a wrongful death suit alleging Mrs. Ardary died because of the failure to\r\n  authorize an airlift to Loma Linda.Â  The Ninth Circuit held the plaintiffsâ€™\r\n  claims were state common law claims, which were not â€œinextricably intertwinedâ€\r\n  with the denial of benefits.Â  Ardary, 498 F.3d at 500.Â  The court found\r\n  that, â€œ[a]lthough the Ardarys . . . wrongful death complaint is predicated on\r\n  Arrowestâ€™s failure to authorize the airlift transfer, the claims are not\r\n  â€˜inextricably intertwinedâ€™ because the Ardarys are at bottom not seeking to\r\n    recover benefits.â€Â  Id. (emphasis supplied).Â  But see Biometric\r\n      Health Services v. Aetna, 903 F.2d 480 7th Cir. (1990) (party\r\n  cannot avoid Medicare Actâ€™s jurisdictional bar simply by styling its attack as\r\n  a claim for collateral damages instead of a challenge to the underlying denial\r\n  of benefits; if litigants may routinely obtain judicial review of these\r\n  decisions by recharacterizing their claims under state causes of action, the\r\n  Medicare Actâ€™s goal of limited judicial review for a substantial number of\r\n  claims would be severely undermined).\r\nHeckler has been interpreted as â€œsweeping within the administrative review process only\r\n  those claims that, at bottom, seek reimbursement or payment for medical services.â€\r\n  Â McCall v. PacificCare of Cal., 21 P.3d 1189, 1199 (Calif.), cert\r\n    denied 535 U.S. 951 (2001) See also Regional Medical Transport\r\n      Inc. v. Highmark Inc., ___ F.Supp2d___, 2008 WL 872255 (E.D. Pa. 2008) (in\r\n  assessing whether a claim falls into this category, courts must discount any\r\n  â€œcreative pleadingâ€ which may transform Medicare disputes into mere state law\r\n  claims, and painstakingly determine whether such claims are ultimately Medicare\r\n  disputes).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  contrary to the Court of Appealsâ€™â€™ opinion, whether a state common law action\r\n  for negligence may be maintained depends, under Heckler and subsequent\r\n  cases, on whether or not the plaintiffâ€™s claims are, at bottom, a claim seeking\r\n  payment of reimbursement of sums which are alleged to be covered by Medicare,\r\n  or whether the claims are wholly independent, but nonetheless stemming from the\r\n  failure to provide some type of Medicare service.Â  To the extent the Court of\r\n  Appealsâ€™ opinion fails to acknowledge the possibility of a state law claim, it\r\n  is hereby modified. \r\nHowever, we concur with the result reached by the Court of\r\n  Appeals.Â  Although Wogan characterizes her cause of action as a state law claim\r\n  for negligence, it is, at bottom, a claim for reimbursement of the $2000 per\r\n  month which was expended on Sandostatin LAR prior to Mr. Woganâ€™s death.Â  Her\r\n  claim is therefore â€œinextricably intertwinedâ€ with the refusal to file a\r\n  Medicare claim and is therefore not cognizable on state law negligence grounds.[6]Â  The grant of summary judgment to Dr.\r\n  Kunze is affirmed.Â  \r\n2.Â  BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY\r\nWogan also asserts the trial court erred\r\n  in granting summary judgment on her claim for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  Once\r\n  again, the underlying basis of the breach of fiduciary duty claim is that Wogan\r\n  seeks reimbursement of the expenses she suffered by having to pay for the\r\n  Sandostatin LAR for three months out-of-pocket.Â Â  Pursuant to Heckler and Ardary, we find Woganâ€™s claim is at bottom an attempt to\r\n  recover monies which would otherwise have been paid by Medicare.Â  Since such a\r\n  claim is not cognizable as an independent state negligence claim, it was\r\n  properly dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  The Wogans paid approximately $1,278 a month for Sandostatin SC; they paid\r\n  approximately $2,094 a month for Sandostatin LAR.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The claims for violation of the UTPA and breach\r\n  of third party beneficiary contract were also dismissed, as were the claims\r\nagainst Dr. Thomas.Â  No issue is raised on certiorari regarding these claims.Â  \r\n[3]Â  In light of our holding, we need not address\r\nWoganâ€™s remaining issue.Â  \r\n[4]Â  The underlying medical malpractice claims remain\r\npending against Dr. Kunze.Â  \r\n[5]Â \r\n  Wogan does not contest the fact that case law generally holds there is no\r\n  private right or action under the Medicare Act.Â  See Brogdon v. Natâ€™l\r\n    Healthcare Corp., 103 F.Supp.2d 1322, 1340 (N.D.Ga.2000) (Congress did not\r\n  intend to create a private right of action when it enacted the Medicare and\r\n  Medicaid Acts and authorized their accompanying regulations); Abner v.\r\n    Mobile Infirmary Hospital, 149 Fed. Appx. 857 (11th Cir. 2005) (noting that\r\n  Medicare Act does not create a private right of action for negligence); Ratmansky\r\n    ex rel. Ratmansky v. Plymouth House Nursing Home, Inc., 2005 WL 770628\r\n  (E.D.Pa. 2005) (Medicare Act and regulations do not create a private right of\r\n  action against nursing home).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[6]Â  We agree with Woganâ€™s contention that the\r\n  violation of a statute or regulation may, in a proper case, be used as evidence\r\n  of negligence.Â  See e.g., Wise v. Broadway, 315 S.C. 273, 433 S.e.2d\r\n  857 (1993); Daniels v. Bernard, 270 S.C. 51, 240 S.E.2d 518 (1978); Shearer\r\n    v. DeShon, 240 S.C. 472, 126 S.E.2d 514 (1962) (causative violation of a\r\n  statute constitutes negligence per se).Â  Violation of a Medicare statute could\r\n  conceivably be used to support of a state negligence claim where the state law\r\n  claim is not inextricably intertwined with a claim for Medicare reimbursement.Â \r\n  For example, in Ardary, the plaintiffs would be entitled to demonstrate\r\n  that the defendantâ€™s failure to authorize an airlift to the regional hospital\r\n  violated a Medicare statute or regulation, thereby causing Mrs. Ardaryâ€™s\r\nuntimely death. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26544","title":"Collins Holding Corporation v.

Carolina Rental Ctr., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Duty to Defend\r\n Insurance Company\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in ruling that it had a duty to defend\r\n  Collins in the underlying lawsuit because the Plaintiffsâ€™ complaint did not\r\n  allege an â€œoccurrence.â€Â  We agree.\r\nIn an action for a declaratory judgment, the obligation of a liability\r\n  insurance company to defend and indemnify is determined by the allegations in\r\n  the complaint.Â  Mfrs. and Merchants Mut. Ins. Co. v. Harvey, 330\r\n  S.C. 152, 162, 498 S.E.2d 222, 227 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (citing R.A. Earnhardt Textile Mach. Div. Inc. v. S.C. Ins.\r\n    Co., 277 S.C. 88, 282 S.E.2d 856 (1981)).Â  If the facts alleged in the\r\n  complaint fail to bring a claim within the policyâ€™s coverage, the insurer has\r\n  no duty to defend.Â  S.C. Med.\r\n    Malpractice Liab. Ins. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n v. Ferry, 291 S.C. 460, 463, 354 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1987).Â  In examining the complaint, a\r\n  court must look beyond the labels describing the acts to the acts themselves\r\n  which form the basis of the claim against the insurer. Prior v. S.C. Med. Malpractice Liab. Ins. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 305\r\n  S.C. 247, 249, 407 S.E.2d 655, 657 (Ct. App. 1991) (citing Ferry, 291 S.C. at 462, 354 S.E.2d at 379-80).Â  \r\nWe hold that\r\n  Insurance Company did not breach its duty to defend Collins against the\r\n  underlying lawsuit because the Plaintiffsâ€™ complaint did not allege the\r\n  possibility of an â€œoccurrenceâ€ as defined in the policy.Â  The facts of the\r\n  complaint asserted that Collins systematically violated South Carolina laws\r\n  specifically enacted to protect the public from excessive gambling losses.Â  For\r\n  example, the Plaintiffs asserted Collins exceeded the maximum daily payout\r\n  limit of $125 and engaged in advertising schemes which fraudulently induced the\r\n  Plaintiffs to believe that they could win â€œjackpotsâ€ in excess of the $125\r\n  limit.Â  Additionally,Â  the Plaintiffs employed words and phrases such as:\r\n  â€œunlawfully and fraudulently seek to induce and entice;â€ â€œengaged in\r\n  advertising about and offering inducements . . . that are clearly and expressly\r\n  prohibited by South Carolina law;â€ â€œracketeering activity;â€ â€œconspiring;â€\r\n  â€œknowingly engaging;â€ and â€œknowingly conducting.â€Â  These allegations constitute\r\n  intentional, deliberate, and illegal acts executed with the purpose of addicting\r\n  patrons to gambling machines, and in our view, such alleged conduct cannot be\r\n  construed as accidental in nature.Â  See Green v. U. Ins. Co. of Am., 254 S.C. 202, 205, 174 S.E.2d 400, 402 (1970)\r\n  (defining accident as an unexpected happening or event, which\r\n  occurs by chance and usually suddenly, with harmful result, not intended or\r\n  designed by the person suffering the harm or hurt).Â  Therefore, we\r\n  hold that there is no possibility of coverage under the policy and that\r\n  Insurance Company did not violate its duty to defend.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  further hold that the trial court erred in basing its finding of the\r\n  possibility of coverage on the negligent misrepresentation cause of action.Â  In Manufacturer and Merchants Mutual Insurance Company v.\r\n    Harvey, 330 S.C. 152, 498 S.E.2d 222 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1998), the parents of children whom Norman Harvey sexually abused filed\r\n  suit against Harvey and his wife alleging, among other things, negligent\r\n  supervision.Â  The court of appeals looked beyond the mere label of\r\n  â€œnegligence,â€ and determined that the underlying facts of the\r\n  complaint did not support a cause of action for negligent conduct.Â \r\n  Specifically, the court found that the facts alleged that Harvey committed\r\n  intentional acts and then incorporated the acts into the negligence cause of\r\n  action.Â  Accordingly, the court held that Harveyâ€™s\r\n  insurance company did not have a duty to defend.\r\nIn our\r\n  view, this case presents a similar situation.Â  The Plaintiffs alleged eight\r\n  causes of action including Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\r\n  (RICO) Act violations, fraud and deceit, South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices\r\n  Act violations, and civil conspiracy.Â  While the complaint does state a cause\r\n  of action for negligent misrepresentation, we must look beyond the label of\r\n  negligence to determine if Insurance Company had a duty to defend Collins. See id. at 163, 498 S.E.2d at 228\r\n  (holding that where a complaint mischaracterizes intentional\r\n  conduct as negligent conduct, a court may find no duty to defend despite the\r\n  label of negligence in the complaint).Â  Â Â To support their negligent\r\n  misrepresentation claim, the Plaintiffs incorporated the previous facts and\r\n  alleged Collins sold, leased, and distributed machines that were equipped in a\r\n  manner â€œas to permit manipulationâ€ and that were configured to be used in a\r\n  manner that violated laws expressly designed to protect the public from the\r\n  lure of excessive gambling.Â  In our view, these allegations do\r\n  not support a claim for negligent conduct.Â  Compare Isle of Palms Pest Control Co. v. Monticello Ins. Co., 319\r\n  S.C. 12, 15, 459 S.E.2d 318, 319 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994) (finding a duty to defend where the complaint alleged a negligent termite\r\n  inspection caused property damage).Â  Therefore, because the\r\n  negligent misrepresentation claim incorporates the same facts and does not\r\n  allege an â€œoccurrence,â€ we hold that this cause of action did not trigger Insurance\r\n  Companyâ€™s duty to defend.Â  \r\nII. Waiver\r\nInsurance Company argues that the trial\r\n  court erred in ruling that it waived any defense based on Collinsâ€™s untimely\r\n  notice of the underlying lawsuit.Â  In light of our holding regarding the duty\r\n  to defend, this issue is moot, and we therefore decline to address the merits\r\n  of this issue.Â  See Seabrook v. Knox, 369\r\n  S.C. 191, 197, 631 S.E.2d 907, 910 (2006)\r\n  (recognizing that this Court will not decide moot\r\n  questions in which a judgment rendered will have no practical legal effect).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s order\r\n  granting summary judgment, and hold that Insurance Company had no duty to\r\n  defend Collins in the underlying lawsuit.Â  \r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  As the majority holds,\r\n  when considering whether an insurance company has the duty to defend, the court\r\n  must look beyond the adjectives and labels used in the complaint to describe\r\n  the acts to the acts themselves.Â  Prior v. S.C. Med. Malpractice Liab. Ins.\r\n    Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 305 S.C. 247, 407 S.E.2d 655 (Ct. App. 1997).Â \r\n  Here, the circuit court judge looked beyond the labels and determined that the\r\n  negligent misrepresentation claim gave rise to a duty to defend because he\r\n  found the â€œfraudulent unlawful promotionâ€ which suggested players could win\r\n  more than the daily maximum allowable by law and offered special inducements to\r\n  gamblers, might also be characterized as â€œunintentionally unlawful.â€Â  I find\r\n  the trial judge correctly held that the Plaintiffs alleged a negligent\r\n  misrepresentation claim based on intentional acts that may have inadvertently\r\n  violated the law.Â  Unlike the â€œinherently injuriousâ€ conduct in Mfr. and\r\n    Merchants Mut. Ins. Co. v. Harvey, 330 S.C. 152, 498 S.E.2d 222 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998), the allegations that Collins advertised, offered food and beverages, and\r\n  extended credit to Plaintiffs to promote participation in a then legal activity\r\n  do not allege conduct that is in all particulars illegal.\r\nThe\r\n  facts alleged in the third amended complaint[2] support the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion that the complaint alleges an occurrence\r\n  within the meaning of this CGL policy. E.g., Isle of Palms Pest Control v. Monticello Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 12, 459 S.E.2d 318 (Ct. App. 1995).Â \r\n  Moreover, I would hold that the trial court correctly held appellant waived any\r\n  right to rely on the alleged untimeliness of respondentâ€™s notice when it failed\r\n  to plead it.Â  While an issue not raised by the pleadings may be tried by\r\n  consent at a summary judgment hearing, Staubes v. City of Folly Beach,\r\n  339 S.C. 406, 529 S.E.2d 543 (2000), such was not the case here. \r\nI\r\n  recognize that based solely on the assertions in the Plaintiffsâ€™ third amended complaint,\r\n  it is unlikely that Collins, as owner/lessor of the machines, could ultimately\r\n  be liable for negligent misrepresentation.Â  However, when determining whether\r\n  an insurer has a duty to defend, the obligation is determined by the\r\n  allegations in the complaint.Â  Harvey, 330 S.C. at 162, 498 S.E.2d at\r\n  222.Â  Accordingly, I would affirm the trial courtâ€™s order granting Collins\r\nsummary judgment. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The suit was removed to federal court and the district court initially granted\r\n  an injunction and partial summary judgment against Collins and the other\r\n  defendants.Â  The Fourth Circuit held that the district court should have\r\n  abstained based on the authority of Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319\r\n  U.S. 315 (1943), and the court therefore vacated and remanded the case to the\r\n  district court.Â  Johnson v. Collins Entmâ€™t Co., Inc., 199 F.3d 710 (4th\r\n  Cir. 1999).Â  The district court then certified the state law questions, which\r\n  this Court answered.Â  Johnson v. Collins Entmâ€™t Co., Inc., 349 S.C. 613,\r\n  564 S.E.2d 653 (2002).Â  The parties settled the suit following this Courtâ€™s\r\nopinion.Â  \r\n[2] Although the Plaintiffs incorporate their previously stated facts and\r\n  allegations into their negligent misrepresentation cause of action, they also\r\n  include six paragraphs of additional facts and allegations that specifically\r\npertain to negligent misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26545","title":"Smith v.

Fox, various Charleston County offices, and the\r\n  Department of Revenue appeal the master-in-equityâ€™s finding that a person buying a property in a county\r\n  delinquent property tax sale purchased the property subject to outstanding Internal\r\n  Revenue Service (IRS) liens.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nGeorge\r\n  C. Moultrie, d/b/a George Moultrie &amp; Associates, owned property on Rivers Avenue in Charleston County.Â  Moultrie failed to pay federal income taxes, and the\r\n  IRS filed a notice of a tax lien on his property in the amount of $89,789.10 on\r\n  September 2, 1997, in the R.M.C. office for Charleston County.Â  Moultrie died in 2001, and the IRS filed its claim with the probate court for Charleston County on July 2, 2002.Â  Moultrieâ€™s state ad valorem taxes on the property for\r\n  the tax year 2001 were not paid.Â  Charleston County issued a tax execution for\r\n  the 2001 taxes and directed the Charleston County Sheriff to levy by distress\r\n  and sell the property at a non-judicial tax sale to satisfy the delinquent property\r\n  taxes.Â  Charleston County followed the statutory notice provisions and properly\r\n  conducted a tax sale of the property on December 2, 2002.Â  Steven Fox was the\r\n  successful bidder and paid $14,000 for the property.Â  It is undisputed that the\r\n  IRS was not given notice of the tax sale.Â  Neither Moultrieâ€™s estate nor the\r\n  IRS attempted to redeem the property before the end of the statutory redemption\r\n  period on December 2, 2003. \r\nFox was\r\n  given a deed to the property on March 31, 2004.Â  He initiated a declaratory\r\n  judgment action on June 8, 2005, seeking to quiet title pursuant to the\r\n  two-year statute of limitations.Â  The named parties included Moultrieâ€™s estate,\r\n  various Charleston County offices (collectively, the â€œCountyâ€), including the\r\n  treasurer and tax collector, the United States Government acting through the\r\n  IRS, the South Carolina Department of Revenue, and any other unknown heirs.Â \r\n  The parties consented to having the case referred to a master-in-equity.Â  \r\nAlthough the County, the Department of Revenue, and the estate did\r\n  not contest the tax sale, the IRS appeared at the February 15, 2006 hearing to\r\n  contest the sale.Â  The IRS argued that because they were not given notice of\r\n  the tax sale pursuant to federal law and there was no application to discharge\r\n  the tax lien, Fox purchased the property subject to the federal tax lien.Â  At\r\n  the time of the hearing on the declaratory judgment action, the parties\r\n  estimated the outstanding federal lien, plus interest, had grown to $145,000.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  hearing arguments from the parties and reviewing their submitted briefs, the\r\n  master-in-equity ruled the property was purchased subject to the IRS tax lien.Â \r\n  The master noted that while the County followed all the state statutory\r\n  notice procedures for performing a tax sale and the state statute did not\r\n  require notice to be given to the federal government, federal law holds that\r\n  federal tax liens survive a sale of the property where the federal government\r\n  is not given notice of the sale.Â  Fox, the County, and the Department of\r\n  Revenue (collectively, â€œAppellantsâ€), all appealed, and this Court granted the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ motion to certify the case.Â  \r\nSCOPE OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  action to quiet title is one in equity.Â  Van Every v. Chinquapin Hollow,\r\n    Inc., 265 S.C. 474, 477, 219 S.E.2d 909, 910 (1975).Â  In an action in\r\n  equity, tried with reference to a master, this Court reviews the evidence and\r\n  determines the facts according to its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence, though it is not required to disregard the findings of the master.Â  Friarsgate,\r\n    Inc. v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, 317 S.C. 452, 456, 454 S.E.2d\r\n  901, 904 (Ct. App. 1995).Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellants\r\n  all argue the master erred in interpreting federal law by holding it merely subordinated\r\n  the federal lien.Â  They argue the master erred by not recognizing the law\r\n  provides that the federal lien is not valid when there is a local property tax\r\n  lien on the property which is entitled to priority.Â  Thus, they assert, since\r\n  the lien was not valid, the failure to follow the federal notice provisions did\r\n  not make the federal lien survive the sale. \r\nIn\r\n  interpreting these statutes, we must look to the plain meaning.Â  â€œIf the statute is clear and\r\n  unambiguous â€˜that is the end of the matter, for the court, as well as the\r\n  agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.â€™ . .\r\n  . The traditional deference courts pay to agency interpretation is not to be\r\n  applied to alter the clearly expressed intent of Congress.â€Â  Bd. of\r\n    Governors, FRS v. Dimension Fin. Corp., 474 U.S. 361, 368 (1986) (quoting Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.\r\n      Natural Res. Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984)); New\r\n        York Times Co. v. Spartanburg County Sch. Dist. No. 7, 374 S.C. 307, 310,\r\n  649 S.E.2d 28, 29-30 (2007) (â€œWe cannot construe a statute without regard to\r\n  its plain and ordinary meaning, and this Court may not resort to subtle or\r\n  forced construction in an attempt to limit or expand a statuteâ€™s scope.â€).Â  In\r\n  determining the plain meaning of a statute, the courts must look at the\r\n  particular statutory language at issue and the language and design of the\r\n  statute as a whole.Â  Bethesda Hosp. Assâ€™n v. Bowen, 485 U.S. 399,\r\n  403-05 (1988); Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581\r\n  (2000)(â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a\r\n  clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not\r\n  needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€).\r\nA\r\n  county property tax becomes a first lien on real property and attaches at the\r\n  beginning of the fiscal year in which the tax is levied.Â  Taylor v.\r\n    Mill, 310 S.C. 526, 528, 426 S.E.2d 311, 312 (1992); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-49-10 (2000).Â  While there are strict statutory requirements for a valid tax\r\n  sale, the parties do not dispute that the County properly followed those\r\n  requirements and notified the delinquent taxpayer and any mortgagees of the tax\r\n  sale.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-140 (2000) (adopting notice\r\n  requirements to mortgagees from section 12-49-220 to apply to non-judicial sales);\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 (2000) (providing procedure for a levy of execution\r\n  on delinquent taxpayerâ€™s property and notice to delinquent taxpayer); S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-49-220 (2000) (providing that notice must be given to mortgagees\r\n  twenty days before a tax sale).Â  Nothing in the state statutes required the County\r\n  to notify the IRS of the tax sales.Â  Thus, the key question is whether the\r\n  federal tax laws hold that the federal tax lien survives the state tax sale\r\n  where no notice of the sale was given. \r\nWhen a\r\n  person fails to pay a federal tax liability, the amount due becomes a â€œlien in\r\n  favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether\r\n  real or personal, belonging to such person.â€Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 6321 (2002).Â  This\r\n  lien continues until the lien is satisfied or becomes unenforceable after a\r\n  lapse of time.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 6322 (2002).Â  â€œThe overriding purpose of the tax\r\n  lien statute obviously is to ensure prompt revenue collectionâ€ because the\r\n  â€œcollection of taxes is vital to the functioning, indeed existence,â€ of the\r\n  government.Â  United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 734-35 (1979).Â  Thus, the property â€œshall, except as otherwise provided, be made\r\n  subject to and without disturbingâ€ the federal lien if the United States\r\n  recorded notice of its lien thirty days before the sale but the United States\r\n  was not given notice[1] of the sale.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 7425 (b)(1) (2002). \r\nHowever, in section 6323, entitled, â€œValidity and priority against\r\n  certain persons,â€ the federal government has provided ten instances where\r\n  federal liens are subordinated in priority against certain persons, even where\r\n  the United States has filed its notice of a lien.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 6323 (2002); see Hinkley &amp; Donovan v. Paine, 424 F.Supp. 1013, 1019 (D.C.N.H. 1977)\r\n  (interpreting section 6323 and stating â€œCongress very specifically provided for various kinds of\r\n  transactions which would have priority even over filed tax liensâ€); United\r\n    States v. Amos, 287 F.Supp. 886, 890-91 (D.C. Ill. 1968) (interpreting section\r\n  6323(b)(6), as modified by the Federal Tax Lien Act, as rendering â€œfederal tax\r\n  liens junior to liens securing local real estate taxes, if such real estate\r\n  taxes are entitled to priority under local lawâ€).Â  For example, an IRS lien â€œshall not be validâ€ against:Â  a\r\n  purchaser of securities without notice of the lien; a purchaser of a motor\r\n  vehicle without notice of the lien; a purchaser of personal property without\r\n  notice of the lien where purchased at a retail establishment; a purchaser of\r\n  personal property without knowledge of the lien where purchased at a casual\r\n  sale for less than $1,000;[2] a holder of a possessory lien on personal property; a holder of a mechanicâ€™s\r\n  lien on residential property for certain repairs and improvements where the\r\n  contract price was less than $5,000;[3] an attorney who holds a lien or contract against a judgment for compensation;\r\n  the organization which is the insurer of a life insurance, endowment, or\r\n  annuity contract before the organization had actual notice of the lien; and an institution\r\n  providing loans with respect to a savings deposit, share, or other account\r\n  where the loan is made without knowledge of the lien.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 6323\r\n  (b)(1)-(5), (7)-(10) (2002).Â  It is the sixth situation that is relied upon in\r\n  this case, and it provides that a federal â€œlien shall not be validâ€:Â  \r\n\r\n\t(b)(6)Â  Real property tax and special assessment liens.--\r\n  With respect to real property, as against a holder of a lien upon such property,\r\n  if such lien is entitled under local law to priority over security interests in\r\n  such property which are prior in time, and such lien secures payment of -\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(A) a tax of general application levied by any taxing authority\r\n  based upon the value of such property;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n26 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n  6323 (b)(6)(A) (2002).Â  \r\nAppellants interpret section 6323(b)(6)(A) to mean that the lien\r\n  on the property became invalid once the County took possession of the\r\n  property to sell at a tax sale.Â  Thus, they argue, because the lien was not\r\n  valid as to the property pursuant to section 6323(b)(6)(A), and the\r\n  County conveyed to Fox the interest it had in the property, free and clear of\r\n  the federal lien, then Fox likewise took the property free and clear of the invalid\r\n  lien.Â  They further argue the â€œexcept as otherwise providedâ€ language in\r\n  section 7425 means that it only applies to valid liens.Â  Therefore, since the\r\n  present federal lien was invalid, the failure to give the IRS notice of the tax\r\n  sale was of no consequence.Â  Appellants extensively cite congressional history\r\n  on these sections to support their argument that a county ad valorem tax sale\r\n  extinguishes an IRS tax lien as to the property.[4]Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhile it is understandable how Appellants interpret the â€œshall not\r\n  be validâ€ language in section 6323 to mean the lien was extinguished, their\r\n  interpretation ignores the clear wording of the statutes themselves.Â  Section\r\n  6323(b)(6)(A) provides protection for â€œa holder of a lien upon such property,\r\n  if such lien is entitled under local law to priority . . . and such lien\r\n  secures payment ofâ€ a property tax.Â  Nothing in section 6323 provides that the\r\n  purchaser of a property subject to both a local property tax lien and a federal\r\n  lien takes the property free of the federal lien. Â Congress certainly could\r\n  have listed a subsequent purchaser in section 6323, but it opted not to.[5] Â This interpretation is also\r\n  consistent with section 6322, providing that the federal lien continues with\r\n  the property until the lien is satisfied.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 6322 (2002).Â  \r\nLooking to other subsections within section 6323, Congress gave other\r\n  indications that the phrase â€œshall not be validâ€ indicates priority of\r\n  liens, not the total invalidation of a lien.Â  Section 6323(e), entitled,\r\n  â€œPriority of interest and expenses,â€ provides that â€œ[i]f the lien imposed by\r\n  section 6321 is not valid as against a lien or security interest, the priority of such lien or security interest shall extend toâ€ any interest or carrying\r\n  charges on the obligation secured, the reasonable expenses incurred in\r\n  collecting or enforcing the lien, and the amount paid to satisfy a lien with\r\n  priority over a federal lien.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 6323(e) (2002) (emphasis added).[6]Â  Thus, in addition to giving certain\r\n  liens priority, the section allows priority for the collection of fees and\r\n  costs necessary to enforce the lien.Â  The section makes clear that Congress\r\n  intended the phrase â€œnot valid againstâ€ to indicate priority.Â  An IRS lien that\r\n  is â€œnot validâ€ against a local property tax lien does not evaporate once a\r\n  local nonjudicial tax sale occurs.Â  \r\nFurther, our courts have looked at this section and also\r\n  determined that it provides for the priority of liens, not the\r\n  extinguishment of them.Â  In Taylor v. Mill, Taylor purchased property at\r\n  a federal tax lien sale, failed to record his deed, and meanwhile, the same\r\n  property was sold to someone else at a county delinquent property tax sale.Â  In\r\n  reviewing section 6323(b)(6), this Court noted that it provides that a countyâ€™s\r\n  tax lien has priority over a federal lien, and thus, Taylor purchased the\r\n  property still subject to the countyâ€™s lien.Â  Taylor v. Mill, 310\r\n  S.C. 526, 528, 426 S.E.2d 311, 312 (1992).Â  Thus, this Court has already noted\r\n  that section 6323 operates to establish priority, not extinguish liens.Â  \r\nInterpreting all of the sections together, section 6323 (b)(6)(A)\r\n  provides that the federal lien is subordinated to the Countyâ€™s lien; it does\r\n  not render the federal lien invalid as to the property itself or any other\r\n  party.Â  See, e.g., In re Tabone, Inc., 175 B.R. 855, 859 n.8\r\n  (Bankr. D.N.J. 1994) (noting that section 6323(b)(6)(A) provides that the\r\n  townshipâ€™s tax liens hold priority status over the federal lien); Hinkley\r\n    &amp; Donovan, 424 F.Supp. at 1019; Amos, 287\r\n  F.Supp. at 890-91. Â Thus, the\r\n  federal lien remained valid and survived the Countyâ€™s tax sale.Â  Because the\r\n  IRS was not given notice of the Countyâ€™s tax sale after the IRS had filed\r\n  notice of its lien on the property, the lien attached to the property and Fox\r\n  purchased the property subject to the lien.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 7425(b)(1) (holding\r\n  that where property subject to the IRSâ€™s timely filed lien is sold during a\r\n  nonjudicial sale and the IRS is not given notice of the sale, the sale of the\r\n  property is made subject to and without disturbing the lien).Â  While the County\r\n  argues that interpreting the section in this manner will stifle tax sales,\r\n  potential buyers must research tax sale property purchases and would be put on\r\n  notice of any federal tax liens.[7] \r\nFinally,\r\n  Appellants argue that the master erred by not giving section 6323, a more\r\n  specific statute, priority over section 7425, a general statute.Â  See Capco\r\n    of Summerville, Inc. v. J.H. Gayle Constr. Co., 368 S.C. 137, 142, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 38, 41 (2006) (holding that a specific statutory provision prevails over\r\n  a more general one).Â  While this is a correct statement of the law, it does not\r\n  appear this argument was ruled upon by the master, and thus, it is not\r\n  preserved.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the\r\n  lower court are not preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nTo\r\n  summarize, there is controversy regarding whether the â€œshall not be validâ€\r\n  language from section 6323 applies to the property or to the entity imposing an\r\n  ad valorem tax on the property, and whether it indicates the federal lien is\r\n  extinguished or merely subordinated.Â  It is the opinion of this Court that\r\n  section 6323 merely provides that the federal lien becomes subordinate to the\r\n  local property tax lien, but the lien remains with the property.Â  The IRS\r\n  properly filed notice of the lien with both the probate court and the\r\n  Charleston County R.M.C office, such that anyone researching the property would\r\n  be aware it was subject to a federal tax lien.Â  Because the lien was valid as\r\n  to the property and no notice of the nonjudicial sale was given to the IRS, the\r\n  sale to Fox was â€œsubject to and without disturbingâ€ the federal tax lien.Â  26\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§ 7425(b).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION[8]\r\nOur\r\n  review of the federal law convinces us that the federal lien was merely subordinate\r\n  to, and not extinguished by, the Countyâ€™s ad valorum tax lien.Â  Because the\r\n  federal government was not given notice of the nonjudicial sale, the law\r\n  provides that the federal tax lien survived the sale.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  masterâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nMOORE, Acting Chief\r\n  Justice, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Lockemy, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  Under 26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 7425(c)(1), the notice of a nonjudicial sale of property\r\n  â€œshall be given . . . in writing, by registered or certified mail or by\r\n  personal service, not less than 25 days prior to such sale, to the Secretary.â€Â \r\n  The section further provides that the nonjudicial sale of the property â€œshall\r\n  discharge or divest such property of the lien or title of the United States if the United States consents to the sale of such property free of such lien or\r\n  title.â€Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 7425(c)(2) (2002) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n[2]Â \r\n  This amount has recently been amended to $1,320.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 6323(b)(4)\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\n[3]Â \r\n  Likewise, this amount has recently been changed to $6,600.Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n  6323(b)(7) (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\n[4]Â \r\n  The congressional history of section 6323 does show\r\n  that Congress intended to protect certain individuals from being surprised by a\r\n  federal tax lien that has not been filed, or â€œsecret lien,â€ and thus, certain\r\n  entities were given priority over the federal liens.Â  However, this history\r\n  does not indicate that section 6323 was intended to extinguish the\r\n  federal liens.Â  In fact, the Congressional history regarding subsection (b)(6)\r\n  specifically notes that local and state property taxes and assessments are\r\n  given priority over federal liens.Â  There is no indication that the liens were\r\n  extinguished completely.Â  \r\n[5]Â \r\n  To illustrate their belief that the masterâ€™s interpretation was erroneous,\r\n  Appellants argue that it would be ridiculous for a federal lien, declared\r\n  invalid by section 6323, to â€œspring back to lifeâ€ upon the later resale by the\r\n  entities entitled to priority in section 6323(b).Â  They cite the example of an\r\n  unknowing consumer purchasing socks from a store with a federal lien in place\r\n  on the stock of the store.Â  While we agree with Appellants that it would seem\r\n  impossible, at best, for the IRS to attempt to recover on the lien should the\r\n  consumer attempt to re-sell the socks, we are not asked to determine that\r\n  question in this case.Â  Real property is very different from mere personal\r\n  property in that it is immovable and there are strict recording requirements in\r\n  place.Â  It is much easier for local and federal governments to keep track of\r\n  real property - and for a prospective purchaser of property at a delinquent tax\r\n  sale to be put on notice of any federal liens -- by consulting the local R.M.C.\r\n  office.\r\n[6]Â \r\n  Similar to the socks argument, Appellants also asserted at oral argument that\r\n  it would be ridiculous to apply such an interpretation to the further transfer\r\n  of property, such as where the State or County office decided to donate land\r\n  seized for delinquent property taxes to the forfeited land commission.Â  While\r\n  we understand the argument, we believe the federal law is intended to do\r\n  nothing more than allow both the local and federal governments to collect\r\n  delinquent taxes.Â  To allow a Countyâ€™s decision to transfer property instead of\r\n  collect its lien to extinguish the federal lien would amount to a windfall to\r\n  local and state governments.Â  This is not something clearly intended by the\r\n  law.Â  \r\n[7]Â \r\n  In fact, proposed legislation was introduced in Congress in 2007 that would\r\n  establish a national Federal tax lien registry so that persons buying property\r\n  could check tax lien status on the internet instead of having to go the local\r\n  R.M.C. office.Â  S. 2394, 110th Cong.

(2007).Â \r\n  However, that has no impact on this case.Â  \r\n[8]Â  The various Charleston County offices also argue that\r\n  because the IRS failed to redeem the property during the redemption period, the\r\n  federal lien was discharged in spite of the masterâ€™s interpretation of federal\r\n  law.Â  While the question of whether the IRSâ€™s failure to redeem the property\r\n  during the redemption period was before the master, it does not appear the\r\n  master addressed the question in the order.Â  It also does not appear that the\r\n  parties filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to request that the master address the\r\n  question.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for appellate review and we decline\r\n  to address it.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26547","title":"Myrick v.

Robinson and the\r\n  law firm Nexsen Pruet Jacobs Pollard &amp; Robinson (collectively â€œNexsen\r\n  Pruetâ€) brought a motion in the trial court requesting that the court find that\r\n  the respondents, Eric S. Bland and Ronald L. Richter, Jr., violated a\r\n  protective order and a settlement agreement entered in litigation between\r\n  Nexsen Pruet and the plaintiffs captioned in this action.Â  Bland and Richter\r\n  represented the plaintiffs in the merits phase of the litigation, and in order\r\n  to provide a complete factual background for this appeal, it is necessary to\r\n  recap the events leading up to the lawsuit and the settlement.\r\nThe\r\n  litigation underlying this appeal began when the plaintiffs\r\n  captioned in this action, James W. Myrick, Pinnacle Land &amp; Timber Company,\r\n  High Bluff Developers, and Shoreline Development (collectively â€œMyrickâ€) sued Nexsen\r\n  Pruet alleging legal malpractice.Â  Myrickâ€™s claim was based on a purported\r\n  conflict of interest in Nexsen Pruetâ€™s alleged representation of both Myrick\r\n  and a competitor in a prospective real estate transaction.Â  In his discovery\r\n  requests, Myrick sought several of Nexsen Pruetâ€™s internal documents such as\r\n  billing records, financial statements, and policy manuals outlining Nexsen\r\n  Pruetâ€™s procedure for checking for conflicts of interest.Â  As part of its\r\n  response to this discovery, Nexsen Pruet produced several documents which the\r\n  parties collectively refer to as a â€œpolicy manualâ€ for opening files and\r\n  checking conflicts.Â  The parties entered into a protective order which provided\r\n  that all documents marked by the parties as â€œconfidentialâ€ would be used â€œonly\r\n  for purposes of this litigation,â€ and contained a stipulation that all internal\r\n  materials related to Nexsen Pruetâ€™s policies and procedures would be treated as\r\n  confidential material.Â  Most importantly, the order expressly prohibited the\r\n  use of confidential material in any other litigation â€œor for any other\r\n  purpose,â€ and required that all confidential material be returned upon written\r\n  demand at the conclusion of the litigation.\r\nThe parties eventually settled the case and entered\r\n  into a consent order of dismissal.Â  The settlement agreement contained a\r\n  â€œcovenant of strict confidentialityâ€ which provided:\r\n\r\n\tThe parties to this settlement agreement and release\r\n  agree that the terms and conditions of this settlement agreement and release,\r\n  including but not limited to the amount of the payment, shall be held in strict\r\n  confidence and shall not be disclosed to any person . . . .Â  If asked about the\r\n  settlement, the parties hereto agree that the only affirmative response shall\r\n  be that the matter was resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the settlement agreement contained a provision entitled â€œenforcement of\r\n  confidentiality.â€Â  That clause provided:\r\n\r\n\tThe parties to this [settlement agreement] hereto\r\n  acknowledge and agree:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(a) \r\n\t\t\tthat the covenant of confidentiality is a material \r\n\t\t\tand essential term of the [settlement agreement] . . . \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(b) \r\n\t\t\tthat a violation of the covenant of confidentiality \r\n\t\t\twill necessarily cause damages and injury to the non-breaching party&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t. . . and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(c) \r\n\t\t\tthat neither monetary damages nor any other remedy \r\n\t\t\tat law may be adequate or sufficient to protect the non-breaching \r\n\t\t\tparties if there is a breach, and that, because such damages are \r\n\t\t\tdifficult to calculate, $10,000 shall constitute a reasonable and \r\n\t\t\tfair estimate of the minimum damages to be suffered . . . as a \r\n\t\t\tresult of such breach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If [] an action or motion \r\n\t\t\tis brought and a violation of the covenant of confidentiality is \r\n\t\t\tdemonstrated and supported by affidavit or other proof, the \r\n\t\t\tbreaching persons shall be liable, at a minimum, for the liquidated \r\n\t\t\tdamages set forth herein ($10,000), any additional damages as may be \r\n\t\t\tproven, and for the attorneysâ€™ fees and costs incurred of the \r\n\t\t\tnon-breaching party bringing the proceeding.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nMyrick,\r\n  Bland, and Richter executed the settlement agreement, and it is instructive to\r\n  note that the settlement agreement contained an attestation that all materials\r\n  designated as confidential in the protective order had been either returned to\r\n  Nexsen Pruet or destroyed.[1]\r\nAbout two years after the parties executed the\r\n  settlement agreement, Bland and Richter filed a complaint alleging legal\r\n  malpractice against Nexsen Pruet on behalf of Frank Robertson, another former\r\n  client of the firm.Â  Bland and Richter again sought discovery of several of\r\n  Nexsen Pruetâ€™s internal documents.Â  During discovery, Bland and Richter\r\n  apparently grew concerned that although they requested â€œan entire Nexsen Pruet\r\n  manualâ€ related to conflicts of interest, they initially received only a few\r\n  redacted pages and not the full policy manual received in the Myrick case.Â  At some point, Bland and Richter discovered that they were in fact still\r\n  in possession of copies of the policy manual which had been produced in the Myrick litigation.Â  Bland and Richer alleged that they had overlooked these copies\r\n  in their attempts to purge their files of confidential material because the\r\n  copies were attached as exhibits to depositions in the Myrick case.\r\nBland and Richter notified Nexsen Pruetâ€™s counsel in\r\n  the Robertson litigation that they were in possession of â€œthe entire\r\n  [Nexsen Pruet] manual,â€ and shortly thereafter, Bland and Richter introduced\r\n  the policy manual as an exhibit during the deposition of Nexsen Pruetâ€™s\r\n  corporate designee for discovery.Â  Nexsen\r\n  Pruetâ€™s then-counsel contacted the Charleston attorney who represented Nexsen\r\n  Pruet in the Myrick litigation and allegedly informed him how discovery\r\n  had proceeded with respect to the policy manual.Â  Shortly after this contact,\r\n  Nexsen Pruet filed a motion under the caption of the Myrick case to\r\n  enforce the settlement agreement.Â  Nexsen Pruet alleged that Bland and Richter\r\n  had violated the terms of the protective order as well as the settlement agreement,\r\n  and Nexsen Pruet requested damages, attorneysâ€™ fees, and a determination of\r\n  whether Bland and Richter were in contempt.\r\nWhile\r\n  Bland and Richter argued that their continued possession of the policy manual\r\n  was inadvertent, Nexsen Pruet argued that it was calculated and deliberate.Â  In\r\n  support of their contention, Nexsen Pruet offered printouts from Bland and\r\n  Richterâ€™s firm website which touted the amount of a settlement of â€œa legal\r\n  malpractice/breach of fiduciary claim against one of South Carolinaâ€™s largest\r\n  firms,â€ as well as e-mails from Bland to Nexsen Pruetâ€™s counsel in the Robertson litigation containing inflammatory and inappropriate language.Â  Nexsen\r\n  Pruet additionally offered a picture of a display in Bland and Richterâ€™s\r\n  office.Â  This picture shows Richter holding a blow-up of a check that is\r\n  drafted payable to â€œBland Law Firm and Richter Law Firm, and their client James\r\n  W. Myrick.â€ Â The amount of the check is listed as â€œ$$$$$$$$ Big Money\r\n  $$$$$$$$.â€Â  Bland is positioned to one side of the check and is shaking the\r\n  hand of a person on the opposite of the check. The face of Neil C. Robinson,\r\n  the Nexsen Pruet attorney whose conduct was primarily at issue in the Myrick case, is super-imposed over the face of the person shaking Blandâ€™s hand in\r\n  the display.\r\nThe trial court held that Bland and Richter had not\r\n  materially breached the protective order or the settlement agreement, declined to award any damages or equitable\r\n  relief, and declined to hold either Bland or Richter in contempt.Â  The trial\r\n  court specifically held that Bland and Richterâ€™s possession of the policy\r\n  manual was an unintentional oversight, that there was no evidence of an\r\n  inappropriate intent to harm, and that upon discovering that they were still in\r\n  possession of the policy manual, Bland and Richter immediately contacted Nexsen\r\n  Pruetâ€™s counsel in the Robertson case.Â  Nexsen Pruet appealed.\r\nThis\r\n  Court certified the appeal from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR.Â  Nexsen Pruet presents the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in holding that Bland and \r\n\t\t\tRichter did not violate the protective order and the settlement \r\n\t\t\tagreement by retaining the policy manual and by introducing the \r\n\t\t\tmanual in subsequent litigation?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in holding that neither \r\n\t\t\tBland and Richterâ€™s website testimonial nor their office display \r\n\t\t\tviolated the settlement agreementâ€™s covenant of confidentiality?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in failing to hold Bland \r\n\t\t\tand Richter in contempt?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â  The Policy Manual\r\nNexsen\r\n  Pruet argues that the trial court erred in concluding that Bland and Richterâ€™s conduct\r\n  with respect to the policy manual was not a material breach of the settlement\r\n  agreement and did not warrant any relief.Â  We agree.\r\nOur\r\n  analysis on this issue must take a rather unusual direction, because as a\r\n  starting point, Bland and Richter seem to agree that they violated the\r\n  protective order and the settlement agreement by failing to see that all\r\n  confidential materials produced by Nexsen Pruet were returned to the firm or\r\n  destroyed and by using the policy manual in subsequent litigation as a\r\n  deposition exhibit.Â  Bland and Richter instead argue (1) that Nexsen Pruet\r\n  waived the right to enforce this provision of the protective order and\r\n  settlement agreement; (2) that Nexsen Pruet suffered no harm due to Bland and\r\n  Richterâ€™s continued possession of the policy manual; and (3) that because the\r\n  policy manual was sought as discovery in the Robertson litigation, Bland\r\n  and Richter should be held harmless for their technical breach.Â  After taking\r\n  these arguments in turn, we find that none of them are persuasive.\r\nBland\r\n  and Richter hinge their waiver argument on the conduct of Nexsen Pruetâ€™s\r\n  attorney in the Robertson litigation.Â  Bland and Richter allege that\r\n  they informed Nexsen Pruetâ€™s attorney that they were in possession of documents\r\n  which were the subject of a protective order, that the attorney gave Bland and\r\n  Richter assurances that Nexsen Pruet would not seek enforcement of the\r\n  protective order and settlement agreement, and that Bland and Richter were\r\n  â€œinduced by [Nexsen Pruetâ€™s] inactivityâ€ to use the policy manual in the Robertson deposition.\r\nBut\r\n  the evidence in the record belies this characterization.Â  Although the record\r\n  supports Bland and Richterâ€™s assertion that they advised Nexsen Pruetâ€™s\r\n  attorney that they were in possession of the policy manual, there is no\r\n  evidence that Bland and Richter offered this advisement as any sort of cautious\r\n  notice that they were in possession of documents covered under a protective\r\n  order, nor is there evidence Bland and Richter were seeking any advice as to\r\n  how to proceed and honor that protective order.Â  The record instead reflects\r\n  that Bland and Richter attempted to use the continued possession of the policy\r\n  manual as leverage in discovery, and this is exhibited by the dialogue between\r\n  the parties where Bland and Richter matter-of-factly assert that they â€œknow\r\n  that [additional] documents exist[,]â€ that they have â€œthe entire [Nexsen Pruet]\r\n  manual[,]â€ that they â€œobtained [the policy manual] from the Myrick case[,]â€\r\n  and that they intend to use the policy manual in the upcoming deposition of\r\n  Nexsen Pruetâ€™s corporate designee for discovery.Â \r\n  This bold course of conduct, characterized by the advertisement that they\r\n  intended to use the materials in discovery, does not evidence a cautious\r\n  approach to discovery cognizant of the trial courtâ€™s previous pronouncements\r\n  regarding how to treat confidential materials. Â We therefore are not persuaded\r\n  by Bland and Richterâ€™s attempts to characterize their conduct in this manner.\r\nBland\r\n  and Richterâ€™s argument regarding waiver is further undercut by the response\r\n  they received after first advising Nexsen Pruetâ€™s attorney of their continued\r\n  possession of the policy manual.Â  Specifically, Nexsen Pruetâ€™s attorney responded\r\n  â€œ[p]lease describe those documents and I will discuss with [Nexsen Pruet].Â  I\r\n  understand that there is a protective order in place in Myrick and agree\r\n  that this description/identification will not violate that order.Â  No term or\r\n  provision of the protective order is being waived or modified.â€[2]Â \r\n  This is strong evidence cutting against Bland and Richterâ€™s waiver argument,\r\n  and in light of the settlement agreementâ€™s requirement that all waivers be\r\n  executed in writing, as well as the court-entered protective order, which no\r\n  single party could waive, we find that there are simply too many hurdles for\r\n  Bland and Richterâ€™s waiver argument to overcome.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court did not address the issue of waiver but instead focused on the fact\r\n  that Nexsen Pruet eventually produced the policy manual during discovery in the Robertson case without a protective order being issued.Â  The trial court\r\n  also noted that Nexsen Pruet had not demonstrated how it has been harmed by\r\n  Bland and Richterâ€™s continued possession of the policy manual.Â  In our view,\r\n  these facts are not instructive.\r\nThe\r\n  â€œmootnessâ€ argument based on the production of the policy manual in the Robertson litigation presumes too much.Â  While it is true that there is not currently\r\n  a protective order in place in the Robertson litigation, that litigation\r\n  is ongoing and the record reflects that at one time, Bland and Richter agreed\r\n  to enter into a protective order similar to the one entered into in Myrick.Â \r\n  Although it might have been possible to raise a ripeness question in this\r\n  appeal given the possibility that the Robertson litigation might\r\n  ultimately conclude without an order or agreement requiring the return or\r\n  destruction of all Nexsen Pruetâ€™s internal documents, neither party addressed\r\n  this issue and we express no opinion on it.Â  We instead focus on the fact that\r\n  the circumstances in this case involve the retention of documents in direct violation\r\n  of a court order and that for no apparent reason, the court system was not\r\n  asked to make a preliminary call regarding the retention of the policy manual\r\n  until after the manual had been used in subsequent litigation.\r\nThe\r\n  notion that Nexsen Pruet has an interest in seeing that Bland and Richter do\r\n  not forever retain copies of internal Nexsen Pruet documents is quite reasonable.Â Â \r\n  For this reason, the fact that the Court might order Bland and Richter to\r\n  destroy some copies of the policy manual but allow the continued possession of\r\n  other copies of the same document is not at all inconsistent.Â  This sheds light\r\n  on an underlying problem of Bland and Richterâ€™s argument, which is that at\r\n  bottom, their position seems to be that subsequent events can render it\r\n  acceptable for a party to unilaterally decide to violate the terms of a court\r\n  order.Â  It is undisputed that the protective order required the return of all\r\n  confidential documents disclosed in discovery.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  characterization of Bland and Richterâ€™s action in notifying Nexsen Pruetâ€™s\r\n  counsel â€œcommendably and immediatelyâ€ after discovering the policy manual,\r\n  whether correct or incorrect, is irrelevant.Â  Bland and Richter did not return\r\n  the policy manual after discovering it, and they in fact made the policy manual\r\n  part of the record in a separate piece of litigation.Â  For this reason, it is\r\n  clear that Bland and Richter breached the terms of the protective order and the\r\n  settlement agreement.\r\nAlthough\r\n  we find that they proceeded improperly, Bland and Richter do not bear all of\r\n  the fault in this situation, because as Bland and Richter point out, this\r\n  dispute originated with what they felt was Nexsen Pruetâ€™s incomplete and\r\n  misleading production of documents during discovery.Â  But although Nexsen Pruet\r\n  ultimately stipulated that it should have supplied â€œthe complete policy manualâ€\r\n  with its initial discovery responses, there is no information in this record indicating\r\n  that Nexsen Pruet intended to be misleading or give incomplete information in\r\n  discovery when it produced a different set of documents in the Robertson litigation\r\n  as it did in the Myrick litigation. Â Again, we recognize that the record\r\n  evidences confusion about certain\r\n  documents which might have been outdated and for non-attorney use, and it\r\n  further appears that in handling the Robertson case, Nexsen Pruet\r\n  engaged in-house and outside counsel who had no knowledge of the intricacies of\r\n  the Myrick litigation.Â  The confusion related to the discovery provided\r\n  in the two sets of litigation seems more a case of the left and right handsâ€™\r\n  failure to communicate as opposed to an act of calculated deception.Â  If there were evidence of such an act, our analysis\r\n  might indeed be different.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  therefore hold that the trial court erred in finding that Bland and Richterâ€™s\r\n  possession of the policy manual did not violate the protective order, breach\r\n  the settlement agreement, and did not warrant the grant of any relief.Â  We\r\n  specifically hold that the retention of the policy manual and the introduction\r\n  of that manual in the Robertson litigation violated both the protective\r\n  order and the settlement agreement, and we order that all copies of the policy\r\n  manual which were improperly held following the conclusion of the Myrick litigation\r\n  be returned to Nexsen Pruet within ten days of the issuance of the remittitur in\r\n  this case.Â  This matter is remanded to the trial court for a determination of\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees to be awarded to Nexsen Pruet under the settlement agreement,\r\n  and Bland and Richter are ordered to provide the trial court with affidavits\r\n  attesting to the return of all improperly retained copies of the policy manual\r\n  when that return is completed.[3] \r\nII.Â  The Website and\r\n  Office Display\r\nNexsen\r\n  Pruet argues that the trial court erred in determining that Bland and Richterâ€™s\r\n  website testimonial and their office display were not violations of the\r\n  settlement agreementâ€™s covenant of confidentiality.Â  Although we might agree on\r\n  the merits, this issue is not properly preserved for review.\r\nIt\r\n  is instructive to begin by analyzing how Nexsen Pruet presented the website\r\n  testimonial and the photograph at trial.Â  In the court below, Nexsen Pruet\r\n  argued that Bland and Richter violated the protective order and settlement\r\n  agreement by retaining and using the policy manual, and that circumstantial\r\n  evidence demonstrated that this violation was calculated and willful.Â  As\r\n  circumstantial evidence of willful action, Nexsen Pruet offered e-mails\r\n  containing inappropriate and inflammatory language, the picture in Bland and\r\n  Richterâ€™s office, and the website testimonial.Â  According to Nexsen Pruet, this\r\n  evidence demonstrated that Bland and Richter were out to punish Nexsen Pruet\r\n  and were determined to ignore the letter and spirit of the protective order and\r\n  settlement agreement.\r\nWe\r\n  agree that these e-mails as well as the picture and testimonial demonstrate\r\n  animus and vindictiveness towards Nexsen Pruet, but the inescapable fact is\r\n  that Nexsen Pruet is adopting an argument on appeal which differs significantly\r\n  from the theory of the case it presented at trial.Â  Nexsen Pruetâ€™s motion did\r\n  not assert the website testimonial or the office display as a basis for finding\r\n  a violation of the protective order or settlement agreement, and in this\r\n  regard, Nexsen Pruetâ€™s counsel took care to inform the trial court that these\r\n  were not asserted as violations of the settlement agreement, but were asserted\r\n  in support of a finding of willfulness which was relevant to Nexsen Pruetâ€™s\r\n  motion for contempt.Â  That this distinction was evident at trial is exhibited\r\n  by the fact that Bland and Richterâ€™s counsel noted that the only grounds offered\r\n  as violations of the protective order and settlement agreement were the retention\r\n  and use of the policy manual.Â  Thus, although the trial court expressly ruled\r\n  that the website and office display did not violate the settlement agreement,\r\n  the issue was not presented below and is therefore not preserved for appeal.Â  See\r\n    Hubbard v. Rowe, 192 S.C. 12, 19, 5 S.E.2d 187, 189 (1939) (noting that in\r\n  order to be preserved, an issue must have been both raised to the trial court\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial court).\r\nIII.Â  Contempt\r\nNexsen\r\n  Pruet argues that the trial court erred in failing to hold Bland and Richter in\r\n  contempt.Â  The thrust of Nexsen Pruetâ€™s argument is that the trial court erred\r\n  in focusing on Bland and Richterâ€™s initial possession of the policy manual and\r\n  in failing to take into account Bland and Richterâ€™s conduct after discovering\r\n  the policy manual.Â  While Nexsen Pruet disputes that Bland and Richterâ€™s\r\n  initial possession of the policy manual was â€œinnocent and inadvertent,â€ Nexsen\r\n  Pruet argues that leaving initial possession aside, Bland and Richterâ€™s\r\n  retention of the policy manual and the use of the manual in other litigation\r\n  demonstrates a willful intent to violate the settlement agreement and the\r\n  protective order.Â  We agree.\r\nA\r\n  determination of contempt rests within the sound discretion of the trial court,\r\n  and this Court will reverse a decision regarding contempt only if the trial\r\n  court abused its discretion.Â  Brandt v. Gooding, 368 S.C. 618, 627, 630\r\n  S.E.2d 259, 263 (2006).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling is based upon factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support\r\n  or when the trial courtâ€™s decision is based upon an error of law.Â  Fontaine\r\n    v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 539, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987).\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that Bland and Richter did not\r\n  willfully violate the protective order is without evidentiary support.Â  Leaving\r\n  aside the question of whether Bland and Richterâ€™s initial possession of the\r\n  policy manual was intentional, Bland and Richter both testified at trial that\r\n  upon discovering the wrongfully retained copies of the policy manual, they\r\n  recalled immediately that there was a protective order in place which required\r\n  the return or destruction of the documents.Â  Bland and Richter have not\r\n  disputed that they knew that confidential documents from the Myrick litigation\r\n  were not to be used in any other litigation, and in this vein, the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s conclusion that there was no willful violation of the protective order\r\n  is not supported by the evidence.\r\nWe\r\n  therefore reverse the trial courtâ€™s determination regarding contempt and remand\r\n  this matter to the trial court to determine the appropriate sanction.Â  The\r\n  trial court possesses full discretion in determining the sanction it deems\r\n  appropriate, but we note that the parties agreed in the settlement agreement\r\n  that liquidated damages of $10,000 per violation of the settlement agreementâ€™s\r\n  covenant of confidentiality would constitute a reasonable\r\n  and fair estimate of the minimum damages suffered.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s decision and remand this matter for additional proceedings.Â  \r\nMOORE,\r\n  J., and Acting Justice John W. Kittredge, concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in\r\n  part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in\r\n  a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  I concur in the opinion on\r\n  the merits; however I disagree with the inference that $10,000.00 is an\r\n  appropriate measure of damages for a sanction for contempt of court in this\r\n  case.Â  Initially, I am reminded that an appropriate sanction for contempt of\r\n  court is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Secondly, I am reminded that the\r\n  parties agree that the $10,000.00 liquidated damages provision only applied to\r\n  the covenant of confidentiality and that there was no breach of\r\n  confidentiality.Â  Finally, an award of damages would reward Appellants for\r\n  obvious disingenuous discovery compliance.\r\nIn\r\n  my view, the conduct of both parties is less than desirable and the opinion\r\n  minimizes Appellantsâ€™ failure to comply with discovery requests.Â  This case\r\n  would not be before this court had Appellants not gotten caught providing\r\n  incomplete documents in discovery. Whether Appellantsâ€™ conduct was\r\n  intentional or not is irrelevant. The documents were prepared by them and in\r\n  their possession.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I join Justice Beattyâ€™s opinion expressing concern\r\n  about the majorityâ€™s suggestion that $10,000 might be the appropriate damages\r\n  award here, and write separately to express my disagreement with the merits of\r\n  the majority opinion.\r\nIn prior\r\n  litigation, the circuit court had issued a protective order.Â  When that\r\n  litigation was settled, the Settlement Agreement contained a provision in which\r\n  the respondents agreed they had returned or destroyed all the material covered\r\n  by that order.Â  After learning that respondents had apparently not destroyed or\r\n  returned all the materials, appellants brought this motion seeking a finding\r\n  that respondents were in contempt of the courtâ€™s protective order and in breach\r\n  of the Agreement[4].Â \r\n  Appellants moved for an order denying respondents use of those materials in the\r\n  other litigation, an award of damages, and of attorneys fees.Â  The circuit\r\n  court, after an evidentiary hearing, held that respondentsâ€™ retention of a\r\n  single copy of the manual was â€œunintentionalâ€ and â€œinnocentâ€ and declined to\r\n  award relief, holding any technical breach of the protective order and\r\n  settlement agreement was not material.Â  \r\nAppellants first\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in declining to specifically enforce the\r\n  settlement agreement.[5]Â \r\n  Whether to grant specific performance is a matter committed to â€œsound judicial\r\n  discretion.â€Â  Sumner v. Bankhead, 119 S.C. 78, 111 S.E. 891 (1922).Â \r\n  Here, the trial judge who heard the evidence determined that respondentsâ€™\r\n  retention of the manual was unintentional and inadvertent and therefore\r\n  declined to grant appellants relief.Â  In my view, there is no abuse of\r\n  discretion in denying specific performance where the sole issue before the\r\n  trial court was whether specific performance was warranted by respondentsâ€™\r\n  retention of the document, not their conduct after discovering they still had a\r\n  copy of the manual.Â  Furthermore, I can find no abuse of discretion in the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision to deny appellantsâ€™ request to hold respondents in\r\n  contempt for retaining the manual. Rhoad v. State, 372 S.C. 100, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 35 (Ct. App. 2007) (contempt finding reviewed under abuse of discretion\r\n  standard).Â  I disagree with the majority that in deciding the contempt issue we\r\n  can â€œleave aside the question of whether [respondents] initial possession of\r\n  the policy manual was intentionalâ€ when the sole basis for the appellantsâ€™\r\n  assertion that respondents were in contempt was their retention.Â  Moreover, I\r\n  do not agree we can rely upon respondentsâ€™ use of the manual in the subsequent\r\n  litigation to reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order and hold respondents in\r\n  contempt when the only question before that court was whether the retention\r\n  itself was contumacious.Â  \r\nFor the reasons\r\n  given above, I would affirm the circuit court judgeâ€™s order because I can find no\r\n  abuse of discretion in his finding that respondentsâ€™ retention was\r\n  â€œunintentionalâ€ and â€œinnocentâ€ and his consequent denial of appellantsâ€™\r\n  requests for â€œspecific performanceâ€ and a finding of contempt. Respondentsâ€™\r\n  conduct in emails, in advertising, and in the subsequent litigation is not\r\n  relevant to the issues before that court nor are they relevant to the issues\r\n  properly before this Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In publishing large portions of the settlement agreement, we do not overlook\r\n  the fact that the parties purported to treat the terms of the agreement as\r\n  confidential.Â  In this vein, we issue a note of advisement: although the\r\n  courtâ€™s rules allow litigants to agree to settle and dismiss lawsuits with\r\n  limited court involvement, see Rules 41(a)(1) and 41.1(a), SCRCP, when\r\n  parties seek to use the court system to enforce the provisions of private\r\n  settlement agreements, those agreements become publicly available court records\r\n  absent a properly filed and approved request to seal.\r\n[2] The record reflects that the confusion about what\r\n  constituted a â€œfull policy manualâ€ may have arisen because Nexsen Pruet engaged\r\n  different outside counsel for the Myrick and Robertson matters,\r\n  had different in-house counsel assigned to the cases, and because Nexsen Pruet contended\r\n  certain documents were outdated and were not used by attorneys.Â  \r\n[3] Two points warrant discussion as matters of housekeeping.Â  First, Nexsen Pruet\r\n  does not contest that the settlement agreementâ€™s liquidated damages provision\r\n  applies only to breaches of the agreementâ€™s covenant of confidentiality, and\r\n  that Bland and Richterâ€™s possession and use of the policy manual in no way\r\n  disclosed confidential terms or conditions of the settlement.Â  The liquidated\r\n  damages provision is therefore inapplicable to this violation of the\r\n  agreement.Â  \r\nSecond, as a gateway argument\r\n  on this issue, the parties contest whether the claims for violation of the\r\n  protective order and breach of the settlement agreement sound in law or\r\n  equity.Â  Because we find there is no evidence supporting the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  conclusion that Bland and Richter did not violate the protective order and\r\n  settlement agreement, we need not address these arguments.Â  We note, however,\r\n  that it is well settled that an action for breach of contract seeking money\r\n  damages is an action at law, Eldeco v. Charleston County School District,\r\n  372 S.C. 470, 476, 642 S.E.2d 726, 729 (2007), and that in an action for\r\n  specific performance, an award of â€œspecial damagesâ€ is typically available only\r\n  when necessary to make specific performance complete.Â  Oâ€™Shea v. Lesser,\r\n  308 S.C. 10, 14, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1992); Butler v. Schilletter,\r\n  230 S.C. 552, 96 S.E.2d 661 (1957).\r\n[4] Appellants did not seek any relief based on respondentsâ€™ alleged breach of the\r\n  Agreementâ€™s confidentiality clause based upon respondentsâ€™ emails and\r\n  advertising, but merely introduced this information as evidentiary support for\r\n  their contempt claim, asserting that these actions demonstrated respondents\r\n  acted willfully.Â  At the hearing, appellants based their assertion of breach\r\n  and contempt solely on the fact respondents retained a copy of the manual, not\r\n  upon any other conduct.Â  As the majority properly points out in Part I of the\r\n  opinion, appellants are improperly attempting to raise an issue for the first\r\n  time before this Court. \r\n[5] This is how appellants repeatedly characterize their theory. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Michael J.

Applicants will be notified of the date and time of the admission ceremony.\r\n  (2)\tSpecial Admission Ceremonies.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour,\r\n  Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tDesaÂ  Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the\r\n  Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction provided\r\n  for in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and suspend respondent\r\n  from the practice of law in this state for two years, retroactive to the date\r\n  of her interim suspension.[1]Â  The facts, as set forth in\r\n  the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nI.&nbsp; Guilty Plea\r\n&nbsp;Respondent pled guilty to one count of breach of trust\r\n  in an amount not less than $1,000 but not more than $5,000 related to taking\r\n  fees paid in cash to her law firm and depositing them into her personal\r\n  account.Â  She was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended, and payment of\r\n  court costs.\r\nII.&nbsp; Domestic Matters\r\nRespondent\r\n  was hired to represent Client A in a divorce matter.Â  The parties to the\r\n  divorce agreed to mediation without the presence of their attorneys; however,\r\n  the mediation process was unsuccessful because, according to the mediator,\r\n  Client A was not adequately prepared or advised.Â  From that point on, Client A\r\n  had difficulty communicating with respondent.Â  Client A fired respondent, at\r\n  which time Client A learned that three months earlier respondent left the firm\r\n  she was employed by and left Client Aâ€™s file with that firm.\r\nRespondent\r\n  was hired to represent Client B in another divorce matter.Â  For several months,\r\n  respondent exchanged correspondence regarding settlement with Client Bâ€™s\r\n  husband and later with the husbandâ€™s attorney.Â  However, thereafter, Client B\r\n  had difficulty communicating with respondent.Â  Client B filed a pro se complaint for child support, which was granted at a hearing where she appeared\r\n  unrepresented.Â  Thereafter, respondent contacted Client B and advised her to\r\n  hold off on any further action until one year of continuous separation had\r\n  expired.Â  However, Client B did not hear from respondent after the time period\r\n  expired.Â  Client B fired respondent and asked for a refund of her fee.Â \r\n  Respondent had left Client Bâ€™s file with the law firm where she had been\r\n  employed, and the law firm gave the file to Client B and refunded the fee.\r\n\r\nRespondent\r\n  was hired by Client C to represent him in a domestic matter.Â  Respondent filed\r\n  for an emergency hearing and filed a summons and complaint on Client Câ€™s\r\n  behalf.Â  Emergency relief was granted.Â  Opposing counsel filed responsive\r\n  pleadings, including a counterclaim.Â  Respondent filed a reply.Â  A temporary\r\n  hearing was held.Â  Respondent was in the process of trying to get opposing\r\n  counsel to agree to a proposed order when she was fired by the law firm at\r\n  which she had been employed.Â  Respondent and the law firm wrote separate\r\n  letters to Client C advising him of respondentâ€™s departure from the firm.Â  The\r\n  firm also sent a letter to Client C and opposing counsel advising that another\r\n  attorney in the firm would be handling Client Câ€™s matter until Client C made a\r\n  decision.Â  Neither respondent nor the other attorney from the firm heard\r\n  anything from Client C and assumed the other was handling the matter.Â  The\r\n  other attorney from the firm got the temporary order signed and filed, but took\r\n  no further action.Â  Neither respondent nor the other attorney from the firm\r\n  moved to be relieved from the case.Â  At Client Câ€™s request, respondent took the\r\n  case back up and filed for a final hearing.Â  That hearing was continued at\r\n  least three times because of respondentâ€™s difficulties with her pregnancy and\r\n  maternity leave.Â  After the third continuance, respondent changed her\r\n  membership in the South Carolina Bar to inactive status.Â  She did not timely\r\n  inform Client C or the court of her change in status.Â  Thereafter, the court\r\n  issued a 365 day notice.Â  Client C then went back to the other attorney from\r\n  respondentâ€™s former firm, who negotiated a new fee agreement and pursued the\r\n  case to final decree.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by her conduct she has violated\r\n  the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall explain a matter\r\n  to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed\r\n  decisions regarding the representation, keep the client reasonably informed\r\n  about the status of the matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests\r\n  for information); Rule 1.16(a)(2) (a\r\n  lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced,\r\n  shall withdraw from the representation of a client if the\r\n  lawyerâ€™s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyerâ€™s ability\r\n  to represent the client); Rule 1.16(b)(1) (a lawyer may withdraw from\r\n  representing a client if withdrawal can be accomplished without material\r\n  adverse effect on the interests of the client); Rule 1.16(c) (a lawyer must\r\n  comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when\r\n  terminating a representation); Rule 1.16(d) (upon termination of\r\n  representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable\r\n  to protect a clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the\r\n  client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and\r\n  property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of\r\n  fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable\r\n  efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client);\r\n  Rule 8.4(a)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer\r\n  to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation);\r\n  and Rule 8.4(e)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct\r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent admits her misconduct\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a\r\n  lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be\r\n  a ground for discipline for a lawyer to be\r\n  convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime); and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground\r\n  for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find a two year suspension, retroactive to the date of interim\r\n  suspension, is the appropriate sanction for respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend\r\n  respondent accordingly.Â  Respondent shall not be eligible for reinstatement or\r\n  readmission until she has successfully completed all conditions of her\r\n  sentence, including, but not limited to, any period of probation or parole.Â \r\n  Rule 33(f)(10), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\n  that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension, with her\r\n  consent, on June 26, 2007.Â  In the Matter of Koulpasis, 374 S.C. 163,\r\n  648 S.E.2d 582 (2007).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
