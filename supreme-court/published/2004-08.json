White and \r\n  Little General Food Stores, Inc. (collectively â€œWhiteâ€).Â  White v. J.M. Brown \r\n  Amusement Co., Op. No. 2003-UP-161 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 27, 2003).Â  \r\n  We granted Whiteâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review that decision \r\n  and now reverse.\r\nFACTUAL / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1992, White and J.M. Brown Amusement Co. (â€œBrownâ€) entered into a contract \r\n  giving Brown exclusive rights to place â€œcertain coin-operated amusement machinesâ€ \r\n  in thirteen of Whiteâ€™s storesâ€”which Brown didâ€”all located in Anderson and Oconee \r\n  counties.Â  The contract was for a term of fifteen years.Â  Under the contract, \r\n  White agreed â€œnot to allow other machines on the premises without the express \r\n  written consent of [Brown].â€ \r\nIn 1993, the Legislature enacted a local option law as part of the Video Game \r\n  Machines Act, permitting counties to hold an individual referendum to determine \r\n  whether cash payouts for video gaming should remain legal.Â  Act No. 164, Part \r\n  II, Â§ 19G, 1993 S.C. Acts 1138-1139, formerly codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ \r\n  12-21-2806 and -2808 (repealed effective July 1, 2000).Â  As a result of local \r\n  referenda held in November 1994, twelve counties, including Oconee and Anderson, \r\n  voted to ban cash payouts.Â  The South Carolina Department of Revenue revoked \r\n  the licenses required to operate the machines Brown had placed in Whiteâ€™s stores, \r\n  effective July 1, 1995, as required by the Act.Â  Consequently, Brown removed \r\n  the video poker machines from Whiteâ€™s stores.Â  Brown did not replace the machines \r\n  with any other coin-operated amusement machines.\r\nIn November 1996, this Court struck down the local option law contained in \r\n  the Act as unconstitutional special legislation.Â  Martin v. Condon, 324 \r\n  S.C. 183, 478 S.E.2d 272 (1996).Â  Given this Courtâ€™s ruling, Brown planned to \r\n  return the video poker machines to Whiteâ€™s store, but White informed Brown that \r\n  the contract was no longer valid.Â  White then initiated the underlying action, \r\n  seeking to have the contract declared void and unenforceable so that he would \r\n  be free to sign a contract with another provider of legal video and amusement \r\n  machines. White also alleged that Brown breached the contract by removing the \r\n  machines from Whiteâ€™s stores and failing to replace them with appropriate machines. \r\n\r\nApproximately one month after filing suit, White entered into an agreement \r\n  with Hughes Entertainment, Inc. (â€œHughesâ€), giving Hughes exclusive rights to \r\n  place â€œall video game terminals and all coin operated music and amusement machinesâ€ \r\n  in twelve of the same stores listed in the Brown contract.\r\n In its answer to the complaint, Brown denied breaching the contract, arguing \r\n  that the machines were removed from Whiteâ€™s stores â€œin response to Court and \r\n  legislative proceedings which cast doubt upon the legality of certain coin operated \r\n  machines such as those supplied by [Brown] to [White] under the terms of the \r\n  contract.â€Â  In addition, Brown asserted counterclaims for breach of contract \r\n  and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act because White contracted \r\n  with Hughes for placement of machines in Whiteâ€™s stores.\r\nA representative of Brown testified in deposition that the subject matter of \r\n  the contract was the outlawed video poker machinesâ€”the only type of machines \r\n  Brown handled.Â  White testified in deposition that he expected Brown to install \r\n  other types of legal video games after the video poker machines were outlawed, \r\n  even though White also testified that the contract involved video poker machines, \r\n  and he never asked Brown (from July 1995 to November 1996) to place other types \r\n  of machines in his stores.\r\nWhite moved for summary judgment on Brownâ€™s counterclaims.Â  The trial court \r\n  granted Whiteâ€™s motion, finding that the contract involved the placement and \r\n  operation of outlawed video poker machines. \r\n  [1] Â  The trial court concluded that as a matter of law, the contract between \r\n  White and Brown â€œbecame void and unenforceable as of July 1, 1995, when video \r\n  poker machines first became illegal in Anderson and Oconee counties.â€Â  The trial \r\n  court subsequently denied Brownâ€™s motion to reconsider.\r\nBrown appealed and the court of appeals reversed.Â  The court of appeals reasoned \r\n  that because this Court had struck down the local option law and referenda as \r\n  unconstitutional, the validity of the contract must be analyzed as if the local \r\n  option law had never been enacted, the referenda never held, the county ordinances \r\n  banning video poker payouts never passed, and the machine licenses never revoked \r\n  by the Department of Revenue.\r\nWe granted certiorari to resolve the following question: \r\n  [2] \r\n\r\n  Did the court of appeals err in reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary \r\n    judgment to White, where the trial court found that the contract was void \r\n    and unenforceable as of July 1, 1995, due to local referenda banning the type \r\n    of video poker machine that formed the subject matter of the contract?Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the \r\n  appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant \r\n  to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d \r\n  857, 860 (2002). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue \r\n  of material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 \r\n  S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, \r\n  the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn \r\n  from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Manning \r\n  v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 385, 365 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).\r\nDiscussion\r\nWhite asserts the court of appeals erred because the trial court correctly \r\n  held that as a matter of law, the partiesâ€™ contract became void and unenforceable \r\n  as of July 1, 1995, the date it became illegal to operate the video poker machines.Â  \r\n  White also contends that the contract was not revived when the local option \r\n  law was held unconstitutional.Â  We agree.\r\nThe general rule, well established in South Carolina, is that courts will not \r\n  enforce a contract when the subject matter of the contract or an act required \r\n  for performance violates public policy as expressed in constitutional provisions, \r\n  statutory law, or judicial decisions.Â  Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, \r\n  53-54, 426 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1993) (stating â€œ[a]n illegal contract has always \r\n  been unenforceableâ€); Batchelor v. American Health Ins. Co., 234 S.C. \r\n  103, 107 S.E.2d 36 (1959) (noting that contracts violating public policy as \r\n  expressed in constitutional provisions, statutes, or judicial decisions are \r\n  void).\r\nWhen a contract is originally legal, but performance becomes illegal due to \r\n  a change in the law, any subsequent performance is against public policy and \r\n  the party who has agreed to perform is excused from doing so. Â Some courts analyze \r\n  such a situation in terms of impossibility of performance, although performance \r\n  is not literally â€œimpossibleâ€ because it could be done if it were legal.Â  Other \r\n  courts simply conclude that the duty to perform is excused or discharged because \r\n  performance would violate public policy as expressed in constitutional provisions, \r\n  statutes, or judicial decisions.Â  8 Williston on Contracts Â§ 19:35 (4th \r\n  ed. 1998); 14 Corbin on Contracts Â§ 76.1 (2001); see also Restatement \r\n  (Second) of Contracts Â§ 264 (1981) (â€œif the performance of a duty is made \r\n  impracticable by having to comply with a domestic or foreign governmental regulation \r\n  or order, that regulation or order is an event the non-occurrence of which was \r\n  a basic assumption on which the contract was madeâ€); Restatement (First) \r\n  of Contracts Â§ 458 (1932) (contractual duty is discharged where performance \r\n  is subsequently prevented or prohibited by constitutional provision, statute, \r\n  ordinance, judicial decision, or administrative order); Annot., Modern Status \r\n  of the Rules Regarding Impossibility of Performance as Defense in Action for \r\n  Breach of Contract, 84 A.L.R.2d 12, Â§ 7 (1962).\r\nIn the present case, both parties were performing as required under the contract \r\n  until performance of the contract became legally impossible for two reasons.Â  \r\n  First, the subject matter of the contractâ€”certain video poker machinesâ€”became \r\n  illegal as of July 1, 1995, under the local option law and the resulting local \r\n  referenda.Â  Second, as mandated by the local option law, the Department of Revenue \r\n  revoked the licenses required to legally possess and use the machines.Â  Consequently, \r\n  both partiesâ€™ duty to perform under the contract was discharged, and after that \r\n  point, White and Brown were free to enter a new contract involving legal machines \r\n  or seek other contractual relationships.Â  \r\nMoreover, because the subject matter of the contract \r\n  became illegal, the contract itself was invalidated or rendered â€œdead.â€Â  Therefore, \r\n  the next issue we must address is whether the â€œdeadâ€ contract was revived when \r\n  this Court deemed the local option lawâ€”which permitted counties to hold an individual \r\n  referendum to determine whether cash payouts for video gaming should remain \r\n  legalâ€”unconstitutional.\r\nThe court of appeals implicitly concluded that \r\n  the formerly â€œdeadâ€ contract was indeed revived by the â€œdeathâ€ of the invalid \r\n  law, when the court stated â€œ[i]t is as if the law had never been passed and \r\n  the referenda never held.â€Â  In support of its conclusion, the court of appeals \r\n  relied solely on Atkinson v. Southern Express Co., 94 S.C. 444, 78 S.E. \r\n  516 (1913).Â  In that case, the Court stated the following:Â  \r\n\r\n  When a statute is adjudged to be unconstitutional, it is as if it never had \r\n    been.Â  Rights cannot be built up under it; contracts which depend upon it \r\n    for their consideration are void; it constitutes a protection to no one who \r\n    has acted under it; and no one can be punished for having refused obedience \r\n    to it before the decision was made.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 453, 78 S.E. at 519 (citations and \r\n  internal quotation marks omitted).Â  Based on this precedent, the court of appeals \r\n  concluded that â€œthe ordinance purporting to ban the video poker machines had \r\n  no legal forceâ€ and therefore did not have a legal effect on the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  \r\n\r\nGiven the court of appealsâ€™ decision, Brown asserts that the invalidation of \r\n  the local option law somehow revived the dead contract for the remainder of \r\n  its fifteen-year term.Â  Brown essentially is asking us to reshape the course \r\n  of events and impact those events had on the partiesâ€™ contractual relationship \r\n  by pretending that the unconstitutional statute and the local referenda never \r\n  existed.\r\nWe reject Brownâ€™s argument and hold the contract was not revived by the subsequent \r\n  invalidation of the local option law.Â  This holding allows parties to conduct \r\n  business and plan their affairs with some degree of certainty.Â  Life goes on \r\n  while judicial or legislative processes run their course.Â  In the meantime, \r\n  parties must arrange and conduct their business affairs under the law as it \r\n  presently exists, regardless of a belief or hope the law will later be changed \r\n  or invalidated.\r\n We find this result to be consistent with precedent, including the recently \r\n  decided case of Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 358 S.C. 388, \r\n  596 S.E.2d 42 (2004).Â  In Bergstrom, we held that a 1977 statute, which \r\n  modified charitable immunity as it applied to hospitals, was void ab initio \r\n  when it was declared unconstitutional in 1992.Â  As a result, the unconstitutional \r\n  1977 statute did not impact a suit brought against a hospital in 1998, given \r\n  that the plaintiffâ€™s cause of action accrued in 1979 and must be based on the \r\n  law as it existed.Â  This result was proper because there were no rights and \r\n  relationships that already had been determined and settled by past events and \r\n  transactions.\r\n\r\n  When a statute is found unconstitutional, we have recognized the general \r\n    rule that an adjudication of [the] unconstitutionality of a statute ordinarily \r\n    reaches back to the date of the act itself. . . .Â Â Â  However, we also have \r\n    recognized the necessity of upholding the validity of transactions or events \r\n    that occurred before a statute was declared unconstitutional. . . . A close \r\n    reading of the few South Carolina cases discussing the general rule indicates \r\n    it is followed except in special or unusual circumstances, such as \r\n    when doing so would create widespread havoc involving a great number of people \r\n    or transactions, spawn unnecessary litigation, or result in flagrant injustice.\r\n\r\nBergstrom, 358 S.C. at 399-400, 596 S.E.2d \r\n  at 47-48 (citations and quotes omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nIn Bergstrom, we relied in part on the broad \r\n  principles set forth in Atkinson regarding the impact of a finding that \r\n  a statute is unconstitutional.Â  The issue in Atkinson was whether a recently \r\n  enacted federal statute revived certain state alcohol statutes, which previously \r\n  had been deemed unconstitutional because they violated federal interstate commerce \r\n  principles.Â  In explaining why the state statutes were not revived or validated \r\n  by the new federal act, the Court recited several principles emphasizing the \r\n  void nature of an unconstitutional statute.Â  Id. at 453, 78 S.E. at 519.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Atkinson Court was faced with the issue \r\n  of whether to grant an injunction to the plaintiff because the unconstitutional \r\n  statutes were of no import, i.e., the Court had to evaluate the partiesâ€™ present \r\n  rights and duties in light of the void statutes.Â  In contrast, the present case \r\n  requires us to examine past events and transactions in determining, first, \r\n  the impact a presumptively valid statute had on the partiesâ€™ then-existing contractual \r\n  rights and duties, and second, the impact a later finding of unconstitutionality \r\n  had on the then-existing rights and duties.Â  We recognize that the general principles \r\n  expressed in Atkinsonâ€”though inadequate to resolve the issues in this \r\n  caseâ€”are appropriate in other settings, and therefore we decline to overrule \r\n  that decision.Â  \r\n In sum, this case presents a special or unusual circumstance in which we must \r\n  uphold the validity of transactions or events that occurred before a statute \r\n  was declared unconstitutional.Â  The contract for video poker machines became \r\n  void and unenforceable by either party as of July 1, 1995, due to referenda \r\n  under the local option law and the revocation of the machine licenses by the \r\n  Department of Revenue.Â  Moreover, our finding that the local option law was \r\n  unconstitutionalâ€”sixteen months after the partiesâ€™ duty to perform under the \r\n  contract was discharged according to a long-established principle of contract \r\n  lawâ€”did not breathe life back into the contract.\r\nConclusion\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE \r\n  the court of appealsâ€™ decision and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor \r\n  of White on Brownâ€™s breach of contract counterclaim.Â  The trial court correctly \r\n  ruled that the sole subject matter of the contract was the outlawed video poker \r\n  machines.Â  Neither party breached the contract, and therefore neither party \r\n  is entitled to damages.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Aphrodite K.. Konduros, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The parties debate the meaning of the contractual term â€œcertain coin-operated \r\n    amusement machines.â€Â  We conclude that the trial court correctly relied on \r\n    the deposition testimonies of White and the Brown representative to determine \r\n    that this was a typical contract involving video poker machines at convenience \r\n    stores, a type of contract common in South Carolina at the time.Â  The parties \r\n    debate whether the judgeâ€™s finding was the unappealed law of the case, or \r\n    whether the contract also contemplated Pac-Man video games or the like.Â  Again, \r\n    we find that it was a contract for video poker machines.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Whiteâ€™s two questions actually present only one question.Â  We also \r\n    note that this case does not raise any issue under the Contract Clause contained \r\n    in the state or federal constitutions, which prohibits the state from passing \r\n    laws which impair the obligation of contracts.Â  We have rejected such a claim \r\n    in connection with legislative control of video poker gambling.Â  Rickâ€™s \r\n    Amusement, Inc. v.

Hall allowed her to escape and then \r\n  walked into the woods behind the store waving his gun in the air.\r\nA half hour later, Hall approached two teenage girls, who were sisters, in \r\n  the back parking lot.Â  In front of numerous witnesses and without provocation, \r\n  Hall shot and killed the two girls.Â  When the police arrived and finally cornered \r\n  Hall, he challenged the police with a piece of wood and dared the police to \r\n  shoot him. \r\nHall has both mental and physical disabilities.Â  \r\n  He currently takes, and was taking during trial, Dilantin and Phenobarbital \r\n  to prevent epileptic seizures.Â  Dilantin has a sedative effect similar to the \r\n  effects of alcohol.Â  At the time of his arraignment, Hall had twice the amount \r\n  of Dilantin in his bloodstream than the normal therapeutic amount. \r\n  [1] Â  Hallâ€™s sister, mother, and former employer all testified that Hallâ€™s \r\n  seizures and medications make it very difficult for him to complete simple everyday \r\n  tasks and that he is often in a â€œdazeâ€ or â€œin the fog.â€Â  Hall has a â€œgrossly \r\n  abnormalâ€ EEG, [2]  as the result \r\n  of his having epilepsy.Â  \r\nHall has been diagnosed \r\n  with â€œsensory dysfunction,â€ deficient language abilities, and deficient organizational \r\n  abilities.Â  He suffers from both organic personality disorderâ€”which may cause \r\n  uncontrollable mood shifts and outbursts of aggressionâ€”and schizoid personality, \r\n  which makes Hall indifferent to praise or punishment.Â  Hall is also borderline \r\n  mentally retarded, having an IQ of 72.\r\nIn August 1991, six months \r\n  before Hallâ€™s trial, a group of doctors at the Hall Institute in Columbia evaluated \r\n  Hall and found him competent to stand trial.Â  One doctor, however, testified \r\n  that Hallâ€™s competency was â€œborderlineâ€ and a â€œtouch and goâ€ issue.Â Â  Hall was \r\n  not evaluated again before his trial.Â  \r\nDuring closing argument, \r\n  the solicitor directed the jury to weigh the worth of Hallâ€™s life against the \r\n  lives of Hallâ€™s victims:Â  â€œ[w]hat are the lives of these two girls worth?Â  Are \r\n  they worth at least the life of a man, the psychopath, this killer who stabs \r\n  and stabs and kills and rapes and kidnaps?â€Â  Hall was then convicted of murder, \r\n  kidnapping, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, armed robbery, and resisting \r\n  arrest and was sentenced to death.\r\nHall subsequently applied for PCR, and the PCR judge denied relief directing \r\n  the state to draft an order, which the trial judge adopted in full, without \r\n  alterations.Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the following issues:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.\r\n    \r\n    Did the PCR judge err in applying a heightened burden of proof \r\n      to determine whether Hall was competent to stand trial?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.\r\n    \r\n    Was Hallâ€™s trial counsel ineffective for failing to object \r\n      to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, which compared the worth of Hallâ€™s \r\n      life to the victimsâ€™ lives?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    III.\r\n    \r\n    Did the PCR judge err in adopting the stateâ€™s proposed order \r\n      in its entirety?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court must determine whether any probative \r\n  evidence exists to support the denial of post-conviction relief.Â  Cherry \r\n  v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1980).Â  If any probative \r\n  evidence exists, the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling should be upheld.Â  Id.\r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Competency \r\n  to Stand Trial\r\n A.Â  Burden of Proof\r\nHall argues that the PCR judge applied the wrong standard \r\n  of proof in deciding whether Hall was competent to stand trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nA defendant must prove that he is incompetent to stand trial by a â€œpreponderance \r\n  of the evidence.â€Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 39, 503 S.E.2d 747, 749 \r\n  (1998).Â  Holding a criminal defendant to a â€œclear and convincingâ€ burden to \r\n  prove incompetence is a violation of due process.Â  Cooper v. Oklahoma, \r\n  517 U.S. 348, 350, 116 S. Ct. 1373, 1375, 134 L. Ed. 2d 498 (1996).Â  \r\nIn his order, the PCR judge stated \r\n  that Hall failed to establish â€œwith credible and convincing evidenceâ€ that he \r\n  was incompetent to stand trial.Â  Hall argues that â€œcredible and convincingâ€ \r\n  evidence is synonymous with â€œclear and convincingâ€ evidence, which is not the \r\n  appropriate standard of proof for determining a defendantâ€™s competency to stand \r\n  trial.Â  However, after reviewing the order in its entirety, we find that the \r\n  trial judge used the correct burden of proof - a preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  In fact, the PCR judge noted several times that Hall must prove his incompetence \r\n  by a â€œpreponderance of the evidence.â€Â  \r\nFirst, in his order, the \r\n  PCR judge stated that â€œ[i]n a state post-conviction relief hearing, the Applicant \r\n  also bears the burden of proof and he is required to show by a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence that he is entitled to relief.Â  Rule 71.1(e), SCRCP.Â  This Court \r\n  finds that he has failed this burden.â€Â  \r\nSecond, in finding that \r\n  Hall was not prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel, the PCR judge \r\n  stated,Â  â€œHall has a burden of proof at trial to show by a preponderance of \r\n  the evidence that he was incompetent.Â  This Court finds, to a reasonable probability, \r\n  he has failed in his burden.â€Â  \r\nWe note that the PCR judgeâ€™s \r\n  order should have been amended to exclude the â€œcredible and convincingâ€ language, \r\n  alleviating any doubt concerning which standard the PCR judge applied.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  after reviewing the order in its entirety, we find that the judge applied the \r\n  proper standardâ€”preponderance of the evidenceâ€”to determine whether Hall was \r\n  competent to stand trial.\r\nB.Â  Evidence of Petitionerâ€™s Competency to Stand Trial\r\nOn July 16, 1991, three days \r\n  after Hallâ€™s arrest, the trial court ordered Hall to be evaluated for his competency \r\n  to stand trial.Â  A group of doctors at the Hall Institute found Hall to be competent \r\n  to stand trial, with one doctor reporting that Hallâ€™s mental state was a â€œclose \r\n  callâ€ and a â€œtouch and goâ€ issue.Â  Since the 1991 evaluations, the parties have \r\n  accumulated a mass of evidence and engaged in a â€œbattle of the expertsâ€ as to \r\n  Hallâ€™s competency to stand trial.Â  Hall argues that, although he was found competent \r\n  in August 1991, he was not competent during his trial, which took place in January \r\n  1992.Â  We find a sufficient amount of evidence supporting the PCR judgeâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that Hall was competent to stand trial.\r\nConviction of a criminal defendant \r\n  who is not competent to stand trial violates the due process clause of the fourteenth \r\n  amendment.Â  Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375 (1966).Â  This Court has held \r\n  that to be competent to stand trial or continue trial, a defendant must have \r\n  â€œa rational, as well as factual, understanding of the proceedings against himâ€ \r\n  and the â€œability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational \r\n  understanding.â€ State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 395-96, 360 S.E.2d 706, \r\n  708 (1987) (citing Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 402 (1960)).\r\nIf there is â€œany evidence of \r\n  probative value to support the post conviction judgeâ€™s factual findings,â€ we \r\n  must affirm.Â  Cherry, 300 S.C. at 119, 386 S.E.2d at 626.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  if the PCR judge makes an error of law, then this Court must reverse.Â  Pierce \r\n  v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).Â  In addition, the \r\n  PCR judge has the duty to weigh the credibility of the doctors who have testified \r\n  as to Hallâ€™s competency to stand trial.Â  If the testimony supports the PCR judgeâ€™s \r\n  findings, then the findings should be upheld.Â  Solomon v. State, 313 \r\n  S.C. 526, 443 S.E.2d 540 (1994); Wade v. State, 308 S.C. 552, 419 S.E.2d \r\n  781 (1992) (a finding that testimony in support of allegations was unconvincing, \r\n  without credibility, and untruthful will be upheld on appeal).\r\nThis Court has held that the \r\n  PCR judge erred in granting relief on the basis that the defendant was not competent \r\n  to stand trial when (1) counsel testified at the PCR hearing that he had no \r\n  trouble communicating with the defendant; (2) the trial transcript showed that \r\n  the defendant clearly understood the questions asked and responded in an appropriate \r\n  manner; and (3) a forensic psychiatrist evaluated the defendant prior to trial \r\n  and found the defendantâ€™s medical conditions did not affect his mental state.Â  \r\n  McLaughlin v. State, 352 S.C. 476, 575 S.E.2d 841 (2002).Â  \r\nHall presents several arguments \r\n  that he was incompetent to stand trial:Â  (1) he has been diagnosed with an antisocial \r\n  disorder; (2) his trial counsel testified that he believed that Hall was not \r\n  competent during trial; (3) Hall suffered from a seizure the night before sentencing, \r\n  indicating that he could have experienced periods of incompetency; (4) during \r\n  trial, he had taken abnormal doses of Dilantin causing him to be groggy and \r\n  sedated; and (5) his low IQ indicates he has the intelligence of an average \r\n  eleven-year-old. \r\nConversely, the state presents \r\n  a sufficient amount of probative evidence that Hall was competent to stand trial:Â  \r\n  (1) in August 1991, several psychologists conducted an extensive evaluation \r\n  of Hall and found him to be competent to stand trial; (2) Dr. McKee, who evaluated \r\n  Hall from July 23, 1991 to August 8, 1991, found that â€œhis answers to his questions \r\n  were well associated, goal directed and relevant; there was no evidence of delusional \r\n  thinkingâ€ and that he was capable of â€œunderstanding and participating in his \r\n  defense and is capable of understanding the charges against himâ€;Â  (3) one of \r\n  Hallâ€™s defense counsel, Dallas Ball, testified in a May 29, 1997 deposition \r\n  that â€œ[i]n the discussions with Mr. Hall throughout the caseâ€¦[Hall] understood \r\n  what he was facing, and he listened to the testimony each day as to what was \r\n  said against him, and he understood what was going onâ€; (4)Â  during the PCR \r\n  hearing, defense counsel, Christopher Olson (Olson), testified that Hall told \r\n  him that he shot the other girl because she was an eyewitness to the first shooting, \r\n  indicating that Hall knew the consequences of his actions; and (5) Olson also \r\n  testified that none of the doctors indicated any need to reevaluate Hall before \r\n  trial. \r\nWe find that a sufficient amount \r\n  of probative evidence exists to support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling that Hall was \r\n  competent to stand trial.Â  Moreover, given that the PCR applied the correct \r\n  burden of proof, we hold that the PCR judge correctly determined that Hall was \r\n  competent to stand trial.\r\nII.Â  Closing Argument\r\nHall argues that trial counsel \r\n  was ineffective because counsel failed to object when the solicitor made the \r\n  following statement in his closing argument:\r\n\r\n  I am talking about values, because a jury verdict is a statement of values.Â  \r\n    And I am not talking about dollars and cents as far as what the [lives of \r\n    the two girls were] worth, but nevertheless it is a question of values.Â  What \r\n    are the lives of these two girls worth?Â  Are they worth the life of this man, \r\n    the psychopath, this killer who stabs and stabs and kills, and rapes and kidnaps.\r\n\r\nHall argues that his trial counselâ€™s \r\n  failure to object allowed the solicitor to charge the jury with an arbitrary, \r\n  misconceived sentencing analysis, violating Hallâ€™s right to due process.Â  We \r\n  agree. \r\nA criminal defendant is constitutionally \r\n  entitled to effective representation.Â  Rogers v. State, 261 S.C. 288, \r\n  199 S.E.2d 761 (1973).Â  In order to find trial counsel ineffective, this Court \r\n  must find that counselâ€™s conduct was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced \r\n  the outcome of the trial.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). \r\n\r\nIn the past, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court (USSC) did not explicitly recognize the stateâ€™s right to offer \r\n  victim impact evidence in a criminal trial.Â  In Booth v. Maryland, the \r\n  USSC â€œleft open the possibility that the kind of information contained in victim \r\n  impact statements could be admissible if it â€˜related directly to the circumstances \r\n  of the crime.â€™â€ 482 U.S. 496, 507 (1987)).Â  Additionally, in South Carolina \r\n  v. Gathers, the USSC affirmed this Courtâ€™s ruling that â€œvictim impact statements \r\n  in capital sentencing proceeds violate [the] principle that a sentence of death \r\n  must be related to the moral culpability of the defendant.â€Â  490 U.S. 805, 810 \r\n  (1989).Â  \r\nBut in 1991, the USSC overruled \r\n  Gathers and Booth, holding:\r\n\r\n  if the State chooses to permit the admission of victim impact evidence and \r\n    prosecutorial argument on that subject, the Eighth Amendment erects no per \r\n    se bar.Â  A state may legitimately conclude that evidence about the victim \r\n    and about the impact of the murder on the victimâ€™s family is relevant to the \r\n    juryâ€™s decision as to whether or not the death penalty should be imposed.Â  \r\n    There is no reason to treat such evidence differently than any other relevant \r\n    evidence is treated.\r\n\r\nPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991).\r\nIn other words, â€œ[v]ictim impact \r\n  evidence, as any other relevant evidence, is admissible so long as it is not \r\n  so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfairâ€¦.â€ Id.Â  \r\n  However, â€œ[a]s a general matter, â€¦ victim impact evidence is not offered \r\n  to encourage comparative judgments of this kindâ€”for instance, that the killer \r\n  of a hardworking, devoted parent deserves the death penalty, but that the murderer \r\n  of a reprobate does not.â€ Id. at 823, 111 S. Ct. at 2607 (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  Under a similar line of reasoning, this Court held that a criminal defendantâ€™s \r\n  reprehensibility was not mitigated by the fact that the victim was a murderer \r\n  himself.Â  State v. Gaskins, 284 S.C. 105, 326 S.E.2d 132 (1985).\r\nAt first glance, our decision in Humphries v. \r\n  State appears to allow a solicitor to compare the lives of a criminal defendant \r\n  with that of the defendantâ€™s victim.Â  351 S.C. 362, 376, 570 S.E.2d 160, 168 \r\n  (2002).Â  Nonetheless, we do not extend Humphries to permit the state \r\n  to encourage the jury to compare the worth of a defendantâ€™s life with that of \r\n  his victims. In Humphries, we upheld Humphriesâ€™s death sentence and held \r\n  that the solicitorâ€™s comparison of the lives of Humphries and his victim was \r\n  within the realm of permissible victim impact evidence.Â  In Humphries, \r\n  defense counsel, attempting to mitigate the effects of the stateâ€™s evidence \r\n  concerning the brutality of the murder, elicited testimony that Humphries was \r\n  a victim of parental abuse, substance abuse, and poverty as a child. \r\n  [3]  Â Â \r\nIn his closing argument, the solicitor responded \r\n  by comparing the lives of Humphries and his victim.Â  Although both Humphries \r\n  and his victim were reared in impoverished conditions, Humphries was in and \r\n  out of jail while the victim maintained an ordinary, crime-free life.Â  We held \r\n  that the solicitorâ€™s argument was permissible victim impact evidence.  \r\n  [4] Â  \r\nAgain, the solicitorâ€™s argument in Hallâ€™s trial \r\n  is distinguishable from the solicitorâ€™s argument in Humphries.Â  \r\nIn Humphries we recognized that it is more prejudicial for the state \r\n  to compare the worth of the life of the defendant with that of his victim than \r\n  it is to compare their lives based on the evidence presented.Â  Id. at \r\n  374, 570 S.E.2d at 167-168.Â  In the present case, the solicitor not only suggested \r\n  that Hallâ€™s life was worth less than his victimsâ€™, he developed an arbitrary \r\n  formula whereby if the jury finds Hallâ€™s life worth less than his victimsâ€™, \r\n  then the jury could reach no other conclusion than that the death penalty is \r\n  justified.Â  \r\nFurther, while the solicitor in Humphries compared the histories \r\n  of Humphriesâ€™s and his victimâ€™s lives, the solicitor in Hall asked the \r\n  jury to compare the worth of Hallâ€™s life with that of his victimsâ€™. \r\n\r\nWe hold that the solicitor impermissibly compared \r\n  Hallâ€™s life to the victimsâ€™ lives.Â  We find that the solicitorâ€™s comparison \r\n  (1) was so emotionally inflammatory that it became a material part of the juryâ€™s \r\n  deliberation process;Â  (2) unquestionably directed the jurors to conduct an \r\n  arbitrary balancing of worth, which required that Hall be sentenced to death \r\n  if the jury found Hallâ€™s life was worth less than the lives of his victims; \r\n  (3) is totally unrelated to the circumstances of the crime; and (4) is distinguishable \r\n  from traditional impact evidence in that it was not actually offered to show \r\n  the impact of the crime on the victims or the victimsâ€™ family.Â  \r\nFor these reasons, we hold that Hall was denied his constitutional right to \r\n  effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to object to the \r\n  solicitorâ€™s comparison between the worth of Hallâ€™s life and the lives of the \r\n  victims.\r\nIII.Â  Adoption of the Stateâ€™s Proposed Order in Full\r\nHall argues that the PCR judge erred in adopting \r\n  the stateâ€™s proposed order because the order did not resolve issues of fact, \r\n  indicating that the judge did not render an independent judicial judgment.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe commentary to South Carolina Appellate Court Rule 501, Canon 3 B(7)(e) \r\n  provides that â€œ[a] judge may request a party to submit proposed findings of \r\n  fact and conclusions of law, so long as the other parties are apprised of the \r\n  request and are given an opportunity to respond to the proposed findings and \r\n  conclusions.â€Â  Further, in Pruitt v. State, this Court directed that:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [c]ounsel preparing a proposed order should be meticulous in doing so, opposing \r\n    counsel should call any omissions to the attention of the PCR judge prior \r\n    to issuance of the order, and the PCR judge should carefully review the order \r\n    prior to signing it.Â  Moreover, after an order is filed, counsel has an obligation \r\n    to review the order and file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend \r\n    if the order fails to set forth the findings and the reasons for those findings \r\n    as required by Â§ 17-27-80 and Rule 52(a), SCRCPâ€¦.\r\n\r\n310 S.C. 254, 256, 423 S.E.2d 127, 128 (1992).\r\nOn November 12, 1999, after receiving a request from the PCR judge to do so, \r\n  the state submitted a proposed order to both the judge and opposing counsel.Â  \r\n  On November 14, 1999, the PCR judge told the parties that he would â€œcarefully \r\n  review the proposed order and insure that the facts and conclusions of law are \r\n  as I find them to be.â€Â  \r\nAlthough we strongly encourage PCR judges to draft their own findings of fact \r\n  and conclusions of law in death penalty cases, we also acknowledge that in all \r\n  other cases, it is common practice for judges to ask a party to draft a proposed \r\n  order for the sake of efficiency.Â  In the present case, the evidence sufficiently \r\n  indicates that the PCR judge spent an adequate amount of time reviewing the \r\n  order before adopting it.Â  Further, Hall waived his right to make this challenge \r\n  when he failed to file a motion to alter or amend the order. Id.Â \r\nConclusion\r\nWe REVERSE the PCR court on the basis that Hallâ€™s \r\n  counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, \r\n  which included an instruction to the jury to compare the worth of Hallâ€™s life \r\n  with the lives of his victims. Accordingly, we REMAND for a new sentencing proceeding.Â  \r\n  Finally, we affirm the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling on the remaining issues.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Dr. James Brice, Hallâ€™s family physician, saw Hall shortly after \r\n    the court hearing.Â  Dr. Brice ordered blood tests, which revealed that Hallâ€™s \r\n    Dilantin level was 39.Â  The normal therapeutic range is 10-20.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]  An EEG (electroencephalograph) \r\n    monitors the electric impulses of the brain, allowing doctors to detect and \r\n    diagnose brain dysfunction.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Humphries presented thirteen witnesses who testified as to his cruel \r\n    childhood.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [4]  We recognize that the \r\n    Fourth Circuit recently granted Humphries federal habeas corpus, finding that \r\n    the state (1) compared the worth of Humphriesâ€™s life with that of his \r\n    victim and (2) did so for the primary purpose of â€œexhort[ing] the jury to \r\n    return a death sentence on the basis of the [defendantâ€™s] relative lack of \r\n    worth.â€Â  Humphries v. Ozmint, 2004 WL 937266 at 4 (4th Cir. \r\n    May 3, 2004).Â  We also take notice that the Fourth Circuit granted the stateâ€™s \r\n    petition for rehearing en banc and will rehear the case in October \r\n    2004.Â  Nevertheless, we disagree that the victim-defendant comparison found \r\n    in our account of Humphries is as prejudicial as the comparison in \r\n    the present case.Â  We continue to distinguish the facts of Humphries \r\n    with that of the present case and maintain that these factual differences \r\n    yield a different result as a matter of law.Â  Our interpretation of the law \r\n    coincides most congruently with Senior Judge Hamiltonâ€™s dissent in the Fourth \r\n    Circuitâ€™s recent account of Humphries:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [A]llowing the introduction of victim-impact evidence does not, \r\n    and should not, open the door to evidence/argument ultimately allowing the \r\n    jury to make a comparative inquiry between the victim and other victims in \r\n    society, as the court in Payne apparently recognized.\r\n  â€¦\r\n  Put simply, clearly established Supreme Court precedent does not \r\n    prohibit victim-to-defendant comparisons; they are inevitable in any capital \r\n    case in which the jury is asked to assess the persuasive force of the defendantâ€™s \r\n    mitigating evidence and the victim-impact evidence. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Id. at 18.Â  \r\n  We recognize that those victim-to-defendant comparisons that render a trial \r\n    fundamentally unfair and those victim-to-defendant comparisons that are permissible \r\n    are not always clearly distinguishable.Â  A comparison that constitutes permissible \r\n    victim-impact evidence is not as prejudicial to a defendant as a comparison \r\n    that imposes, what in effect is, an arbitrary, unfounded jury charge.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25851","title":"Collins Holding Corporation v.

[1] Â  After a bench trial, the judge awarded Collins \r\n  $244,450.56 in damages.Â  Both Collins and Appellant moved to alter or amend \r\n  the order.Â  The judge denied the motions.Â  Appellant appealed.Â  This appeal \r\n  was certified from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 21, 2000, Appellant \r\n  and Collins signed a contract that gave Collins â€œthe exclusive right for six \r\n  years to install and maintain all coin and/or currency operated Flipper Machines, \r\n  and Pinball Machines, upon the entire premises of [three convenience stores \r\n  owned by Appellant].â€Â  The contract also stated that Appellant had the right \r\n  to have the machines removed with 10 days written notice to Collins.Â  The revenue \r\n  was to be divided 40% to Appellant and 60% to Collins.Â  The contract stated \r\n  â€œ[d]uring the term and any continuation thereof, no other person, firm, corporation \r\n  or entity of any kind whatsoever shall have the right to operate any [] coin \r\n  and/or currency operated flipper machines and pinball machines, upon said premises.â€Â  \r\n  Finally, the contract also stated â€œ[a]ny prior statements, offers, representations \r\n  or understandings are deemed matters of negotiation only and are merged into \r\n  this Agreement which is a complete integration of the Agreement and contains \r\n  only the Agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter described \r\n  herein.Â  [Appellant] further certifies that there are no contracts or agreements \r\n  with any other party regarding the subject matter herein.Â  This Agreement may \r\n  only be modified by a written instrument signed by all the parties hereto.â€Â  \r\n  Both parties, as well as two witnesses, signed the agreement.Â  \r\nThe judge found that Appellant became dissatisfied with the 60/40 split of \r\n  revenues and demanded a 50/50 split, which Collins refused.Â  After the refusal, \r\n  Appellant disconnected Collinsâ€™ machines and installed his own machines, as \r\n  well as machines owned by Sonco Amusements, Inc. (Sonco). Sonco split the revenues \r\n  50/50 with Appellant. The judge found that Appellant breached the contract with \r\n  Collins and awarded Collins $244,450.56 in damages as well as the costs of the \r\n  action.Â  \r\n ISSUES\r\n1.Â  Did the trial court err in awarding Collins damages for breach of contract \r\n  because the damages were too speculative?\r\n2.Â  Did the trial court err in not awarding Appellant damages for breach of \r\n  contract?\r\nANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Speculative Damages\r\nAppellant argues that the trial judge erred in awarding Collins damages because \r\n  any damages are speculative.Â  We disagree.Â  The trial judge based his award \r\n  of damages on the testimony of Jerry Alex Saad (Saad), a Certified Public Accountant, \r\n  who had previously been the Chief Financial Officer for Collins Entertainment \r\n  for 8 years.Â  Saad testified that the damages suffered by Collins in this case \r\n  were $244,450.56.Â  Saad reached this figure by taking the actual weekly revenues \r\n  received from each location owned by Appellant for the period of time that the \r\n  machines were in Appellantâ€™s stores. He took a weekly average using that figure \r\n  and multiplied that average by the number of weeks remaining in the term of \r\n  that locationâ€™s contract.Â  \r\nAppellant argues that the \r\n  damages are speculative. He argues that because he exercised the contract provision \r\n  that allowed the machines to be removed after 10 days written notice, there \r\n  would be no revenue, and therefore no damages.Â  Although Appellant is correct \r\n  that the contract allowed the machines to be removed with 10 days written notice, \r\n  he is incorrect in his assertion that this clause affects the damages.Â  The \r\n  breach of contract occurred when Appellant placed â€œforeignâ€ machines, which \r\n  were not owned by Collins, in the stores.Â  According to the contract, Collins \r\n  had the exclusive right to provide flipper machines in the stores for 6 years.Â  \r\n\r\nIn a breach of contract \r\n  action, the â€œmeasure of damages is the loss actually suffered by the contractee \r\n  as the result of the breach. And profits that have been prevented or lost as \r\n  the natural consequence of a breach of contract are recoverable as an item of \r\n  damages in an action for such breach.â€Â  South Carolina Finance Corp. of Anderson \r\n  v. West Side Finance Comp., 236 S.C. 109, 114, 113 S.E.2d 329, 335-36 (1960).Â  \r\n  Saad testified about the formula used to calculate the estimated damages, and \r\n  the formula is reasonable.Â  â€œThe law does not require absolute certainty of \r\n  data upon which lost profits are to be estimated, but all that is required is \r\n  such reasonable certainty that damages may not be based wholly upon speculation \r\n  or conjecture, and it is sufficient if there is a certain standard or fixed \r\n  method by which profits sought to be recovered may be estimated and determined \r\n  with a fair degree of accuracy.â€Â  113 S.E.2d at 336.Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  award of $244,450.56 for Appellantâ€™s breach of contract.Â  \r\n2.Â  Appellantâ€™s Damages\r\nAppellant alleges that the machines were not removed 10 days after he gave \r\n  Collins written notice, and therefore Collins breached the contract.Â  Appellant \r\n  contends the trial court erred in not awarding him damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellant testified he notified Collins that he wanted the machines removed \r\n  but Collins did not remove the machines until 6 months after notification.Â  \r\n  Appellant testified that he was forced to store the machines for this period \r\n  and that he could have used the area for storage. Appellant figured his damages \r\n  at $10 a day for 6 months, which is $3,600.Â  The judge found that Appellant \r\n  failed to prove his claim by the greater weight of the evidence and did not \r\n  award Appellant damages.Â  We affirm the trial judge.Â  Appellant was unable to \r\n  locate a copy of the letter that he sent to Collins.Â  Further, Appellant did \r\n  not offer any evidence to prove damages, except that he â€œcould have had merchandise \r\n  there overstocked.â€Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nMOORE and WALLER., JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part in a separate opinion in which Acting Justice Aphrodite K. Konduros, \r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I agree with the majorityâ€™s holding that the damage \r\n  award in favor of Collins was not speculative, but I disagree with the majorityâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that the Appellant did not satisfy his burden of proving that Collins \r\n  breached the contract causing Appellant to suffer damages.Â  Therefore, I respectfully \r\n  dissent in part.\r\nThe contract between Appellant and Collins provided that the Appellant had \r\n  â€œthe right to have said machines removed within (10) ten days written notice \r\n  toâ€ Collins.Â  While Appellant may have been unable to include in the record \r\n  the letters he sent to Collins giving the ten day notice, [2]  Collins testified about the contents of two notice letters \r\n  on cross-examination: \r\n \r\n  Appellant: Mr. Collins, I want to show you two letters â€¦ [y]ou are welcome \r\n    to read them into the record, should you elect to, sir.\r\n  Collins: This is July the 31st, 2001.Â  And itâ€™s a letter from \r\n    [Appellantâ€™s attorney] to [Collinsâ€™ attorney].\r\n  â€œDear [Collinsâ€™ attorney], Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to review your July 24th, \r\n    2001, correspondence regarding the above-referenced store and related contract.Â  \r\n    Pursuant to the specific terms of the contract, [Appellant] would respectfully \r\n    request that [Collins] remove its machines from all relevant locations within \r\n    10 days of the date of this letter.â€\r\n  â€¦\r\n  Appellant: Now under the terms of this contract, does that count as notice \r\n    --\r\n  Collins: That would be notice, yes, sir.\r\n  â€¦\r\n  Appellant: All right sir.Â  And the second one, does it essentially ask for \r\n    the --\r\n  Collins: This is August the 31st, 2001.\r\n  â€¦\r\n  â€œDear [Collinsâ€™ attorney], I received your recent letter regarding the above-referenced \r\n    matter.Â  To date, your client has not removed the machines as contemplated \r\n    under the contract.Â  Please be advised that your client has 10 days from the \r\n    date of this letter to remove the machines or they will simply be placed at \r\n    curbside for appropriate removal.â€\r\n  â€¦\r\n  Appellant: So you did get notice; right?\r\n  Collins: My lawyer did, yes, sir.Â  And essentially, I got the notice because \r\n    he was representing me.\r\n\r\nIn my view, this testimony on cross-examination \r\n  clearly indicates that Collins received the requisite notice of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  contractual right to have the machines removed.Â  That evidence, combined with \r\n  Appellantâ€™s testimony of his inventory carrying cost -- a normal business expense \r\n  -- clearly satisfies Appellantâ€™s burden to prove both breach and damages.Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would find that the trial judge erred in not awarding Appellant \r\n  damages in the amount of $3,600 [3]  resulting from Collinsâ€™ failure to remove the \r\n  machines.Â Â  \r\nActing Justice Aphrodite K.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25853\r\n  Submitted April 21, 2004 - Filed August 9, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        John William Ray, of Greenville, for Petitioner.\r\n        Lottie Fleming and Frederick Fleming, of Greenville, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  We granted certiorari to determine whether \r\n  the court of appeals erred in affirming judgment for Lottie Fleming and Frederick \r\n  Fleming (Flemings), holding that a verified statement of account (VSA) included \r\n  in a request for default judgment cannot be signed by the attorney of record.Â  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn 1994, John William Ray \r\n  (Ray) began representing petitioner BB&amp;T in its collection matters on a \r\n  large scale.Â  Regardless of whether BB&amp;T sues a defaulted obligor, the obligorâ€™s \r\n  file remains in Rayâ€™s custody throughout the collection process.Â Â  Upon initiating \r\n  litigation against a defaulted obligor, Ray has developed a practice of attaching \r\n  a self-signed VSA, among other associated documents, to complaints.Â  In addition, \r\n  Ray has made practice of attaching a self-signed affidavit of the liquidated \r\n  sum certain along with interest and costs pursuant to Rule 55(b), SCRCP.Â  \r\nFrom 1994 until 2000, Rayâ€™s practice of signing \r\n  the VSAs himself went unchallenged but in early 2000, in Greenville County, \r\n  BB&amp;Tâ€™s requests for default judgment began to be denied.Â  At that same time, \r\n  the trial judge [1]  wrote Ray \r\n  and explained that the requests were being denied because VSAs â€œshould be signed \r\n  by [the] plaintiff,â€ not counsel.Â  In addition, the trial judgeâ€™s law clerk \r\n  wrote Ray a letter, explaining that Ray should not sign the VSAs because by \r\n  signing the VSAs, Ray was attesting â€œas a fact witnessâ€”which runs counter to \r\n  Rule 3.7.â€ [2] Â Â  \r\nIn response, Ray wrote the trial judge on two separate \r\n  occasions explaining that he was in the best position to sign the VSAs because \r\n  he was essentially the records custodian for BB&amp;T.Â  The trial judge replied \r\n  to one of Rayâ€™s letters by writing:\r\n\r\n  Everyday I sign orders for numerous collection attorneys from around the \r\n    stateâ€”None of those sign verifying the amount due.Â  You cannot do that as \r\n    an attorney in this case.Â  You are the only lawyer attempting to do thatâ€”Iâ€™m \r\n    sure that this is improper.Â  It is contrary to the law.Â  You cannot be a witness \r\n    in the case.Â  You present evidence.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge also wrote a letter to the Greenville County Clerk of Court, \r\n  which intercepted a letter that Ray wrote to the clerk stating:Â  â€œMr. Ray refuses \r\n  to handle his collection the way other attorneys do.Â  He cannot be a witness \r\n  and certify damages.Â  If he has the bank certify the amount due I will sign \r\n  the order.Â  If another Judge wants to sign it, fine.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSubsequently, Ray wrote a letter to Judge Kittredgeâ€™s law \r\n  clerk to check the status of several proposed default orders that Ray had sent \r\n  for Judge Kittredgeâ€™s approval.Â  Judge Patterson responded to the letter:\r\n \r\n  I am sorry that I am late in responding to your letter to Judge Kittredge, \r\n    but, as you know, I have relayed to you my opinion on this matter.\r\n  Rule 11 permits signing of pleadings by attorneys.Â  Specifically, SCRCP 9(i) \r\n    provides for verification of account.Â  The Rule specifically states that the \r\n    pleader shall attach a verified copy of the account to the pleading.Â  It was \r\n    added to the South Carolina Rules to preserve prior practice.Â  These rules \r\n    never intended for an attorney to verify pleadings or accounts.Â  Further, \r\n    there is case law to the effect that an account based on information and belief \r\n    does not constitute proof sufficient to enter judgment for liquidated damages.Â  \r\n    Rule 11(c) provides that when a corporation is a party the verification may \r\n    be made by any officer or agent thereof.Â  \r\n  I have signed several hundred default judgments this year.Â  You are the only \r\n    attorney who does not have an officer or agent verify the amount of the loan, \r\n    the amount paid, and the balance due.\r\n  Your files are becoming dormant, and in fairness, I shall set them before \r\n    me for a hearing, make a record, and permit you to appeal my ruling.\r\n\r\nThe letter was carbon-copied to Judges Few, Floyd, Kittredge, Watson, Cole, \r\n  and Non-jury Coordinator, Carole C. Hopkins.\r\nNearly a year later, the trial judgeâ€”before conducting a hearingâ€”issued an \r\n  order addressing five collection actions filed by Ray, including the Flemingsâ€™ \r\n  case.Â Â  In his order, the trial judge (1) refused to enter default judgment \r\n  in all cases where Ray signed the VSA and (2) imposed a proactive $100 fine \r\n  sua sponte against Ray for every future VSA that he signed and submitted \r\n  to the court.Â  \r\nThe court of appeals affirmed, holding that (1) the issue of whether Rayâ€™s \r\n  self-signed VSAs were legitimate was not preserved for review, and (2) the issue \r\n  concerning the trial judgeâ€™s proactive fines was not ripe for review.Â  BB&amp;T \r\n  raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in holding that the issue \r\n      of whether the trial judge properly refused to enter a default judgment \r\n      was not preserved for review?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in holding that the issue \r\n      concerning proactive sanctions was not ripe for review? \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â  Refusal to Enter Default Judgment\r\nThe court of appeals held that BB&amp;T did not properly preserve \r\n  the issue of whether the trial judge erred in refusing to enter a default judgment \r\n  because the issue was â€œnot raised to the circuit court and [is] not addressed \r\n  in the order.â€ BB&amp;T of South Carolina v. Lottie Fleming and Frederick \r\n  Fleming, Op. No. 03-UP-255 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 8, 2003).Â  BB&amp;T \r\n  argues that the court of appeals erred in ruling that the issue was not properly \r\n  preserved for review.Â  BB&amp;T further argues that the court of appeals should \r\n  have reversed the trial judgeâ€™s ruling denying BB&amp;T default judgment.Â  We \r\n  agree.\r\nIn early October 2000, the trial judge wrote Ray a letter explaining that he \r\n  intended to conduct a hearing and create a record so that the VSA issue would \r\n  be preserved for review, but a hearing never took place.Â  In addition, the record \r\n  reveals that BB&amp;T offered to prepare a record and an order to the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s specification.Â  Nevertheless, the trial judge rejected BB&amp;Tâ€™s proposals \r\n  and failed to address the VSA issue in the order despite BB&amp;Tâ€™s efforts \r\n  to have the issue placed on the record.Â  As a result, BB&amp;T could not create \r\n  a record and preserve the issue for review.Â  Given that BB&amp;T took the proper \r\n  steps to preserve the issue, and was unsuccessful only because of the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s lack of cooperation, we hold that the VSA issue is properly preserved \r\n  for appellate review and will address the issue accordingly.\r\nTwo rules apply to the VSA issue presented in this case:Â  \r\n  Rule 9(i), SCRCP, Verification of Account and Rule 11(c), SCRCP, Affidavits \r\n  and Verifications.\r\n\r\n  Rule 9(i), SCRCP, provides:\r\n  Verification of Account.Â  In an action on an account the pleader shall \r\n    attach a verified copy of the account to the pleading, or if the items of \r\n    the account are set forth in the pleading, it must be verified.\r\n  Rule 11(c), SCRCP, provides:\r\n  Affidavits and Verifications.Â  Affidavits or verifications authorized \r\n    or permitted under these Rules shall be written statements or declarations \r\n    by a party or his attorney of record or of a witness, sworn to or affirmed \r\n    before an officer authorized to administer oaths, that the affiant knows the \r\n    facts stated to be true of his own knowledge, except as to those matters stated \r\n    on information and belief and as to those matters that he believes them to \r\n    be true.Â  When a corporation is a party the verifications may be made by any \r\n    officer or agent thereofâ€¦.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn the present case, Ray is the attorney of record, and as \r\n  such, he is also an agent of BB&amp;T.Â  Ray has also shown that he is in the \r\n  best position to sign VSAs for BB&amp;T because he is the custodian of BB&amp;Tâ€™s \r\n  obligor files. Accordingly, we hold that Rule 11(c) allows an attorney of record \r\n  to sign VSAs in connection with debt collection proceedings. Further, we find \r\n  that the trial judgeâ€™s grounds for denying judgment were based upon a misinterpretation \r\n  of the law and that default judgment should have been entered as requested.\r\nWe find that the court of appeals erred in holding that BB&amp;T \r\n  did not properly preserve the issue of whether BB&amp;Tâ€™s counsel may sign a \r\n  VSA.Â  In addition, according to the plain meaning of Rule 11(c), default judgment \r\n  should have been entered in favor of BB&amp;T in its suit against the Flemings.\r\nII.Â  Sanctions\r\nBB&amp;T argues that the court of appeals erred in affirming \r\n  the $100 proactive fine imposed by the trial judge.Â  Because the grounds for \r\n  the fines were based upon a misinterpretation of law, we hold that the sanctions \r\n  are void.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe reverse the court of appeals ruling, which upholds the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of entry of judgment based upon a misinterpretation of Rule 11(c), SCRCP.Â  We \r\n  also vacate the order as to sanctions against Ray and instruct the trial court \r\n  to enter judgment in favor of BB&amp;T.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Judge Patterson was the trial judge in the majority of the suits \r\n    involved in this appeal.Â  He was the first judge to deny Rayâ€™s requests for \r\n    default on the ground that the VSAs were â€œdefective.â€Â  As Chief Administrative \r\n    Judge of the thirteenth circuit, Judge Patterson also instructed the other \r\n    thirteenth circuit judges to deny all of Rayâ€™s requests for judgment that \r\n    included â€œdefectiveâ€ VSAs. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Rule 3.7 of the Rules \r\n    of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR provides that an attorney may not \r\n    participate in a case if that attorney is likely to be a â€œnecessary witness.â€Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Thomas E.

Â§ 12-37-223A (Supp. 2003).Â  In November 2000, County adopted Ordinance \r\n  1163 (Ordinance), purportedly pursuant to the Enabling Act.Â  The Ordinance capped \r\n  the valuation increase on owner-occupied primary residences at 15%, but provided \r\n  no relief for other properties. [2] \r\nThe â€œproperty tax assessmentâ€\r\n(PTA) for each parcel of taxable real estate in a county is determined by\r\nmultiplying the propertyâ€™s fair market value or special use value by the appropriate assessment ratio, that is, 4% for owner-occupied \r\n  residences and 6% for other properties.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-30(19) (2000 \r\n  and Supp. 2003).Â  This PTA figure is then multiplied by the taxing districtâ€™s [3]  millage rate, resulting in the tax assessment, that is, the \r\n  dollar amount owed by the taxpayer for that year. [4] Â  The millage is determined by dividing the \r\n  value of all taxable property located within a taxing districtâ€™s boundaries \r\n  by the districtâ€™s annual budget. [5] \r\nThe effect of the Ordinance in tax year 2001 was \r\n  to reduce the fair market value of many owner-occupied residences.Â  As the result \r\n  of the Ordinanceâ€™s reduction of the total value of taxable real property in \r\n  the County, the millage rate for all taxing districts was higher than it would \r\n  have been had all property been fully valued.Â  All County taxpayers in 2001 \r\n  were affected by the higher millage although taxpayers who benefited from the \r\n  Ordinanceâ€™s cap ultimately received a tax bill for an amount less than they \r\n  would have received had the cap not been imposed. The impact of the Ordinance \r\n  in tax year 2001 was to shift approximately $9.83 million of the tax burden \r\n  primarily to owners of non-owner-occupied primary residences.\r\nFollowing the adoption of the Ordinance, but prior to the date \r\n  2001 property taxes were due, certain county taxpayers (Riverwoods plaintiffs) \r\n  brought an action challenging the legality of the Ordinance.Â  The Riverwoods \r\n  plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment striking down the Ordinance and also \r\n  sought an injunction.Â  The trial judge found the Ordinance invalid, but declined \r\n  â€œto issue injunctive relief of any sort that would constitute affirmative judicial \r\n  interference with the Countyâ€™s taxing processesâ€¦Â  Whether the County chooses \r\n  on its own to take any remedial action in light of this Courtâ€™s decision is \r\n  up to it.â€Â  Riverwoods circuit court order.\r\nCounty appealed the Riverwoods order to the extent it struck \r\n  down the Ordinance, and the Riverwoods plaintiffs cross-appealed the \r\n  denial of injunctive relief.Â  On appeal, the Court held the Ordinance invalid \r\n  because it violated the terms of the Enabling Act which did not permit the 15% \r\n  cap to be limited to owner-occupied primary residences.Â  Riverwoods, LLC \r\n  v. County of Charleston, 349 S.C. 378, 563 S.E.2d 651 (2002).Â  In affirming \r\n  the Riverwoods plaintiffsâ€™ appeal from the denial of the injunction, \r\n  we held that they had an adequate legal remedy in that they could pay their \r\n  2001 ad valorem property taxes â€œunder protestâ€ [6]  and cited S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-2550 (2000). [7] \r\nAfter the circuit court filed its order in Riverwoods striking \r\n  down the Ordinance, five taxpayers paid their 2001 real property taxes â€œunder \r\n  protestâ€ and virtually simultaneously filed a civil action seeking a declaratory \r\n  judgment that the Ordinance was invalid and seeking a refund.Â  This suit, and \r\n  ensuing cross-appeals, is resolved by our opinion in the companion case to the \r\n  present controversy.Â  See Hoefer Family Ltd. Partnership v. County \r\n  of Charleston, Op. No. 25856 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 16, 2004) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. 32).\r\nThe Taxpayers in this case timely paid their 2001 real property taxes; \r\n  following our decision in Riverwoods declaring the Ordinance invalid, \r\n  they initiated this circuit court action seeking certification of a taxpayer \r\n  class and refunds for all class members.Â  The circuit court certified a class \r\n  and ordered refunds; in so doing, it refused Countyâ€™s request that the action \r\n  be dismissed in order for Taxpayers to exhaust their administrative remedies.Â  \r\n  Both Taxpayers and County have appealed numerous issues.Â  We find it necessary \r\n  to address only the issue whether Taxpayers were required to exhaust their administrative \r\n  remedies rather than bring this direct refund suit in circuit court.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas the circuit court obligated to dismiss this suit for \r\n  a refund because Taxpayers had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn 1995 the General Assembly adopted the South Carolina \r\n  Revenue Procedures Act [8]  (the \r\n  Act) â€œto provide the people of this State with a straight forward procedure \r\n  to determine any disputed revenue liability.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-20 (2000). \r\n  [9] Â  Section 12-60-80 (Supp. 2003) of the Act provides: [10]  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 12-60-80.Â  Wrongful collection of taxes; declaratory judgment; class action \r\n  prohibited.\r\n(A) Except as provided in subsection (B), there is no remedy other than those \r\n  provided in this chapter in any case involving the illegal or wrongful collection \r\n  of taxes, or attempt to collect taxes.\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\n(B) Notwithstanding subsection (A), an action for a declaratory judgment where \r\n  the sole issue is whether a statute is constitutional may be brought in circuit \r\n  court.Â  This exception does not include a claim that the statute is unconstitutional \r\n  as applied to a person or a limited class or classes of persons.\r\n(C) Notwithstanding subsections (A) and (B), a claim or action for the refund \r\n  of taxes may not be brought as a class action in the Administrative Law Judge \r\n  Division or any court of law in this State, and the department, political subdivisions, \r\n  or their instrumentalities may not be named or made a defendant in any other \r\n  class action brought in this State.\r\n\r\nIf a taxpayer brings a circuit \r\n  court action when she should have pursued administrative remedies under the \r\n  Act, the circuit court â€œshall dismiss the case without prejudice.â€Â  Â§ 12-60-3390 \r\n  (2000 and Supp. 2003).Â  County contends the circuit court erred in refusing \r\n  to dismiss Taxpayersâ€™ direct refund suit without prejudice under this statute \r\n  since Taxpayers were required to first pursue administrative remedies under \r\n  the Act.Â  We agree.\r\nThe circuit court reviewed \r\n  our decision in Riverwoods, supra, which indicated that the remedy \r\n  for taxpayers aggrieved by the Ordinance was found in Â§ 12-60-2550.Â  The circuit \r\n  court held that Taxpayers were not obligated to pursue this administrative remedy \r\n  since their objection did not challenge their Property Tax Assessment (PTA), \r\n  which is the only type of property tax protest contemplated by this statute.Â  \r\n  The circuit court went on to hold that Taxpayers had no remedy under the Act \r\n  because the court concluded that the Act did not provide a procedure for any \r\n  type of challenge other than to the PTA.Â  As explained below, we agree that \r\n  Â§ 12-60-2550 is not applicable to these Taxpayers, but conclude the circuit \r\n  court erred in concluding they had no administrative remedy under the Act. \r\nThe Act contains detailed procedures for a taxpayer who wishes \r\n  to challenge the countyâ€™s determination of her propertyâ€™s PTA , that is, the \r\n  fair market value, the special use value, or the assessment ratio, the components \r\n  of the PTA.Â  Â§ 12-60-30(19).Â  Under the statutory scheme, most PTA appeals are \r\n  initiated and resolved well before the taxes are due.Â  The procedures found \r\n  in article 9 of the Act apply to all PTA appeals. Â§12-60-1710 (2000).Â  In years \r\n  where there has been a countywide reassessment, notice of the new valuations \r\n  must be mailed to property owners by February 1. [11] Â  Â§12-60-2510 (2000 and Supp. 2003).Â  In other years, the assessor \r\n  must give notice by July 1 to owners whose property values have been increased \r\n  by $1,000 or more.Â  Id.Â  The property owner has 30 \r\n  [12]  days to give the assessor written notice if she objects to one or \r\n  more of the PTA components.Â  Â§ 12-60-2510(3).Â  A written request for a meeting \r\n  with the assessor is the equivalent of notice that the taxpayer objects to the \r\n  PTA.Â  Â§ 12-60-2520(A).Â  If, after reviewing the written objection, the assessor \r\n  agrees with the property owner, the assessor must correct the error.Â  Â§ 12-60-2520(B).Â  \r\n  If she does not agree, then she must schedule a meeting.Â  If the issue is not \r\n  resolved at the meeting, then the assessor must give the taxpayer protest information.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  On this protest form, the taxpayer must identify which part of the \r\n  PTA she disagrees with, that is the propertyâ€™s value or its classification, \r\n  and propose her suggested value or class.Â  Â§ 12-60-2520(B)(5).Â  The assessor \r\n  must respond to the protest within 30 days, and give the taxpayer notice that \r\n  she must pursue any appeal before the county board of assessment appeals.Â  Â§ \r\n  12-60-2520(B)(4).\r\nThe county board of \r\n  assessment appeals(board) â€œmay rule on any timely appeal relating to the correctness \r\n  of any of the elements of the [PTA]â€¦.â€Â  Â§ 12-60-2530.Â  After the boardâ€™s written \r\n  disposition of an appeal, the aggrieved party (whether taxpayer or assessor) \r\n  may appeal to the Administrative Law Judge Division.Â  Â§ 12-60-2540.Â  If the \r\n  PTA appeal will not be concluded by December 31 of the tax year, the assessor \r\n  must ask the auditor to issue an adjusted property tax bill figured on 80% of \r\n  the protested assessment.Â  Â§ 12-60-2550.\r\nThese statutes contemplate \r\n  that a PTA protest will be initiated prior to the payment of any tax, and anticipates \r\n  that most PTA protests will be resolved before the taxes are due.Â  In situations \r\n  where the PTA appeal will not be concluded by December 31, Â§ 12-60-2550 provides \r\n  for the issuance of a reduced bill and mandates a refund if the appeal results \r\n  in a decision that the Taxpayer owes an amount less than the 80% already paid.Â  \r\n  Â§ 12-60-2550(C).\r\nThere may be situations where the PTA protest is initiated so close to the \r\n  tax due date that it is not possible for the auditor to issue an adjusted bill \r\n  as provided by Â§ 12-60-2550.Â  In those rare situations the taxpayer will be \r\n  required to pay the bill in full, and her remedy will be to initiate an administrative \r\n  refund action pursuant to Â§ 12-60-2560. \r\n  [13] \r\nWhile the Act contains many \r\n  specific procedures for taxpayers challenging their PTAs, relief under the Act \r\n  is not limited to these types of protests.Â  Section 12-60-2530(A) specifically \r\n  provides the board of assessment appeals may rule on any PTA dispute â€œand also \r\n  other relevant claims of a legal or factual nature except claims relating to \r\n  property tax exemptions.â€Â  Although no prepayment procedure is specified for \r\n  non-PTA protests, the Act does provide for a taxpayer to seek a refund of taxes \r\n  paid.Â  Â§ 12-60-2560 (2000).Â  The first part of this refund statute provides \r\n  that a person seeking a refund because of an alleged PTA error must comply with \r\n  the specific limitations found in Â§ 12-60-1750, which in turn refers to the \r\n  time limitations initiating PTA appeals.Â  Â§ 12-60-2560(A).Â  Subsection (A) of \r\n  the refund statute requires persons seeking administrative refunds for reasons \r\n  other than PTA errors to commence those actions within the time limits of Â§ \r\n  12-54-85(F), which is essentially a two-year statute of limitations.Â  If Â§ 12-60-2560 \r\n  were limited to PTA refunds, as the circuit court found here, then there would \r\n  be no reason for it to refer to Â§ 12-54-85(F) since the time limits for commencing \r\n  all related actions would be the 90 day PTA limit found in Â§ 12-60-2510(3). \r\n\r\nAs with PTA protests, a taxpayer commences a refund action by filing a claim \r\n  with the assessor.Â  Â§ 12-60-2560(A).Â  In refund actions, however, the assessor \r\n  together with the auditor and treasurer make the initial determination.Â  If \r\n  the refund request is denied, the taxpayer may appeal to the county board of \r\n  assessment appeals.Â  The refund statute contains a specific reference to the \r\n  boardâ€™s authority to rule on a timely PTA appeal, just as the PTA appellate \r\n  statute specifically refers to the boardâ€™s ability to rule on timely PTA appeals \r\n  as well as â€œother relevant claims of a legal or factual natureâ€¦â€Â  Compare \r\n  Â§ 12-60-2560(B) with Â§ 12-60-2530(B).Â  The refund statute then defaults \r\n  to the procedures followed by the board in a PTA appeal under Â§ 12-60-2530.Â  \r\n  Â§ 12-60-2560(B-D) (2000).\r\nA taxpayer disputing a PTA \r\n  must timely initiate his claim.Â  A timely PTA claim will, in almost all instances, \r\n  be made before any tax is due: if not resolved prior to that due date, then \r\n  a taxpayer may invoke the 80% payment procedure found in Â§ 12-60-2550.Â  In those \r\n  unusual circumstances where a PTA protest is not commenced prior to the tax \r\n  due date, and in all other circumstances where a taxpayer believes that he has \r\n  been wrongly or illegally required to pay a property tax, then the taxpayer \r\n  must first pay the tax and then initiate a request for a refund pursuant to \r\n  Â§ 12-60-2560.\r\nThese Taxpayers do not dispute any component of their PTA.Â  Rather, Taxpayers \r\n  complain that their PTA was subjected to a higher millage, and thus their tax \r\n  bills were inflated, as the consequence of the application of the unlawful Ordinance.Â  \r\n  Looking first to the Act, as we must, \r\n  [14]  we hold that Taxpayersâ€™ remedy is not this direct circuit court refund \r\n  suit, but rather an administrative refund pursuant to Â§ 12-60-2560.Â  In fact, \r\n  Taxpayers acknowledged at oral argument that they had initiated an administrative \r\n  refund action, which has been stayed pending disposition of this appeal.Â  Since \r\n  Taxpayers had this administrative refund remedy available to them, the circuit \r\n  court erred in refusing to dismiss this action without prejudice.Â  Â§ 12-60-3390.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court orders and remand this matter with \r\n  instructions to dismiss the suit without prejudice to Taxpayersâ€™ rights to pursue \r\n  their refund requests.\r\nWe are deeply concerned that other taxpayers within the class certified by \r\n  the circuit court judge [15]  in this case may have forgone \r\n  their administrative remedies in reliance on the orders issued in this case.Â  \r\n  For this reason, and because County concedes, as it must, that it is required \r\n  to return the unlawfully collected taxes, we instruct that all taxpayers within \r\n  the class who have not yet filed administrative refund actions shall have 120 \r\n  days after the remittitur is sent to file such claims.Â  Notice of this right \r\n  shall be given to all eligible taxpayers, in writing, by County within thirty \r\n  days of the filing of this opinion.\r\nFurther, we express our \r\n  disapproval of Countyâ€™s actions in all matters related to this Ordinance.Â  County \r\n  chose, in the face of a court order striking down the Ordinance and a blunt \r\n  warning by the trial judge that it was proceeding at its own risk, to collect \r\n  taxes pursuant to that Ordinance.Â  Once the Ordinanceâ€™s invalidity was confirmed \r\n  by this Court, County chose not to refund the illegally collected taxes promptly, \r\n  but chose instead to place obstacles in the way of its wronged taxpayers.Â  County \r\n  did not promptly pay refunds to taxpayers who initiated a court action, nor, \r\n  the record shows, did it pay those taxpayers who pursued administrative remedies.Â  \r\n  Instead of minimizing the fiscal impact of its unwise decision to levy taxes \r\n  in reliance on the Ordinance, County has expended more taxpayer money fighting \r\n  the refund-seekers on every front.\r\nFurther, in an unprecedented act, County audaciously suggested to the trial \r\n  judge, and now suggests to us, that the judicial system issue a writ of mandamus \r\n  to County requiring it to rebill all County taxpayers who benefited in 2001 \r\n  from the unlawful Ordinance.Â  It is axiomatic that mandamus, â€œthe highest judicial \r\n  writ known to the law,â€ [16]  lies only to compel the performance of a ministerial act and \r\n  â€œis limitedâ€¦to the protection of a plain, admitted, and unquestioned legal right \r\n  that has been arbitrarily or without due warrant of law denied.â€Â  Gardner \r\n  v. Blackwell, 167 S.C. 313, 320, 166 S.E. 338, 340 (1932).Â  Were the duty \r\n  so clear that issuance of this prerogative writ was warranted, then County would \r\n  not need our imprimatur in order to act. [17] Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court orders are reversed and the \r\n  case remanded with instructions to the circuit court to dismiss the suit without \r\n  prejudice pursuant to Â§ 12-60-3390.Â  Further, County shall, within thirty days \r\n  of this opinion, give written notice to all taxpayers within the class certified \r\n  by the circuit court, other than those who have already initiated administrative \r\n  refund requests, of their right to seek an administrative refund, and of the \r\n  date by which the refund request must be initiated.Â  Finally, pursuant to Rule \r\n  222(a), SCACR, we award Taxpayers their appellate costs, and a reasonable attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee.Â  Accordingly, the orders on appeal are\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nBURNETT, J., and Acting Justice J. Ernest Kinard, \r\n  Jr., concur.Â  MOORE, A.C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which WALLER, \r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MOORE:Â  The majorityâ€™s decision requires Taxpayers \r\n  to pursue administrative remedies by filing claims for refunds with the county \r\n  assessor under Â§ 12-60-2560.Â  I respectfully dissent. [18] Â \r\nAs the majority points out, Taxpayersâ€™ claims do not involve property tax assessments \r\n  but instead challenge the proper millage rate to be applied in calculating the \r\n  amount of tax due.Â  The county assessor has no authority regarding millage rates \r\n  and relief under Â§ 12-60-2560 is inappropriate.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  12-37-90 (2000) (responsibilities and duties of assessors); see also \r\n  County of Lee v. Stevens, 277 S.C. 421, 289 S.E.2d 155 (1982) (the authority \r\n  to set the tax rate belongs to the county governing body).Â  \r\nFurther, Chapter 60, Subarticle 9, including Â§ 12-60-2560, applies only to \r\n  complaints regarding county property tax assessments.Â Â  Section 12-60-2560 provides \r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(A)Â  Subject to the limitations \r\n  in Section 12-60-1750, and within the time limitation of Section 12-54-85(F), \r\n  a property taxpayer may seek a refund of real property taxes assessed by the \r\n  county assessor and paid . . . by filing a claim for refund with the county \r\n  assessor. . . .\r\n\r\nThe majority concludes the \r\n  reference to the statute of limitation found in Â§ 12-54-85(F) indicates that \r\n  Â§ 12-60-2560 must allow appeals aside from property tax assessments since property \r\n  tax assessments are already governed by the time lines set out in Â§ 12-60-2510.Â  \r\n  I disagree.Â  Refund claims under Â§ 12-60-2560 are governed by the general statute \r\n  of limitation in Â§ 12-54-85(F) because Â§ 12-60-2560 allows challenges to the \r\n  assessment ratio for prior years.Â  Other sections of the tax code specify that \r\n  Â§ 12-60-2560 is the remedy in this assessment context.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-43-220(c)(3) (2000) (allowing application under Â§ 12-60-2560 \r\n  for refund because the property was eligible for the legal residence assessment \r\n  ratio); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-252(B) (2000) (â€œWhen a person \r\n  qualifies for a refund pursuant to Sections 12-60-2560 and 12-43-220(c) \r\n  for prior yearsâ€™ eligibility for the four percent owner-occupied residential \r\n  assessment ratio, the person also may be certified for a homesteadÂ  tax exemption. \r\n  . . .â€).Â  This limited reading of Â§ 12-60-2560 is consistent with the remaining \r\n  sections of Subarticle 9 which all relate to county property tax assessments. \r\n\r\nIn sum, Chapter 60 does \r\n  not include contests to a countyâ€™s tax rate and the limitation in Â§ 12-60-80 \r\n  to the remedies provided in this chapter does not control.Â  I therefore agree \r\n  with the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that the administrative process is limited to \r\n  challenges to an individualâ€™s property tax assessment and does not apply here.Â  \r\n\r\nFurther, the majorityâ€™s \r\n  decision allows those who benefited from the illegal ordinance to retain a windfall.Â  \r\n  Since County has represented to this Court that it is willing to issue recalculated \r\n  tax bills to all taxpayers for the 2001 tax year, I would order it to do so.Â  \r\n  This is a fair resolution to ensure that all taxpayers equitably share the tax \r\n  burden for services provided in 2001.Â  If County simply pays refunds, the amount \r\n  refunded must be included as a liability in a future budget.Â  It is unfair that \r\n  Taxpayers would then be taxed to cover the cost of their own refunds.\r\nI would affirm. \r\n WALLER, concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Appellants/Respondents in this appeal are the \r\n    County and three county officials: the treasurer, the auditor, and the assessor.Â  \r\n    We will refer to them collectively as â€œCountyâ€ in this opinion.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Property classified as owner-occupied primary \r\n    residences is taxed on an assessment equal to four percent of the fair market \r\n    value of the property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-43-220(C)(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  All \r\n    other real property not specifically classified under section 12-43-220 is \r\n    taxed at six percent.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Different property within the County is subject \r\n    to different taxing entities depending on the propertyâ€™s location within, \r\n    for example, a municipality, and/or a special purpose district.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  County has adopted a Local Options Sales Tax (LOST).Â  See \r\n    S.C. Code Ann Â§Â§ 4-10-10 through -90 (Supp. 2003).Â  Pursuant to the LOST act, \r\n    each year a credit factor is determined for each taxing district within the \r\n    County; each parcelâ€™s individual credit is determined by multiplying the propertyâ€™s \r\n    fair market or special use value by the taxing entityâ€™s credit factor.Â  The \r\n    resulting credit is then subtracted from the tax assessment figure, resulting \r\n    in the actual tax owed by the property owner. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  See also County of Lee v. Stevens, \r\n    277 S.C. 421, 289 S.E.2d 155 (1982) (explanation of ad valorem real \r\n    property tax system).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  Reference to â€œpaying under protestâ€ is an anachronism; \r\n    under the current tax scheme in Title 12, Chapter 60, there is no requirement \r\n    that an ad valorem taxpayer pay â€œunder protestâ€ in order to pursue \r\n    a refund.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  We incorrectly suggested that the Riverwoods \r\n    plaintiffs could seek prepayment relief under Â§ 12-60-2550, a statute concerned \r\n    only with PTA protests.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  1995 Act No. 60.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]  In 2000, the General Assembly substituted the \r\n    phrase â€œdispute with the Department of Revenueâ€ for â€œany disputed liabilityâ€ \r\n    in Â§ 12-60-20.Â  See Â§ 12-60-20 (Supp. 2003).Â  Although this amendment \r\n    could be read as indicative of an intent to limit the Act to tax issues involving \r\n    the DOR, when amending Â§ 12-60-20 the legislature did not amend or repeal \r\n    those parts of the Act which deal solely with county tax disputes.Â  In light \r\n    of this, we hold that a court must look first to the Act when faced with a \r\n    question of county tax protest procedures.

Kearse, of Easley, Guardian ad\r\nLitem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This is a custody dispute arising \r\n  out of the custodial parentâ€™s relocation.Â  Appellant Michelle Latimer Farmer \r\n  (Mother) appeals the family court order concluding Respondent Daniel W. Farmer \r\n  (Father) should be allowed to relocate with their adopted child (Child).Â  Appellants \r\n  Charlotte and Stuart Latimer (Grandparents) appeal the family courtâ€™s order \r\n  denying them autonomous visitation rights with Child.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Father were married on June 4, 1988 and \r\n  were divorced on February 11, 2000 because of Motherâ€™s adultery with one John \r\n  Case.Â  \r\nApproximately a year and a half before the divorce, Father \r\n  and Mother adopted Child, a Romanian orphan born May 14, 1997.Â  Father and Mother \r\n  brought Child home to Greenville in August 1998.Â  Three weeks later, Father \r\n  discovered Motherâ€™s adulterous relationship with Case.Â  Mother agreed to terminate \r\n  the relationship and the couple were reconciled.\r\nIn May 1999, the partiesâ€™ adoption of Child was completed.Â  \r\n  One month later, Mother separated from Father.Â  Father became suspicious of \r\n  Motherâ€™s activities, and, at the suggestion of Motherâ€™s parents, hired a private \r\n  investigator who confirmed Mother was still involved in the adulterous relationship.Â  \r\n  Following initiation of divorce proceedings by Father, the parties, by agreement, \r\n  resolved all issues incident to the divorce.Â  The agreement provided Father \r\n  would have sole custody of Child and Mother was given visitation each week from \r\n  6:00 p.m. Thursday through 6:00 p.m. Saturday and additional visitation during \r\n  holiday and vacation periods. \r\nFather is an automation programmer. [1] Â  While in Greenville Father was employed by \r\n  Fluor-Daniel Corporation.Â  Father sought and received a job offer in Plymouth, \r\n  Michigan and now resides there with Child, his new wife, and a child born to \r\n  them.Â  \r\nWhen Father informed Mother he was moving to Michigan, Mother and Grandparents \r\n  sought and obtained an ex parte order preventing Father from moving to \r\n  Michigan with Child.Â  Appellants also sought a permanent restraining order preventing \r\n  Father from moving out of state with Child or, in the alternative, transfer \r\n  of custody to Mother.Â Â  A hearing was held in November 2001.Â  The court concluded \r\n  it to be in Childâ€™s best interests to allow Father to move to Michigan with \r\n  Child.Â  The court also denied Grandparentsâ€™ autonomous visitation rights independent \r\n  of those of Mother.Â  The court ordered extensive visitation for Mother, including \r\n  computer teleconferencing, e-mail, and telephone contact. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the family court err in allowing Father to relocate to Michigan \r\n  and declining to change custody of Child to Mother?\r\nII.Â  Â Â Â  Did the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) adhere to \r\n  the proper standards in conducting his investigation?\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the family court judge abuse his discretion in denying separate visitation \r\n  rights to Grandparents?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWhere a family court order is appealed, we have jurisdiction \r\n  to find facts based on our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  We \r\n  are not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility.Â  Strout \r\n  v. Strout, 284 S.C. 429, 327 S.E.2d 74 (1985).Â  This degree of deference \r\n  is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of the \r\n  child.Â  Dixon v. Dixon, 336 S.C. 260, 263, 519 S.E.2d 357, 359 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).Â Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve the appealing party of the \r\n  burden of showing the family court committed error.Â  Skinner v. King, \r\n  272 S.C. 520, 252 S.E.2d 891 (1979).\r\nI.\r\nWe are called upon to resolve one of the most challenging \r\n  problems our family courts encounter.Â  Cases involving the relocation of a custodial \r\n  parent with a minor child bring into direct conflict a custodial parentâ€™s freedom \r\n  to move to another state without permission from the court and the noncustodial \r\n  parentâ€™s right to continue his or her relationship with the child as established \r\n  before the custodial parentâ€™s relocation.Â Â  \r\nSome states recognize a presumption in favor of the custodial \r\n  parentâ€™s right to relocate.Â  See e.g., In re Custody of D.M.G. \r\n  &amp; T.J.G., 951 P.2d 1377, 1383 (Mont. 1998); In re Marriage of Burgess, \r\n  13 Cal.4th 25 (1996).Â  Since our decision in McAlister v. Patterson, \r\n  278 S.C. 481, 299 S.E.2d 322 (1982), the courts in this state have been guided \r\n  by a presumption against relocation in determining whether to allow a custodial \r\n  parent to relocate with a minor child.Â  We take this opportunity to review this \r\n  presumption.Â  Insofar as McAlister established a presumption against \r\n  relocation, we hereby overrule it for the following reasons.Â  \r\nFirst, we recognize that standards imposing restrictions \r\n  on relocation have become antiquated in our increasingly transient society.Â  \r\n  Second, confusion abounds surrounding the status of our relocation law, in part, \r\n  because of the often stated, but infrequently applied, presumption against relocation.Â  \r\n  In all child custody cases, including relocation cases, the controlling considerations \r\n  are the childâ€™s welfare and best interests.Â  The presumption against relocation \r\n  is a meaningless supposition to the extent a custodial parentâ€™s relocation would, \r\n  in fact, be in the childâ€™s best interest.\r\nUnder the present facts, Mother seeks a change in custody.Â  \r\n  As in all matters of child custody, a change in custody analysis inevitably \r\n  asks whether the transfer in custody is in the childâ€™s best interests.Â  In order \r\n  for a court to grant a change in custody, there must be a showing of changed \r\n  circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the divorce decree.Â  Davenport \r\n  v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 220 S.E.2d 228 (1975).Â  â€œA change in circumstances \r\n  justifying a change in the custody of a child simply means that sufficient facts \r\n  have been shown to warrant the conclusion that the best interests of the children \r\n  would be served by the change.â€Â  Stutz v. Funderburk, 272 S.C. 273, 276, \r\n  252 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1979).Â Â  The change of circumstances relied on for a change \r\n  of custody must be such as would substantially affect the interest and welfare \r\n  of the child.Â  Because the best interest of the child is the overriding concern \r\n  in all child custody matters, when a non-custodial parent seeks a change in \r\n  custody, the non-custodial parent must establish the following: (1) there has \r\n  been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child \r\n  and (2) a change in custody is in the overall best interests of the child.Â  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, Mother seeks a change in custody.Â  \r\n  Therefore, she bears the burden of establishing both of these criteria. [3] \r\nMother has failed to show a substantial change \r\n  in circumstances warranting a change in custody from Father to Mother for reasons \r\n  set forth below.Â Â  Fatherâ€™s remarriage, in and of itself, is not a sufficient \r\n  change of circumstance affecting the welfare of Child to warrant a transfer \r\n  of custody to Mother.Â  See Fisher v. Miller, 288 S.C. 576, 344 \r\n  S.E.2d 149 (1986) (remarriage alone is not sufficient to warrant a change in \r\n  custody).Â  Likewise, a change in Fatherâ€™s residence is not itself a substantial \r\n  change in circumstances affecting the welfare of Child, which justifies a change \r\n  in custody.Â  We decline to hold relocation in itself is a substantial change \r\n  in circumstance affecting the welfare of a child.Â  Relocation is one factor \r\n  in considering a change in circumstances, but is not alone a sufficient change \r\n  in circumstances.Â  One location may not necessarily affect the best interests \r\n  of the child as would another.Â  The effect of relocation on the childâ€™s best \r\n  interest is highly fact specific.Â  It should not be assumed that merely relocating \r\n  and potentially burdening the non-custodial parentâ€™s visitation rights always \r\n  negatively affects the childâ€™s best interests.Â  \r\n Not only has Mother failed to show a \r\n  change in circumstances affecting Childâ€™s welfare, she has also failed to show \r\n  a change in custody would be in Childâ€™s best interests.Â  We believe the best \r\n  interests of Child are served by Fatherâ€™s relocation with Child to Michigan.Â  \r\n  We have not previously delineated criteria for evaluating whether the best interests \r\n  of the child are served in relocation cases.Â  As noted by the Court of Appeals \r\n  in Pitt v. Olds, 327 S.C. 512, 519, 489 S.E.2d 666, 670 (Ct. App. 1997), \r\n  reversed on other grounds, 333 S.C. 478, 511 S.E.2d 60 (1999), other \r\n  states have provided criteria to guide a courtâ€™s decision.Â  We do not endorse \r\n  or specifically approve any of these factors for consideration, but merely provide \r\n  the following for consideration in determining whether a childâ€™s best interests \r\n  are served.Â  For example, the New York Court of Appeal has set forth the following \r\n  factors when determining if the childâ€™s best interests are served:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each parentâ€™s reasons for seeking or opposing \r\n  the move,\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the quality of the relationships between the child \r\n  and the custodial and noncustodial parents,\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the impact of the move on the quality of the childâ€™s \r\n  future contact with the noncustodial parent, \r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the degree to which the custodial parentâ€™s and \r\n  childâ€™s life may be enhanced economically, emotionally, and educationally by \r\n  the move, and\r\n  (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the feasibility of preserving the relationship \r\n  between the noncustodial parent and child through suitable visitation arrangements.\r\n\r\nTropea v. Tropea, 665 N.E.2d 145, 148 (N.Y. 1996). \r\nÂ Pennsylvania requires courts in potential relocation cases to\r\nconsider: \r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the potential advantages of the proposed \r\n  move,Â economic or otherwise;Â  \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the likelihood the move would improve \r\n  substantially the quality of life for the custodial parent and the children \r\n  and is not the result of a whim on the part of the custodial parent;\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the integrity of the motives of both \r\n  the custodial and noncustodial parent in seeking the move or seeking to prevent \r\n  it;\r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the availability of realistic \r\n  substitute visitation arrangements that will adequately foster an ongoing relationship \r\n  between the child and the noncustodial parent.\r\n\r\nGancas v. Schultz, 683 A.2d 1207, 1210 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1996).Â Â Â  \r\nMontana and Florida have compiled comparable factors. [4] \r\nApplying some of these factors to this case and considering \r\n  foremost the overriding consideration in all custody matters, i.e., the \r\n  best interests of the child, we affirm the family courtâ€™s order allowing Father \r\n  to relocate to Michigan and denying a change in custody.Â  \r\nFirst, the potential advantages of the proposed \r\n  move weigh in favor of Fatherâ€™s relocation.Â  Fatherâ€™s current job, unlike his \r\n  previous employment in Greenville, does not require travel, thereby allowing \r\n  him to spend more time with Child.Â  Additionally, Father has a stable family \r\n  environment in Michigan having his siblings in close vicinity.Â  Mother and her \r\n  family, on the other hand, have a history of familial discord.Â  Not only has \r\n  Motherâ€™s relationship with her parents been unstable, Motherâ€™s brother is currently \r\n  estranged from Grandparents.Â  \r\nChildâ€™s moral upbringing is also enhanced by her relocation with \r\n  Father.Â  The family court concluded even though Mother was a full time homemaker \r\n  prior to the partiesâ€™ separation, Father assumed the majority of the care of \r\n  Child when he came home from work.Â  The court also found Father has taken the \r\n  responsibility for the moral upbringing of Child by taking her to church and \r\n  reading her Bible stories.Â  \r\nSecond, we conclude it likely the move would improve the quality \r\n  of life for the custodial parent and the child, and it is not the result of \r\n  a whim on the part of the custodial parent.Â  For the reasons stated above, the \r\n  quality of Childâ€™s life would be enhanced by the dependable and loving family \r\n  environment in Michigan.Â  \r\nThird, the integrity of the motives of both the custodial and noncustodial \r\n  parent in seeking the move or seeking to prevent it neither weigh in favor of \r\n  nor against Childâ€™s best interests.Â  The family court concluded Fatherâ€™s primary \r\n  reason for the move was job related.Â  Neither Fatherâ€™s reasons for moving nor \r\n  Motherâ€™s reasons for seeking a change in custody seem to originate from spiteful \r\n  or vindictive motives thereby affecting Childâ€™s best interests.\r\nFourth, we \r\n  consider the availability of a realistic substitute visitation arrangement that \r\n  will adequately foster an ongoing relationship between Mother and Child.Â  Clearly, \r\n  the relationship between Mother and Child will be significantly affected given \r\n  the prior frequency of contact and the hardship now imposed on the visitation \r\n  schedule because of the distance to travel.Â  Mother is provided extensive contact \r\n  with Child given the distance involved.Â  As previously noted, the family court \r\n  ordered Mother would have extensive visitation with Child.Â  \r\nMother raises several evidentiary issues in disputing the \r\n  family courtâ€™s order that Childâ€™s relocation with Father is in Childâ€™s best \r\n  interests.Â  First, Mother argues the family court erred in allowing testimony \r\n  about her adulterous conduct predating the adoption hearing, which violated \r\n  principles of res judicata.Â  We disagree.Â  Res judicata requires three elements: \r\n  (1) the judgment must be final, valid and on the merits; (2) the parties in \r\n  the subsequent action must be identical in the first; (3) the second action \r\n  must involve matters properly included in the first action.Â  Plum Creek Dev. \r\n  Co., Inc. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 512 S.E.2d 106 (1999).Â  The third \r\n  element is not satisfied.Â  The courtâ€™s finding in the adoption hearing on the \r\n  fitness of parents for purposes of adoption has no bearing on any future determination \r\n  of custody.Â  \r\nAs to Motherâ€™s assertion the family court judge overemphasized \r\n  Motherâ€™s adultery in refusing to transfer custody to her, a review of the order \r\n  shows this determination was not based on Wifeâ€™s adulterous conduct. The family \r\n  court made specific findings regarding the best interests of Child and the effect \r\n  of her relocation on her welfare.Â  Specifically, the court found Father has \r\n  taken a proactive role in Childâ€™s life, has taken responsibility for Childâ€™s \r\n  moral upbringing, and has a history of fostering familial relationships.Â  It \r\n  is upon these bases the family court judge made his determination regarding \r\n  custody.Â  Even with no proof of adultery, the record supports the grant of custody \r\n  to Father.\r\nSecond, Mother argues the court failed to give due consideration \r\n  to Childâ€™s age and background in determining whether a change in custody was \r\n  appropriate. We disagree.Â  The court did consider Childâ€™s age and the fact Child \r\n  is a Romanian orphan and Mother previously had significant visitation.Â  Recognizing \r\n  the hardship imposed on the mother/daughter relationship, the Court made a special \r\n  provision for â€œliveâ€ video teleconferencing.Â  Additionally, Father actively \r\n  participated in the Romanian adoption and there is no indication Mother has \r\n  special knowledge regarding Romanian orphans.Â  \r\nFinally, Mother contends the court improperly ignored the \r\n  testimony of Heather Cirelli, an expert who spoke on the possible negative consequences \r\n  of Father relocating with Child.Â  We disagree.Â  In the courtâ€™s Order on Motion \r\n  to Reconsider, the court expressed great reservation about Cirelliâ€™s credentials.Â  \r\n  The court stated it exercised great latitude in even qualifying Cirelli as an \r\n  expert.Â  Cirelli was contacted about three weeks prior to trial and saw Child \r\n  only once.Â  To the extent Mother advanced a contrary opinion at trial, the family \r\n  court acted within its discretion in assigning more weight to Fatherâ€™s expert.Â  \r\n  See Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 21-22, 553 S.E.2d 251, 254 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001) (appellate court is not required to ignore the trial judge who saw \r\n  and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility \r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Mother has failed to show (1) \r\n  a substantial change in circumstances affecting Childâ€™s welfare and (2) a change \r\n  in custody advances Childâ€™s overall best interests.Â  Additionally, the court \r\n  did not err in its evidentiary rulings. \r\nII.\r\nMother argues the trial court erred in failing to require \r\n  the GAL to adhere to the standards we set forth in Patel v. Patel, 347 \r\n  S.C. 281, 555 S.E.2d 386 (2001).Â Â  The present case was filed in April 2000 \r\n  and pre-dates the Patel opinion.Â  Although the GAL was allowed to make \r\n  a recommendation regarding custody prior to the Patel decision, we conclude \r\n  the guardian meticulously conducted an independent, balanced, and impartial \r\n  investigation.Â  \r\nIn Patel, we set the baseline standards for the responsibilities \r\n  and duties of a GAL.Â  In particular, the GAL shall:\r\n\r\nconduct an independent, balanced, and impartial investigation to determine \r\n  the facts relevant to the situation of the child and the family, which should \r\n  include:Â  reviewing relevant documents; meeting with and observing the child \r\n  in the home setting and considering the childâ€™s wishes, if appropriate; and \r\n  interviewing parents, caregivers, and others with knowledge relevant to the \r\n  case.\r\n\r\nId. at 288, 555 S.E.2d at 390; see also South Carolina \r\n  Private Guardian Ad Litem Reform Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1549 (Supp. 2003) \r\n  (codifying the Patel guidelines with more specificity, but only directly \r\n  applicable to guardians ad litem appointed after January 15, 2003).\r\nIn Patel, the GALâ€™s investigation overwhelmingly \r\n  favored the husband.Â  For example, the GAL contacted the husbandâ€™s attorney \r\n  nineteen times, but failed to ever contact wifeâ€™s counsel.Â  The GAL only met \r\n  with the children when they were with the husband.Â  The GAL even secretly listened \r\n  in on conversations between husband and wife while visiting with the husband.Â  \r\n  Id. at 286, 555 S.E.2d at 388-89. Â The Court concluded the actions and \r\n  inactions of the GAL so tainted the decision of the family court that wife was \r\n  not afforded due process.Â  Id. at 286-87, 291, 555 S.E.2d at 389, 391.\r\nIn this case the GAL submitted two reports. The GAL \r\n  interviewed Mother on several occasions and observed Mother and Child together \r\n  on one occasion.Â  The GAL also met independently with Motherâ€™s new husband.Â  \r\n  When the GAL learned Mother had remarried, the GAL requested Mother send photographs \r\n  of her new home and Childâ€™s bedroom.Â  The GAL noted the Motherâ€™s residence was \r\n  â€œvery adequate.â€Â  The GAL also stated that if Child were placed with Mother \r\n  and her husband on a permanent basis, Child would not suffer.Â  The GAL testified \r\n  Mother did a good job with Child, takes good care of her and her husband seemed \r\n  â€œvery genteel.â€Â  \r\nThe GAL observed \r\n  Father with Child on two occasions.Â  One visit was at the former marital home \r\n  in Easley and the other was in the GALâ€™s office.Â  The GAL did not visit the \r\n  Father in Michigan, finding it would present an undue financial burden for the \r\n  litigants.Â  Instead, the GAL requested Father send information pertaining to \r\n  the town where Father was living, the schools, and pictures of the home.Â  Therefore, \r\n  there is no merit to Motherâ€™s assertion that the GAL was biased because he asked \r\n  Father to prepare an album for him with information about Fatherâ€™s situation. \r\n\r\nFinally, Mother \r\n  alleges the GAL has not spent substantial time with Child in eighteen months.Â  \r\n  To the contrary, the GAL consistently inquired of both parents as to Childâ€™s \r\n  situation.Â  The GAL filed a supplemental report in July 2003.Â  The GAL attended \r\n  depositions of Mother and Father about six weeks prior to the trial date.Â  At \r\n  that time the GAL asked questions and received updated information.Â  We conclude \r\n  the GAL showed no bias or prejudice in the investigation. \r\n\r\nIII.\r\nGrandparents \r\n  argue the trial court erred in failing to permit them some form of autonomous \r\n  visitation with Child.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(33) (Supp. 2003) provides the family court has exclusive \r\n  jurisdiction \r\n\r\nto order periods of visitation for the grandparents of a \r\n  minor child where . . . parents of . . . child . . . are divorced . . . regardless \r\n  of the existence of a court order or agreement, and upon a written finding that \r\n  the visitation rights would be in the best interests of the child and would \r\n  not interfere with the parent/child relationship.Â  In determining whether to \r\n  order visitation for the grandparents, the court shall consider the nature of \r\n  the relationship between the child and his grandparents prior to the filing \r\n  of the petition or complaint.\r\n\r\nIn Brown v. Earnhardt, 302 S.C. 374, 396 S.E.2d 358 (1990), we stated,\r\n\r\nit would seldom, if ever be in the best interests of the \r\n  child to grant visitation rights to the grandparents when their child, the parent, has \r\n  such rights.Â  Visitation by grandparents should be derivative; otherwise the \r\n  child might have four, or even six people competing for his company: father, \r\n  mother, paternal grandparents and maternal grandparents. \r\n\r\nId. at 377, 396 S.E.2d at 360 (quoting In the Matter of Adoption \r\n  of a Child by M., 355 A.2d 211, 213 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1976)).\r\nIn Camburn v. Smith, 355 S.C. 574, 586 S.E.2d 565 \r\n  (2003), we applied the United State Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Troxel v. \r\n  Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000).Â  Under Troxel, \r\n  the court must give â€œspecial weightâ€ to a fit parentâ€™s decision regarding visitation.Â  \r\n  Before visitation may be awarded to grandparents over a parentâ€™s objection, \r\n  one of two evidentiary hurdles must be met:Â  the parent must be shown to be \r\n  unfit by clear and convincing evidence, or there must be evidence of compelling \r\n  circumstances to overcome the presumption that the parental decision is in the \r\n  childâ€™s best interest.\r\nNo compelling \r\n  or exceptional circumstances exist in this case that would warrant autonomous \r\n  visitation.Â  This is a difficult case because Grandparents enjoyed a close relationship \r\n  with Child and were her primary caretakers during the marital difficulties between \r\n  Mother and Father.Â  However, given the tumultuous nature of the relationship \r\n  between Mother and Grandparents, we believe autonomous visitation with Grandparents \r\n  could divide the family further should Motherâ€™s relationship with her parents \r\n  again deteriorate.Â  A contentious environment created by an additional visitation \r\n  schedule would not be in Childâ€™s best interests.Â  However, we strongly encourage \r\n  Mother to foster an ongoing relationship between Child and Grandparents by sharing \r\n  her visitation time with Grandparents when Child visits her in South Carolina.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing \r\n  reasons, we affirm the decision of the family court (1) denying a change in \r\n  custody to Mother, (2) concluding the GAL followed appropriate standards in \r\n  his investigation, and (3) denying Grandparents autonomous visitation rights.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Clifton \r\n  Newman, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] While in Greenville, \r\n    Fatherâ€™s job entailed creating programs for automated industries, visiting \r\n    factories for which the programs were designed and implementing the programs.Â  \r\n    He has no formal education, but has received on the job training.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Telephone contact \r\n    is unlimited when initiated by Child.Â  Wife has two calls per week not to \r\n    exceed thirty minutes at specified times.Â  Computer teleconferencing is unlimited \r\n    when initiated by Child and one per week when initiated by Wife.Â  E-mail access \r\n    is unlimited.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Mother disagrees that she bears \r\n    the burden of showing a substantial change in circumstances.Â  Mother argues \r\n    Father seeks to modify the custody agreement.Â  However, the custody agreement \r\n    is silent on whether Father could move out of state with Child.Â  Therefore, \r\n    there was no agreement on relocation to be modified.Â  This case is distinguishable \r\n    from Pitt v. Olds, 333 S.C. 478, 511 S.E.2d 60 (1999).Â  In Pitt, \r\n    the custodial, relocating parent sought a modification of the custody order \r\n    to alter the visitation schedule and consequently bore the burden of showing \r\n    a substantial change in circumstances.Â  In the present case, the non-custodial \r\n    parent seeks a change in custody and therefore bears the burden of showing \r\n    sufficient changed circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â  [4] \r\n    Montanaâ€™s factors are:\r\n  \r\n  (1) whether the prospective advantage of the move will \r\n    improve the general quality of life for parent and child; (2) the integrity \r\n    of the custodial parentâ€™s motives in moving; (3) the integrity of the noncustodial \r\n    parentâ€™s motives for opposing the relocation, and the extent to which it is \r\n    intended to secure a financial advantage with respect to continuing child \r\n    support and; (4) the realistic opportunity for visitation which can provide \r\n    an adequate basis for preserving and fostering the noncustodial parentâ€™s relationship \r\n    with the child if relocation is permitted.\r\n  \r\n  Carter v. Schilb, 877 S.W.2d 665, 667-68 (Mont. \r\n    Ct. App. 1994).\r\n  Florida law provides the court must consider:\r\n  \r\n  (1) whether the move would be likely to improve the \r\n    general quality of life for both the residential parent and the child; (2) \r\n    the extent to which visitation rights have been allowed and exercised; (3) \r\n    whether the primary residential parent, once out of the jurisdiction, will \r\n    be likely to comply with any substitute visitation arrangements; (4) whether \r\n    the substitute visitation will be adequate to foster a continuing meaningful \r\n    relationship between the child and the secondary residential parent; (5) whether \r\n    the cost of transportation is financially affordable by one or both parties; \r\n    and (6) whether the move is in the best interests of the child.\r\n  \r\n  Florida Statutes Â§ 61.3(2)(d) (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25858","title":"Harden v.

Casey Manning, Post-Conviction Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25858\r\nSubmitted January 22, 2004 - Filed August \r\n  16, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nTara Shurling, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Donald J. Zelenka, Chief, Capital and Collateral Litigation, Assistant Deputy \r\n  Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, and Assistant Attorney General David Spencer, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  We granted certiorari to review \r\n  the denial of Benjamin Hardenâ€™s (Petitionerâ€™s) second application for post-conviction \r\n  relief (PCR).Â  We granted Petitionerâ€™s first application for PCR, which was \r\n  denied after a hearing, and dismissed his petition for failure of counsel to \r\n  perfect the appeal.Â  Petitionerâ€™s motion to reinstate the appeal was denied.\r\nPetitionerâ€™s second PCR application seeks review, pursuant \r\n  to Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991), of the denial \r\n  of his PCR application.Â  The PCR judge found Petitioner was entitled to belated \r\n  review of the denial of his first PCR application.Â  Given the unique circumstances \r\n  presented, we granted certiorari and directed Petitioner to address the question \r\n  on which this Court originally granted certiorari.\r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner was indicted for one count \r\n  of trafficking crack cocaine by conspiracy between April 1, 1997, and September \r\n  23, 1997, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C)(3) (2002) and four counts \r\n  of distribution of crack cocaine, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B)(1) \r\n  (2002).Â  Each count of distribution occurred between April 1, 1997, and September \r\n  23, 1997.Â  On each occasion Petitioner sold crack cocaine to undercover agents \r\n  or witnesses.Â  On January 5, 1998, Petitioner pled guilty to trafficking and \r\n  to four counts of distribution.Â  The trial judge sentenced Petitioner to twenty \r\n  years for trafficking and concurrent fifteen-year sentences for each count of \r\n  distribution.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas plea counsel ineffective for failing to object to and \r\n  advise Petitioner his convictions for both trafficking crack cocaine based on \r\n  conspiracy and the four distribution charges would violate double jeopardy?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues his convictions violate \r\n  double jeopardy principles because all of the distribution counts occurred during \r\n  the period encompassed by the trafficking indictment.Â  He argues PCR counsel \r\n  was ineffective in failing to raise the issue.Â  We disagree.\r\nA defendant who pleads guilty on the \r\n  advice of counsel may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of \r\n  the plea by showing (1) counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard \r\n  of reasonableness and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for, counselâ€™s \r\n  errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty, but would have gone to trial.Â  \r\n  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 369, 88 L.Ed.2d \r\n  203, 208 (1985);Â  McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995).Â  \r\n  Petitioner bears the burden of proving both attorney error and prejudice.Â  Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).\r\nThere is no statutory law or judicial \r\n  precedent in this State which holds a conviction for both conspiracy and the \r\n  substantive offense relating to the conspiracy, in violation of the trafficking \r\n  statute, constitutes double jeopardy.Â  An attorney is not required to anticipate \r\n  potential changes in the law which are not in existence at the time of the conviction.Â  \r\n  State v. Gilmore, 314 S.C. 453, 457, 445 S.E.2d 454, 456 (1994) overruled \r\n  on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  614 (1999).Â  Therefore, Petitionerâ€™s counsel was not deficient in failing to \r\n  advise Petitioner or object to Petitionerâ€™s sentencing on the double jeopardy \r\n  issue.Â  \r\nPetitioner relies on Matthews v. State, 300 S.C. 238, 387 \r\n  S.E.2d 258 (1990).Â  In Matthews, we concluded possession with intent \r\n  to distribute marijuana is a lesser included offense of trafficking in marijuana \r\n  when the trafficking charge is based on possession.Â  Therefore, we held a defendant \r\n  may not be convicted of both possession with intent to distribute and trafficking \r\n  based on possession.Â  Where possession of an identical amount of marijuana would \r\n  sustain convictions for both possession with intent to distribute and trafficking \r\n  based upon possession, the General Assembly did not intend to permit punishment \r\n  under both statutory provisions. [1] \r\n  Â  \r\nThe present case is distinguishable.Â  In Matthews, \r\n  the convictions at issue were based on a single act of possession.Â  A review \r\n  of the record shows that in this case the trafficking conviction was based on \r\n  a broader conspiracy than the individual transactions which supported the distribution \r\n  charges.Â  \r\nWhen examining issues related to a guilty plea, it is appropriate \r\n  to consider the entire record, including the transcript of the guilty plea, \r\n  and the evidence presented at the PCR hearing.Â  Anderson v. State, 342 \r\n  S.C. 54, 535 S.E.2d 649 (2000).Â  The solicitorâ€™s comments at the plea hearing \r\n  demonstrate the factual circumstances of this case are unlike those in Matthews.Â  \r\n  At the plea hearing, the solicitor stated the distribution indictments were \r\n  all based on audio-taped drug transactions.Â  Regarding the trafficking indictment, \r\n  however, the solicitor stated:\r\n\r\n[T]his is a hardened drug family or drug network run by&nbsp;\r\n[Petitioner] . . . . [F]or at least the last six or seven \r\n  years [Petitioner] and his family have been probably the most dangerous and biggest nuisance that Richland County has had.Â  [Petitioner] \r\n  had no less than eight to ten people that worked directly with him . . . He had a number of trailers where he would sell \r\n  crack cocaine out of.Â  They set up a videotape on [March 10, 1997] and it worked \r\n  for 29 days . . . during the daylight hours . . . and over 424 visits were made \r\n  to that one trailer alone that were drug related . . .We have audiotape of [Petitioner] \r\n  talking about buying a kilo [and] how he was going to make it and turn it into \r\n  crack . . .[On May 18, 1997], one of our stateâ€™s witnesses . . . saw [Petitioner] \r\n  with approximately a kilogram of cocaine.Â  There are also audiotapes of [Petitionerâ€™s] \r\n  sisters; again a family business, where they talk about how to make good crack \r\n  cocaine.\r\n\r\nThe solicitorâ€™s statements demonstrate the trafficking by conspiracy charge \r\n  was not based solely on the four instances of distribution for which Petitioner \r\n  was indicted.Â  Instead, the trafficking charge was based on a pattern of unlawful \r\n  drug activity over the course of a six-month period.\r\nIn sum, neither Matthews , supra, \r\n  nor any other case, holds Petitionerâ€™s conviction for conspiracy to traffic \r\n  cocaine and the four counts of distributing cocaine violate double jeopardy.Â  \r\n  Therefore, counsel was not deficient in failing to advise his client on the \r\n  issue or object to the sentence imposed.\r\nAlthough, unnecessary for resolution \r\n  of this case, in the interest of judicial economy, we address the underlying \r\n  double jeopardy issue.Â  The double jeopardy clauses of the United States and \r\n  South Carolina Constitutions protect against multiple punishments for the same \r\n  offense.Â  State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 519 S.E.2d 786 (1999).Â  A threshold \r\n  inquiry in this case is whether the same act is involved in different charges.Â  \r\n  Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 \r\n  (1932).Â  Trafficking may be accomplished by several means, including conspiracy. \r\n  [2] Â  Conspiracy is a separate offense from the substantive offense, which \r\n  is the object of the conspiracy.Â  A defendant may be separately indicted and \r\n  convicted of both the conspiracy, and the substantive offenses committed in \r\n  the course of the conspiracy.Â  State v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 149, 588 \r\n  S.E.2d 105, 108 (2003). [3]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold (1) \r\n  counsel was not ineffective in failing to advise his client or in failing to \r\n  object to the double jeopardy issue and (2) there is no underlying double jeopardy \r\n  violation supporting Petitionerâ€™s claim.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1] The Court did not apply the test set forth in Blockburger v.

Johnson, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25859\r\nSubmitted April 21, 2004 - Filed August \r\n  23, 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLake Eric Summers, of Vinton D. Lide &amp; Associates, of Lexington, for Appellant. \r\n\r\nBennie Wicker, Jr., of Bennettsville, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â  This is a direct \r\n  appeal from an order of the circuit court which affirmed the decision of the \r\n  Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).Â  The ALJ held that Respondent, Bennie Wicker, \r\n  was entitled to be compensated the prevailing wage of $5.25 per hour for the \r\n  time he was in training for his employment at the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Corrections (DOC) Division of Prison Industries.Â  Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWicker, while an inmate at Evans Correctional Institute, participated \r\n  in the Prison Industries Program.Â  During the first 320 hours of his employment, \r\n  he was paid .25-.75 per hour; he was thereafter paid an hourly wage of $5.25.Â  \r\n  He filed an inmate grievance contending his training wages violated the Prevailing \r\n  Wage Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(D) (Supp. 2002).Â  The DOC denied his \r\n  appeal, and he appealed to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).Â  The ALJ reversed \r\n  the DOCâ€™s decision, finding Wicker was entitled to the prevailing wage during \r\n  his first 320 hours of employment, and finding no authority for the DOC to deviate \r\n  from the plain requirement of Â§ 24-3-430.Â  Accordingly, the DOC was ordered \r\n  to compensate Wicker at a rate of $5.25 per hour for his first 320 hours of \r\n  work.Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in holding Wicker was entitled \r\n  to a $5.25 per hour training wage?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe statutes under which Wicker seeks relief \r\n  are part of a statutory scheme creating a Prison Industries (PI) program to \r\n  provide for employment of convicts and utilize their labor for self-maintenance \r\n  and reimbursement of expenses.Â  SeeÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-310 (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  In 1995, the General Assembly enacted S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  24-3-430, authorizing the DOC to use inmate labor in private industry.Â  \r\n  Section 24-3-430 (D) provides that, â€œ[n]o inmate participating in the program \r\n  may earn less than the prevailing wage for work of similar nature in the private \r\n  sector.â€Â  Wicker filed an inmate grievance with the DOC, alleging his training \r\n  wage of .25-.75 per hour was in violation of the statute.Â  The DOC denied his \r\n  grievance and he appealed to the ALJ, who reversed.Â  The ALJ found no statutory \r\n  authority for DOC to pay Wicker less than the prevailing wage;Â  the circuit \r\n  court affirmed.Â  \r\nThe DOC appeals, contending the statutes under \r\n  which Wicker seeks relief do not entitle him to the prevailing wage, and asserting \r\n  the ALJ was without subject-matter jurisdiction to hear his appeal.\r\nAs recognized in the companion case of Adkins \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, Op. No. 25860 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\n  August 23, 2004), we agree with the DOC that section 24-3-430 (D) does not give \r\n  rise to a private, civil cause of action in Wicker.Â  However, simply because \r\n  Wicker may not file a civil claim for damages in circuit court does not mean \r\n  he is without any remedy.Â  There are numerous issues relating to inmates which, \r\n  although not giving rise to a private, civil cause of action, are nonetheless \r\n  grievable through DOCâ€™s internal grievance processes.Â  For example, although \r\n  inmates may not sue for civil damages on matters relating to parole, work release, \r\n  or work credits, they may enforce such rights via DOC grievance procedures.Â  \r\n  We find no reason such procedures should not apply when an inmate challenges \r\n  the wages he or she is being paid, particularly where there is a statute mandating \r\n  payment of the prevailing wage.Â Â  Accordingly, we hold that although Wicker \r\n  has no claim for civil damages, he properly filed a grievance with the DOC.Â  \r\n\r\nThe DOC also contends, citing the ALJD's en \r\n  banc decision in McNeil v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, 02-ALJ-04-00336-AP \r\n  (filed Sept. 5, 2001), that the ALJ was without subject-matter jurisdiction \r\n  to review its denial of Wickerâ€™s grievance.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWe find that where, as here, the state has \r\n  created a statutory right to the payment of a prevailing wage, it cannot thereafter \r\n  deny that right without affording due process of law.Â  Cf.Â  Piatt \r\n  v. MacDougall, 773 F.2d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 1985) (where state \r\n  has established, by statute, a right of inmates to compensation for work performed \r\n  for private parties, it cannot deny that right after they earned the wages, \r\n  without affording due process of the law); Borror v. White, 377 F. Supp. \r\n  181 (W.D.Va.1974) (although there was no federal constitutional right to payment, \r\n  inmate might be entitled to such compensation under state statute).Â Â  \r\nWe are not unmindful of our opinion in Sullivan \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 355 S.C. 437, 586 S.E.2d 124 (2003), \r\n  in which we held the ALJ has jurisdiction to review DOC grievance proceedings \r\n  only if they involve the denial of â€œstate created liberty interests.â€Â  There, \r\n  we recognized that our opinion in Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, \r\n  368, 527 S.E.2d 742, 750 (1999), held that administrative matters typically \r\n  arise in two ways:Â  (1) when an inmate is disciplined and punishment is imposed \r\n  and (2) when an inmate believes prison officials have erroneously calculated \r\n  his sentence, sentence-related credits, or custody status.Â  However, we did \r\n  not limit Al-Shabazz to these two instances.Â  The Al-Shabazz Court \r\n  explained that procedural due process is guaranteed when an inmate is deprived \r\n  of an interest encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty \r\n  and property.Â Â  338 S.C. at 369, 527 S.E.2d at 750.Â  \r\nWe find the stateâ€™s statutory mandate that \r\n  inmates be paid the prevailing wage creates such an interest, which may not \r\n  be denied without due process.Â  Piatt v. McDougall, supra.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  in this very limited circumstance, \r\n  [1]  we hold the DOCâ€™s failure to pay in accordance with the statutes is \r\n  reviewable by the ALJ.\r\nFinally, we concur with the ALJ and the circuit \r\n  court that there is simply nothing in the statutory scheme authorizing the DOC \r\n  to pay Wicker a training wage less than the prevailing wage.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, \r\n  341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (If a statute's language is plain, \r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation \r\n  are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaningâ€).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the judgment below is affirmed.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., and BURNETT, J., concur.Â  PLEICONES, \r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion.Â  MOORE, J., not participating.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  As explained more fully in my concurring opinion \r\n  in Adkins v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, Op. No. 25860 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed August 23, 2004), I would hold that respondentâ€™s remedy is found \r\n  in the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-10, et \r\n  seq. (Supp. 2003).Â  Accordingly, I dissent. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â  We note that our holding today is extremely \r\n    limited and is not to be viewed as expanding the jurisdiction of the ALJD \r\n    in any other circumstance.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25860","title":"Adkins v.

Lide \r\n  &amp; Associates, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â  This case involves \r\n  interpretation of S.C. Code Ann. Sections 24-3-40, 24-3-410, and 24-3-430 (Supp. \r\n  2002) (the Prevailing Wage statutes).Â  Appellants, Inmates confined within the \r\n  South Carolina Department of Corrections (DOC), instituted this action asserting \r\n  they were entitled to certain wages pursuant to the statutes.Â  The circuit court \r\n  ruled the statutes provided no private right of action for Inmates.Â  We affirm \r\n  in result.\r\nFACTS\r\nInmates, while housed at Tyger River \r\n  Correctional Institute, were employed in a Prison Industries/Private Sector \r\n  Program, for Standard Plywoods, making â€œAnderson Hardwood Floors.â€Â  At the time \r\n  of their initial employment, Inmates were paid a .25 per hour â€œtraining wage.â€Â  \r\n  After 160 hours, they were paid a .75 per hour â€œtraining wage.â€ \r\n  [1] Â  After completion of 320 hours, Inmates were paid the minimum wage \r\n  of $5.15 per hour.Â  \r\nInmates filed this Tort Claims action, \r\n  [2]  maintaining their training wages and hourly wages did not satisfy the \r\n  Prevailing Wage statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(D); \r\n  [3]  they contended the prevailing wage for work of a similar nature ranged \r\n  from $9.00-$14.00 per hour, and that DOCâ€™s failure to pay wages in accordance \r\n  with the statute was grossly negligent.Â  \r\nThe circuit court ruled the applicable \r\n  statutes did not give rise to a private cause of action in Inmates.Â  The court \r\n  further held the DOC was paying Inmates in accordance with the statutes, and \r\n  that, in any event, Inmates had not established DOCâ€™s method of payment was \r\n  grossly negligent, as required to maintain a Tort Claims action.Â  \r\nISSUE [4] \r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in holding the Prevailing Wage statutes \r\n  did not create a private right of action in Inmates? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn 1995, the General Assembly enacted \r\n  Â§ \r\n  24-3-430, authorizing the DOC to use inmate labor in private industry.Â  \r\n  Section 24-3-430 provides:Â Â  \r\n\r\n(A) The Director of the Department of Corrections may establish \r\n  a program involving the use of inmate labor by a nonprofit organization or in \r\n  private industry for the manufacturing and processing of goods, wares, or merchandise \r\n  or the provision of services or another business or commercial enterprise considered \r\n  by the director to enhance the general welfare of South Carolina. . . . Inmates \r\n  participating in such labor shall not benefit in any manner contradictory to \r\n  existing statutes. \r\n(B) The director may enter into contracts necessary to implement \r\n  this program.Â  The contractual agreements may include rental or lease agreements \r\n  for state buildings or portions of them on the grounds of an institution or \r\n  a facility of the Department of Corrections and provide for reasonable access \r\n  to and egress from the building to establish and operate a facility.\r\n(C) An inmate may participate in the program established \r\n  pursuant to this section only on a voluntary basis and only after he has been \r\n  informed of the conditions of his employment.\r\n(D) No inmate participating in the program may earn less \r\n  than the prevailing wage for work of similar nature in the private sector.\r\n(E) Inmate participation in the program may not result in \r\n  the displacement of employed workers in the State of South Carolina and may \r\n  not impair existing contracts for services.\r\n(F) Nothing contained in this section restores, in whole \r\n  or in part, the civil rights of an inmate.Â  No inmate compensated for participation \r\n  in the program is considered an employee of the State.\r\n(G) No inmate who participates in a project designated by \r\n  the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance pursuant to Public Law 90-351 \r\n  is eligible for unemployment compensation upon termination from the program.\r\n(H) The earnings of an inmate authorized to work at paid \r\n  employment pursuant to this section must be paid directly to the Department \r\n  of Corrections and applied as provided underÂ  Section 24-3-40. \r\n  [5] \r\n\r\nInmates assert the circuit court erred \r\n  in ruling the â€œthe prevailing wage statute did not create a right to sue for \r\n  [them] and was not enacted for [their] benefit.â€Â  \r\nInitially, we note that the DOCâ€™s failure to pay \r\n  a certain wage simply does not constitute a tort so as to be cognizable under \r\n  the Tort Claims Act.Â Â  Further, even if this were a Tort Claims case, the circuit \r\n  court correctly ruled the DOC was immune from liability under S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-60(5)(governmental entity not liable for loss resulting from the exercise \r\n  of discretion or judgment by the governmental entity or employee or the performance \r\n  or failure to perform any act or service which is in the discretion or judgment \r\n  of the governmental entity or employee).Â  In any event, we agree with the circuit \r\n  court that the statutes relied upon by Inmates do not give rise to a private, \r\n  civil cause of action.Â  \r\nThe primary consideration in deciding \r\n  whether a private cause of action should be implied under a criminal statute \r\n  is legislative intent.Â  Dorman v. Aiken Communications, Inc., 303 S.C. \r\n  63, 398 S.E.2d 687 (1990).Â  â€œThe legislative intent to grant or withhold a private \r\n  right of action for violation of a statute or the failure to perform a statutory \r\n  duty, is determined primarily from the language of the statute. . . .Â  In this \r\n  respect, the general rule is that a statute which does not purport to establish \r\n  a civil liability, but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare \r\n  of the public as an entity is not subject to a construction establishing a civil \r\n  liability.â€Â  Whitworth v. Fast Fare Markets of South Carolina, Inc., \r\n  289 S.C. 418, 420, 338 S.E.2d 155, 156 (1985).Â  Where a statute does not specifically \r\n  create a private cause of action, one can be implied only if the legislation \r\n  was enacted for the special benefit of a private party.Â  Citizens for \r\n  Lee County v. Lee County, 308 S.C. 23, 416 S.E.2d 641 (1992) (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\n  Given that the overall purpose of the prevailing wage statute is to prevent \r\n  unfair competition, and to aid society and the public in general, we cannot \r\n  conclude that the statutes in question were enacted for the special benefit \r\n  of Inmates.Â Â Â Â  \r\nSection 24-3-410 is entitled â€œSale of \r\n  prison-made products on open market generally prohibited;Â  penalties.â€Â  Violation \r\n  of the statute is a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, a person must be fined \r\n  not less than two hundred nor more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned \r\n  for not less than three months nor more than one year, or both.Â Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 24-3-410(C).Â  Although section 24-3-430 does not specifically set forth \r\n  criminal penalties, section 24-3-420 states that â€œAny person who willfully violates \r\n  any of the provisions of this article other than Â§ 24-3-410 shall be guilty \r\n  of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be confined in jail not less than \r\n  ten days nor more than one year, or fined not less than ten dollars nor more \r\n  than five hundred dollars, or both, in the discretion of the court.â€Â  Nothing \r\n  in the statutes indicates a legislative intent to create civil liability for \r\n  a violation of the statutes.Â  Accordingly, they do not give rise to a private \r\n  right of action. [6] Â  Cf., Linder v. Insurance Claims \r\n  Consultants, Inc., 348 S.C. 477, 560 S.E.2d 612 (2002) (criminal statutes \r\n  which prohibit unauthorized practice of law do not give rise to private right \r\n  of action); Dorman v. Aiken Communications, Inc., 303 S.C. 63, 398 S.E.2d \r\n  687 (1990) (construing Â§ 16-3-730, prohibiting publication of name of victim \r\n  of criminal sexual conduct, as a criminal statute created primarily for the \r\n  protection of the public, such that it does not create a private right of action). [7] Â Â  \r\n However, notwithstanding our holding that Inmates \r\n  have no private civil cause of action, they are not without a remedy.Â  In accordance \r\n  with the companion case of Wicker v. State, Op. No. 25859 (S.C. Sup. \r\n  Ct. filed August 23, 2004), we hold Inmates may file an inmate grievance to \r\n  protest DOCâ€™s failure to pay wages in accordance with the mandatory statutory \r\n  provisions.Â Â Â  \r\n AFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that the inmates in this \r\n  matter do not have a cause of action under the Tort Claims Act.Â  I conclude, \r\n  however, that the Prevailing Wage Statute [8]  was intended for the benefit of the Inmates. [9] Â  Citizens for Lee County v. Lee County, \r\n  308 S.C. 23, 416 S.E.2d 641 (1992).Â  In my opinion, the fact that the Legislature \r\n  provided for the distribution of part of these wages to pay the inmateâ€™s legal \r\n  obligations while incarcerated, and included a provision providing for the return \r\n  of the wages escrowed for the inmateâ€™s benefit upon his release, is evidence \r\n  that Â§ 24-3-430 was intended for the welfare of the inmate, not the general \r\n  public.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40 (Supp. 2003).Â  I would hold that an inmate \r\n  who claims not to have been paid the prevailing wage is entitled to proceed \r\n  under the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-10, et \r\n  seq. (Supp. 2003). [10]  \r\n  Accordingly, I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision upholding the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  dismissal of this Tort Claims suit, but do not join the holding that the inmatesâ€™ \r\n  remedy is an administrative grievance. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  The policy of paying a training wage ended July \r\n    1, 1999.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10 et seq.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  Section 24-3-430 (D) provides that â€œ[n]o inmate \r\n    participating in the program may earn less than the prevailing wage for work \r\n    of similar nature in the private sector.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [4] Â  In light of our holding, we need not address \r\n    Inmatesâ€™ claim that the trial court erred in denying their motion to transfer \r\n    the case to the jury roster.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Â  Section 24-3-40 allows an inmateâ€™s wages to be \r\n    distributed for restitution, child support, purchase of incidentals for the \r\n    inmate, state and federal taxes, and 10% in an interest bearing account for \r\n    the benefit of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] Â  The trial court relied upon federal cases interpreting \r\n    the Ashurst-Sumners Act, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1761, to support its findings that the \r\n    prevailing wage statute does not give rise to a private cause of action in \r\n    inmates.Â  In light of our holding, we need not address federal caselaw.Â  However, \r\n    we note the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by the caselaw.Â  See \r\n    Harker v. State Use Industries, 990 F.2d 131 (4th Cir.), \r\n    cert. denied 510 U.S. 886 (1993);Â  McMaster v. Minnesota, 819 \r\n    F.Supp. 1429 (D. Minn. 1993).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] Â  The concurrence would hold inmates have a private \r\n    cause of action under the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§Â§ 41-10-10, et seq. (Supp. 2003).Â  However, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) \r\n    provides that â€œ[i]n case of any failure to pay wages due to an employee \r\n    . . .Â  the employee may recover in a civil action.â€Â  Notably, section \r\n    24-3-430 (F) of the Prevailing Wage statute specifically states that â€œ[n]o \r\n    inmate compensated for participation in the program is considered an employee \r\n    of the State.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  In my view, this further evinces a \r\n    legislative intent not to create a private right of action.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430 (Supp. 2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]  I agree that it was also intended for the benefit \r\n    of private industries whose products or services could be impacted if unfair \r\n    competition resulted from underpayment of wages to inmate laborers.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [10]  Under the Payment of Wages Act, â€œEmployerâ€ is \r\n    defined to include the employer and that employerâ€™s agents. Â§ 41-10-10(1).Â Â  \r\n    The Prison Industries Act provides â€œthe employer of a prisoner authorized \r\n    to work . . . in a prison industry program . . . shall pay the wages directly \r\n    to the Department of Corrections . . .â€ and then requires the Department to \r\n    distribute those wages.Â  Â§ 24-3-40.Â  In my opinion, the Department of Corrections, \r\n    as agent of the employer, is subject to an inmateâ€™s claim made pursuant to \r\n    the Payment of Wages Act.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Warren Stephen Curtis","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2004-08-20-02","description":"This is an order reinstating an attorney to the practice of law.","date":"2004-08-23","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court \r\n  of South Carolina  \r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Warren \r\n  Stephen Curtis, Petitioner.\r\n  \r\n\r\nORDER\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n On July 14, 2003, petitioner was \r\n  suspended from the practice of law for two years, retroactive to June 17, 2002, \r\n  the date of his interim suspension.

He was subsequently found to be a sexually violent predator \r\n  pursuant to the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVP Act), and \r\n  was involuntarily committed to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health.\r\nThereafter, appellant filed a notice \r\n  of appeal. Counsel for appellant, pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 \r\n  U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Johnson v. State, 294 \r\n  S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988), and Ex Parte Cauthen, 291 S.C. 465, \r\n  354 S.E.2d 381 (1987), filed an affidavit with the Court stating he found no \r\n  basis for appellant's allegations in the record and that he felt the appeal \r\n  had no merit. Counsel attached a copy of the transcript and asked the Court \r\n  to review it for any meritorious issue.\r\nThe State filed a motion to strike \r\n  the affidavit stating that, while counsel's conclusion that the appeal lacked \r\n  merit was correct, there is no authorized procedure for filing an affidavit \r\n  in lieu of a brief and designation of matter as required by the South Carolina \r\n  Appellate Court Rules. The State argues there is no authority to solely submit \r\n  an affidavit in sexually violent predator cases, but states it has no objection \r\n  to the Court establishing a procedure for such a practice.\r\nThereafter, counsel for appellant \r\n  filed a &quot;Memorandum of Issues of Colorable Merit&quot; alleging two errors \r\n  of the trial court. Counsel also filed a return to the State's motion to strike \r\n  his affidavit. Therein, counsel outlines the trial proceeding and why appellant's \r\n  appeal lacks merit. Counsel also explains the authority he relied upon in filing \r\n  the transcript and affidavit, and requests the Court institute a procedure for \r\n  filing no-merit appeals in regards to the involuntary commitment of sexually \r\n  violent predators.\r\nAlthough a person committed under \r\n  the SVP Act has no Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel, as does an \r\n  accused in a criminal proceeding, they do have a statutory right to counsel. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-48-90 (2003). We have adopted a no-merit procedure \r\n  in the post-conviction relief context in Johnson, supra, and feel it is appropriate \r\n  to do so here, as well. Accordingly, we hereby adopt an Anders-type procedure, \r\n  as we did in Johnson, supra, for alleged no-merit SVP involuntary commitment \r\n  appeals. Therefore, the motion to strike the affidavit is granted. In addition, \r\n  counsel is instructed to withdraw his &quot;Memorandum of Colorable Issues of \r\n  Merit&quot; and submit in its place a brief, pursuant to Anders, supra, outlining \r\n  all issues of arguable merit, a copy of the record on appeal, and a motion to \r\n  be relieved as counsel. This will be the procedure for all future cases involving \r\n  alleged no-merit SVP involuntary commitment appeals.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.

We issued an opinion in this case in September \r\n  2002.  In the Interest of: Michael H., a minor under the age of seventeen \r\n  years, Op. No. 25529 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed September 16, 2002).  Subsequently, \r\n  we granted the Stateâ€™s petition for rehearing and a motion by the South Carolina \r\n  Victimâ€™s Assistance Network to file an amicus brief.    After rehearing this \r\n  case, we withdraw our previous opinion and substitute this opinion. \r\nFactual / Procedural Background \r\nRespondent was charged, by juvenile petition filed in Lexington \r\n  County family court, with CSC in the first degree, kidnapping, and CSC with \r\n  a minor.  Respondent is the complainantâ€™s uncle, although he is only eight years \r\n  older than the complainant.  At the time of the alleged assault, Respondent \r\n  was twelve or thirteen years old and the complainant was four or five years \r\n  old.  Due to premature birth and complications, Respondent is developmentally \r\n  impaired and exhibits a maturity level below others his age. \r\n  [1]   The complainant often spent time at Respondentâ€™s house (the home of \r\n  complainantâ€™s paternal grandmother) where Respondent, his younger brother, and \r\n  complainant played together and also took baths and showers together when complainant \r\n  spent the night. [2]   It was \r\n  during one of these showers that the complainant claimed Respondent â€œrapedâ€ \r\n  him.\r\nThe allegation arose in March 1999, in response to a story on the \r\n  local news about a man arrested for indecent exposure.  The complainantâ€™s mother \r\n  testified the complainant saw the report and asked her why the man had â€œrobbedâ€ \r\n  the children.  The mother responded that the man had not â€œrobbedâ€ the children \r\n  but had â€œrapedâ€ the children, and then explained to her son what rape was.  \r\n  The complainantâ€™s mother testified she told her son that rape of a boy â€œwould \r\n  be if someone was to touch him in an area that was covered by his swimsuit or \r\n  his underwear, if someone was to touch his penis or play with his penis, or \r\n  someone may try and stick [his] penis or something into his behind.â€  Upon hearing \r\n  this explanation, the complainantâ€™s mother said her sonâ€™s expression changed, \r\n  and he told her, â€œwell, [Respondentâ€™s] done that to me before.â€  \r\nComplainantâ€™s mother then testified she asked her son when and where \r\n  this happened, and he responded it had happened a while ago when he was in the \r\n  shower with Respondent.  Complainantâ€™s mother called her mother-in-law, Respondentâ€™s \r\n  mother, to inform her of her sonâ€™s accusation.  Respondent spoke with complainantâ€™s \r\n  mother, and denied ever having done anything like that to the complainant.  \r\n\r\nThe complainantâ€™s mother filed a report with the police and took \r\n  complainant to the Lexington County Childrenâ€™s Center where a rape protocol \r\n  was performed and counseling began.  The doctor performing the rape protocol \r\n  found no evidence of sexual assault but testified this was not unusual with \r\n  anal rape after significant time had passed.  Complainantâ€™s counselor, Dr. Lake, \r\n  a clinical psychologist, testified she believed Respondent had sexually assaulted \r\n  victim. [3]   During cross-examination \r\n  of Dr. Lake, Respondentâ€™s counsel discovered he had not received notes from \r\n  the complainantâ€™s last four sessions with Dr. Lake.  Respondent asked the judge \r\n  for time to review them and then completed his cross-examination.  In these \r\n  last four sessions, complainant reported he had been hearing voices in his head \r\n  for some time.  Complainant told Dr. Lake he began hearing the voices of two \r\n  men on his fourth birthday, and they continued until a month or so before trial.  \r\n  Complainant told Dr. Lake the voices told him to say mean things to his friends \r\n  and to hurt them, and that the voices told him he should have raped Respondent \r\n  like Respondent had raped him.  \r\nDr. Lake thought the voices might be auditory hallucinations and \r\n  suggested to complainantâ€™s mother that he see a physician or a psychiatrist \r\n  for diagnosis or treatment.  Dr. Lakeâ€™s notes reflected, however, that the voices \r\n  stopped shortly before trial.  Dr. Lake attributed this change to medication \r\n  complainant began taking for attention-deficit and hyperactivity.  The complainant \r\n  never saw a physician or a psychiatrist about the voices.  \r\nPrior to the hearing, Respondent filed a motion to have complainant \r\n  submit to a psychological evaluation.  Apparently that motion was denied.  Following \r\n  Dr. Lakeâ€™s testimony, Respondent moved again to have complainant submit to a \r\n  psychological evaluation based on the revelation that complainant had been hearing \r\n  voices during the period of time he alleged the assault occurred.  That motion \r\n  was denied.  Respondentâ€™s counsel also moved to have the complainantâ€™s testimony \r\n  stricken as incompetent, based on the report of hearing voices.  That motion \r\n  was denied as well.  \r\nAt trial, complainant testified Respondent raped him, explaining, \r\n  in his own words, that Respondent â€œstuck his penis up my butt.â€  Respondent \r\n  also testified at trial and denied he had sexually assaulted the complainant \r\n  in any way.\r\nThe trial judge granted Respondentâ€™s motion for directed verdict \r\n  on the first degree CSC and kidnapping charges based on insufficient evidence \r\n  but found Respondent guilty of CSC with a minor and ordered him committed to \r\n  the Department of Juvenile Justice (â€œDJJâ€) until his twenty-first birthday.  \r\n  Respondent appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new \r\n  trial.  In the Interest of Michael H., Op. No. 02-UP-050 (S.C. Ct. App. \r\n  filed January 18, 2002).\r\nThe State then filed a Petition for Rehearing and Suggestion for \r\n  Rehearing En Banc.  In response, Respondent filed a Petition for Appeal Bond \r\n  or in the Alternative for Writ of Supersedeas.  The Court of Appeals denied \r\n  the Petition for Rehearing but granted Respondentâ€™s Petition for Appeal Bond.  \r\n\r\nSubsequently, the State petitioned this Court for a stay of the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ order granting bond and for supersedeas.  Justice Moore denied \r\n  the petition on behalf of the Court on the ground that the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  order was not appealable.  On the same day, the family court set the conditions \r\n  of the bond.\r\nWe granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to address \r\n  the following issues:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that the family court \r\n      judge abused his discretion in failing to order the victim to submit to \r\n      a psychological examination? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the Court of Appeals act beyond its jurisdiction when \r\n      it granted Respondentâ€™s Appeal Bond?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological Examination\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the \r\n  family court judge abused his discretion in failing to order the child victim \r\n  to submit to a psychological examination.  We disagree.\r\nAs a preliminary matter, the State argues that this issue is not \r\n  preserved for review.  The State asserts trial counselâ€™s complaint was grounded \r\n  in perceived discovery violations concerning the notes of Dr. Lake that had \r\n  not been turned over to him.  We disagree.  Important information regarding \r\n  the mental health of the child victim was uncovered in Respondentâ€™s cross-examination \r\n  of Dr. Lake.  At the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Respondent moved for a psychological \r\n  evaluation based on this evidence.  Obtaining the psychological evaluation, \r\n  not pursuing the discovery violation, was the primary objective of Respondentâ€™s \r\n  motion.  â€œNow weâ€™d move, for one, to have this child go through a psychological \r\n  evaluation prior to continuing with this case because, based upon testimony \r\n  weâ€™ve heard and what weâ€™ve been given today, itâ€™s highly likely that some voice \r\n  told [victim] to say [Respondent] did this.â€  \r\nAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.  In order \r\n  to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the \r\n  trial court.  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731 \r\n  (1998).  In other words, the trial court must be given an opportunity to resolve \r\n  the issue before it is presented to the appellate court.  Toal, Vafai, &amp; \r\n  Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina, at 66 (S.C. Bar 1999).  \r\n  In this case, Respondentâ€™s counsel raised the issue before trial, and then again \r\n  during trial, at which point the trial judge denied the motion to have the victim \r\n  submit to a psychological examination.  \r\nWhether a court has the authority to order a victim in a sexual \r\n  assault prosecution to submit to a psychological examination is an issue of \r\n  first impression in South Carolina.  There is a split of authority in other \r\n  jurisdictions as to whether a court has the power to order a victim to submit \r\n  to a psychological examination and then, if so, under what circumstances.  \r\nSome jurisdictions give the trial judge discretion to order a victim \r\n  to submit to a psychological evaluation when the defendant can show a compelling \r\n  need for such an evaluation.  The trial courtâ€™s denial or grant of the defendantâ€™s \r\n  request is then reversed only if the trial judge abused his discretion.  \r\n  Pickens v. State, 675 P.2d 665 (Alaska App. 1984); Koerschner \r\n  v. State, 13 P.3d 451 (Nev. 2000); State v. Michaels, 642 \r\n  A.2d 1372 (N. J. 1994); Forbes v. State, 559 S.W.2d 318 (Tenn. \r\n  1977); State v. Delaney, 417 S.E.2d 903 (W. Va. 1992). [4]   In Delaney, the West Virginia Supreme \r\n  Court adopted factors for the trial judge to consider in determining whether \r\n  defendant had demonstrated a compelling need.  The factors are intended to assist \r\n  the trial judge in weighing the defendantâ€™s need for the examination against \r\n  the victimâ€™s right to privacy and include the following:\r\n\r\n  (1) the nature of the examination requested and the intrusiveness inherent \r\n    in that examination; (2) the victimâ€™s age; (3) the resulting physical and/or \r\n    emotional effects of the examination on the victim; (4) the probative value \r\n    of the examination to the issue before the court; (5) the remoteness in time \r\n    of the examination to the alleged criminal act; and (6) the evidence already \r\n    available for the defendantâ€™s use.    \r\n\r\nDelaney, 417 S.E.2d at 907.  In Delaney, \r\n  the trial judge denied the defendantâ€™s request for a psychological examination \r\n  of the victims (three young girls).  The supreme court affirmed because the \r\n  defendant failed to present â€œany reason, compelling or otherwise, to justify \r\n  the examination.â€  Id.\r\nOther courts have taken the position that compelling a victim to \r\n  submit to a psychological examination violates the public policy designed to \r\n  protect the victimâ€™s right to privacy and to prevent further trauma to the victim.  \r\n  People v. Espinoza, 95 Cal. App. 4th 1287 (Cal. App. \r\n  2002); [5]  State v. Horn, \r\n  446 S.E.2d 52 (N.C. 1994); State v. Looney, 240 S.E.2d 612 (N.C. \r\n  1978).  The North Carolina Supreme Court considered many of the same factors \r\n  as the Delaney court, including the conflicting interests of the defendant \r\n  and victim, before concluding that â€œâ€˜the possible benefits to an innocent defendant, \r\n  flowing from such a court ordered examination of the witness, are outweighed \r\n  by the resulting invasion of the witnessâ€™ right to privacy and the danger to \r\n  the public interest from discouraging victims of crime to report such offenses.â€™â€  \r\n  Horn, 446 S.E.2d at 452 (quoting Looney, 240 S.E.2d at 627) (emphasis \r\n  added). [6]   The court commented \r\n  further, â€œin balancing the rights of the victim and the defendant, . . . â€˜zealous \r\n  concern for the accused is not justification for a grueling and harassing trial \r\n  of the victim.â€™â€  Id. \r\nAlthough the North Carolina Supreme Court raises valid concerns \r\n  in Horn, a trial judge is vested with discretion to order a child \r\n  complainant to submit to an independent psychological evaluation, and the proper \r\n  exercise of this discretion, upon a showing of compelling need, sufficiently \r\n  protects victims from unnecessary or traumatizing invasions of their privacy.  \r\n  The guidelines for evaluating the existence of compelling need, which were delineated \r\n  by the West Virginia Supreme Court in Delaney, supra, safeguard \r\n  child complainants from unnecessary intrusions into their privacy, while also \r\n  protecting a defendantâ€™s right to confront his accuser.  We adopt these guidelines, \r\n  recognizing the serious and significant competing interests presented in this \r\n  case and similar cases involving child victims.  In such cases, a trial judge \r\n  is, and must be, vested with broad discretion in the conduct of trial.  The \r\n  judge is required to weigh competing interests to ensure the truth of a matter \r\n  is brought to light and justice to all parties before the court is served.    \r\n  An absolute bar to the exercise of judicial discretion to consider an order \r\n  for a psychological evaluation of child complainants ignores the necessary balance \r\n  which must be sought between a complainantâ€™s privacy rights and a defendantâ€™s \r\n  right to a fair trial.\r\n We disagree with the Horn reasoning supporting the North \r\n  Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion absolutely barring trial judges from exercising \r\n  their discretion in determining whether a psychological evaluation of a child \r\n  sexual assault complainant is appropriate.  \r\nIn Horn, the North Carolina Supreme Court recites three primary \r\n  concerns in support of its decision to absolutely bar trial judges from exercising \r\n  judicial discretion in determining whether a psychological evaluation of a child \r\n  sexual assault complainant is appropriate. First, the court suggests the negative \r\n  impact of forcing a complainant to submit to a psychological evaluation is always \r\n  a concern that outweighs any potential benefits to a defendant.  Horn, \r\n  446 S.E.2d at 626 (â€œthe possible benefits to an innocent defendant, flowing \r\n  from such a court ordered examination of the witness, are outweighed by the \r\n  resulting invasion of the witnessâ€™ right to privacyâ€¦ .â€) (citing Looney, \r\n  supra).  This is a sweeping generalization.  Where the complainant and \r\n  the perpetrator are often the only two witnesses to a sexual assault, fundamental \r\n  fairness dictates a defendant be entitled to request a psychological evaluation \r\n  of a child witness where there is compelling reason to question the complainantâ€™s \r\n  psychological status.  A child complainant who is incompetent to testify may \r\n  not have the capacity to give an accurate account of the facts.  Cases involving \r\n  child victims present special concerns that weigh in favor of allowing judicial \r\n  discretion to order psychological evaluations. \r\n  [7] \r\nSecond, Horn suggests the invasion of an individual victimâ€™s \r\n  privacy by a psychological examination, and the danger such a practice would \r\n  further discourage already hesitant victims from reporting sex crimes, weighs \r\n  against a trial judge exercising judicial discretion to order psychological \r\n  evaluations in such cases.  Horn, 240 S.E.2d at 627 (â€œthe possible benefits \r\n  to an innocent defendantâ€¦are outweighed byâ€¦discouraging victims of crime to \r\n  report such offenses and other potential witnesses from disclosing their knowledge \r\n  of themâ€) (citing Looney, supra).  The North Carolina Supreme \r\n  Courtâ€™s reasoning is unconvincing for two reasons.  First, the Delaney \r\n  factors set forth strict guidelines for the trial judge to consider in determining \r\n  whether compelling need exists.  These factors weigh in favor of complainants \r\n  and thereby suggest judges would rarely order psychological evaluations.  Therefore, \r\n  it is unlikely the rare occasions where judges do order psychological evaluations \r\n  would strongly discourage victims from reporting sex crimes.  Second, it is \r\n  highly unlikely the victim of a sex crime truly considers well in advance of \r\n  trial whether to report a sex crime because the court may possibly order \r\n  a psychological evaluation.  This is especially true when the complainant is \r\n  a child.  It is highly improbable a child complainant would be so cognizant \r\n  of the judicial process as to even consider the possibility of a judicially \r\n  ordered psychological evaluation.\r\nFinally, the North Carolina Supreme Court further supports its absolute \r\n  bar on judicial discretion by suggesting the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial \r\n  is sufficiently protected by the trial judge allowing the defendant to submit \r\n  evidence rebutting the complainantâ€™s mentally deficient status.  Horn, \r\n  446 S.E.2d at 54.  This assertion provides scant support for denying trial judgesâ€™ \r\n  discretion to consider ordering psychological evaluations of complainants.  \r\n  In particular, cross-examination of a complainant who is incompetent to testify, \r\n  a condition that could be established through a psychological evaluation, would \r\n  be wholly ineffective in protecting a defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial.  A \r\n  complainant who is incompetent to testify may not fully understand or convey \r\n  the implications of his or her psychological condition on cross examination.\r\nWe recognize the recent trend of protecting the rights of victims \r\n  as articulated by South Carolinaâ€™s General Assembly. [8]   We are completely in accord \r\n  with these protections afforded victims of crime.  However, a victimâ€™s rights \r\n  will not be compromised where compelling need is the standard for ordering \r\n  psychological evaluations of child complainants.  Therefore, no public policy \r\n  of this State is violated by the proper exercise of judicial discretion to consider \r\n  the need of such evaluations to meet the ends of justice.\r\nTurning to the present case, Respondentâ€™s counsel offered the questionable \r\n  mental health of the child victim as the primary reason he sought a psychiatric \r\n  evaluation of the victim.  Specifically, Respondentâ€™s counsel cited the child \r\n  victimâ€™s admission of hearing voices in his head that told him to say and do \r\n  mean things to his friends as justification for compelling the victim to undergo \r\n  a psychiatric examination.  Examined in light of the Delaney factors, \r\n  the victimâ€™s very young age (four at the time of the alleged assault and six \r\n  at trial), the fact that the victim was undergoing counseling, and spoke freely \r\n  of the incident (indicating he would not be further traumatized by another examination), \r\n  and the fact the victimâ€™s counselor testified victim was hearing voices during \r\n  the year when victim alleged the assault occurred, the judge would have been \r\n  within his discretion to order the victim to submit to an independent psychological \r\n  examination.\r\nConsidering these circumstances, particularly the evidence regarding \r\n  the victimâ€™s possible auditory hallucinations, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  order reversing Respondentâ€™s adjudication and remanding for a new trial. We \r\n  modify the order by limiting the trial judgeâ€™s discretion to order a psychological \r\n  examination to cases in which a child is the complaining victim.  Upon remand, \r\n  the court should consider any motion by Respondent for a psychological examination \r\n  of the child victim in light of the Courtâ€™s resolution of this novel issue, \r\n  applying the analysis we set forth in this case.\r\n II.&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Bond\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals acted beyond its jurisdiction \r\n  in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for bond pending his appeal.  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200(a) (Supp. 2003) states that \r\n  the Court of Appeals shall have the same authority to grant petitions for bail \r\n  as this Court would have in a similar case.  Under South Carolina Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 18-1-90 (1985), bail shall be allowed to the defendant in all cases in which \r\n  the appeal is from the trial, conviction, or sentence for a criminal offense.\r\nRule 221(b), South Carolina Appellate Court Rules (â€œSCACRâ€), provides \r\n  that the Court of Appeals retains jurisdiction until this Court grants or denies \r\n  a petition for certiorari.  \r\n\r\n  Where a petition for rehearing has been denied, the Court of Appeals shall \r\n    not send the remittitur to the lower court until the time to petition for \r\n    a writ of certiorari under Rule 226(c) has expired.  If a petition for writ \r\n    of certiorari is filed, the Court of Appeals shall not send the remittitur \r\n    until notified that the petition has been denied.  If the writ is granted \r\n    by the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals shall not send the remittitur. \r\n  \r\n\r\nRule 221(b), SCACR (2002).    \r\nThe State filed a Petition for Rehearing on February 4, 2002, before \r\n  the expiration of the fifteen days allotted in Rule 221(a), SCACR.  On February \r\n  7, the Respondent filed a Petition for Appeal Bond pending the outcome of the \r\n  Stateâ€™s appeal from the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.  The Court of Appeals denied \r\n  the Stateâ€™s Petition for Rehearing on February 21, 2002, and granted Respondentâ€™s \r\n  Petition for Appeal Bond on the same day.  The Court of Appeals had not returned \r\n  the remittitur when it granted the Respondentâ€™s Petition for Appeal Bond, and \r\n  this Court had not granted certiorari over the case yet.  Therefore, we find \r\n  the Court of Appeals retained jurisdiction over Respondentâ€™s case and acted \r\n  within its authority when it granted Respondentâ€™s petition.\r\nAdditionally, the State argues the Court of Appeals abused its discretion \r\n  in admitting Respondent to bail by failing to consider what guidelines would \r\n  be necessary to attempt to prevent Respondent from violating bond.  We disagree.\r\nThe factors to be considered in admitting a person to bail pending \r\n  appeal include the probability of reversal, the nature of the crime, the possibility \r\n  of escape, and the character and circumstances of the appellant.  Nichols \r\n  v. Patterson, 202 S.C. 352, 25 S.E.2d 155 (1943).  The Court of Appeals \r\n  set the amount of Respondentâ€™s bond ($1,000) and then remanded the matter to \r\n  the family court of Lexington County for that court to set the conditions of \r\n  his bond.  The family court set numerous restrictive conditions on Respondentâ€™s \r\n  bond, including prohibiting Respondent from having unsupervised contact with \r\n  children younger than twelve, and requiring him to take his prescribed medications, \r\n  attend school, be under the supervision of his mother, school officials, or \r\n  other responsible adult at all times, and to abide by a 6:00 p.m. curfew.  \r\n  In our opinion, the conditions set by the family court demonstrate that \r\n  the guidelines for bail were considered before Respondent was released on bail. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm as modified the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision \r\n  reversing Respondentâ€™s adjudication and granting Respondent a new trial.  In \r\n  addition, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision denying the Stateâ€™s request \r\n  to declare the appeal bond issued by the Court of Appeals null and void.\r\nWALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate \r\n  opinion in which MOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:     \r\n  I respectfully dissent because I believe that the special rule adopted by the \r\n  majorityâ€”giving trial judges the discretionary authority to order child victims \r\n  in sexual abuse cases to undergo psychological evaluationsâ€”undermines existing \r\n  trial procedures used to evaluate witness credibility and contravenes the recent \r\n  statewide movement to protect the rights of the sexually abused.  Therefore, \r\n  I believe that under no circumstances should a trial judge have the authority \r\n  to order child victims of sexual abuse to undergo psychological evaluations.  \r\n  Accordingly, I would reverse the portion of the court of appealsâ€™ decision holding \r\n  that the family court judge abused his discretion in failing to order the child \r\n  victim to submit to a psychological evaluation. \r\nOf the various tests applied \r\n  around the country to determine whether it is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion \r\n  to order child victims to submit to a psychological examination in sexual abuse \r\n  cases, the majority has chosen to adopt the factors used by the West Virginia \r\n  Supreme Court in State v. Delaney, 417 S.E.2d 903 (W. Va. 1992).  These \r\n  factors, as follow, are intended to guide the trial judge in determining whether \r\n  to order a psychological examination:\r\n\r\n  (1) the nature of the examination requested and the intrusiveness inherent \r\n    in that examination; (2) the victimâ€™s age; (3) the resulting physical and/or \r\n    emotional effects of the examination on the victim; (4) the probative value \r\n    of the examination to the issue before the court; (5) the remoteness in time \r\n    of the examination to the alleged criminal act; and (6) the evidence already \r\n    available for the defendantâ€™s use.    \r\n\r\nDelaney, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  at 907.\r\nI do not support the adoption \r\n  of these factors; rather, I agree with North Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s analysis \r\n  in State v. Horn, which led to the conclusion that â€œa trial judge \r\n  does not have the authority to order a victim to submit to psychological examination, \r\n  even when the victimâ€™s mental status is an element of the crime charged.â€  446 \r\n  S.E.2d 52, 54 (N.C. 1994).  In Horn, the court considered many of the \r\n  same factors as the Delaney court but reasoned that â€œâ€˜the possible benefits \r\n  to an innocent defendant, flowing from such a court ordered examination of the \r\n  witness, are outweighed by the resulting invasion of the witnessâ€™ right \r\n  to privacy and the danger to the public interest from discouraging victims of \r\n  crime to report such offenses.â€™â€  Id. at 53 (quoting State v. Looney, \r\n  240 S.E.2d 612, 627 (N.C. 1978)) (emphasis added). \r\n  [9]   On balance, the court found that â€œâ€˜zealous concern for the accused \r\n  is not justification for a grueling and harassing trial of the victim.â€™â€  Id.  \r\n\r\nI agree with the North Carolina court and find support for my view in practical \r\n  and policy considerations.  First, the invasion into an individual victimâ€™s \r\n  privacy by such an examination and the danger that such a practice would discourage \r\n  already hesitant victims from reporting sex crimes, adequately support, in my \r\n  view, a decision forbidding trial judges from having the authority to order \r\n  psychological examinations in these cases.\r\nSecond, the trial process \r\n  already contemplates the challenges associated with witness credibility and \r\n  overall fairness, and both trial judges and attorneys already have several alternatives \r\n  at their disposal to ensure that defendants receive a fair trial.  Most importantly, \r\n  perhaps, is the trial judgeâ€™s power to admit or deny the admission of evidence \r\n  already gathered concerning the witnessâ€™s mental health status.  Or as a last \r\n  resort, the trial judge may dismiss the case if the defendantâ€™s right to a fair \r\n  trial has been imperiled.    \r\nThird, a defendantâ€™s right \r\n  to a fair trial is sufficiently protected through the right to cross-examine \r\n  both the testifying victim and all other witnesses presented by the State.  \r\n  A well-prepared cross-examination has the potential to thoroughly undermine \r\n  a witnessâ€™s credibility.  Alternatively, the defense may call other witnesses \r\n  to attack the victimâ€™s credibility.  Finally, the defense may present its own \r\n  expert witnesses to rebut evidence concerning the victimâ€™s mental health status. \r\n\r\nFourth, as a practical matter, \r\n  the majorityâ€™s decision has the unanticipated consequence of creating a â€œtrial \r\n  within a trial.â€  In other words, if a judge determinesâ€”after weighing the Delaney \r\n  factors as advocated by the majorityâ€”that an examination should be ordered, \r\n  the â€œprimary trial,â€ the trial against the alleged abuser, is effectively put \r\n  on hold while the â€œsecondary trial,â€ the examination of the victim to ascertain \r\n  the victimâ€™s mental status, is conducted.  In this â€œsecondary trial,â€ victims \r\n  assume the role of the accused in the primary case.  This additional process \r\n  turns our notion of the adversarial process on its head by temporarily relieving \r\n  the State of its constitutional burden of proofâ€”to prove the defendant guilty \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubtâ€”and creating, instead, a hearing on the victimâ€™s mental \r\n  capacity.\r\nFifth, the General Assembly and \r\n  people of South Carolina have actively sought, in recent years, to protect the \r\n  rights of victims, particularly victims of sexual assault.  See Victimsâ€™ \r\n  Bill of Rights, S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 24 (providing that victims have the right \r\n  to be free from intimidation, harassment, or abuse throughout the criminal and \r\n  juvenile justice process); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-657 (Supp. 2002) (providing \r\n  that the testimony of a victim in a criminal sexual conduct prosecution need \r\n  not be corroborated); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-659.1 (Supp. 2002) (barring evidence \r\n  of victimâ€™s sexual conduct, opinion evidence of the victimâ€™s sexual conduct, \r\n  and reputation evidence of the victimâ€™s sexual conduct in prosecutions for criminal \r\n  sexual conduct under most circumstances).  Each of these provisions illustrates \r\n  the concerted movement toward protection of the victim in criminal sexual conduct \r\n  cases.  I believe that the majorityâ€™s decision undermines these efforts and \r\n  the intentions supporting these policy decisions.  \r\nSixth, the adoption of the Delaney \r\n  factors represents a radical change in the criminal trial procedure in this \r\n  state.  Evaluating witness credibility is an important function reserved for \r\n  judges and juries.  Allowing judges to order victim evaluations in sexual abuse \r\n  cases undermines the role of judges and juries and vests a great deal of power \r\n  in the psychologists who perform the evaluations. \r\nFinally, that the ordering of \r\n  psychological evaluations will be a rare occurrence, as the majority posits, \r\n  is of little consolation to the victims who are forced to undergo such evaluations.  \r\n  Moreover, I respectfully find the majorityâ€™s argument that child victims, in \r\n  particular, will not be dissuaded from reporting abuse since they are too young \r\n  to contemplate the hurdles ahead, unpersuasive.  To the contrary, a child victimâ€™s \r\n  inability to understand the adversarial process further justifies my position \r\n  on this issue, a position that I believe is consistent with the protective nature \r\n  of victimsâ€™ rights legislation in South Carolina.\r\nIn conclusion, I do not support \r\n  the majorityâ€™s decision giving trial judges discretion to order a criminal sexual \r\n  conduct victim to submit to a psychological examination.  Given that our legal \r\n  system is already designed to ensure fairness for all those who enter the courtroom \r\n  and that the special rule adopted today runs afoul of public policy in this \r\n  state, I would REVERSE the portion of the court of appealsâ€™ decision holding \r\n  that the family court judge abused his discretion in refusing to order a psychological \r\n  evaluation of the victim.  I agree, however, with the majorityâ€™s decision on \r\n  the appeal bond issue.\r\nMOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Respondentâ€™s verbal IQ is 84 (just below average), \r\n    but his performance IQ lags behind at 70, indicating he has a learning disability.  \r\n    His counselor stated he did not learn like other kids and experienced delays \r\n    in gross motor development as he grew up.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Respondentâ€™s mother (victimâ€™s grandmother) testified \r\n    the door to the bathroom always remained open when the boys were bathing, \r\n    and she checked in on them frequently, remaining in earshot continuously during \r\n    their baths and showers.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Respondentâ€™s counselor, John Higgins, certified \r\n    as an expert in the field of sex offender risk assessment, testified he had \r\n    counseled Respondent in twenty sessions during which Respondent had consistently \r\n    denied sexual contact with the victim.  Mr. Higgins testified, based on his \r\n    extensive experience with sex offenders, that he did not believe Respondent \r\n    had any sexual contact with the victim.  He explained that Respondent did \r\n    not fit the profile for a sex offender and in fact was naÃ¯ve about sex and \r\n    the sexual function of his own body parts.  Further, Mr. Higgins testified \r\n    that Respondent had admitted other serious wrongdoing, such as calling in \r\n    a bomb threat and stealing earrings, but had consistently denied any sexual \r\n    contact with the victim.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] The precise test developed by each different court \r\n    to determine when a psychological examination of a victim is warranted varies \r\n    from case to case. The New Jersey court, for example, discussed the various \r\n    ways a childâ€™s testimony could become â€œtaintedâ€ by interview tactics and adult \r\n    influence, and held that the defendant bears the initial burden of showing \r\n    some evidence that the victimâ€™s statements were the product of suggestive \r\n    or coercive interview techniques.  Michaels, 642 A.2d 1372.  If the \r\n    defendant meets that burden, a pretrial â€œtaintâ€ hearing is held in which the \r\n    defendant can offer testimony of experts to counter the stateâ€™s expertsâ€™ testimony.  \r\n    Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] The California Supreme Court wrote the seminal \r\n    case granting trial judges discretion to order psychological evaluations of \r\n    a victim upon a defendantâ€™s showing of compelling need in sexual assault cases.  \r\n    Ballard v. Superior Court, 410 P.2d 838 (Cal. 1966).  California courts \r\n    adhered to this rule until 1980 when the legislature prohibited psychiatric \r\n    examinations of complaining witnesses in sex crime cases.  Cal. Pen. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 1112 (2002).  The opinions cited in support of a trial courtâ€™s discretion \r\n    to order psychiatric examinations of sexual assault victims based on showing \r\n    of compelling need are not based on the California case law. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] In Looney, the North Carolina court held \r\n    that the trial judge has no discretionary power to require a victim to undergo \r\n    psychiatric examination before being permitted to testify.  The Looney \r\n    court found that to do so would be â€œa drastic invasion of the witnessâ€™ own \r\n    right of privacyâ€ and â€œin and of itself, humiliating and potentially damaging \r\n    to the reputation of the victim.â€  240 S.E.2d at 626.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] Jeffrey P. Bloom, Post-Schumpert Era Independent \r\n    Interviews and Psychological Evaluations of Child Witnesses, July/Aug. \r\n    S.C. Law. 40 (July/Aug. 1998) (arguing the State has an evidentiary advantage \r\n    that amounts to a violation of due process when the State is allowed an opportunity \r\n    to evaluate a child witness, but the defense is not).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  \r\n    S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 24, provides that victims have the right to be free \r\n    of intimidation, harassment, or abuse throughout the criminal and juvenile \r\n    justice process.  The proper exercise of judicial discretion based on compelling \r\n    need could hardly be considered intimidation, harassment, or abuse in our \r\n    justice system. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-657 (2003), provides that the \r\n    testimony of a victim in a criminal sexual conduct prosecution need not be \r\n    corroborated.  This provision fully supports the exercise of judicial discretion \r\n    in considering psychological evaluations.  Where one can be convicted on uncorroborated \r\n    testimony, it is imperative that his accuser be competent to testify.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-659.1 (2003), bars evidence of \r\n    a victimâ€™s sexual conduct, opinion evidence of the victimâ€™s sexual conduct, \r\n    and reputation evidence of the victimâ€™s sexual conduct under most circumstances. \r\n    While the statute clearly reflects the General Assemblyâ€™s intent to protect \r\n    victims of sexual assault, the proper exercise of judicial discretion in considering \r\n    and ordering a psychological evaluation of a complainant, as prescribed by \r\n    Delaney, does not contradict this protective provision.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  In Looney, the North Carolina court held that the trial judge \r\n    has no discretionary power to require a victim to undergo psychiatric examination \r\n    before being permitted to testify.  To require victims to undergo such evaluations, \r\n    the court reasoned, would be â€œa drastic invasion of the witnessâ€™ own right \r\n    of privacyâ€ and â€œin and of itself, humiliating and potentially damaging to \r\n    the reputation of the victim.â€  240 S.E.2d at 626.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25861","title":"Von Dohlen v.

Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-20(A) and 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(d) (Supp. 1991).Â  \r\n  The trial judge sentenced Petitioner to death for murder on the juryâ€™s recommendation \r\n  and twenty-five years for armed robbery.Â  The convictions and sentences were \r\n  affirmed on direct appeal.Â  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  689 (1996).\r\nPetitioner filed a PCR application in 1997 and later amended it.Â  The PCR judge \r\n  denied the application after a hearing in 1999.Â  We granted a writ of certiorari \r\n  to consider two questions raised by Petitioner:\r\n\r\n  I.Â  Does any evidence of probative value support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling that \r\n    Petitionerâ€™s trial attorneys were not ineffective in failing to adequately \r\n    prepare and present evidence during the penalty phase of the trial that Petitioner \r\n    suffered from a major mental illness at the time of the murder?\r\n  II.Â  Does any evidence of probative value support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling \r\n    that Petitionerâ€™s trial attorneys were not ineffective in failing to object \r\n    to the prosecutorâ€™s closing argument during the penalty phase of the trial \r\n    that jurors should put themselves in Victimâ€™s shoes?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the \r\n  Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, \r\n  466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).Â  There is a strong presumption \r\n  that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional \r\n  judgment in making all significant decisions in the case.Â  Strickland, \r\n  466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695; Cherry v. State, \r\n  300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  In order to prove counsel was ineffective, \r\n  the applicant must show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that there \r\n  is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the \r\n  trial would have been different.Â  A reasonable probability is a probability \r\n  sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.Â  Strickland, \r\n  466 U.S. at 687-694, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693-698; Rhodes \r\n  v. State, 349 S.C. 25, 561 S.E.2d 606 (2002); Johnson v. State, 325 \r\n  S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).Â  Thus, an applicant must show both error and \r\n  prejudice to be granted relief in a PCR proceeding.Â  Strickland, supra; \r\n  Scott v. State, 334 S.C. 248, 513 S.E.2d 100 (1999).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The burden is on the applicant in a post-conviction proceeding to \r\n  prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. \r\n  441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985).Â  An appellate court may affirm the PCR court's decision \r\n  when its findings are supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  \r\n  Cherry, supra.Â  However, an appellate court will not affirm the \r\n  decision when it is not supported by any probative evidence.Â  Holland v. \r\n  State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nI.Â  EXPERT TESTIMONY ABOUT PETITIONERâ€™S MAJOR MENTAL ILLNESS\r\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, witnesses testified Petitioner had been \r\n  a good husband, married for seventeen years; a good father, with four children \r\n  ages two through fourteen; and a dependable, likeable employee of grocery stores \r\n  and pawnshops.Â  Petitioner grew up in a very poor family and had been physically \r\n  abused and emotionally neglected as a child.Â  He had no prior criminal record.Â  \r\n  The violent murder was completely unexpected and out of character for a man \r\n  who had never displayed violent tendencies.\r\nWitnesses testified Petitionerâ€™s personality and demeanor underwent a dramatic \r\n  change when - about two weeks before Victimâ€™s murder - Petitionerâ€™s brother \r\n  was murdered by the brotherâ€™s father-in-law.Â  Petitioner became withdrawn, irritable, \r\n  and depressed.Â  He began abusing alcohol and Valium, an anti-anxiety medication.\r\nAt trial during the penalty phase, Dr. Michael Lampkin, a psychiatrist, testified \r\n  Petitioner at the time of the murder suffered from â€œadjustment reaction with \r\n  mixed features of emotions and conduct,â€ as well as pathological intoxication \r\n  from the abuse of alcohol and Valium.Â  Adjustment reaction is a disorder in \r\n  which a personâ€™s expression of grief exceeds what is normally expected.Â  It \r\n  is generally easily treatable and lasts no longer than three months.Â  On cross-examination, \r\n  Lampkin testified Petitioner did not have a chronic mental illness and did not \r\n  dispute the solicitorâ€™s assertion that adjustment reaction disorder was â€œpretty \r\n  small potatoesâ€ in the spectrum of mental illnesses.\r\n In the penalty phase closing arguments, the solicitor argued Petitioner did \r\n  not suffer from any mental or emotional disturbance and that the murder was \r\n  committed in â€œcold premeditation.â€Â  The solicitor contended, â€œHis brother Bill \r\n  dying, a less than perfect childhood, vagaries, ups and downs of life that we \r\n  all suffer.Â  His own witness, Dr. Lampkin, said adjustment reaction as he called \r\n  it, the stress.Â  Divorce could bring it on, business problems can bring it on.Â  \r\n  These are things every person goes through.Â  He could provide not one bit of \r\n  excuse.â€\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Lampkin testified that if he had been provided with additional \r\n  medical and psychiatric records that existed and were available before the trial, \r\n  he would have diagnosed Petitioner as suffering at the time of the murder from \r\n  â€œmajor depressive episodes with severe symptoms of anxiety and possible prepsychotic \r\n  features,â€ plus alcohol and Valium abuse.Â  \r\nDr. Lampkin identified six items that changed his opinion:Â  (1) the MMPI test \r\n  [1]  administered to Petitioner in 1990 while at the William S. Hall Psychiatric \r\n  Institute, a state hospital; (2) Petitionerâ€™s complete medical record from his \r\n  four months at the Hall Institute, including nursesâ€™ notes with numerous references \r\n  to Petitionerâ€™s depressed state, impaired memory, isolation, and hopelessness; \r\n  (3) the medical records of Petitionerâ€™s father indicating he suffered from chronic \r\n  depression and thus providing a genetic basis for Petitionerâ€™s chronic depression; \r\n  (4) the medical records of Petitionerâ€™s brother, John, who attempted suicide \r\n  shortly before Petitionerâ€™s trial, providing additional proof of a genetic predisposition \r\n  for mental disorders; (5) an MCMI test [2]  administered to Petitioner in 1990 by Dr. Harold \r\n  Morgan at the Hall Institute, revealing elevated scores for anxiety, depression, \r\n  and delusional disorders; and (6) Petitionerâ€™s records prepared in 1990 by Dr. \r\n  Don Hinnant, a psychologist, which revealed symptoms of major depression.Â  All \r\n  the records were potentially available to Petitionerâ€™s attorneys and expert \r\n  witnesses before his trial in 1991.\r\nLouisa Storen, a social worker who testified at trial about Petitionerâ€™s background \r\n  and family, testified at the PCR hearing she asked Lampkin to review Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  case shortly before trial to ensure she had not overlooked important issues.Â  \r\n  Storen provided a mostly oral summary of Petitionerâ€™s medical records and background \r\n  to Lampkin.Â  Storen did not expect Lampkin to testify at trial and, in a meeting \r\n  lasting no more than thirty minutes, â€œwhat I remember was talking very fast, \r\n  telegraphically trying to give him a bunch of information in a short period \r\n  of time before he saw [Petitioner].â€\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Dr. John DeWitt, a forensic psychiatrist, testified he \r\n  treated Petitioner for 3Â½ years beginning in August 1991, examining Petitioner \r\n  fifty-two times.Â  Petitioner suffered from a major mental illness at the time \r\n  of Victimâ€™s murder - severe depression with psychotic and suicidal tendencies.Â  \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s mental condition in May 1990 was far more serious than the usually \r\n  short-lived adjustment reaction disorder with which he was diagnosed.\r\nFurther, DeWitt testified Petitionerâ€™s severe depression was a condition to \r\n  which he was predisposed by a family history of mental illness and alcohol or \r\n  drug abuse, as well as a physically abusive childhood.Â  The condition likely \r\n  began in earnest when Petitioner was diagnosed with cancer in the 1980s.Â  It \r\n  was exacerbated by the suicide of his father in 1981, the murder of his brother \r\n  two weeks before Victimâ€™s murder, and Petitionerâ€™s attempts at self-medication \r\n  with alcohol and Valium.Â  Severe depression can cause unpredictable, irrational, \r\n  and chaotic behavior in people who never have exhibited such behavior, with \r\n  personality and lifestyle changes so drastic it is â€œalmost as if they had a \r\n  brain transplant.â€Â  Petitioner suffered a mental or emotional disturbance at \r\n  the time of Victimâ€™s murder, and due to his altered mental state â€œ[the murder] \r\n  was not a volitional thing but out of his conscious awareness or control.â€ \r\nPetitioner contends his trial attorneys were ineffective in failing to adequately \r\n  prepare and present evidence in the penalty phase of the trial that he suffered \r\n  from severe, chronic depression, a major mental illness, at the time of the \r\n  murder.Â  The attorneys failed to provide to Lampkin medical records and relevant \r\n  information that existed before trial.Â  If they had done so, Lampkin would have \r\n  reached the proper diagnosis and been able to correctly explain to jurors Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  mental state and inability to control his actions on the date of the murder.Â  \r\n  There is a reasonable probability this information could prompt the jury to \r\n  recommend a sentence ofÂ  life in prison rather than death.Â  Petitioner relies \r\n  in part on Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d \r\n  471 (2003).\r\nThe State contends the PCR judge correctly denied relief to Petitioner because \r\n  his trial attorneysâ€™ investigation and preparation of evidence on Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  mental state were sufficient to meet the Strickland standard.Â  The State \r\n  asserts Petitionerâ€™s attorneys presented extensive evidence of his mental and \r\n  psychological state, distinguishing this case from Wiggins, supra.\r\nWe conclude Petitionerâ€™s case is sufficiently analogous to Wiggins to \r\n  rely on it in reaching our decision, although counsel in Petitionerâ€™s case was \r\n  more diligent than counsel in Wiggins in presenting an accurate picture \r\n  of Petitionerâ€™s mental state.Â  In Wiggins, the United States Supreme \r\n  Court found the defendantâ€™s attorneys in a capital case were ineffective in \r\n  failing to expand their investigation of the defendantâ€™s background beyond cursory \r\n  reports in order to present compelling mitigating evidence on the defendantâ€™s \r\n  behalf during the penalty phase of the trial.Â  An adequate investigation would \r\n  have revealed crucial facts about the defendantâ€™s â€œsevere privation and abuse \r\n  in the first six years of his life while in the custody of his alcoholic, absentee \r\n  mother,â€ the â€œphysical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape during \r\n  his subsequent years in foster care,â€ the time he spent homeless, and his diminished \r\n  mental capacity.Â  Wiggins, 539 U.S. at ___, 123 S.Ct. at 2542, 156 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 493.\r\nWhile Strickland does not require counsel investigate every conceivable \r\n  line of mitigating evidence or require the submission of such evidence in every \r\n  case, â€œstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable \r\n  only to the extent that reasonable professional judgment support the limitations \r\n  on investigation. . . . A decision not to investigate thus must be directly \r\n  assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances.â€Â  Wiggins, 539 \r\n  U.S. at ___, 123 S.Ct. at 2541, 156 L.Ed.2d at 492 (quoting Strickland, \r\n  supra).Â  The Supreme Court held the defendant had proven prejudice because \r\n  there is a reasonable probability at least one juror would have struck a different \r\n  balance and returned with a different sentence had the jury been confronted \r\n  with the considerable mitigating evidence.Â  Id. at ___, 123 S.Ct. at \r\n  2543, 156 L.Ed.2d at 495; see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. \r\n  362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (defendantâ€™s attorneys were ineffective \r\n  in failing to investigate and present substantial mitigating evidence during \r\n  penalty phase of capital case, including description of abuse and neglect during \r\n  defendantâ€™s early childhood and testimony he was borderline mentally retarded; \r\n  counselâ€™s error prejudiced defendant because omitted evidence might have influenced \r\n  juryâ€™s appraisal of defendantâ€™s moral culpability).\r\nPetitioner has proved error and prejudice under the Strickland standard.Â  \r\n  Petitioner has demonstrated his attorneys erred in failing to adequately investigate \r\n  and prepare expert testimony about his mental condition as it existed at the \r\n  time of the murder.Â  While the attorneys exerted some effort, according to the \r\n  testimony ofÂ  Lampkin and DeWitt at the PCR hearing, it was insufficient.Â  The \r\n  absence of crucial medical records and related information which existed at \r\n  the time of Petitionerâ€™s trial prevented Lampkin from conveying an accurate \r\n  diagnosis and explanation of Petitionerâ€™s mental condition to the sentencing \r\n  jury.\r\nFurthermore, Petitioner has shown prejudice.Â  There is a reasonable probability \r\n  the outcome of the trial might have been different had the jury heard the available \r\n  information about Petitionerâ€™s mental condition as it existed at the time of \r\n  the murder.Â  The PCR judgeâ€™s decision is not supported by evidence of probative \r\n  value.\r\nII.Â  SOLICITORâ€™S CLOSING ARGUMENT\r\nThe black tennis shoes Victim wore on the day of the murder were entered into \r\n  evidence and identified by two witnesses.Â  The solicitor mentioned Victimâ€™s \r\n  shoes four times during his closing argument in the guilt phase of the trial. [3] Â  \r\nDuring closing arguments in the penalty phase, the solicitor expanded on the \r\n  same theme and explicitly urged jurors to â€œput yourself in Margaretâ€™s shoes, \r\n  size six.â€Â  At the PCR hearing, Petitionerâ€™s sister testified the solicitor \r\n  cried while holding up one of Victimâ€™s shoes during his closing argument in \r\n  the penalty phase, telling jurors â€œto put themselves in her shoes.â€Â  One of \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s trial attorneys testified he did not recall that particular statement \r\n  or the solicitor crying, but he may have been distracted and failed to notice \r\n  it.Â  Petitionerâ€™s attorneys did not identify any strategic reason for not objecting \r\n  to the arguments.\r\nPetitioner contends his trial attorneys were constitutionally ineffective in \r\n  failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s argument that jurors should â€œput yourself \r\n  in Margaretâ€™s shoes, size six.â€Â  The solicitorâ€™s statements constitute a prohibited \r\n  form of argument sometimes described as a â€œgolden rule argument,â€ in which jurors \r\n  are urged to place themselves in the position of a party, a victim, or a victimâ€™s \r\n  family member and decide the case from that perspective.Â  Petitioner asserts \r\n  the effect of such an argument is potentially to cause jurors to decide a case \r\n  based on passion and prejudice instead of a reasoned, impartial consideration \r\n  of evidence presented to them.\r\nThe State asserts the PCR judge correctly denied relief because a golden rule \r\n  argument is permissible during the penalty phase of a capital case in light \r\n  of Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 \r\n  (1991).Â  The State contends Payne allows the jury to consider victim \r\n  impact evidence; therefore, it is proper to allow the prosecutor during the \r\n  penalty phase to invite jurors to place themselves in the victimâ€™s position, \r\n  provided the invitation is grounded in the circumstances of the crime. \r\n  [4] Â  The State contends Petitioner has failed to show that statement was \r\n  sufficiently prejudicial to warrant relief.\r\nA review of a solicitor's closing argument is based upon the standard of whether \r\n  his comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting \r\n  conviction a denial of due process.Â  State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, \r\n  504, 388 S.E.2d 816, 822 (1990).Â  A solicitorâ€™s closing argument must be carefully \r\n  tailored so as not to appeal to the personal biases of the jury.Â  State v. \r\n  Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996); State v. Linder, \r\n  276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981).Â  The argument must not be calculated to \r\n  arouse the jurorsâ€™ passions or prejudices, and its content should stay within \r\n  the record and reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom.Â  Simmons \r\n  v. State, 331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998); Copeland, \r\n  321 S.C. at 324, 468 S.E.2d at 624.\r\nIn State v. White, 246 S.C. 502, 144 S.E.2d 481 (1965), the defendant \r\n  faced the death penalty for rape.Â  The solicitor argued in closing:\r\n\r\n  How would you like to see him coming in your bedroom or your daughter's bedroom \r\n    with this butcher knife? . . . I don't know whether you have got daughters \r\n    or not, I believe one or two of you are not married.Â  But everybody has got \r\n    a mother.Â  Not everybody, but most everybody has got a sister, daughters.Â  \r\n    Let him go, let him come back to Williamsburg County.Â  Let him come in your \r\n    wife's bedroom or your mother or daughters, any of them, what would you do? \r\n    . . . How, if this young lady was your sister, how would you feel?Â  How, if \r\n    she was your wife, how would you feel? How, if she was your daughter, God \r\n    only knows, how would you feel?Â  Gentlemen, she is all of that to somebody.Â  \r\n    She is a daughter, she is a sister, she is a wife.Â  And but for the grace \r\n    of God that could be your sister, your daughter or your wife. . . . But when \r\n    you get back there and consider giving him mercy like they are going to ask \r\n    you for, think about your wife, think about your daughters, think about your \r\n    sister or your mother, being in the same position as this young lady, with \r\n    a knife at her throat and a brute on top of her.\r\n\r\nId. at 504, 144 S.E.2d at 482.\r\nWe found the argument improper and reversed the conviction and death sentence.Â  \r\n  Although we did not describe it as a golden rule argument, we explained that\r\n\r\n  [a]n argument of this nature addressed to the jury tends to completely destroy \r\n    and nullify all sense of impartiality in a case of this kind.Â  Its logical \r\n    effect is to arouse passion and prejudice.Â  Jurors are sworn to be governed \r\n    by the evidence and it is their duty to regard the facts of a case impersonally. \r\n    We have no idea that the able Solicitor intended to arouse prejudice or passion.Â  \r\n    But statements of this character are well calculated to bring about this result.\r\n\r\nWhite, 246 S.C. at 506, 144 S.E.2d at 482 (quoting State v. Gilstrap, \r\n  205 S.C. 412, 32 S.E.2d 163 (1944), where the Court condemned an argument in \r\n  a death penalty case in which the solicitor urged jurors to â€œ[p]lace yourself \r\n  in the position that this girl was your own daughter, and go in and vote as \r\n  though it were your own daughter who had been raped,â€ but upheld the conviction \r\n  given the overwhelming evidence of the defendantâ€™s guilt).\r\nOther courts, including our own Court of Appeals, uniformly have condemned \r\n  and prohibited golden rule arguments in criminal and civil settings.Â  State \r\n  v.

State, 512 S.E.2d 294, 297 (Ga. App. 1999) (an improper \r\n  golden rule argument asks jurors to consider case, not objectively as fair and \r\n  impartial jurors, but rather from biased, subjective standpoint of litigant \r\n  or victim).\r\nWe reject the Stateâ€™s assertion that a golden rule argument, grounded in the \r\n  facts of a particular case, is permissible in light of Payne.Â  In that \r\n  case, the United States Supreme Court held that states may allow the admission \r\n  of victim impact evidence in capital cases without violating the Eighth Amendment, \r\n  provided such evidence is not so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial \r\n  fundamentally unfair and violates due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  \r\n  â€œA State may legitimately conclude that evidence about the victim and \r\n  about the impact of the murder on the victim's family is relevant to \r\n  the jury's decision as to whether or not the death penalty should be imposed.â€Â  \r\n  Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct. at 2609, 115 L.Ed.2d at 736 (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  Thus, it was proper in a brutal murder case for the grandmother of \r\n  a child victim to testify the child missed his murdered mother, and it was proper \r\n  for the prosecutor to discuss the continuing effect of the crime on the child \r\n  victim and his family during the penalty phase of the trial.\r\nHowever, consideration of victim impact evidence does not open the door to \r\n  golden rule arguments urging the jury to subjectively analyze a case solely \r\n  or primarily from the victimâ€™s viewpoint.Â  Payne allows a prosecutor \r\n  to call upon jurors to consider objectively a victimâ€™s uniqueness as \r\n  an individual and impact of the crime on the victimâ€™s family.Â  The Payne \r\n  Court did not approve the use of golden rule arguments in a capital case.\r\nThe Stateâ€™s reliance on a North Carolina line of cases is similarly misplaced.Â  \r\n  Those cases prohibit arguments in which jurors are urged to put themselves in \r\n  the victimâ€™s position, but allow a prosecutor to use evidence admitted at trial \r\n  to describe vividly a victimâ€™s waning moments of life to the jury during the \r\n  penalty phase of a capital case.Â  E.g. State v. Miller, \r\n  588 S.E.2d 857, 867 (N.C. 2003); State v. Anthony, 555 S.E.2d 557, 591-593 \r\n  (N.C. 2001).Â  Furthermore, the California Supreme Court in People v. Haskett, \r\n  640 P.2d 776 (1982), cited by the State, did not endorse golden rule arguments.Â  \r\n  â€œ[I]rrelevant information or inflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury's attention \r\n  from its proper role or invites an irrational, purely subjective response should \r\n  be curtailed,â€ although the â€œprosecution's invitation to the jurors to project \r\n  themselves into the role of the surviving victim in this case was insufficiently \r\n  inflammatory to justify reversal.â€Â  Id. at 790.\r\nPetitioner has shown error under the Strickland standard.Â  His attorney \r\n  erred in failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s explicit call for jurors to â€œput \r\n  yourself in Margaretâ€™s shoes, size six.â€Â  The argument indisputably asks jurors \r\n  to abandon their impartiality and view the evidence and potential sentence from \r\n  Victimâ€™s viewpoint.Â  As we recognized in White, 246 S.C. at 506, 144 \r\n  S.E.2d at 482, jurors should decide whether to recommend a death sentence based \r\n  on an impartial, rational, and careful evaluation of all the facts and circumstances \r\n  about the crime, the victim, and the defendant as presented at trial.Â  Jurors \r\n  must not strive - or be urged to strive - to analyze the evidence and potential \r\n  sentence solely or primarily through the eyes of the victim.\r\nIt is difficult to determine the precise impact of the solicitorâ€™s argument \r\n  on the juryâ€™s deliberation of the sentence, but the potential impact must be \r\n  carefully and thoroughly evaluated in a capital case.Â  See White, \r\n  246 S.C. at 507, 144 S.E.2d at 483 (â€œ[i]n view of the absolute discretion of \r\n  the jury with regard to the issue of mercy, it is impossible to determine whether \r\n  the argument actually had a prejudicial effect upon the verdictâ€); State \r\n  v. McClure, 342 S.C. 403, 409, 537 S.E.2d 273, 275 (2000) (â€œWe note the \r\n  evaluation of the consequences of an error in the sentencing phase of a capital \r\n  case [is] more difficult because of the discretion that is given to the sentencing \r\n  jury.Â  A capital jury can recommend a life sentence for any reason or no reason \r\n  at all.â€).\r\nOur studied review of the record leads us to conclude that, while Petitioner \r\n  has shown error, evidence of probative value supports the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling \r\n  that Petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice under the facts of this case.Â  \r\n  Petitioner has not shown there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s \r\n  error, the result of the trialâ€™s penalty phase would have been different.Â  The \r\n  solicitorâ€™s single comment, although improper, did not so infect the trial with \r\n  unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  Cf. \r\n  State v. Gaskins, 284 S.C. 105, 119, 326 S.E.2d 132, 141 (1985) (solicitorâ€™s \r\n  comment during closing argument in capital case that certain evidence was undisputed \r\n  because of defendantâ€™s failure to testify was harmless error beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt in context of entire record and in light of overwhelming evidence of guilt), \r\n  overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, \r\n  406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  Nonetheless, we strongly disapprove of such arguments \r\n  because their only possible use is to improperly arouse the passions and prejudices \r\n  of jurors, urging them to abandon their sworn role as fair and impartial arbiters \r\n  of the facts and view the evidence from an improper perspective.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling on Question I because Petitioner has shown \r\n  error and prejudice stemming from his attorneysâ€™ failure to adequately prepare \r\n  and present expert testimony during the trialâ€™s penalty phase about Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  alleged major mental illness as it existed at the time of the murder.Â  We affirm \r\n  the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling on Question II because, while Petitioner has shown trial \r\n  counsel erred in failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s improper closing argument, \r\n  he has not shown the single comment prejudiced him.Â  We remand this case to \r\n  circuit court for a new sentencing proceeding.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and PLEICONES, J., concur.Â  WALLER, J., dissenting in part and \r\n  concurring in part in a separate opinion in which MOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  I concur with the majority opinionâ€™s analysis of Issue \r\n  1.Â  I also concur with the majority to the extent it holds the solicitorâ€™s closing \r\n  argument, asking the jurors to place themselves in the victimâ€™s shoes, was improper.Â  \r\n  I disagree, however, with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that Von Dohlen was not \r\n  prejudiced by the solicitorâ€™s argument.Â  \r\nThe majority cites State v.

Cincinnati Ins. Co., 353 S.C. 363, 577 \r\n  S.E.2d 487 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural \r\n  Background\r\nIn October 1997, Belton and Charleston attorney Grady Query (Query) entered \r\n  into a contract entitled â€œLease Option to Buy,â€ transferring possession of a \r\n  commercial building and eleven and a half acres of land to Belton.Â  The contract \r\n  included (1) a lease provision directing Belton to pay Query monthly payments \r\n  of $1,200; (2) a purchase provision allocating 80 percent of Beltonâ€™s monthly \r\n  payments toward Beltonâ€™s purchase of the property; (3) a provision establishing \r\n  that the closing date would occur on or before November 1, 2002; and (4) a provision \r\n  creating a five percent penalty for late monthly payments.Â  The contract did \r\n  not provide, however, a provision that Belton would forfeit the equity in the \r\n  property upon nonpayment of the monthly payments.\r\nShortly after the contract was signed, Belton fell behind on his payments.Â  \r\n  In early 1998, Query wrote Belton two letters terminating the agreement and \r\n  demanding that Belton vacate the premises.Â  When Belton refused to vacate the \r\n  premises, Query filed a rule to vacate or show cause.Â  In April 1998, Belton \r\n  declared bankruptcy and received protection from an automatic stay, allowing \r\n  him to remain in possession of the property. \r\nIn August 1998, Belton applied to insure the building \r\n  with Cincinnati. [1] Â  Two days later, Belton applied \r\n  for insurance with General Star Insurance Company.Â  Belton testified that he \r\n  applied for insurance with General Star because he was unsure whether Cincinnati \r\n  would insure the building.Â  Approximately a week after applying for insurance \r\n  with both Cincinnati and General Star, the building was destroyed by fire.Â  \r\n  Therefore, at the time that the building was destroyed, both policies were in \r\n  effect, and Belton sought coverage under both policies.Â  \r\nWhen Belton filed a claim with Cincinnati, Cincinnati denied coverage, alleging \r\n  Belton lacked an insurable interest. \r\n  [2] Â  During Cincinnatiâ€™s investigation of Beltonâ€™s claim, Cincinnati hired \r\n  the Warren Group to conduct a fire analysis, which concluded that the fire was \r\n  set intentionally.Â  Belton testified that he was on vacation with his family \r\n  when the fire occurred.Â  Belton brought suit. \r\n  [3] \r\nDuring a deposition, counsel for Cincinnati asked \r\n  Belton if he had ever taken a polygraph test concerning the destroyed building.Â  \r\n  Belton answered that he had taken the test, but he claimed that the results \r\n  of the test were protected by the attorney-client privilege and refused to provide \r\n  the results.Â  Cincinnati filed a motion to compel, and, in turn, Belton filed \r\n  a motion to invoke the attorney-client privilege.Â  Although, the trial judge \r\n  granted Cincinnatiâ€™s motion to compel, Belton never testified about the polygraph \r\n  results because the trial court granted summary judgment before Belton could \r\n  be questioned again.\r\nBelton also refused to respond to Cincinnatiâ€™s request to admit, arguing that \r\n  the documents referenced in the request were not properly served in accordance \r\n  with Rule 56(a), SCRCP.Â  Cincinnati filed a motion to compel, which the trial \r\n  court granted, finding that the request properly incorporated documents by reference \r\n  already in Beltonâ€™s possession. Nevertheless, before the trial court ruled on \r\n  the motion, the issue was held moot because Belton complied with the request \r\n  before the motion could be granted.Â  \r\nAt trial, the judge granted Cincinnatiâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment.Â  Belton timely appealed and the court of appeals reversed, \r\n  holding that â€œa party holding an option to purchase has an insurable interestâ€ \r\n  and remanding questions of fact concerning (1) whether Beltonâ€™s option survived \r\n  Queryâ€™s attempts to terminate the agreement, and (2) the amount or extent of \r\n  Beltonâ€™s insurable interest in the underlying property. \r\nPetitioner-Respondent Cincinnati presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.Â \r\n    Did the court of appeals err in reversing the trial court, \r\n      finding that Belton had an insurable interest in the property insured?\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Respondent-Petitioner Belton brings the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    II.Â Â \r\n      \r\n    Did the trial judge err in ruling that the results of Beltonâ€™s \r\n      polygraph test were not protected under the attorney-client privilege?\r\n      \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Did the trial judge err in granting Cincinnatiâ€™s motion \r\n      to compel?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe trial court must grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 \r\n  S.C. 454, 462, 560 S.E.2d 606, 610 (2002).Â  When determining whether triable \r\n  issues of fact exist, all evidence and inferences drawn from the evidence must \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Osborne v. \r\n  Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001). \r\nInsurable Interest\r\nCincinnati argues that the court of appeals erred in finding that a question \r\n  of fact existed as to whether Belton had an insurable interest in the destroyed \r\n  property.Â  We agree.Â  Although we do not discount the possibility that an option \r\n  to purchase land may create an insurable interest, we find that Belton had no \r\n  insurable interest in the destroyed property because he did not have equity \r\n  in the property.Â  \r\nEquity and Insurable \r\n  Interest\r\nThe central issue of this case is whether Belton had an insurable \r\n  interest in the underlying property at the time he contracted for insurance \r\n  with Cincinnati.Â  Belton argues his option to purchase the property gave him \r\n  an insurable interest.Â  To accept this argument, we must find that Beltonâ€™s \r\n  option survived Queryâ€™s termination of the agreement. \r\n  [4] Â  Nevertheless, regardless of whether Beltonâ€™s option was enforceable, \r\n  we hold that Belton did not have an insurable interest in the underlying property \r\n  because he did not have any equity in the underlying property when he contracted \r\n  for insurance with Cincinnati.Â  Further, we reserve the question of whether \r\n  an option to purchase real property creates an insurable interest for a later \r\n  date.Â  \r\nOur holding that a party cannot have an insurable interest in an option to \r\n  purchase land if that party does not have equity in that land is consistent \r\n  with our jurisprudence concerning insurable interest.Â  Although, our courts \r\n  have not used the word â€œequityâ€, we have certainly equated a partyâ€™s insurable \r\n  interest in property with a partyâ€™s personal stakes in that property.Â  In Benton \r\n  &amp; Rhodes, Inc., v. Boden, the court of appeals held that â€œ[t]o have \r\n  an insurable interest in property, one must derive a benefit from its existence \r\n  or suffer a loss from its destruction.â€ 310 S.C. 400, 403, 426 S.E.2d 823, 825 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1993).Â  The next year, the court of appeals held that an insured may \r\n  not recover insurance proceeds in excess of his interest in the property.Â  Singletary \r\n  v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 316 S.C. 199, 202, 447 S.E.2d 869, 870 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994).Â  Therefore, our holding that an option cannot create an insurable \r\n  interest where its holder has no equity in the underlying property is consistent \r\n  with our prior rulings.\r\nAfter reviewing the record, it is clear that Beltonâ€™s \r\n  equity in the underlying property is de minimis at best.Â  It is unclear \r\n  how many monthly payments, if any, Belton made to Query.Â  But when Query sought \r\n  relief from the bankruptcy court, he filed a statement indicating that Beltonâ€™s \r\n  total arrearage was $7,810.Â  According to the terms of the contract, Belton \r\n  was to pay a $50 down payment and then $1,200 a month, with 80% of the monthly \r\n  payment going toward the purchase of the building.Â  Therefore, 80% of the Beltonâ€™s \r\n  monthly payments made to Query arguably constitute equity.Â  Nonetheless, Belton \r\n  has failed to provide any evidence that the equity he accumulated in the property \r\n  was not diminished and ultimately depleted because of his arrearages.\r\nIn addition, as plaintiff, Belton had the burden \r\n  to set forth specific facts, which included providing evidence that he had equity \r\n  in the property at the time he contracted for insurance and at the time of loss.Â  \r\n  The non-moving party may not rest on the mere allegations of his pleading to \r\n  withstand summary judgment but â€œmust set forth specific facts showing that there \r\n  is a genuine issue for trial.â€ SCRCP 56(e); Bravis v. Dunbar, 316 S.C. \r\n  263, 449 S.E.2d 495 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Because Belton has failed to provide such \r\n  evidence, we hold that summary judgment was proper.Â  We may not draw an inference \r\n  that Belton had an insurable interest without sufficient evidence to support \r\n  such a conclusion. \r\n Conclusion\r\nWe hold that because Belton has failed to show that he had any equity in the \r\n  destroyed property, he did not have an insurable interest in the property.Â  \r\n  If Belton had provided evidence that the equity he acquired through monthly \r\n  payments was in excess of his arrearages, plus interest accrued upon nonpayment, \r\n  he may have established that he held an insurable interest.Â Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  we need not make that determination at this time.Â  Further, because Belton did \r\n  not have an insurable interest in the underlying property, we need not address \r\n  Beltonâ€™s issues concerning the polygraph evidence and the request to admit.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ ruling, and uphold the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order granting summary judgment for Cincinnati and denying Belton coverage under \r\n  his policy with Cincinnati.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice John W.

Brown, Op. No. 2003-UP-274 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 15, 2003).Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRobert Brown (Respondent) was convicted by a jury of three counts of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct (CSC) in the first degree with a minor under the age of eleven, \r\n  four counts of CSC in the second degree with a minor between the ages of eleven \r\n  and fourteen, three counts of committing a lewd act on a minor, one count of \r\n  assault with intent to commit second-degree CSC with a minor, ten counts of \r\n  incest, and three counts of CSC in the first degree.Â  He was sentenced to the \r\n  maximum term of imprisonment on each conviction, with all sentences to be served \r\n  consecutively for a total sentence of 410 years.\r\nRespondent physically and sexually abused his daughters, who were adults at \r\n  the time of the trial, repeatedly over a period of years.Â  They testified Respondent \r\n  regularly beat them with a strap fashioned from a discarded tire if they disobeyed \r\n  him, refused to have sex with him, or revealed or attempted to reveal the sexual \r\n  abuse.Â  Respondent also often beat their mother, who died in 1986.Â  They testified \r\n  their fear and shame prevented them from revealing the sexual abuse to their \r\n  mother or anyone else.Â  One daughter was impregnated by Respondent and gave \r\n  birth to his son at age eleven, she revealed the abuse to her mother at the \r\n  age of fourteen.Â  Another daughter revealed the abuse to a school guidance counselor \r\n  at the age of thirteen.Â  Respondent beat both girls for doing so and the sexual \r\n  abuse continued unabated.\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed all sentences, except the three counts of first \r\n  degree CSC, which were reversed due to a lack of evidence on a material element \r\n  of the offense.Â  Respondentâ€™s remaining sentences totaling 320 years are not \r\n  affected by the reversals.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals, after reversing the first-degree CSC convictions \r\n    due to lack of evidence on one element of the offense, err in not remanding \r\n    the case for entry of judgment and sentencing on the lesser included offense \r\n    of second-degree CSC?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal is made in a criminal case, \r\n  the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, \r\n  not its weight.Â  State v. Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 319 S.E.2d 335 (1984).Â  \r\n  The accused is entitled to a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises \r\n  a suspicion of guilt.Â  State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 \r\n  (1984); State v. Brownlee, 318 S.C. 34, 455 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\n  The accused also is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to present \r\n  evidence on a material element of the offense charged.Â  State v. McHoney, \r\n  344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001); State v. Brown, 103 S.C. 437, 88 S.E. \r\n  21 (1916); State v. Gore, 318 S.C. 157, 456 S.E.2d 419 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\n  However, if the State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to prove \r\n  the defendantâ€™s guilt, or from which the defendantâ€™s guilt can be fairly and \r\n  logically deduced, the case must go to the jury.Â  On appeal from the denial \r\n  of a motion for directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence in a light \r\n  most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 385 S.E.2d \r\n  839 (1989); Schrock, 283 S.C. at 132, 322 S.E.2d at 452.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe indictment alleged Respondent violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-652(1)(a) \r\n  (2003) by committing first-degree CSC against an eighteen-year-old daughter \r\n  between December 1 and 30, 1987 (Count 19); against a sixteen-year-old daughter \r\n  on or about February 1, 1984 (Count 24); and against the same daughter when \r\n  she was nineteen years old between December 25 and 30, 1986 (Count 25).\r\nRespondent timely moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the three counts \r\n  of first-degree CSC, arguing the State had failed to present any evidence he \r\n  committed the acts through the use of aggravated force.Â  The trial judge denied \r\n  the motions, reasoning the presence of aggravated force was an issue of fact \r\n  for the jury. \r\nA divided Court of Appeals reversed.Â  The majority concluded the trial judge \r\n  erred in failing to grant a directed verdict because the State did not present \r\n  any evidence aggravated force accompanied any sexual acts occurring on the dates \r\n  specified in the indictments.Â  The majority declined to remand the case for \r\n  entry of judgment and sentencing on the lesser included offense of second-degree \r\n  CSC pursuant to State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 559 S.E.2d 847 (2002).Â  \r\n  Assuming the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction for second-degree \r\n  CSC, the majority found Muldrow distinguishable because both the greater \r\n  and lesser offenses (armed robbery and strong arm robbery) in Muldrow \r\n  were submitted to the jury.Â  In the present case, the State elected to proceed \r\n  only on the distinct criminal offense of first-degree CSC.\r\nSection 16-3-652(1)(a), under which Respondent was indicted and convicted, \r\n  provides:Â  â€œA person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree \r\n  if the actor engages in sexual battery with the victim and if any one or more \r\n  of the following circumstances are proven:Â  (a) The actor uses aggravated force \r\n  to accomplish the sexual battery.â€ \r\n  [1] Â  â€˜â€œAggravated forceâ€™ means that the actor uses physical force or physical \r\n  violence of a high and aggravated nature to overcome the victim or includes \r\n  the threat of the use of a deadly weapon.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(c) (2003).Â  \r\n  A conviction of first-degree CSC carries a maximum penalty of thirty years.Â  \r\n  Section 16-3-652(2).\r\n â€œA person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree if the \r\n  actor uses aggravated coercion to accomplish the sexual battery.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-653 (2003).Â  â€˜â€œAggravated coercionâ€™ means that the actor threatens \r\n  to use force or violence of a high and aggravated nature to overcome the victim \r\n  or another person, if the victim reasonably believes that the actor has the \r\n  present ability to carry out the threat, or threatens to retaliate in the future \r\n  by the infliction of physical harm, kidnapping or extortion, under circumstances \r\n  of aggravation, against the victim or any other person.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(b) \r\n  (2003).Â  A conviction of second-degree CSC carries a maximum penalty of twenty \r\n  years.Â  Section 16-3-653(2).Â  Second-degree CSC is a lesser included offense \r\n  of first-degree CSC.Â  State v. Summers, 276 S.C. 11, 274 S.E.2d 427 (1981), \r\n  overruled on other grounds by State v. McFadden, 342 S.C. 629, \r\n  539 S.E.2d 387 (2000).\r\nTo convict a defendant of first-degree CSC, the State must present evidence \r\n  the defendant committed a sexual battery and actually used aggravated \r\n  force at the time of the assault, i.e., the defendant overcame the victim through \r\n  the use of physical force, physical violence of a high and aggravated nature, \r\n  or the threat of the use of a deadly weapon.Â  The evidence must show the actual \r\n  use of aggravated force occurred near in time and place to the assault, such \r\n  that the effect of the aggravated force caused the victim to submit to the assault.Â  \r\n  State v. Lindsey, 355 S.C. 15, 20-22, 583 S.E.2d 740, 742-743 (2003) \r\n  (affirming denial of defendantâ€™s directed verdict motion on charge of first-degree \r\n  CSC where record contained evidence defendant physically forced victim to submit \r\n  to assault by confining her in automobile, grabbing her hands, getting on top \r\n  of her, and holding her down as she kicked, pushed and fought to get him off \r\n  of her); State v. Frazier, 302 S.C. 500, 397 S.E.2d 93 (1990) (affirming \r\n  attempted first-degree CSC conviction where State presented evidence that defendant \r\n  grabbed victim, forced her into woods, and ripped her clothes off in effort \r\n  to commit sexual battery); State v. Green, 327 S.C. 581, 491 S.E.2d 263 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997) (reversing denial of defendantâ€™s directed verdict motion on \r\n  charge of first-degree CSC where record contained no evidence defendant used \r\n  physical force, physical violence, or threatened use of deadly weapon while \r\n  sexually assaulting his minor daughter by shaving her pubic hair and performing \r\n  oral sex on her).\r\nThe presence of an aggravating circumstance necessary to sustain a prosecution \r\n  for assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) is not sufficient \r\n  to sustain a conviction for first-degree CSC.Â  Lindsey, 355 S.C. at 21, \r\n  583 S.E.2d at 742; Green, 327 S.C. at 585-586, 491 S.E.2d 264-265.Â  Such \r\n  aggravating circumstances include the infliction of serious bodily injury, great \r\n  disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, a difference in \r\n  the sexes, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, taking indecent \r\n  liberties or familiarities with a female, and resistance to lawful authority.Â  \r\n  E.g. State v. Foxworth, 269 S.C. 496, 238 S.E.2d 172 (1977). \r\n  [2] Â  â€œ[A] sexual battery constitutes first-degree CSC under Section 16-3-652(1)(a) \r\n  only if it was accomplished through the use of force and the force constitutes \r\n  aggravated force.â€Â  Lindsey, 355 S.C. at 21, 583 S.E.2d at 743 (quoting \r\n  Green, supra) (emphasis in original).\r\nIn contrast, the threat of the use of force or violence of a high and \r\n  aggravated nature, either during the assault or in the future, may constitute \r\n  aggravated coercion and is sufficient to sustain a conviction of second-degree \r\n  CSC under Section 16-3-653.Â  It is true that criminal sexual conduct, regardless \r\n  of which form it takes under the statutory scheme, is inherently a crime of \r\n  violence.Â  See State v. Green, 443 S.E.2d 14, 30 (N.C. 1994) (recognizing \r\n  inherently violent nature of rape).Â  Nevertheless, degrees of violence exist \r\n  in such crimes, as recognized in Lindsey, supra, and Green, \r\n  327 S.C. 581, 491 S.E.2d 263.Â  The definitions of aggravated force and aggravated \r\n  coercion, along with the different maximum penalties, reveal the Legislature \r\n  intended to draw a distinction between the actual use of force or violence \r\n  during an assault and the threat of force or violence during or after \r\n  an assault, with the former resulting in a conviction of greater degree and \r\n  a harsher maximum penalty.Â  See e.g. State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. \r\n  270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991) (it is well established that courtâ€™s primary \r\n  function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature, \r\n  and when the terms of statute are clear and unambiguous, court must apply them \r\n  according to their literal meaning).\r\nThe record in the present case contains testimony from each daughter about \r\n  the physical beatings at various times for disobedience, refusing to have sex \r\n  with Respondent, or revealing or attempting to reveal the sexual abuse.Â  The \r\n  Court of Appeals correctly concluded, however, that the record contains no evidence \r\n  Respondent used any aggravated force while sexually assaulting his daughters \r\n  on the dates specified in the indictment.Â  For example, the daughter did not \r\n  testify that Respondent beat her or brandished a deadly weapon at or about the \r\n  time he sexually assaulted her between December 1 and 30, 1987.Â  Thus, the Court \r\n  of Appeals properly reversed Respondentâ€™s convictions for first-degree CSC.\r\n It is a fundamental concept of criminal law that the State must prove beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt all the elements of the offense charged against the defendant.Â  \r\n  When the State fails to present sufficient proof of all the elements, a conviction \r\n  must be reversed and a judgment for the defendant must be rendered under the \r\n  principles of Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d \r\n  1 (1978). [3] Â  See also \r\n  State v. Gregorie, 339 S.C. 2, 528 S.E.2d 77 (2000) (relying on Burks \r\n  to find that second trial in magistrateâ€™s court after circuit court, which on \r\n  appeal overturned motoristâ€™s speeding conviction due to insufficient evidence, \r\n  would violate motoristâ€™s double jeopardy rights).\r\nThe Burks Court distinguished between a reversal based on insufficient \r\n  evidence and one based on errors in the trial proceedings.Â  The Double Jeopardy \r\n  Clause does not preclude the State from retrying a defendant whose conviction \r\n  is set aside because of an error in the proceedings such as incorrect receipt \r\n  of evidence, erroneous jury instructions, or prosecutorial misconduct.Â  Burks, \r\n  437 U.S. at 13-15, 148-2149; Riddle v. State, 314 S.C. 1, 443 S.E.2d \r\n  557 (1994). \r\nWhile Respondentâ€™s convictions were properly reversed the question remains \r\n  whether Respondentâ€™s case should be remanded for sentencing on three counts \r\n  of the lesser included offense of second-degree CSC.Â  In Muldrow, 348 \r\n  S.C. 264, 559 S.E.2d 847, we found evidence on the element of a deadly weapon \r\n  legally insufficient to sustain a conviction for armed robbery. [4] Â  However, we remanded the case for sentencing on the lesser \r\n  included offense of strong arm robbery, which also had been charged to the jury.Â  \r\n  â€œWhere the conviction is insufficient to sustain a conviction on the greater \r\n  offense, but is legally sufficient to support a conviction on the lesser, the \r\n  Court on appeal may direct the entry of judgment on the lesser offense.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 269-270, 559 S.E.2d at 850; see also Mathis v. State, 355 S.C. \r\n  87, 93 n.5, 584 S.E.2d 366, 369 n.5 (2003) (where conviction for first-degree \r\n  burglary was vacated due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Court rejected \r\n  Stateâ€™s argument that case should be remanded for entry of judgment against \r\n  defendant on lesser included offense of second degree burglary because that \r\n  offense was not submitted to jury).\r\nMuldrow marked the first time we remanded a case for entry of judgment \r\n  and sentencing on a lesser included offense after reversing a conviction for \r\n  lack of evidence.Â  For ease of use, we will refer to this option as a â€œsentencing \r\n  remand.â€Â  \r\nNumerous state and federal courts have approved of the practice of a sentencing \r\n  remand in appropriate circumstances, although not all have addressed the issue \r\n  raised in the present case.Â  E.g. Muldrow, 348 S.C. at 269-270, \r\n  559 S.E.2d at 850; Austin v. United States, 382 F.2d 129, 140-142 (D.C. \r\n  Cir. 1967), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Foster, \r\n  783 F.2d 1082 (1986); State v. Haynie, 867 P.2d 416 (N.M. 1994); State \r\n  v. Dunn, 850 P.2d 1201, 1209-1211 (Utah 1993) (all expressing majority view \r\n  and listing cases); James A. Shellenberger &amp; James A. Strazella, The \r\n  Lesser Included Offense Doctrine and the Constitution:Â  The Development of Due \r\n  Process and Double Jeopardy Remedies, 79 Marquette L.R. 1, 183-189 (Fall \r\n  1995) (discussing modification of criminal judgment by appellate courts, sources \r\n  of power for this rule including constitutions, statutes, rules, or courtâ€™s \r\n  inherent authority, and listing cases).\r\nSome courts have concluded a sentencing remand may be appropriate regardless \r\n  of whether the lesser included offense was charged to the jury.Â  United States \r\n  v. Hunt, 129 F.3d 739, 745-746 (5th Cir. 1997) (concluding that although \r\n  the fact jury was not instructed on lesser included offense goes to the prejudice \r\n  prong of the analysis, such an instruction is not a condition precedent to a \r\n  sentencing remand); State v. Briggs, 787 A.2d 479, 486-487 (R.I. 2001) \r\n  (approving sentencing remand where, although jury was not instructed on lesser \r\n  offense, defendantâ€™s trial testimony constituted evidence meeting all elements \r\n  of lesser included offense of larceny); State v. Farrad, 753 A.2d 648, \r\n  659 (N.J. 2000) (reversing case for new trial but noting that â€œguilty verdict \r\n  may be molded to convict on a lesser-included offense even if the jury was not \r\n  instructed on that offense if (1) defendant has been given his day in court, \r\n  (2) all the elements of the lesser included offense are contained in the more \r\n  serious offense and (3) defendantâ€™s guilt of the lesser included offense is \r\n  implicit in, and part of, the jury verdictâ€) (internal quotes omitted); Shields \r\n  v. State, 722 So.2d 584 (Miss. 1998) (reviewing cases on both sides of the \r\n  issue and, in a divided opinion, holding that a sentencing remand may be proper \r\n  even though the lesser included offense was not charged to the jury; majority \r\n  concluded the result was appropriate because record contained evidence sufficient \r\n  to support a conviction on the lesser offense); People v. Patterson, \r\n  532 P.2d 342 (Colo. 1975) (sentencing remand may be proper even though lesser \r\n  included offense was not charged to jury; court reasoned defendant has been \r\n  given his day in court and his guilt of lesser included offense is implicit \r\n  and part of juryâ€™s verdict on greater offense); State v. Villa, 82 P.3d \r\n  46, 53-55 (N.M. App. 2003) (following Shields, supra, to hold \r\n  that sentencing remand may be proper even though lesser included offense was \r\n  not charged to jury), cert. granted December 2, 2003.\r\nOther courts will not approve a sentencing remand unless the lesser included \r\n  offense was submitted to the jury.Â  United States v. Dinkane, 17 F.3d \r\n  1192, 1198 (9th Cir. 1994) (remanding for sentencing on lesser included offense \r\n  of unarmed bank robbery where evidence was insufficient to support conviction \r\n  on armed bank robbery; lesser included offense must be submitted to jury as \r\n  condition precedent to sentencing remand); Ex parte Roberts, 662 So.2d \r\n  229, 232 (Ala. 1995) (â€œIt is well established that if an appellate court holds \r\n  the evidence insufficient to support a juryâ€™s guilty verdict on a greater offense, \r\n  but finds the evidence sufficient to support a conviction on a lesser included \r\n  offense, it may enter a judgment on that lesser included offense, provided that \r\n  the jury was charged on the lesser included offenseâ€); State v. Myers, \r\n  461 N.W.2d 777, 778 (Wis. 1990) (in case of first impression, court held â€œthat \r\n  the court of appeals may not direct the circuit court to enter a judgment of \r\n  conviction of a lesser included offense when a jury verdict of guilty of the \r\n  greater offense is reversed for insufficient evidence and the jury was not instructed \r\n  on the lesser included offenseâ€); State v. Scielzo, 460 A.2d 951, 958 \r\n  (Conn. 1983) (finding sentencing remand was proper where jury was instructed \r\n  on the various degrees of larceny, and although evidence was insufficient to \r\n  sustain conviction for second-degree larceny, it was sufficient to sustain conviction \r\n  for fourth-degree larceny); Collier v. State, 999 S.W.2d 779, 782 (Tex. \r\n  Crim. App. 1999) (following Myers, supra, and holding in case \r\n  of first impression that appellate court may reform judgment to conviction of \r\n  lesser included offense only if (1) court finds the evidence is insufficient \r\n  to support conviction of charged offense but sufficient to support conviction \r\n  on lesser included offense and (2) either the jury was instructed on lesser \r\n  included offense or one of parties asked for but was denied such an instruction). \r\n\r\nAs noted by the majority in Shields, 722 So.2d at 586, any constitutional \r\n  infirmity in the sentencing remand rule apparently has been resolved in dicta \r\n  by the United States Supreme Court in Rutledge v. United States, 517 \r\n  U.S. 292, 305-306, 116 S.Ct. 1241, 1250, 134 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996).Â  The Rutledge \r\n  Court generally approved of the practice followed by federal appellate courts \r\n  in which the court may direct the entry of judgment for a lesser included offense \r\n  when a conviction for a greater offense is reversed on grounds that affect only \r\n  the greater offense.Â  Neither the Rutledge Court nor the Supreme Court \r\n  cases it cited have addressed the specific issue raised in the present case.\r\n We conclude the view espoused by the dissenting justices in Shields, \r\n  supra, and other cases expressing a similar view, offer an approach to \r\n  sentencing remands that is more consistent with the concepts of due process \r\n  and the role of appellate courts as developed in South Carolina.Â  As provided \r\n  in Muldrow and Mathis, we will consider a sentencing remand only \r\n  when the lesser included offense has been properly charged to the jury.Â Â  We \r\n  reach this conclusion for several reasons.\r\nFirst, an appellate court does not sit as a factfinder in a criminal case and \r\n  should avoid resolving cases in a manner which appears to place the appellate \r\n  court in the jury box.Â  An appellate court reviews the evidence only to determine \r\n  whether it was sufficient to submit a charge to the jury, or whether a directed \r\n  verdict of acquittal should have been granted due its insufficiency.Â  E.g. \r\n  Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 319 S.E.2d 335; Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 \r\n  S.E.2d 450.\r\nSecond, and in a related vein, this view preserves the important distinction \r\n  between an appellate determination the record contains sufficient evidence to \r\n  support a guilty verdict and a jury determination the State proved its case \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Shields, 722 So.2d at 588 (Sullivan, J., \r\n  dissenting); Myers, 461 N.W.2d at 782 (recognizing and enforcing this \r\n  â€œcrucial distinctionâ€).\r\nMoreover, the United States Supreme Court recently has re-emphasized the â€œconstitutional \r\n  protections of surpassing importanceâ€ contained in the Fourteenth Amendmentâ€™s \r\n  due process clause and the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, which â€œindisputably \r\n  entitle a criminal defendant to a jury determination that [he] is guilty of \r\n  every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  \r\n  Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 476-477, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2356, \r\n  147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, \r\n  any fact that increases penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory \r\n  maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt) (internal \r\n  quotes omitted); In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 361-62, 90 S.Ct. 1068, \r\n  1071, 25 L.Ed.2d 368, 373-74 (1970) (due process requires the government to \r\n  prove every element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt); see \r\n  also Blakely v. Washington, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (2004) (majority \r\n  of sharply divided Court, applying Apprendi, held that sentencing judge \r\n  may not impose a longer â€œexceptionalâ€ sentence under state sentencing guidelines \r\n  scheme by making a judicial determination that defendant who was pleading guilty \r\n  to kidnapping offense acted with â€œdeliberate crueltyâ€; defendant has right under \r\n  Sixth Amendment to require prosecution to prove facts supporting such a finding \r\n  to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, \r\n  122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002)Â  (applying Apprendi to hold that \r\n  Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial precludes a procedure in which a sentencing \r\n  judge, sitting without a jury, is allowed to find an aggravating circumstance \r\n  necessary for imposition of the death penalty, and overruling inconsistent precedent). \r\n  [5] \r\nThird, when a lesser included offense is submitted the jury, a jury which returns \r\n  a verdict of guilty on the greater offense necessarily weighed evidence relating \r\n  to the lesser offense in order to reach a verdict on the greater offense.Â  In \r\n  such cases, â€œit can be said with some degree of certainty that a [sentencing \r\n  remand] is but effecting the will of the fact finder within the limitations \r\n  imposed by law; and, that the appellate court is simply passing on the â€˜sufficiencyâ€™ \r\n  of the implied verdict.Â  When, however, no instruction at all has been offered \r\n  on the lesser offense, second guessing the jury becomes far more speculative.â€Â  \r\n  Shields, 722 So.2d at 588 (Sullivan, J., dissenting); Myers, 461 \r\n  N.W.2d at 780-782 (explaining that a verdict in which the jury was instructed \r\n  only on the greater offense, and the conviction is reversed on appeal due to \r\n  insufficient evidence, is too unreliable to remand the case for sentencing on \r\n  a lesser included offense). \r\nFourth, when the jury could have explicitly returned a verdict on the lesser \r\n  offense, the defendant is well aware of his potential liability for the lesser \r\n  offense and usually will not be prejudiced by the modification of the judgment \r\n  from the greater to the lesser offense.Â  Scielzo, 460 A.2d at 958.\r\nFifth, adopting a practice of remanding for sentencing on a lesser included \r\n  offense when that offense has not been submitted to the jury may prompt the \r\n  State to avoid requesting or agreeing to submit a lesser included offense to \r\n  the jury.Â  As recognized by the United States Supreme Court, one reason a defendant \r\n  is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense when supported by \r\n  the evidence is to prevent a jury - when the defendant plainly is guilty of \r\n  some offense - from finding the defendant guilty of the greater offense because \r\n  the only alternative is to let him walk free.Â  Keeble v. United States, \r\n  412 U.S. 205, 212-213, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 1997-1998, 36 L.Ed.2d 844, 850 (1973).\r\nSixth, the State would obtain an unfair and improper strategic advantage if \r\n  it successfully prevents the jury from considering a lesser included offense \r\n  by adopting an â€œall or nothingâ€ approach at trial, but then on appeal, perhaps \r\n  recognizing the evidence will not support a conviction on the greater offense, \r\n  is allowed to abandon its trial position and essentially concede the lesser \r\n  included offense should have been submitted to the jury.Â  Shields, 722 \r\n  So.2d at 588 (Sullivan, J., dissenting) (prosecutor will carefully consider \r\n  objecting to submission of lesser included offense when facing possibility of \r\n  a retrial should the withholding of the instruction prove error on appeal).\r\nSeventh, the trial courtâ€™s ruling on which offenses will be submitted to the \r\n  jury affects how both parties prepare and present their opening statements, \r\n  case in chief, and closing arguments.Â  The defendant may well have foregone \r\n  a particular defense or strategy due to the trial courtâ€™s rejection of a lesser \r\n  included offense.Â  Allowing the State to freely switch horses in midstream may \r\n  result in unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  See Myers, 461 N.W.2d \r\n  at 780-782 (recognizing parties formulate their trial strategies based on offenses \r\n  charged to jury and concluding it would be unfair and improper to allow state \r\n  to change its strategy on appeal in effort for appellate court to â€œrescue it \r\n  from a trial strategy that went awryâ€).\r\nIn sum, we clarify Muldrow as follows:Â  When a conviction is reversed \r\n  due to insufficient evidence, we will consider remanding a case for sentencing \r\n  on a lesser included offense only when (1) the evidence adduced at trial fails \r\n  to support one or more elements of the crime of which appellant was convicted; \r\n  (2) the jury was explicitly instructed it could find the defendant guilty of \r\n  the lesser included offense and was properly instructed on the elements of that \r\n  offense; (3) the record on appeal contains sufficient evidence supporting each \r\n  element of the lesser included offense; (4) the State seeks a sentencing remand \r\n  on appeal; (5) the defendant will not be unduly or unfairly prejudiced; and \r\n  (6) the Court is convinced justice will be served by such a result after carefully \r\n  considering the record as well as the interests and concerns of both the defendant \r\n  and the victim of the crime.Â  When a conviction is reversed due to insufficient \r\n  evidence and this analysis indicates a sentencing remand is inappropriate, double \r\n  jeopardy will bar retrial on the charge.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ rejection of the Stateâ€™s request for a sentencing \r\n  remand on the three first-degree CSC convictions because the lesser included \r\n  offense of second-degree CSC was not submitted to the jury.Â  As Respondentâ€™s \r\n  first-degree convictions were reversed due to a lack of evidence on a material \r\n  element of the offense, retrial of Respondent on those three charges is barred \r\n  by principles of double jeopardy.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.
